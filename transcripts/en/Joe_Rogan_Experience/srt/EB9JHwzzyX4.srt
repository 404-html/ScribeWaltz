1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,530
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,500
two.
That countdown gives me anxiety.

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,910
I got to stop doing the countdown.
See,

4
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,770
look,
I spilled my fucking Alpha brain.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,410
God Damn it.
What is Alpha brain?

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,400
It's a brain juice.
It's like a cognitive enhancing

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,990
supplement.
Really?

8
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:20,700
Yeah.
You ever fuck with nootropics?

9
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,990
You know what nootropics are?
No.

10
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:23,210
Do you have an extra one?
For sure.

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,150
For sure.
Nootropics are essentially the building

12
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:32,010
blocks for human neurotransmitters.
They improve your memory not to

13
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,680
radically,
not like a,

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,760
have you ever fucked with modafinil or
any of that stuff?

15
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,350
No.
No,

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,260
no.
Modafinil is like a pro vigil.

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,750
It's um,
they give it to a fighter pilot.

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,640
Yeah.
I'm talking about it helps keep them

19
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,100
awake.
Oh,

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,300
it was a doctor.
So yeah.

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,660
You have a doctor?
My wife,

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,810
my wife is a doctor.
Oh,

23
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:50,190
your wife's a doctor.
Oh,

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,200
that's perfect.
So she knows about all that jazz.

25
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,870
Um,
but there was just an article recently

26
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,570
about it.
Improving cognitive performance.

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,160
You're going to probably have to bite
into that.

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,353
You got it?
Yup.

29
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,340
Um,
it's good to meet you,

30
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:04,040
man.
I've opened it.

31
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,880
I've been a fan forever.
Thank you.

32
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:06,960
Me Too.
Looking forward.

33
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,350
Uh,
I've enjoyed your writing for sure.

34
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,220
And,
uh,

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,750
did you get that?
You got there?

36
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,370
I don't know.
Do I have to buy this?

37
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,280
Here we go.
Here we get scissors.

38
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,980
Jamie's get scissors for you if you
don't want to fuck with that.

39
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,150
I got it.
I got it.

40
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,620
Here we go.
Um,

41
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,710
so let's talk about what we were just
talking about.

42
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,740
You were,
you wrote a book with a guy about drug

43
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:31,290
dealing and he was gonna come on wearing
a mask.

44
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,560
He wanted to come on wearing a,
a Barack Obama mask.

45
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,470
Actually.
Uh,

46
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,913
it's

47
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,130
really,
really funny.

48
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,890
The whole story is really fun.
I'm writing this book.

49
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,150
Um,
oh,

50
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,340
I spelled it too.
Um,

51
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,800
it's called the business secrets of drug
dealing.

52
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,480
Uh,
you can find

53
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,540
that@businesssecretsofdrugdealing.com.
Um,

54
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,790
and I'm serializing it,
uh,

55
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,340
but basically,
uh,

56
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,130
somebody I knew for ages,
um,

57
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,870
in a completely different capacity,
uh,

58
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,210
sort of came out to me last year and
said,

59
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,440
um,
you know,

60
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:10,040
I've been a high level of drug dealer
for,

61
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,460
for a long time,
basically my whole life.

62
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,570
And wanted to tell a story about,
uh,

63
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,560
you know,
sort of the,

64
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,750
the whole progression of his life.
What kind of drugs,

65
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,510
uh,
only things that grow out of the ground.

66
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,550
So,
uh,

67
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,630
he started off,
um,

68
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:26,230
this is,
uh,

69
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,510
this is an African American guy.
Uh,

70
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:31,030
he started off bleed or not selling
mushrooms.

71
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,530
Uh,
he,

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,560
he sort of grew up half in the projects
and half and in an upscale suburb.

73
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,800
Uh,
and he in the upscale suburb,

74
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:44,110
he sold mushrooms,
which he,

75
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,150
um,
uh,

76
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,180
basically got through mail order at a
time early in the sort of history of the

77
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:54,490
Internet when there were some loopholes
about things you get spores,

78
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:55,091
right?
Yeah.

79
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,820
Well actually you could get the actual
railing.

80
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,683
Yeah.
Yeah.

81
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,330
Um,
so he ends up having this whole career.

82
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,090
Uh,
uh,

83
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,860
and he wanted to,
to sort of explain to me what the rules

84
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,330
of the game where,
uh,

85
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:16,510
and do sort of a book version of the 10
Crack Commandments.

86
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,950
Uh,
and so we sat down and,

87
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,010
um,
we couldn't quite figure out how to do

88
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:27,040
it at first,
but we ended up essentially doing a sort

89
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,670
of fictionalized version of,
uh,

90
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,590
of his life.
Um,

91
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,490
and the progression is amazing because
he,

92
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,850
he goes from being a dealer in all these
different parts of the country in

93
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,170
different social spheres.

94
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,080
He's in college,
he deals to rich,

95
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,020
white kids.
He deals on the street and,

96
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,460
and,
and,

97
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,500
you know,
tough urban neighborhoods and then ends

98
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,560
up sort of in the legal business,
uh,

99
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,320
in this state,
uh,

100
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,930
and lawyer,
no,

101
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:01,270
no,
no,

102
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,691
no,
no,

103
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:03,280
no.
He legal marijuana.

104
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,510
Oh,
yeah.

105
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,740
Yeah.
Uh,

106
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:08,830
and so he's describing that world,
which is not,

107
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,050
um,
there are a lot of misconceptions about

108
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:11,711
it.
Uh,

109
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,290
there are,
there are some things about it that are,

110
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,900
um,
not known terribly well.

111
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:17,740
Like,
you know,

112
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,890
what do you do when you work,
uh,

113
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,641
you know,
at a,

114
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,460
at a farm and,
uh,

115
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,010
your crop test dirty,
you know,

116
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,720
with a,
with a contaminant.

117
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,040
Um,
well,

118
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,170
you know,
not everybody just throws it away,

119
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,020
you know,
a lot of that stuff ends up shipped

120
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,210
across country,
goes to other markets.

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,210
Uh,
and he sort of describes a lot of this,

122
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,680
like what kind of contaminants would
that be?

123
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,960
Like fungal or past to like a,
like a,

124
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:46,330
like a fungus,
uh,

125
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,620
something like that.
Uh,

126
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,011
then,
you know,

127
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,810
there are labs that basically have to
clear,

128
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,741
uh,
you know,

129
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,810
from what I understand,
um,

130
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,540
that have to clear each of the crops.
And,

131
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,640
uh,
and there are situations where,

132
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,490
you know,
there's a whole bunch of crop and you've

133
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:02,530
got workers that have to be paid and
what do you do with it?

134
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,820
And the legal market isn't big enough,
um,

135
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,520
to accommodate all this stuff that's
grown.

136
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,790
And so there's sort of still,
you know,

137
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,790
kind of a black market that goes on.
And He,

138
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,360
he,
he describes this.

139
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,170
And,
uh,

140
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,190
but even before that,
it's just a fascinating book about,

141
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,620
you know,
all the different things that he learned

142
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,040
in the course of his career about how to
get it,

143
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,060
you know,
um,

144
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,100
do the job and not get caught.

145
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,660
Had A,
had a rig,

146
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:35,830
a load at to drive cross country.
How do you do a dummy car?

147
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,840
Um,
you know,

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,080
he tells a story about how basically you
want four cars,

149
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,940
you want the guy in the front seat to
be,

150
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,750
to be,
to look like a drug dealer,

151
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,890
have a terrible record,
drive badly,

152
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,250
uh,
basically to attract the police.

153
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,280
Uh,
and the,

154
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,200
you know,
the third car is the load car,

155
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,970
the second car sort of watching to see
if there's,

156
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,420
there's cops in either direction.
And then the fourth car is basically

157
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:04,000
driving up,
uh,

158
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,360
behind the load card to sort of prevent
anybody from seeing the license plate

159
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,360
and that sort of thing.
And so he just talks about all this

160
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:12,140
stuff and it's,
it's,

161
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,490
it's fascinating.
And,

162
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:16,190
um,
it was a new kind of writing for me

163
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,820
because I'd never really done anything
except straight journalism and we sort

164
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,290
of had to do it in narrative form.

165
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,570
And so we're,
we're putting it out serially online

166
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,830
right now,
which is really cool.

167
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,980
So you did one of those change the names
to protect the innocent.

168
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,050
Exactly,
yeah,

169
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,730
yeah.
Or,

170
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,630
or the guilty.
Yeah,

171
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,483
yeah,
yeah.

172
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,670
But for the most part based on facts,
yes,

173
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,230
yes.
The situations where let's just say

174
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,730
realistic,
you know?

175
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

176
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,310
And,
and his,

177
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,250
you know,
the observations were that,

178
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,650
uh,
that he describes are all,

179
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,780
you know,
things that he actually learned.

180
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:51,920
The situations were,
you know,

181
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,230
relatively close to things that actually
happened.

182
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:55,910
So yeah.
That's interesting.

183
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,100
So that's available now.
Yup.

184
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,851
Yup.
Again,

185
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,800
it's uh,
uh,

186
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,080
business secrets of drug dealing.com.
It's,

187
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,540
it's the kind of a new thing.
Aye.

188
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,420
I,
I,

189
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,420
I grew up,
I'm a huge fan of a serialized,

190
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,620
uh,
detective stories.

191
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,960
I was a big fan of like Dashiell
Hammett,

192
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,520
Raymond Chandler,
and I loved a black mask magazine,

193
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,930
which was the big pulp,
new our magazine and the twenties and

194
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:23,930
thirties.

195
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,400
And,
um,

196
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,230
you know,
I grew up reading all those stories and

197
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,090
I always,
uh,

198
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,170
it was in the back of my mind always
that I wanted to try this a and write a

199
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:34,940
book,
uh,

200
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,020
on a deadline.
So I'm doing this now.

201
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,120
It's a,
it's basically co written with this,

202
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,420
uh,
anonymous character who can appear with

203
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,370
me on shows like this anywhere because
he asks he's,

204
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,310
he's still not captured.
And,

205
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:50,780
um,
so it was their,

206
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:52,670
their warrants out for this guy.
No,

207
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:56,180
he's never been picked up and arrested.
Never been arrested?

208
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,590
Nope.
Oh yeah.

209
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,450
Uh,
it's like a smart dude.

210
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,210
He is a smart dude.
He has a smart dude and some of his

211
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:06,890
employers would be very surprised to
know that he's got a hobby like this.

212
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,200
Um,
uh,

213
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:09,960
it's funny.
I,

214
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,970
you know,
I knew him again.

215
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:13,790
I knew him for years and didn't have the
faintest clue,

216
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,950
uh,
that,

217
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,820
that this was,
this was going on.

218
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,090
So keep a job in order to avoid
suspicion.

219
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,150
So the book is actually structured with
all these rules.

220
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,740
It's chapter has,
has rules.

221
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:30,680
And at one of his,
his most important rules is always have

222
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,360
a job.
Uh,

223
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,660
and he,
it's for a number of reasons.

224
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,000
Number one,
um,

225
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,890
he talks about how when he was young,
he worked at places like,

226
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,730
you know,
Merriot or applebee's and he's like,

227
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,170
you know,
if you can serve,

228
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,280
um,
have the patients to serve people at an

229
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,680
apple bees and not blow up and scream
people,

230
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,890
then you won't screw up a package like
that.

231
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,740
In other words,
if you can have the self discipline to

232
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:05,790
actually get through one of these jobs
and not blow up and be crazy,

233
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,520
then you're going to handle or hinder
yourself well at a car stop.

234
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,220
That's fascinating.
So he used it almost like as a

235
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,300
discipline exercise.

236
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,080
He used it as a discipline exercise.
He learned among other things like,

237
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,870
uh,
another one for his rules,

238
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:21,120
his dress like an off duty is apple
piece waiter,

239
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,740
right?
Like,

240
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,080
do not dress.
Uh,

241
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,870
and he talks about this,
about how most dealers,

242
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,450
um,
they learn their,

243
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,470
their,
uh,

244
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,020
profession,
uh,

245
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,150
by watching movies.
You know,

246
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,830
there's no,
there's no book out there.

247
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:40,200
I mean,
it's not like this generation is growing

248
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:44,430
up reading like new the old iceberg slam
or Donald Goines novels or whatever it

249
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,420
is.
They're watching,

250
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:50,340
you know,
the wire or blow a or ozar canal or

251
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,040
whatever it is.
Um,

252
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,020
but dealers very often dress like
dealers.

253
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:56,610
You can,
you can kind of spot them,

254
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,260
you know,
and he says,

255
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:00,570
that's exactly the opposite of what you
have to do.

256
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,040
Um,
you know,

257
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,700
where sperry shoes were boring clothes
look like,

258
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,534
you know,
you've,

259
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,310
you're on your way to,
to,

260
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,460
you know,
your freshman English class or whatever

261
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:12,294
it is.

262
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,790
Um,
and you know,

263
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:19,020
sad sound like a nerdy college kid when,
when,

264
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:22,200
uh,
the cops pull you over and all this

265
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:24,690
stuff is a,
is sort of central to his,

266
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,650
his whole a worldview about how to avoid
getting caught.

267
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,290
Wow.
That would be a great book.

268
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,490
[inaudible] I mean,
it is,

269
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:32,851
it's,
it's,

270
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:35,180
it's really fun.
And you know,

271
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:36,390
the,
the fact that,

272
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,000
um,
that the,

273
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,390
you know,
the coauthor is actually a person who's

274
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,430
pulling this off makes it,
makes it really interesting and it makes

275
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:46,560
it a,
a real challenge to write it too,

276
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:48,690
because,
um,

277
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,070
you know,
I had to kind of,

278
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,790
uh,
simulate his voice,

279
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,630
uh,
and kind of communicate to people what,

280
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,800
what those situations were like and what
things look like from his point of view.

281
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,830
And obviously I'm white and he's African
American and that's,

282
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,850
that's tough.
And,

283
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:06,980
uh,
but you know,

284
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,970
I think it works,
it's kind of a cool story,

285
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,520
but it must've been a juicy,
like when you found the subject and just

286
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,510
felt like,
oh boy,

287
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,620
we got something here.

288
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,480
Oh yes.
Super Juicy.

289
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,021
Yeah,
no,

290
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:16,711
it's,
it's,

291
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:19,020
it's so much fun.
I haven't had this much fun,

292
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,120
like fun,
fun writing anything for,

293
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:23,790
for a long time because,
um,

294
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,600
you know,
most,

295
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,310
most criminal memoirs,
and again,

296
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,090
I grew up a junkie in terms of reading
the stuff I love.

297
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,450
I love books that are written after the
fact by people who were in crime.

298
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:38,100
You know,
like pappy on was one of my favorite

299
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:39,210
books growing up.
I mean,

300
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,610
it's a,
it's an amazing story about not,

301
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:44,730
not just crime,
but about prison and what's that like,

302
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,430
but they're always written by people
after they got caught.

303
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,400
Right.
And so there's never that book by the

304
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:53,470
person who's still out there,
uh,

305
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,290
and,
and talking about what al all life was

306
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,180
like,
um,

307
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,610
successfully,
uh,

308
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,890
still on the other side of the law.
And that,

309
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,260
that part of it is fascinating.

310
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,550
It's just a,
it's a completely new thing.

311
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,940
And,
and he has all these insights that I,

312
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,760
that I would never have thought about.
Like he,

313
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:14,800
he talks about how,
um,

314
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,340
there's a thing he calls the hood price.
Like if you,

315
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,470
when you're dealing,
uh,

316
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,590
selling to,
um,

317
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,180
uh,
in black neighborhoods even he charges a

318
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,220
higher price.
Uh,

319
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,210
because there's more,
there are more problems that you

320
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:35,400
inevitably run into when you're dealing
in those neighborhoods because there's

321
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,150
more cops,
which means more lawyers,

322
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:40,090
which means more security,
which means more attention to detail

323
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,530
when you deal to the rich white kids
just as nobody is paying attention.

324
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,600
So you just,
there's less overhead,

325
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,860
you know,
in the business.

326
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,600
Uh,
which is,

327
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,100
which is fascinating.
It's,

328
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,750
it's a,
and you know,

329
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,010
he talks to all about this and,
and he,

330
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,750
he has,
he spent a lifetime kind of just keeping

331
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,720
all this stuff in his head,
always wanting to,

332
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,110
to put it down and he just got to be too
much.

333
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,270
And he just sort of tapped me on the
shoulder one day and said,

334
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,950
can we have lunch?
I just want to talk to you about

335
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:09,784
something.

336
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,730
Do you know him before this?
I would say three years.

337
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,860
Four years.
Yeah.

338
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,220
We had a trust.
You well,

339
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:24,150
I'm glad we decided to not have him on
because he would get busted.

340
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,433
Yeah,
exactly.

341
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,680
They had talked to him.
Yeah.

342
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,810
Like you can't,
like if you were on something and you

343
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:31,890
had a mask on,
people go,

344
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,970
that's mad tie,
eat.

345
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,570
You know what I mean?
There'd be somebody listening to him.

346
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:38,750
He does.
Maybe he doesn't understand that there's

347
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,150
millions of people listening.
I totally agree with you.

348
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:45,240
Words of those people would go,
that's whatever,

349
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,991
right.
It's Mike.

350
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,040
That's John.
Whatever his name is.

351
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,600
They would get it.
Even the,

352
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:51,600
even the unabomber got caught and he
only talked to like two people,

353
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,970
you know,
especially today with this jeff

354
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:56,040
sessions,
mother fucker and Oh my God,

355
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,830
place.
He's scary.

356
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,230
You just see the shit that he's saying
now that they're going to actively

357
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:05,130
separate parents from their children if
they catch illegals coming over with

358
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:08,320
their families.
I mean that's just been dictative and

359
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,590
evil.
Yeah,

360
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,420
no,
and it's funny,

361
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:16,421
I covered trump obviously one on,
on the campaign trail and I watched,

362
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,960
uh,
the sort of the progression of his

363
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,710
thought,
uh,

364
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,300
or non thought as a,
as,

365
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,730
as it is,
uh,

366
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,650
on,
on things like immigration.

367
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,070
And it seemed to me that he could,
and very quickly that people just want

368
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:36,560
to be mean to inward immigrants.
He just,

369
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,570
it's not so much about the policy.
He was very nonspecific about that

370
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:44,510
whenever he could be.
He just wanted to say things that,

371
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,410
that,
that um,

372
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,590
feel vindictive and cruel and nasty.
And so doing something to is just,

373
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,000
it's just monstrous,
you know?

374
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:55,460
But SEF sessions is a real creep.
Oh,

375
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,320
he's horrible.
He's a scary guy.

376
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,930
Like,
one of the things that he said is good

377
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:03,620
people don't smoke marijuana.
Just saying that alone.

378
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,490
Do you know how many grandmas out there
with cancer are smoking marijuana?

379
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,301
Of course,
you know,

380
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,330
fuck you.
Right.

381
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,960
Crazy asshole.
Is the fact that someone could be in

382
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,600
such a position of influence and say
something like that.

383
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,790
Right?
Like this isn't just your dad saying

384
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,700
that good people don't smoke marijuana.
He goes out in the yard and fucking

385
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,440
smokes a cigarette.
This is,

386
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,060
this is the attorney general.
Yeah,

387
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,080
exactly.
They're fine.

388
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,791
Yeah.
And,

389
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,340
and you know,
when you take ignorance and then the

390
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:31,820
full weight of the executive branch,
um,

391
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,720
Eh,
you know,

392
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,450
especially the d,
the anti-drug apparatus,

393
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,920
you know,
that's,

394
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,380
that's a terrible,
terrible combination with it.

395
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,950
And it's too bad because I think,
I think even the law enforcement

396
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:44,930
community was kind of coming around on
this.

397
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,020
Yes.
Um,

398
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,060
you know,
they,

399
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,000
they don't want to be picking up people
for dealing weed.

400
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:53,660
I mean,
I talked to from my last book about the

401
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,650
Eric Garner case,
I talked to lots of cops and they,

402
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,650
they just hate having to do that.

403
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,191
You know,
those,

404
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,900
those buses are not fun for them.
Well,

405
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,390
the Eric Gardner case was the guy who
got choked in New York,

406
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:02,781
right?
Yeah,

407
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:03,920
exactly.
Cigarettes,

408
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,600
which has even even more than doubles.
Yeah.

409
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.
And that's,

410
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,790
and you know,
cops having to do that,

411
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,620
that's not even a misdemeanor in New
York.

412
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:13,454
And you know,
if you gotta,

413
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,580
if you got to drag somebody in for
selling a 50 cents cigarette,

414
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,470
you know,
that's not exactly serpico.

415
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:19,610
You know what I mean?
Like again,

416
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,340
a cops don't,
you don't join the force dreaming of

417
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:23,540
doing that.
So,

418
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,620
but uh,
yeah,

419
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,020
I mean the sessions thing is terrible.
Yeah.

420
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:30,800
Having that guy in that kind of a
position and saying things like,

421
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,430
good people don't smoke marijuana or,
you know,

422
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,270
when families come across the border
illegally,

423
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,980
we're going to separate the parents from
the children.

424
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,870
Like,
the fuck is wrong with you.

425
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,310
And then you throw in a good dose of the
Jesus Jesus.

426
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,170
Yeah,
exactly.

427
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,310
Scary fucking time.
At least trump has said that he's going

428
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:51,830
to,
he's not going to support sessions on

429
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,970
going after marijuana in states where
it's legal is going to leave the states

430
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,710
to take care of it themselves.
That's encouraging the,

431
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:00,110
the,
the,

432
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,040
the problem with Donald Trump and,
and this is something that I didn't clue

433
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,640
into until I'd spent a lot of time
watching the guy and following them

434
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:10,700
around,
is that he can sound like he believes

435
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:15,701
something very deeply and you can be
absolutely convinced that he even,

436
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,530
uh,
logically thanks,

437
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:22,280
thanks a thing.
But he'll have a meeting with somebody

438
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,830
and five minutes later I'll have a
completely the opposite opinion.

439
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:30,831
So I have no confidence that Donald
Trump will anything that he says that

440
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,290
he,
that it will stay his opinion on

441
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,780
anything.
He can be convinced to go through a

442
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:39,080
complete one 80 on basically any issue,
which is scary,

443
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,340
isn't he in some ways the perfect
representative of America because of

444
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:44,450
that.
Absolutely.

445
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,010
He has no attention span.
And,

446
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,170
and,
and I talked about this when,

447
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,010
when I was covering him because people
said,

448
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,441
oh,
what,

449
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:53,580
what is this billionaire in New York or
have in common with,

450
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,690
with an ordinary Americans?
He has a lot in common with them.

451
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,180
He has exactly the same media habits
that they have.

452
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:02,220
He reads the same dumb shit on the
Internet.

453
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,940
Um,
he has the same total inability to

454
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,790
separate fact from fiction.
Uh,

455
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,880
he's completely credulous when he reads
a news item about something that he

456
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:16,540
personally agrees with,
uh,

457
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,440
and he'll,
he'll tweet it out five seconds later

458
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:22,650
before he checks it out,
which is like what every other American

459
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:23,071
does.
You know,

460
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:25,410
they get something on facebook and they
immediately share it with,

461
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:26,610
you know,
all their friends.

462
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,380
Um,
and this is a,

463
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:32,050
this is an American thing now.
And just the total inability to,

464
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,770
to logically look at things,
I don't know.

465
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,550
Yeah.
And the short attention span too,

466
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,880
short attention span,
drifting in and out of conversations,

467
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,720
not being able to pay attention to memos
unless his name is in there.

468
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,920
Oh,
a hundred times.

469
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:47,040
Yeah,
exactly.

470
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,231
People,
I know.

471
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:49,160
It sounds like American.

472
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,871
Right,
right.

473
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:51,010
And,
and you know,

474
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,170
it's,
it's funny because if you,

475
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,100
if you watch trump speeches are actually
better or better yet,

476
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,760
if you read trump's speeches,
it's,

477
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,200
they would pass out,
um,

478
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,880
the text of what trump was supposed to
say,

479
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,190
uh,
before his events.

480
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,550
And so I'd be sitting there,
I'd be looking at the,

481
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,760
the,
the remarks,

482
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:12,340
and they would be cogent from one end to
the other.

483
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,220
Then he would get up there and the first
line we'd be like,

484
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,810
oh,
it's so great to be back in Manchester,

485
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:18,130
New Hampshire.
I always loved,

486
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
you know,
being here.

487
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,230
And that would be right.
And then he would veer off and he would,

488
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:28,530
he would start saying one thing and then
the other thing and his thoughts would

489
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,250
drift and all these different
directions.

490
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:34,840
And then when you looked at the actual
transcript of what Donald Trump had

491
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,800
said,
he not only wasn't completing thoughts,

492
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:42,520
he wasn't completing sentences.
He talks in these sort of strange

493
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:44,230
fragments.
Uh,

494
00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:47,800
and he'll,
he'll drift from one idea to another and

495
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,200
they won't have any logical connection
to each other.

496
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,480
And people still responded to it,
which tells you something both about him

497
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:57,070
and about his audience.
Right.

498
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:02,071
Because they're on the same weird mental
wave length where we're just sort of

499
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:07,651
disconnected bits of of emotion and
thought is enough now.

500
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,550
Right.
Isn't that weird?

501
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:11,460
I mean that is where it's really strong.
Strange.

502
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,040
Well,
people don't know that someone's not

503
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,930
smart if they're dumber than the person.
Right,

504
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,670
right.
Yeah.

505
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,670
I think what it's revealing is what a
small amount of time most people spend

506
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:26,640
actually thinking,
thinking about ideas,

507
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:29,820
thinking about themselves,
thinking about behavior,

508
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:33,660
thinking about the impact that someone
who's in the position of president can

509
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:36,300
have.
Very few people are out there actually

510
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,190
thinking.
Yeah,

511
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,930
I mean relatively a pretty large number
overall,

512
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:43,230
but very few in terms of percentages,
in terms of the people that you can

513
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:45,750
reach and the people that will show up
at his press rallies.

514
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:47,010
That's a big thing too.
Right?

515
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,070
Who the fuck

516
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,700
is going to go to a campaign speech for
anybody unless you're a journalist.

517
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,050
Well that's,
that's interesting because I've,

518
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,580
I've been to a million campaign rallies,
right.

519
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,060
And,
and my opinion on them is,

520
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,240
you know,
I would rather basically stick a

521
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:08,670
railroad spike in my ear then then
voluntarily go to one of these things.

522
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,880
Um,
and not,

523
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,060
you know,
not be paid to do it because normally a

524
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:18,061
campaign speeches like this
supernaturally boring experience where a

525
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:23,251
guy or you know,
a woman stands up there and reads out a

526
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,310
preselected,
a market tested list of political

527
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:29,700
cliches that,
um,

528
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,010
have no meaning whatsoever and that,
you know,

529
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,500
don't represent what they're actually
going to do in,

530
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,190
in when there are an office.
Anyway.

531
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,510
Um,
so,

532
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,380
and if you have to listen to that 40 or
50 times in a row,

533
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,080
which is what happens when you're
covering campaigns,

534
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,250
like you want to kill yourself.

535
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,120
So why anyone would go voluntarily to,
to,

536
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,670
to see that as entertainment is sort of
beyond me.

537
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:56,671
But that happened in,
in 2015 and 2016 trumps events were a

538
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:59,380
little different.
They were,

539
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,020
um,
they were a little bit,

540
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,710
and I think he got a little bit of this
from his wwe experience.

541
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:08,170
Like he turned them into these kind of
menacing,

542
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,080
weird,
uh,

543
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,660
audience participation,
uh,

544
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:18,661
things where he would have the audience
turn on the press and shout at us and

545
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:20,860
throw things.
And,

546
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:21,694
you know,
we,

547
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,100
because we're always standing up on
those risers,

548
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,380
uh,
and we have ropes around us.

549
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:30,160
We look like zoo animals or something.
And,

550
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,710
uh,
and we were the representatives and they

551
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,420
hated the lead,
you know,

552
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,060
and,
and he'll it,

553
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,380
and he turned it into this sort of like,
physical,

554
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,750
menacing,
intimate thing.

555
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,093
And,
you know,

556
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,390
people would come from all over.

557
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,040
They'd come from down the hills,
you know,

558
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,920
and drive 50 miles to,
to,

559
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
to see the spectacle.
It was,

560
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,280
it was fascinating to watch,
but kind of terrifying too.

561
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,221
Well,
the peep.

562
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:53,920
Yeah.
The people that are going to those

563
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:54,530
things,
like,

564
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,310
boy,
that has an odd group of humans that

565
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:59,590
have decided this is how you're going to
spend your day.

566
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:03,400
You're going to go watch this guy rabble
about fake news,

567
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,320
right.
He's going to ramble about this.

568
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:07,300
You're fake news and point.
The CNN guy,

569
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,980
you're a fake news.
Oh yeah,

570
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,360
yeah.
Fake News.

571
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,830
CNN.
Terrible,

572
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,820
terrible rating.
And people like this Yas,

573
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,140
they wave the flag,
keep going,

574
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,010
say things that make me feel good,
say things that excite me.

575
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,960
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

576
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,320
And Yeah.
You know,

577
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,620
look at these blood suckers.
That was a line that he,

578
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,260
that he used to pull out a lot.
Look at these bloodsuckers,

579
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,450
these people reporting information.

580
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,740
Yeah.
We speak again,

581
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:35,610
we'd be sitting there and a whole bunch
of reporters and we're,

582
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,930
we're a bunch of geeks and aero shirts.
You know,

583
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,800
we got the,
we got pads and we're kind of looked

584
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,310
very surrounded by,
you know,

585
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:45,710
in some cases,
15,000 people who,

586
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,990
you know,
are kind of turning in our direction.

587
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
And um,
you know,

588
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,190
in a couple of cases at it,
you know,

589
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,650
there were,
it was definitely up in the air whether

590
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:58,160
this was going to turn ugly or,
and in a few places that did turn ugly

591
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,420
and,
and um,

592
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,361
but he,
he,

593
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:04,100
he was very clued in.
The one thing I will say about trump is

594
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:07,640
that he has a,
a keen instinct for audience.

595
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,760
He knows where they are.
He knows what their mood is.

596
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:12,760
He knows what he has to do to get them,

597
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,770
um,
you know,

598
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:15,900
to wake them up,
uh,

599
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,250
to,
to stir them up.

600
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:20,400
He can tell when he's losing them.
Um,

601
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,211
uh,
I mean that,

602
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,460
that is,
that is one talent that he does have.

603
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,810
Uh,
but it's,

604
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,440
it's a negative talent for sure.
Well,

605
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,700
he uses it certainly in a negative way.
Yeah,

606
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,070
absolutely.
Um,

607
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,150
w how much attention have you paid it
all to his use of diet pills had been

608
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:37,320
following that at all.
No,

609
00:24:37,321 --> 00:24:39,120
that's fascinating.
What is he using?

610
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:42,090
A lot of diet pills.
I'm so glad I could talk to matt tight.

611
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,600
This is great.
What was the reporter was at Washington

612
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:50,280
Post that first talked about it.
They found the Duane Reed pharmacy where

613
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:55,281
he was first prescribed diet pills by
this doctor who described it for a

614
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,650
nonexistent condition,
like metabolic deficiency or some shit

615
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:04,050
like metabolic disorder,
I think he called it,

616
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,690
and it allowed him to prescribe in.

617
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,600
This guy was like a known prescriber of
these things,

618
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,440
like a doctor feel a good time and he's
got it.

619
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:14,670
He's got you covered.
Yay.

620
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,690
Metabolic disease.
So Matt,

621
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,290
you're gonna feel peppy all day and he's
supposed to be on these for a very short

622
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,390
amount of time.
He was on them for a long period of

623
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:26,400
time.
And I'm this guy,

624
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,890
this reporter to printed out,
tweeted out the actual Duane Reed

625
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:34,980
pharmacy where trump was filling this
prescription.

626
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,240
And then now they,
they're saying that he's on some other

627
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:42,750
diet pill,
which is one of the ingredients that was

628
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,240
in phen.
Phen do you remember Phen Phen Oh,

629
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:47,910
absolutely.
Unfortunately I know.

630
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:48,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

631
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:52,140
Phen phen was something for,
people don't know that the young folks

632
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:55,200
out there,
there was a pill that people were taking

633
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,230
in the 1990s and I knew a gal who was a
very pretty girl,

634
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,630
but she was large and she got on the fen
phen and I hadn't seen her in like,

635
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:07,500
I dunno,
like six months or something.

636
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,050
And I saw her and all of a sudden she
was like 120 pounds.

637
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:11,340
So I was like,
what?

638
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,440
You look amazing.
Like what are you doing?

639
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,710
Like you exercise and it's not that,
did you go crazy and join a gym?

640
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:17,580
And he's like,
no.

641
00:26:17,581 --> 00:26:20,040
I started taking this stuff called phen
phen and she'd be like,

642
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:22,980
Blah Blah Blah.
Couldn't stop talking and grinding his

643
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,220
teeth a little bit,
non speed and she started having weird

644
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:29,220
feelings with her heart.
So she stopped it and it turns out

645
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,070
people are just dropping dead left and
right off of this stuff.

646
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:34,790
I'm going to give you a fucking heart
attacks and all kinds of shit is

647
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,280
hardcore stuff.
But they recognize that the combination

648
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:41,460
of these two things was the issue.
But one of these things by themselves

649
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:42,294
is,
okay,

650
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,560
so this one by itself is what they think
he's on now,

651
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,970
which makes sense that a guy who's in
his seventies has so much energy.

652
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,170
I mean they say he's up at five o'clock
in the morning watching Fox News and

653
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:57,660
then he starts tweeting like a five 30
in the morning.

654
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:00,180
He's tweeting and gets very little
sleep.

655
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:03,060
You drinks like 12 diet cokes a day.
I mean the guy's just,

656
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,720
he's got boundless energy.
Like when he was campaigning,

657
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,940
that was the thing that was so stunning
to me.

658
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,010
I was like,
I know what it's like to go on the road

659
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:14,070
and just do stand up.
Just to stand up where you have your

660
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:15,000
act.
You fuck around.

661
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,040
It's fun.
You have a good time is fucking,

662
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,320
whereas you add after a couple of days,
oh yeah.

663
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,380
One town and the next town.
By the time that third day rolls around,

664
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:26,100
you're fucking beat down.
This guy was doing day after day after

665
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:27,760
day after day.
And he's like,

666
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:29,730
good.
It's all great to see all you wonderful

667
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,420
people.

668
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,960
We're going to make America great again.
The wall got 10 feet higher and

669
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,100
everything is with energy.
And,

670
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,610
and this is the speculation,
the speculation.

671
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:39,930
Is he like,
I mean,

672
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:42,840
I'm sure you're aware many,
many journalists are on adderall,

673
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,030
right?
He's on something.

674
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,901
Sure.
Yeah.

675
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:46,681
No,
of course.

676
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:50,280
This is in my,
like the way I look at it,

677
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:53,250
it's like this is indicative of where
America stands today.

678
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,250
It's not just that he's a good
representative of mayor because he has

679
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:58,740
the same media consumption habits and
the same,

680
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,420
uh,
inability to read books and all these

681
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:03,810
different variables,
but also because he's pilled up,

682
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,730
right?
Which is everybody in America,

683
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,930
everybody in America,
right?

684
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,903
I mean,
that's

685
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,240
like there,
there's,

686
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,380
there's a little bit of a precedent
there because,

687
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:13,670
um,
uh,

688
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,610
you know,
Kennedy had so many physical problems

689
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,350
that,
uh,

690
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,420
I'm not sure if you remember,
there was a book that dark side of

691
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:22,670
camelot that came and came out by Sy
Hersh,

692
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,290
uh,
where,

693
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,170
uh,
it talked about how Kennedy in the

694
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,020
morning used to have an s a secret
service agent give him,

695
00:28:30,021 --> 00:28:33,200
uh,
a shot of basically amphetamines every,

696
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:35,840
every morning.
And he would sort of pace around the

697
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:38,390
oval office talking about who we wanted
to whack today.

698
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:39,410
You know,
this,

699
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,220
this was like the background for Bay of
Pigs and you know,

700
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,070
all these other things.
Um,

701
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,650
so it's very dangerous when a president
is,

702
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,580
is,
you know,

703
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,950
pharmaceutically altered when a person
who,

704
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,780
uh,
is,

705
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,650
you know,
if he's,

706
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,020
if he's on speed and he's tweeting
threats to a nuclear power,

707
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,370
like a,
I mean that would be a very ironic and

708
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,920
uh,
but terrible way for all of it.

709
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,110
All of that,
all of us to end

710
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,110
find the tweet I've been looking for.
It was hard to find the first time.

711
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,660
I know who wrote it,
but I can't you gotta you gotta save

712
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:15,240
that and put it in your favorites cause
we talked about it so many times.

713
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:20,620
You got to figure out a way to save that
and put it in a bookmark because it was

714
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,940
in like he had the Duane Reed pharmacy
and then there's the speculation about

715
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:29,670
what the most recent stuff is that he's
on,

716
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:32,460
which is again,
one ingredient in fen phen.

717
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:36,420
But one of the things that they were
saying is that when you look at the side

718
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:41,421
effects of this stuff,
one of the side effects is a delusional

719
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,930
of reality.
Delusions of grandeur,

720
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,330
of course,
aggression,

721
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:49,210
impulsiveness,
like all these things that we associate

722
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:51,010
with Donald Trump.
Like we,

723
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,140
we don't even know who he is.
We know.

724
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,480
We know who he is.
Pilled up if this guy's right,

725
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,850
which is fucking fascinating.
He might be dealing with essentially a

726
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:05,851
pharmaceutical intervention into not
just American lives in terms of

727
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:10,300
individuals,
but in terms of the way policy is driven

728
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,800
and the way the country moves forward.
It might literally be pharmaceutically

729
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,800
enhanced,
that's very Philip k Dick,

730
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:20,140
but it could easily be true,
could easily be true.

731
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,120
It all seems true.
It seems like,

732
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,930
like I'm not saying anything that's
outland as first of all not,

733
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,820
we're talking about something that's
real pills.

734
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,680
These pills are real.
We're talking about something that's

735
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:31,990
widely consumed.
Everybody knows this and we're talking

736
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:34,450
about a guy who was an extraordinary,
extraordinary amount of energy for

737
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:38,350
somebody who doesn't work dirt work out,
rather doesn't eat healthy.

738
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,620
Right.
And like what?

739
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:40,720
Where's he getting on his energy?

740
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,171
Yeah.
No,

741
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,750
I mean,
I remember talking about this with some

742
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:47,120
of the other reporters because
as you say,

743
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,360
the campaign trail is incredibly
grueling.

744
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,350
There's a reason why some candidates
can't do it.

745
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,210
Um,
or,

746
00:30:55,211 --> 00:31:00,211
or they opt to do lots of legacy media
appearances or ad buys.

747
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,700
They,
they travel less than a pure more.

748
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,390
The people who tend to succeed are the
ones who can do three or four

749
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:10,330
appearances a day,
fly to three different cities a day.

750
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,640
Um,
and they,

751
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,130
most of those people are either health
freaks,

752
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,210
people who are,
you know,

753
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,210
in good physical condition.
Obama was,

754
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,490
was definitely one of those people who,
who,

755
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,370
you know,
had to have a run at some point or else

756
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:27,610
he couldn't do that schedule.
But Donald Trump,

757
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,260
you know,
you look at him and it's kind of

758
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,400
history.
There it is.

759
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,570
There it is.
Fun fact,

760
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:34,510
in 19 to trump started taking
amphetamine derivatives,

761
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,390
abused them,
only supposed to take two for 25 days,

762
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,460
stayed on for eight years.
Really?

763
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,840
And this is Kurt [inaudible] White House
submit,

764
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,490
uh,
admitted it to me,

765
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,580
uh,
said only a short time for diet in

766
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:52,120
quotes when he was not overweight.
I countered with medical records.

767
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:55,960
They cut me off.
People misreading drug was dye,

768
00:31:55,961 --> 00:32:00,961
ethyl [inaudible] 75 milligrams a day
prescription filled at Duane reed on

769
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:03,010
57th street in Manhattan.
Oh,

770
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:04,300
I know.
I know things,

771
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,250
doctor who,
uh,

772
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:11,251
wrote prescription Dr. Joseph Greenberg
diagnosed him with metabolic imbalance,

773
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,170
which we have never heard about.
Again.

774
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,370
Greenberg was later publicly slammed as
someone who provided uppers to rich

775
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:21,610
people in Manhattan,
a metabolic imbalance in quotes.

776
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,340
Uh,
if true could be electrolyte

777
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:28,480
insufficiencies anaerobic and bounces
acid and bounces and an assortment of

778
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:31,450
related disorders that can have serious
health consequences.

779
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,980
Yet his other doctor,
Dr Harold Bornstein said he had been

780
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:40,981
trump's doctors since 1980 and it never
mentioned the metabolic imbalance found

781
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,100
by Greenburg.
Yeah,

782
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,250
right,
right.

783
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,550
So save that,
save that in book.

784
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:53,810
Barkat now find out what the other
stuff,

785
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:58,811
cause he was in just to just google
trump is on one of the ingredients in

786
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,370
phen.
Phen so I googled that.

787
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:03,920
That came up and like a gawker article,
excuse me.

788
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:08,540
Gawker Gawker are call Walker from 2016
that said he was on fincher,

789
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,040
but at the actual name of venture mean
or,

790
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,430
yeah.
Um,

791
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,890
so this is what they think he's on now.
Fincher mean yes.

792
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,960
Which is also a stimulant,
which just makes sense.

793
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:20,570
If that guy's telling the truth of Kurt
icon wall is telling the truth,

794
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,190
that means that he was on pills,
amphetamines for eight years,

795
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:30,250
which means he is having good results.
So if he was looking at this room or a

796
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:33,950
doctor prescribes Donald Trump cheap
speed,

797
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,080
and this is a Ashley,
what is her name?

798
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,940
Ashley Fineburg.
Ashley Fineberg.

799
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,830
Who is a really good reporter.
Well,

800
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,640
I'm sure she's right.
It makes fucking makes sense.

801
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:45,170
Absolutely.
It makes sense.

802
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
Absolutely.
I mean everybody,

803
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,630
you know,
I don't know how a person whose diet is

804
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,370
cheeseburgers and that coke could run
for president

805
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,780
without tried chicken with a fork and
knife.

806
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,690
Weirdo.
See that?

807
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,690
No,
I've never seen that on the trump jet

808
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,290
eaten fried chicken with a fork and
knife alone.

809
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,420
She'd be like,
who are you fucking alien in a trump

810
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:13,090
suit?
So I wouldn't know that because they

811
00:34:13,091 --> 00:34:14,950
keep the press in a separate plane.
Oh yeah,

812
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:15,860
there you go.
That is,

813
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,590
oh my God,
look at the bucket.

814
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,540
Yeah.
Eating fried chicken with a fork and

815
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:20,374
knife.

816
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,400
See,
that's bad.

817
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,280
I mean,
I think I would think ordinary America

818
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:26,940
would,
would dig him for that because let's use

819
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,540
your fingers.
Fingers.

820
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,650
Just put your face in it

821
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,610
if you have to.
Yeah.

822
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,890
You doing man?
Yeah.

823
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,020
Fork and knife.
Fried Chicken.

824
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:37,980
You got him elitist.
Amazing.

825
00:34:37,981 --> 00:34:38,970
Phen phen was that,

826
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,070
well,
even the,

827
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,960
um,
was the name of the very cheap speed

828
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:47,060
that used to be imported when I lived in
Russia,

829
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:47,930
they,
there was,

830
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:50,600
there was a type of speed that used to
come from the Baltics,

831
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,510
um,
that allegedly,

832
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,910
uh,
you know,

833
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,600
the,
the urban legend was,

834
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:01,630
was that the Nazis had all their
soldiers on a cheap speed for the long

835
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:05,390
marches going into,
into Russia.

836
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:07,070
And they set up these,
uh,

837
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,590
these pharmaceutical plants,
uh,

838
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,390
and theory.
And again,

839
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,610
the street legend was that,
that was what this drug was,

840
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,290
but they called it fen.
So,

841
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:15,960
uh,
wasn't

842
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,960
that the original,
the origins of methamphetamines wasn't

843
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:25,110
methamphetamines created by the Nazis?
I believe it was.

844
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:29,820
And I think this is one of the
speculations as to why they could get

845
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:33,900
suicide bombers.
The kamikazes to slam their jets into

846
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,370
aircraft carriers,
loaded them up on math up.

847
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,170
Right.
Well we have those go pills.

848
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,480
Right?
That's what they're called.

849
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:42,960
Is it?
Well,

850
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,910
that's awesome.
Yeah,

851
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,350
there's definitely some speed that gets
prescribed and steroids right.

852
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:50,130
Also to soldiers.
Um,

853
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,990
and maybe talk to people that have been
in,

854
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,441
you know,
they'll,

855
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:56,460
they'll tell you about what different
things that they allow them to take and

856
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:58,590
gave them to take.
But um,

857
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,260
that modafinil stuff is,
um,

858
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,750
that's really common.
And then I know,

859
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:07,230
I know a lot of fighter pilot or pilots
we'll take that keeps you from getting

860
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,330
sleepy,
keeps you alert and awake.

861
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:11,580
And that was also something Hillary
Clinton was supposed to be on.

862
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,900
Really?
Yeah.

863
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:15,360
She was supposed to be on Modafinil.
That was one of the things that she

864
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:16,660
admitted to.
Um,

865
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,960
and it's legal and it's done.
It's a weird,

866
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:21,120
if you've tried that now,
it's a weird one.

867
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,270
It doesn't speed you up in terms of like
heart rate.

868
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:26,460
It's not like,
like drinking five cups of coffee,

869
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,520
but it does give you this weird sense of
alertness like,

870
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,920
oh,
fucking really awake.

871
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,990
That sounds kind of good.
It's kind of good.

872
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,790
Yeah.
I have a buddy of mine who's a writer

873
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:36,624
who,
uh,

874
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,200
he's got some health issues and he,
he's on it all the time and he said,

875
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:41,310
if I don't take it,
I'm a mess.

876
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:42,390
I just really,
yeah.

877
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,030
Well,
I mean a slim,

878
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,040
it sounds,
sounds perfect for writers.

879
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:52,041
So look at that photo and add,
stay fit and slim by,

880
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,090
by taking him fed.
I mean,

881
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,610
look at her.

882
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:57,000
She looks happy.
She looks really happy.

883
00:36:57,001 --> 00:37:01,080
Super happy.
Now they should have the next day

884
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:03,810
picture how she's dead.
Dead for decades.

885
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:05,640
He died a day after they took that
picture.

886
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,290
What does this one tons of them more
dean.

887
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,500
She can now she can cook breakfast
again.

888
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,810
When you prescribed new Morn Dean
Morton,

889
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,550
Morton and dean worn a dean.
What is more than a deed?

890
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:23,010
It's you take it in the morning,
you wakes you up.

891
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,170
Well,
she can make breakfast again.

892
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,170
Thanks honey.
If I keep bouncing off the world.

893
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,910
Yeah.
She's going to put a line on the,

894
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,130
on that spatula after,
uh,

895
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,140
after she's done and just,
yeah,

896
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,640
that's great.
Yeah,

897
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:36,480
there was,
um,

898
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,560
I think there was a time where people
didn't understand how bad that stuff was

899
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:42,420
for you.
And this was probably a lot of people on

900
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:43,170
it,
right?

901
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,390
I don't know,
but probably going through a similar

902
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:50,391
period where all kinds of stuff is being
prescribed that we're gonna find out 50

903
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:51,330
years from now.

904
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,163
Like,
Oh really?

905
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,870
They're like,
we prescribed adderall to 50 million

906
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:56,700
children or whatever it was.
I'm sure.

907
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,860
Like it's just kind of sea monsters I
think.

908
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,960
Sure.
Something Someday Prozac,

909
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,320
adderall.
And then the numbers of Ssri is that are

910
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:07,320
prescribed needlessly.
Like who knows how many people actually

911
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:10,440
need those things versus how many people
were just having a bad day and went to

912
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:12,390
the doctor and they give you something
numbs you up.

913
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,350
Right,
right.

914
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:15,260
And how many,
how many schools are,

915
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,880
are mandated to,
you know,

916
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,190
to put,
you know,

917
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,820
bunch of kids on,
on these drugs.

918
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,590
I,
I think probably in hindsight,

919
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,920
some of that is going to look really bad
for sure.

920
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,210
I mean,
we're experimenting,

921
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,290
experimenting on People's brains and
absolutely these pharmaceutical

922
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:35,500
companies have billions of dollars in
massive influence and they're making it

923
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:36,010
so this stuff

924
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,410
is okay.
Maybe just had a look at the number of

925
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:41,590
people that are dying just dying from
opiate pills.

926
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,540
Right.
If those were illegal drugs,

927
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:46,060
we'd be saying that there's a,
there's two goddamn epidemic.

928
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,430
Absolutely.
Yeah.

929
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,670
Yeah.
But they,

930
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,400
uh,
there's no question that it's a

931
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:53,460
conscious strategy to get people hooked
and,

932
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:58,590
and get them taking those pills for in
every conceivable scenario so that they

933
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:03,700
will seek them out in other areas,
not in legally.

934
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,460
Um,
I think,

935
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,920
uh,
but some,

936
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:12,760
some prosecutor is going to have to
figure out some way to get to hold some

937
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:15,760
of those companies accountable because
they're definitely doing not on purpose,

938
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,650
but even if they do,
it seems like they just,

939
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:19,660
it's like the tobacco thing,
they get paid,

940
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:20,470
right.
You know,

941
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,830
they pay off a few billion dollars,
it's barely scratches at debt and then

942
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:26,620
they write it all off.
Jack up the price of everything a little

943
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:30,070
bit over the course of 10 years of
balances itself out to zero.

944
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,030
Right,
right,

945
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,950
right.
A couple of movies will be made,

946
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:35,170
but at the same thing will happen going
forward.

947
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,741
Yeah,
yeah,

948
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,960
exactly.
Like that Russell Crowe movie the

949
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:38,920
insider.
Yeah,

950
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:39,880
that was great.
Yeah,

951
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:41,530
it was a good movie.
It was a good movie.

952
00:39:41,531 --> 00:39:43,090
It was actually kind of more movie
about,

953
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,020
about the death of the press as it
turned out than it was a movie about the

954
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:49,420
death of the tobacco industry.
But um,

955
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,231
yeah,
it was,

956
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:52,390
it was really interesting.
Um,

957
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:57,570
what is it like being a reporter and
being a journalist rather today with all

958
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:02,611
this fake news talk like this?
This is a new thing,

959
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:07,980
this whole calling something fake news.
There's certainly is manufactured

960
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:11,050
stories and things that just aren't
true.

961
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,560
Websites that are just designed to get
people to click on them and they have

962
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,700
crazy stories that didn't really happen,
but they're pretty obvious.

963
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,080
Right?
Yeah.

964
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:23,830
And I think a lot of what people call
fake news is just news that is very

965
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:26,320
heavily slanted in one direction.
And you know,

966
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,470
people,
people talk a lot about how fox is fake

967
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,580
fake news.
Well,

968
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,970
most of the time when you watch Fox,
what they're just doing is they're

969
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:37,660
selectively picking out stories that
they know are going to rile up their

970
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,940
elderly,
a freaked out,

971
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:41,740
terrified audience,
you know,

972
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:46,030
and so they pick out the four or five
things that are,

973
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,030
that actually happened around the world.
They,

974
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,290
they can do that without lying.
You know,

975
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,120
they don't,
they don't have to make this stuff up.

976
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,450
They can find the,
the lineup of facts that they want.

977
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,260
Um,
but you know,

978
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,830
uh,
working as a journalist now is,

979
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,570
is,
um,

980
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,980
very,
very different.

981
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:07,981
The business is undergoing a extremely
rapid change and it's not something that

982
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:10,580
we really,
um,

983
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,450
have reckoned with.
We haven't sat down and had a discussion

984
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:15,710
about where this is all going and,
uh,

985
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,870
how we can fix it because,
um,

986
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,050
the business is changing in a way that
is extremely negative and no one's

987
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:25,150
talking about how to,
how to reverse that.

988
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,180
Like long form investigative reporting
is started to disappear,

989
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,380
uh,
in the 80s,

990
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:34,160
but it's accelerated to the point

991
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,160
where there's almost none of that now.
Almost everybody who works in the

992
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:42,161
business is doing quick hits and there's
almost no time left to do,

993
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,190
you know,
kind of Real,

994
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:50,930
real hardcore investigative work.
And we've trained our audiences also to

995
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:54,260
be unable to consume that kind of stuff.
Um,

996
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,760
so,
you know,

997
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:58,850
we're,
we're all basically doing clickbait now

998
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,010
and,
and I think it's,

999
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,170
it's a really dark time in our business.

1000
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:03,920
Well,
it's,

1001
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,840
it's also this weird time of
transitioning between paper and digital

1002
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,970
and trying to get people to pay for
digital.

1003
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,120
I mean,
I subscribed to a few of them online,

1004
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,810
a Washington Post New York Times where
you pay,

1005
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,600
but I don't think very many people are
doing that.

1006
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,150
I think it's probably a small amount of
people that are paying.

1007
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,000
Right.
You know,

1008
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,320
I think the New York Times gives you
like 10 articles a month or something

1009
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:28,060
like that for free.
And then like,

1010
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:28,691
come on,
man,

1011
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:30,970
you're here every day.
Time to pay up.

1012
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,000
You know,
they give you like a little countdown,

1013
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:33,671
then you're like,
oh,

1014
00:42:33,671 --> 00:42:34,660
this is a good article.
All right,

1015
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:35,340
I'm going to pay.

1016
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,210
Yeah.
And this is,

1017
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:40,140
this is a fascinating sort of sub plot
to what happened to the media business

1018
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:44,970
because a lot of that is because of
something that Google did a long time

1019
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:46,440
ago.
They had this thing called the first

1020
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:50,760
click rule,
which is the sort of mandated that all

1021
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:55,790
all new sites have at least some free
content or else the algorithm would,

1022
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,400
would push the,
the,

1023
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,740
uh,
new story far down on the search

1024
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:02,970
results,
right?

1025
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,760
So if you,
if you didn't have free content on your

1026
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:08,400
site,
if you didn't meet Google's first click

1027
00:43:08,401 --> 00:43:09,520
rule,
uh,

1028
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,870
when you search for a new story,
you just wouldn't find it.

1029
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,540
So all of these,
um,

1030
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,610
in the early days of sort of digital
journalism,

1031
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,530
uh,
all the news companies offered their

1032
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:26,640
content basically for free and,
uh,

1033
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:31,910
that trained audiences to not pay for
journalism basically.

1034
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,430
Uh,
and it's,

1035
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,040
it's pretty hard to put the genie back
in the bottle and tell everybody to go

1036
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:40,290
back and,
and pay for everything.

1037
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:42,350
It just doesn't work that way.
Uh,

1038
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,390
so,
uh,

1039
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,360
we're,
we're in this place where everybody sort

1040
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:47,850
of consuming free media and not only
that,

1041
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,260
there's this additional problem of the,
you know,

1042
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:54,690
the internet platforms like facebook and
Google,

1043
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,550
um,
pushing news that they already know

1044
00:43:59,551 --> 00:44:02,460
people are going to agree with two
users.

1045
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,450
So there's,
there's,

1046
00:44:03,451 --> 00:44:06,000
there's sort of less news that
challenges people,

1047
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,800
uh,
they're just not going to see it,

1048
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,360
you know,
because that's not the way the

1049
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:10,290
algorithms work.

1050
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,120
The algorithms are really confusing.
So the algorithms like will actively

1051
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:18,540
pick out things they think you'll be
interested in.

1052
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,140
So if you're someone who has got a
particular set of interest,

1053
00:44:22,141 --> 00:44:23,520
it,
it becomes sort of a,

1054
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:24,810
an echo chamber,
right?

1055
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:26,760
Your Google search becomes an echo
chamber.

1056
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:29,580
You're go,
I have that Google News App on my phone.

1057
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,020
I'll check it every morning,
see what's going,

1058
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,400
but it's all shit that I'm interested

1059
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,180
in.
Right,

1060
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,140
right.
It's,

1061
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,050
it's probably a little bit worse on
facebook than it is on Google,

1062
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:39,250
but because it's google,
you at least have some,

1063
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,250
some control over what you searched for.
But even Google will will prompt you

1064
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:45,810
with things,
right?

1065
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,150
Like so,
but with,

1066
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:49,710
um,
with both of them,

1067
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:50,371
yeah.
They,

1068
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:52,560
they're,
they're accumulating lots and lots of

1069
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:56,790
information about your,
not only about what you read but about

1070
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,310
the things that you buy,
the movies that you watch,

1071
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,490
what your predilections probably are and
what your opinions,

1072
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:06,660
your political stances.
And so they pick out a new stories that

1073
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:11,490
they think are,
are likely to endorse or spent a lot of

1074
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:13,350
time reading.
Um,

1075
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:18,410
which likely means that you're never
going to see a news story that says you

1076
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,820
personally are responsible for something
bad.

1077
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,350
Right.
That's like thing one,

1078
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,050
uh,
you will see a lot of news stories that

1079
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:27,960
say your neighbor is responsible for
something bad.

1080
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,540
Uh,
and that's one of the reasons why like

1081
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,570
divisiveness is a conscious commercial
strategy.

1082
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:34,890
It's just,
it's,

1083
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,940
it's a natural,
uh,

1084
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,020
result of a lot of this,
a lot of these behaviors.

1085
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,950
What is the mean age of people that are
watching Fox News?

1086
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:46,200
You're talking about like how it's like
people 68.

1087
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,551
Yeah,
it's,

1088
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:50,520
it's something ridiculously all the,
and that's true of all the,

1089
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:53,360
all the cable networks,
they're all MSNBC.

1090
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,960
Yeah.
Even Msnbc,

1091
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,760
um,
the,

1092
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:57,750
you know,
it's,

1093
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,100
it's worse with Fox and,
and uh,

1094
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,330
and CNN and I don't want to,
I don't want to misquote it,

1095
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,360
but I know they're all like above 65.
Um,

1096
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,050
so

1097
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,290
[inaudible] 68,
you're right.

1098
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:17,430
Look at that median age of a prime time
at Fox News.

1099
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:24,590
Do we do we have an MSAC 65,
the younguns CNN 60.

1100
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:25,740
Oh,
they're little kids.

1101
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,650
Wow.
Yeah.

1102
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:33,060
And so a lot of that has to do with the
fact that young people just don't watch

1103
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:33,730
television.
Right.

1104
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,370
Like they,
they're done.

1105
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,430
They're done.
So they're getting their news some other

1106
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:40,340
way.
They're not getting it ready.

1107
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:40,671
Well,
yeah,

1108
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:44,220
they're night or they're not getting it
in youtube videos,

1109
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,100
getting almost no news.
Right,

1110
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,971
right.
Exactly.

1111
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:47,090
Yeah.

1112
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:47,511
I mean,
it's a,

1113
00:46:47,511 --> 00:46:48,321
it's a post to,
like,

1114
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:50,600
when I was a kid,
I mean,

1115
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:52,850
what are the,
I used to deliver newspapers,

1116
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,570
so I've read newspapers quite a bit.
Did you?

1117
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,700
Yeah.
You want to do the globe?

1118
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,820
Yeah,
I did until I was a paper boy.

1119
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,530
Where was your route?
Ah,

1120
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,490
let's see.
I had one in Hingham.

1121
00:47:01,491 --> 00:47:04,340
I had one in Norwell.
Wow.

1122
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,440
Yeah,
I did mostly Newton.

1123
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,430
Newton.
Okay.

1124
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,900
Yeah,
I did the globe.

1125
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,340
I did the,
um,

1126
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,330
the Herald Boston Herald and I delivered
the New York Times for awhile.

1127
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,800
But just so I didn't like the New York
Times is interesting because it wasn't,

1128
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:21,800
didn't pay as well.
And there were a larger routes,

1129
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:26,210
like you had to go much further because
there was very few houses that would get

1130
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:28,850
the times right.
But you felt like you were doing

1131
00:47:28,851 --> 00:47:29,740
something special

1132
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,810
liver and the New York Times that the
prestige to it and they had clear blue

1133
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,860
plastic bags.
Oh Wow.

1134
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,930
Is that a blue bag?
Like the Boston Globe at clear bags,

1135
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:45,250
they deliver those in clear bags,
but the times the Herald should have

1136
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:47,910
been in a brown paper bag,
like a,

1137
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,280
like a porno or something like that.
Did they,

1138
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,520
do they deliver like the Daily News and
the post in New York?

1139
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,170
Does that get delivered or is it just,
yeah,

1140
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:58,360
I mean they must,
um,

1141
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,020
yeah,
they have,

1142
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:04,020
they have subscriptions and then,
and the times is the daily news

1143
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:06,910
definitely does have a delivery for
sure.

1144
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,320
Yeah,
I would think so.

1145
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,570
Yeah.
But,

1146
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,940
but that I just spent a lot of time
writing about this.

1147
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:15,910
The,
the VAT model where,

1148
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,360
uh,
newspapers had this direct relationship

1149
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,920
with their readers,
right?

1150
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:25,840
Like they not only owned the content and
created the content,

1151
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:27,850
but they also,
uh,

1152
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,760
completely controlled the distribution.
Right?

1153
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:34,000
They had the trucks,
they had the paper kids like us.

1154
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,350
Right.
Um,

1155
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,970
that was all part of what gave the press
it's power is that we were,

1156
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:42,400
we had the unique ability to reach all
these people.

1157
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:43,590
Well,
you know,

1158
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,720
once the Internet came along,
they cut that in half.

1159
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:49,630
Right?
So now the distribution is all google

1160
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:51,570
and facebook,
uh,

1161
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:54,910
and the content is all being made by
somebody else.

1162
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:57,240
So it's um,
it,

1163
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,200
it makes it very difficult to make
money,

1164
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:03,310
uh,
a and then b you just don't have that,

1165
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,140
that personal relationship with the,
with the,

1166
00:49:06,141 --> 00:49:07,840
the,
the consumer anymore,

1167
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:10,240
which is,
which is a completely different sort of

1168
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:13,750
paradigm.
I do you think there's a connection to

1169
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:16,300
ponder this myself?
It seems like in the early days of the

1170
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:19,540
Internet,
one a big factor with the music industry

1171
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:23,830
for sure was napster.
Napster came along and then people got

1172
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:27,280
this initial taste of getting a bunch of
stuff that you'd normally paid for,

1173
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:29,680
for free,
get just get tons of it.

1174
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:33,850
And then so the internet sort of got
associated with being a free thing and

1175
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:37,630
then there was bit torrent and through
bit torrent you can get films and all

1176
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:40,480
kinds of different stuff.
You could download movies and,

1177
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,600
and people just start filling up hard
drives with this stuff that they would

1178
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:44,620
get off a bit torrent.

1179
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:49,720
And in my mind at least it became this
connection with the Internet.

1180
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,480
Stuff's free.
There's so much stuff for free.

1181
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:53,880
Like why would I pay for this?
Right.

1182
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,040
And that's free.
And I've,

1183
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:59,740
I've tried to say this to friends who
get involved with podcasting,

1184
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:03,610
who have come over from radio,
like just friends that have been fired

1185
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:04,690
from radio jobs.
Like,

1186
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:06,130
you know what,
I'm just going to start a podcast and

1187
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:09,220
charge people five bucks a month.
But as soon as you do that,

1188
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,280
people are like,
why the fuck would I pay get Adam

1189
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,590
Carolla for free?
Joey Diaz for free?

1190
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:16,810
Why would I pay $5 for you?

1191
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:17,853
Right.
Yeah,

1192
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:21,660
absolutely know that the audience
expectations now or that they're going

1193
00:50:21,661 --> 00:50:23,130
to get free content,
everything's free,

1194
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,840
everything's free.
And,

1195
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,980
um,
obviously that has a

1196
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,980
huge consequences because that forces
people who create the content to get the

1197
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:36,020
money from somewhere else.
They either have to be sponsored by an

1198
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:39,410
advertiser who might have certain
expectations.

1199
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,470
Um,
but it,

1200
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,160
you know,
it's certainly not good for the people

1201
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:44,520
who,
who make content that,

1202
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,830
that,
that it's like that.

1203
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,250
Uh,
and,

1204
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:47,991
and it creates,
I think,

1205
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:49,820
a lot of bad habits with,
um,

1206
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,620
with,
with the readers too.

1207
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:52,850
I mean they,
they just,

1208
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,110
you know,
rather than,

1209
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:58,760
rather than look for the best stuff,
they just look for what's available and

1210
00:50:58,761 --> 00:50:59,900
what they can read for free.

1211
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,590
Also,
I think it opens up the door to all this

1212
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:07,210
wacky advertising where pop up ads and,
and scroll down ads.

1213
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:10,150
Like you try to scroll down a screen and
the ad follows with you and then,

1214
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,380
Oh God,
so annoying.

1215
00:51:11,381 --> 00:51:12,340
Right.
It's weird.

1216
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,011
It's just,
it,

1217
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:14,590
it's,
they're so invasive and they're

1218
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,690
everywhere.
Even on really good websites.

1219
00:51:16,691 --> 00:51:18,670
Like,
like say if you go to CNN,

1220
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,080
you get the real stories and then below
you get this stuff that looks like

1221
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,540
stories.
But there's a very faint print,

1222
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,850
it says paid content.
Right.

1223
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:31,330
And then you look at it like you're not
going to believe what she looks like now

1224
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,860
and then you click and you can't be
outbrain.

1225
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,900
Yeah.
I can't even find out what she looks

1226
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:41,800
like now cause you've got to go through
40 other people that look like shit now

1227
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:44,530
too.
And then finally you get it.

1228
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,300
Sometimes you don't even get to the
original one.

1229
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:48,700
So you're confused.
I think it's better if they don't

1230
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:51,270
satisfy you because then he'd just go
back to the rest of the site.

1231
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:53,830
Well what does he look like?
You know,

1232
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:58,480
you go to all these different,
there was like one of those pages that

1233
00:51:58,481 --> 00:52:03,481
you go to where there's just dozens and
dozens of windows and boxes that you can

1234
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:08,500
click on different individual like
cliquey bait stories where you go to

1235
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:12,880
each one of them and they'll take you to
40 pages of different people that have

1236
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:16,810
gained weight or lost weight or a poor
now or whatever it is.

1237
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:19,140
But that's,
I mean,

1238
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:24,450
I think it's one of the things that's
really bad about that is that if you

1239
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:27,720
spend enough time doing that,
your brain stops being able to do other

1240
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:28,590
things.
You know,

1241
00:52:28,591 --> 00:52:33,450
like when you're reading books,
books require you to sit there and

1242
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:37,710
construct in your head all the visuals
for everything that you're reading.

1243
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,380
You have to imagine what the people look
like.

1244
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,030
You have to,
you know,

1245
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,240
do all this mental work to construct the
scene,

1246
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,700
right?
So your brain is actively engaged in,

1247
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,800
in this,
in this really highly specific.

1248
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:51,150
And,
and creative way.

1249
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,070
Right.
Um,

1250
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,540
but the Internet now just has it moving
from place to place,

1251
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:01,500
clicking from place to place,
going from sensation to sensation.

1252
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,840
Um,
you don't have to ponder anything.

1253
00:53:03,841 --> 00:53:06,420
You don't have to have an opinion about
anything.

1254
00:53:06,421 --> 00:53:08,520
You don't have to look at both sides of
anything.

1255
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:11,070
You just have to move from one thing to
another to the next thing,

1256
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:12,600
which is what you're talking about with
trump.

1257
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,520
That's the way his brain works.
Right?

1258
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,530
Like,
and it's,

1259
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:18,220
it's uh,
I think it's a bad thing,

1260
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,430
you know,
it's not only bad in itself,

1261
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,740
but it makes it impossible for us to do
the other thing,

1262
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,491
you know,
which is,

1263
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,590
which is more constructive.
Yeah.

1264
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:26,010
No,
it's

1265
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,180
almost like mental range of motion.
Like if you're somehow or another,

1266
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:33,660
your joints were restricted where you
could only like move a certain amount

1267
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,120
after a while,
you would lose your full range of

1268
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:37,140
motion.
Absolutely.

1269
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:39,470
It gets atrophied.
I have a heart,

1270
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,490
I'm reading books now than I did when I
was,

1271
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,620
you know,
probably 11 years old.

1272
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,530
And,
and that's just from,

1273
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,670
and you're a writer.
Write,

1274
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:48,504
I'm a writer.
I mean,

1275
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:49,470
I love,
I love it.

1276
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,300
Yeah.
I still,

1277
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:54,570
I find that I have a harder time doing
the work,

1278
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,463
you know?
Yeah.

1279
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,520
And that's difficult.
Or like when I was,

1280
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:02,100
when I was younger,
I read more fiction,

1281
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:05,070
which,
which is harder because it requires you

1282
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:06,540
to do more,
you know,

1283
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,290
sort of mental construction work.
Um,

1284
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,790
now it's much,
if I'm going to read a book,

1285
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,830
it's typically nonfiction,
which is linear,

1286
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:15,270
which is an argument,
right?

1287
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:16,230
It's,
it's,

1288
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:17,520
um,
it's,

1289
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:19,650
it's less,
it requires less work of the

1290
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:20,550
[inaudible].
Right.

1291
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,400
It may be just as interesting,
but it just requires less work.

1292
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,400
Uh,
so like the hardest thing to read is,

1293
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,890
you know,
Anna Karenina or something like that.

1294
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:31,500
Right.
But you have to not only think,

1295
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,840
but you have to construct,
but with your,

1296
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,820
if you're just reading the diary of Kim
Kim,

1297
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,830
Kim Kardashian or something like that,
you're just,

1298
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:39,510
you're just kind of listening to
somebody,

1299
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:40,740
you know,
go look like that.

1300
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:44,430
So I think it's bad.
I think all of this stuff is negative,

1301
00:54:44,431 --> 00:54:46,920
but I dunno.
Maybe I'm an old fogy about it.

1302
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,220
Yeah.

1303
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:47,701
Well,
I,

1304
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:52,500
I definitely think it's not the most
ideal in terms of constructing a healthy

1305
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:53,400
mind.
Right,

1306
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,720
right.
But,

1307
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,580
but it's what we got.
Yeah.

1308
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:57,990
And it's,
it's weird.

1309
00:54:57,991 --> 00:54:58,280
It's so

1310
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,050
weird time.
Absolutely.

1311
00:55:00,051 --> 00:55:01,430
And it's,
and you know,

1312
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,230
there's,
there's lots of positive things.

1313
00:55:03,231 --> 00:55:06,710
The positive things are like that.
Anybody can have a voice now and anybody

1314
00:55:06,711 --> 00:55:10,610
who has something interesting to say can
be instantly elevated and have an

1315
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,980
audience overnight.
And that's great.

1316
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:13,671
Right?
Like,

1317
00:55:13,671 --> 00:55:14,021
you know,
the,

1318
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:14,860
the,
in the,

1319
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:19,550
in the old days,
if you had to penetrate this ridiculous

1320
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,120
oligarchy of entertainment,
people who,

1321
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:27,230
who really own tightly controlled,
who got access to what,

1322
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,460
who got to be,
you know,

1323
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:32,660
have an audience a and now you get to
bypass that entirely and sort of

1324
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:34,250
directly appeal to,
to,

1325
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,720
to people,
which is great.

1326
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:36,980
I mean,
that's an amazing thing.

1327
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,900
But then you get youtube stars,
right?

1328
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:40,670
Yeah,
exactly right.

1329
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,610
Yeah.
I went down a little rabbit hole the

1330
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,690
other day.
You fucking asshole.

1331
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:49,430
Jamie told me about little town.
He would tell him a little day.

1332
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:53,510
So I went down this crazy rabbit hole
and then I read this Jessebelle article

1333
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,090
about another,
a rider who went down a little tay

1334
00:55:56,091 --> 00:55:58,700
rabbit hole,
and so I went down that rabbit hole.

1335
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,470
Oh my God.
Wait,

1336
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:03,950
who is a little tail?
Little Tay is a nine year old girl,

1337
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:08,660
is famous now on the Internet for
talking Shit and showing all the money

1338
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:12,860
she has and all the things she buys.
If you don't know about little tank,

1339
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:13,723
no,
no.

1340
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,250
This is the death of society.
Okay.

1341
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,900
Little Tase.
The death of society.

1342
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:19,280
Lil Lil tank.
Can we,

1343
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:20,091
can we see that?
Yes,

1344
00:56:20,091 --> 00:56:21,050
for sure.
Oh,

1345
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,120
the youngest of the flexor of the
century.

1346
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:26,830
Who makes cash?
Me Outside.

1347
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:31,831
Girl looked like a scholar.
She's fucking nine dude.

1348
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,700
Okay.
I have a nine year old.

1349
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,660
All right.
This is crazy.

1350
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:38,380
Play played this video jamie so he can
understand what little taze all about.

1351
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,710
That's her revenue per lamborghini.
She gets out.

1352
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,780
Tell Him Jake,
just throwing money

1353
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,570
at them when you're alive.

1354
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,430
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next president of United States and

1355
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,220
he's,
he's bound in the background.

1356
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,900
I mean,
this is what we're doing.

1357
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,660
What we're doing and this is what
society is doing.

1358
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:26,570
This makes honey booboo and it's like
Marie Curie,

1359
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,200
you know what I mean?
God Ram.

1360
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:33,510
It's got 337,000 likes.
God dammit.

1361
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,390
Jamie,
what have you done?

1362
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:40,160
We all hear stunting on all y'all broke
ass haters.

1363
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:44,030
500 K in cash.
And this lambo costs more than your

1364
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:48,290
college tuition.
I'm nine and I ain't got no license.

1365
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:51,890
Apparently all our shits rented.
Okay.

1366
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,510
You know what?
I'm embarrassed to admit this,

1367
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,030
but I would watch this over reading my
own articles.

1368
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,600
So what the fuck I'm going to,
it will just give up.

1369
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:04,640
Know what to do,
what to do.

1370
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:08,210
What do we do?
Where's little Tay in 40 years?

1371
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,880
That's what I want to know.
Where's the lighthouse?

1372
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:13,050
Definitely the White House.
Where,

1373
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:18,100
where else after Kanye is children.
When she's good,

1374
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:19,700
she's going to be next.
I mean,

1375
00:58:19,701 --> 00:58:21,380
that's an interesting thought exercise
though.

1376
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:23,120
Like where do you go down from Donald
Trump?

1377
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:25,280
I mean,
cause the progression has to go down,

1378
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:26,340
right?
Are we all done?

1379
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,940
Cause I remember when Bush was
president,

1380
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:33,050
uh,
like are we talking to reporters?

1381
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,710
Bush used to do this thing where he
would carry around a biography of Dean

1382
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:37,670
Aitchison,
um,

1383
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:40,940
for weeks and weeks and weeks,
just approved reporters that he could

1384
00:58:40,941 --> 00:58:43,200
read.
Uh,

1385
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,170
we all used to joke with each other
like,

1386
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,870
nobody,
nobody's stupider than this is ever

1387
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:51,190
going to be president.
And now you know,

1388
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,240
you look back and,
and bushes,

1389
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:53,801
you know,
he's,

1390
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:55,470
he's like Einstein compared to,
to,

1391
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:58,580
to trump.
I had a joke that I did back in my

1392
00:58:58,581 --> 00:59:03,581
netflix special from 2005 were when Bush
was in office where it was a bunch of

1393
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:08,900
people were trying to figure out how
dumb people are.

1394
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,470
And they're like,
the only way they like there

1395
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,230
speculation.
Like,

1396
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:14,090
let's get a smart guy to act dumb.
Like,

1397
00:59:14,091 --> 00:59:14,331
no,
no,

1398
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:16,400
no.
You got to get a real dumb guy.

1399
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,030
Otherwise we'll never know.
You gotta have a real dumb guy.

1400
00:59:20,031 --> 00:59:22,080
And then so they get the real guy and
they put up do

1401
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,180
a bunch of things,
you know,

1402
00:59:23,181 --> 00:59:25,430
they,
they vote him in a second time and then

1403
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:28,100
someone in the back of the room goes,
I think we can go dumber

1404
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,310
and this is where we are.
Right.

1405
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:38,660
This is a bit from 2005 but you know,
13 years later,

1406
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,400
life imitates art.
We went away.

1407
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:41,630
Dumber.
That's right.

1408
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,760
Right.
Well do a lab which seems super

1409
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:47,210
reasonable in comparison to some of the
shit that trump says in terms of like

1410
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:49,760
supreme court rulings and like,
um,

1411
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:53,720
there was a supreme court ruling that
went against bushes way while he was an

1412
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:56,300
office and he had a really reasonable
response.

1413
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:58,010
He was like,
of course we're disappointed,

1414
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,560
but we have to abide by the court and
their ruling.

1415
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:02,720
And you know,
it was like something you would never

1416
01:00:02,721 --> 01:00:05,360
hear trump say.
Never hear him say something like that.

1417
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:06,380
No,
absolutely.

1418
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,510
I mean,
I,

1419
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,720
I,
I look back and Bush seems to me almost

1420
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:15,620
like a Scandinavian statesmen compared
to compared to Donald Trump,

1421
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,820
but
she would go to the White House to,

1422
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,470
you know,
a lot of people did want to go to the

1423
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,810
White House for the inauguration.
A little table go.

1424
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,340
She'll go.
I mean,

1425
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:27,350
the White House is good.
It's going to look like the White House

1426
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:29,480
and idiocrasy when she's,
when she's in there.

1427
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,500
Right.
I mean it's,

1428
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,820
it's a,
it's,

1429
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,410
it's going to be terrible,
but,

1430
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,090
well,
that was a weird time too,

1431
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:36,710
right?
Like during the inauguration when no

1432
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:40,100
celebrities wanted to go and they dig
out like really weird,

1433
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:45,160
like real fucking on the outskirts
celebrities.

1434
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:46,310
It was,
yeah.

1435
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,110
And it was the same thing with the RNC.
I cover,

1436
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,720
I remember I covered the RNC and,
and uh,

1437
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:55,070
and they had to have Scott Bayeux,
uh,

1438
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,020
do one of the first day speeches.

1439
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,870
Got bail is a huge supporter.
Right.

1440
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:01,010
But I mean,
I know Scott,

1441
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,380
I know personally,
it's very nice guy.

1442
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,450
I'm sure he is.
I'm sure it has guy.

1443
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

1444
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:08,120
But that was their,
that was their,

1445
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:11,550
a list for the Republican National
Convention and uh,

1446
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,060
um,
outside of,

1447
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,610
you know,
like the Hannitys and those type

1448
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:17,390
fellows.
Right,

1449
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,350
right,
exactly.

1450
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

1451
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,200
That's fascinating.
Yeah,

1452
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:23,360
it is.
It's just,

1453
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,610
it's just weird.
It's,

1454
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,910
it just seems like everything's off.
Like we,

1455
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:31,940
we,
we skipped dimensions were like jolted

1456
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:36,941
over isn't parallel world where things
just don't seem like at least things

1457
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,910
used to make set.
Like you'd be disappointed at this guy

1458
01:01:40,911 --> 01:01:44,870
won or you'd be disappointed that the
country was doing this or that we were

1459
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:49,280
invading Iraq or whatever it was.
But it would kind of seem like the

1460
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:50,720
world.
Right.

1461
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:51,980
Well,
this is it.

1462
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,540
It's kind of like what we're talking
about.

1463
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,560
We were talking about before,
I mean previously,

1464
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:02,270
like the entertainment industry,
politics was tightly controlled by a

1465
01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:07,271
small group of Cigar chomping people who
sat in the back room and in both parties

1466
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:09,540
they,
they had,

1467
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:11,600
uh,
they carefully outlined a sort of

1468
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:15,230
narrow,
a range of acceptable political

1469
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,110
opinions.
And in one party,

1470
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,670
you could be all the way up to,
you know,

1471
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:24,750
somebody like Ron Paul,
but they tended to put somebody like

1472
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:27,660
George Bush that as the candidate.
Um,

1473
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,890
but you know,
there was no directly appealing to the

1474
01:02:31,891 --> 01:02:35,730
electorate and asking them who they want
it to be,

1475
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:36,690
the candidate.
I mean,

1476
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:39,300
Donald Trump is really the first
internet president.

1477
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:43,230
He completely bypassed that entire
oligarchy.

1478
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:46,260
He didn't have to go through,
um,

1479
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:49,230
you know,
the priesthood to get to be president,

1480
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:53,490
which on the one hand is evidence of a
good thing because it's actually more

1481
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:54,910
democratic than the,
the,

1482
01:02:54,911 --> 01:02:57,330
the,
the system was before where it was

1483
01:02:57,331 --> 01:03:01,290
pretty much close to everybody except
for a few people who paid their dues

1484
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,340
through the system.

1485
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,020
Uh,
but trump direct,

1486
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,390
you know,
just by being famous and just by

1487
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:08,550
attracting media attention,
uh,

1488
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,880
he was able to bypass all of the usual
tests and bypass the parties,

1489
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,370
you know,
decision making process,

1490
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:20,160
and he got to be president.
But he's like little pay,

1491
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:20,731
right?
I mean,

1492
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:23,820
he's,
he just represents the dumber side of us

1493
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:25,860
as opposed to the more enlightened side
of us.

1494
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:27,120
So,
uh,

1495
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:28,830
it's,
it's hard to know what to think about

1496
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:29,171
it.
I mean,

1497
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:30,930
I,
I when I was covering it,

1498
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:34,860
I thought on the one hand,
this is evidence that the electorate is

1499
01:03:34,861 --> 01:03:37,470
breaking away from being told who to
vote for.

1500
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,000
Uh,
on the other hand,

1501
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,090
the first time they take it,
that freedom and for a test drive,

1502
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:43,470
this is what they pick.
I mean,

1503
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:46,800
I don't know lease,
it throws a giant monkey wrench into the

1504
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:47,690
gears.
Right?

1505
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,570
Yeah,
absolutely.

1506
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:51,180
It's certainly done that.
But you know what,

1507
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,530
what the result of that will be is,
is yet to be determined yet to be

1508
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:56,400
determined.
Yeah.

1509
01:03:56,401 --> 01:04:01,401
I mean it could be the end of civil,
I said this before,

1510
01:04:01,681 --> 01:04:02,850
that,
you know,

1511
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:08,630
when I was covering the trump run,
part of me wanted to write it as a

1512
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:11,520
comedy.
Like all the early stories were like

1513
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,980
highly comic.
I was trying to write about the funny

1514
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:17,100
aspect of it and then after he became
president,

1515
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:18,900
it's like,
well,

1516
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,070
this is either the funniest thing that's
ever happened in America or it's the end

1517
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:24,630
of civilization.
Right.

1518
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,090
Does that make it funnier?
That's the end of the civilization.

1519
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:27,901
I don't know.
I mean,

1520
01:04:27,901 --> 01:04:29,340
you're the erotic comics,
so I should,

1521
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:30,960
I should ask you about,
I don't know either.

1522
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:31,351
It's,
well,

1523
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:33,150
it's,
it's all depending upon how it plays

1524
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:33,870
out,
right?

1525
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,060
I mean,
civilizations have absolutely fallen in

1526
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:39,810
the past.
This idea that civilization won't fall,

1527
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,780
in my opinion,
is akin to the people that live on the

1528
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:45,600
big island thinking that the volcano
won't erupt again.

1529
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,291
Right,
right.

1530
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:47,130
Yeah,
exactly.

1531
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,200
Yeah.
And it's going to happen again,

1532
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,820
like so will,
our ideas about maintaining civilization

1533
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:58,821
are an attempt to prolong this state or
mitigate any possible disastrous effects

1534
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,650
of collapse.
Right.

1535
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:03,750
But it's going to fall apart.
Of course,

1536
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:09,290
it's an old system that was constructed
on scrolls by people writing with

1537
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:12,270
feathered.
They really had no idea what the future

1538
01:05:12,271 --> 01:05:13,470
hadn't stall.
Right.

1539
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,260
We didn't,
they didn't know what the future had in

1540
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:17,094
store.
They had no,

1541
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,040
they would have

1542
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,930
been terrified by a toothbrush.
Yes.

1543
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,823
Right.
Yeah.

1544
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,670
Well,
certainly by a fucking airplane and

1545
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:29,671
cellular communication and this,
we live in a world that requires a

1546
01:05:30,071 --> 01:05:33,250
completely new set of rules and
guidelines.

1547
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,740
And you know,
this has always been the article against

1548
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:37,090
the second amendment like,
okay,

1549
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:38,980
did they had muskets when they wrote
this?

1550
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:43,110
They didn't have ar fifteens.
They didn't have 50 caliber guns that

1551
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,010
can kill things.
One,

1552
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:50,011
they miss them playing a video yesterday
of a guy shooting a deer and with a 50

1553
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:53,980
caliber rifle and he misses the deer and
it still kills the deer.

1554
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:59,290
The bullet going past the deer's head,
just of sheer force of it blows the

1555
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:02,560
deer's brains out dead.
Is that actually it happened?

1556
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,390
Oh yeah,
I want to watch it.

1557
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,700
Yeah,
absolutely.

1558
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,720
Pull it up.
Keep that one on a favorites to make a

1559
01:06:11,261 --> 01:06:14,200
folder for shit.
We repetitively talk about

1560
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:17,320
when I was embedded,
interact,

1561
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:20,320
they,
they took me out and the guys apparently

1562
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:23,880
for recreation and they,
they cut cars and half with 50 cal

1563
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:25,680
calibers.
Here's the,

1564
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,730
here's the gun.
Now watch this.

1565
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:32,910
He misses boom and watch it.
It just falls down dead

1566
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:41,650
from the bullet passing it.
This is like Jesus.

1567
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,910
It just whizzed by it and the force of
the bullet passing by.

1568
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,840
He's psyched,
right?

1569
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:47,381
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1570
01:06:47,381 --> 01:06:48,760
Watch.
But watch the slow Mo,

1571
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:54,590
it just falls down.
He's like,

1572
01:06:55,020 --> 01:07:00,020
thank God this guy's got Cammo on a
million miles away and literally sitting

1573
01:07:00,481 --> 01:07:03,270
on a bench,
he's on a bench shooting something in

1574
01:07:03,271 --> 01:07:06,480
the distance,
but he picks his deer up and the deer's

1575
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,910
brains,
we just completely scrambled.

1576
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,940
No,
no bolt wound at all.

1577
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:14,040
Nothing.
No whole dead.

1578
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:17,130
That's a,
that's a horror movie waiting to happen.

1579
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:19,180
That deer's going to wake up in the
middle of the night and,

1580
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,890
and reanimated and uh Oh,
what happened?

1581
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:25,860
So the brands coming out of the ears
coming out of the ears.

1582
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:28,590
Yeah,
just from the sheer force of the bullet

1583
01:07:28,591 --> 01:07:30,530
passing it.
Jesus.

1584
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:35,620
That's all I'm saying is it would be a
good time to reconsider how we run

1585
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:39,750
things.
And I think one of the good things about

1586
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:42,570
having a guy like trump and offices,
maybe we should sit down and say,

1587
01:07:42,571 --> 01:07:44,820
hey,
we probably shouldn't have a popularity

1588
01:07:44,821 --> 01:07:46,680
contest.
So he who controls the nukes?

1589
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:52,200
See who's the commander in chief of the
greatest army that the planet has ever

1590
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:55,890
known right?
Far the most destructive force the

1591
01:07:55,891 --> 01:07:58,020
planet has ever known.
Shouldn't we?

1592
01:07:58,021 --> 01:08:00,440
At least find out if he's on diet pills,
right.

1593
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:02,210
Shouldn't be at least shouldn't be
saved.

1594
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:05,460
Mr President,
we'd like a urine sample from you.

1595
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:06,991
Yeah,
exactly.

1596
01:08:06,991 --> 01:08:09,360
After They Test Your pee if you work at
ups.

1597
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:10,350
Right,
right,

1598
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:11,730
right.
Yeah,

1599
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:12,481
yeah.
No,

1600
01:08:12,481 --> 01:08:15,980
I think there,
there should be more a pee test

1601
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,290
for launching a nuclear strike.
Definitely

1602
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:22,260
spit a lot.
Lot of changes and one thing I'm hoping

1603
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:24,860
is that this does this presidency and
the,

1604
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,790
the,
the whole idea of like having a

1605
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:29,780
popularity contest will allow people to
realize like,

1606
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,190
first of all,
we shouldn't have one alpha champ

1607
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,900
running things.
That's,

1608
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:35,910
that's an antiquated idea.
That was really great.

1609
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,390
And a tribe of 50 nomads,
right.

1610
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:39,990
Get them together and you have the
wisest,

1611
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:42,060
strongest one with the most battle
experience.

1612
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,580
That guy should be running things.
He knows more than I do.

1613
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:45,390
Right?
I get it.

1614
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:49,230
Let's vote for ORC or,
or it's the guy with the knowledge,

1615
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:51,180
you know,
it makes sense,

1616
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:56,010
but when there's 350 million people and
you have the ability to manipulate

1617
01:08:56,011 --> 01:09:00,720
things and you have tweets and facebook
posts and write could make wacky little

1618
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:03,750
tay videos were not designed for this.
No,

1619
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:04,790
no.
And

1620
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:09,790
we have some structures that rely on the
popularity contest and some that have,

1621
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,860
the public has no control over
whatsoever.

1622
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:15,140
Like Federal Reserve.
Like it doesn't,

1623
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,540
a lot of it makes no sense at all.

1624
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,900
Or how net neutrality got passed with
five different people or how it got

1625
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:22,460
rescinded.

1626
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,181
Right,
right.

1627
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:24,050
Yeah,
exactly.

1628
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:24,920
Yeah,
yeah.

1629
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,850
No,
I mean it's,

1630
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,120
the system doesn't really make a whole
lot of sense.

1631
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:30,470
The,
the,

1632
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:35,340
the s Congress and uncovering
congressional races now in the run up to

1633
01:09:35,341 --> 01:09:37,960
two,
2018 and you know,

1634
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:41,200
the process is almost 100% about money.
It's just like,

1635
01:09:41,201 --> 01:09:44,150
you know,
like I talked to a guy who was,

1636
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:46,820
who,
who jumped in and in the ring to run for

1637
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:49,160
a seat in the,
in the 19th district.

1638
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:52,490
And he told me he calls up the National
Party and they re they basically had

1639
01:09:52,491 --> 01:09:53,660
two,
two questions for him.

1640
01:09:53,661 --> 01:09:58,661
Like can you raise $300,000 within the
next three months and can you raise $1

1641
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,350
million by election day?
And you know,

1642
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,080
that was the whole of the conversation
and,

1643
01:10:03,081 --> 01:10:06,710
and it has to be based on more than
something,

1644
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,380
more than how much money can you raise
a,

1645
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,530
we have to do that.
There has to be another variable for

1646
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:14,510
picking leaders,
uh,

1647
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,860
beyond,
you know,

1648
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:18,350
how much cash can you get your hands on
in the next few months?

1649
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,540
Do you see that Rosie O'donnell got in
trouble for,

1650
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,700
uh,
raising money under various names and,

1651
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,870
and donating too much money.
It's like Roy,

1652
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,330
Roy Moore's a opponents and wow.
Yeah.

1653
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:32,730
What,
what exactly happened?

1654
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,760
I read that she had used a website that
she thought should have stopped her from

1655
01:10:38,251 --> 01:10:42,120
donating the extra amount cause it was
being divvied amongst many people and

1656
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:43,620
that it should have been returned to
her,

1657
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,140
which I s I don't know enough about it
that,

1658
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,740
uh,
candidates are supposed to return extra

1659
01:10:49,741 --> 01:10:52,650
funds once they've crossed over the
amount that a individual is supposed to

1660
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:55,290
give.
And it didn't happen in this,

1661
01:10:55,291 --> 01:10:57,600
these cases,
and it should have happened.

1662
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:59,580
And I don't know.
It doesn't,

1663
01:10:59,581 --> 01:11:02,030
she know how much you're supposed to
donate isn't there's free.

1664
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,110
That's what she was saying.
She's $2,700.

1665
01:11:04,111 --> 01:11:05,810
Right.
She used a website and she just gave him

1666
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:06,930
a shit load of money,
I think.

1667
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,730
Oh,
I see.

1668
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:11,370
But I thought she used different names.
I don't know about that part.

1669
01:11:11,371 --> 01:11:13,470
I didn't hear about that part.
We should probably that up.

1670
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:13,950
Yeah,
there were,

1671
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:14,160
that

1672
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,360
was one of the,
um,

1673
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,900
sort of stories that wasn't followed up
after 2016,

1674
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:20,910
but it was,
it was one of the things that came out

1675
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:23,100
in the,
in those hacked dnc,

1676
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,610
um,
uh,

1677
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,270
things was that there was,
uh,

1678
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,890
a little bit of a scam going on in terms
of,

1679
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,360
um,
you know,

1680
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,350
the,
as you see it,

1681
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:35,310
the individual donor living donation
limit is pretty small.

1682
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:37,920
It's like $2,700 for an individual.
So a couple,

1683
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:40,950
it's $5,400.
So what they would do is they would host

1684
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:43,230
these,
these dinners with celebrities,

1685
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:44,300
like,
you know,

1686
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,170
George Clooney and a bunch of his
friends.

1687
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,060
And,
uh,

1688
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:52,200
they would raise all this money and
theoretically the money was supposed to

1689
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:55,800
go only a tiny portion of it to the
presidential campaign and the rest of

1690
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:58,440
it's supposed to go to the regional
parties.

1691
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:01,950
But what was actually happening
according to politico anyway,

1692
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,520
a,
was that the money was basically going

1693
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:08,010
to the parties and then going
immediately back to the presidential

1694
01:12:08,011 --> 01:12:08,880
campaign.
And,

1695
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:09,990
and,
uh,

1696
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,890
they,
a lot of the people who gave the money

1697
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,090
didn't even know that that was happening
and

1698
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,760
they were upset about it.
And,

1699
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:17,390
uh,
and,

1700
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,460
but that was a story that wasn't
followed up after,

1701
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:21,260
after 2016.
Yeah.

1702
01:12:21,261 --> 01:12:23,420
There's just entirely too much money.
Yeah.

1703
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,890
Totally.
Too much money in politics.

1704
01:12:24,891 --> 01:12:26,780
But how would you ever do it without the
money?

1705
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,520
Now,
once the money's in,

1706
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,720
how do you pull it out?
How do you say no,

1707
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:31,041
no,
no,

1708
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:33,890
no more influence.
No more special interest groups.

1709
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,470
Lobbyists are illegal.
Yeah.

1710
01:12:36,471 --> 01:12:37,304
I mean,
I,

1711
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:42,320
I think they should,
they should probably have very brief,

1712
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:45,230
publicly funded elections where

1713
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:46,340
there's a,
you know,

1714
01:12:46,341 --> 01:12:49,880
the,
the course of time is maybe five weeks.

1715
01:12:49,881 --> 01:12:50,691
And what,
Oh,

1716
01:12:50,691 --> 01:12:51,890
is this assists the O'donnell thing?

1717
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,561
Yeah.
It says,

1718
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:55,470
Hell Donald Doty donated $4,700 to a
bomb.

1719
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:57,390
Uh,
Alabama Senator Doug Jones.

1720
01:12:57,391 --> 01:12:59,190
And His special action against Roy
Moore,

1721
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,520
$3,600 to Pennsylvania Rep conard lamb
for the special general electric.

1722
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:10,460
He won in March,
2000 952 California Rep Adam Schiff for

1723
01:13:10,981 --> 01:13:14,310
his primary $4,200 to Illinois
congressional candidate,

1724
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:19,311
Lauren Underwood for her primary run in
3,404 52 oh Omar Vade,

1725
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:22,590
a congressional candidate in Staten
Island and Brooklyn.

1726
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,770
Nothing nefarious.
She's Rosie O'donnell says I was not

1727
01:13:25,771 --> 01:13:29,490
choosing to over donate the $2,700
cutoff,

1728
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,980
uh,
candidates she'd prefer refund the

1729
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:33,360
money.
She wrote a,

1730
01:13:33,361 --> 01:13:35,790
I don't look to see who I can donate
most too.

1731
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:39,060
I just donate assuming they do not
accept what is over the limit.

1732
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,680
Hmm.
Right.

1733
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,160
Yeah.
I Dunno how

1734
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,600
I am by that explanation,
but uh,

1735
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,450
it doesn't really matter because the
reality is

1736
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,040
there are million ways that you can
legally give money to campaigns now that

1737
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:58,990
don't involve just the individual
donation.

1738
01:13:58,991 --> 01:14:00,030
Like you can,
you know,

1739
01:14:00,031 --> 01:14:03,040
you can give money to a foundation or a,
you know,

1740
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:07,840
a five o one c three or whatever it is
that buys an ad,

1741
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,060
uh,
that will help the candidate just as

1742
01:14:10,061 --> 01:14:12,070
much as the you as,
as it would

1743
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,930
if you don't do I need to directly.
So,

1744
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,060
you know,
in the post citizens United Universe,

1745
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,760
this is this,
this is a,

1746
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:20,140
it's a story,
but you know,

1747
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:25,141
the bigger story is that you can base
the very rich people and companies can

1748
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:27,490
basically spend unlimited amounts of
money on,

1749
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,080
on campaigns.
And yeah,

1750
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:30,340
this is,
this whole story is over.

1751
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:33,820
Like what was that all told for $5,000
most?

1752
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,410
Yeah.
Not a lot.

1753
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,273
No,
I don't,

1754
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:37,930
that doesn't,
I mean,

1755
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:39,980
you know,
I don't have feelings one way or another

1756
01:14:39,981 --> 01:14:41,500
about Rosie O'donnell,
but not,

1757
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,260
I,
that doesn't make me outraged terribly.

1758
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:45,460
Well,
trump hates her.

1759
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,650
Right.
What's fascinating about it at all?

1760
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:48,790
Yeah.
Well he,

1761
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:49,870
he,
he,

1762
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,500
he got a big bump from talking about her
in the debate and you know,

1763
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:55,360
that,
that was another thing that he did very

1764
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:59,770
early on as he clued into the fact that
people hate people hate journalists and

1765
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:00,850
they,
Hollywood actors.

1766
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:04,780
And so he made,
he made sure as much as possible to talk

1767
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:05,860
about,
uh,

1768
01:15:05,861 --> 01:15:07,030
all the,
all the groups,

1769
01:15:07,031 --> 01:15:08,770
the major food groups of,
of,

1770
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,780
of hate in America,
right?

1771
01:15:10,781 --> 01:15:13,180
Like immigrants,
Hillary Clinton,

1772
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:17,350
Hollywood actors and reporters.
And those were the staples of his

1773
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,041
routine.
And,

1774
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:19,630
and,
uh,

1775
01:15:19,631 --> 01:15:20,530
it worked.
I mean,

1776
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,690
it was,
it was smart on his part.

1777
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,930
Uh,
I think particularly the targeting of

1778
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:30,931
journalists was brilliant because he was
able to portray us as the wealthy elite.

1779
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:32,381
And,
you know,

1780
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:34,720
he's the billionaire.
Uh,

1781
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,060
but he's pointing the finger at us as
I'll look to,

1782
01:15:37,061 --> 01:15:39,100
you know,
they're the guardians of,

1783
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:41,090
of rich America,
which,

1784
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,360
which worked and what wasn't brilliant
thing.

1785
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,633
It's just,
um,

1786
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,040
it's unprecedented.
Yeah.

1787
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:51,060
What was the last time any presidential
among maybe Nixon complained about them

1788
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:53,110
at the time,
but I believe it was privately.

1789
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:54,740
Yeah.
Well he,

1790
01:15:54,741 --> 01:15:57,310
he,
he hated the press pretty openly.

1791
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:00,430
I mean,
he had that 1962 press conference where

1792
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,170
he's like,
you won't have Nixon to kick around

1793
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:04,300
anymore.
Uh,

1794
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:05,740
and,
uh,

1795
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:10,741
he from all accounts,
he was an incredibly profane,

1796
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:14,620
nasty person in private,
and he only talked to a few reporters.

1797
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:16,300
Um,
I mean,

1798
01:16:16,301 --> 01:16:18,970
I think all politicians hate reporters
if they,

1799
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:20,800
if they don't,
uh,

1800
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:22,870
there's probably something wrong with
them because,

1801
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:24,700
you know,
the press corps in most cases is,

1802
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:27,130
is really is out to get them,
um,

1803
01:16:27,131 --> 01:16:29,650
or at least as dangerous,
you know.

1804
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,710
Uh,
but with trump and Nixon,

1805
01:16:32,711 --> 01:16:34,420
it was,
it went to a whole new level and,

1806
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,390
and went to a paranoid place and,
um,

1807
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:39,580
you know,
but on the other hand,

1808
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:40,780
I don't mean to bore you with this,
but,

1809
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:43,990
but the,
the whining about being kicked out of

1810
01:16:43,991 --> 01:16:46,620
the White House and not being able to
fly with,

1811
01:16:46,621 --> 01:16:50,920
with trump and,
and the sort of separation between the

1812
01:16:50,921 --> 01:16:53,890
president and the press corps and the
fact he doesn't show up at the White

1813
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,920
House correspondence dinner,
like as a reporter,

1814
01:16:56,921 --> 01:16:58,300
I,
my response to that is,

1815
01:16:58,301 --> 01:17:00,700
so what we should be on the outside.

1816
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,600
You know,
like,

1817
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:02,500
I,
I don't,

1818
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:05,770
I don't shed a tear about that.
I think it's very strange the response

1819
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:06,950
in our business that,
uh,

1820
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:07,631
oh,
you know,

1821
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:08,260
we're,
we're not,

1822
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:10,430
we don't get to be hanging around with
the president and,

1823
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,870
and,
uh,

1824
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,940
you know,
pal around behind the rope line with

1825
01:17:13,941 --> 01:17:15,270
them anymore.
Like we,

1826
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:18,110
we should be adversarial I think.
Yeah.

1827
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:20,180
Well if as long as you're honest and
accurate.

1828
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:21,140
Yeah,
yeah.

1829
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,033
I mean,
did you,

1830
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:24,170
I mean,
not even adversarial,

1831
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:25,770
but not connected,
right,

1832
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:26,620
right.
It's,

1833
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:28,820
it's,
it's a kind of a separation of church

1834
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:31,880
and state thing for me.
Like I had an experience when I,

1835
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:36,530
when I covered the Obama campaign and I
like Barack Obama as a candidate in

1836
01:17:36,531 --> 01:17:39,320
2008.
I was really impressed by him.

1837
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:43,820
But I remember going into the plane the
first time going back into the press

1838
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:46,610
section and I see that there's photos
all over the walls of the,

1839
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:48,710
of the campaign plane.

1840
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,040
And apparently there's a tradition where
each of the reporters had like a little

1841
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:57,590
sort of high school yearbook photo taken
with the candidate where,

1842
01:17:57,591 --> 01:18:00,590
you know,
they got their arm around a Obama and

1843
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:03,050
they're posing.
And it was a tradition to kind of put

1844
01:18:03,051 --> 01:18:05,960
the photo up on the wall.
Uh,

1845
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:07,360
and I'm like,
you know,

1846
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:09,680
this is not a good look for the press
corps.

1847
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:14,540
Even if you like the guy,
you got to at least pretend to have a

1848
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:16,580
little bit of that.
The mode is supposed to be there.

1849
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:17,410
You know what I mean?
What's,

1850
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:20,230
this is certainly influential.
Yes.

1851
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,520
Certainly going to have some sort of an
influence on you.

1852
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:23,361
Yeah.
Yeah.

1853
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:25,910
It's just a bad look.
Like what happens if you do a story

1854
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:28,430
about the guy that's complimentary and
it comes out that,

1855
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:29,683
you know,
you're,

1856
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,330
you're,
you've put a picture of yourself with

1857
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:33,320
your arm around the guy.

1858
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,330
You know what I mean?
It's just,

1859
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,850
that's,
reporters are kind of supposed to be

1860
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:40,850
these unpleasant,
uh,

1861
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,300
you know,
kind of grumpy people who instantly

1862
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:47,390
deface the posters of,
you know,

1863
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,710
powerful people.
Uh,

1864
01:18:48,711 --> 01:18:49,311
you know,
when,

1865
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:52,640
whenever they get a chance and throw
darts at pictures of them and stuff like

1866
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:53,240
that,
like that,

1867
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:57,770
that's who they kind of used to be.
And you see there's people that are

1868
01:18:57,771 --> 01:19:01,010
jockeying for position to potentially
run in.

1869
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:02,690
You know,
the next election,

1870
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:07,520
obviously the 2018 elections,
but in 2020 for president,

1871
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,680
he seen people that are moving into
position.

1872
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:13,040
You see these congressional candidates
that are showing promise.

1873
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,390
Like what,
what is the,

1874
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,650
when you're covering this,
so like,

1875
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:18,170
what's the,
what's the feeling of like the future

1876
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:22,010
from these races?
So like,

1877
01:19:22,011 --> 01:19:24,480
what is it from the standpoint of
reporters like when like,

1878
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:26,120
yeah,
well first,

1879
01:19:26,121 --> 01:19:27,370
first of all,
like the,

1880
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:32,380
the holy grail of reporting is to latch
onto a politician before they become

1881
01:19:33,171 --> 01:19:36,830
famous and before they become president
and follow them all the way.

1882
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:41,270
And that way you get to be the insider
who gets invited into the Oval Office.

1883
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:43,160
So it's,
it's like,

1884
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:46,040
uh,
it's a big thing that a lot of reporters

1885
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:51,041
kind of dream of his to his,
to latch on early to somebody like Bill

1886
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,881
Clinton,
uh,

1887
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:57,080
and become the,
the sort of favored reporter on that

1888
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:58,640
beat.
Um,

1889
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,970
that's why at the outset of presidential
elections,

1890
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:05,450
you'll often see a lot of jockeying
within newsrooms to see who gets to

1891
01:20:05,451 --> 01:20:07,250
cover which campaign.
Because,

1892
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,810
um,
people always want to pick the winner

1893
01:20:09,811 --> 01:20:12,790
because they think they're going to get
a book deal out of it at the end and

1894
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:16,320
you're going to end up having their own
show on MSNBC or whatever.

1895
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,450
But the,
um,

1896
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,720
but yeah,
I mean the w w what's the feeling right

1897
01:20:21,721 --> 01:20:24,270
now?
Like who are people coalescing around?

1898
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,600
Um,
is that what you're asking that too?

1899
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:28,200
Yeah.

1900
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,190
Uh,
well,

1901
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:33,660
I think there's,
the expectation is that some of the same

1902
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:35,250
people are going to be involved.
I think there's,

1903
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:38,280
there's a lot of belief that Bernie's
going to run again.

1904
01:20:38,281 --> 01:20:40,530
But then there's also a Kamala Harris,
there's,

1905
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,510
uh,
cory booker.

1906
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,920
Um,
you know,

1907
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:45,390
people believe that those,
those,

1908
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:48,420
those folks are gonna run.
Um,

1909
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:49,660
but,
uh,

1910
01:20:49,661 --> 01:20:51,090
it,
oddly enough,

1911
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:55,950
the press corps is less focused on that
than they would be normally.

1912
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,980
Uh,
I think they're the only story that

1913
01:20:58,981 --> 01:21:02,400
matters to political reporters right now
as the Russia gate trump thing.

1914
01:21:02,401 --> 01:21:06,090
And they're following that and kind of
hoping that will be some,

1915
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:08,280
the thing that happens instead of the
20,

1916
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:09,660
20 election,
you know,

1917
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:12,720
that they're there.
The big,

1918
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,920
the big sort of trial of Donald Trump is
what everybody's kind of waiting for.

1919
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:19,410
Well,
the recent take on that is that there is

1920
01:21:19,411 --> 01:21:22,290
some sort of a connection between
Russian oligarchs and Michael Cohen.

1921
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:26,340
Right.
There's something that he moved the Vec

1922
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,600
Vekselberg uh,
payment.

1923
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:31,830
I just heard about that this morning.
So I can't say that I know a whole lot

1924
01:21:31,831 --> 01:21:33,510
about that.
Um,

1925
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,790
what would that payment before?
When was it?

1926
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,950
You know,
it was allegedly after the elections,

1927
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:40,200
so that would be a story.
I mean,

1928
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,073
I,
I,

1929
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:44,310
I've gotten a lot of criticism because I
had been a little bit of a skeptic on

1930
01:21:44,311 --> 01:21:46,050
the Russia Gate Front.
Um,

1931
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:49,050
not so much that I don't believe it,
but I just kind of think the press

1932
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:51,160
should be a little careful about it.
Uh,

1933
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,700
but if that's true,
yeah.

1934
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:54,690
She,
that's a big story.

1935
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:56,730
If,
if Cohen really was in Prague,

1936
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,650
that's also a really big story.
Um,

1937
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,330
you know,
but we'll have to see what those,

1938
01:22:00,331 --> 01:22:01,830
what,
what really comes out of that.

1939
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:05,790
It's just such an unusual moment in
history.

1940
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:06,780
Oh yeah.

1941
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:08,640
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

1942
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:10,220
You know what I mean?
It's,

1943
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:15,420
it's the,
as unstable as American history's been

1944
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:16,770
in our lifetime,
certainly.

1945
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:18,240
Right.
I would think,

1946
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:19,320
you know,
he ever,

1947
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,910
yeah.
Or close to it.

1948
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:22,590
Right?
The civil war on,

1949
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,670
yeah.
Yeah.

1950
01:22:23,671 --> 01:22:28,290
I mean,
if you add in the fact that we've had

1951
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:32,370
concerns about nuclear conflict with two
different nations,

1952
01:22:32,371 --> 01:22:33,031
right.
And since,

1953
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,190
since trump has been elected,
I mean there's,

1954
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:39,600
there's the North Korea thing and then
there's the fact that we've had military

1955
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:42,620
exchanges where Russian mercenaries,
uh,

1956
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,400
you know,
reportedly have died.

1957
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,400
Um,
you know,

1958
01:22:46,401 --> 01:22:49,470
they,
that's certainly unnerving.

1959
01:22:49,471 --> 01:22:50,041
You know,
the,

1960
01:22:50,041 --> 01:22:51,990
the,
the nuclear clock,

1961
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:54,360
which was established,
the doomsday clock,

1962
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:56,250
which was established way back in the
fifties,

1963
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,110
um,
has us at the,

1964
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:03,270
the most dangerous points since 1953.
I'm merely,

1965
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:03,930
yeah,
yeah,

1966
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:05,210
yeah.
And,

1967
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:06,463
uh,
at a,

1968
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:10,440
at a time in their estimation,
I forget what the,

1969
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:12,250
the,
the organization is actually called,

1970
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:13,780
but,
um,

1971
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,330
uh,
I think it's physicians for social

1972
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:17,200
responsibility.

1973
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:19,390
Uh,
but the,

1974
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:20,403
you know,
the,

1975
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:23,210
this right now is more dangerous than,
you know,

1976
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:26,020
the,
the k seven shooting the Cuban missile

1977
01:23:26,021 --> 01:23:26,920
crisis.
Like,

1978
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:30,010
we're,
we're at a a moment that's incredibly

1979
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:33,760
tense between these two countries and
more so than the Cuban missile crisis in

1980
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:35,050
their estimation.
Yeah.

1981
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:38,110
Who's estimating this there?
It's called the doomsday clock.

1982
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:42,450
You can find it as a metric.
Just the,

1983
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:43,930
the,
you know,

1984
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,090
I guess they're just reading the news
like everybody else,

1985
01:23:46,091 --> 01:23:47,170
but,
um,

1986
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:48,140
you know,
they,

1987
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,940
uh,
I don't know it,

1988
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:53,680
it's off derided by,
uh,

1989
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:57,010
by people in Washington has been
Washington as being too hysterical.

1990
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,960
Um,
but you know,

1991
01:23:58,961 --> 01:23:59,410
it,
it,

1992
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,330
it is an indicator.
Uh,

1993
01:24:01,331 --> 01:24:02,830
and,
uh,

1994
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,820
the people who,
um,

1995
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,100
who do it,
uh,

1996
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:10,300
I think are the same people who want to
win Nobel prize last year for,

1997
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,850
um,
the sort of anti nuclear,

1998
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:14,160
uh,
the,

1999
01:24:14,161 --> 01:24:15,950
the UN ban,
uh,

2000
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,290
on,
on nuclear weapons.

2001
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:21,670
So [inaudible] nine 11,
we used to have a terrorist threat

2002
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:22,840
colors.
Yeah.

2003
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,300
Yeah.
Robert Mueller was on the board,

2004
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:26,550
uh,
the,

2005
01:24:26,551 --> 01:24:31,551
the,
every day they used to have a meeting of

2006
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:36,130
a group of people in the various
intelligence agencies to decide what the

2007
01:24:36,131 --> 01:24:38,320
color would be,
um,

2008
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:40,150
as a yellow.
Yeah,

2009
01:24:40,151 --> 01:24:40,951
exactly.
And what,

2010
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:44,650
what's fascinating about this tonight,
I only heard about this cause I wrote

2011
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:49,651
about this a few months ago and I made a
mistake by saying that it,

2012
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,820
the,
the,

2013
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,030
uh,
the color used to toggle between red,

2014
01:24:55,031 --> 01:24:58,090
which was the highest and green,
which was the lowest,

2015
01:24:58,091 --> 01:25:00,280
but apparently not once in its entire
history.

2016
01:25:00,281 --> 01:25:02,250
Was it ever green?
Like the,

2017
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,690
the,
they never had threat level low,

2018
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:07,510
even won a once in its history.
So we were,

2019
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,850
oh,
we were always at some level of anxiety.

2020
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:11,920
But those,
those are weird times to remember that

2021
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:14,470
when they used to kind of tell us how
scared we were supposed to be about

2022
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:15,640
about stuff.

2023
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:20,110
And with a real simple distinction like
colors,

2024
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,040
right?
Yeah.

2025
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,630
Today's orange.
Holy Shit.

2026
01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:24,160
It's orange dude.
Be careful.

2027
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:26,140
You're going to fly today.
That's more,

2028
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,030
yeah.
Are you going to go to an airport today?

2029
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,370
It's orange.
I'm not going to the superbowl.

2030
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:32,180
Today's orange.
Yeah.

2031
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,300
Crazy stuff to read.
Oh yeah,

2032
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,560
I think so.
It had to have a,

2033
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:39,670
and then they just stopped.
Right?

2034
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:40,420
Well,
so the,

2035
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,560
the,
the program,

2036
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,770
uh,
it took a huge hit when,

2037
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:47,890
um,
one of the guys who was involved who was

2038
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:52,720
the former head of homeland security,
if I'm not mistaken,

2039
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:58,650
came out with a story that he had been
told by some of the Bush people to Jack

2040
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,660
up the,
uh,

2041
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:06,720
the color in advance of an election.
Uh,

2042
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,780
and,
um,

2043
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:13,010
it was shortly after that story came out
that they discontinued the program.

2044
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,880
Uh,
it came out in the book by,

2045
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:17,570
by the former head of the homeland
security,

2046
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:21,220
right before an election.
There were told time to go orange.

2047
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,190
Yeah,
exactly.

2048
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:22,941
Yeah.
Yeah.

2049
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:24,850
Because they wanted to build up.
Right.

2050
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,180
I mean,
it was this,

2051
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,420
you get people scared and they'll vote,
vote a certain way.

2052
01:26:29,421 --> 01:26:31,010
And Yeah.
So,

2053
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:33,200
yeah.
Amazing Times though.

2054
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:34,573
Yeah.

2055
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:37,780
As a journalist,
do you look at these times and say,

2056
01:26:37,781 --> 01:26:39,910
this is great,
this is great for business,

2057
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:44,050
or do you,
do you more so look at it as a human

2058
01:26:44,051 --> 01:26:46,810
being and go,
this is just a fucking mess.

2059
01:26:46,811 --> 01:26:50,160
And I wish we weren't so ridiculous.
So when,

2060
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:53,030
when I first started covering the trump
campaign,

2061
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:56,390
I thought this is the most awesome thing
ever because,

2062
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,070
uh,
uh,

2063
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,510
eh,
that dynamic I was talking about before

2064
01:27:00,511 --> 01:27:02,450
about,
about reporters wanting to be on the

2065
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:04,430
ground floor with,
with the future winner.

2066
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,680
Um,
nobody wanted to be on the trump

2067
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:08,900
campaign because nobody thought he was
going to win.

2068
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:14,200
I was stoked to the assigned to cover
trump because I thought this is the most

2069
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:16,490
insane thing ever.
And He,

2070
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,990
you know,
maybe you can fit your style of

2071
01:27:17,991 --> 01:27:18,771
journalism.
Yeah,

2072
01:27:18,771 --> 01:27:20,180
exactly.
I thought this is,

2073
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:24,020
this is the black comedy that I was then
I was sort of born to cover and born,

2074
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:26,690
born to write.
And for the first,

2075
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:29,420
I dunno,
five or six things that I wrote about

2076
01:27:29,421 --> 01:27:29,750
it,
I,

2077
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,460
um,
about trump,

2078
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:33,890
I thought it was the most amazing,
crazy,

2079
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:36,020
interesting story of my lifetime.

2080
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:39,050
And then it took this incredibly dark
term where he actually won.

2081
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,210
And,
um,

2082
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:44,270
I think it was a dark term for him too.
Yeah.

2083
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:46,420
There's no question about it.
There's no,

2084
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:49,520
I mean I knew some of the people in his
campaign,

2085
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:52,460
I can't say this definitively,
but I,

2086
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:55,820
but I,
I have a very good educated guests that

2087
01:27:55,821 --> 01:27:59,420
they had absolutely no expectation of it
ever even been close,

2088
01:27:59,421 --> 01:28:03,440
let alone winning and that and that
they,

2089
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:08,210
uh,
that they did this as a publicity stunt

2090
01:28:08,211 --> 01:28:11,390
in the beginning,
probably with the aim of either creating

2091
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:16,391
a media network or just bolstering
trump's overall q rating or whatever it

2092
01:28:16,761 --> 01:28:17,594
was.

2093
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,960
NBC might've pushed him towards the
presidency by firing him from the

2094
01:28:22,961 --> 01:28:23,620
apprentice.
Uh,

2095
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:25,960
yeah,
cause he was still the host of that

2096
01:28:25,961 --> 01:28:28,720
fucking show while he was running for
president.

2097
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:32,140
They fire him and then arnold takes
over.

2098
01:28:32,141 --> 01:28:36,250
People forgot already and Arnold
Schwartzenegger with for a very short

2099
01:28:36,251 --> 01:28:37,740
time.
You're fired.

2100
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,540
You're fired.
You're fired.

2101
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,250
He was the guy for a while.
Yeah.

2102
01:28:42,251 --> 01:28:43,660
They had that flame war,
remember?

2103
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:45,430
Yeah.
It was really weird.

2104
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:47,560
Yeah.
Fucking strange.

2105
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,740
But NBC might have given him the final,
you know,

2106
01:28:50,741 --> 01:28:53,420
you might have taken an extra diet pill
that day and went,

2107
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,630
fuck it.
We're going all in the wall.

2108
01:28:55,631 --> 01:28:59,860
Got 10 feet higher
on Swartz.

2109
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:02,010
Bigger says he's done with apprentice
blames

2110
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,500
poor ratings on trump involvement.
Oh,

2111
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,870
that's hilarious.
That's right.

2112
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:08,490
Yeah.
They had that whole back and forth over

2113
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:10,900
who was to blame for the ratings.
But uh,

2114
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:14,550
listen,
as a host of that show,

2115
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,680
Donald Trump was crate.
Oh yeah,

2116
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:18,540
he's the perfect guys.
The whole statue.

2117
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,570
Arnold's too nice.
It's not the right guy.

2118
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:23,330
He's not a billionaire asshole.
Yeah,

2119
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:26,880
no,
you need a total jackass and,

2120
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:29,010
and get it done.
One of those guys,

2121
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:30,780
you need one of those guys.
You got fired.

2122
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:32,160
And the,
the,

2123
01:29:32,161 --> 01:29:36,510
the same thing that made trump perfect
for that show made him perfect as the

2124
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:41,340
main protagonist in campaign coverage,
which is actually really just a really

2125
01:29:41,341 --> 01:29:45,270
long super boring reality show,
or at least it used to be until trump

2126
01:29:45,271 --> 01:29:46,620
came along.
Uh,

2127
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:48,750
trump completely changed the dynamic of
it.

2128
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:49,783
You know,
if you're,

2129
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,350
if you're thinking of it in terms of how
it looks to a network,

2130
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,990
what were the networks thinking before?

2131
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:56,730
If they,
if they were going to have people like

2132
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:59,820
Scott Walker and Lindsey Graham be the
stars of,

2133
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:01,890
of their lead reality show.
Like,

2134
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:04,980
let's get a real performer in there.
Right?

2135
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:06,300
And,
and when they did,

2136
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,530
when they,
when,

2137
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,890
when trump entered the fray and became a
real candidate and started getting

2138
01:30:10,891 --> 01:30:14,650
votes,
suddenly news started making money and

2139
01:30:14,651 --> 01:30:17,160
like for like real money for the first
time.

2140
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:20,490
And there a,
there's an amazing data point right now,

2141
01:30:20,491 --> 01:30:24,780
which is that the public trusts the
press less than ever,

2142
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,000
right?
They believe the things that we say less

2143
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:28,530
than ever,
all the polls show this,

2144
01:30:28,531 --> 01:30:32,550
that there's been a dramatic downturn
and how much people will put stock in

2145
01:30:32,551 --> 01:30:34,680
and things that people like me say,
right?

2146
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:37,680
Uh,
but they're watching television,

2147
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:40,710
television news more than they ever have
by a lot.

2148
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,200
So what are those two data points say
together,

2149
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:46,260
put together that people are consuming
news not as news,

2150
01:30:46,261 --> 01:30:47,860
but it's entertainment there.

2151
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,950
There,
there are watching it more,

2152
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,180
right?
So we're,

2153
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,040
we've,
you know,

2154
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:56,070
CNN made over $1 billion last year.
They're just eating into the

2155
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:57,360
entertainment budget.
That's,

2156
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,610
that's all they're doing.
And it's all trump.

2157
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,990
Uh,
which is,

2158
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:04,020
is fascinating and kind of horrifying,
but,

2159
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,990
but really interesting too.
Isn't that also what he played upon when

2160
01:31:06,991 --> 01:31:09,240
he was running,
like he would say outrageous shit.

2161
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:11,310
So they would cover him.
And that essentially gave him free

2162
01:31:11,311 --> 01:31:12,150
press.
Oh,

2163
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,440
absolutely.
Yeah.

2164
01:31:13,441 --> 01:31:15,630
And He,
there was no doubt in my mind that,

2165
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:20,660
that he was doing that intentionally.
I remember watching him and I'm in New

2166
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:26,210
Hampshire where he's giving a speech and
you probably remember this,

2167
01:31:26,211 --> 01:31:28,630
this woman stood up and said,
ted Cruz,

2168
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:29,940
the pussy.
All right.

2169
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:31,720
And,
uh,

2170
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:36,450
and trump looks over at her and he says,
oh,

2171
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:37,650
that's terrible.
That's terrible.

2172
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:39,480
She just had a terrible thing about Ted
Cruz.

2173
01:31:39,481 --> 01:31:39,870
Right.

2174
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:43,860
And I remember,
I remember him looking over at the,

2175
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,720
at the rise of where all the cameras
are,

2176
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:50,370
and you could see him thinking,
he's thinking it's a story for six

2177
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,590
hours.
If she says it,

2178
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:53,820
it's a story for three days.
That's why I say it.

2179
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:54,853
Right.
Right.

2180
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,340
And he,
he thinks,

2181
01:31:56,341 --> 01:31:59,490
and he goes,
he just said that Ted Cruz is a pussy a

2182
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,610
right.
And next thing you know,

2183
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:02,330
it like completely dominated the news.
And,

2184
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,630
and he,
he comes,

2185
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:07,840
he understood the dynamic of how the
news works better than,

2186
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:10,210
than even the people in the news
understood it.

2187
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,890
Well,
certainly better than Ted Cruz,

2188
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:14,020
that's for sure.
Ted Cruz,

2189
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:18,700
that the recent praise of trump,
and then they go back to like what he

2190
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:20,750
said during the campaign.
Oh my God.

2191
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:24,490
It's no one should ever listen to him
ever again about anything.

2192
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:25,510
Oh yeah,
no,

2193
01:32:25,511 --> 01:32:26,340
it was a,
it was,

2194
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:27,430
it's hilarious.

2195
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:30,010
Ted Cruz,
you know,

2196
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:32,590
first of all,
my favorite part of that whole campaign

2197
01:32:32,591 --> 01:32:35,410
was the thing that he couldn't shake
about being the Zodiac killer.

2198
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:36,790
Like,
uh,

2199
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:40,420
and,
and reporters would give him shit about

2200
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:41,254
it.
Like,

2201
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,170
like we would talk amongst each other,
like,

2202
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:45,550
who's going to ask him about it the
next,

2203
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:46,080
you know,
and,

2204
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:46,930
and,
um,

2205
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:49,600
and everybody knew that it was,
it was bullshit.

2206
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:51,260
You know,
that he was born after the killing

2207
01:32:51,261 --> 01:32:52,810
started and everything,
all that stuff.

2208
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:55,240
But somebody would always make it a
point to say,

2209
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:57,040
so what do you think about the,
you know,

2210
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:59,860
the rumors about,
and you could see that it just,

2211
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:02,410
it completely drove him to distraction.
He didn't know how to,

2212
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:04,660
how to make a joke out of it or,
yeah.

2213
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:06,440
Well,
I know you're a hunter s thompson fancy.

2214
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:09,400
You were probably aware of what a hunter
did to Ed Muskie.

2215
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,600
Oh yeah.
The IBOGAINE.

2216
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,910
Yeah,
absolutely.

2217
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,820
He went crazy.
Literally went crazy.

2218
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:17,033
A hunter.
It was,

2219
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:20,590
what was it on the Dick Cavett show that
he talked about it?

2220
01:33:20,591 --> 01:33:23,590
Well,
there was a rumor he had,

2221
01:33:23,591 --> 01:33:25,300
uh,
taken Ibogaine and,

2222
01:33:25,301 --> 01:33:27,100
uh,
I knew about that rumor because I

2223
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:27,934
started it.

2224
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,440
He drove that guy crazy to the point
where you see,

2225
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:38,830
I think it was in New Hampshire,
he was giving a political campaign

2226
01:33:38,831 --> 01:33:40,580
speech and he broke down.
Yeah.

2227
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:41,453
Oh yeah.
He cried.

2228
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,910
Yeah.
Well he,

2229
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,730
so hundreds of this great thing.
He,

2230
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:48,310
he,
he wrote about it.

2231
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:50,410
It was,
it was kind of a spoof of campaign

2232
01:33:50,411 --> 01:33:52,600
coverage because he,
he,

2233
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,730
he did this whole,
uh,

2234
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:58,540
campaign diary and then he just kind of
went into this dead Pan,

2235
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:04,080
a recitation of what sounded like a
breaking news story about him

2236
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:06,390
discovering,
uh,

2237
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:10,250
muskies secret relationship with a witch
doctor who was providing him with it

2238
01:34:10,251 --> 01:34:11,050
will gain.
And then,

2239
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:11,690
then,
then he,

2240
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:16,270
he dug up some file photo of Musky that
look like this.

2241
01:34:16,271 --> 01:34:19,590
It was like,
and he,

2242
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:20,940
they put,
you know,

2243
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:23,320
must ed Musky in the grips of an Igbo
gain.

2244
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:27,350
Frenzy was the caption and a,
it was completely dead pan.

2245
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:28,960
He never said he was kidding.
I've never seen that.

2246
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:30,100
Never said it was,
you know,

2247
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:34,660
not like that was fiction and uh,
and Musky couldn't handle it.

2248
01:34:34,661 --> 01:34:38,350
I mean,
that was probably the first real

2249
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,510
political trolling that went on.
But,

2250
01:34:40,511 --> 01:34:42,040
uh,
and a brilliant one too,

2251
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:45,130
because I began,
it's not even in that kind of a drug.

2252
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,320
It's a drug that helps people get off
drugs,

2253
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,570
oddly enough.
Illegal,

2254
01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:50,300
right?
Uh,

2255
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:51,310
yeah.
In America,

2256
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,320
in America.
It's legal in a lot of places,

2257
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:55,570
but it's really great for people getting
off opiates.

2258
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:58,820
Huh.
It's it just a ferociously introspective

2259
01:34:58,821 --> 01:35:03,410
drug that rewires the way your brain
deals with addictions.

2260
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:08,090
It literally rewires the connections,
alleviates addictions on a physical and

2261
01:35:08,091 --> 01:35:09,860
psychological level.
What's the,

2262
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,640
what does it feel like?
I don't know.

2263
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:15,410
I haven't done,
I haven't done it on that one.

2264
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,110
Yeah.
I know quite a few people that have,

2265
01:35:18,111 --> 01:35:23,111
that have had pill problems,
have gone to Mexico and taking my friend

2266
01:35:23,421 --> 01:35:26,240
Ed Clay,
who has an actual center down there now,

2267
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:28,650
he started it,
uh,

2268
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,530
after he had gone down there for
treatment,

2269
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:32,030
he had a back injury,
I believe it was,

2270
01:35:32,031 --> 01:35:34,340
and got hooked on pills and I was like,
Jesus,

2271
01:35:34,341 --> 01:35:37,460
I got to figure out a way to get off
these fucking things and did Ibogaine

2272
01:35:37,461 --> 01:35:38,960
and then cleared it right up.

2273
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:40,220
Wow.
You realize like,

2274
01:35:40,221 --> 01:35:41,780
wow,
like this is,

2275
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:43,580
this is crazy,
that this is illegal.

2276
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:48,890
So the one drug that hunter chose was
actually a drug that gets people off

2277
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:51,230
drugs.
It just even more ironic.

2278
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:52,700
It just had a great name.
Yeah.

2279
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:54,360
Yeah.
And doctor,

2280
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:57,770
Bro.
It's fucking awesome.

2281
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:01,160
So that,
that really was the original political

2282
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:02,100
troll.
Yeah.

2283
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,190
Yeah.
And it might have had a giant effect in

2284
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:05,900
the election.
Probably did.

2285
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,430
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

2286
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:11,480
Um,
and I don't think it was an accident

2287
01:36:11,481 --> 01:36:15,890
that
hunter's coverage was,

2288
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:16,370
you know,
that,

2289
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:20,150
that he,
he chose that year to do these diaries.

2290
01:36:20,151 --> 01:36:22,970
And I remember my father telling me
about however report or would,

2291
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,910
would wait for rolling stone to come out
that week so they could,

2292
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:28,730
you know,
read the coverage of the election.

2293
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:30,280
But,
you know,

2294
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:32,270
hunter kind of,
uh,

2295
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:36,140
took this unknown unknown senator,
uh,

2296
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,720
from the Dakotas,
George Mcgovern and made them into this,

2297
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:42,680
uh,
because this like Christ figure

2298
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:43,543
basically.

2299
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:45,980
And I don't,
I don't think that mcgovern would have

2300
01:36:45,981 --> 01:36:49,310
won the nomination without,
without that sort of relentless hyping

2301
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:52,220
that he gave him because it probably
would have won the presidency if it

2302
01:36:52,221 --> 01:36:54,900
wasn't for the vice president having
that issue with,

2303
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,040
he had gone through electroshock
therapy.

2304
01:36:58,041 --> 01:36:59,770
Eagleton right.
Yeah,

2305
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:00,890
yeah,
yeah.

2306
01:37:00,891 --> 01:37:02,570
That was a,
that was terrible.

2307
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:03,770
But,
uh,

2308
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:05,130
but fascinating.
You know,

2309
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:07,640
I,
I got to write the introduction to the,

2310
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,860
to the last,
um,

2311
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:11,990
last version of that book.
And,

2312
01:37:11,991 --> 01:37:13,940
um,
that's one of my favorite books of all

2313
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:15,440
time.
Great fucking book.

2314
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:16,310
Yeah.
I mean,

2315
01:37:16,311 --> 01:37:20,030
it's just like a,
it's such a crazy economic ethic,

2316
01:37:20,031 --> 01:37:23,000
you know,
he was a big influence of yours.

2317
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:24,470
Uh,
yeah.

2318
01:37:24,490 --> 01:37:25,323
You know,
I,

2319
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:29,210
um,
definitely I think the,

2320
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:33,050
the great thing of a Hunter Thompson,
um,

2321
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:35,060
first of all,
he just,

2322
01:37:35,570 --> 01:37:39,890
he was so incredibly funny in a way that
was completely rare.

2323
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:40,271
I mean,
you,

2324
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:45,271
you can't just trained to be that way.
You either are born with that ability,

2325
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,960
uh,
verbally or not.

2326
01:37:47,961 --> 01:37:52,160
And he just had this completely strange
four dimensional way of looking at

2327
01:37:52,161 --> 01:37:52,994
things.
And,

2328
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,200
uh,
you know,

2329
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:58,770
he would,
he would a completely boring a campaign

2330
01:37:58,771 --> 01:38:02,700
speech.
And when he got done writing it up,

2331
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,800
it was like,
you know,

2332
01:38:04,801 --> 01:38:05,634
uh,
uh,

2333
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:08,430
a psychedelic wrestling match or
something like that.

2334
01:38:08,431 --> 01:38:09,264
I mean,
it was,

2335
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:12,420
it was so much more interesting and
bizarre and weird,

2336
01:38:12,421 --> 01:38:15,330
and he saw these great details and,
um,

2337
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,770
and he was just,
I,

2338
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:21,690
I think it was a great approach to
journalism,

2339
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:22,640
but,
you know,

2340
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:25,350
sadly there aren't that many people who
can pull it off because it just

2341
01:38:25,351 --> 01:38:27,000
required,
um,

2342
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:29,460
you know,
surpassing literary talent.

2343
01:38:29,461 --> 01:38:30,360
And that's,
that's,

2344
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:35,460
that's incredibly rare.
What was a unique combination of fiction

2345
01:38:35,461 --> 01:38:40,461
writing along with like
an actual understanding analysis?

2346
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:43,740
Yeah.
That was,

2347
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:46,330
that was his,
his cause is great cause it,

2348
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:47,280
cause you're right,
he,

2349
01:38:47,281 --> 01:38:50,430
he,
he would bring you in and,

2350
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:52,140
uh,
the,

2351
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:54,240
uh,
the reader would,

2352
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:57,150
would kind of surf along this
incredibly,

2353
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,230
uh,
uh,

2354
01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:00,310
charged,
fast paced,

2355
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,630
uh,
a narrative that read like,

2356
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,300
you know,
the,

2357
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:06,910
the fastest,
most engrossing fiction or,

2358
01:39:07,430 --> 01:39:10,590
uh,
but he would intersperse it and stop and

2359
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:13,980
pull back a and do a,
what we call it,

2360
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:15,630
a rolling stone.
We call them wisdoms,

2361
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:16,591
right?
Where,

2362
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:18,450
you know,
he's just sort of stop and say,

2363
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:20,220
here,
here's my take on this.

2364
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:21,960
And those were amazing.
I mean,

2365
01:39:21,961 --> 01:39:23,910
he just,
he just had this ability to sort of cut

2366
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:27,480
through the bullshit and see,
see things from an angle that nobody

2367
01:39:27,481 --> 01:39:30,080
else saw.
And that was the,

2368
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:32,190
uh,
rare technique back then.

2369
01:39:32,191 --> 01:39:32,431
The,
I,

2370
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:36,450
the idea of the kind of individualized,
um,

2371
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:38,040
take on things.

2372
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,470
Uh,
nobody was doing that and reporting back

2373
01:39:40,471 --> 01:39:42,690
then.
I mean it was the,

2374
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:44,300
no,
nobody even thought of it as a form,

2375
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:46,410
as a form that you can really experiment
with.

2376
01:39:46,411 --> 01:39:48,330
I mean,
there were a few people back then like

2377
01:39:48,331 --> 01:39:52,230
terry southern and Tom Wolfe who were,
who were doing some things like that,

2378
01:39:52,231 --> 01:39:54,420
but,
but Thompson was completely unique.

2379
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:58,230
Uh,
and there hasn't been anybody like him,

2380
01:39:58,231 --> 01:39:59,190
you know.
So since,

2381
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:00,960
since then I think,
I think,

2382
01:40:00,961 --> 01:40:02,890
uh,
um,

2383
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:05,010
it's,
it's not an accident that nobody's been

2384
01:40:05,011 --> 01:40:07,620
able to pull that off again now.
Well,

2385
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:10,890
you get compared to him a lot.
And,

2386
01:40:10,891 --> 01:40:14,580
um,
one one way I really saw that comparison

2387
01:40:14,581 --> 01:40:19,400
was your brilliant coverage of the
financial crisis and what was the,

2388
01:40:19,401 --> 01:40:23,070
the mechanisms behind the scene of the
financial crisis and that I became a

2389
01:40:23,071 --> 01:40:24,930
really big fan of your work,
uh,

2390
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,340
reading that because that I think you
covered that as well,

2391
01:40:29,341 --> 01:40:30,420
if not better than anybody.

2392
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,201
Oh,
thanks.

2393
01:40:31,201 --> 01:40:32,034
Yeah.
I mean,

2394
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:35,730
so I,
I knew nothing about any,

2395
01:40:35,731 --> 01:40:38,820
I couldn't even balance my checkbook
when they assigned me to that story.

2396
01:40:38,821 --> 01:40:40,440
And,
um,

2397
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:44,280
and I had to start basically from square
one and,

2398
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:48,240
uh,
I was calling people and saying things

2399
01:40:48,241 --> 01:40:49,590
like,
can you tell me something about

2400
01:40:49,591 --> 01:40:51,300
something that I'll understand?
You know,

2401
01:40:51,301 --> 01:40:54,220
I was kind of cold calling investment
banks and literally saying that.

2402
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:59,700
And I finally got a guy to,
to have lunch with me and he said,

2403
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:05,350
your problem is that you're trying to
understand this as an economic story.

2404
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:08,170
Um,
once you look at it as a crime story,

2405
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:10,240
you'll get it.
Uh,

2406
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:12,940
and,
and from that point forward,

2407
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:14,440
I,
I totally,

2408
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,440
I felt like I,
I started to understand the whole

2409
01:41:17,441 --> 01:41:20,380
mechanism wa the sub prime mortgage
scam.

2410
01:41:20,381 --> 01:41:21,940
It really was a scam.
It's really,

2411
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:27,240
it's really just a massive corporatized
version of like selling a Oregano is,

2412
01:41:30,221 --> 01:41:31,950
we'd basically,
uh,

2413
01:41:31,970 --> 01:41:34,660
they,
they took stuff that these,

2414
01:41:34,661 --> 01:41:39,220
these incredibly worthless,
a highly risky mortgage loans,

2415
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,060
right?

2416
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:41,740
You know,
they would give out loans to everybody

2417
01:41:41,741 --> 01:41:43,930
with a pulse.
Um,

2418
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,520
you know,
whether you had a job or not,

2419
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:47,740
whether you were a citizen or not,
didn't matter.

2420
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:50,650
Port thing was to get the loan
immediately,

2421
01:41:50,651 --> 01:41:51,970
sell it off,
chop it up,

2422
01:41:51,971 --> 01:41:55,780
turn it into securities,
and then they use this highly advanced,

2423
01:41:56,020 --> 01:42:01,020
um,
sort of mathematical trick to turn all

2424
01:42:01,391 --> 01:42:04,780
that sort of mortgage hamburger into
triple a rated securities.

2425
01:42:04,781 --> 01:42:06,790
So you'd have like a,
you know,

2426
01:42:06,791 --> 01:42:11,791
a junk rated mortgage,
like the riskiest a loan in existence.

2427
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:16,600
Uh,
something that was so toxic that country

2428
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:19,720
companies like country ride wouldn't
want to hold onto it for more than a

2429
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:22,960
week because they were afraid it would,
the stuff would blow up and then they

2430
01:42:22,961 --> 01:42:26,200
would sell it off to like a pension fund
or,

2431
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:27,820
um,
you know,

2432
01:42:27,821 --> 01:42:31,960
an insurance company in the form of a
AAA rated security,

2433
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,490
which,
you know,

2434
01:42:33,491 --> 01:42:35,770
is as safe as a US treasury bond.

2435
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,420
So it was,
it was a scam.

2436
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:39,480
Uh,
again,

2437
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:39,841
the,
the,

2438
01:42:39,841 --> 01:42:40,720
the,
the,

2439
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:42,730
the,
the metaphor of,

2440
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:46,180
you know,
baby powder taking baby powder and

2441
01:42:46,181 --> 01:42:48,730
selling it as coke or whatever,
that that's exactly what it was.

2442
01:42:48,731 --> 01:42:51,820
They just took worthless shit and sold
it as something that was,

2443
01:42:51,821 --> 01:42:53,770
that was gold.
Uh,

2444
01:42:53,771 --> 01:42:56,140
and they got,
they did it for years and years and

2445
01:42:56,141 --> 01:42:57,150
years and years,
and they,

2446
01:42:57,490 --> 01:43:02,490
they knew that this gigantic,
huge bubble of risk and disaster was

2447
01:43:04,571 --> 01:43:09,520
just accumulating and that someday it
was going to all explode and cascade

2448
01:43:09,521 --> 01:43:10,290
and,
and,

2449
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:14,230
and ruined the economy.
But everybody was trying to time it,

2450
01:43:14,231 --> 01:43:15,790
right.
And,

2451
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:19,930
and bet on when that would happen and
make their money before that,

2452
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:22,390
that Judgment Day came.
And,

2453
01:43:22,391 --> 01:43:23,890
uh,
it was,

2454
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:26,320
it was fascinating once I,
once I started to learn about it,

2455
01:43:26,321 --> 01:43:29,080
it was just such an amazingly
disgusting,

2456
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:31,930
a fascinating story that,
um,

2457
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:35,890
it was just hard not to,
not to get into it a crime story.

2458
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,170
Yeah.
I think of it as a crime story.

2459
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:38,951
Yeah,
no,

2460
01:43:38,951 --> 01:43:40,300
absolutely.
I even got,

2461
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:45,000
one guy gave me a book,
um,

2462
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:49,360
it was called famous famous con artists
in history,

2463
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:51,250
right?
It was like this little tome,

2464
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:53,740
uh,
and smaller than like the smallest paper

2465
01:43:53,741 --> 01:43:57,560
back.
And it was the biography of this guy,

2466
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:02,000
Victor Lustig was his name.
He was famous because he sold the Eiffel

2467
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,230
Tower twice.
All right.

2468
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:06,320
Uh,
and um,

2469
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:08,510
he,
he had this,

2470
01:44:08,511 --> 01:44:11,450
uh,
this scam that he called,

2471
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:13,720
I think it was called the,
the,

2472
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:17,060
the Hungarian box.
Um,

2473
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,790
I'll have to go back and look,
but basically what he would do is he

2474
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:23,810
would get on a boat,
um,

2475
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:27,120
in New York and he had this,
uh,

2476
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:30,980
sort of beautiful Mahogany box with a
crank on it that had two holes in it.

2477
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:35,690
And he would show all the guests that he
would put a blank piece of paper and one

2478
01:44:35,691 --> 01:44:39,470
and turn a crank and a hundred dollar
bill would come out the other end.

2479
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:43,790
Uh,
and he convinced them all that it was a

2480
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:46,890
machine that made money and,
uh,

2481
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:51,860
everybody would offer him an increasing
amount of money for this invention.

2482
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:55,490
Uh,
and he wouldn't sell it until the last

2483
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:56,330
day,
uh,

2484
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,470
when he would sell it for,
you know,

2485
01:44:57,471 --> 01:45:00,230
40 or $50,000,
and then he would disappear and jump off

2486
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:02,270
the boat and in France and never be seen
again.

2487
01:45:02,271 --> 01:45:03,680
People would,
yeah,

2488
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:05,210
there it is.
What's it called?

2489
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:07,223
Uh,

2490
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:08,830
wow.
Yeah,

2491
01:45:08,831 --> 01:45:10,000
there it is.
Um,

2492
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:12,860
but um,
but that's exactly what the mortgage,

2493
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:18,930
let me see his face.
Look at that fucking creep lugging them.

2494
01:45:20,910 --> 01:45:22,800
Wow.
Let me see that box again.

2495
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:25,510
Wow.

2496
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:28,020
That is crazy.
So the,

2497
01:45:28,021 --> 01:45:30,260
yeah,
so it was obviously fake and,

2498
01:45:30,261 --> 01:45:30,991
and,
and,

2499
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:32,930
but that's what the Morgan scam was.
They,

2500
01:45:32,931 --> 01:45:37,740
they,
they were taking basically blank paper,

2501
01:45:37,741 --> 01:45:40,830
these,
these sub prime loans that belonged to

2502
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:44,940
janitors who were going to foreclose
within 10 minutes.

2503
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:49,410
All right.
And they were telling people that,

2504
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,810
oh,
we have this new mathematical process

2505
01:45:51,811 --> 01:45:54,330
that allows,
that actually makes this stuff really

2506
01:45:54,331 --> 01:45:55,980
safe.
Um,

2507
01:45:55,981 --> 01:45:59,340
and you can put it in your,
uh,

2508
01:45:59,341 --> 01:46:03,030
in your college endowment,
you can put in your pension fund.

2509
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:05,550
And so all these people,
you know,

2510
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:10,570
who his retirement monies were based on,
on security is we're buying all this

2511
01:46:11,011 --> 01:46:14,250
shit that they thought was,
was aaa aerated.

2512
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,900
And that's,
that's how they woke up and you know,

2513
01:46:15,901 --> 01:46:19,710
and in 2008,
2009 and they found their 401ks where

2514
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:21,240
we're,
you know,

2515
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,970
wiped out by 40% or whatever it was.

2516
01:46:23,970 --> 01:46:26,010
My neighbor really did that happen to
him.

2517
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,350
My neighbor bought this plot of land
and,

2518
01:46:28,351 --> 01:46:30,840
uh,
had this dream to build his dream house.

2519
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:31,740
And,
uh,

2520
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:34,500
he would go buy the plot of land and
there was always cleaned it up and

2521
01:46:34,501 --> 01:46:36,510
getting ready and I was talking to him
and then,

2522
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:39,270
boom,
2008 happened.

2523
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:43,290
He lost everything.
And he would still go by that plot of

2524
01:46:43,291 --> 01:46:46,710
land and cleaning it up.
And he and I would talk about it and

2525
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,900
they just told me he lost everything.
Yeah.

2526
01:46:48,901 --> 01:46:50,220
So Never gonna Happen,
Huh?

2527
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,061
Yeah.
No,

2528
01:46:51,061 --> 01:46:52,680
I think he,
uh,

2529
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:56,530
I think he died.
He eventually got really sick and they

2530
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,680
took him out of his house and brought
them somewhere,

2531
01:46:58,681 --> 01:47:00,930
but I think he's dead now.
But yeah,

2532
01:47:00,931 --> 01:47:01,764
his,
uh,

2533
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:06,720
his story was awful,
awful to hear this guy who was in his

2534
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,750
sixties who had got this piece of land
with a nice view and it's like,

2535
01:47:09,751 --> 01:47:12,270
this is where I'm going to drink,
build my dream house.

2536
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,370
And he had all this money prepared for
it,

2537
01:47:14,371 --> 01:47:19,050
all this money saved away and he was
ready to rock and roll and then boom,

2538
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:22,050
it all went out.
It just drained out.

2539
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:24,750
Somebody put a hole in the bottom of the
boat and everything,

2540
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:27,120
everything went to the bottom of the
ocean.

2541
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:28,920
Yeah.
And then he'd probably got ripped off

2542
01:47:28,921 --> 01:47:32,190
twice because it's tax dollars went to
go bail out the guys who,

2543
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:33,360
uh,
you know,

2544
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:36,330
cause some of the,
some of the banks got stuck holding some

2545
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:39,420
of this shit.
And rather than eat the loss is like

2546
01:47:39,421 --> 01:47:40,620
your,
your friend did.

2547
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:44,100
They got the Federal Reserve to buy it
from them,

2548
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,160
you know?
And,

2549
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,780
and,
or,

2550
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:50,790
or the treasury.
So all the fuck did they get away with

2551
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:54,750
giving the Ceos bonuses during that
time?

2552
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:55,710
Yeah,
I mean,

2553
01:47:55,711 --> 01:47:57,640
I ain't bonuses during the time where
the,

2554
01:47:57,641 --> 01:48:00,120
they had to be bailed out by the
taxpayers.

2555
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:01,710
Yeah.
That was another scam.

2556
01:48:01,711 --> 01:48:03,540
Like,
so there were,

2557
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:06,180
if you looked at the fine print of all
the bail outs,

2558
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:09,000
it's basically said that,
um,

2559
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:14,010
you had to repay the money by us by x
time before you could start paying

2560
01:48:14,011 --> 01:48:16,080
people exorbitant amounts of money
again.

2561
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:18,930
Uh,
but a lot of those,

2562
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,450
a lot of those conditions were never
really followed.

2563
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,250
And you know,
the,

2564
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:26,640
the conditions of repayment we're kind
of glossed over.

2565
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:28,790
And,
um,

2566
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:30,180
the,
the,

2567
01:48:30,181 --> 01:48:33,210
the companies that they were supposed to
be able to pass these things called

2568
01:48:33,211 --> 01:48:36,750
stress tests,
which demonstrated that they were back

2569
01:48:36,751 --> 01:48:40,950
on solid footing again before they paid
people a bonuses.

2570
01:48:40,951 --> 01:48:43,950
But the stress tests are all fudged in,
you know,

2571
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:44,980
I mean,
there were,

2572
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:49,980
there was crime and corruption
illegality basically in every direction

2573
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:52,170
during that whole period.
And,

2574
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:53,030
and,
uh,

2575
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:54,830
not just in the government,
but in,

2576
01:48:54,831 --> 01:48:56,280
in all of these companies as well.

2577
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:57,800
Jesus.
Yeah.

2578
01:48:58,260 --> 01:48:59,510
But fascinating to,
to,

2579
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,660
to follow.
Yeah.

2580
01:49:00,661 --> 01:49:02,280
What was it like covering that?
I mean,

2581
01:49:02,281 --> 01:49:04,350
how long,
how long did you spend working on that?

2582
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:09,120
Seven years probably riced yeah.
Well,

2583
01:49:09,121 --> 01:49:13,200
cause one of the things that I found,
nothing it was really interesting was

2584
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:20,450
I did my first story about this and I
got this incredible reaction because it

2585
01:49:22,261 --> 01:49:25,920
turns out that the financial press,
there is nobody in the financial press

2586
01:49:25,921 --> 01:49:29,640
who writes for ordinary people.
Like it's basically what I was doing was

2587
01:49:29,641 --> 01:49:33,690
a translation job.
I was trying to basically take what had

2588
01:49:33,691 --> 01:49:38,691
happened and explain it in a way that a
person who knew nothing about finance

2589
01:49:39,001 --> 01:49:41,370
would be able to understand.
Uh,

2590
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:43,200
and it turns out that nobody's doing
that.

2591
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:47,680
So all these people who had questions
about who,

2592
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:51,430
who wanted to know what had happened to
their money or why,

2593
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:53,600
why did my house get foreclosed on or
what,

2594
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:54,550
you know,
what's,

2595
01:49:54,551 --> 01:49:57,790
what's a subprime mortgage or anything.

2596
01:49:58,150 --> 01:49:59,560
Um,
you know,

2597
01:49:59,561 --> 01:50:01,360
there,
there was nobody else doing that work.

2598
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:04,060
So I had lots of it to do.
And it was,

2599
01:50:04,061 --> 01:50:06,430
it was really interesting and I just
kept doing it.

2600
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:09,220
Wow.
That had to be depressing.

2601
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:10,151
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

2602
01:50:10,151 --> 01:50:11,320
of course.
Of course.

2603
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:12,490
I mean,
most,

2604
01:50:12,491 --> 01:50:14,590
most investigative reporting is
depressing.

2605
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:18,310
Uh,
look particularly that because I mean,

2606
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:22,450
a lot of it was old people that when got
old people,

2607
01:50:22,451 --> 01:50:23,920
minorities.
I mean,

2608
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,020
uh,
I did one story about,

2609
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:28,780
um,
a bank,

2610
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,970
uh,
in Maryland.

2611
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:32,380
Well,
it's a national bank.

2612
01:50:32,381 --> 01:50:34,160
It's a bank that,
you know,

2613
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:38,530
I wouldn't be surprised that a lot of
people listening how have their accounts

2614
01:50:38,531 --> 01:50:40,330
with this bank,
um,

2615
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:41,840
they,
uh,

2616
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:45,160
had to pay a settlement to the
government because they were,

2617
01:50:45,190 --> 01:50:48,700
uh,
intentionally targeting elderly black

2618
01:50:48,701 --> 01:50:50,020
people,
uh,

2619
01:50:50,021 --> 01:50:54,280
to sell sub prime mortgages to,
and they called the mud people.

2620
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,980
Uh,
and there were all these,

2621
01:50:56,050 --> 01:51:00,490
these plague toxic emails going back and
forth about how stupid they were and how

2622
01:51:00,491 --> 01:51:02,010
they'll buy anything,
et Cetera,

2623
01:51:02,011 --> 01:51:02,844
et cetera.

2624
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:04,420
Emails,
they call them mud people.

2625
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:05,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

2626
01:51:05,531 --> 01:51:08,200
And so they had to pay a settlement to
the government and,

2627
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:09,221
but the,
you know,

2628
01:51:09,221 --> 01:51:10,900
the racial component of the,
of,

2629
01:51:10,901 --> 01:51:14,350
of that crash was something that I
didn't really clue into it until late,

2630
01:51:14,351 --> 01:51:16,570
but that was a big part of it too.
It was,

2631
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:22,020
um,
a lot of it involved these mortgage

2632
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:28,141
lenders going into particularly like
lower middle class black neighborhoods

2633
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:33,070
and knocking on doors where there'd be
like an elderly person at home and

2634
01:51:33,071 --> 01:51:34,570
saying,
hey,

2635
01:51:34,571 --> 01:51:38,440
would you like to refi your mortgage and
you'll have a little bit of extra

2636
01:51:38,441 --> 01:51:40,270
spending money this month.
Right.

2637
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:45,170
And the person won't know anything about
finance and they'll,

2638
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:49,780
they'll sign this refinance deal that
allows them to save a little bit of

2639
01:51:49,781 --> 01:51:53,140
money each month.
Not knowing that they had just converted

2640
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:55,840
their fixed mortgage into a floating
mortgage.

2641
01:51:56,170 --> 01:51:58,690
And that is seen as the interest rates
changed.

2642
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:02,020
You know,
you'd have people who went from paying

2643
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:05,740
$900 a month to paying $7,000 a month,
right.

2644
01:52:05,741 --> 01:52:08,590
And suddenly they're out in the street
and,

2645
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:10,340
and you know,
the,

2646
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,300
uh,
the company that sold them the loan is

2647
01:52:13,301 --> 01:52:14,490
long gone by then.
They,

2648
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:15,880
they,
they're not holding it.

2649
01:52:15,881 --> 01:52:18,220
They,
as soon as they got her name on the,

2650
01:52:18,221 --> 01:52:21,160
on the dotted line,
they sold it off to a bank in New York

2651
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,980
who in turn again chopped it up into
hamburger and sold it probably to you

2652
01:52:24,981 --> 01:52:29,440
are a pension fund or who or whatever.
So there's nobody she could complain to

2653
01:52:29,441 --> 01:52:30,280
and you know.
Yeah.

2654
01:52:30,281 --> 01:52:33,820
That stuff was really depressing.
What was the feeling like of having very

2655
01:52:33,821 --> 01:52:38,550
little understanding about finance and
then immersing yourself in it and that

2656
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:41,650
was fascinating.
This is the underlying structure that

2657
01:52:41,651 --> 01:52:46,580
our society is run on that our money is
established through like this is,

2658
01:52:46,581 --> 01:52:51,350
this is how we,
we sell houses and loans and this is

2659
01:52:51,351 --> 01:52:52,300
what we're doing this.

2660
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:53,301
Yeah,
no,

2661
01:52:53,301 --> 01:52:54,500
it was,
it was fascinating.

2662
01:52:54,501 --> 01:52:57,500
I,
because before that I was mostly

2663
01:52:57,501 --> 01:53:00,560
covering like elections,
right?

2664
01:53:00,561 --> 01:53:02,030
And again,
if you cover elections,

2665
01:53:02,031 --> 01:53:06,530
it's incredibly boring and you never
hear anything of substance and it's not

2666
01:53:06,531 --> 01:53:08,190
terribly complicated.
And you know,

2667
01:53:08,210 --> 01:53:10,880
one,
one the Democrats says that,

2668
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:13,400
you know,
we want to help the middle class and the

2669
01:53:13,401 --> 01:53:15,950
Republicans says we want to protect
family values.

2670
01:53:15,951 --> 01:53:19,580
And that's pretty much the extent of the
intellectual challenge in terms of

2671
01:53:19,581 --> 01:53:23,030
covering that stuff.
And I always thought to myself,

2672
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:25,160
you know,
politics in America must be a lot more

2673
01:53:25,161 --> 01:53:26,480
complicated than this,
right.

2674
01:53:26,481 --> 01:53:31,481
There must be some other hidden thing
where it's incredibly complex and

2675
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:35,180
diabolical and,
and you know,

2676
01:53:35,181 --> 01:53:35,730
the,
the,

2677
01:53:35,730 --> 01:53:38,900
the real machinations of power must be
visible somewhere.

2678
01:53:39,290 --> 01:53:40,880
And,
um,

2679
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:44,990
I think that you find that when you,
when you start looking at the,

2680
01:53:44,991 --> 01:53:47,540
how Wall Street works,
how money works,

2681
01:53:47,541 --> 01:53:49,490
how central banking works,
how,

2682
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:51,920
um,
you know,

2683
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:55,730
how the concentration of wealth works.

2684
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:56,653
Uh,
I mean,

2685
01:53:56,690 --> 01:54:01,690
basically the subprime scheme was an
effort to pull the remaining savings out

2686
01:54:04,191 --> 01:54:05,450
of the population.
Right?

2687
01:54:05,451 --> 01:54:06,760
There just wasn't,
you know,

2688
01:54:06,770 --> 01:54:09,710
in the old days,
invest in banks made their money by

2689
01:54:09,711 --> 01:54:13,430
lending money to companies who would
build factories and they would make

2690
01:54:13,431 --> 01:54:16,290
stuff and sell it around the world and
everybody would make money and never,

2691
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:18,110
you know,
even even the,

2692
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:19,880
the population would,
would,

2693
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:23,960
would benefit from it.
But that manufacturing economy,

2694
01:54:23,961 --> 01:54:26,080
it's all gone.
It's overseas.

2695
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:31,330
So you have this financial as the
economy and they have no normal

2696
01:54:31,581 --> 01:54:35,180
beneficial.
A way to make money and all their,

2697
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:39,200
all of it can really do is look to see
where is their money and how can we get

2698
01:54:39,201 --> 01:54:41,660
it.
And most people had money in their

2699
01:54:41,661 --> 01:54:42,920
houses,
right?

2700
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:46,820
Like the,
the accumulated savings of most people.

2701
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:50,570
Whatever was left after the Internet
crash in the nineties,

2702
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:52,370
uh,
was in real estate.

2703
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:57,670
And this was the scam by which they took
the wealth that was left in the pockets

2704
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:06,161
of ordinary people and transferred it to
nine people in Manhattan basically.

2705
01:55:07,131 --> 01:55:07,511
I mean,
that's,

2706
01:55:07,511 --> 01:55:09,440
that's why you have,
you know,

2707
01:55:09,441 --> 01:55:12,530
we told them when we talk about wealth
inequality now,

2708
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,530
right,
it being a huge factor that,

2709
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:20,090
you know,
the top 95,

2710
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:24,320
I'm sorry,
the top 1% of the population owns 90% of

2711
01:55:24,321 --> 01:55:25,970
the wealth in the country or whatever it
is.

2712
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:30,740
That's a consequence of schemes like
this where they're just there,

2713
01:55:30,741 --> 01:55:34,790
they're finding out where people have a
little bit of money and they're

2714
01:55:34,791 --> 01:55:39,020
systematically coming up with scams to
move it from there to here.

2715
01:55:39,470 --> 01:55:41,780
No consequences,
no with no consequences.

2716
01:55:41,781 --> 01:55:44,910
And that was the other part of the,
that that I ended up having to cover

2717
01:55:44,911 --> 01:55:46,020
later,
which was,

2718
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:48,960
you know,
the last time they tried something like

2719
01:55:48,961 --> 01:55:50,910
this,
like during the s and l crisis,

2720
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:56,620
which was also sort of a giant fraud
scheme also that involved real estate

2721
01:55:57,481 --> 01:56:01,350
lending and you know,
but the government after that actually,

2722
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,080
you know,
and died at 1800 people,

2723
01:56:04,081 --> 01:56:05,700
they put 800 people in jail.

2724
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:07,130
They put a lot of,
you know,

2725
01:56:07,590 --> 01:56:09,960
serious,
influential people on the dock after

2726
01:56:09,961 --> 01:56:11,910
that.
Uh,

2727
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:15,210
nobody,
nobody went to jail after this stuff.

2728
01:56:15,211 --> 01:56:17,640
And there was,
and people think that,

2729
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:19,320
well,
they didn't do anything that was

2730
01:56:19,321 --> 01:56:20,950
technically illegal.
No bullshit there.

2731
01:56:20,951 --> 01:56:25,951
There was lots of stuff that was,
that was brazenly criminally illegal.

2732
01:56:26,131 --> 01:56:26,760
I mean,
they,

2733
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:29,670
they committed fraud on a broad scale.
Uh,

2734
01:56:29,671 --> 01:56:32,790
but some of these companies were into
things that were even worse than that.

2735
01:56:32,791 --> 01:56:35,340
I mean,
you take HSBC,

2736
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:40,940
HSBC admitted to laundering $850 million
for a pair of central and South American

2737
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:44,640
drug cartels,
uh,

2738
01:56:44,641 --> 01:56:46,530
including the Sinaloa cartel,
right.

2739
01:56:46,531 --> 01:56:48,600
Which is suspected and thousands of
murders,

2740
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:50,860
like,
and you know,

2741
01:56:50,910 --> 01:56:53,760
they,
they admitted to this activity,

2742
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:59,210
they agreed to a deferred prosecution
agreement with the government where

2743
01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:03,870
nobody did a day in jail.
No individual had to pull out a dime out

2744
01:57:03,871 --> 01:57:05,430
of their own pockets to pay.

2745
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:08,640
The shareholders ponied up one point $9
million,

2746
01:57:08,641 --> 01:57:11,220
but some of that was tax deductible,
which means we pay,

2747
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,950
we paid some of that fine.
Um,

2748
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,730
and uh,
and the only real punishment with any

2749
01:57:17,731 --> 01:57:22,290
teeth is that some of the executives had
to partially defer their bonuses for

2750
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:24,430
five years.
Uh,

2751
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:29,400
so that's it.
Laundering $850 million for narco

2752
01:57:29,401 --> 01:57:33,540
terrorists gets you a total walk.
Uh,

2753
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,820
you know,
that tells you basically everything you

2754
01:57:35,821 --> 01:57:40,821
need to know about w do we prosecute
white collar crime in this country?

2755
01:57:41,311 --> 01:57:42,120
Basically?
No.

2756
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:42,721
You know,
I mean,

2757
01:57:42,721 --> 01:57:45,480
that's the answer ultimately that you
find out.

2758
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:49,230
And there was paperwork that showed they
knew it was from the cartels.

2759
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:50,093
Oh yeah.
They,

2760
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,580
if you've,
if you look at the,

2761
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:54,120
the,
the agreement,

2762
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:55,970
uh,
and you can watch that.

2763
01:57:55,971 --> 01:57:56,520
There's,
there's a,

2764
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,740
there's a video of,
um,

2765
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:04,580
of Loretta Lynch and Lanny Breuer,
cause this was before Laura,

2766
01:58:04,621 --> 01:58:06,720
Loretta Lynch was the attorney general,
but she was,

2767
01:58:06,721 --> 01:58:08,250
um,
uh,

2768
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:10,830
she was basically the head of this deal.

2769
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:14,160
Um,
they talked about the fact that the HSBC

2770
01:58:14,161 --> 01:58:16,860
branches,
because most of this was done in Mexico.

2771
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,660
Um,
uh,

2772
01:58:18,661 --> 01:58:21,330
h Max,
which was the subsidiary company.

2773
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:25,110
They had special teller windows built,
uh,

2774
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:29,850
to fit cashboxes that the drug cartels
were bringing in to the bank.

2775
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:32,470
Uh,
so basically you've seen the,

2776
01:58:32,471 --> 01:58:36,030
seen the seen in scarface for the guys
come in with duffle bags with cash to

2777
01:58:36,031 --> 01:58:37,170
the bank.
Right.

2778
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:38,910
And you know,
that's like a montage,

2779
01:58:38,911 --> 01:58:39,701
you know,
there's that,

2780
01:58:39,701 --> 01:58:41,040
that song,
I forget what song it is,

2781
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:42,550
the background,
same thing.

2782
01:58:42,551 --> 01:58:47,551
These guys would come into the bank,
they would slide in these boxes of cash,

2783
01:58:48,011 --> 01:58:51,430
one after the other,
and that's admitted activity.

2784
01:58:51,431 --> 01:58:52,950
The bank signed off on this.
They,

2785
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:54,430
you know,
it's not like they're contesting it.

2786
01:58:54,431 --> 01:58:56,530
They're not saying,
we neither admit nor deny.

2787
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:58,750
It's,
it's part of the deal.

2788
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:00,580
Uh,
so,

2789
01:59:00,581 --> 01:59:02,440
and,
and they agreed to the amount,

2790
01:59:02,441 --> 01:59:03,274
everything.

2791
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,050
So,
um,

2792
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:07,540
yeah,
it was a one point $9 billion

2793
01:59:07,541 --> 01:59:08,690
settlement.
But you know,

2794
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:09,220
it,
it,

2795
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:11,650
it's not like it came out of the pockets
of the people who did it.

2796
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:14,650
And it's not like any of the people who
did it are in jail.

2797
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:16,300
It's just,
you know,

2798
01:59:16,301 --> 01:59:19,750
a thing that happened and you know,
that's five weeks of profit for the

2799
01:59:19,751 --> 01:59:20,920
bank.
So what,

2800
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:22,600
what the fuck?
They don't care.

2801
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:27,130
Right.
Did you see the documentary inside job?

2802
01:59:27,690 --> 01:59:28,300
Ah,
Yup.

2803
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,770
Yup.
We've covered a lot of the same

2804
01:59:29,771 --> 01:59:30,900
territory.
That's exactly,

2805
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,970
yeah.
That was a sobering documentary where

2806
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,660
they're talking to the very people that
caused the financial crisis and,

2807
01:59:37,690 --> 01:59:41,530
and realizing that these people were
economics professors that eventually got

2808
01:59:41,531 --> 01:59:46,030
these jobs,
really lucrative jobs with banks and how

2809
01:59:46,031 --> 01:59:49,960
they finagle this system and made it so
it looked like these things were

2810
01:59:49,961 --> 01:59:50,920
appropriate.
Yeah,

2811
01:59:50,921 --> 01:59:54,280
no,
I talked to some of the,

2812
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:56,980
some of the things that they invented
that made this,

2813
01:59:56,981 --> 02:00:00,520
the crash possible sounded like good
ideas.

2814
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:03,040
Like they,
they came up with this thing called the

2815
02:00:03,041 --> 02:00:04,810
credit default swap.
Right.

2816
02:00:04,811 --> 02:00:07,450
And I won't bore you with what that is
exactly,

2817
02:00:07,451 --> 02:00:11,170
but basically it's a kind of insurance,
uh,

2818
02:00:11,171 --> 02:00:12,820
where,
uh,

2819
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:15,040
it's,
it's basically a bet.

2820
02:00:15,070 --> 02:00:17,080
It's hard to explain.
Um,

2821
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:22,110
but it's a way of,
of quasi I ensuring a product,

2822
02:00:23,110 --> 02:00:25,270
um,
without having to pony up a lot of

2823
02:00:25,271 --> 02:00:26,800
money.
Uh,

2824
02:00:26,801 --> 02:00:31,120
and the,
it's called the derivative,

2825
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:32,350
right?
Uh,

2826
02:00:32,351 --> 02:00:36,100
and these instruments are completely
unregulated.

2827
02:00:36,370 --> 02:00:39,970
Um,
kind of put the socratic default swap

2828
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:40,990
is,
is like,

2829
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:46,350
uh,
you and I betting on whether or not a

2830
02:00:47,170 --> 02:00:52,060
third person's house is going to a burn
in a fire,

2831
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:55,360
right?
Like the old school insurance said that

2832
02:00:55,361 --> 02:00:58,000
it had to be your house in order for you
to get insurance on it.

2833
02:00:58,270 --> 02:01:02,530
Um,
this new form of [inaudible] insurance

2834
02:01:02,531 --> 02:01:05,200
said that too,
totally disinterested parties could have

2835
02:01:05,201 --> 02:01:06,250
an interest in a,
in a,

2836
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:08,050
in a third thing that happens.

2837
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:10,360
So it's basically gambling.
Uh,

2838
02:01:10,361 --> 02:01:13,900
and um,
on the one hand,

2839
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:18,160
it allowed people to create a whole lot
of capital,

2840
02:01:18,161 --> 02:01:21,850
which allowed them to lend more money,
which theoretically allowed people to

2841
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:24,400
buy more houses.
But in reality,

2842
02:01:24,401 --> 02:01:27,640
it just created the system where all
these people had bets that were back and

2843
02:01:27,641 --> 02:01:29,440
forth on,
on all these properties.

2844
02:01:29,441 --> 02:01:33,100
So that's one of the reasons why the,
when the crash happened,

2845
02:01:33,101 --> 02:01:34,930
when,
when all those mortgages started to

2846
02:01:34,931 --> 02:01:37,900
fail,
it wasn't just the failures of those

2847
02:01:37,901 --> 02:01:39,830
properties.
It was all these people who are betting

2848
02:01:39,831 --> 02:01:43,220
on whether or not these people could,
could pay their mortgages.

2849
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:46,580
They started to lose money and then
there were people who had bets on that.

2850
02:01:46,581 --> 02:01:50,690
He started to lose money and it's like
this cascading whirlpool of shit that

2851
02:01:50,691 --> 02:01:53,060
happened.
And um,

2852
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:53,811
again,
it just,

2853
02:01:53,811 --> 02:01:57,920
it started out as an idea to just create
more money to lend to lend.

2854
02:01:58,130 --> 02:02:03,130
And it turned into this nightmare,
a mechanical scenario that just,

2855
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:06,080
that created losses.
Uh,

2856
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:09,150
you know,
in this almost apocalyptic fashion.

2857
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:11,900
And a lot of them had no idea,
but that,

2858
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,670
that was going to be the eventuality.

2859
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:17,090
Wow.
Yeah,

2860
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:17,960
it was,
it's,

2861
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:19,850
it's crazy.
It's definitely crazy stuff.

2862
02:02:20,210 --> 02:02:23,480
As a person who didn't really follow
finance before,

2863
02:02:23,481 --> 02:02:25,670
how much has that affected your life
down?

2864
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:30,140
Like the way you look at things?
I definitely pay a lot more attention to

2865
02:02:30,650 --> 02:02:32,310
the fine print.
Uh,

2866
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:35,180
when I enter into any financial
contract,

2867
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:39,950
um,
I think about where I do my banking.

2868
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:42,590
Uh,
but the reality is you just don't have a

2869
02:02:42,591 --> 02:02:44,630
whole lot of choice in this country
anyway.

2870
02:02:44,631 --> 02:02:46,220
I mean,
it's like everything else.

2871
02:02:46,221 --> 02:02:49,100
There's only a few companies left.
Um,

2872
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:52,660
so almost every bank,
uh,

2873
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:56,100
that's out there where you can have a
bank account and a mortgage is,

2874
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:59,600
is a bank that I've written about
something massive scandal,

2875
02:02:59,650 --> 02:03:00,530
uh,
before.

2876
02:03:00,531 --> 02:03:01,580
So,
uh,

2877
02:03:01,581 --> 02:03:02,270
that,
that's,

2878
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:04,280
that's a problem.
Um,

2879
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:05,270
but,
uh,

2880
02:03:05,271 --> 02:03:07,310
yeah,
I worry about it all the time and I have

2881
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:11,510
friends in finance who call me and they,
they tell me that,

2882
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:14,780
you know,
that the things that are incredibly

2883
02:03:14,781 --> 02:03:16,280
unsafe and that this,
that,

2884
02:03:16,281 --> 02:03:17,270
and the other could,
could,

2885
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:18,230
could happen.

2886
02:03:18,230 --> 02:03:21,440
And so I have an anxiety level about
things that I never had before.

2887
02:03:21,441 --> 02:03:23,750
But um,
apart from that,

2888
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:24,650
yeah,
I mean,

2889
02:03:24,710 --> 02:03:29,710
that's a natural consequence of,
of having to spend seven years looking

2890
02:03:31,071 --> 02:03:33,140
at all these horror stories.
It's crazy.

2891
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:35,060
It's crazy.
You spent that much time on it.

2892
02:03:36,170 --> 02:03:39,130
Do you see any other bubbles coming up?
Yeah,

2893
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:42,470
people talk about that all the time.
Um,

2894
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:45,500
there's a lot of,
um,

2895
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:50,360
a lot of negative press about subprime
auto loans for instance,

2896
02:03:50,361 --> 02:03:52,400
which is,
uh,

2897
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:55,610
it's not exactly the same but it's a
similar thing.

2898
02:03:55,611 --> 02:04:00,611
I mean the same basic scam of taking
loans,

2899
02:04:01,580 --> 02:04:06,110
chopping them up and then repackaging
them as something that's more valuable

2900
02:04:06,111 --> 02:04:08,870
than the original loan.
You can do that with anything,

2901
02:04:08,871 --> 02:04:11,150
any kind of credit.
You can do that with credit cards.

2902
02:04:11,151 --> 02:04:13,360
You can do it with aircraft loans,
you can do it with,

2903
02:04:13,390 --> 02:04:15,150
with car loans,
you can do it with,

2904
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:16,370
with home mortgages.

2905
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:18,900
Um,
and so the,

2906
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:23,920
the mechanism of taking things that are,
are toxic and risky and making them look

2907
02:04:25,521 --> 02:04:28,460
like aaa is still,
uh,

2908
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:33,170
it's still part of the economy and um,
it's everywhere.

2909
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:37,280
The plus side of that is that there is
more credit available.

2910
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:38,161
Uh,
you know,

2911
02:04:38,161 --> 02:04:41,970
almost anybody can get a credit card or
even if you've had screwed up credit,

2912
02:04:41,971 --> 02:04:43,530
you can get a car,
you know,

2913
02:04:43,531 --> 02:04:45,420
I mean,
there's this is this put us in this

2914
02:04:45,630 --> 02:04:48,300
endless cycle of buildup,
bubble collapse,

2915
02:04:48,301 --> 02:04:49,510
build up,
bubble collapse,

2916
02:04:50,190 --> 02:04:52,380
rebounding,
collapse again.

2917
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,310
Absolutely.
I mean,

2918
02:04:53,311 --> 02:04:54,720
I think that's,
that's,

2919
02:04:55,110 --> 02:04:58,870
that's why you have to be nervous about
the,

2920
02:04:58,990 --> 02:05:03,190
you know,
the skyrocketing stock exchange because

2921
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:04,620
we've had a fine,
yeah.

2922
02:05:04,621 --> 02:05:05,371
I mean,
you should be.

2923
02:05:05,371 --> 02:05:05,951
Right.
Do you have,

2924
02:05:05,951 --> 02:05:08,190
what are you heavily invested in?
I've got some in there.

2925
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:10,140
I just did when,
when the whole,

2926
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:12,240
you know,
when trump was saying the economy's

2927
02:05:12,241 --> 02:05:14,480
never been better,
look at the stock market stock markets,

2928
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:17,850
killing it all these days,
and then it'll have a bad day and you're

2929
02:05:17,851 --> 02:05:18,181
like,
well,

2930
02:05:18,181 --> 02:05:19,560
okay,
well I thought we were doing great.

2931
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:22,560
Like what's going on with his bad day?
Can you not control these bad days?

2932
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:24,030
Right?
Like what's happening here?

2933
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:24,960
Right.
If you're,

2934
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,570
if you're in control of the good days,
you're also in control of the bad days.

2935
02:05:27,571 --> 02:05:28,201
Right?
Yeah,

2936
02:05:28,201 --> 02:05:29,490
of course.
Of course.

2937
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:30,930
It just,
it seems,

2938
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:33,840
it seems super suspicious.
Yeah.

2939
02:05:33,841 --> 02:05:35,850
And,
and in the old days,

2940
02:05:35,851 --> 02:05:38,700
you'd have a lot of confidence that,
well,

2941
02:05:38,701 --> 02:05:41,040
the stock market always eventually goes
up.

2942
02:05:41,190 --> 02:05:43,440
So yeah,
there's going to be bad days,

2943
02:05:43,441 --> 02:05:44,720
but it'll,
it'll go back up.

2944
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:48,360
But the problem is the underlying
economy in America just isn't all that

2945
02:05:48,361 --> 02:05:49,320
hot.
You know,

2946
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:52,200
like we're like,
what do we really make in this country?

2947
02:05:52,201 --> 02:05:54,810
What,
wha where's the floor?

2948
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:56,160
Right?
Like we have,

2949
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:58,920
we have some industries that sorta
perform well,

2950
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:00,780
but if,
you know,

2951
02:06:00,781 --> 02:06:03,930
periodically we go through these bubbles
that are based on nothing more than

2952
02:06:03,931 --> 02:06:05,730
enthusiasm.
Uh,

2953
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:07,660
you know,
in the nineties it was the,

2954
02:06:07,870 --> 02:06:09,700
the tech bubble,
right?

2955
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:12,420
Where people like Alan Greenspan would
say things like,

2956
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:14,400
well,
we have a new paradigm and economics,

2957
02:06:14,401 --> 02:06:15,234
right?
So,

2958
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:18,510
um,
it doesn't matter whether a company

2959
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:22,710
hasn't shown any ability to make money
or,

2960
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:24,030
um,
you know,

2961
02:06:24,330 --> 02:06:28,470
has no reasonable profit and loss
statements.

2962
02:06:28,471 --> 02:06:30,210
It's just,
if it's a good idea,

2963
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:35,600
the stock is sound and everybody should
invest in it and the stock market is

2964
02:06:35,731 --> 02:06:37,200
going to continually go up,
go up.

2965
02:06:37,201 --> 02:06:40,320
So don't worry about it.
Of course that doesn't happen and

2966
02:06:40,410 --> 02:06:41,820
everybody blows.
It blows up.

2967
02:06:41,821 --> 02:06:44,100
Everybody loses their shirt.
But what,

2968
02:06:44,101 --> 02:06:45,420
what do they do?
The Fed,

2969
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:50,520
lowered interest rates basically allows
Wall Street to recapitalize,

2970
02:06:50,521 --> 02:06:53,520
drink itself sober,
and they plunge into the next,

2971
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:56,490
the next madness,
which is mortgages.

2972
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:59,910
And once again,
you have Alan Greenspan saying,

2973
02:06:59,911 --> 02:07:00,780
hey,
you know,

2974
02:07:01,290 --> 02:07:03,570
real estate is a great bet.
It's,

2975
02:07:03,571 --> 02:07:05,520
you know,
it's going to continually ascend.

2976
02:07:05,970 --> 02:07:08,970
People should use their homes as ATM
machines.

2977
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:09,840
You know,
you should,

2978
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:13,290
you should consider refinancing your
house so that you can get a little bit

2979
02:07:13,291 --> 02:07:14,610
of extra cash.
And,

2980
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,110
and this,
this,

2981
02:07:16,111 --> 02:07:19,050
this was actually the message they sent
to America and it again,

2982
02:07:19,051 --> 02:07:24,051
it creates this artificial mania where
the economy's stoked artificially,

2983
02:07:25,950 --> 02:07:28,830
uh,
two gigantic dimensions,

2984
02:07:28,831 --> 02:07:31,680
but it's not based on anything.
And so when,

2985
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:33,810
when it,
and it crashes,

2986
02:07:33,811 --> 02:07:36,730
when you finally get like any scheme,
you know,

2987
02:07:36,731 --> 02:07:40,750
it depends.
It depends on more new investors coming

2988
02:07:40,751 --> 02:07:42,670
in and old investors leaving,
right?

2989
02:07:42,671 --> 02:07:46,570
So there's always going to be that
moment when suddenly we don't have as

2990
02:07:46,571 --> 02:07:50,200
many new ones and old ones.
And the instant that happens,

2991
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:52,270
it all goes,
Kaboom.

2992
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:54,100
Right?
And that's what happened with,

2993
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,470
with,
uh,

2994
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:59,440
the subprime market.
There was a moment in time where the,

2995
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:01,110
they just couldn't keep it going
anymore.

2996
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:04,000
They couldn't find any more new soccer's
the to get to,

2997
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:09,240
to sell mortgages to and the mania ended
and an all went splat and then it was

2998
02:08:09,581 --> 02:08:14,581
amplified by the fact that we have this
system now of people betting on credit,

2999
02:08:15,460 --> 02:08:17,530
uh,
that is legal,

3000
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:21,610
um,
which creates more losses out of at a

3001
02:08:21,611 --> 02:08:22,240
thin air.

3002
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:25,170
So yeah,
I'm terrified every time I see this,

3003
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:26,950
the,
the stock market go up.

3004
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:30,040
What's it based on?
Is it based on our economy actually

3005
02:08:30,041 --> 02:08:31,390
doing well?
I don't know.

3006
02:08:31,391 --> 02:08:33,160
I don't think so.
You know,

3007
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:34,930
um,
I'm sorry.

3008
02:08:34,931 --> 02:08:36,460
I look like I'm scaring you a little
bit.

3009
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:38,680
Definitely a scary thing,
but I think that's good.

3010
02:08:38,681 --> 02:08:40,260
I think I need to be scared.
I,

3011
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:43,120
I tend to take these things and just,
you know,

3012
02:08:43,121 --> 02:08:45,820
I have financial advisors.
I like let them handle money.

3013
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:47,800
When I hear things like this,
I just go,

3014
02:08:47,801 --> 02:08:48,634
oh,
Jesus.

3015
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:51,280
Well,
I get terrified when I hear about really

3016
02:08:51,281 --> 02:08:55,120
smart people getting scammed.
Like yesterday we were talking about,

3017
02:08:55,170 --> 02:08:56,190
uh,
theranose.

3018
02:08:56,191 --> 02:09:00,220
Do you know that a blood testing company
that turned out to be total horse shit?

3019
02:09:00,250 --> 02:09:01,420
No,
I didn't hear about this.

3020
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:02,590
Oh,
it's a great story.

3021
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:05,560
It's a,
it's a story of one of those things

3022
02:09:05,561 --> 02:09:09,400
where you,
you find someone who you hope exists and

3023
02:09:09,401 --> 02:09:10,234
you build them up.

3024
02:09:10,510 --> 02:09:13,810
There was this woman,
she looked like Steve Jobs.

3025
02:09:13,811 --> 02:09:17,290
She wore a black turtle neck and every
photo and uh,

3026
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:18,640
she was,
uh,

3027
02:09:18,670 --> 02:09:22,150
the,
the richest ever self made woman.

3028
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:26,230
She was worth $4 billion.
She had built this company called the

3029
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:29,950
rhinos right out of college.
She was like 19 when she started the

3030
02:09:29,951 --> 02:09:32,830
company.
It was a blood testing company that just

3031
02:09:32,831 --> 02:09:36,880
required a small prick of your blood to
do complicated blood analysis for

3032
02:09:36,881 --> 02:09:40,120
diseases and things along those lines.
It turns out it didn't work at all.

3033
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:43,030
And uh,
Dave faked a bunch of shit.

3034
02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:46,620
God spread fraud.
A lot of people got their blood tested.

3035
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:47,770
It turned out to be,
you know,

3036
02:09:47,771 --> 02:09:49,690
they,
they were at risk for all these diseases

3037
02:09:49,691 --> 02:09:53,740
and uh,
Warren Buffet have invested $100

3038
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:55,390
million.
I think at one 25,

3039
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:56,860
uh,
Betsy Devos,

3040
02:09:56,890 --> 02:09:58,360
uh,
more than a hundred million dollars,

3041
02:09:58,361 --> 02:10:01,090
like all these super wealthy people get
scammed.

3042
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:02,200
Wow.
Yeah.

3043
02:10:02,201 --> 02:10:04,630
When you find out that really wealthy
people,

3044
02:10:04,650 --> 02:10:06,880
right,
that do this for a living,

3045
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:12,090
Warren Buffet does that for a living
that he can get scammed out of $125

3046
02:10:15,070 --> 02:10:15,380
million.

3047
02:10:15,380 --> 02:10:16,230
Right?
Yeah.

3048
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:16,701
And,
and,

3049
02:10:16,701 --> 02:10:18,010
and Warren Buffett,
his,

3050
02:10:18,940 --> 02:10:23,710
his mantra is supposed to be picking
the,

3051
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:27,310
the absolute longterm investment,
right?

3052
02:10:27,311 --> 02:10:31,180
So it's not,
he's not like a Stevie Cohen type who

3053
02:10:31,181 --> 02:10:34,330
just looks at the tape and tries to time
it just right.

3054
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:38,810
So you can make an investment for 10
seconds and come out with,

3055
02:10:38,811 --> 02:10:39,370
with,
uh,

3056
02:10:39,370 --> 02:10:40,970
you know,
if he,

3057
02:10:40,971 --> 02:10:42,440
if he's investing in a company and,
uh,

3058
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:45,230
and even he can be fooled.
That's,

3059
02:10:45,231 --> 02:10:46,820
that's pretty terrible.
But look at Enron.

3060
02:10:46,821 --> 02:10:47,631
I mean,
and run was,

3061
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:51,740
was another example of the world's best
financial analysts were looking at this

3062
02:10:51,741 --> 02:10:56,741
company for a decade,
and the,

3063
02:10:57,050 --> 02:10:59,510
the results were completely ridiculous.
Like,

3064
02:10:59,511 --> 02:11:01,700
it should have been obvious to any lay
person that,

3065
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:03,553
that,
uh,

3066
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:06,110
these profit numbers couldn't possibly
be real.

3067
02:11:06,410 --> 02:11:09,470
Uh,
and it wasn't until,

3068
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:11,570
uh,
one of those guys,

3069
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:12,850
I think it was jim chain,
this,

3070
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:15,830
it was sort of a famous short seller,
um,

3071
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:17,211
sort of said,
hey,

3072
02:11:17,211 --> 02:11:19,370
wait a minute,
that there's something up here.

3073
02:11:19,610 --> 02:11:23,360
Um,
but people continually invested in these

3074
02:11:23,361 --> 02:11:26,330
companies and there's just not a whole
lot of oversight that goes on,

3075
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:27,990
um,
uh,

3076
02:11:28,010 --> 02:11:29,480
with,
with Wall Street.

3077
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:32,120
And I think that's,
that's a major lesson of,

3078
02:11:32,121 --> 02:11:33,140
of,
uh,

3079
02:11:33,290 --> 02:11:36,290
you know,
the last 20 years is that,

3080
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:38,920
is that there's just not a lot of eyes
on,

3081
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:42,770
on crime in this area.
Another example is,

3082
02:11:42,771 --> 02:11:43,880
uh,
uh,

3083
02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:46,640
I'm sorry,
the WHO's the guy scammed all the rich

3084
02:11:46,641 --> 02:11:48,160
people I made off.
Yeah.

3085
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:50,450
I was going to bring him up.
He's the most egregious example,

3086
02:11:50,451 --> 02:11:50,930
right?
Yeah.

3087
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:51,560
Yeah.
I mean,

3088
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:54,110
there are other,
there are other people who did similar

3089
02:11:54,111 --> 02:11:55,870
things.
Um,

3090
02:11:56,030 --> 02:11:57,920
but this guy didn't even make
investments.

3091
02:11:58,060 --> 02:11:58,910
Right.
You know what I mean?

3092
02:11:58,970 --> 02:12:01,460
Like he,
he was literally just sort of taking

3093
02:12:01,461 --> 02:12:03,680
money and you know,
when someone cashed out,

3094
02:12:03,681 --> 02:12:04,514
he would,
you know,

3095
02:12:04,810 --> 02:12:05,780
it was,
it was like,

3096
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:08,680
uh,
who's that little girl t little t,

3097
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:09,400
little t.

3098
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:10,080
Yeah,
exactly.

3099
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:13,490
Just like throwing,
he had a big pile of cash and you know,

3100
02:12:13,491 --> 02:12:15,410
he would,
he would take some men and throw some

3101
02:12:15,411 --> 02:12:18,860
out.
But if the SEC had had at any time,

3102
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:23,120
just looked at his books and said,
what are you invested in?

3103
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:25,560
Um,
it all would have,

3104
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:27,410
you know,
that whole house of cards would have

3105
02:12:27,411 --> 02:12:29,580
fallen and invest in anything.
No,

3106
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,850
he wasn't,
he wasn't making trades,

3107
02:12:32,090 --> 02:12:33,980
he wasn't doing anything,
you know.

3108
02:12:34,070 --> 02:12:36,920
And,
and there were a bunch of stories like

3109
02:12:36,921 --> 02:12:37,850
this.
Uh,

3110
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:42,580
there's a great book called the octopus,
which is about as somebody who did a

3111
02:12:42,581 --> 02:12:45,500
made off like scam and other hedge fund,
um,

3112
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:46,550
where,
same thing,

3113
02:12:46,551 --> 02:12:49,580
they weren't really making trades.
They were just sort of creating phony

3114
02:12:49,581 --> 02:12:52,130
profit and loss statements and,
and,

3115
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:55,850
and creating records that look like
trades.

3116
02:12:56,090 --> 02:12:56,691
Uh,
they could,

3117
02:12:56,691 --> 02:12:59,390
they could tell their investors about,
but they weren't actually doing

3118
02:12:59,391 --> 02:12:59,780
anything.

3119
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:04,730
So if anybody,
any expert at any time had just poke

3120
02:13:04,731 --> 02:13:09,560
their nose into this person's books,
they would have seen it in 10 seconds.

3121
02:13:09,561 --> 02:13:10,221
That's the,
I mean,

3122
02:13:10,221 --> 02:13:12,830
that's the amazing thing about this.
Um,

3123
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:13,610
you know,
not,

3124
02:13:13,610 --> 02:13:15,320
not to get back to,
you know,

3125
02:13:15,321 --> 02:13:16,700
my,
my drug dealing book,

3126
02:13:16,701 --> 02:13:18,290
but this is one of the things that he
says,

3127
02:13:18,650 --> 02:13:20,250
which is that,
you know,

3128
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:22,670
you can be in a,
you know,

3129
02:13:22,671 --> 02:13:26,970
an a poor black neighborhood and a
couple of kids will be on a cell phone

3130
02:13:26,971 --> 02:13:31,971
and talking about selling $10 worth of
weed and there'll be picked up by cops,

3131
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,640
you know,
within 20 minutes or something like

3132
02:13:35,641 --> 02:13:37,110
that.
Meanwhile,

3133
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:38,730
you know,
somebody like,

3134
02:13:38,790 --> 02:13:39,600
uh,
you know,

3135
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:44,600
Bernie madoff can commit hundred million
dollar frauds year after year after year

3136
02:13:45,481 --> 02:13:49,980
and not even do any,
take any effort to try to cover it up

3137
02:13:49,981 --> 02:13:51,990
all that well and get away with it.

3138
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:54,180
Well,
Bernie's big crime was that he ripped

3139
02:13:54,181 --> 02:13:55,360
off rich people.
Yeah,

3140
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:58,110
absolutely.
If he had done the exact same thing to

3141
02:13:58,111 --> 02:14:00,030
poor p,
well what he did was just,

3142
02:14:00,031 --> 02:14:04,260
it was just too easy to call what he did
a crime versus what you were talking

3143
02:14:04,261 --> 02:14:06,840
about with these financial institutions.
Right?

3144
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:07,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

3145
02:14:07,891 --> 02:14:08,850
If he,
if he had lawn,

3146
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,540
if he had laundered it through a
slightly more legitimate process,

3147
02:14:12,541 --> 02:14:14,190
he would have gotten out fine.
But the,

3148
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,560
one of the things that a lot of these
guys,

3149
02:14:17,310 --> 02:14:22,020
these scam artists get into it thinking
that they're actually gonna be real

3150
02:14:22,021 --> 02:14:23,520
hedge funds.
Um,

3151
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:26,190
and that they,
they have some stock pigging system

3152
02:14:26,191 --> 02:14:28,110
that's actually going to make all their
clients Moni.

3153
02:14:28,111 --> 02:14:30,570
And one of the things they find out is
that a,

3154
02:14:30,571 --> 02:14:31,380
they suck.
They,

3155
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:34,170
they,
they're not outperforming the market and

3156
02:14:34,230 --> 02:14:38,670
they're not that smart but be that their
clients can't tell if they just make up

3157
02:14:38,671 --> 02:14:39,504
the numbers.

3158
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:43,050
So there,
there are a number of cases of people

3159
02:14:43,051 --> 02:14:46,860
who start out trying to be legitimate
and trying to be real,

3160
02:14:46,890 --> 02:14:50,590
real investment advisors,
but they just ended up turning into

3161
02:14:50,610 --> 02:14:53,850
Bernie madoff types because it's just
easy.

3162
02:14:53,851 --> 02:14:55,010
There's no there,
there,

3163
02:14:55,110 --> 02:14:57,060
there aren't that many people watching
for it.

3164
02:14:57,330 --> 02:15:00,150
And uh,
you know that that's kind of scary too.

3165
02:15:00,330 --> 02:15:03,990
Well,
it seems like there's so many people

3166
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:06,720
doing it.
How could there be enough people

3167
02:15:06,721 --> 02:15:07,610
watching it?
Right?

3168
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:10,500
Think about how many investment firms
there are and how many different people

3169
02:15:10,501 --> 02:15:15,030
that are involved in trading.
How could anybody be watching all of it,

3170
02:15:15,170 --> 02:15:15,990
right?
Yeah.

3171
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:16,950
No,
they're there.

3172
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:22,100
But the evens even so even if you take
that into consideration,

3173
02:15:22,651 --> 02:15:24,570
then the,
then the number of eyes that are,

3174
02:15:24,571 --> 02:15:27,660
that are on this world is,
is ridiculously low.

3175
02:15:27,661 --> 02:15:29,730
Like take,
take Aig.

3176
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:33,680
Aig was one of the world's largest,
uh,

3177
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:36,510
companies that before,
before it crashed,

3178
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:38,880
it had like 180,000 employees.

3179
02:15:39,210 --> 02:15:41,370
Um,
it was,

3180
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:45,210
it took advantage of this.
We are loophole that allows financial

3181
02:15:45,211 --> 02:15:47,850
companies to essentially choose their
own regulator.

3182
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:50,820
Um,
so because,

3183
02:15:51,210 --> 02:15:54,780
because aig had a thrift or a savings
and loan,

3184
02:15:54,781 --> 02:15:59,781
that's basically the same thing.
They chose to be regulated by the Ots,

3185
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:03,930
which is the office of thrift
supervision,

3186
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:06,420
which is this tiny,
tiny little,

3187
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:08,330
um,
uh,

3188
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:11,580
you know,
office in Washington that overseas

3189
02:16:11,581 --> 02:16:14,880
basically savings and loan operations.
And in,

3190
02:16:15,330 --> 02:16:17,280
in the Ots,
this is,

3191
02:16:17,281 --> 02:16:19,170
this is actually true.
The,

3192
02:16:19,230 --> 02:16:22,740
they had exactly one insurance expert on
staff.

3193
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:28,100
So essentially what the world's largest
insurance company was being regulated by

3194
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:32,920
a government office that only had one
person who really understood insurance

3195
02:16:32,921 --> 02:16:33,940
and,
and even,

3196
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:37,980
and even that person wouldn't have
understood the,

3197
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:43,000
the part of the company that blew up,
which was essentially an investment bank

3198
02:16:43,301 --> 02:16:47,350
within the insurance company that was
creating these sort of highly advanced

3199
02:16:47,351 --> 02:16:49,930
sort of derivative operations,
um,

3200
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:54,220
that know that they just would not have
been able to understand that stuff.

3201
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:59,220
So
the government just does not place a lot

3202
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:02,300
of resources into,
you know,

3203
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:05,590
keeping an eye on even the most basic
things.

3204
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:09,190
And when you compare that to law
enforcement and other areas,

3205
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:11,050
you know,
is how many,

3206
02:17:11,051 --> 02:17:13,810
how many people do we have,
you know,

3207
02:17:13,811 --> 02:17:16,270
worrying about bank bank robberies in
this country or,

3208
02:17:16,271 --> 02:17:18,460
or drugs,
right.

3209
02:17:18,461 --> 02:17:21,610
Or how many people are,
are being watched because their

3210
02:17:21,611 --> 02:17:24,720
marijuana dealers in other states.
I mean it,

3211
02:17:24,770 --> 02:17:28,150
it dwarfs the number of people who are
watching for economic crimes.

3212
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:31,030
Yeah.
One person,

3213
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:33,490
I just love the,
the name of it.

3214
02:17:33,970 --> 02:17:36,180
Office of thrift supervision.
Yeah.

3215
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:37,001
Yeah,
exactly.

3216
02:17:37,001 --> 02:17:39,280
I'm not even sure it exists anymore.
I think it was,

3217
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:42,500
it was merged into some other,
uh,

3218
02:17:43,060 --> 02:17:47,680
cause there used to be the OCC officer
of the comptroller of the currency and I

3219
02:17:47,681 --> 02:17:51,730
think they created a new regulator out
out of all of that after the crash.

3220
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:53,230
But,
um,

3221
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:55,810
but yeah,
Aig shows it's regulator and it's

3222
02:17:55,811 --> 02:17:57,310
regulator,
you know,

3223
02:17:57,370 --> 02:17:59,200
was totally overmatched,
didn't,

3224
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:02,620
couldn't understand shit.
And that's one of the reasons why the

3225
02:18:02,621 --> 02:18:05,500
company blew up.
The company also bill up because it was

3226
02:18:05,501 --> 02:18:10,501
run by insurance people who didn't
understand it.

3227
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:13,330
I do,
is basically Wall Street's bookie,

3228
02:18:13,331 --> 02:18:16,270
all these people were betting all of
these investment banks were betting on

3229
02:18:16,271 --> 02:18:18,520
whether or not mortgages we're going to
fail or not.

3230
02:18:18,970 --> 02:18:22,720
And Aig was selling the product that
they could use,

3231
02:18:23,150 --> 02:18:25,540
uh,
to make those bets essentially.

3232
02:18:25,541 --> 02:18:29,230
Or there were taking on insurance on,
on packets of mortgages.

3233
02:18:29,231 --> 02:18:32,050
So if they exploded,
you would get a payout,

3234
02:18:32,260 --> 02:18:33,730
right?
Uh,

3235
02:18:33,850 --> 02:18:34,930
it was,
it's like,

3236
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:37,330
it's like buying an insurance policy on
your neighbor's house.

3237
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:39,100
If it goes up in flames,
you get paid,

3238
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:42,610
you get paid.
Aig was selling a product that allowed

3239
02:18:42,611 --> 02:18:47,020
banks essentially to buy insurance on,
on houses,

3240
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:48,310
on mortgages.

3241
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:50,590
And if the,
if people foreclosed,

3242
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:55,570
if the mortgage is failed or pools of
mortgages failed,

3243
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:57,370
uh,
if you,

3244
02:18:57,371 --> 02:19:00,130
if you bought that kind of insurance,
you got these huge payouts.

3245
02:19:00,131 --> 02:19:03,370
So people were betting against mortgages
basically.

3246
02:19:03,430 --> 02:19:07,780
And Aig was taking all this book and,
but the,

3247
02:19:07,810 --> 02:19:11,320
the heads of the company were old school
insurance executives and just didn't

3248
02:19:11,321 --> 02:19:15,810
understand this sort of new fangled,
um,

3249
02:19:16,330 --> 02:19:20,980
complicated form of insurance.
And so they would look at the numbers

3250
02:19:20,981 --> 02:19:23,230
that they were being given.
And even they didn't get it.

3251
02:19:23,290 --> 02:19:25,090
They didn't,
they didn't understand how,

3252
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:28,970
how exposed they were.
And so when all of the bet started going

3253
02:19:28,971 --> 02:19:32,120
the wrong way,
suddenly they're being asked to pay out

3254
02:19:32,630 --> 02:19:34,930
billions of dollars and they're like,
well,

3255
02:19:35,270 --> 02:19:36,620
wait,
where is this coming from?

3256
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:38,900
So,
so even the companies were kind of

3257
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:41,540
clueless about the shit that was going
on.

3258
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:43,230
It turns out,
well,

3259
02:19:44,210 --> 02:19:45,170
listen,
man,

3260
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:49,550
if it wasn't for you,
dummies like me would not understand why

3261
02:19:49,551 --> 02:19:50,450
we should be scared.

3262
02:19:51,220 --> 02:19:55,010
Like everybody was scared.
But reading your,

3263
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:57,740
your articles about it,
maybe understand why.

3264
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:01,070
And I think that's a,
the way he described it as great,

3265
02:20:01,071 --> 02:20:04,250
that you translated this stuff.
You actually worked at as trash as a

3266
02:20:04,251 --> 02:20:05,810
translator.
And,

3267
02:20:05,811 --> 02:20:06,920
uh,
I appreciate your work,

3268
02:20:06,921 --> 02:20:07,460
man.
Oh,

3269
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:09,680
thank you so much for him to have been a
huge fan forever.

3270
02:20:09,690 --> 02:20:11,750
I'm looking forward to seeing your
special,

3271
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:13,780
I mean,
you have,

3272
02:20:13,790 --> 02:20:14,580
uh,
yeah,

3273
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:16,400
it's going to come out sometime around
September.

3274
02:20:16,401 --> 02:20:17,780
I think that's when they're gonna
release it.

3275
02:20:17,810 --> 02:20:18,950
Excellent.
Thank you,

3276
02:20:18,951 --> 02:20:19,790
man.
Really appreciate it.

3277
02:20:19,791 --> 02:20:20,360
Thank you,
Matt.

3278
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:21,200
Thanks for coming on,
man.

3279
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:22,580
Thank you very much,
Matt.

3280
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:23,810
Taibbi ladies and gentlemen.

3281
02:20:26,110 --> 02:20:31,110
