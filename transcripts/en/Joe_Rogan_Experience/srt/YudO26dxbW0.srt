1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,130
Sam,
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:04,080
we are live.
Goddammit.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,200
We are live with the man.
Jason May Have Miller.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,050
I'm strikeforce fame,
bully beatdown fame.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,570
Fame.
For sure man.

6
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,550
I can't go anywhere.
Let's try force fame to man.

7
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:15,780
You fought for the fucking title.
Yeah,

8
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:16,520
that's true.
But.

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,710
But you know like strike forces in the 
process of building.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,820
Like I could feel them like get the ball
rolling before we even talk.

11
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:26,790
We have to thank our sponsor.
We're sponsored by the fleshlight.

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,090
I left.
That's the butthole version.

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,510
I think that's what other version is.
There's a,

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,500
there's a mouth version and jj version 
now do the bounce coming.

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,530
Different races.
That's an excellent point because I was 

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,341
saying,
how come there's no black ones because 

17
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:46,341
all the vagina is or pink.
If you go to the website,

18
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:50,570
we're going to talk to them about that.
And the funny thing is the dude who 

19
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:50,610
hooked us up,
the dude who started this whole deal,

20
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:53,520
our friend Chris,
seems like he's a mixed heritage,

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:53,980
right?

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,870
It doesn't mean he seems like he's like,
he's got a bunch of things going to say,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,500
a little bit of black and white ones had
some black something somewhere along the

24
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:02,730
line.
Let's represent.

25
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:07,731
He's a spiritual traveler.
You can tell by just talking to that 

26
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:10,420
guy.
I can't believe you guys doesn't have 

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,780
like Indian dance.
We're going to have him on the podcast 

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:12,780
if he'll do it.
He's.

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,270
I liked that makes the molds of girls' 
vaginas,

30
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,910
like porno stars.
They'd like,

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,570
they literally mold their vagina,
like the outside of it.

32
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:22,430
Stick a flashlight it better and take 
them off.

33
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:23,690
But there was no.
They like put like,

34
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:25,110
yes,
they put something on it,

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,090
you know,
and they make an impression of it.

36
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,970
But every one of those is an official 
vagina.

37
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:34,971
There's like,
or maybe there's just some fat chick 

38
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:34,971
who's her vagina and she's like some 
designer.

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,380
She went to art school for three years 
and then she goes,

40
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,160
puts this stuff on there.
Like now everybody will get.

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,540
My point about the flush side has always
been,

42
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,150
it does not have to look like a vagina 
because I'm not looking at it.

43
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,320
I'm just shoving it on my desk.
I got a free fake vagina.

44
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,720
One time.
You stare at it while you're fucking.

45
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:52,170
I'm like,
wow,

46
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,750
that looks like a wheel vagina.
There's no way you're going to be turned

47
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,010
on.
If it was a real vagina.

48
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,420
Okay.
Why is it by itself?

49
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,760
No fucking body.
I know what I mean.

50
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:01,370
That's creepy.
If you just fuck it.

51
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:06,371
A vagina like some.
Someone took an apple core to some 

52
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:06,730
chicken,
just pulled it off and out.

53
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,760
In personality wise,
most chicks that I've ever dated are 

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,230
pretty much just a vagina.
I just see that part already.

55
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,790
Oh,
you've had some cool chicks.

56
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,230
Well,
yeah,

57
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,170
that's true.
But you know,

58
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:18,480
I've gone through a rash of a 
psychopath,

59
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,670
but.
Well there's no.

60
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,610
That's the lifestyle though.
You know,

61
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:23,910
that's how you're living.
You're a fucking wild man.

62
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:28,911
Like professional.
There's a lot of people out there 

63
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:30,741
claiming wild man.
Jason May Have Miller's a real fucking 

64
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:30,741
wild man.
All right.

65
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:31,290
I can't help it.
Shut the fuck up.

66
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,870
You're talking about a dude who,
as long as I've known him,

67
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,170
has been living in hotels,
he doesn't even.

68
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,860
He's now,
he just got a fucking house now.

69
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:42,861
He has to please God the MTV style.
Well I have to just because like I feel 

70
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,660
like when you're like,
I'm damn near 30 years,

71
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:48,890
like have I been here?
Like buy a house or a TV star now man,

72
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,430
you're legit TV star.
You're,

73
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,530
you're the host of bully fucking beat 
down.

74
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:54,240
That's true.
That's a giant show man.

75
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:58,400
That is a cultural thing.
Like I'm just waiting to get made fun of

76
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,380
like.
I'm like please,

77
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,100
somebody

78
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,420
thought it lives make fun of this 
because it will happen.

79
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,850
It shouldn't.
I mean they can,

80
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,970
they can do that to Anthony Bourdain and
they can do that to you if you go to 

81
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,591
any,
any like MTV parties where you have to 

82
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:13,591
hang out with the Yo.
Nah,

83
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:17,650
they don't let me around those guys and 
they separate me from Jersey shore but I

84
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:20,350
really think.
But you might smack them around.

85
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,730
Might brought my career because I'll be 
beaten up about mayhem.

86
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,050
Like I've known him for a long time now 
and May.

87
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,940
I was one of the coolest guys I've ever 
met.

88
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,760
He's a down dude.
He's totally straight,

89
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,600
you never know you.
There's no way.

90
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,000
There's no guessing where you coming 
from,

91
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:42,001
what may him.
But that said homeys got a switch and 

92
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:45,380
every now and then he just decides.
He just decides to.

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,520
We were at the sky bar.
This is classic mayhem and granted,

94
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:53,380
this is years ago,
before he had matured,

95
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:58,381
you were very bored so easily.
When you get crazy you get hyped,

96
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,660
you know,
and there's nothing wrong with that.

97
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,690
That's what makes you a great fighter.
But when you got weird the sky bar and 

98
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,750
we're just having a good fucking time.
All right.

99
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:10,420
We got a buzz on were laughing and 
telling jokes.

100
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,600
It's like mayhem and Brian is there and 
Aria was there and it was just me and 

101
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,840
you and I may have.
I think there was one other guy.

102
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,860
No,
because I already hit around the corner 

103
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:21,860
and was like,
oh my God,

104
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,850
I totally had one other dude with no,
no.

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,570
Anyway,
bottom line.

106
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,340
Is it okay?
Say it's all just us three.

107
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,460
So we're having a great time laughing 
our asses off and mayhem gets hyped and 

108
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,440
decides to sky dive on this bed filled 
with people,

109
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,850
drinking people.

110
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,650
They have these like the waste Chi 
Biros,

111
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,870
skybox wind.
It's got this killer view,

112
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:42,700
right?
It's at the Mondrian has got this killer

113
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:47,701
view and they have these beds laying 
around and people just chill on these 

114
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,881
beds and they lie down and drink.
Well these people just lie in feed up 

115
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,540
hard day at work.
You know what I'm saying?

116
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,930
All girl,
girl,

117
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,090
Girl.
Let me tell a story.

118
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:55,780
Okay.
You got the,

119
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,330
you got the basics.
Rogan told his version.

120
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,640
Here's my version in my head.
Okay.

121
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,860
I'm standing there.
We already been this guy before,

122
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,060
the day before I went with you they for 
and I had a blast.

123
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,150
It was like,
girl this time it was like some people 

124
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,370
there but it wasn't popping off.
Right.

125
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,740
We're talking about having a good time,
but it wasn't like,

126
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,660
it wasn't like the Hollywood party that 
you,

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,000
you imagine.
Right.

128
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,710
And I'd never been to Hollywood.

129
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,270
That was like my first time.
Okay.

130
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,270
So I wanted the Hollywood party,
like I was like,

131
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,680
where's all the hot bitches,
you know,

132
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,150
like what,
what is this?

133
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,110
So,
but you know,

134
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,330
you guys are used to it.
So you were like whatever.

135
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,920
Me,
I was getting bored.

136
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,980
Like I was like man,
where the chicks yesterday where I was 

137
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:37,980
talking to chicks and then I look 
around,

138
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,730
I'm like,
and then as I look around,

139
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,760
there's a lull in our conversation.
I look over and there's a hot chick and 

140
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,980
she's looking at me from the bench now 
be it.

141
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,270
I was on the second level of this little
area and we're sitting there talking.

142
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,510
There's a low in our conversation.
I look back at a chick.

143
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,040
She was smiling.
Something in my head said,

144
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,220
Jason,
she wants you to jump on there.

145
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,770
Now.
I have extensive experience jumping on a

146
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:05,750
couch.
I had a little sister all growing up.

147
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,420
I can run and jump perfect and land 
perfect on the couch.

148
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,040
As I ran and jumped in midair,
I went,

149
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,150
Damn,
this is a bad idea.

150
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,470
Like,
why did I do this?

151
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,940
But too late I could not take it back.
So I jumped in,

152
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,300
smash into these all these hot chicks 
chicks,

153
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,000
like a bunch of rich dudes wear rolex.
The one guy with my bike,

154
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,020
he hair,
he had the full hawk before people had 

155
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,151
full hawks and I smashed it,
knocked the drinks everywhere and 

156
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:38,360
whatever at meant.
I popped up like Bruce Lee,

157
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:41,930
like jumped back up and I was like,
that was stupid.

158
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,540
I saw bouncing bouncers running and I 
just went,

159
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,570
I know,
I know.

160
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,560
I'm sorry.
I know.

161
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:50,561
I know.
And then so this is my first Hollywood 

162
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:51,710
thing and I was hanging out with the 
famous Joe Rogan and I was like,

163
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,510
damn,
Joe Rogan is going to hate me,

164
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,090
man.
Joe was going to hate me.

165
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,970
I hit my phone rang and I saw Joe Rogan 
and I was like,

166
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,030
Oh God.
I answered the phone and he's like,

167
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,970
you were laughing so hard that I was 
like,

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,470
oh cool.
It's cool.

169
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,050
That was awesome.

170
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,200
You kind of know the difference between 
someone,

171
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,480
someone who's capable of doing crazy 
shit,

172
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,080
but he's a cool dude and someone who's 
just fucking crazy and annoying and 

173
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,120
there's a huge difference and you're 
just a dude who a cool dude who will do 

174
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,971
some crazy shit,
but you get labeled in with the other 

175
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:27,580
group all the time.
You get underestimated in my opinion.

176
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,870
You know,
and it was really funny.

177
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,050
The,
as a fighter as well as the EA game,

178
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,230
they put you at a really low skill level
and it was fucking hilarious.

179
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:42,400
Video is hilarious.
Video of him on the Internet.

180
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Punking the EA guys.
He pretends that he's fucking pissed 

181
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:47,640
off.
[inaudible] they put them in a low level

182
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,480
of skill way.
Looks so good.

183
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,150
It's so good.
What?

184
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,110
Find it.
Find it on Youtube.

185
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,150
Google.
What is.

186
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,260
Do you know the name of the video?
I don't know.

187
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,590
Oh,
it just may.

188
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,790
May Freak out.
Something like that.

189
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,230
It's on the

190
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,850
abuse or something.
Super quick.

191
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,990
Super quick.
Ryan.

192
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,760
You got it man.
I get to sit back a little bit.

193
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,360
So here I am.
Whatever.

194
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,530
So it just talk us through this for a 
lot of people.

195
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,410
Just listen to this setup.
Whole deal.

196
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:27,411
We went to ea,
so obviously in the middle that actually

197
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:36,071
one of the this developer.
So if you notice in this video he gets 

198
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,500
fucking slapped around.
Here.

199
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,910
It goes here.
Now he starts realizing,

200
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,640
let me show you a few more characters,
a low skill level.

201
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:52,641
Now you can watch the bro.

202
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,500
What's wrong with bank man?
For you?

203
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,230
What's the buildup?
A big deal to video games.

204
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,380
No,
no,

205
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,120
no,
no,

206
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,400
no man.
No Man.

207
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,170
That's what you pick your.
Yeah.

208
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,170
And then my coach.
No disrespect,

209
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,370
no disrespect.
Yeah.

210
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,710
There was this one dude who was.
There was this one dude who was talking 

211
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,260
who was really.
It sounded really freaked out when you.

212
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,430
When you got violent and physical.
He wasn't in a.

213
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:46,970
no,
no,

214
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,140
no.
My bad.

215
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:48,960
No,
no.

216
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,040
He wasn't in on it.
That,

217
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,130
that was really his freak out.
The whole floor of people came to the 

218
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,581
door and everyone was like,
acting like they're going to do 

219
00:09:59,581 --> 00:09:59,581
something.
I like,

220
00:09:59,581 --> 00:09:59,581
Whoa,
listen to that guy's voice.

221
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:03,640
Could you rewind it to that one spot 
where that one guy wigs this guy.

222
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,350
This is some primal shit,
dude.

223
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,700
You got to listen to his voice that the 
terrorists

224
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,140
boy's what's wrong?
Charges the bank man was a big deal to 

225
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,360
video games.
No,

226
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,140
no,
no,

227
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,810
no,
no man.

228
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,060
No Man.
That's what you paid back your.

229
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

230
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,450
That guy.
That guy sounds like a dude is getting 

231
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:40,450
attacked by a bear.
Scared.

232
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:40,450
Yeah.
Well,

233
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:40,870
you know,
I mean,

234
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,500
and I never think about it,
you know,

235
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:45,670
and I have no fear of physical 
altercation talking to them.

236
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,760
Sorry.
It was that bad,

237
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,140
but I didn't have no fear of physical 
altercation.

238
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:50,690
So to me,
like I'm like,

239
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,740
okay,
whatever.

240
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:52,740
It's a dude,
you know,

241
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:57,741
like,
and I don't really think about the 

242
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:57,741
consequences.
Anyway.

243
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:57,741
I got my.
Well if I get beat up I get beat up,

244
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:57,820
you know,
like,

245
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,200
well the designer wasn't going to fire 
you up.

246
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,250
No,
I wouldn't even attempt that because 

247
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,380
you're mad at him for that.
You think my game sucks.

248
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Fuck you.
What'd you think he was going to attack 

249
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:11,500
you?
No,

250
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,410
no,
no dogs in that race.

251
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,100
You had no worries.
That was very funny though.

252
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,250
It was very funny though.

253
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,360
Real shit with video Joe Rogan.
I enjoy the shit out of it.

254
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,010
May Have Miller.
I enjoy the shit out of it now.

255
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,090
We can't have you on without talking 
about that strikeforce Bra.

256
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,250
Yeah.
That is the most ridiculous shit I've 

257
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,530
ever seen on television.
This is one of the problems and we 

258
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,550
talked about it on the show right after 
it happened with uh,

259
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,200
organizations that they don't have 
enough experience yet.

260
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,820
There's little things they haven't 
covered.

261
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,970
Little things like watching the doors,
like you can't just let anybody in and 

262
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,390
the UFC knows that.
So they have people watching the doors 

263
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,070
trying to get into the cage feed man 
just,

264
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,200
but there's just like a little hole 
missing in their game.

265
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,250
And the whole missing

266
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,830
was you got to watch the door.
You can't just let anybody in the cage.

267
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,940
They just fucked up.
And I thought it was an appropriate time

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,850
to get into case smart.
Oh yeah,

269
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:05,320
for sure.
What's the worst that could happen?

270
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,960
Well,
the worst thing happens so.

271
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,760
Well,
it wouldn't have been bad.

272
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,340
It wouldn't have been bad.
Well,

273
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:16,090
what happened was you came in and 
interrupted in the middle of his speech.

274
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,310
Here's the,
here's how that went.

275
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,080
He looked at you,
I saw what happened.

276
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,170
He looked at you guys made eye contact 
and then you just went with it because 

277
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,180
it was like awkward at that point 
because I,

278
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,450
I,
I didn't mean to step into his frame.

279
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,310
And then he looked back at me and me and
me and uh,

280
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,450
me and shields Kinda had made peace 
already because we're both cutting 

281
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,130
weight at the same time and we're in the
same area.

282
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,860
And we both were like,
oh.

283
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,510
And we're like,
we kind of looked at each other like,

284
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,220
yeah,
we're doing it again.

285
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,210
Like,
what's up Dawg?

286
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,470
Like that.
Like we were like,

287
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,610
alright,
it's cool.

288
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,160
Yeah,
you beat me in the last five.

289
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,250
Give me another shot.
I'll,

290
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,910
I'll,
you know,

291
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:50,040
I'll kick your ass.
And I thought,

292
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,380
you know,
there's mutual respect him.

293
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,450
He respects me and an ad.
So we kind of made our peace and that 

294
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:57,610
the way we still,
we're cool.

295
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,210
We're like,
what up?

296
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,000
Then I won my fight and knock the guy 
out,

297
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:04,150
which this will make a lot more sense if
on the video.

298
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,920
I mean,
all the CBS broadcast,

299
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:07,930
they showed my fight,
but they had five,

300
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:11,570
25 minute fights and went over their 
time slot anyway when way,

301
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,170
way,
way,

302
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,250
way over their time slot.
They went over by like over an hour.

303
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,900
Right.
Wow.

304
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,030
In our planning again,
they're just,

305
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,940
you know,
they're just new at the MMA game.

306
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,030
It's a new thing for them.
Anyway.

307
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,250
Uh,
so I go in there and I didn't mean to 

308
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,250
step into frame.
I stepped in the frame of,

309
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,370
Oh whoops,
I've already had.

310
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,320
He noticed me at that moment.
I was like,

311
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,570
well,
I got to talk now Eddie,

312
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,880
because he asked me,
well you want to rematch it out?

313
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,300
And he said that off the off the mic.
And I went,

314
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,160
yeah,
where'd my rematch buddy?

315
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,670
Woops.
Because then I just proceeded to get to 

316
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,970
stockton dog piled.
And the funniest part is,

317
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,710
is imagine if I just want to fight and 
my camp was in there.

318
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,360
Okay.
My crew,

319
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,010
if we jumped on somebody,
they would be fucking hurt.

320
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,770
I got up like,
oh my God.

321
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:04,300
Like I didn't even get hurt on that.

322
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,130
How did I even get hurt?
You know,

323
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:08,540
like I was shocked.
I didn't even have a scratch on me and,

324
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,710
and I,
during the little scrub I shot a double 

325
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:13,710
leg on somebody because I was like,
man,

326
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,061
let me just take someone on the ground 
and then I can probably get my way out 

327
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:18,061
of this.
And,

328
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:20,770
and because I was thinking at this 
moment you got when you fight,

329
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,530
and my adrenaline had already been 
pumped up earlier that night.

330
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,020
I wasn't even hyped with that.
It was happening.

331
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,920
I was like,
Whoa,

332
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:32,010
oh my God.
And I'd get on the bottom of a dog pile 

333
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,010
and I'm like,
oh,

334
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,750
I'm getting jumped on national 
television.

335
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,320
I got kicked in the head and I didn't 
even feel that.

336
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,730
And as soon as I'm thinking in my head,
man,

337
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:42,580
I'm getting jumped on national 
television to fricking idiot.

338
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,740
Gus Johnson goes,
gentleman,

339
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,570
this was national television.
I'm like,

340
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,270
dude,
that dude is.

341
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,010
He to me is like commentator in the 
fucking you title to your opinion,

342
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:59,720
sir.
Joe Rogan,

343
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,420
who's got nothing bike.
She'll bellow.

344
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,540
Are you fucking kidding me?
Gus Johnson all day.

345
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,630
He sounds like a dude who's in a mold,
just fits and starts talking like a 

346
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:14,090
sports guy.
I'm just got me pregnant.

347
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,860
I.
I wrote a preface for a book this kind 

348
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,340
of like a college textbook.
It's a great book.

349
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,470
It's A.
I can't remember.

350
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,190
Anyway,
it's about the mentality of fighters and

351
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,830
he did case studies with all interviews 
with Gus Johnson.

352
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:34,420
Did this.
No,

353
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,750
no,
no.

354
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,570
How?
How's that guy going to write?

355
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,290
A friend of mine,
he wrote this book and a book called.

356
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,820
I don't know.
Wait a minute.

357
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,810
Wait a minute.
Wait.

358
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,730
It's coming to me.
It's too complicated.

359
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:50,810
That's the problem.
If it was just like fighting or fighting

360
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:51,640
an art,
you know,

361
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,770
it was about that.
It's actually,

362
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,360
you know,
a,

363
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,730
a,
a good book.

364
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:56,990
I don't know.
Look it up.

365
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:01,991
Red Band,
you know how to and fucking fighting and

366
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,560
breakfast.
I'm sure it's on Amazon or something 

367
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:08,560
like that.
May Have prefaces.

368
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,620
You never know.
Man.

369
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,090
I wrote this thing where at the 
beginning,

370
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,470
and I drew the parallel.
Oh,

371
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:20,471
but Mascara probably come here.
We have a technical difficulties with 

372
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,220
the wiener dog.
Dog,

373
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:27,230
dog.
My cats in the room.

374
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,820
My cat's hiding in the closet.
The wiener dog found them.

375
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,450
We got goddamn problems.
What kind of fucking professional 

376
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:37,760
studios.
But I had a buddy.

377
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,380
You can't go down there.
Come on here.

378
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:44,060
Hey,
I'm going to call gentlemen.

379
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:47,440
We apologize,
but I,

380
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,650
you know,
it's got to be a pretty big coincidence 

381
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:52,650
if,
if he just,

382
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,280
he just.
Sorry guys.

383
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,550
Yo,
Yo,

384
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,130
Yo,
check it out.

385
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,810
Podcast son.
But uh,

386
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,020
we have the widest spot anyway for the 
people who haven't seen this.

387
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:13,010
This is what happened.
There was a fight is over google.

388
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,920
Google number one.
Listen to this.

389
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,020
Listen to this podcast at,
don't know shit about mma.

390
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,910
There's most of the people that listen 
to this podcast,

391
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,640
I would say probably 50 percent at least
I know.

392
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,830
I love it.
Comedy fans,

393
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,850
people driving a work.
This I just,

394
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,280
just for the people who who are not mma 
fans,

395
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:36,660
we just have to clean it again.
Get it,

396
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,680
get over here.
This is very distracting.

397
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:40,370
Anyway,
sorry.

398
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,470
Why don't you guys talk for a second.
Let me shut this door.

399
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,940
Please shut the door.
By the way,

400
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,170
remember that couch story?
You're talking about the Sky Bar?

401
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,180
Yeah.
That was like my first month in La and 

402
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,180
it was like my first

403
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,520
time at an La bar and then at meets you.
And then when that happened,

404
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,450
I just remember it turned into bullet 
time where I just see girls like fucking

405
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,620
glasses of wine every call that saving 
private Ryan,

406
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,700
you're like looking around everything 
because it black and white and slow 

407
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:07,700
motion.
And then I ran around the corner.

408
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,140
Me and Joe hid from you.
Oh Man.

409
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:13,580
I knew.
I knew it was going down there.

410
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,370
I'm like,
Damn,

411
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:17,010
I'm an idiot man.
Like I do stupid shit all the time,

412
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:19,260
but this is really stupid.
And I was like,

413
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,290
man,
I finally have a famous friend in my 

414
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:24,920
entire life and I tell them to fuck off 
exception.

415
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,130
Oh,
not yet.

416
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:28,650
Everybody says all the time,
we got to keep talking.

417
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:30,380
Hold on a second before we changed the 
dinner.

418
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,030
You're ready.
I'm gonna.

419
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:31,940
Go see it tonight,
Bill.

420
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:32,730
For sure.
Do it.

421
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,960
We're not done.
Why?

422
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Partially because at red band tweeted,
like Maddie was stroking himself.

423
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:43,980
Why he was writing this review like 140 
characters of.

424
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,070
Oh Shit.
Oh God.

425
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:49,000
Like before,
before we get full years old,

426
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,900
we've got to go back

427
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,060
this whole strikeforce thing for your 
dog.

428
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,200
Cat.
Sorry.

429
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,110
We got issues.
You got wild kingdom going on up in this

430
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:57,210
pitch.
Um,

431
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,970
so the,
the,

432
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,400
the strikeforce thing.
So for the people who haven't seen it,

433
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:01,870
this is what happens.
One guy wins.

434
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:06,871
And this guy who want jake shields 
mayhem and jake shields had fought in 

435
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:07,450
the past very close decision as matter 
of fact,

436
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,510
at the end of the second round was the 
second or the third or the end of the 

437
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,651
second and third,
he had them locked up in a rear naked 

438
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:16,651
choke and homeboy was going asleep.

439
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,550
Hold him.
After the bell was my last fight.

440
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,670
I illegally kicked Jacques Rey in his 
head and I was like,

441
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,720
Ooh,
I don't want to get the.

442
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,690
Everybody hates me because I'm a dirty 
ass fighter,

443
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:30,120
you know,
so I didn't even hold onto it and beyond

444
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:31,560
the bell because I was like,
I'll get up.

445
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:32,100
He would have went to

446
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,180
sleep and he was,
he was a couple of seconds away from 

447
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,180
going to sleep.
It was woulda,

448
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,580
Coulda,
shoulda deadlocked on.

449
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,810
Anyway,
so the point is,

450
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,280
there was a,
they had a big,

451
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:41,660
very close fight.
It was very,

452
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:44,660
it was exciting and a mayhem doesn't 
feel like he did his best,

453
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:47,750
which no fighter ever does.
So he wanted to have this rematch.

454
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:51,680
So when Jake shields one and a big 
victory over Dan Henderson may him says,

455
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,090
well,
this is a good way to hype the fight up.

456
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,740
This would be a big name fight.
You know,

457
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:59,180
I may have Miller from MTV and bully 
beat down and we're on fucking CBS right

458
00:19:59,181 --> 00:19:59,930
now.
You know,

459
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:00,410
I'm,
I'm,

460
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,080
I'm a famous MMA guy.
You're a famous MMA guy.

461
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,330
You just had a huge victory.
Let's make some money.

462
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,460
Let's make some fucking money.
That's exactly,

463
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,430
let's get fucking.

464
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,490
Come on,
let's get crazy.

465
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,690
Come on,
let's hype this up.

466
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:16,691
You've got to get mad at me.
But the problem is everybody took it 

467
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:18,350
street.
Everybody went goofy like,

468
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:23,351
come on man.
You guys have to have some sort of an 

469
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:26,051
understanding that there's a certain 
amount of shit you should be able to 

470
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:26,300
talk before you throw it down because 
it's good for business.

471
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,360
It's good for business.
What's not good for businesses,

472
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,540
punting people in the headway down.
Just I understand where you're coming 

473
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:34,540
from.
You want to back up your boy,

474
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,351
but you can't do that on TV.
You got to realize that a lot of this 

475
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:39,740
disrespect and the shit talking,
it's not real.

476
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,350
A little bit,
a little bit like I said,

477
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,050
being hammer and deb locker room,
we suffer together.

478
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,460
This reality

479
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,080
like the reality is,
you know,

480
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:51,910
it was a great fight.
The reality is,

481
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:56,911
you know,
you would like to get back in there and 

482
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:56,911
the reality is,
you know,

483
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:56,911
you think you can beat them.
You can't close to tapping.

484
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:58,840
So,
so there's a lot of real hype to it,

485
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,580
but there's always respect,
like the,

486
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,620
the,
all the bullshit and the shit talking 

487
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,891
and everything like that.
What people have to understand is that 

488
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,440
makes you money.
That sells the fucking fights.

489
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,880
That's a big,
big thing.

490
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,090
Like Rashad and rampage man.
If neither one of those guys said a word

491
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:14,620
to each other,
that wouldn't have been happy.

492
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,240
Emotional black guy fight.
Who Cares?

493
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,510
But I'm just saying they hyped it up.
Yes,

494
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,800
they made realistic.
There's some reality to it,

495
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:28,801
but they kept the shit together.
They got so close on that ultimate 

496
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:28,801
fighter show,
man,

497
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:30,790
when they got in each other's face and 
touching noses.

498
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,600
Australia,
I'm friends with both guys.

499
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,750
I'm friends with both of those as a 
minor because they're cool guys.

500
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:39,930
They're both great guys.
I grew up with rampage.

501
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,270
Basically when I moved to California and
my damn van,

502
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,050
I like bay.
I,

503
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,000
I lived in the parking lot down the 
street from his house and would drive to

504
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,010
go pick them up,
take them to another gym to train.

505
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Everyday we hung out everyday it.
Which one conversation that he 

506
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,180
remembers?
I went,

507
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,520
man,
you should be Mr.

508
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,060
t on it on the 18th.
And then he started spitting.

509
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:02,670
That appeared.
It was done.

510
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,150
I like that.
And I was like,

511
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,790
whoa.
My,

512
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,700
your see I told you didn't magic mayhem 
five,

513
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,280
eight years later.
Got Traction type shit son.

514
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,110
Yeah,
exactly.

515
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:17,140
Anyway,
maybe I'm just magic Joe Rogan.

516
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,000
Maybe he's just really saw God just 
blessed me.

517
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:24,880
I got to know me and shit.

518
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,790
Hey.
Anyway,

519
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,800
up.
So we're in Australia and those guys 

520
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,921
were both out there and I'm kind of 
kicking it with both of them going 

521
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:35,540
around to Australia's nightlife and uh,
I'm,

522
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,340
I'm kind of hanging out more with 
rampage.

523
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,560
I'd known him for a way longer and 
whatever.

524
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,600
And I kinda,
you know,

525
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:42,190
I haven't seen him.
We were catching up and,

526
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,640
and anyway,
he a Villi.

527
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,800
These guys,
suddenly I'm in the nightclub with some 

528
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:49,800
hot chicks.
I'm looking around like,

529
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:49,800
wow,
hot chicks,

530
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,130
cool.
This is what life's supposed to be.

531
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:56,131
Right?
And security starts running past me and 

532
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm like,
where's rampage?

533
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,860
And I like looked over at and where were
shod with city,

534
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,510
where's Rashad?
And I was like,

535
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,500
dude,
they're not here.

536
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,890
And those guys were running.
I run down to this little tiny hallway 

537
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,060
where the bathroom was and who's 
standing there face to face in this 

538
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,820
hallway that I could barely fit down.
They are face to face in this thing.

539
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,610
Just black guy talking like little 
motherfucker.

540
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,830
A motherfucker like I all I could hear 
as much as people bitch.

541
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,690
And here we go.
I was like,

542
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,520
aw dude,
these,

543
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,090
these security is like locked.
They know who these guys are.

544
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,850
They know what can go down right now.
They're just like,

545
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,740
ah,
fuck.

546
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,880
Could you imagine to the restroom at a 
fucking club in Australia?

547
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,210
Sydney people are cool as fuck.
Yeah,

548
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,070
like people are nice here.
How hard it to be a bouncer,

549
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,000
you know,
no big deal.

550
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,750
And then one day to fucking cage 
fighters,

551
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,740
fabens fighting one of the biggest rival
reason the history of the UFC.

552
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:59,741
And these two guys are in each other's 
face in your bar and you've got to do 

553
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:02,321
something to the rescue.
I sprint the doubt in their gap between 

554
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:07,001
him and explained to them in the 
language that I'm accustomed to black 

555
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,000
guy because I can talk black guy,
black guy.

556
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,300
Oh,
give us,

557
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,010
give us an exact interpretation of what 
a normal black guys,

558
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,030
this black guy.
Like I,

559
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:14,660
I,
I,

560
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,480
my formative years were spent with all 
black guys.

561
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,800
My front 12.
Well I moved to a less black 

562
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,420
neighborhood when I was 12 and whatever 
it was still does.

563
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,500
I still hung out with black kids because
I was already used to that.

564
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,200
Like I was just like,
you know,

565
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,020
that was just my normal guy.
What's it feel like?

566
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,860
So,
you know what I mean.

567
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,400
Hey,
get outta here.

568
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,590
So anyway,
I get it.

569
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,300
These guys faces and like,
Hey man,

570
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,790
let's do this on TV.
Huh?

571
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,140
Why are you guys gonna waste the right 
here because international incident they

572
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,040
kinda like broke off and Kinda like 
laughed the fact that screaming about an

573
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:50,210
international incident and disaster 
averted.

574
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,410
But like they were furious.
Yeah.

575
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,390
They were like,
I was like,

576
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,420
you guys are really a couple of drinks.
These guys get fired up.

577
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:56,710
Well,

578
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,610
there's a psychological advantage of not
getting the other guy,

579
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,350
you know,
not backing down at all.

580
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,840
It's so important to those guys and they
understand that.

581
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:10,010
I mean,
it seems stupid and I think it is kind 

582
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,010
of dumb,
you know,

583
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,350
but I understand it 100 percent and you 
know,

584
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:16,351
look,
when people get heated in to each 

585
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:16,351
other's faces and you know,
and there's this,

586
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:20,670
especially with two guys that are about 
to fight these little tiny battles are 

587
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,601
real.
These little tiny psychological battles 

588
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:24,601
like who gets to tell who to go fuck 
themselves last,

589
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:26,350
you know,
who gets to say the last word?

590
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,310
You know,
it's like,

591
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:28,840
fuck man,
we might be here all day.

592
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:31,620
I'm not going anywhere fucking on 
getting that real man.

593
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:34,310
I am so not.
Why would you want to get yourself that?

594
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:35,170
That's true.
It's true.

595
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,200
But if you're a cage fighter,
it's a different situation because 

596
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,620
psychological warfare,
it's very important.

597
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,620
It's very important.
Your mindset as opposed to where their 

598
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:46,620
mindset is.
When,

599
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,811
when the fight starts,
you can fuck someone's head up in the 

600
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:53,251
preflight,
but there's a lot of fighters that are 

601
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:53,251
awesome,
believe in,

602
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:53,260
just like I love you.
That's all nice and good,

603
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,570
but everybody's got their own style,
right?

604
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,400
You can't hate on someone's shit-talking
stop because it really works,

605
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:58,540
man.
There's some,

606
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,100
there's some shit,
man,

607
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,800
when you get inside someone's head and 
get them emotional.

608
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:06,850
And I'll start talking shit about their 
girlfriend talking shit about their kids

609
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:08,340
talking shit about their life.
You,

610
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,890
you start fuck.
And look,

611
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,220
some people can take it.
Some people who talk shit,

612
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:14,080
um,
and they think it's funny and it doesn't

613
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:16,270
hurt them,
but some guys go crazy.

614
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,540
Look at fucking Frank Mir.
When Brock Lesnar Frank Mir his face 

615
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,810
after he beat the fuck out of him,
after he beat his fucking face into the 

616
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,910
ground to smashed him,
then he gets in his face doc.

617
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,940
So fucking shit.

618
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,090
Use

619
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,090
that for motivation.
That,

620
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,400
that was real man.
That was,

621
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,100
that was,
uh,

622
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:35,950
a real anger.
You know,

623
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,800
that guy got fucking furious because 
that,

624
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,910
it backfired on him.
But it works on other girls.

625
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,030
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

626
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,770
Backfired.

627
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,140
Well,
I think that people got sad that.

628
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,110
No,
no,

629
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:48,470
no,
no,

630
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:48,840
no,
no,

631
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,340
no.
I mean as far as his performance,

632
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,590
his performance,
all the shit talking to backfire.

633
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,800
I just think that that had nothing to do
with property is going to be bigger and 

634
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,400
stronger and bigger groups.
But what I'm saying is it didn't do any 

635
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,410
good.
He got it more of a beating,

636
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,460
you know what I'm saying?
I mean,

637
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,970
and he got really.
He got real anger behind shit out of me.

638
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,380
Then they let me off easy,
you know,

639
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:13,970
I,
I to,

640
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,210
if I lost,
I had lost.

641
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,130
I want to lose.
I don't want to like,

642
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,110
Oh,
you hugged me into the Damn Bat.

643
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,660
I wonder like,
did you see the IFC,

644
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:22,290
the,
uh,

645
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,860
Josh Barnett Dranamo dose?
I didn't see you like stoppage,

646
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,300
man.
I mean,

647
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,840
Josh Barnett was crushing them.
No,

648
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:28,530
don't get me wrong.

649
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,560
You mean it's definitely just.
But I was thinking like,

650
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:32,430
wow,
I don't know.

651
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:37,431
I think Brock Lester took more shots 
than than this guy and the guy got up 

652
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:38,220
and he was really pissed and he 
protested was like,

653
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:40,530
what the fuck?
And granted Barnett was killing them.

654
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:41,970
Don't get me wrong.
Barnett looked awesome.

655
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,200
I mean he been at fucking Barnett as I 
loved the officiating and the Lesnar 

656
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:51,510
fight listener.
I'm a supercar one fan.

657
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:53,940
Like I love him as well.
He's the best guy.

658
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,560
Look,
I'm a fan of anybody who can.

659
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,830
When Brock lesner showed his character 
and coming back for that second round,

660
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:01,830
but he took a lot of shots where I was 
looking at big John,

661
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:06,831
who I think is the best of business.
I think big John and herb dean at the 

662
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:07,620
very best and big but big.
John stopped that fight in Australia.

663
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,620
It was like,
I wonder who would have stopped the 

664
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:12,620
lesnar fight?
People would have stopped it.

665
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Yeah.
I know.

666
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,170
Most of all is the shit.
That guy is one of the best.

667
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:18,570
Rosenthal.
Rosenthal is the shed.

668
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,040
He's a real fan.
He trains.

669
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:25,041
He's a brown belt in Jujitsu.
What about understanding what her dean 

670
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:25,890
is the shit.
He's my dean is stellar,

671
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,440
outstanding,
coolest motherfucker on the planet.

672
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:33,441
You both guys are and you know,
but I don't think either one of those 

673
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:33,441
guys could have stopped it.
Maybe.

674
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:35,810
Maybe herb herb might have stopped now.
I don't think he would have.

675
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,310
Somebody might have no one from the 
matrix is going to stop.

676
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,740
That is a great referee,
but he might've stopped it.

677
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,210
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

678
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,720
There's a few.
I mean what I'm trying to get at is that

679
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,460
moments like that you realize how 
important the referee really is.

680
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,860
Yeah.
The thing is that,

681
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,320
I don't know.
I don't think he should have been 

682
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,320
stopped because he was taking a beating 
for sure,

683
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,220
but if you look at the athletes face,
you have to like pay attention to their 

684
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,470
facial expression and there if they 
don't look like they want out of there,

685
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,370
why stop it?
Like I never once can remember.

686
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,560
I remember getting my ass kicked a 
couple of times.

687
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:13,140
Like I like getting kicked and I 
remember thinking,

688
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,210
don't stop this fight.
Like don't stop it.

689
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,740
I'm still here.
Don't worry.

690
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:21,741
I'm still here and keeping my faith.
But that's an extra thing to think 

691
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:21,741
about,
right?

692
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:21,840
Well,
yeah,

693
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:24,120
I mean,
but I just know in my head,

694
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:29,121
don't stop the fight because I could 
tell it a couple of bites I been and 

695
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:29,450
where I'm getting my ass whooped,
I could tell.

696
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,060
I'm like,
Whoa,

697
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,830
I'm getting kicked my ass kicked right 
now.

698
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,560
I got to hurry up and get out of this 
situation and I.

699
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:35,840
But at the same time,
begin.

700
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Don't stop.
Please don't stop the fight because I'm 

701
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,680
still here.
Have you talked to the Diaz brothers or 

702
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Melendez and anybody

703
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,690
that was involved in his truck for 
Thrall Melendez?

704
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,670
Yeah,
he's cool.

705
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Like it would be an email that does been
cooled at buddies on and I was actually 

706
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,390
kind of friends with Nate Diaz despite 
being nick never getting along because 

707
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,720
you think you guys can all squash.
Oh,

708
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:58,000
you don't get along with nick.
Fuck Nick Diaz.

709
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,700
Whoa.
Long words.

710
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,650
I said it anyway.
What is your problem?

711
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,130
No,
because you know what?

712
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:08,210
I feel like he was a driving factor in 
that whole thing.

713
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,240
He's the first guy to throw a punch.
He started that whole thing and it,

714
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,590
it's almost not as fault because he's 
retarded,

715
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:20,740
but at the same time and he embodies 
this cultural shift that we had and,

716
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:26,170
and we really,
really started with Dr Dre selling us 

717
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,501
Nwa and it did add saunas.
This culture of gangster is cool.

718
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,980
Gangster is cool in a way to watch a 
movie,

719
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,370
but being gangster is just being a 
little kid,

720
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,690
you know what I mean?
And,

721
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,760
and starting a big brawl because what?
I talked some shit to your homie that is

722
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:46,480
just ghetto and that,
that,

723
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,700
that thing embodies what's wrong with 
the paragard right now.

724
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,130
People don't take it.
Like when they asked him about it,

725
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:53,820
I came out and apologized.
Uh,

726
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:55,820
right after that whole thing went down 
because I was wrong.

727
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,070
I stepped into the cage,
but no one stopped me.

728
00:30:58,071 --> 00:31:00,920
I figured that they won't mind.
It'll be cool.

729
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,420
That'd be a cool way to.
Amanda.

730
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,720
Come on,
man.

731
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,930
You figured myself.
Sorry.

732
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,260
Anyway,
so you know,

733
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:09,820
I,
I got,

734
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:15,010
I got in there,
he jumped on me that that's not the 

735
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,320
proper response.
Like,

736
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,730
you know,
you don't act like a damn Brian.

737
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,120
Come on

738
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,990
in the middle of the speech pattern.
Yeah.

739
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:27,110
So I mean,
you,

740
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,350
you had talked to nick in the past 
though,

741
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:31,320
you guys pop was,
is that right?

742
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Nick will after one fight I did pretty 
good because after one of these,

743
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,980
one of his fights I was doing the post 
fight interview Miller with.

744
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,190
That's usually I did.
I didn't know setup.

745
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,630
It was like a silly and it's just a 
joke,

746
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:52,660
like he didn't get the joke though.
That's the problem he was just fucking 

747
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:52,660
with.
He's like a serious dude,

748
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,680
you know?
He's like,

749
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,270
dude,
you know what I mean?

750
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,850
Like,
look,

751
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,780
I liked Nick Diaz a lot.
I'm a big fan of him as a fighter.

752
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,350
I've always been cool with him person.
I thought he was great.

753
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,240
Hey listen,
what do you mean?

754
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,550
What is it about him?
That whole no,

755
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,320
no fun,
no fun and games.

756
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,060
That's,
that's a weird way to live because he 

757
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,060
just is.
He's,

758
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,060
he's,
I don't know,

759
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,790
he's just angry with himself,
so he just,

760
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,860
he takes.
It's rare that someone is so 

761
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,010
disciplined,
like as disciplined his hands.

762
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,130
I mean Nick Diaz is in tremendous shape 
just running and cardio guy works really

763
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:36,311
hard obviously.
He's so good now to man his last few 

764
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:36,311
fights,
man,

765
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:36,311
the fucking Scott Smith's fight.

766
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:38,480
I was really impressed.
Frank shamrock.

767
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:39,760
I was like,
God damn.

768
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,720
He's like,
he's fucking putting it together.

769
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:43,390
He's putting it on people.
I like that.

770
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,360
But,
but as like a dude like that whole,

771
00:32:46,361 --> 00:32:48,830
like always angry and always fighting.
It's,

772
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:49,970
you know,
it's unfortunate.

773
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,430
It's unfortunate way of looking at 
whatever,

774
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,900
you know.
That's just the mentality of some people

775
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:55,180
and I think that,
you know,

776
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,710
it's weird.
You see that in someone who's so good at

777
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:00,020
that.
What do you mean?

778
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,290
You just go to the gym every day at work
to be smart.

779
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,790
There's,
there's a certain amount of,

780
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,750
there's a certain amount of power over 
your mind and over your will.

781
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,760
There's a certain amount you have for 
her to have a well man,

782
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,740
whatever.
Dude,

783
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,640
listen,
I just have a will and discipline.

784
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:16,550
You get back.
Those who are dumb as shit,

785
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,480
who would just go to their construction 
job and work hard as hell every day.

786
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,940
It doesn't take no.
Listen.

787
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:27,220
Nick Diaz might not be like you.
You might not think he's socially most 

788
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,820
inept guy in the world,
but physically,

789
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:31,280
that guy's very intelligent.
Look how good as Jujitsu is.

790
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,560
Look how good he fights.
That takes the intelligence.

791
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,420
It's just,
if he's not,

792
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:38,590
you know,
focusing in other areas of his life,

793
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,880
it doesn't mean that he's not 
intelligent.

794
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,020
There's no doubt that guy when you're 
that good,

795
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,330
you're super intelligent.
It's just.

796
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,240
I mean,
I,

797
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,420
I understand where it all comes from.
I mean it's,

798
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,430
it's like it's a programming that you 
get when you're really young and you 

799
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:52,430
think that that's the way to behave and 
act,

800
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,930
but I think you've got a real good 
point.

801
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,060
You know,
you've got a real good point about the I

802
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:59,560
don't want to drive.
I like to have fun and I back wild.

803
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:01,810
I do crazy stuff,
but you are always cool to be,

804
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:03,020
but I've never seen you picking fights.

805
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,480
What's the point?
Never seen you start arguments for no 

806
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:08,480
reason.
You've always been cool to people.

807
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,950
I've never seen you bully people or fuck
with anybody,

808
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:13,310
which is where it really funny that you 
wound up getting this anti bully show,

809
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,490
listening.
The same job that I do in vow man.

810
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,510
I did the same thing all growing up.
It's so funny that I got because I 

811
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,171
played this role my entire life because 
every time there's a big kid picking out

812
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:28,840
a middle kid,
I can remember like three incidents.

813
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,220
So yeah,
I would be like,

814
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,340
because I like to fight.
I always liked to fight since I was 

815
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,161
three years old.
Like I just like my dad was in the army 

816
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:39,410
and box and stuff and he,
he like,

817
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,490
so you weren't afraid of it.
You wanted to get in there and do it and

818
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,270
talking Shit and bullying somebody guy 
boot was bullying another little kid.

819
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:52,271
I remember walking in,
seeing it going down and he was pushing 

820
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:53,180
a little kid around and I was like,
I remember I like,

821
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,190
I don't know,
I guess I was like nine or eight.

822
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,390
I walked over there and got in between 
them and then I beat this kid up,

823
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,600
but start

824
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:04,360
bullying the bullying,
bullying because bullying,

825
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,590
bullying bullies though is a very common
practice.

826
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,350
Lot righteous people do that.
I bullied,

827
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,140
bullied the other today are using blue 
torture.com.

828
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,660
My bully in high school,
he used to always fuck with me.

829
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:20,661
So what?
Fifteen years later I made a website 

830
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,941
where I used to take listerine strips 
and put them in animals mouse that I 

831
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:26,271
would photoshop like them,
have blue lips and stuff like that and 

832
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,870
pay it Peta or whatever.
It got so pissed off that they're like,

833
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:30,870
we're going to go to this person's house
and protest them.

834
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,880
So I found my bullies address and made 
this big flyer like got five new puppy's

835
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:37,950
going to give them 200 strips,

836
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,980
the on the Internet and here's.
Stop right now.

837
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,670
Stop.
Right now.

838
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,470
Don't be admitting this on the Internet.
What's wrong with you?

839
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,440
Stop what you're talking about.
No,

840
00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:51,441
it's fine.
I've already admitted at anytime on the 

841
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:51,441
artist.
Well,

842
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,501
not on this fucking podcast.
Nobody else listened to rap to didn't 

843
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:56,790
mean to do it.
The Guy,

844
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,920
Huh?
It doesn't matter.

845
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:00,520
I got the wrong address.
Okay,

846
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,970
well,
the way you never address,

847
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:05,270
you got cycle to some random person's 
house.

848
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,350
Worse.
Dude,

849
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:07,870
let's stop talking.
Stop talking.

850
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,360
Jesus Christ legality.
No.

851
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,320
Let's.
While we're on that subject,

852
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,590
tell me mayhem,
the story of your,

853
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,750
your assistant that did you wrong and 
justice,

854
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,900
which I think is 100 times worse than 
what it's not because you do.

855
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,350
You gave a waste where someone lives.
That's where someone loves his thinking,

856
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,090
I guess.
Yeah.

857
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,690
That's where someone sleeps.
This is just a phone number.

858
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,330
A phone number is not nearly as bad as 
the place where you sleep.

859
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,600
The rest of the story was.
What was weird about it is that he was 

860
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,960
arrested the same week that this 
happened for a torture to an animal.

861
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:47,961
He left his dog in his house for like 
weeks at a time while he was out doing 

862
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:50,700
other bad stuff and so it just happened 
at the same week,

863
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:53,790
which made it a million times better 
without doing other bad stuff.

864
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,930
Bad stuff.
The way he speaks as well.

865
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,490
I'm trying,
I'm trying not to get the guy in trouble

866
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:01,200
or appointed Adam.
All right,

867
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:05,370
well we could move onto subject revenge 
was served so you don't have to worry.

868
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:05,910
Okay,
good.

869
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,160
So now we can all sleep knowing that you
won't be.

870
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,460
No legally,
but it's weird because actually he was 

871
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:13,460
abusing animals.
The whole thing is funny.

872
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,540
If someone trust into a scam and gets 
busted,

873
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,460
you know,
an interesting story is the guy who,

874
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:18,180
uh,
you know,

875
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,680
people always ask,
hey,

876
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:20,750
can we take a picture?

877
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,160
Will you get me in a choke or I'll get 
you in a choke?

878
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:28,161
And I say we can't because the UFC 
specifically tells us we can't because 

879
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:28,780
two guys were sued.
Uh,

880
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,790
chuck was sued and Matt Hughes were sued
for taking pictures with Duke.

881
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,060
But then why did Jim Norton just get 
choked out the other day on opb video?

882
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,890
Video is totally different because a 
video.

883
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,280
No,
no,

884
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,320
no.
Listen to video is very obvious what's 

885
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,320
happening.
You know,

886
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,320
and by the way,
it's Jim Norton.

887
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,020
Jim Norton's not going to sue randy 
coture.

888
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:48,021
It's just random fans.
And thought they could make some money 

889
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:48,021
and they pretended that chuck heard 
them.

890
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:48,620
They pretend that Matt Hughes heard him.
Well,

891
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,760
the guy who they pretended Matt Hughes 
heard them.

892
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Apparently they investigated this 
because there's always people that said 

893
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,000
like,
come on man,

894
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,000
that's bullshit.
Matzoh.

895
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,090
Nice guy.
Who's taking a picture with you?

896
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:02,091
You asked him to do it.
This guy turned out he was a dirty cop 

897
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:02,860
and they started investigating and found
out some shit.

898
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,580
And now he's in jail doing a long 
stretch.

899
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,470
Was doing like 10 years or something.
You know why?

900
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:09,810
Because he's a Christian.
And Jesus did it.

901
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,830
Jesus.
Fuck that.

902
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,390
Do the ass.
That's what happened right there.

903
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,690
God.
Jesus came.

904
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,700
The worst thing ever sat on a podcast.
Visual it'd be a worse thing to get 

905
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,480
raped by alleging getting raped by 
Jesus.

906
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,800
Bad Shiva,
the destroyer.

907
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:23,400
That's a way better.

908
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,970
So,
uh,

909
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,490
tell us what happened with this.
This may have,

910
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,090
is,
uh,

911
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,160
like I said,
one of the nicest guys I know,

912
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,230
totally down boil dude.
But he had an issue with.

913
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,460
I had the worst assistant ever.
Like literally like I'd be like Eddie 

914
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,200
take a right on ocean and a right on 
California.

915
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:44,950
All right,
right on.

916
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,320
No Shit right on top.
Just to make a name for this guy.

917
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,520
His name is.
Um,

918
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,310
how about Mike?
Is Mike good mix?

919
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,050
My Dad's name,
title,

920
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,790
Tonya harding?
No,

921
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,860
don't say Tonya harding.
Let's just call them Tanya.

922
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,380
Call Tiny.
Tiny.

923
00:38:58,381 --> 00:39:01,650
I just take a right on ocean.
Take a right on California.

924
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,740
Got It.
And he's like,

925
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,200
oh.
And my friend goes,

926
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,650
it's a big yellow building.
So I walked to the building,

927
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:13,651
I told,
I told him to go to and I'm waiting for 

928
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:14,530
15 minutes and I'm like,
what the hell?

929
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:15,550
Finally I called the guy.
I'm like,

930
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:16,660
what are you doing?
Oh,

931
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,580
oh I,
I,

932
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,750
I,
he's just stupid established.

933
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,980
She's very poor.
It is Joe.

934
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:23,260
Okay.

935
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,960
So maybe come in with a bit.
Fucked you over.

936
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:30,961
Let's get on track.
I set it up so you know what I was 

937
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:30,961
dealing with here.
Okay.

938
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:32,920
So I'm keep giving them another chance 
every time.

939
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,500
So he can't pay my credit card.
Bill.

940
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,110
Take two minutes to do it.
He has all the information,

941
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:40,480
still couldn't do it.
He can't figure out travelocity.

942
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,540
He booked me an hour away from my family
reunion.

943
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,180
Like either he's,
he's terrible at his job.

944
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,380
Okay.
So he then goes to one of my close 

945
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:57,970
friends and just lies about everything.
Like,

946
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,440
like it's a girl.
So one of your close friends,

947
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,290
this guy found her information and 
contact high.

948
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,320
He went,
somehow he got her email on the email,

949
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,220
had to be hating.
There's only one reason why guy does 

950
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,701
that.
Guy Goes and talks to a girl to talk 

951
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:17,701
shit about,
you know.

952
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:18,280
Oh,
don't worry.

953
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:19,960
I'm well aware of that.
So,

954
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:21,070
uh,
you know,

955
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:26,071
this guy freaking calls her.
It just starts making up ridiculous 

956
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:27,880
stories.
The girl believes it.

957
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,210
She believes it.
Totally believes that event is like 

958
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:33,400
totally.
I'm like,

959
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,550
what the hell?
Where he says a bunch of bad shit.

960
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:37,000
A bunch of bad shit about me.
Yeah.

961
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,610
You're very emotional.
A hard time getting this out.

962
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,330
They are.
Yeah,

963
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,400
they are.
Yeah.

964
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,830
It's fucking sucks,
man.

965
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,730
Sensitive.
Sensitive.

966
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,430
But yeah,
fuck me over.

967
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:51,190
Finally I get the story out of her.
She tells me why I'm like,

968
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,560
what?
Like he has made all that shit up,

969
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:56,080
like really cheap.
We make up.

970
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,200
He told me he showed me all that.
I'm like,

971
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:04,470
man,
I suffered for like a week or two where 

972
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,530
she was just giving me the boot,
like no reason and I don't know why.

973
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:10,531
And you didn't know what it was and I 
didn't know what it was that all 

974
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:13,080
stabbing you in.
The guy that I fired the week before 

975
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,410
because he's inept at his job and I was 
totally cool with them too.

976
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,800
So you had already fired him and then he
fired him and then he did all that.

977
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,960
Oh,
I was confused.

978
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:25,030
I,
my body did all this while he was 

979
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,030
working.
Oh,

980
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,030
okay.
So then,

981
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,250
so you fire him,
he talks shit about you to this girl 

982
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,040
that he was probably in love with you.
And then what do you do?

983
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,600
You put.
Oh No,

984
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:34,040
I was talking to my friend Dane and

985
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,100
I totally knew I was talking to my 
friend Dane Cook while you were talking 

986
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,950
on twitter,
but twitter and of that guy's number 

987
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:48,020
that I thought I saw that I saw him.
He did that,

988
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,490
so I,
you know,

989
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:50,090
I was like,
yeah,

990
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,050
call,
call a guy.

991
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:51,950
Anyway,
I talked to him.

992
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:56,000
So you thought you were making a direct 
message to Dane Cook and you were really

993
00:41:56,001 --> 00:42:01,001
just twittering in public day.
That happens because I can't figure out 

994
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:05,670
how to delete the nice people on twitter

995
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:11,450
leaking your phone number.
So intensive because that's like 

996
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,560
something that you have so many,
like a hundred people that know your 

997
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,411
phone number and once you leak that,
like Dana white just leaked it on 

998
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:18,860
twitter the other day.
You can lose that of did with his office

999
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:20,000
number,
so they'll change is,

1000
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:20,930
oh,
that's not bad,

1001
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,610
but your cell phone,
that's pretty huge.

1002
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,820
You saw what was going on my phone.
I couldn't even turn it a number for a 

1003
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,761
long ass time.
You're going to forget how many people 

1004
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:30,761
have that number when somebody down the 
line.

1005
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,330
You're trying to reach.
It's all good.

1006
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,800
I think this is a great retreat setting.
Re just reaching,

1007
00:42:35,801 --> 00:42:35,810
going

1008
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,980
back and trying to grab a hold of people
from the past.

1009
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,650
Don't let that shit.
It's kind of fun letter.

1010
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,840
When you lose a number.
I'd like that to go.

1011
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:44,940
I liked it.
Now I can't even turn the phone on.

1012
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,990
I turned the phone on.
It just,

1013
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:50,991
it just reboots because it gets so many 
texts because I turned it on like every 

1014
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:52,440
day I want to turn it on and had like 
5,000

1015
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:56,970
tech.
So let's just reboot and I can't use it.

1016
00:42:56,971 --> 00:43:00,150
I try to make a call or I get calls in 
on it.

1017
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,550
I tried to answer the call and while I'm
answering the call,

1018
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:04,950
it's just constant buzz,
buzz,

1019
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:10,070
buzz of texts coming through buzz buzz 
or calling you out on the other line and

1020
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:15,651
then it reboots.
Is that red bad is basically turning 

1021
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:15,651
into,
onto the city on that.

1022
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,470
I'm putting in my flashlight.

1023
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,440
That's he likes to do.
But um,

1024
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,930
so unfortunately put this guy's phone 
number online,

1025
00:43:21,931 --> 00:43:23,160
but I don't think anybody's going to 
call it.

1026
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,420
Oh,
nobody will call us and Albert.

1027
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,740
Right?
Why would there.

1028
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,340
Yeah.
It's not like it's my phone.

1029
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:32,341
Oh yeah.
And it's not like you're like there's a 

1030
00:43:32,341 --> 00:43:32,341
love guy and that guy fucked you over.
You know what I'm saying?

1031
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,410
Does anybody loves the bullied me down?
Well,

1032
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,000
I am.
I am,

1033
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:36,270
uh,
an official mainland monkey.

1034
00:43:36,271 --> 00:43:41,271
I'm a member of a number for 20.
That's as Cliche as they make it folks.

1035
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:43,350
I had to take it.
It's perfect,

1036
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:43,650
right?
Yeah,

1037
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:44,190
Bro.
Come on.

1038
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,170
Somebody had to before joining mayhem as
a,

1039
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,530
a call called the mayhem monkeys.
I'm done with that shit.

1040
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:51,240
So it's easy.
You know what?

1041
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:52,430
I've got to meet him.
Monkey tee shirts.

1042
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,300
Two of them at least a general in the 
army.

1043
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,940
I mean,
at least I can't wait.

1044
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,600
Well,
you know what I'm saying?

1045
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,640
How about this?
How about I have a cold.

1046
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,690
You have a call and we'll be like 
fucking favorite nations and shit.

1047
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:11,430
But you think about it.
I just want my cold to be.

1048
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,650
People were same.
Have the same mindset.

1049
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,640
You are because we're all monkeys 
spinning around and rock in space.

1050
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:24,150
Tunnel tubes and tunnel wind tunnel.
That's where we have boys have tubes.

1051
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:27,690
Girls have tunnels for.
I love Brian.

1052
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:32,691
You know why?
Because Brian is a grown man with a 

1053
00:44:32,691 --> 00:44:32,691
beard,
but he like a 14 year old,

1054
00:44:32,691 --> 00:44:33,980
so great.
I like it.

1055
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,510
I love that personality,
man.

1056
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:41,511
That's,
that's a unique motherfucker right 

1057
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:41,511
there.

1058
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:41,511
Did you ever get your male monkeys?
Like altogether?

1059
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:43,830
Like for kind of like a roller skating 
party or anything like that?

1060
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,260
Probably.
I've done that.

1061
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:46,880
I've done that with the Rogan board 
members.

1062
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:52,300
It's almost always awesome,
but there's almost always one dude 

1063
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,260
that's creepy in real life.
One dude that just jacks the parties.

1064
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,840
Remember when we did a Houston back in 
the.

1065
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:01,190
Yeah.
Who was a good example of that where it 

1066
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,190
was a couple.

1067
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,190
Dude,
I don't remember the names,

1068
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,770
but me.
I don't know.

1069
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:02,590
Into My.
I did.

1070
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,110
I wouldn't even say it right after the 
meeting them.

1071
00:45:05,111 --> 00:45:07,480
They stopped.
They just drop off the board.

1072
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:09,020
They stopped coming to the board because
you realize this.

1073
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,380
There's been members that wives have 
found out that they came to the circle.

1074
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,930
Jerks and memory.

1075
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,560
There's been affairs.
There's been.

1076
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:18,010
Yeah,
there's,

1077
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,350
yeah.
I mean our friend outlaw,

1078
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,630
that was a legitimate friend of ours 
that died.

1079
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,840
He had a heart attack.
He was overweight.

1080
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,680
Lowboy dude,
it's a business.

1081
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,230
A cool motherfucker.
We've,

1082
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,880
we knew that guy from like 2001 was with
them when we first met.

1083
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:34,700
I'm in Houston,
right?

1084
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,870
And he was always on my message board.
Just a funny dude.

1085
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:42,871
You're so cool dude.
So you can meet cool people off the 

1086
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:42,871
Internet,
but the problem is man,

1087
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:43,900
for every cool dude,
you know,

1088
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:49,050
for every 10 cool dudes,
there's one or two just creepy fucks 

1089
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,610
that they'll show up for your 
percentages on the planet.

1090
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,930
Come on.
That's pretty fucking good.

1091
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,280
I think you know,
you,

1092
00:45:54,281 --> 00:45:59,281
you get to know people very well from 
reading the shit they ride on the 

1093
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:02,641
Internet.
That's why twitter is awesome because 

1094
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:02,641
you get to see is this person a negative
person positive,

1095
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:06,220
funny that you could see through their 
tweets because they can't help it.

1096
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,140
They put themselves out there who I 
love.

1097
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:11,960
I love black dudes that give 
motivational talk to.

1098
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,690
I like that.
You know,

1099
00:46:13,691 --> 00:46:14,960
Tyrese,
that actor,

1100
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,200
that dude is always like,
women.

1101
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,610
Stand up for yourself in all caps.
Make that man respect you,

1102
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,480
baby.
Boy,

1103
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,200
before someone else will love you.
Girls like,

1104
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:30,280
he'll like say all this like crazy,
super positive love pimp shit.

1105
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,230
No,
he's just slinging his.

1106
00:46:32,231 --> 00:46:34,320
I'm a good guy game.
You know what I mean?

1107
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:39,321
It's like I,
his fucking Avatar on twitter is a him 

1108
00:46:39,321 --> 00:46:41,550
making out with some chick.
Dude is built like a fucking creek.

1109
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,070
God who's sexy motherfucker.
I mean,

1110
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:46,990
I don't hate them.
I'm not hating but at.

1111
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:52,030
But I find it hilarious.
He's talking all this super power pro 

1112
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:56,071
God love game.
Like you could tell when someone's 

1113
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:56,071
throwing a game,
you know what I'm saying?

1114
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:58,630
You can tell when someone's real and 
that's who they are.

1115
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,860
You can't.
Yeah.

1116
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,230
But a lot of people are not as bright as
you are.

1117
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:07,231
Joe Rogan.
Isn't it fascinating when you see 

1118
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:07,231
someone's throwing a game and other 
people aren't seeing it?

1119
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:09,020
It's like scientology,
you know,

1120
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:14,030
like anything like that.
Like I had this neighbor who was a cool 

1121
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:14,030
guy.
I still love the guy and uh,

1122
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,570
where I used to live and he was talking 
to me about buying this piece of 

1123
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:18,720
property and then,
uh,

1124
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,240
I said,
well,

1125
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:24,241
I can't do it right now,
but I really want to pick this up 

1126
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:24,241
because,
uh,

1127
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,270
my wife is about to go clear.
Sorry,

1128
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,140
go.
What are you talking about?

1129
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:27,400
He goes,
yeah,

1130
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:32,401
well,
we're in scientology and she's going to 

1131
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:32,401
clear and across $50,000

1132
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:35,730
I will.
Otherwise I would pick this piece of 

1133
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:35,730
property up.
I go,

1134
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:35,730
Whoa,
Whoa,

1135
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:35,730
whoa.
I go,

1136
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:35,730
what is clear?
Like,

1137
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,530
what are you talking about?
So I'm just,

1138
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,110
you know,
as a comedian,

1139
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:40,660
automatically I want to start laughing 
at him and mocking him.

1140
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,120
But then my heckler skills are taking 
me,

1141
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,680
give them some rope.
Let's talk here.

1142
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:49,700
Let's,
let's find out what we got going on 

1143
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:49,700
here.
So I'm,

1144
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:49,700
I'm,
I'm listening to him.

1145
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,100
He's telling me that his wife is going 
to become someone who cannot be 

1146
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,010
influenced by outside forces.
I'm not fucking with you.

1147
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,100
What did,
what did they,

1148
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:03,150
they get them to the point where nothing
negative that anybody does them or 

1149
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,030
assess them.
Can Affect who they are.

1150
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,450
It's really fucking some pretty strong 
pimp shit.

1151
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:12,451
If you think about it,
you know someone tells you that they're 

1152
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:13,030
going to fix you,
so nothing's going to come in.

1153
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:17,380
What's uncomfortable about as you start 
thinking you could do that too.

1154
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:18,700
You start thinking,
I could do that to people.

1155
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:22,560
I could get start writing shit like shit
talking about easily,

1156
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,250
easily,
man.

1157
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:29,430
It was a crazy feeling though.
Knowing that I'm living next to some 

1158
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,370
dude is just getting ready.
We can go down that.

1159
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,370
You know what I mean?
Taking 50 grand from him.

1160
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,440
Man.
50 wave.

1161
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:40,441
A magic wand idea.
I'll do Goddamn Voodoo ceremony on his 

1162
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:43,750
wife so that she won't get affected by 
bad buju anymore.

1163
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,650
South Park episode without the 
scientology thing.

1164
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,410
One of the best.
Oh yeah,

1165
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:49,790
yeah.
No.

1166
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,400
When they went over the whole marriage.
Oh my God.

1167
00:48:52,401 --> 00:48:55,160
It was genius.
South parks are greatest photo history.

1168
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,660
Here's the way it is though.
Okay.

1169
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:02,080
The way it is is my friend has a grandpa
from Japan lifted Hawaii,

1170
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,380
but basically at for the last 30 years,
been in the house cleaning the house.

1171
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:09,530
She's the nicest lady.
She got one of her friends from,

1172
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,110
I dunno,
whatever old Japanese ladies do.

1173
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,380
She doesn't speak English,
so they go to a Japanese church,

1174
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,530
a Christian church,
and they go,

1175
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,240
they are telling the story of the virgin
birth and she suddenly has a freakout.

1176
00:49:23,241 --> 00:49:26,030
She's 80 years old.
She's kind of like an old lady like,

1177
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,800
you believe this.
Then you in the middle of the sermon 

1178
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,640
like you all believe this.
This is one that really.

1179
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,960
Because that's the first time in a 
Christian church.

1180
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:37,700
He didn't never.
She never heard about it.

1181
00:49:37,701 --> 00:49:39,020
Really.
She didn't know the story.

1182
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,940
Oh No,
it's not.

1183
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,530
You know,
she freaked out.

1184
00:49:42,531 --> 00:49:47,531
She was like the you guys believe it 
fucked up the whole sermon and left in 

1185
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:51,230
the middle of it.
But if you draw the parallel to the same

1186
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:53,690
thing,
it's kind of hard to.

1187
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,290
Yeah.
I mean,

1188
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:57,290
I hate to use the same thing as 
Christianity.

1189
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,320
It's just,
it's the 2000 years younger.

1190
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,690
Yeah.
It doesn't matter.

1191
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:03,610
Anybody telling you they've got all the 
answers.

1192
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,760
They don't have this weird hunger

1193
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:11,820
to to figure it all out,
but I know it's good because now we got 

1194
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,940
the scientology.
Oh,

1195
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:13,930
sorry,
science,

1196
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,200
that scientologist scientists,
real scientists,

1197
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:20,410
and I think it's messed up.
Scientologists put it in there to sound.

1198
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,060
I know,
right?

1199
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:26,070
That is kind of fun.
Kind of fun because their coat was 

1200
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:26,230
signed because people who don't want to 
go to church go,

1201
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,310
oh wait,
it

1202
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,640
sounds better,
but anyway.

1203
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:36,770
Sites in psychology together meshed up.
Exactly.

1204
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:37,910
But,
but you know,

1205
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:43,190
we all,
we all have this need to know 

1206
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,190
everything.
That's cool.

1207
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,540
These smart scientists are figuring it 
out.

1208
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:49,710
You know,
they know that the world around because 

1209
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:49,710
they shot definitely shot.
Here's the reality.

1210
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,850
Here's the reality there.
Figuring out things about matter.

1211
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,760
They're figuring out things about the 
nature of reality,

1212
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,920
but there's way more to.
The real big question isn't like,

1213
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:03,440
how does this work?
What makes this explode?

1214
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:05,360
What makes an atom?
What makes the big bang?

1215
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,990
The real question is what the fuck is 
all know?

1216
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,470
That's the real question.
That's impossible with just science.

1217
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,450
It's going to take evolution and 
science.

1218
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:20,090
They're the real thing.
That's going on is we have all this 

1219
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:20,090
incredible power right now as a human 
race,

1220
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:25,090
but we're still in this crazy adolescent
stage of figuring out how to behave and 

1221
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:28,280
think and raise children to be normal 
humans.

1222
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,210
You know,
I mean,

1223
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:34,250
it's a very strange time when you think 
about the power that people have to to 

1224
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,720
change the fucking world that we live 
in,

1225
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:40,040
like with explosions and all kinds of 
crazy shit that people have invented and

1226
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:42,920
how dumb people are as well at the same 
time.

1227
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,020
So many yummy.
Well,

1228
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:47,270
yeah,
but I mean that's the way the world is.

1229
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:52,271
You know,
there's smart people out there and at 

1230
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:52,271
those smart people,
both idiots like be around,

1231
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:57,251
but it hasn't ever been as big a 
disparity between people who are 

1232
00:51:57,251 --> 00:52:00,641
intelligent,
evolved and the people who aren't all 

1233
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:03,011
living in the same time.
There's actually a lot of the 

1234
00:52:03,011 --> 00:52:05,770
scientists,
scientists are talking about how things 

1235
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,381
are going to go in which direction are 
they going to go and they're talking 

1236
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:09,080
about the elite class of people,
the smart people.

1237
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:12,860
Some scientists say that we're going to 
evolve,

1238
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,320
evolve just like the time machine.

1239
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,740
There's going to be some goods and 
there's going to be the super smart,

1240
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,250
like crazy genetically enhanced robot 
people.

1241
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,470
I don't know why people wouldn't think 
that's possible.

1242
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,060
You know,
people want to think somehow or another,

1243
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:27,830
the human beings,
what we are right now is what?

1244
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:30,830
We're going to stay open and we're not.
We're going to become something else.

1245
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:31,850
You know,
we're gonna.

1246
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:33,110
We're gonna.
Move on to something else,

1247
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:34,490
man.
Who knows what the fuck it is,

1248
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:39,491
but it's not going to stop right here.
I just hope that I get robot arms and 

1249
00:52:39,491 --> 00:52:42,540
the people look at like other animals,
like they all bunch of different kinds 

1250
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,330
of subspecies were they branched off and
the humans themselves.

1251
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,480
We at one point in time have related to 
some other kind of primate primate that 

1252
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,450
the chimps were related to and they all 
went in different directions.

1253
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,450
Like,
who the fuck are we to assume that we're

1254
00:52:52,451 --> 00:52:53,570
going to.
That it's going to stop.

1255
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,040
The branch is going to stop here.
No,

1256
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,840
we're not.
I don't think anybody is.

1257
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,990
I think that though some piano.
What are you talking about,

1258
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:01,400
man?
Most people fake bid.

1259
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,200
We're here,
this is how we're staffed,

1260
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,350
where they can't even see that.
The Chinese chick I dated,

1261
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,060
her parents are like super short and add
ad.

1262
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:11,540
She just sprung up to like five foot 
eight,

1263
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,710
you know,
out of nowhere.

1264
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:17,770
Well guess what?
She's eating this chemically processed 

1265
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,530
food.
Then all of a sudden she gets huge and 

1266
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:20,530
she had big boobs.
I'm like,

1267
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:20,530
how?
What?

1268
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,110
Your Asian,
your mom,

1269
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:23,500
it's super flat.
Your dad is like a scrawny.

1270
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,920
Talked to a woman,
you know,

1271
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,130
having more babies

1272
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,140
now there's more twins,

1273
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,530
chemicals they pumped in or though like 
some female steroids.

1274
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:33,630
Yeah,
that was on purpose for sure.

1275
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,710
Check did embryos and it happens all the
time that people are like,

1276
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,920
they can't have a kid,
you know?

1277
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:38,760
They're like,
God,

1278
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:43,761
I just want to have a baby.
If they eject the leads with a bunch of 

1279
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:43,940
hormones,
so she's super fertile baby.

1280
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:49,190
He drops his load inside of her and all 
of a sudden you pop out a litter of 

1281
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,300
puppies and they even put embryos.
So that's what I'm saying.

1282
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:56,510
The actual embryo center,
like old women who no longer have any 

1283
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:56,510
air

1284
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,370
and their bodies and bodies are starting
to get used to having 12 kids at once 

1285
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,000
since now.
Would a body be able to have 12 kids,

1286
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,780
10 years old?

1287
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,960
Well,
I'm hoping to see the turtle woman who 

1288
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,170
like has all their kids on the beach and
then covers them up with fans.

1289
00:54:08,171 --> 00:54:11,140
I think it's a disturbing idea for 
people to think that there's going to be

1290
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:16,141
two groups of humans,
intelligent ones and more on one's 

1291
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:17,830
literally literally be two different 
species because people were worried that

1292
00:54:17,831 --> 00:54:20,650
they would be in the moron group.
That's what it is.

1293
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:22,330
Everybody's like,
I don't even want to talk about this.

1294
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:24,280
This is not real.
No bullshit.

1295
00:54:24,281 --> 00:54:25,960
People are gonna evolve together.
We're gonna.

1296
00:54:25,961 --> 00:54:27,820
Help each other.
Stop thinking like that.

1297
00:54:27,821 --> 00:54:29,980
You're a pessimist really.
Well,

1298
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,960
watch that fucking news.
Really.

1299
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:35,890
You don't pay attention to some of the 
crazy shit that you hear people do.

1300
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:41,090
You hear about people fucking their kids
and going into stores with machine guns 

1301
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,500
and you don't think that there is 
somewhere it some how possible that that

1302
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:49,501
might be a separate subspecies of people
eventually completely unrelated to like 

1303
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:53,350
a bill gates like so totally different.
It's just a matter of time,

1304
00:54:53,351 --> 00:54:53,990
man.
I,

1305
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,200
you know what I'm cool with being on the
lower end.

1306
00:54:56,201 --> 00:54:56,890
I'm like,
whatever.

1307
00:54:56,891 --> 00:55:00,220
I'll be like the smartest dumb guy.
It'll be all acts.

1308
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:01,120
Weakened.
Savage.

1309
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:01,930
I'd be like,
what?

1310
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,980
Seven slash 11.
The food.

1311
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,000
You might have a more fun and you might 
be getting more chicks.

1312
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:12,140
Smart chicks.
It's hard to get them to commit to a 

1313
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:12,140
relationship.
They're very wary of you.

1314
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:12,880
They want to like,
I don't.

1315
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,730
You seem like a guy who's gonna like 
abused my emotions,

1316
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:17,170
but the DM checks like,
yeah,

1317
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,290
hot chased.

1318
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:26,730
The dumb ones are sometimes it's more 
fun if you want a party partying with 

1319
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,271
dumb people,
sometimes there's a lot more fun 

1320
00:55:30,271 --> 00:55:30,271
partying with smart people.
Want to fucking cry.

1321
00:55:30,271 --> 00:55:31,600
Talk to you about their ex husbands and 
share with us.

1322
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:33,090
Smoke a joint and then fuck it.
Yeah.

1323
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,820
Do you.
I mean,

1324
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:40,860
think about it,
if you're just a guy trying to have a 

1325
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:40,860
good time,
you have two options.

1326
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,220
One is a girl who's 23,
just got out of college.

1327
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,860
She's out with all of her best friends 
and they're all drinking.

1328
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,910
Okay.
There's that.

1329
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,910
Or She's 31.
She's smoking cigarettes.

1330
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:51,910
She just broke up with her boyfriend.
She thinks she might be pregnant.

1331
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,140
Who the fuck are you going to talk to?
Who are you going to talk to?

1332
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,500
You want to talk to the smart check who 
just graduated from college and she's 

1333
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,500
not exactly sure what she's going to do 
with her life and like,

1334
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,170
hey,
hey,

1335
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:07,350
I just want to dance.
Can we just have a drink and have some 

1336
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:07,350
fun?
No,

1337
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,220
no.
So if you want to have some fun,

1338
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:11,320
just fun.
Studies.

1339
00:56:11,321 --> 00:56:15,520
Studies disagree with rat at age 27 to 
45.

1340
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:19,360
It's like a woman's social priority for 
sure.

1341
00:56:19,361 --> 00:56:22,810
Sexual Prime telling me a 23 year old is
not blowing you.

1342
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:23,620
Bullet

1343
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,320
were we're talking about dumb and smart.
Oh,

1344
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:31,321
that's what I'm talking about.
I'm not talking about necessarily the 

1345
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:31,321
the,
the age.

1346
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:35,100
I think the chicks are hottest when they
were in their thirties because they 

1347
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,680
became women and to know each other.
I'm just saying in our theoretical world

1348
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:40,681
of two different subspecies,
you might be better off being king of 

1349
00:56:40,681 --> 00:56:43,501
the retards because you get a lot of hot
chicks that are just like really easy 

1350
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:47,251
and fun to hang out with,
whereas opposed to hanging out with a 

1351
00:56:47,251 --> 00:56:50,401
lot of smart checks,
like they're going to want a lot of 

1352
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:52,720
commitment.
We're going to have to have a 

1353
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:52,720
relationship with the president.
We have a black president.

1354
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,510
It is the future now and I am the kick 
of the retards.

1355
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:58,240
I'm chubby enough in Texas that I'm a 
supermodel.

1356
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,860
Yeah,
in Texas.

1357
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:00,620
You fit right the fuck it.

1358
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,220
Fuck it dude.
Man.

1359
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:07,230
With a guy.
Girls like a man with a little gut in 

1360
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:07,230
Texas.
That's Amanda's living bigger's better.

1361
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:07,720
It looked in the old days,
man.

1362
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:12,721
Fat broads were attractive.
That's why those old paintings like fat 

1363
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:12,721
met yet somebody.
Yeah,

1364
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:13,630
she so luxurious.
Look,

1365
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:16,150
she gets to get fat because nobody else 
got fat man.

1366
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:21,340
You know,
when you look at those old pictures of 

1367
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:21,340
fat bitches and you're like,
why is that sexy?

1368
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,541
What the fuck was wrong with them?
What was wrong was it was hard to get 

1369
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:24,541
food that was there.
Blaine bling,

1370
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:25,050
bling and look,
oh,

1371
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,920
that's teddy.
Look at all this shit right here.

1372
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,500
I got all fat hanging off my arms and 
shit.

1373
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:32,800
That's how much food I guy match.
I don't think they talk like that.

1374
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,150
Those pictures were the.
That was the equivalent of dub magazine.

1375
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,460
That was the equivalent of MTV cribs.

1376
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,440
They were showing their bling.
This is my blank.

1377
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,710
Look on my fat.
I just be eating shit.

1378
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,990
Pigs and shit all day.
Yeah,

1379
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,720
you could be fat and fucked up and you 
look like royalty.

1380
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:52,810
Whereas everyone else was sinewy and 
they fucking worked all day.

1381
00:57:52,811 --> 00:57:55,010
They were built like mayhem.
All these facing.

1382
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,130
If I go back at time,
I'll want to plow.

1383
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,470
So hood rats that were saying,
well,

1384
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:00,880
when you go back in time,
you know,

1385
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:03,730
maybe you fat chicks,
you'd fall into a world maybe.

1386
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,640
Maybe the only reason that guys could 
get fat chicks.

1387
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:10,360
It's because they had the gay powdered 
wigs zine and it only fat chicks was the

1388
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,770
same era.
I don't know if.

1389
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,510
I'm not sure.
Whigs went a long way off with.

1390
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:20,550
I think it was get out of that when 
Jerome was painting and people to wash 

1391
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:23,410
back.
Then they washed like very rarely.

1392
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,480
Well,
you wash your armpits and your junk.

1393
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:27,190
You do like an Irish.
Our real quick,

1394
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,100
God damn.
How much did people stick back on?

1395
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,290
But I think that's how we're supposed to
be.

1396
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,870
We were always trying to kill our 
pheromones off of each other.

1397
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:40,330
Do you think that if people just walked 
around all day Funky,

1398
00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:42,640
that you get used to France?
I don't know.

1399
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:45,130
I think you might like getting used to 
the cat litter box.

1400
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:47,290
I smell it every day.
I still listen,

1401
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,610
Bro.
When you do Jujitsu,

1402
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,820
you get used to stinky smell and I don't
mind you don't mind it.

1403
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,960
I do it.
I locked up with this guy the other day 

1404
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:56,960
and as soon as we started grappling,
his shirt smelled like pneumonia.

1405
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,240
When people leave their age and their in
their in their bag and then they put it 

1406
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:03,550
on again a second time,
it's got that smell.

1407
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,460
This guy has rash guard for sure.
He wore it twice.

1408
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:10,120
That's what happened.
Some some dudes do that did a bachelor's

1409
00:59:10,121 --> 00:59:11,410
in Shit.
They don't have any laundry.

1410
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:12,910
They don't have the time to do it.
They work.

1411
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:14,760
You get used to it.
Yeah.

1412
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,260
I actually,
I did wanna like,

1413
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,130
listen bro,
I'll say that,

1414
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:23,131
but you would,
but I smell cat litter for the last 10 

1415
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:23,131
years.
That is.

1416
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:23,131
Smells

1417
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:26,920
like assholes.
Smell like to human.

1418
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,580
Listen,
I actually dangerous.

1419
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,200
It's like you have.
You have a bacteria that can give you 

1420
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:37,200
disease.
That's why it's so repulsive to you.

1421
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,920
Explain that to this guy right now.
He runs a big difference.

1422
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,770
Sorry,
I'm just saying shit is bad for you.

1423
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:47,700
Just so you know.
Rude.

1424
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,110
No,
but I like stinky people.

1425
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:55,120
I don't even know if it's negative.
You could smell the negative.

1426
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,610
However,
and every girlfriend I've had,

1427
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,680
whether she knew it or not,
I smell her armpit hard.

1428
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:02,330
Really?
Yeah.

1429
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,580
Every time I can't help it.
My nose doesn't work that good.

1430
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:07,340
Sometimes when I get warmed up it works 
just fine.

1431
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:12,370
Isn't it amazing how repulsive stinky 
pussy is not and this is not hating 

1432
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,860
statement at all.
I understand.

1433
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,010
So like no one's perfect.
It's just a health problem solving.

1434
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,340
It's a,
you know,

1435
01:00:18,341 --> 01:00:19,970
a bacterial infection or whatever it is.

1436
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,410
It's just,
it's nothing wrong.

1437
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:26,411
I mean it happens to people,
but the smell itself is such a warning 

1438
01:00:26,411 --> 01:00:27,800
sign to men.
There's whatever the fuck it is.

1439
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,320
Pussy always smells awesome.
When you get down there,

1440
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:33,530
you smell the hormones and the moistness
of it.

1441
01:00:33,531 --> 01:00:36,770
It has like this glazed fucking sent to 
it.

1442
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:39,250
Like you could just barely pick it up.
It says it.

1443
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,800
You smell a woman through her pussy.
I mean it's a clean,

1444
01:00:42,801 --> 01:00:46,820
fresh pussy is a fantastic odor,
but when it's nasty,

1445
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:49,070
when she's got some sort of a yeast 
infection or something,

1446
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:53,120
it's horrifying.
Like all your synapses are firing,

1447
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,390
all of your senses are going to get away
from that.

1448
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,530
The last thing you want to do,
I mean I will eat a girl's ass after she

1449
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:04,850
gets back from the gym way quicker than 
I would ever even think about going down

1450
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:06,120
to grow as a yeast infection.
Right now.

1451
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,510
Has anybody ever gone down to grow as a 
yeast infection?

1452
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,460
Cottage cheese is delicious,
but you know,

1453
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:11,260
it's really,
you know,

1454
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:16,270
it's bad also is so pussy where they 
don't clean out the soap enough and 

1455
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,080
you're licking your like this tastes 
like fucking wash soap powder.

1456
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:21,170
Rather be licking a dial factory event.
I would have liked.

1457
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,370
I liked it.
I liked the muffler.

1458
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:27,371
Have you ever.
Have you ever gone down on a girl and 

1459
01:01:27,371 --> 01:01:27,371
she had a yeast infection?

1460
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,460
At what level does it become a yeast 
infection?

1461
01:01:31,461 --> 01:01:33,910
I mean at one point,
if I get it there,

1462
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:35,630
event beyond it,
then it stinks,

1463
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:40,810
but I,
I'm sure that does period blood this 

1464
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:40,810
period.
Blood bug you.

1465
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:44,290
If hands on the wheel blood.
I'm now on the ground.

1466
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,220
I've reasonably been turning into 
braveheart,

1467
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:51,300
you know,
putting fucking stripes underneath my 

1468
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:51,300
eyes.
Fucking drinking that shit.

1469
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,910
I think if you're turned on enough,
you don't give a fuck for sure.

1470
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:54,800
That's what it is.
Like whenever I hear like,

1471
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,280
well girls will complain.
They will tell you stories about their,

1472
01:01:57,281 --> 01:02:02,281
you know their boyfriend won't fuck them
when they're on the rag and he's 

1473
01:02:02,281 --> 01:02:02,281
disgusted by it.
I'm like,

1474
01:02:02,281 --> 01:02:02,300
that guy's not that into you because let
me tell you.

1475
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,530
So if a guy wants to fuck you,
it doesn't carry.

1476
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:05,910
If you're pussies read,
right.

1477
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,940
That's nonsense.
What is the difference?

1478
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:08,560
If it's,
it's,

1479
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,420
it's a slippery and read or slippery and
clear.

1480
01:02:11,421 --> 01:02:13,940
I don't know if have an odor.
I don't give a fuck.

1481
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:16,820
That's blood.
If I'm horny and that's it.

1482
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:17,860
That's it.
Oh,

1483
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:22,900
this is going to be some blood part.
It's just blood dude.

1484
01:02:23,701 --> 01:02:28,701
It's like eggs and embryos.
Country Breakfast.

1485
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:32,640
My Shit is ready to go and I go into 
guerrilla mode.

1486
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:34,690
I don't give a fuck about some bull.
I don't care about it.

1487
01:02:34,691 --> 01:02:38,120
I'm going to share your faith and now.
Oh fuck yeah,

1488
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:42,300
I will.
I will eat her pussy time 20 right now.

1489
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,870
If Mrs Rogan is period.
I'll,

1490
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,020
I'll,
I'll eat that pussy.

1491
01:02:46,021 --> 01:02:47,700
I don't give a fuck.
I like it.

1492
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,230
I don't care.
I'm not scared of blood.

1493
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:54,231
Dude.
I got this Werewolf [inaudible] 

1494
01:02:54,231 --> 01:02:54,231
fixation.
Yeah.

1495
01:02:54,231 --> 01:02:57,680
I'm not afraid,
but I don't like was when I first went 

1496
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:57,680
to Washington and then you have to take 
that,

1497
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,700
that cocoon shell on your Dick the next 
morning where you can pull it off like a

1498
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:01,020
look and you forget.
Yeah.

1499
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,420
Yeah.
You can all be crusted and scaly.

1500
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,470
You gotta pick it up.
It's got its little legs still.

1501
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,440
Skin sloughs off like wow,
it's a good term man.

1502
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:21,250
Because a primal thing.
These are all like primal messages

1503
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,080
that nature gives you.
These are all good things.

1504
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:25,850
It's good for the check.
It's good for you.

1505
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
You know when you would go down on a 
check and you smell her and she smells 

1506
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,670
awesome and you want to eat her pussy.
That feels good for her too.

1507
01:03:31,671 --> 01:03:34,640
That's like extra excitement.
Like you're into it.

1508
01:03:34,641 --> 01:03:39,641
She loves it.
And is this just a burst of positive 

1509
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:39,641
energy?
That's all good stuff,

1510
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:41,150
man.
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

1511
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:46,330
You know,
and the fact that somehow or another 

1512
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,700
you,
you're not supposed to talk about this 

1513
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:47,700
or it's supposed to be something that's,
you know,

1514
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,190
discussed behind closed doors.
That's just because people are afraid.

1515
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,540
They're afraid of their feelings,
are afraid of emotions.

1516
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:52,730
They're afraid of looking ridiculous.

1517
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:53,780
Well,
that's our whole culture.

1518
01:03:53,781 --> 01:03:56,900
To have like a whole press stop on sex.
Like,

1519
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:57,950
oh my God,
sex,

1520
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,670
like,
oh,

1521
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:03,790
what do you draw on?
A lot of us is here because two people 

1522
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:04,300
fucked.
That's the.

1523
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,620
You can't talk about eating pussy on the
today show.

1524
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:11,621
Why can't I go on the today show?
And just because you don't want to see 

1525
01:04:11,621 --> 01:04:11,621
those,
uh,

1526
01:04:11,621 --> 01:04:13,640
what Katie correct.
You don't want to see that you're trying

1527
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,250
to protect you.
They're trying to protect you from gross

1528
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:21,280
women getting horny.
Katie couric 10 years ago and we got 

1529
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,700
drunk together and talking about.
I was a single man.

1530
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,650
Come on Katie.
Correct.

1531
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,740
If you want some,
if you want some,

1532
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:31,720
have you ever had some athletes,
some MMA fighter Dick?

1533
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,600
You ever have some gladiator car?
Jason Mayhem,

1534
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:37,430
Miller's ready to throw down?
Do you want to be mayhem?

1535
01:04:37,431 --> 01:04:40,620
Monkey number four to one you want to 
see available.

1536
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:45,970
You wouldn't be in the record books.
Yo our rope with a boner doing the 

1537
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:45,970
weather.
Do you want that?

1538
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:51,130
Why would Al Roker get hard?
Do you think Al roker would get hard 

1539
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:51,590
from Katie couric,
sister.

1540
01:04:51,591 --> 01:04:56,591
That gets more money,
but they hate each other telling each 

1541
01:04:56,591 --> 01:04:57,950
other in the dressing room.
You are fucking hockey.

1542
01:04:57,951 --> 01:05:00,890
How much screen time?
I bet they get shitty with each other.

1543
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:02,520
I don't like to put you through to that 
peace.

1544
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,220
Fuck you Katie.
You made $50,000,000

1545
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:06,320
this year.
You fucking whore.

1546
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,280
Probably yell at each other.
Oh,

1547
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,420
you eat the fucking weather.
What do you do?

1548
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:12,950
What do you do?
Your pointed shit.

1549
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:16,910
You think you're talented?
You mean better?

1550
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,490
I'm a conversationalist.

1551
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:23,550
You're a fucking side show.
People tune in to see how much weight 

1552
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:25,810
you lose.
Know that their managers do that.

1553
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:28,350
Not that.
Do you think they bang too massive?

1554
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:32,980
Katie couric and secrets are being 
exposed because of the Internet.

1555
01:05:32,981 --> 01:05:33,520
I mean,
look at this.

1556
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:34,990
Mel Gibson.
Oh my God.

1557
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:38,890
No.
Give George W Bush.

1558
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:45,120
Hilarious guy ever.
I love him more than I've ever loved a 

1559
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:45,120
male celebrity.
Hilarious.

1560
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,400
Because he's a.
he's a train wreck.

1561
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,940
He's a train wreck,
but everybody gets to see it.

1562
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:49,750
So he,
he,

1563
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:54,810
he,
I'm sure he must have been a fucking 

1564
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:57,301
nightmare to be in a relationship with,
but I don't think we're getting all the 

1565
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:58,840
fucking details how to her either.
I think that bitch is fucking cuckoo for

1566
01:05:58,841 --> 01:06:03,500
cocoa puffs badly because of the yellow.
The chicks always will agadoo dot.

1567
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:06,130
No,
that's why.

1568
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:08,020
Because she's already done all the work.
Now.

1569
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,300
She's collected dividends by recording 
them.

1570
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,400
Here's the deal ladies,
please.

1571
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:16,020
If anybody talks to you like that,
don't talk to them.

1572
01:06:16,021 --> 01:06:21,021
You never hang up.
Don't ever engage in because I 

1573
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:23,140
understand she's got a kid with them,
but let's be realistic.

1574
01:06:23,141 --> 01:06:24,040
This,
this shit.

1575
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,610
Yeah,
but this shit didn't start recently.

1576
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,760
Those kind of screams that 
motherfucker's been ramping up for 

1577
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:32,760
years.
Yeah.

1578
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,930
That's years worth of buildup to get to 
that point where that kind of crazy is 

1579
01:06:37,571 --> 01:06:39,100
acceptable.
You know what I mean?

1580
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,610
Like you can't release that cracking on 
the second day of the relationship.

1581
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,710
Right.
To get that kind of crazy,

1582
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:49,830
you got to get to know each other for a 
long ass time to the point where you 

1583
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:53,020
feel like you could just be completely 
insane with our fucking whore.

1584
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,240
Hope you get raped by a puck and 
niggers.

1585
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:59,650
He starts talking super crazy talk 
that's been building up.

1586
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,800
I always like a sex thing between them 
and they was like roleplaying and she 

1587
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:04,800
took the recordings of,
wow,

1588
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:09,010
that's a good conspiracy theory.
Fucking bitch.

1589
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:14,011
You and you can hold your breath going.
You know what he could say if he was 

1590
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:20,310
Jacques Queen Phoenix type dude,
he could say this is all performance 

1591
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:20,310
art.

1592
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,690
That's all he has to say.
He can say it's say to.

1593
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:29,730
He could have a public apology and say 
none of this was ever meant to get get 

1594
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:34,171
out.
And I definitely took it too far and I 

1595
01:07:34,171 --> 01:07:36,931
definitely think I got two and a 
character and said some shit that was 

1596
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:37,390
offensive and I never wanted people to 
hear it.

1597
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:42,540
And all I was doing was exploring this 
character that I was creating for a new 

1598
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:46,051
role about a guy who is very wealthy man
with a Russian bride who was trying to 

1599
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:46,810
kill him.
And he was crazy.

1600
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,760
So I was exploring this character.
I apologize.

1601
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:52,360
And she took it.
It's way out of contacts and call me.

1602
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,010
We can work this shit out,
son.

1603
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,130
Bobby.
I want to fuck mayhem and I got it.

1604
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:57,970
Dude.
We're gonna.

1605
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Meet you in Malibu.
We'll get some Sushi at Nobu.

1606
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:04,260
Holla.
Did I know Kay,

1607
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:07,650
my friend Kay works there at Nobu.
We'll get you together.

1608
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,330
Roe Mail.
We got you dude.

1609
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,230
Back twittering.
This exists.

1610
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,170
Mel.
This is all just a misunderstanding.

1611
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,840
This is a character working on.
I know mayhem knows for sure.

1612
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,850
We got you.
Didn't it though,

1613
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:24,851
as a crazy person may him.
Didn't it make you happy that someone 

1614
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:24,851
was way crazier?

1615
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:24,851
Yeah.
Like I was like,

1616
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,150
whoa.
I would never say some shit like that.

1617
01:08:27,151 --> 01:08:32,151
Like I'm like,
I get banana sandwich that I fucking 

1618
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:32,151
flipped my lid,
but I would never like.

1619
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:37,040
I don't know,
maybe it's just not in my character 

1620
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:37,040
though.
Like I don't lie,

1621
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,550
like I wouldn't say anything racist 
because I would say some crazy shit,

1622
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:40,210
but I could never make it to that level 
where,

1623
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:41,280
where you're like,
shit,

1624
01:08:41,281 --> 01:08:46,281
whore cunt.
Then again I don't have any kids so 

1625
01:08:46,281 --> 01:08:47,680
maybe it made him crazy.
Like when a dog has a baby,

1626
01:08:47,681 --> 01:08:49,880
it starts to get super protective.
Dr Drew

1627
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,170
says,
and I don't know if Dr.

1628
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:56,260
drew's right,
but Dr drew says that he thinks that 

1629
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,541
what it is is an imbalance.
He thinks that Mel Gibson is something 

1630
01:08:58,541 --> 01:08:58,541
wrong with his brain for sure.
Bipolar,

1631
01:08:58,541 --> 01:08:58,800
because if.
Yeah,

1632
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,800
if he's getting hammered all the time 
and the yelling at the cops about.

1633
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:06,820
That was the other thing Dr.
drew said he was talking about recovery 

1634
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:10,091
and the fact that mel was in recovery 
for alcohol and then he might've like 

1635
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:12,140
fucked up and fell off the wagon so he 
might legitimately be crazy.

1636
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:14,350
Sounds like it sounds like it,
right?

1637
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,690
Like,
because that's not normal guy psycho.

1638
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:19,040
He went hog up after he said his piece.
Brian,

1639
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:19,540
you ever met any?

1640
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,790
Nobody that crazy.
Yeah.

1641
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:22,800
It's usually a thyroid conditions and 
shit like that,

1642
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:26,150
but maybe he just got so stuck into the 
lethal weapon.

1643
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,200
Really.
That crazy.

1644
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,070
Huh?
You mess up.

1645
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:29,550
You who do you know?
That's that crazy.

1646
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:34,890
Uh,
I met a stripper that we don't have to 

1647
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,520
say names an x.
okay.

1648
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:38,200
No,
not just a person.

1649
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,740
Just a girl I know that I used to work 
with.

1650
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,560
Oh,
that girl got the one.

1651
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:43,840
The one with the hair.
Yes.

1652
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,710
That girl and that girl would get that 
crazy.

1653
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:47,700
Huh?
Well,

1654
01:09:47,701 --> 01:09:51,630
you could tell it was a irritation 
brought on by,

1655
01:09:51,631 --> 01:09:53,580
you know,
chemicals,

1656
01:09:53,581 --> 01:09:54,570
chemicals,
stuff,

1657
01:09:54,571 --> 01:09:59,571
you know.
And you could tell it was just one day 

1658
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,180
was awesome.
Other day it was like the worst storm.

1659
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,920
Don't have any medical issues are so 
quick to dismiss that shit.

1660
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,660
You know,
the bottom line is man,

1661
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:06,990
the,
the,

1662
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
the body fucks up and sometimes it 
doesn't produce the shit it's supposed 

1663
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,000
to produce.
Right?

1664
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Totally.

1665
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,670
Oh No.
I just think anytime somebody has a,

1666
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:19,810
you know,
whatever a mental condition at that he 

1667
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:20,570
ever had exacerbates with alcohol,
alcohol,

1668
01:10:20,571 --> 01:10:25,540
drugs or whatever it may pop up.
Step adderalls that'll make you guys who

1669
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,620
write to adderall,
apparently.

1670
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,350
Super focused and.
Right.

1671
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:33,620
I tried that and I had to flip out like 
that because the doctor said,

1672
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:34,640
oh,
you have add.

1673
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,900
Oh really?
I've add.

1674
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:38,050
I've just hyperactive.
Really Mad.

1675
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:43,060
He gave me that stuff and for awhile I 
was writing blogs on May have icon 

1676
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,860
writing whatever band out of nowhere to 
start flipping out.

1677
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:48,650
Like losing my mind.
It's like speed.

1678
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:52,580
It is speed amphetamine salts,
that's what it's called.

1679
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,590
They didn't even hide the name and a 
different name.

1680
01:10:54,591 --> 01:10:57,020
It's ketamine salt.
That's what it's called.

1681
01:10:57,021 --> 01:10:58,730
The generic.
You get generic.

1682
01:10:58,731 --> 01:11:01,340
It's methamphetamine salts.
Generic for adderall.

1683
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,510
Like,
Whoa,

1684
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:04,340
they're selling this to kids.
Brian,

1685
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:09,341
look that up because it made me crazy.
I was like,

1686
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:12,020
chemical term is.
That's insane.

1687
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:13,770
Yeah.
With Google,

1688
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,000
adderall,
adderall and uh,

1689
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:20,210
and make tactical name chicks take it 
all the time.

1690
01:11:20,211 --> 01:11:21,040
It's adderall.
I mean,

1691
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:26,190
I've been in Wikipedia,
probably chose to model chicks who take 

1692
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,080
that as a friend,
as appetite and they just walk around,

1693
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:30,780
super scrawny and ripped up.
Oh my God,

1694
01:11:30,781 --> 01:11:33,360
that's so crazy.
Do you take per day?

1695
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:38,610
Uh,
I probably take 500 milligrams sure 

1696
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:41,091
about that.
Just wondering what Brian had a weird 

1697
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:47,150
bias that better.
I have a buddy who was a comic who's on 

1698
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:47,850
the adderall and uh,
he says it helps them tremendously,

1699
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,470
right for.
Yeah.

1700
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:52,230
Well he's a dude who's,
he doesn't take care of himself.

1701
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:53,160
He,
his body,

1702
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,130
he's in his forties and he looks like 
he's falling apart.

1703
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,280
He's just one of those dudes just never 
been real health conscious.

1704
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:01,650
And,
and he was having issues with energy and

1705
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:05,280
focus and they got them on this adderall
shit in this motherfucker just works his

1706
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:05,730
ass off.

1707
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:11,150
He could just sit in front of the 
computer 10 hours at a stretch and gave 

1708
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:11,150
it to the,
to the fighter.

1709
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:15,740
The soldiers in his army help.
What do you find or what am I talking 

1710
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,430
about?
There's greenies that,

1711
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:17,790
uh,
the Vietnam era,

1712
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:20,370
the greetings,
the guys are taking it and going on ruck

1713
01:12:20,371 --> 01:12:21,970
marches for like two or three days.
Well,

1714
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:25,110
I thought the Japanese invented it.
I thought they invented it for.

1715
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:27,420
And then they tested it out on kamikaze 
pilots.

1716
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:29,940
That's what I had read.
Or maybe I had seen a documentary,

1717
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:33,230
I don't really remember totally,
but it was something on the,

1718
01:12:33,231 --> 01:12:38,231
uh,
the creation of methamphetamines and it 

1719
01:12:38,231 --> 01:12:39,951
was connected to kamikaze pilots at,
that's how they talk those guys into 

1720
01:12:39,951 --> 01:12:41,370
going crazy and slamming their plane 
into boats is that they were all men out

1721
01:12:41,371 --> 01:12:45,540
of their heads,
which totally makes sense being in war.

1722
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:46,760
He imagined being over that.
Oh,

1723
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:51,820
a batch army being in war and being left
out of your fucking mind surrounded by 

1724
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,480
other dudes.
Meth out of your fucking mind.

1725
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:55,820
And everyone's got guns.
Yeah.

1726
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:58,410
But you know what a Jap dudes are like 
real serious.

1727
01:12:58,411 --> 01:12:59,940
I lived over there.
They're like very,

1728
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:01,380
like,
focused on everything.

1729
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,340
Probably like warrior culture.
Yeah.

1730
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:05,580
Yeah.
I love it over there to me is great.

1731
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,850
I love it.
Huge Star over there too.

1732
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:12,870
You're,
you're a much bigger star in Japan than 

1733
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:15,371
you are.
And I wish that I could find over there 

1734
01:13:15,371 --> 01:13:18,231
more,
but right now they kind of fall in love 

1735
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:18,231
you over there.
You know why?

1736
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:21,640
Because I make an effort and actually my
real charter by Lee,

1737
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,490
my best buddy,
I call it my Viki,

1738
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,520
that'd be big brother and he's like my 
guy and I lived over there and I like 

1739
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,270
because of the limited Japanese I could 
speak,

1740
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:34,990
I assimilated with the Japanese fighters
and I would just be be and you know,

1741
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:39,060
18 Japanese fighters eating at a sumo 
restaurant like that.

1742
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:44,060
It would be a bunch of Japanese dude.
And I kinda got used to their culture 

1743
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:45,430
and kind of got into it like I was a 
fan.

1744
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,700
I have a Japanese dude right now.
They're so serious,

1745
01:13:47,701 --> 01:13:48,380
man.
You know,

1746
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:50,520
that's not true.
No,

1747
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,370
I don't mean I'm not joking around.
I mean about like their,

1748
01:13:53,371 --> 01:13:54,390
their,
their energy,

1749
01:13:54,391 --> 01:13:57,210
like our warrior spirit.
They're so fucking driven with it.

1750
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:59,400
You know?
It's such an interesting culture.

1751
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:02,370
The culture that like really appreciates
the effort.

1752
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,430
Like dudes will lose and get so many 
fans.

1753
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,410
You know,
dudes will just fight like,

1754
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:08,500
like a warrior.
Go out.

1755
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:12,490
She show heart in losses.
You become more and more popular.

1756
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,520
Look at Sakharova.
It didn't matter how many times he'd 

1757
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:17,520
lost.
Nobody ever gave up on him.

1758
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,860
It's like boxing,
like de la Hoya gets knocked the fuck 

1759
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:21,860
out two times in a row.

1760
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,500
Nobody was going to go see him fight.
Everyone's going to say hang it up to La

1761
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,910
Jolla,
but Sakharova dude,

1762
01:14:24,911 --> 01:14:27,250
it doesn't matter how many times he got 
his egg scramble cap.

1763
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:30,550
People showed up to watch them fight 
again and they cheered him like you were

1764
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:35,551
respected.
A bit of those like brock lesnar versus 

1765
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:38,150
where he's getting his ass kicked the 
cut back at when I love Japan just for k

1766
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:43,200
one.
I just loved that they put on k one 

1767
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:43,810
because if it wasn't for Japan,
like real high level kickboxing,

1768
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:47,080
especially in big heavyweights and shit,
there'd be nothing man.

1769
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,770
We're the fucker anybody putting on 
shows in America.

1770
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,730
I mean there are more shows and shit 
like that,

1771
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:53,200
but there's nothing televised.
You know,

1772
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:58,201
there's nothing like that.
Steve built like the UFC from their 

1773
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:03,270
negative side where no one had that 
Steve built about kickbox that anybody 

1774
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:07,390
care to like a stupid movie with high 
level guys don't man.

1775
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:12,390
It's so fucking exciting.
The PKA that PKA karate shit in the 

1776
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:15,470
eighties ruined kickboxing in America 
because everybody got the concept bad.

1777
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:20,480
Brad,
Helen and sheds flippy kicks and that's 

1778
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:20,480
like a super,
like,

1779
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,870
d level athletes do it.
Such a big difference between kickboxing

1780
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,380
above the waist and kickboxing with leg 
kicks you add those leg kicks.

1781
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,930
It changes the whole.
You've got to be way stronger.

1782
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,140
Like you have to be like a strong tough 
dude.

1783
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,840
Mentally could take it because my legs 
are sore right now for this board.

1784
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:39,880
It's trading and I only took like two 
with,

1785
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:40,530
with,
uh,

1786
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:45,740
with Shin pads on.
Did you see the shamrock fight last 

1787
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,390
weekend?
Pedro Noguera.

1788
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,750
Shamrock got smashed.
But come on,

1789
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,020
he should have.
But the,

1790
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:54,910
he finished him with a leg kick.
Final leg kick.

1791
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:57,580
He sold.
It is so hard to watch,

1792
01:15:57,581 --> 01:15:58,210
man.
You Watch,

1793
01:15:58,211 --> 01:15:59,330
you just go,
ah,

1794
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,650
because you could feel pedro with those 
tree trunk legs.

1795
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:07,860
Just the bone just slams into Ken's leg.
And if you look on camera like that for 

1796
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:07,900
years,
for years.

1797
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:12,400
So the fight randy had a rehab his legs 
for six fucking months.

1798
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:12,760
Oh,
I know.

1799
01:16:12,761 --> 01:16:17,761
He has like a weird vein.
Sticking from that fight showed is 

1800
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:18,070
random and from Pedro Huizar,
both guys from his own,

1801
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:20,800
because his old wood chop at you so 
hard,

1802
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:23,380
which such good technique and he's so 
fucking big.

1803
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:28,381
He would jack guys legs so bad.
They would literally never be the same 

1804
01:16:28,381 --> 01:16:28,381
again.
I'll tell you that.

1805
01:16:28,381 --> 01:16:29,440
You know,
you as a fighter.

1806
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:32,470
One of the rare also things that I've 
seen in my life,

1807
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:36,940
like I just remember the first time I 
kicked somebody real good in the ribs.

1808
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:42,270
I kicked him hard with my shit.
Boat was one of the most amazing 

1809
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:45,580
feelings because I never knew boy ty.
I moved to California and trade boy type

1810
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:47,560
for real and kick the pads real hard.

1811
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,870
And then I remember the guy came and he 
threw a left.

1812
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,900
He threw a jab and I turned it kicked 
at.

1813
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:56,470
When my Shin went,
like it went into his ribs.

1814
01:16:56,471 --> 01:17:01,471
I could feel everything booth right in 
there than almost unreal feeling of my 

1815
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:07,141
life because I felt his body change 
because what I was doing and I was like,

1816
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:09,070
man.
And he was.

1817
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,620
He was after that point of the fight,
he was of done like he was like,

1818
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:17,730
oh,
and then he let me beat him up high 

1819
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:20,010
because I kicked him.
I got him a good one in the ribs and he 

1820
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:20,810
was done after that.
Because you know your body,

1821
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:24,740
your body is meant to go that way.
It's a way to go.

1822
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:28,310
There's some kicks from from taekwondo 
that are really effective.

1823
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,300
The guys are using now at Connolly's,
bringing back the.

1824
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:35,550
It would piss me off because they're 
like that.

1825
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,320
You learn how to kick where you're like,
like it's a hard one,

1826
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:44,321
but it's so fast and it's not the same 
as a boy Thai kick where you digging 

1827
01:17:44,321 --> 01:17:45,240
through with the whole body and there's 
more time,

1828
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,970
fast hair,
faster.

1829
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,940
It guys will piss me off.
Just kick me across the face real quick.

1830
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,930
Guys are the guys who have the 
combination of both types of styles that

1831
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,820
have the ability to throw like 
taekwondo,

1832
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,230
fast kicks,
sidekicks,

1833
01:17:57,231 --> 01:18:02,231
and turning sockets,
but they also have the Moitai leg kicks 

1834
01:18:02,231 --> 01:18:02,231
and the more tight defense is important 
to you.

1835
01:18:02,231 --> 01:18:02,790
Know you,
you,

1836
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:05,660
you got gotta know how to fucking deal 
with those shins slamming into your arms

1837
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:07,970
because those pka guys,
they never got kicked back.

1838
01:18:07,971 --> 01:18:11,030
That very rarely did God get his arm 
broken the PKA,

1839
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:12,440
but in like,
hey juan blah,

1840
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:15,160
brandon broke his arm.
I mean frank shamrock on his arm broken.

1841
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:17,300
You have to be aware of the leg kicks 
to.

1842
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,790
So like you're like worrying about,
oh,

1843
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:22,610
this guy's going to kick me in the leg 
where you're writing pride ranch for him

1844
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:25,400
to kick your arm off at soccer.
But it's also the shin.

1845
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,290
You know,
those other guys just did not understand

1846
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:29,320
the power of the shin.
Everybody was going instead of.

1847
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:30,640
I understand the power.
Yeah,

1848
01:18:30,641 --> 01:18:35,641
but here's what that,
if you take away a boy tie guy's leg 

1849
01:18:35,641 --> 01:18:35,641
kicks,
right and make it five.

1850
01:18:35,641 --> 01:18:40,500
PK,
that style of above the waist lends 

1851
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,010
itself for like slap fights.
Yeah.

1852
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:46,060
It doesn't turn into like a real kick 
boxing match where you got another huge 

1853
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,130
element when you add knees and you just 
lead.

1854
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,050
Oh,
huge,

1855
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:48,970
huge,
huge element that,

1856
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,730
you know,
why I thought about a lot and I,

1857
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:55,770
I visualized that a lot and I always 
like in my fights I always feel that 

1858
01:18:55,770 --> 01:19:00,700
okay,
this is the end of my rage with my 

1859
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:00,700
hands.

1860
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:00,700
And I go,
I feel about what my legs.

1861
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,010
I go,
okay,

1862
01:19:01,011 --> 01:19:06,011
that's the end of my range will buy 
kicks and I figured that out the first 

1863
01:19:06,011 --> 01:19:06,320
minute or two and I go,
okay,

1864
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:08,360
that's where I could play.
Okay.

1865
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,910
So then,
you know,

1866
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:16,180
with that kickboxing big you got to 
stand so close to each other and that 

1867
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:18,170
you can't really get a good dig,
you know,

1868
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,010
you can't really get there.
There wasn't exciting back out.

1869
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:26,011
So it was like a lot of times guys 
standing like rock 'em sock 'em robots 

1870
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:26,720
just up kicking.
I mean there were some exciting fighters

1871
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:28,590
like Don the dragon.
Wilson was really exciting.

1872
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,220
It was like a little kid crew.
What's that?

1873
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,580
Dennis Alexio.
He fought a leg kick style that was.

1874
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:40,610
That was like kickstarter.
But that transition when they were 

1875
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:40,610
trying to put a leg kick fights on TV.

1876
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:43,060
I remember Don Wilson fought Alexco on 
TV.

1877
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,840
I don't remember man.
I was back in the desert sun.

1878
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,200
But Don Don the dragon.
Wilson fucked up.

1879
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:49,430
Dennis.
Alexia with leg kicks.

1880
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:50,810
That's how he won that fight.
Yeah.

1881
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:52,400
So,
but once you take that away,

1882
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:57,850
there's not a big like spot where you 
can set up to make a hard kick to the.

1883
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,910
Aren't you surprised though that someone
hasn't figured out a way to do some sort

1884
01:20:01,911 --> 01:20:03,320
of a k?
One thing in America?

1885
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,690
I know k one has had a few fights in 
America,

1886
01:20:05,691 --> 01:20:07,710
but how the fuck is that?
Not on TV.

1887
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:10,380
So like whenever that shits on like the 
k one Grand Prix,

1888
01:20:10,381 --> 01:20:14,380
I get fired up all the time.
Yeah,

1889
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,000
they put it on there.
But you know,

1890
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:20,010
it's one of those things.
Thank God for Mark Cuban and that hd net

1891
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:22,110
man,
I watch more mma because the hd net,

1892
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,700
that's a great network.

1893
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:25,800
And they're surprised that no one's got 
to kickboxing league.

1894
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:29,090
I think kickboxing,
chuck got to kickbox Shit,

1895
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,840
son.
I get a hug by Chuck Norris,

1896
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:36,140
one of the proudest moments of my life.
And I was so pissed I didn't want to go 

1897
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:36,140
back and say,
can I take a picture with you and be all

1898
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,050
cheesy,
but chuck doors,

1899
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:39,360
when he met me,
he reached out his hand and gave me this

1900
01:20:39,361 --> 01:20:41,940
big giant hug.
And he slapped me on the back.

1901
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:43,080
I'm like,
I'm in.

1902
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,480
Um,
and do you understand me?

1903
01:20:45,481 --> 01:20:48,540
I just got love from Chuck Norris.
You remember any details from that day?

1904
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:52,010
Like that certain smell or a like a 
love.

1905
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:53,570
I remember love was in the air.
No,

1906
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,830
dude,
we were at Vegas and we were at,

1907
01:20:55,831 --> 01:21:00,831
uh,
wcl one of those world kickboxing leads 

1908
01:21:00,831 --> 01:21:00,831
or whatever the name of it was.
It was vegas or Atlantic city,

1909
01:21:00,831 --> 01:21:01,620
I think it was vegas.

1910
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:02,880
I'm not sure.
Anyway,

1911
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:03,930
um,
uh,

1912
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:06,510
I just went up and I said to one of the 
guys that was working there,

1913
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:08,070
I said,
do you think I can meet Chuck Norris?

1914
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,000
And the guy goes,
yeah.

1915
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:09,960
I'm like,
fuck yeah,

1916
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:14,961
come on man,
and he just brought me over to Chuck 

1917
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:14,961
Norris and I was just going to say,
sir,

1918
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:15,120
I'm a huge fan,
very nice to meet you,

1919
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,210
and.
But Chuck Norris fucking opens his arms,

1920
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:21,420
gives me this big giant smile and says,
Joe,

1921
01:21:21,421 --> 01:21:23,280
what's going on here?
It gives me this big hug,

1922
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:28,370
and he got a hug from Chuck Norris and 
lived to tell the tale.

1923
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,860
It is.
I wish it did,

1924
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,050
dude.
I was for real man.

1925
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,110
As a kid.
I was a huge corporate chuck Norris Fan.

1926
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:39,510
Enter the dragon that fight with Bruce 
Lee.

1927
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,820
All the fucking missing in action 
movies.

1928
01:21:41,821 --> 01:21:43,020
I mean,
as dumb as they were.

1929
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:46,870
Was that Lone Wolf mcquade?
That was the shed sign.

1930
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:48,840
Come on man.
What a little David Carradine.

1931
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:52,150
Extra points.
Low multiple to chuck.

1932
01:21:52,151 --> 01:21:57,151
Norris was the fucking man.
So for me to have Chuck Norris will 

1933
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:58,170
recognize me and give me this big hug 
and call me by name.

1934
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,790
I was like,
Oh shit.

1935
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:01,620
It's like the best birthday present 
ever.

1936
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,210
Morpheus a lot.
No,

1937
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,560
no.
We don't want to do audio.

1938
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:12,340
That would be fine.
I don't want to talk about that stocker 

1939
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,310
character.
I don't want to give him fuel.

1940
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:18,720
You know what I'm saying?
See baby shaking that ass shaking your.

1941
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:20,370
Your dog's given up on trying to kill 
it.

1942
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:24,040
He wants to kick it.
He was a.

1943
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,340
He was ready to fucking engaged.
Yo.

1944
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,560
He hates squirrels.
Birds and cats.

1945
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,040
Like he will fuck some shit up if,
if,

1946
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:34,480
if he could get a hold of it.
I've seen it brought into this,

1947
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:37,010
into a busier on Fairfax and La Brea.

1948
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,500
Fairfax said third.
He ran out into the street after a bird 

1949
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:42,500
wouldn't.
Let me ask you this.

1950
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,510
What do you think about strikeforce?
You like working for them?

1951
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,260
Yeah,
so of course everyone's cool.

1952
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:48,180
Yeah.
You know,

1953
01:22:48,181 --> 01:22:49,000
I,
I feel like they,

1954
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:53,940
they just have certain problems that 
will be fixed as time goes on.

1955
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:58,140
But if it wasn't for this battle with 
the Diaz brothers,

1956
01:22:58,141 --> 01:23:03,141
this,
this thing in post fight thing with 

1957
01:23:03,141 --> 01:23:03,141
Gilbert Melendez,
anything.

1958
01:23:03,141 --> 01:23:03,141
Do you think you would be challenging 
for the title right now?

1959
01:23:03,141 --> 01:23:07,420
Because Jake just abandoned it.
Toughest fight with them.

1960
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:10,090
Your fight with him was way tougher than
Henderson's fight.

1961
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:16,100
I guess I guess I shouldn't say that 
that's not really fair because Dan came 

1962
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:19,831
really close to putting them out.
The first one he came closer to jake is 

1963
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,970
such a damn good fighter.
He like,

1964
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,530
he left us.
He went,

1965
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:23,950
fuck it.

1966
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:28,950
I'm just going to keep going.
But from that point on it was a route j 

1967
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:29,020
dilla clothes.
I was like,

1968
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:30,870
it seemed like Dan was having a hard 
time making weight.

1969
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,740
It didn't seem like the normal Dan think
you worked for him and he looked,

1970
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,070
he looked.
I kinda run down like,

1971
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:44,190
dude,
I think him making 85 might disagree 

1972
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:44,190
with you and I know this because I try 
really.

1973
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:48,840
He like walks around like one 97,
but he doesn't like cutting that weight 

1974
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,530
man.
Well of course [inaudible] duties,

1975
01:23:50,531 --> 01:23:52,260
fucking 40 years old.
He does that,

1976
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:57,270
but that's what I'm saying.
I'm saying that at that age I'll get 

1977
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:57,270
over it.
I'm sure you get over it.

1978
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:58,580
You know he's a big gut weights weights 
excuse what?

1979
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:00,760
Like what are you doing?
Nothing.

1980
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:04,360
He like eight years.
I know,

1981
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:06,630
but when it gets to be 40,
that's really hard to do.

1982
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:07,300
Yeah,
for sure.

1983
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:12,310
Dan,
if he catches you with that fucking 

1984
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,310
righthand damn,
you got problem.

1985
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:14,140
We all know that dude's got one missile 
man.

1986
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:16,990
He knocked out vanderbilt.
Vandelay was left.

1987
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:22,010
Oh,
he thought got a strong core and we 

1988
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,010
twists.
Oh yeah.

1989
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,010
It's super hard punch.
Yeah,

1990
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:23,340
you got fucking problems.
Know.

1991
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,180
I mean he's not like a,
you know,

1992
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:28,320
a Masato technique striker,
but God damn,

1993
01:24:28,321 --> 01:24:29,940
he's got Haymakers,
you know?

1994
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:32,040
Yeah.
Maybe I kind of gave strikeforce a black

1995
01:24:32,041 --> 01:24:32,710
guy.
You know,

1996
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:37,711
I brought some attention to us,
but I gave strikeforce a black eye a 

1997
01:24:37,711 --> 01:24:38,740
little bit by buying cars of that whole 
drama,

1998
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,840
but it didn't cause it.
You didn't want to start.

1999
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:45,910
I want to start a fight.
Of course I want to go in there wanting 

2000
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:46,180
to hype up a rematch and everybody's on 
CBS.

2001
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,090
Let's make some money.
Let's,

2002
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:52,410
let's get everybody fired up and 
enthusiastic about this and everybody 

2003
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:52,410
wins.

2004
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:55,950
It's not like you were going in there 
with an angry mean face on now what it 

2005
01:24:55,961 --> 01:24:57,580
was was it?
It's like,

2006
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:59,380
I dunno,
the CBS not get it,

2007
01:24:59,381 --> 01:25:01,180
you know,
everybody was bad at me and I'm like,

2008
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,830
guys,
what happened?

2009
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:05,350
Negative here I,
I got jumped on.

2010
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,630
I didn't get hurt.
They,

2011
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:11,740
these guys totally did not understand 
why you were getting all the blame for 

2012
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,371
that.
I know the people who should have got 

2013
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:14,371
the blame with the people who let you 
in.

2014
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:14,830
No one should have let you in.
That was an oversight.

2015
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,870
They know that now it'll never happen 
again.

2016
01:25:16,871 --> 01:25:18,940
That's what you know,
running a business is all about.

2017
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:21,280
No one's perfect.
But once that said,

2018
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:25,030
you know what it was was there was too 
many fucking people in the octagon.

2019
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:30,210
There was you who was an unwanted person
in the octagon and you were into 

2020
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:32,120
interfering with someone who is getting 
their glory days.

2021
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,870
The whole thing was just badly run.
It was chaos.

2022
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,670
You get a bunch of fucking dogs 
together,

2023
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:39,250
okay.
At darkstar ground and shit happens.

2024
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,910
You can't get mad at the dogs.
You know,

2025
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,960
you just can't look.
I think those guys shouldn't have done 

2026
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:45,960
that,
but fuck man.

2027
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,260
You know,
emotions run high after victories.

2028
01:25:47,261 --> 01:25:49,120
Things happen.
People get crazy and I,

2029
01:25:49,121 --> 01:25:50,560
you know,
and what's the worst that happened?

2030
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,340
May have got jumped on TV.
You got fucking kicked in the head while

2031
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:57,640
you were on the ground.
I got fined for it and it's suspended.

2032
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:02,670
I'm like,
how long they suspend you for three 

2033
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:02,670
months.
Three months.

2034
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:04,000
But if I would have argued with it,
it would have been like dive

2035
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,290
bar.
You can't win because win.

2036
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,730
If you win,
it sets a precedent.

2037
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,200
I know.
When is the last time anybody ever tried

2038
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:14,960
to get a fight overturned or protested 
something ever and it came through.

2039
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:18,050
So any steroid tasks,
anything.

2040
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:22,790
A protest is a stoppage or something and
it worked.

2041
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:25,470
No,
it didn't know nobody.

2042
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:29,230
Benji radic protested.
The Scott fire resident wasn't.

2043
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,570
Yeah,
I think it was.

2044
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:32,810
You thought it was stopped too soon.
You know what man,

2045
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:37,040
that people fuck up and it's a terrible 
thing that people fuck up,

2046
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:42,041
but once they fuck up,
it's very rare that anyone can look 

2047
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:43,610
straight into the future with a positive
mindset have usually works out for me.

2048
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:45,800
So who do they have lined up for you in 
October?

2049
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,840
I'm not sure.
I bet we're trying to put Nick Diaz 

2050
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:50,840
together.
Oh goodness.

2051
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:51,800
A little grudge match.
So,

2052
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:52,610
so guess what?

2053
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:56,690
I started grudge bag and it ended up 
that way they're going to use it,

2054
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,560
you know what I mean?
Like,

2055
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,180
okay,
now we've got a grudge match.

2056
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:03,950
Well that would be a hyped up fight.
So that will be an October.

2057
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,540
Do you know where it's going to be at?
Nope.

2058
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:06,530
No,
I don't know anything.

2059
01:27:06,531 --> 01:27:08,260
I don't know if it's happened yet,
but you know,

2060
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,820
I like to run my mouth off and hopefully
make it happen.

2061
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,430
Are you bummed out that you don't fight 
for the UFC?

2062
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:15,870
No.
No you're fine with it.

2063
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,860
You know,
I got a good deal at whatever.

2064
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:18,610
Cool.
Yeah.

2065
01:27:18,611 --> 01:27:20,210
The UFC,
the biggest show in town and,

2066
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:22,870
and I understand that like when you see 
like,

2067
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:25,640
you know like Charleston and challenging
Anderson for the title,

2068
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:27,280
do you look at that shit and so it got 
damage.

2069
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,280
That could be my wish.

2070
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,050
Yeah.
I wish I could fight Anderson.

2071
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,680
It's like one of those things I like 
right now at this stage of my career.

2072
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:34,480
Cool.
If,

2073
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:39,540
if,
if something gets worked out where I 

2074
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:39,540
could work with that with the future.
Okay,

2075
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:40,970
cool.
But you know right now I have a contract

2076
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:44,060
and you know,
I'm generally pretty happy and you know,

2077
01:27:44,061 --> 01:27:45,990
whatever.
How cool you with Dana,

2078
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:46,820
you and Dana.
Cool.

2079
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I don't know.
I don't know that she doesn't say hi to 

2080
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:52,000
me.
So I'm like,

2081
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,170
oh well damn.
They didn't say it me,

2082
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,370
but I don't know because you think he's 
crazy,

2083
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:56,520
man.
Crazy.

2084
01:27:56,650 --> 01:28:00,170
I'm crazy and I don't blame them because
you are crazy.

2085
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:01,090
I'm crazy.
But,

2086
01:28:01,091 --> 01:28:02,870
but not the pretty controlled.
And if you,

2087
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:05,180
if I can get on the same page as 
somebody,

2088
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:10,320
we can be crazy.
I'll be the crazy guy and you make some 

2089
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:10,320
money.

2090
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,560
We'll both make buddy.
How long do you think bully beat downs 

2091
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:14,560
going on,
man,

2092
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,130
the way too long.
I think I'll be old.

2093
01:28:16,131 --> 01:28:17,240
Pan for Ellis.
Yeah,

2094
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:18,890
dude,
it's juggernaut.

2095
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:19,730
God,
I,

2096
01:28:19,731 --> 01:28:22,130
I thought it wasn't.
And then I did the third season.

2097
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:26,630
I recorded it all and it'll be released.
And how crazy it would be if you were on

2098
01:28:26,631 --> 01:28:31,631
bullied,
beat down and you're the ultimate 

2099
01:28:31,631 --> 01:28:31,631
fighter.
Same time,

2100
01:28:31,631 --> 01:28:35,150
Bro.
I already know two bites tv time as the 

2101
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:35,150
guy as it is right now.
You can't take it.

2102
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:37,000
No like it.
Fine.

2103
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:38,900
I don't mind,
but what I'm saying is I don't know.

2104
01:28:38,901 --> 01:28:42,080
People get sick or bay.
No one's gonna.

2105
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:43,090
Get sick of you.
May Have.

2106
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:45,500
Don't worry about that fellow.
We're here for you.

2107
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,180
All right.
Just take a little bit less.

2108
01:28:47,181 --> 01:28:48,740
Be 12.
No Man.

2109
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:51,830
What is it about the veto gives you 
energy too much.

2110
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:55,070
Be 12.
Dating this girl.

2111
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,810
Nice in fucking freaks me out,
man.

2112
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,290
Daddy burn your whole body,
your whole body.

2113
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,100
You know what got used to it now

2114
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,050
and I like you.
I like,

2115
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:05,430
oh,
like it's burning my whole body,

2116
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:06,930
but I like it.
I dated a girl,

2117
01:29:06,931 --> 01:29:09,180
got me all the vitamins and whatnot at 
Man.

2118
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:10,860
I'm like,
this was the best thing that happened to

2119
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:12,060
me.
That's very important.

2120
01:29:12,061 --> 01:29:13,290
Men Supplements.
It's amazing.

2121
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:15,450
Nobody ever it.
You know what?

2122
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:18,780
I just started taking supplements like 
this year I've never took supplements.

2123
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:19,800
I would just be like,
whatever.

2124
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,120
Wow,
that's crazy.

2125
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:22,530
It's stupid,
but what it is,

2126
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:26,910
because I didn't think that it was that 
important but bad.

2127
01:29:26,911 --> 01:29:28,980
I feel as a market difference.
Well,

2128
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:29,880
the,
you know what it is,

2129
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:32,640
it's marketed,
it's marked marketed.

2130
01:29:32,641 --> 01:29:33,510
Rather if you,
uh,

2131
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,800
you know,
listen to people,

2132
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,550
like doctors should tell you all you 
need is a multivitamin.

2133
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:42,560
All that stuff is nonsense.
So you know why it's because it's not 

2134
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:42,560
FDA approved.
Oh,

2135
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,110
it's not approved.
Well,

2136
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:45,600
it doesn't mean just because it's not 
approved doesn't mean it doesn't work.

2137
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:50,850
Or there's a lot of anecdotal evidence 
from people that are taken in that are 

2138
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,020
having pretty positive results.
There's like nootropics that I take that

2139
01:29:52,021 --> 01:29:54,270
make your brain work better.
There's a whole bunch of.

2140
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,040
Now give me some of that.
Yeah,

2141
01:29:56,041 --> 01:30:01,041
I've got some.
I'll write you down a list of all the 

2142
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:03,501
different sharing what it is,
but there's a bunch of different things 

2143
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:08,571
that are designed.
A Jew nootropics designed just to 

2144
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:09,030
increase cerebral activity.
You know,

2145
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:14,031
you're talking about that.
And I think that we live in a culture 

2146
01:30:14,031 --> 01:30:15,390
where it's not about living better 
really.

2147
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:20,220
It's about just living above the death 
line like nobody wants to.

2148
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:22,610
Nobody wants to.
Nobody wants to be famous.

2149
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,540
Nobody wants to reframe.
Fantastic.

2150
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:25,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

2151
01:30:25,381 --> 01:30:26,100
It's like,
you know,

2152
01:30:26,101 --> 01:30:26,970
I,
I had a conversation.

2153
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,490
Don't feel fantastic,
is bad and wrong.

2154
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,160
That's why you're not allowed to smoke 
pot and anywhere,

2155
01:30:32,161 --> 01:30:32,850
but California.

2156
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:33,380
Well,
there's that.

2157
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:34,830
You know,
how about men?

2158
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:37,890
How much does it drive you crazy when 
dudes who don't work out,

2159
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:42,891
we'll talk shit on,
on exercise and the importance of 

2160
01:30:42,891 --> 01:30:45,561
keeping your body healthy.
Conversation view where a lot of people 

2161
01:30:45,781 --> 01:30:48,480
are ignorant and then they take pride in
their ignorance.

2162
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,630
When your body works better,
your brain feels better.

2163
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:53,940
It all works better.
The whole thing flows better.

2164
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:58,970
So to zoom in,
but nobody wants to admit that that's 

2165
01:30:58,970 --> 01:30:58,970
their issue.
You know,

2166
01:30:58,970 --> 01:31:01,440
nobody wants to admit that their,
their lack of exercise and everything.

2167
01:31:01,441 --> 01:31:01,700
No,
no,

2168
01:31:01,701 --> 01:31:01,980
no,
no.

2169
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:04,400
I don't need.
Nobody needs to work out to.

2170
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:09,860
Comics are fucking famous of right.
Comics are always bitching and whining 

2171
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:13,700
and they just want to sleep til three 
and don't do anything constantly that,

2172
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:15,270
that should have so important for you,
man.

2173
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:20,580
Oh,
well I just think that people in 

2174
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,981
general,
it's easier to be lazy and that bit's 

2175
01:31:21,981 --> 01:31:21,981
about it because that's funny.

2176
01:31:21,981 --> 01:31:24,360
Did you get positive reinforcement from 
people laughing at that?

2177
01:31:24,361 --> 01:31:25,140
Like,
Oh yeah,

2178
01:31:25,141 --> 01:31:27,330
I hear you work it out to A.
Yeah,

2179
01:31:27,331 --> 01:31:29,640
there's a little bit of that misery 
loves company,

2180
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:34,700
you know,
but I had a conversation with the dude 

2181
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:34,700
once we was talking about like,
what's the point and exercise and what's

2182
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:34,710
the point working out?
I go,

2183
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:37,410
all right,
if I could give you a pill and this pill

2184
01:31:37,411 --> 01:31:40,530
would give you a super powerful body,
like ridiculous,

2185
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:42,300
much more powerful.
The normal person,

2186
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:45,240
you could literally take the normal man 
and strangle him at will.

2187
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:49,320
You can take him manhandle him,
treat him like a girl and and choke them

2188
01:31:49,321 --> 01:31:54,321
to death.
If I give you a pill that would give 

2189
01:31:54,321 --> 01:31:54,321
you,
that wouldn't.

2190
01:31:54,321 --> 01:31:54,540
What do you take it when you want to 
have that power?

2191
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:55,970
I mean,
when you want to have this superpower,

2192
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,890
I'll give you a pill and it turns you 
into a lesson and I'm like,

2193
01:31:58,891 --> 01:32:00,670
well,
you can have that stupid I have to do is

2194
01:32:00,671 --> 01:32:01,120
work out.

2195
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:03,800
If you train and you do some 
kettlebells,

2196
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:09,070
gay related agenda to working as a 
salesman at 24 hour fitness legends,

2197
01:32:12,951 --> 01:32:16,700
legends in Hollywood got me,
got me under the Tenth Planet Jujitsu,

2198
01:32:16,701 --> 01:32:19,010
a affiliation program.
I'm trying to sign people up.

2199
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:21,720
You enjoy working out though where a lot
of people

2200
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:23,530
don't enjoy it.
You know what I enjoy?

2201
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,270
I enjoy Jujitsu.
Jujitsu.

2202
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:27,610
To me,
it's like it's an awesome distraction.

2203
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:32,611
I got so much going on in my life when I
get into Jujitsu and I'm rolling some 

2204
01:32:32,611 --> 01:32:33,370
dude and we are just trying to kill each
other.

2205
01:32:33,371 --> 01:32:34,570
You know,
I'm trying to choke him.

2206
01:32:34,571 --> 01:32:36,400
He's trying to choke me.
We are battling.

2207
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:39,260
We're pacing ourselves.
I know what this motherfuckers doing.

2208
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:41,740
He keeps going for the deep half sweep.
I gotta keep that under hook.

2209
01:32:41,741 --> 01:32:46,741
I got to stop them.
There's like this battle going on and 

2210
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:46,741
when that battle is going on,
man,

2211
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:50,281
I don't think about shit else.
I'm not thinking about I need to clean 

2212
01:32:50,281 --> 01:32:50,281
my office.
I'm not thinking about.

2213
01:32:50,281 --> 01:32:51,970
I need to call that dude about this 
thing.

2214
01:32:51,971 --> 01:32:54,490
I need to get my shit together and write
this new material.

2215
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:55,220
No,
I'm,

2216
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:56,980
I'm,
I'm just doing Jujitsu.

2217
01:32:57,130 --> 01:33:00,040
I'm in that zone because it's so 
difficult to do.

2218
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,570
It puts you in the zone,
you know,

2219
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:04,420
and it's like a fun fucking game there.
Weber on it.

2220
01:33:04,421 --> 01:33:06,040
You need to clean your office a little 
bit,

2221
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:06,210
right?

2222
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:11,730
Yeah.
If you only had the passion with 

2223
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:13,261
cleaning windex,
that's a new shell.

2224
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:21,440
And with the fucking agro cleaning guy,
you're telling me that Mr Leeds not on 

2225
01:33:22,391 --> 01:33:23,290
juice.
Look at that guy.

2226
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:27,130
He lost all his hair and Jack,
he looks like he does.

2227
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:29,010
He does,
but no tattoo.

2228
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:34,890
Swollen Shit.
Christoph is a fucking sculpted 

2229
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:34,890
specimen.
Kids,

2230
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:37,270
right?
Like bad damn specimen.

2231
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:38,020
Cool.
Cool.

2232
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:41,140
Motherfucker to him in his girl hung out
with them in England.

2233
01:33:41,141 --> 01:33:46,141
Cool Shit.
And Krista was on the ultimate fighter 

2234
01:33:46,141 --> 01:33:46,141
for people who don't know.
Super Nice Guy.

2235
01:33:46,141 --> 01:33:50,790
That's the thing about mma that people 
don't realize is how many nice people 

2236
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:51,490
there are that are involved in it.
And in martial arts in general,

2237
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:56,640
like some of the nicest people I know 
are dudes that have fought and dudes 

2238
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,230
that train because you have like a 
better control your ego.

2239
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:00,250
You're like,
you know,

2240
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:01,870
you just,
you're used to getting your ass kicked.

2241
01:34:01,871 --> 01:34:05,080
He used to,
used to finding out your real boundaries

2242
01:34:05,081 --> 01:34:06,760
by,
by breaking yourself down,

2243
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,770
you know,
by getting to the point where you know,

2244
01:34:08,771 --> 01:34:09,400
you,
you,

2245
01:34:09,401 --> 01:34:12,340
you literally can't fucking breathe.
You literally are in class.

2246
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:15,880
And when the everyone says time and you,
you drop to your back,

2247
01:34:15,881 --> 01:34:16,720
you know,
you literally,

2248
01:34:16,721 --> 01:34:17,470
you're broken.

2249
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,140
Whereas other people did.
They hardly ever experienced that.

2250
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:23,890
They don't experience the boundaries of 
their,

2251
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:26,470
of their drive,
the boundaries of their discipline.

2252
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:31,680
You know?
So like the people that I've met that 

2253
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,451
are like fighters,
like some of the coolest fucking people 

2254
01:34:33,451 --> 01:34:33,451
you ever meet in your life,
you know,

2255
01:34:33,451 --> 01:34:34,240
they have to show their ass the world,
man,

2256
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,600
it's definitely a,
you gotta drop your got to whoever you 

2257
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,351
are cubs out.
If you have to really be yourself for 

2258
01:34:43,351 --> 01:34:44,920
things and you have to deal with the 
pain and you're like,

2259
01:34:44,921 --> 01:34:48,430
oh my God,
I don't want to be a pitch and dad,

2260
01:34:48,431 --> 01:34:51,250
you never loved me and shit like that 
goes through your head,

2261
01:34:51,251 --> 01:34:52,750
you know,
like it's not,

2262
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:53,280
you know,
you,

2263
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:56,500
you have to confront these real fears 
and real.

2264
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:57,860
You have to confront everything.

2265
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:03,040
And I,
I say all of you guys out there in 

2266
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:03,040
cyberspace is be a cage fighter just for
a day.

2267
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,000
And there's,
there's growth in that.

2268
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:07,630
There's growth in that confrontation.
You know,

2269
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,590
when you understand your boundaries and 
you hit them,

2270
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,170
you know,
you,

2271
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:12,860
you get to know yourself better.
You get to know yourself better than the

2272
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:15,650
average dude who doesn't do shit with 
his body.

2273
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:20,830
You know,
there's something about doing something 

2274
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:20,830
really difficult willpower wise with 
your body,

2275
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:23,390
like training,
especially training in Jujitsu and shit.

2276
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:23,780
Well,
like there's,

2277
01:35:23,781 --> 01:35:26,060
there's battles man.
Or sometimes you know,

2278
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:29,030
you guys got your back and you're 
defending and you know,

2279
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:31,040
you could just tap out and this is going
to be over,

2280
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:32,270
but your,
your other side.

2281
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:33,770
Ha.
You know the other side of your brain is

2282
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:34,190
going,
no,

2283
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:36,830
we're going to cut this out as long as 
we possibly can.

2284
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:40,340
And there's that like fence that you're,
you're dancing on where you're like,

2285
01:35:40,341 --> 01:35:42,190
I only just tap right here,
fuck this cake.

2286
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,630
But it's so uncomfortable and so 
difficult to get through,

2287
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:49,780
but your willpower allows you to survive
and then you get through and you're 

2288
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:49,780
like,
motherfucker,

2289
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:50,120
I got through that.
I thought I was gone.

2290
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,280
I thought I was gone and now I'm on top.
Oh Shit.

2291
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:53,600
And now I'm passing.
You know,

2292
01:35:53,601 --> 01:35:57,830
it's like this overcoming adversity.
A lot of people never experienced that.

2293
01:35:57,831 --> 01:36:02,831
Especially if like physically where your
mind has to control your body through 

2294
01:36:02,831 --> 01:36:03,290
some uncomfort,
you know?

2295
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,290
Yeah,
yeah,

2296
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:09,291
I know.
I guess you could get the same effect 

2297
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:09,291
for like,
I don't know,

2298
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:11,850
run a marathon or do you know physically
where you have to push your body,

2299
01:36:11,851 --> 01:36:14,820
the mind and the willpower have to 
control the body.

2300
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:19,970
I think it's much more difficult when 
you're doing it in a competition like 

2301
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:22,611
mma or anything like boxing or Jujitsu.
Anything where it's a dude is trying to 

2302
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:24,240
kill you,
then it's much more difficult.

2303
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,460
Definitely.
But shit man,

2304
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:30,010
think about the kind of willpower that's
involved in the Tour de France now.

2305
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,880
Unbelievable.
Those guys are just peddling,

2306
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,010
pumping the legs,
just doing the same movement.

2307
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,440
Discipline,
man.

2308
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:38,760
Tim,
when I look at like Lance Armstrong,

2309
01:36:38,761 --> 01:36:40,740
I go,
that must be the most boring,

2310
01:36:40,741 --> 01:36:45,741
intense motherfucker alive.
Does some boring ass shit is just 

2311
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:47,760
peddling semi.
It's not boring.

2312
01:36:47,761 --> 01:36:51,290
I mean obviously the racing and it's 
awesome countryside and shit and there's

2313
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:56,420
all this attention and all this energy,
but they're doing the same thing for 

2314
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:56,420
days.

2315
01:36:56,420 --> 01:37:00,890
That shit takes days.
It's like who's the most boring and 

2316
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:00,890
test?
Motherfucker on earth.

2317
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:01,170
Let's find out.
Everybody get together,

2318
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:03,510
get on a bike.
What's the favor?

2319
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:06,620
Like a county or something.
Fucking accounting Olympic.

2320
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:10,830
The guys just adding fucking bills up 
for fucking six days straight.

2321
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:15,950
Yeah.
There's something about that like sheer 

2322
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:17,601
tests of discipline that are so 
uncomfortable for me because as a 

2323
01:37:17,731 --> 01:37:19,530
fighter I have like,
you know,

2324
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:24,180
serious discipline to get inside the 
room at fight with other guys for,

2325
01:37:24,181 --> 01:37:25,440
you know,
at least an hour.

2326
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:30,470
Like I'm doing that for at least an hour
a day and pretty much my entire life 

2327
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:31,440
I've done that.
The other side,

2328
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:34,890
I can't fill out a form without getting 
distracted.

2329
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:37,290
Like I bike fitting there.
How's the application?

2330
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:39,930
Was the funniest thing I've ever done 
because I'm sitting there like,

2331
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:42,630
motherfucker,
if you put one more paper by faith,

2332
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:45,010
I'm going to slap your fucking notary 
public faith.

2333
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:48,690
I like God.
It's like all day just sitting there.

2334
01:37:48,691 --> 01:37:49,980
I hate.
I hated it.

2335
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:51,060
That's funny.
Yeah,

2336
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:54,210
there's a different.
It's different because I'm,

2337
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:56,220
I'm,
I'm very like when I look at a lawyer

2338
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:56,940
or whatever,
I'm like,

2339
01:37:56,941 --> 01:38:01,941
wow,
you fucking look at papers that read 

2340
01:38:01,941 --> 01:38:01,941
shit all day.
Like,

2341
01:38:01,941 --> 01:38:02,640
dude,
I am the exact same way.

2342
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:07,700
I'm a retard when it comes to filling 
out forms and shit and I get onto page 

2343
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:07,830
10.
I feel like someone's hitting me.

2344
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,080
Someone's,
someone's drowning me like,

2345
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,510
stop,
this is boring,

2346
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:16,510
and I think what it is is like you don't
want to see,

2347
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:21,560
you don't want to put your brain on that
low and rpm where you're reading this 

2348
01:38:21,631 --> 01:38:26,631
and reading that book,
making sure this is okay and make sure 

2349
01:38:26,631 --> 01:38:30,081
that's okay.
And tell that to every teacher that I 

2350
01:38:30,081 --> 01:38:30,300
have worked with,
square pegs in round holes,

2351
01:38:30,301 --> 01:38:31,350
man,
that's what it is.

2352
01:38:31,351 --> 01:38:33,480
You know the,
the big fucking problem with teachers is

2353
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:38,481
they're trying to turn everybody into a 
robot that assumes a job out there in 

2354
01:38:38,481 --> 01:38:42,651
the world and there's people with unique
personalities that could be artists and 

2355
01:38:42,651 --> 01:38:42,651
no one recognized that.

2356
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,960
Whether it's a martial artist or a 
singer or a comedian,

2357
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:50,100
no one looks at that as a viable path 
for a job.

2358
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:52,140
You know?
So teachers want you to be able to get a

2359
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:54,560
job they want you to do to do,
you know,

2360
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:57,530
what it takes to get a job at some 
company and,

2361
01:38:57,531 --> 01:38:58,440
and,
and move on.

2362
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:01,920
But let's be honest,
I both people that you have to do,

2363
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:06,960
you can't cater.
You can't cater most schoolwork to 

2364
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:11,631
anyone who's an artist,
but there should be some way to 

2365
01:39:11,631 --> 01:39:13,941
recognize when someone's unusual.
There should be some way to recognize 

2366
01:39:13,941 --> 01:39:17,090
and part of is that the kids don't have 
any discipline and that's why they're 

2367
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:19,281
fucking going squirrely and that's why 
they can't read and probably their home 

2368
01:39:19,281 --> 01:39:19,281
life,
but you're not going to fix that.

2369
01:39:19,281 --> 01:39:21,510
Okay.
You could try to square out that fucking

2370
01:39:21,511 --> 01:39:23,730
round peg and and shoved me into that 
whole.

2371
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:26,290
You're only gonna get so far.
You know what you're.

2372
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:28,290
But then you're trying to say,
okay,

2373
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:33,291
let's take all the wacky kids.
I put them in a special class and take 

2374
01:39:33,291 --> 01:39:33,650
all these kids who are definitely going 
to be construction workers.

2375
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:34,490
Put them in this.
No,

2376
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:39,500
I don't think that.
I think there should be other 

2377
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,331
opportunities.
Be like some people don't want to be 

2378
01:39:41,331 --> 01:39:41,331
comedians.
You know?

2379
01:39:41,331 --> 01:39:44,520
Some people don't want to be singers,
but there should be some sort of like an

2380
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:48,570
avenue that you find is interesting and 
you can go towards it in school.

2381
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:49,610
You know what I'm saying?
Like,

2382
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:52,530
but there's no viable option for class 
clowns.

2383
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:56,970
No viable options for disruptive kids,
but disruptive kids have something.

2384
01:39:56,971 --> 01:39:58,350
There's something there.
First of all,

2385
01:39:58,351 --> 01:40:00,270
it's a terrible thing.
It's undisciplined.

2386
01:40:00,271 --> 01:40:02,160
It fucks up the school for the rest of 
kids.

2387
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:07,270
It may be and it's because one kid is 
imbalanced because one can probably 

2388
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:10,911
didn't get enough attention at home or 
one kid had an abusive family and this 

2389
01:40:10,911 --> 01:40:14,181
is the way he learned how to get 
attention by lashing out and focusing 

2390
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:14,181
attention on himself.

2391
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:18,530
That said,
you got a kid who's willing to do some 

2392
01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:18,530
crazy shit that other kids aren't 
willing to do now.

2393
01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:18,830
Okay,
so you,

2394
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:20,880
you're not going to fix them.
You can.

2395
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:22,290
You can teach him about,
you know,

2396
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:27,360
the consequences of him doing that and 
how he's fucking it up for everybody 

2397
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,591
else in.
That creates bad energy and this is 

2398
01:40:30,591 --> 01:40:32,181
where we're going to focus your energy,
but you're not going to take away that 

2399
01:40:32,181 --> 01:40:32,181
energy,
that crazy energy that some people have.

2400
01:40:32,181 --> 01:40:33,750
It just needs to be filled.
That was really bad.

2401
01:40:33,751 --> 01:40:36,570
I was the kid in high school.
That was like,

2402
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:38,780
if you just applied yourself,
Jason,

2403
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:39,750
you just.
Well,

2404
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,300
I did that completely different 
direction.

2405
01:40:42,450 --> 01:40:45,750
I did fighting I,
that's what people don't understand that

2406
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:49,050
you apply yourself in that way.
Somehow or another that's not valid.

2407
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,130
Like because some aren't.
They're like,

2408
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,260
yeah.
For me it was art.

2409
01:40:53,261 --> 01:40:55,900
I used to draw a lot and uh,
in martial arts.

2410
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:00,960
So those were the two things and neither
one of them seemed like any sort of a 

2411
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:00,960
viable career option,
you know,

2412
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:00,960
there was no money in.

2413
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:06,060
You didn't think about animation being a
cartoonist because that's what I 

2414
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:06,310
thought.
Either a cartoonist or doing radio.

2415
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:07,990
So the whole time I'm going to school,
I'm like,

2416
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:09,820
you know,
I don't fucking care about math history.

2417
01:41:09,821 --> 01:41:12,010
I'm not just going to sleep because I 
don't care about any of this.

2418
01:41:12,011 --> 01:41:13,720
I'm never gonna use it.
I kind of knew that the whole.

2419
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,180
Have you ever thought about animation?
No.

2420
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:17,870
Watch thing about animation

2421
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:20,330
because I was like a huge Disney fan 
cartoon fan.

2422
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:23,460
It was more comic books.
I love comic books.

2423
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:25,230
Comic books too.
That's how I got into it.

2424
01:41:25,231 --> 01:41:30,231
Yeah.
I definitely had aspirations to be a 

2425
01:41:30,231 --> 01:41:31,851
comic book artists.
We talked about this on one of the 

2426
01:41:31,851 --> 01:41:33,891
earlier podcast,
but I just had a really douchey art 

2427
01:41:33,891 --> 01:41:36,051
teacher in high school and he had me 
convinced I was going to have to draw 

2428
01:41:36,051 --> 01:41:38,120
like diaper ads and shit and you're 
going to be boring and bad teachers.

2429
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:40,830
There's so many people have bad 
teachers.

2430
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:42,750
I mean,
he wasn't a bad teacher.

2431
01:41:42,751 --> 01:41:46,800
He's just a bad socially.
He was a beaten man with no spine.

2432
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:51,950
He was.
He had a week will and he didn't like 

2433
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:51,950
being around me.
I was his martial arts fighter.

2434
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:53,690
This kid who was fighting in taekwondo 
tournaments,

2435
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,860
I was at like taekwondo championship tee
shirts.

2436
01:41:55,861 --> 01:42:00,861
I'm also proud that I won all these 
taekwondo tournament soda where 

2437
01:42:00,861 --> 01:42:04,440
Taekwondo Shit everywhere because it was
the first thing I was ever any good at 

2438
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:04,650
high school.

2439
01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:06,720
I knew that kid.
He was a karate champion,

2440
01:42:06,810 --> 01:42:08,810
bro.
I begged that allows like 50.

2441
01:42:08,811 --> 01:42:13,811
I begged the spar,
Keith Bart and I didn't realize that I 

2442
01:42:13,811 --> 01:42:14,520
was scaring him because he like.
I was like,

2443
01:42:14,521 --> 01:42:15,000
yeah,
yeah.

2444
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:15,870
Oh,
we're gonna fight.

2445
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:20,930
You just kicked me.
Use your karate and I know how to 

2446
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:24,321
wrestle.
I'm going to try to fight you and then 

2447
01:42:24,321 --> 01:42:26,090
we'll see who wins that.
I'm telling this to this kid who 

2448
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:26,090
committed like,
fuck that.

2449
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:30,621
I found out the future of MMA when I was
15 years old when I was a sophomore in 

2450
01:42:30,621 --> 01:42:31,710
high school.
Actually I think it was 14.

2451
01:42:31,711 --> 01:42:34,170
My friend Steven Arduino was on the 
wrestling team.

2452
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:36,360
It was a good wrestler and I wasn't 
wrestling.

2453
01:42:36,361 --> 01:42:38,100
I was just doing taekwondo and we were 
really good friends.

2454
01:42:38,101 --> 01:42:39,720
We were always talking about like,
you know,

2455
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:42,570
like just to punch in the face.

2456
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:43,260
I'd be like,
bitch,

2457
01:42:43,261 --> 01:42:45,000
you can't take me down.
And we went out.

2458
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:50,480
We went out in the grass and this 
motherfucker took me down over and over 

2459
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:51,720
again.
It was so sad because it was so easy for

2460
01:42:51,721 --> 01:42:53,730
him to tell out.
I had no wrestling at all.

2461
01:42:53,731 --> 01:42:55,620
I had no.
I've never even thought about wrestling.

2462
01:42:55,621 --> 01:43:00,621
Someone except like fucking around with 
my friends and he just went fucking 

2463
01:43:00,621 --> 01:43:00,621
standard.
Finally put his hand on my face,

2464
01:43:00,621 --> 01:43:02,010
shoot a double bang.
I'll be on my back.

2465
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:03,570
No,
no,

2466
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,020
no,
no,

2467
01:43:04,021 --> 01:43:09,021
no.
It was just me stopped and we were 

2468
01:43:09,021 --> 01:43:10,221
friends.
It was just me stopping him from taking 

2469
01:43:10,221 --> 01:43:10,221
me down.
Mixed martial arts.

2470
01:43:10,221 --> 01:43:14,190
Right.
My Fat Chubby friend named Pierre showed

2471
01:43:14,191 --> 01:43:19,191
me the UFC,
the early ones with the fucking 

2472
01:43:19,191 --> 01:43:19,191
headbutts and everything and showed me 
like valitude Oh,

2473
01:43:19,191 --> 01:43:20,530
Brazil at.
He was like,

2474
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,630
shouldn't be the doer,
UFC at the time,

2475
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:25,470
but like I 90,
95 or six.

2476
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:30,590
He showed me those and I pedro,
or a Barco who was verses Paul Bartlett 

2477
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:31,140
and I was like,
yes.

2478
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:32,910
Yeah,
exactly.

2479
01:43:32,911 --> 01:43:34,440
So I was like,
man,

2480
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,070
I was like,
oh,

2481
01:43:35,071 --> 01:43:36,570
I could do this.
And he's like,

2482
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,780
do you want to spar me?
That'll like,

2483
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:42,450
you mean fight in the backyard?
And he's like,

2484
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:43,590
yeah,
yeah,

2485
01:43:43,591 --> 01:43:44,520
yeah,
we'll spar,

2486
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:45,130
you know,
we'll,

2487
01:43:45,150 --> 01:43:50,150
we'll,
where production was this kind of 

2488
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:50,150
martial artists,
I'm going to kill you.

2489
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:51,380
I thought,
Oh,

2490
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:51,900
you know,

2491
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:55,880
bubble be bubbles as the front yard is 
giant fat black kid.

2492
01:43:55,881 --> 01:43:57,980
He's like 300 pounds is like the 
scariest dude.

2493
01:43:57,981 --> 01:43:59,780
I beat the shit out of him because I 
knew how to fight.

2494
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:04,960
Like I would,
I would always spar around with my dad 

2495
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,950
so I knew how to box and stuff and 
whatever he we go out in the backyard.

2496
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:11,120
We said I had this breakdancing,
Matt that I had.

2497
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:14,180
We laid that down on top of the grass so
we had some padding because I do.

2498
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:16,160
I was going to fuck him off,
man.

2499
01:44:16,161 --> 01:44:19,220
We squared off in our hockey chest 
protectors.

2500
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:23,840
He fucking spin kicked me into fuck in 
my bread basket.

2501
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:26,120
I've never been kick like that.
I was like,

2502
01:44:26,121 --> 01:44:28,430
oh my God.
So I went to the Miller,

2503
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,520
the Miller standby and it is to move.
I always did.

2504
01:44:31,521 --> 01:44:33,680
My Dad taught me and it worked all the 
time.

2505
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:34,910
One,
two,

2506
01:44:34,911 --> 01:44:36,650
and if that none of that knock them down
on the ground,

2507
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:42,160
you grab his head,
which I did and threw him down on the 

2508
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,280
ground.
I did that and started wailing on him.

2509
01:44:43,281 --> 01:44:44,210
Like I was like,
I'm winning,

2510
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:49,270
I'm winning.
He starts wiggling around and shit and 

2511
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:52,661
the next thing I know he locked me up.
I'm fucking waking up in my backyard 

2512
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:57,470
looking at the trees like quietly and 
he's looking down at me and I'm like,

2513
01:44:57,950 --> 01:44:59,570
oh my God.
He's like,

2514
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,250
wow,
that was a triangle choke.

2515
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:06,700
I learned that in Gracie Jiu Jitsu.
That was the first time I ever did that 

2516
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:06,700
to somebody.
I'm like,

2517
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:07,220
fuck,
I gotta look this shit.

2518
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:11,000
He's tiny.
He decided to fight.

2519
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:16,030
Yeah.
My Dad was looking out the window 

2520
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:16,660
laughing at me like,
are you fucking mad?

2521
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,500
I was sleeping.
I was like,

2522
01:45:18,501 --> 01:45:21,410
I never.
I never knew that there was some magical

2523
01:45:21,411 --> 01:45:21,770
shit.

2524
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:22,910
What's wrong?
The ground?

2525
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:28,090
I just figured it's like wrestling.
I wrestled a little bit in high school 

2526
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:28,090
and I figured,
you know,

2527
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:29,450
until I realized you have to wear this 
tight ass pants on.

2528
01:45:29,451 --> 01:45:31,100
I quit,
and then I was like,

2529
01:45:31,101 --> 01:45:32,480
wow.
Then he just,

2530
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:34,130
he beat me.
He was on his back.

2531
01:45:34,131 --> 01:45:36,550
I was waiting,
I was winning and I saw that on,

2532
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:38,690
but I saw gracie do it,
but I was like,

2533
01:45:38,691 --> 01:45:39,170
yeah,
right.

2534
01:45:39,171 --> 01:45:40,820
It's just because he's wearing a stupid 
pajamas.

2535
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:45,940
So fun thing to be able to do to people.
You know what you don't realize how 

2536
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:47,570
powerful Jujitsu is.
Wrestling is.

2537
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:49,790
Were you getting a night nightclub 
altercation?

2538
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:53,270
Like push somebody off balance like,
oh my God,

2539
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:58,410
they met like feels like Bambi on ice.
Their feet are all slipping to stand 

2540
01:45:58,790 --> 01:46:00,200
other shoes on,
man.

2541
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:02,600
You're on the floor.
Those leather shoes are so ridiculous.

2542
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,990
Like wearing leather shoes is just be 
just going out like in handcuffs.

2543
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:08,540
I like pro wrestling boots when I go out
to the club.

2544
01:46:08,541 --> 01:46:09,660
Yeah,
no doubt.

2545
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:14,150
Pro Wrestling all day at least up to the
beat for real.

2546
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:19,180
Get on pro wrestling shoes.
I call a pro wrestling boots because 

2547
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:19,190
dude,
they're like,

2548
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:21,030
but you weren't there.
No.

2549
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:23,690
They have their tennis shoes.
They're tennis shoes,

2550
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:26,230
but he looked like classy a shoes and 
then they,

2551
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:29,390
they lace up to like super high chicks 
love.

2552
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:30,620
When I was young,
I was so stupid.

2553
01:46:30,621 --> 01:46:35,621
Every time I bought a pair of parents,
I would have to make sure that I can 

2554
01:46:35,621 --> 01:46:35,621
kick somebody in the head.
I was like,

2555
01:46:35,621 --> 01:46:37,460
practice taekwondo,
kicks with my fucking pants on.

2556
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:40,360
Just to make sure if the shit goes down,
I'm going to make sure I know,

2557
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:41,330
you know,
Yo,

2558
01:46:41,331 --> 01:46:42,500
you know,
my old man,

2559
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,870
he was an army for years,
20 years,

2560
01:46:44,871 --> 01:46:45,500
something like that.

2561
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:50,620
And he was like a religion motherfucker 
like went to war and kill people with 

2562
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:50,620
whatever.
He,

2563
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:53,730
he's these like kind of a bad.
He's an old fucker fat bastard now.

2564
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:54,720
But,
but uh,

2565
01:46:54,721 --> 01:46:57,240
he uh,
and he went to Korea,

2566
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:57,930
you know,
to,

2567
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:58,860
to like,
well I don't know,

2568
01:46:58,861 --> 01:47:03,861
whatever training or whatever.
And he had a post op at the Korean 

2569
01:47:03,861 --> 01:47:03,861
border,
you know,

2570
01:47:03,861 --> 01:47:05,760
like they do that over there.
He sees there,

2571
01:47:05,761 --> 01:47:08,300
he tells me when he comes back and I'm 
like 11,

2572
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:11,880
he's telling me this story when I was in
a bar out there,

2573
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:13,980
this little Chinese guy,
I'm like,

2574
01:47:13,981 --> 01:47:14,760
Dad,
you're in Korea.

2575
01:47:15,070 --> 01:47:20,070
Little Chinese guy got into it with me.
He kicked me in the fucking face.

2576
01:47:20,181 --> 01:47:22,160
I'm like,
what would it be filled out?

2577
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:22,890
He's like,
no,

2578
01:47:22,891 --> 01:47:27,891
he kicked me in the face.
He bought me a taekwondo uniform with 

2579
01:47:27,891 --> 01:47:27,891
it.
You need to practice this.

2580
01:47:27,891 --> 01:47:28,290
And I was like,
I don't know,

2581
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:33,291
like 10.
And I went to taekwondo because of that 

2582
01:47:33,291 --> 01:47:33,291
story.
My Dad got kicked in the face,

2583
01:47:33,291 --> 01:47:37,581
my taekwondo diarrheas imagine your dad 
looking out the window laughing while 

2584
01:47:37,581 --> 01:47:42,231
your uncle over the sink over the sink.
And he's laughing at me and I'm like,

2585
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:47,751
Damn,
you need a dad like that to become a 

2586
01:47:47,751 --> 01:47:47,751
jason mayhem.

2587
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:50,910
Make a guy like,
you know,

2588
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:53,490
I know,
I remember the Brazilians,

2589
01:47:53,491 --> 01:47:53,920
uh,
uh,

2590
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,010
when I was doing tournaments all the 
time when I was really young,

2591
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:56,880
18,
19,

2592
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:02,120
the Brazilians got a crazy story of me 
because I would always tell these 

2593
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,870
stories where me and my dad will fight 
whatever and we'd get into it and,

2594
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:08,490
or we spar around and we'd start off as 
a joke and it would get real.

2595
01:48:08,491 --> 01:48:13,491
Like we'd fucking really fight.
And I would tell those stories to the 

2596
01:48:13,491 --> 01:48:13,491
Brazilians.
And then it got a story like,

2597
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:15,330
man,
I heard Jason Miller,

2598
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:19,740
his dad would hit them with beer bottles
to make him tougher to the most American

2599
01:48:19,741 --> 01:48:24,610
Indian sound and Brazilian accent.
Fucking tonto and shit.

2600
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:29,750
Great winter north by bad my.
But you get the point.

2601
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:33,800
The guy was like,
yeah,

2602
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,880
everybody thought that my dad beat the 
shit out of me.

2603
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,000
He did,
but like it was a lot of times it was 

2604
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,551
like,
I remember we were like getting into it 

2605
01:48:43,551 --> 01:48:43,710
in the kitchen and I was like,
fucking fight with them.

2606
01:48:43,711 --> 01:48:45,120
And then he grabbed me around and be 
like,

2607
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:46,800
it was,
we didn't call rear naked choke.

2608
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:48,780
It was a sleeper hold.
He got me in a sleeper hold.

2609
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:50,940
I was like,
choking and I wouldn't quit.

2610
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:51,470
He's like,
boy,

2611
01:48:51,490 --> 01:48:53,000
tap out boy,
top out,

2612
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:54,510
you know,
and I was like,

2613
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:55,200
I don't know,
14,

2614
01:48:55,201 --> 01:48:56,340
15.
And I was like,

2615
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:58,680
he's choking me and choking me.
And I was like,

2616
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:00,360
fuck that.
I'm not going to tap out.

2617
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:04,170
And I just remember him finally.
He let me go because he's like,

2618
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:04,860
ah,
that's enough.

2619
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:09,270
But it was too late.
I remember reaching for the refrigerator

2620
01:49:09,271 --> 01:49:11,880
handle.
I think waking up and condiments,

2621
01:49:11,881 --> 01:49:13,050
like I put me out.
I was like,

2622
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,240
covered in like the fucking band aids 
and shit mustard and like,

2623
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:18,720
and he's laughing because I have my 
mom's like,

2624
01:49:18,721 --> 01:49:20,000
well,
you know,

2625
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:24,060
like dad choke me out.
He was laughing,

2626
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:25,710
oh,
was this an actual fight?

2627
01:49:25,711 --> 01:49:29,040
Fight players playing who were playing,
but listen man,

2628
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:31,740
and redneck culture,
you have to understand that if there's a

2629
01:49:31,741 --> 01:49:35,670
line that's drawn like your plan and 
then you're not really playing anymore,

2630
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:40,790
and then it's uh,
it comes from one step for somebody 

2631
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:41,430
biting somebody or I can get a good 
shot.

2632
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:42,390
Yeah,
exactly.

2633
01:49:42,391 --> 01:49:44,220
You know,
and I can understand that and I'm not,

2634
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:49,250
I'm proud.
I'm proud that I came from such a 

2635
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:49,250
strange.
Like I

2636
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,290
don't care.
Like I'm a professional fighter.

2637
01:49:50,291 --> 01:49:53,800
I'm not God damn kindergarten teacher.
One Time my dad threw a jolly rancher at

2638
01:49:53,801 --> 01:49:56,160
me and hit me in the eye of God.
You're homosexual.

2639
01:49:59,430 --> 01:50:03,490
No fucking crying.
Stung.

2640
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,270
Just look him in the eyes and eat it.
Well,

2641
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:08,170
two face do to get a jolly read through 
to the Ip.

2642
01:50:08,171 --> 01:50:09,400
Fucking stung.
He missed.

2643
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:11,370
He totally overthrew it.
Hit me right in.

2644
01:50:11,410 --> 01:50:14,420
He was throwing it to you.
God has stored is even worse.

2645
01:50:15,330 --> 01:50:16,600
Even abusive.
This store,

2646
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:21,210
his dad's going to get hurt.
So vicious wrist action.

2647
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,510
Like softball in college,
right?

2648
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:29,620
Motherfucker.
You ever seen those chicks that throw a 

2649
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:32,240
softball on the rubber band thing that 
that big step throw harder on late night

2650
01:50:34,121 --> 01:50:36,250
tv.
Like who the hell?

2651
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:40,840
Why are softball players watching espn 
and how fast I throw that under hand.

2652
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:42,820
I don't know.
Probably like 60 miles an hour,

2653
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:44,380
but the thing is they could do it all 
day.

2654
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:47,410
It's like a way more natural movement 
than like a regular picture,

2655
01:50:47,411 --> 01:50:49,660
like a picture.
That shit blows your shoulder,

2656
01:50:50,970 --> 01:50:55,970
your shoulder out at all.
I don't know if it's that they're 

2657
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:56,170
throwing it harder.
I think it's the mechanism.

2658
01:50:56,190 --> 01:51:01,190
Are you waiting?
Are you saying that there will be some 

2659
01:51:01,190 --> 01:51:03,361
kid from little league up who's been 
taught under head and think about this 

2660
01:51:03,361 --> 01:51:06,610
with a big juiced out arm.
He could throw that shit super hard.

2661
01:51:06,611 --> 01:51:11,611
Wonder.
I wonder because it doesn't seem like 

2662
01:51:11,611 --> 01:51:11,611
girls can do that shit all day and it 
doesn't blow their arm out,

2663
01:51:11,611 --> 01:51:13,900
but I think there's something about 
throwing like that.

2664
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:15,970
It's.
I think you can get more velocity,

2665
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:21,320
especially naturally,
but I have like flexible tendency shit,

2666
01:51:21,970 --> 01:51:26,970
like a real flexible.
When I throw a fucking baseball by our 

2667
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:27,910
building's gonna blow out of it's side 
like dad,

2668
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:30,610
the same thing he got out of ranger 
school.

2669
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:33,280
He didn't make it through ranger school.
He couldn't throw the fucking grenade.

2670
01:51:33,281 --> 01:51:34,690
Right.
Same Shit.

2671
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,040
Wow.
The bad shoulder.

2672
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:41,180
He talks about flexible tenants.
You could see that shit online if you 

2673
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:41,730
watch his fight.
And was it super raw bytes,

2674
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:44,340
man.
Anyway,

2675
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:46,120
he twisted my arm backwards.
I was like,

2676
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:51,150
oh my God,
he's going to break it off and I just 

2677
01:51:51,150 --> 01:51:51,970
toughed it out and then I and I and then
I got up and I was like,

2678
01:51:52,210 --> 01:51:53,260
oh,
it's good.

2679
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:56,860
And I just went and asked the guy with 
that same head that he was twisted.

2680
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:59,800
It's the most ridiculous Kamora defense 
ever.

2681
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:03,280
If you ever see the road map so bad.
I was like,

2682
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:04,790
I didn't even know it.
Anyway,

2683
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:05,440
Egan.
Anyway,

2684
01:52:05,441 --> 01:52:07,180
who's this bad ass Jujitsu?
Black belt.

2685
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:08,380
Bad motherfucker yoked.

2686
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:11,710
Damn,
this guy's a legend.

2687
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:13,930
You fought them in Hawaii and where they
hated me,

2688
01:52:13,931 --> 01:52:16,750
they were like telling me to die.
Die On the whole.

2689
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:17,830
But Dude,
you know,

2690
01:52:17,831 --> 01:52:22,440
Hawaii is a,
a crazy ass place for people ever.

2691
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:25,750
Hawaiians,
Hawaiians are all just all about.

2692
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:32,200
They're like hippies and that live in 
their own lions beat the fuck out of 

2693
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,090
each other.
They do in movies,

2694
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:37,420
videos in real.
There's definitely,

2695
01:52:37,421 --> 01:52:40,690
definitely parts of people.
But then Hawaiian community as a whole.

2696
01:52:40,691 --> 01:52:45,691
I think people are friendly,
but that doesn't mean that they don't 

2697
01:52:45,691 --> 01:52:46,010
beat the fuck out of people beating

2698
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:48,390
the crap out of everybody.
No,

2699
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:48,790
no,
no,

2700
01:52:48,810 --> 01:52:53,810
but what I'm saying,
so why people in Hawaii are notorious 

2701
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:54,410
for wanting to fight.
It's like a part of their culture.

2702
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:56,360
If you go online,
there's all these,

2703
01:52:56,361 --> 01:52:59,090
a backyard fights or Hawaiian backyard 
fights.

2704
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:00,740
Dude,
there's so many of them.

2705
01:53:00,741 --> 01:53:03,170
There's thousands on beach fights in 
backyard fights.

2706
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:08,290
Will dudes meet afterschool kids meet 
after school and they just have mma 

2707
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:08,290
fights.
Bare knuckle.

2708
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:09,770
They just duke it out on the grass and 
Hawaii.

2709
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:14,940
But would you,
would you say that if you talk to most 

2710
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:14,940
people,
like how was your trip to Hawaii

2711
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:17,100
brought up,
you're going to the resort and you know,

2712
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:20,380
it's a story about the first time I 
fought and super ball.

2713
01:53:20,381 --> 01:53:22,210
Here's a perfect example.
Okay.

2714
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:25,280
The first time I fought superbowl I got 
cut above the eye.

2715
01:53:25,281 --> 01:53:30,281
It was walk around Waikiki at some kid 
with a guy from Super Bra.

2716
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:32,570
And I was like,
Yay.

2717
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:33,520
Yeah,
what's up dude?

2718
01:53:33,521 --> 01:53:34,330
And he's like,
oh,

2719
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,970
what's up man?
Yeah man,

2720
01:53:36,971 --> 01:53:38,020
I'm tough.
I'm tough.

2721
01:53:38,230 --> 01:53:39,670
And I'm like,
oh cool bro.

2722
01:53:39,671 --> 01:53:41,680
He was like 16 years old,
15 years old,

2723
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:45,070
some fat white tourist is walking down.
He's like,

2724
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:45,740
well,
what?

2725
01:53:45,910 --> 01:53:48,760
He wants this?
And he walks over and bends down,

2726
01:53:48,761 --> 01:53:51,330
like he's tying his shoe and he's like 
looking at his peripheral vision,

2727
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:54,610
sees this guy walking.
He stands up and the guy bumps into him.

2728
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:55,390
Oh,
sorry man.

2729
01:53:56,650 --> 01:54:01,450
This Hawaiian kids started beating the 
shit out of him because he's young.

2730
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:06,480
He's so young that it's not really 
hurting them like that really hurt the 

2731
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,451
guy.
But the guy looks up and he's got a 

2732
01:54:09,451 --> 01:54:09,451
buddy with them,
doesn't help them at all.

2733
01:54:09,451 --> 01:54:12,100
The kid starts in Hawaiian,
you call it false cracking.

2734
01:54:12,101 --> 01:54:13,600
The guy,
it's a sucker punch.

2735
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:14,530
He like,
gets up.

2736
01:54:14,531 --> 01:54:15,820
It's sucker punch.
The Guy,

2737
01:54:15,821 --> 01:54:20,821
he was ah,
he grabs on his backpack and jump 

2738
01:54:20,821 --> 01:54:20,821
kicking him,
jumped,

2739
01:54:20,821 --> 01:54:20,821
kicking him,
jumping.

2740
01:54:20,821 --> 01:54:21,310
The guy started running up.
He goes,

2741
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:27,270
my first trip to Hawaii,
Hawaiian people are crazy.

2742
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:30,830
Getting Sarah Marshall.
I think so the movie's forgetting.

2743
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:35,831
Sarah Marshall.
There was the bartender who is super 

2744
01:54:35,831 --> 01:54:37,811
cool.
That was the part of the movie I was 

2745
01:54:37,811 --> 01:54:37,811
talking about afterwards,
maybe from the movies.

2746
01:54:37,811 --> 01:54:38,260
That's what I was talking about.
No,

2747
01:54:38,261 --> 01:54:40,970
but afterwards he got kicked his ass.
That's like real life.

2748
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:42,240
Well,
I mean,

2749
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:44,420
why does that?
I've never heard any of my.

2750
01:54:44,450 --> 01:54:46,410
Anyone ever say go.
I went to Hawaii.

2751
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:47,390
Dude.
It was fucking fight.

2752
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:50,320
You're talking about going to Hawaii 
where you go to resorts.

2753
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:54,430
Lazy Wilco.

2754
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:58,900
The nicest people ever.
But I go up to and I bet you they'll try

2755
01:54:58,901 --> 01:54:59,240
to gut.

2756
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:01,240
Yeah.
When you talk to Bj Penn,

2757
01:55:01,420 --> 01:55:03,080
Bj Penn talks about growing up in a 
wire.

2758
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:05,040
It's always says there's nothing to do.
Everybody just fights.

2759
01:55:05,070 --> 01:55:07,390
I'm just saying if you're in that road,
it's definitely more,

2760
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:12,620
you know,
in your face then you like if most 

2761
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:13,270
people going to the store and a suburban
neighborhood in Hawaii's,

2762
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:14,290
you know,
or something like that.

2763
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:16,870
No one's saying that Hawaii people are 
douchebags.

2764
01:55:16,990 --> 01:55:18,650
No one's saying that there.
Is this a bad thing?

2765
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:19,250
No,
no,

2766
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:20,060
no,
no.

2767
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:22,760
I can explain it.
I like to find it there too.

2768
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:27,940
It's kind of the culture that you want 
to throw down and there's a mutual like,

2769
01:55:28,011 --> 01:55:29,900
let's fight.
Nobody shoots each other.

2770
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:31,550
Like,
let's fight,

2771
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:33,260
we'll fight and then we'll end it out.
Oh,

2772
01:55:33,261 --> 01:55:36,350
he kicked his ass and then you get the 
coconut wireless.

2773
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:38,960
Everybody knows about it.
He kicked his ass.

2774
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,100
That's,
you know,

2775
01:55:40,110 --> 01:55:41,540
that it's just the culture.
You know,

2776
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:43,980
and I think that pen came

2777
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,680
out of Bj Penn came out of that,
that sort of,

2778
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:49,380
you know,
that kind of competition is what started

2779
01:55:49,381 --> 01:55:54,381
as mma career.
That he was this bad motherfucker that 

2780
01:55:54,381 --> 01:55:56,421
would step to anybody to fight anybody.
He took pride in that and that's why he 

2781
01:55:56,421 --> 01:55:58,410
became an MMA champion when you're stuck
on a fucking island,

2782
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:03,860
the big island and they ain't that much 
people and everyone's just jammed in 

2783
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:03,860
together on this rock.
You know,

2784
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:04,950
tensions run high.
Oh Man,

2785
01:56:04,951 --> 01:56:06,810
I lived there too.
It's a strange,

2786
01:56:06,811 --> 01:56:08,620
strange,
different place because you're,

2787
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:12,300
you're on this tiny island and it's 
small because even though it's a billion

2788
01:56:12,301 --> 01:56:12,810
people,
whatever,

2789
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:17,130
whatever circles you run in our tight 
bit because everybody knows everybody,

2790
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:22,160
right?
It must be a lot of bullshit between 

2791
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,991
like dudes and girls and God pick 
imagined because everybody knows 

2792
01:56:24,031 --> 01:56:25,530
everybody.
Like that dude's faulconer.

2793
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:29,200
Like when someone breaks up,
she goes out with someone you know,

2794
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:30,930
went to high school with that other guy.

2795
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:33,300
Like it's so weird.
It's weird.

2796
01:56:33,301 --> 01:56:34,920
That causes tension.
It's painful.

2797
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:39,000
And you lived on the big island of 
Hawaii who was like the main island.

2798
01:56:39,001 --> 01:56:40,470
Isn't it crazy though?
The smaller.

2799
01:56:40,471 --> 01:56:42,390
It's not a big island.
It's not that big.

2800
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:45,210
It's like the boat.
I don't know why it's the.

2801
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:47,940
It was the biggest one that developed 
quickest.

2802
01:56:47,970 --> 01:56:52,970
It's so weird.
Most of the times when I've gone to 

2803
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:52,970
Hawaii,
I went to the big island,

2804
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:54,230
I went to Maui,
I went to a why,

2805
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:56,430
but when I went to a.
Oh,

2806
01:56:56,431 --> 01:56:57,240
I went to,
um,

2807
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:58,950
what's the other one is a little small 
one.

2808
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:00,420
I forget what you look.
I know,

2809
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:05,490
but when I went to Honolulu I was like,
God damn,

2810
01:57:05,491 --> 01:57:06,600
this is like a city.
It is,

2811
01:57:06,650 --> 01:57:07,560
it's not,
it's America.

2812
01:57:07,561 --> 01:57:09,360
It's America on wheels.
It's America,

2813
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:12,690
America.
It's the weirdest city ever.

2814
01:57:12,691 --> 01:57:14,220
It's like a fucking blade runner movie.

2815
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:19,490
It's like,
here you are in this city with this 

2816
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:19,500
incredibly beautiful weather with this 
amazing ocean.

2817
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:22,020
Like you are right there.
It's the city somehow or another,

2818
01:57:22,021 --> 01:57:24,750
but it's not that polluted the ocean's 
not that politically.

2819
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:29,770
Just wash it off.
Would you say is the best why park?

2820
01:57:30,421 --> 01:57:31,210
Yeah,
it's all like,

2821
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,430
it's like last year,
you know,

2822
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:36,270
like Lanai was gorgeous to the NIH is 
really small.

2823
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:39,480
Yeah.
Well I imagine it's even less developed.

2824
01:57:39,481 --> 01:57:40,610
The quiet,
quiet.

2825
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:46,240
There's one road I think it was.
I only have like 3000 people that live 

2826
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:46,490
on 30 days or something tiny.
It's a.

2827
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,810
and it's all like the staff throwing 
down,

2828
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,730
they tend to look a little fucking 
spaced out.

2829
01:57:53,731 --> 01:57:56,020
When I was asking for directions,
just fucking three roads.

2830
01:57:56,050 --> 01:57:57,720
This bitch couldn't tell me how to get 
to the hotel.

2831
01:57:57,950 --> 01:58:00,780
It's just like,
I think what's.

2832
01:58:01,110 --> 01:58:01,980
Know what here.

2833
01:58:02,050 --> 01:58:03,630
Here's the thing,
is that about that.

2834
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:04,880
When I lived in Hawaii,
Bro,

2835
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:09,060
I can't tell you what street to turn on.
I can tell you to get to the Waikiki,

2836
01:58:09,190 --> 01:58:11,100
you got to go down A.
There's a seven,

2837
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:12,780
11 at the end of this.
What Road?

2838
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:14,700
You take a right there,
you keep going down,

2839
01:58:14,701 --> 01:58:16,590
it turns into a one way and you take a 
right,

2840
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,400
zippy,
and then use.

2841
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:24,660
So you don't.
Nobody knows the world babes because 

2842
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:25,150
there were a lot of bad leaky Makkah and
condom.

2843
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:25,880
Oh whoa.
Hey.

2844
01:58:25,881 --> 01:58:30,881
I like what?
Like fucking nobody even knows the name 

2845
01:58:30,881 --> 01:58:30,881
of this road.
How crazy is that?

2846
01:58:30,881 --> 01:58:35,151
Hawaii is a part of America,
but it's five hours away on a fucking 

2847
01:58:35,151 --> 01:58:35,151
plane.
Alaska,

2848
01:58:35,151 --> 01:58:37,450
Alaska is not as crazy.
At least its landmass.

2849
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:41,980
You can drive to Alaska in the middle of

2850
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:42,490
it.
He's just like,

2851
01:58:42,491 --> 01:58:44,530
there's land in the middle of that.
Makes Sense.

2852
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:48,550
Totally ridiculous.
We've got to have our ass covered on all

2853
01:58:48,551 --> 01:58:50,510
sides for sure.
But I mean it's,

2854
01:58:50,511 --> 01:58:52,110
it's incredible that we can call that 
American.

2855
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:57,120
It's five hours away on a fucking plane 
and then Guam is like sort of America 

2856
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:58,060
where a pizza.
It was Puerto Rico.

2857
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:03,760
Puerto Rico is like sort of Puerto Rico 
is like considered America though taxes.

2858
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:09,961
So they don't want to be part of it.
Are you allowed to be from Puerto Rico 

2859
01:59:09,961 --> 01:59:10,960
and just immigrate to America?
So I think so too.

2860
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:12,790
That's why there's so many Puerto 
Ricans,

2861
01:59:13,050 --> 01:59:14,410
you know,
especially if you go to New York.

2862
01:59:14,690 --> 01:59:16,000
Oh yeah.
Oh for sure.

2863
01:59:16,030 --> 01:59:18,880
Don Gavin's is fucking comedian from 
Boston old legend.

2864
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:20,460
He used to have this joke about.
He says,

2865
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:22,150
real fast talking [inaudible] posten 
guy.

2866
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:22,710
He's like,
yeah,

2867
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:24,430
I went to Puerto Rican.
That didn't.

2868
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:27,190
Didn't like Puerto Rico too many fucking
Puerto Ricans.

2869
01:59:27,330 --> 01:59:29,200
I don't even know how they fought.
So expensive.

2870
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:32,830
I.
You've been doing standup comedy lately.

2871
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,750
How's that going?
Where's,

2872
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:36,570
where's the great mayhem doing?
Don't know.

2873
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:38,110
I know you did already show at the 
Improv.

2874
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:41,380
I did already start to show today.
I've been arrested.

2875
01:59:41,381 --> 01:59:43,330
A budget vibes.
He didn't even ask me to do the.

2876
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:44,510
I fought the law.

2877
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:49,240
Ours probably listening right now.
No,

2878
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:52,340
he is now.
He's not asleep.

2879
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:57,460
It might be that guy who doesn't care 
about fellow ladies and gentlemen,

2880
01:59:57,461 --> 02:00:00,790
bringing us back to our final sponsor.
This flashlight.

2881
02:00:00,791 --> 02:00:04,350
If you want to masturbate,
this is your home by looking at them.

2882
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:07,210
If you go to fleshlight dotcom too,
if you go to my website,

2883
02:00:07,211 --> 02:00:09,580
there's a link and you get 15 percent 
off your flashlight.

2884
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,570
The weirdest spots or I reckon it's the 
best sponsor.

2885
02:00:13,571 --> 02:00:15,220
Come on my show.
It's fucking nuts.

2886
02:00:15,221 --> 02:00:20,221
This whole thing is crazy.
That's why I've got crazy people like 

2887
02:00:20,221 --> 02:00:22,831
you on.
Nobody else would have got this kind of 

2888
02:00:22,831 --> 02:00:22,831
an interview at a mayhem.
We had a.

2889
02:00:22,831 --> 02:00:24,410
We had to put it together.
Exactly.

2890
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:25,570
We're hanging,
bro.

2891
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:28,760
Don't do that.
Did you fuck.

2892
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:30,370
Fuck.
Oh,

2893
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:33,870
that's awesome.
It's Queef and all over the mic.

2894
02:00:34,090 --> 02:00:38,750
Like feel how natural it feels.
Terrible.

2895
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:45,680
Terrible.
After all the dirty pussy and asshole 

2896
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:45,680
we've been talking about.
See if it's salty.

2897
02:00:49,620 --> 02:00:52,150
The tester like tested by number four.
Oh,

2898
02:00:52,151 --> 02:00:53,140
seven years.
A guy going,

2899
02:00:53,150 --> 02:00:58,150
I just want to make cock feels so yummy.
Yeah,

2900
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:02,650
right.
Imagine if some dude did.

2901
02:01:02,651 --> 02:01:07,651
Fuck it.
Because you're just going to head to 

2902
02:01:07,651 --> 02:01:09,810
lunch.
If he knew it was going to the 

2903
02:01:09,810 --> 02:01:09,810
insurance.
Yeah.

2904
02:01:09,810 --> 02:01:09,810
I mean you can't have a faulty,
fake vagina.

2905
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:11,410
Imagine that job,
but that was your job.

2906
02:01:11,411 --> 02:01:15,300
You have to do that all day long.
Oh good.

2907
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:18,040
That's ridiculous.
Good Hope by God.

2908
02:01:18,041 --> 02:01:21,550
There's probably a job like that.
I'm appalled that this podcast.

2909
02:01:22,190 --> 02:01:25,630
I think we've reached the bottom.
This is the end of the line.

2910
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:27,610
We have a website,
right?

2911
02:01:27,611 --> 02:01:30,370
Mayhem.
Maynard Miller on twitter.

2912
02:01:30,410 --> 02:01:32,350
Yeah.
I may have Miller all across the board.

2913
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:35,500
May Have Miller everywhere.
You don't use my space anymore.

2914
02:01:35,501 --> 02:01:39,730
Do you feel bad?
I like.

2915
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:40,040
You

2916
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:45,040
know what?
I know that there's chicks out there 

2917
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:45,040
that want to bump me up my eyes,
but I don't really go on there.

2918
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:49,450
I can't even go on there and I got is 
when you see a girl that's still on my 

2919
02:01:49,450 --> 02:01:50,360
space,
like this is my space.

2920
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:55,470
That might be a girl that's retarded 
lower percentage if you're.

2921
02:01:55,500 --> 02:02:00,500
If you're not on my end,
unless she's picking up the king of the 

2922
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:00,500
scraps,
she might be there.

2923
02:02:00,501 --> 02:02:01,130
Might be like,
dude,

2924
02:02:01,131 --> 02:02:05,330
I am the most popular person on myspace.
Tila,

2925
02:02:05,331 --> 02:02:07,520
Tequila part three.
I've got 4,000

2926
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:09,740
friends,
40,000

2927
02:02:09,741 --> 02:02:11,570
active friends.
A lot of girls claimed 40,000

2928
02:02:11,571 --> 02:02:12,980
friends by.
Really?

2929
02:02:12,981 --> 02:02:17,981
Yeah.
I got no bots on who the fuck is left 

2930
02:02:17,981 --> 02:02:17,981
on?
Myspace was computers.

2931
02:02:17,981 --> 02:02:19,540
Log are so old.
They can't even work.

2932
02:02:19,550 --> 02:02:22,580
Facebook,
our friend just quit my space.

2933
02:02:22,581 --> 02:02:25,620
He used your work there and now I could 
finally get rid of my.

2934
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:30,620
My space.
I don't feel bad because I only held 

2935
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:30,620
onto it.
I think because of him.

2936
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:32,010
I've hoped that my space is going to 
make a comeback because I.

2937
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:37,180
back in the comedy store days,
myspace packed that fucking place all 

2938
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:40,361
the time.
That was responsible for getting to on 

2939
02:02:40,361 --> 02:02:40,820
facebook.
Don't know.

2940
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:43,040
The best is twitter.
Twitter is the best.

2941
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:44,450
Twitter is fun,
Dude.

2942
02:02:44,451 --> 02:02:46,130
I like talking to people.
I like.

2943
02:02:46,131 --> 02:02:47,840
People send me some shit and I send it 
back.

2944
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:53,210
Your fans are way smarter than mine 
because you always get cool shit sent to

2945
02:02:53,211 --> 02:02:54,130
you and I'm like,
what?

2946
02:02:54,131 --> 02:02:59,131
The cool shit to them too though.
Whenever I find a tweet tweeted,

2947
02:03:00,170 --> 02:03:02,420
I always tweet it,
tweet shit like that back to me,

2948
02:03:02,421 --> 02:03:07,421
but I find out all about a lot of cool 
articles and cool science developments 

2949
02:03:07,421 --> 02:03:09,160
and shit.
I find out a lot of that stuff on people

2950
02:03:09,310 --> 02:03:12,190
on a,
on twitter message out to you.

2951
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:17,200
Usually we all share and I don't.
I like stoked you come up with it.

2952
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:24,340
Oh cool.
Joe Rogan put an article and I click on 

2953
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:26,330
read it.
There's always so much cool shit on the 

2954
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:26,330
Internet,
man.

2955
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:27,340
Have you seen the Deepak Chopra?
Sam Harris,

2956
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:30,830
uh,
debates with them.

2957
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:36,010
I forget the dude's name.
And Deepak Chopra had this crazy cat 

2958
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:38,180
lady with them and they're debating God 
and it's some brilliant shit,

2959
02:03:38,181 --> 02:03:39,740
man.
Sam Harris is a brilliant,

2960
02:03:39,741 --> 02:03:44,741
brilliant motherfucker.
He wrote that really good book letters 

2961
02:03:44,741 --> 02:03:45,590
to a Christian nation.
He's a skeptic atheist character,

2962
02:03:45,591 --> 02:03:49,400
but a really reasonable dude.
Have you seen Dawkins versus A.

2963
02:03:49,401 --> 02:03:50,780
I can't remember.
He did a.

2964
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:53,560
He did a few where he was kind of a 
cheap buck show,

2965
02:03:53,610 --> 02:03:58,610
oprah,
but I didn't like his arguments against 

2966
02:03:58,610 --> 02:03:58,610
deep pocket.
It was very short.

2967
02:03:58,610 --> 02:03:59,870
The clip that he used online or in his 
documentary is very short.

2968
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:02,960
It was just mostly mocking depok,
but then when Deepak talked to them,

2969
02:04:02,961 --> 02:04:05,870
Deepak was actually pretty reasonable 
about what he was saying.

2970
02:04:05,871 --> 02:04:10,871
They were talking about states of mind 
and mood and the ability to help 

2971
02:04:10,871 --> 02:04:11,780
diseases and cause diseases like bad 
states of mind court,

2972
02:04:11,781 --> 02:04:14,720
which I,
I definitely think I agree with negative

2973
02:04:14,721 --> 02:04:19,721
people.
Like negative energy is manifested 

2974
02:04:19,721 --> 02:04:19,940
itself in stress.
Stress manifests itself in misfiring.

2975
02:04:19,941 --> 02:04:23,590
So I've had injuries before where the 
injury keeps.

2976
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:27,740
I don't even notice because like I just 
got caveman brain where I get hurt and I

2977
02:04:27,741 --> 02:04:29,450
just ignore that part of my body right 
now.

2978
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:34,580
I'll step on something and have a bloody
foot and just keep ignoring it until I 

2979
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:34,580
have to go to the hospital,
you know.

2980
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:37,980
So I kept doing that but I didn't 
realize the puts stress on your

2981
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,260
body.
And then I got super sick and I'm like,

2982
02:04:40,261 --> 02:04:45,261
why am I sick?
And got a hurt the business because you 

2983
02:04:45,261 --> 02:04:48,800
get in this mind state of being totally 
like feeling bad and irritated and hurt 

2984
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:50,370
and that your body breaks down.

2985
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:55,550
Yeah.
You need positive energy and a good 

2986
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:55,550
feeling of enjoyment of your life.
Appreciation for everything.

2987
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:57,600
All that good stuff makes you feel 
better,

2988
02:04:57,601 --> 02:04:59,790
makes you lighter.
It makes you have to work less hard.

2989
02:04:59,950 --> 02:05:02,730
Makes life less taxing.
When I'm going through a lot of bullshit

2990
02:05:02,731 --> 02:05:03,490
in my life,
man.

2991
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:04,980
Tired all the time,
you know,

2992
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:06,900
it's a lot of energy gets used up by 
that.

2993
02:05:06,901 --> 02:05:11,901
Don't you find that?
Like if you're in like a bad personal 

2994
02:05:11,901 --> 02:05:11,901
situation that you're fucking tired it.

2995
02:05:11,901 --> 02:05:13,800
Oh totally.
It's depression easily,

2996
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:14,670
you know.
I mean,

2997
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:17,100
it's depression,
it's depression,

2998
02:05:17,101 --> 02:05:19,400
but it's also energy.
Just bad feelings.

2999
02:05:19,401 --> 02:05:20,940
Somebody hates you.
Someone's mad at you.

3000
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:22,980
Well,
at the risk of sounding like a hippie.

3001
02:05:22,990 --> 02:05:23,760
Yeah.
Energies.

3002
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:25,920
Yeah.
It's totally sound like a hippie.

3003
02:05:25,921 --> 02:05:28,170
The problem is hippies fucked up a lot 
of cool shit.

3004
02:05:28,630 --> 02:05:32,400
Hippies connected a bit.
Hippie.

3005
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:34,980
Okay.
Because I've met awesome hippies.

3006
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:35,520
Yeah.
Okay.

3007
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:38,220
But the thought of a hippy is this silly
week,

3008
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:41,960
like just like the all he does like to 
lay around the fields.

3009
02:05:41,990 --> 02:05:42,050
And

3010
02:05:43,610 --> 02:05:45,440
Boulder,
when I was in boulder I got annoyed with

3011
02:05:45,441 --> 02:05:47,480
a lot of hippies.
This idealistic,

3012
02:05:47,481 --> 02:05:51,710
stupid point of trespass on your 
property and go,

3013
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:53,930
are you denying us access to the woods?
I'm like,

3014
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:56,180
fuck you fucking Douche bag.
This is my yard.

3015
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:59,990
And I bought the big yard,
but it's my fucking yard.

3016
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:02,990
How about use the woods over there where
it's just the woods.

3017
02:06:02,991 --> 02:06:06,380
You do this.
I owe but did north trail.

3018
02:06:06,381 --> 02:06:07,940
This is an awesome trail.
Yeah,

3019
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
that's why I fucking paid $16,000
a month.

3020
02:06:11,001 --> 02:06:11,600
You should head

3021
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:18,400
Mr Smithers get the fuck man.
It's like you want privacy man.

3022
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:20,000
Look,
you're,

3023
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:22,020
you're living full basket of tearing 
apart.

3024
02:06:22,021 --> 02:06:23,050
It's hippies in the bucket.

3025
02:06:24,670 --> 02:06:26,800
Bill Master was a nice dog.
He's cool.

3026
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:29,320
He'll let you know when people there,
but he's not like scary.

3027
02:06:29,410 --> 02:06:34,410
I like dogs.
My pit bulls when I used to have pit 

3028
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:34,410
bulls,
dad was like having monsters.

3029
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:35,090
That was like,
I kept monsters,

3030
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:35,190
right?

3031
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:36,550
No,
I was running.

3032
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:41,600
All right.
So I was at the north shore and this 

3033
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:44,041
dude house I was going to apparently he 
was like a famous drug dealer or 

3034
02:06:44,041 --> 02:06:45,850
something like that and I and my friends
went and ahead of me,

3035
02:06:45,851 --> 02:06:49,780
I forgot my swim shorts and I got it and
I walked there by myself and across this

3036
02:06:49,781 --> 02:06:53,360
giant yard,
a fucking giant pimples,

3037
02:06:53,361 --> 02:06:55,180
sprinty Gabby.
And I was like fuck.

3038
02:06:55,181 --> 02:06:58,140
And I was already in the gate like I 
could run out,

3039
02:06:58,150 --> 02:07:00,940
run them at this point,
no the fuck I got.

3040
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:02,710
I got like a fuck,
what do I do?

3041
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:03,700
What do I do?
And I was like,

3042
02:07:03,701 --> 02:07:05,100
stay calm and oh wait,
fuck it.

3043
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:11,360
Like that barked at him.
He stopped in his tracks and barked at 

3044
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:11,440
me.
We're best friends after that.

3045
02:07:11,590 --> 02:07:14,980
Like it was weird.
It was sometimes a bark at you.

3046
02:07:14,990 --> 02:07:16,930
They just want to get close to you and 
make sure you're okay.

3047
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:18,740
And then they're friendly.
That's what it was.

3048
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:21,640
I barked at him,
he barked at me and then I went,

3049
02:07:21,850 --> 02:07:23,080
here's your hands

3050
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:26,580
are some of the smartest fucking coolest
dogs as pets.

3051
02:07:26,581 --> 02:07:30,110
But it's such a pain in the ass because 
they just want to fight other dogs.

3052
02:07:30,111 --> 02:07:32,580
So they're always.
It's like hanging out with a crazy dude.

3053
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:34,440
The Alpha,
just to get your bite holding.

3054
02:07:34,441 --> 02:07:35,980
Let them smell your finger at works 
also.

3055
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,050
Oh Brian,
you did it again.

3056
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:40,240
How dare you.
That doesn't make sense.

3057
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:40,820
Yeah,
you can.

3058
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:42,670
It's like smelling.
They asked if a dog,

3059
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:46,420
if you let them smell this,
smell your asshole.

3060
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:48,880
You totally respect ever.
You see a big dog.

3061
02:07:48,881 --> 02:07:53,080
You figure blast like this.
Cool.

3062
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:56,280
What if he decides to attack and bite 
your hand never happened.

3063
02:07:56,290 --> 02:07:59,200
So they go into smell mode.
First of all,

3064
02:07:59,201 --> 02:08:00,110
they're not going to bite it.
Yeah,

3065
02:08:00,111 --> 02:08:02,240
it's crazy.
So you're being honest.

3066
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:03,820
It was actually advise.
Totally,

3067
02:08:03,821 --> 02:08:04,860
totally.
Try it out.

3068
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:07,930
You see a pit bull charging at you.
Grab your ass hole,

3069
02:08:08,290 --> 02:08:09,910
put a finger in,
let it smell it.

3070
02:08:09,911 --> 02:08:14,911
Make sure it's working.
Your theory is faulting you to try it 

3071
02:08:14,911 --> 02:08:14,911
out.
Some other dogs do.

3072
02:08:14,911 --> 02:08:16,210
When they see other dogs and tried to 
attack you,

3073
02:08:16,211 --> 02:08:18,170
you might have got lucky.
You're just used to smelling.

3074
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:21,930
I've just don't do it.
Don't math

3075
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:23,160
in the room.
Oh,

3076
02:08:23,161 --> 02:08:24,550
he did it.
Oh,

3077
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:29,050
he linked it.
Fucking show is over.

3078
02:08:29,051 --> 02:08:32,050
Ladies and gentlemen.
That's the end is the end of the line.

3079
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:36,850
I can't even believe he made a dog.
Smell his butt from his fingers.

3080
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:41,100
Go Wash your hands on your tummy,
Brian.

3081
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:43,440
Oh,
this is so nasty.

3082
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:44,860
Gentlemen.
