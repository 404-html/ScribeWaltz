1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,950
Four three, two, one.

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,620
And we're live. All right,
so to set this up, um,

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,610
when Gary was on last, Gary Tobbs, Stefan,

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,320
how do I say your last name? Stephanie.
DNA. DNA. DNA. It's like DNA,

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,700
like DNA with a g.
Right. Got It. Okay. Um,

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,300
when you were on last, Stephan had, uh,

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,850
some opposition to some of the
things that you were saying.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,500
We talked about getting him
on and you want it together.

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,760
We finally pulled it off.

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,780
Took there was a lot of wrangling was a
lot of back and forth and cat wrangling,

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,930
but we got it. We're here. Um,

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,010
give me your position on this
is all for folks listening,

13
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:52,720
this is all about obesity and
the mechanism for obesity.

14
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:53,620
Is that fair to say?

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,771
Yeah.
Yeah.

16
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:59,120
So essentially the main points
that we want to talk about today,

17
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:02,540
I'll try to keep this up just from your
face. Okay, sure. Just so you move around,

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,860
um, what causes obesity and
what causes insulin resistance,

19
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:11,390
which is behind a lot of our chronic
diseases that are common in society.

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,900
And please, uh, give us
your background. Yeah.

21
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,850
So I have a

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,530
bs in biochemistry,
Phd in neuroscience.

23
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,050
After getting my phd in neuroscience,

24
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,500
I went on to study the neuroscience of
obesity at the University of Washington

25
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:31,160
in particularly the brain circuits
that regulate body fatness.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,200
Hopefully we'll get a chance
to talk about those today.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,160
And then I went on to become a science
consultant at science communicator and

28
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:43,550
write a book called the
hungry brain. That is, um,

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,810
my attempt to explain for a non
specialist audience what, uh,

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,880
what causes obesity and uh,
yeah, so that's my background.

31
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,590
Now, what is your disagreement
with Gary's position? Everything.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,270
Everything. Yeah. So, uh,
how about, how about I just,

33
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:06,170
can I start by explaining what I believe
because it'd be saying I'm going to be

34
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:09,890
long winded here. Is that okay?
Go right ahead. All right.
We have ours. Okay, cool.

35
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,830
So first,
a little bit of housekeeping.

36
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm going to be citing a lot of evidence
today and so I want these bringing this

37
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:19,130
up to your focus. Sure. Just moving
around. Sure. If you want to sit back.

38
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,620
How's that? Perfect. Okay.

39
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,140
I'm going to be citing a lot of evidence
today and I want people to be able to

40
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,430
follow along at home.

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,500
And so I put many of the references that
I'm going to be siting on that so it

42
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:33,230
doesn't cover your face.
Okay, there we go. All right.

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,010
I put a lot of the references that I'm
going to be siting on my website Stephin

44
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,710
bna.com or if you don't
feel like spelling my name,

45
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:44,711
you can go to whole health source.org and
I have a numbered list of topics there

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,890
and I'm going to be calling out numbers.

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,180
Just scroll down to the number that I
referred to and the references are all

48
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:53,810
there.

49
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,590
The second thing I want to say that I
would want to be really clear about today

50
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:02,120
is that I'm not here to be the
anti low carb guy. Okay. Um,

51
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,880
I think low carb diets are valid
tool for a controlling body,

52
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,620
fatness and controlling blood sugar.

53
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,590
I'm not here to talk anybody out
of being on a low carb diet. Um,

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,830
what I am here to try to
talk people out of this.

55
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:18,820
Some of the mythology that has
accumulated around the low carb diet.

56
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,510
Okay, so I want to get started with an
analogy to help people understand, um,

57
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,760
why the brain is important and obesity.

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,290
So imagine you're an alien coming
down from outer space and you want to

59
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:36,160
understand what's going on on earth and
you notice that on the highway some cars

60
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:39,130
are traveling faster than others.
Some cars go faster,

61
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,740
some cars go slower and
you want to figure out why.

62
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,770
And so you go and you start studying the
tires of the cars because obviously the

63
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:52,540
amount of force that is exerted by the
tire onto the asphalt is the thing that

64
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,840
determines the speed of the car.
We know this, this is just physics.

65
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,580
And so you study the tires and you study
the tires and you study them and you

66
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:05,470
never figure out why some cars go
faster than others. Now why is that?

67
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,290
The reason is that you're studying
the wrong part of the system.

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,540
You want to understand the why.

69
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,200
Some cars go faster than others.

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,250
You have to understand the part of
the system that regulates speed,

71
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,840
and that is the person behind the wheel.
And so in this analogy,

72
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:26,500
the tires are fat cells and the
person behind the wheel is the brain.

73
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,480
There has been tons of research on fat
cell biology on what factors put fat in

74
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,810
fat cells,
what take it out.

75
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,070
It's been tons and tons of research on
that and it's intuitively obvious that we

76
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,670
should be studying that to understand
obesity, right? But in fact,

77
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:46,600
all of that research has yielded very
little insight into why some people are

78
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:51,070
fatter than others. That's because
it's the wrong part of the system.

79
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Study fat cells do not regulate the size
of fat cells any more than the tires on

80
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,710
a car regulate the speed of the car.

81
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,810
The thing that regulates the size of fat
cells is the brain. So let's talk about,

82
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,990
um, first of all, give you a little
framework for thinking about this.

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,730
The brain evolved over about 600 million
years to promote the survival and

84
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,290
reproduction of our ancestors.

85
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,010
And over the course of that time we
evolved all of these different brain

86
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,990
circuits that have specialized functions.

87
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,180
They generate our hunger and our
cravings and our fullness feelings.

88
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:28,210
They generate our eating behavior,
what and how much we eat.

89
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,750
And they actively regulate the
amount of fat on our bodies.

90
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,310
And that's one of the
things I want to talk about.

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,050
And all of these circuits evolved.
And these are nonconscious by the way.

92
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,880
So you don't decide.
You want to be hunger,

93
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,100
you don't decide that you
want to have a craving.

94
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,760
These are things that bubble up from
nonconscious parts of your brain that you

95
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:48,700
don't control. So, um,

96
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,660
these circuits are calibrated to
an environment of our ancestors,

97
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:57,680
not the environment where
we're living in right now.

98
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,370
So these circuits all evolved to function
optimally in the environment of our

99
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:05,600
ancestors, promote the survival
and reproduction of our ancestors.

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,640
So,
um,

101
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,750
what happens when you put these brain
circuits in the modern environment where

102
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:15,380
you have abundant calorie,
dense, tasty foods,

103
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,620
rich and carbohydrate and fat is these
same brain circuits push us to over

104
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:23,480
consume and they push our bodies
to accumulate and hold onto fat.

105
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,890
And then what you see as a result
is the three hallmarks of obesity.

106
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,290
First of all, the obvious, you see
elevated body fat mass. Second of all,

107
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,330
you see elevated calorie intake.

108
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,950
People with obesity consume more calories
than people who do not have obesity

109
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:44,510
after correcting for height and
sex and physical activity level.

110
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,651
And third,

111
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:50,330
you see that people with obesity defend
their higher level of body fatness

112
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,250
against changes. And so there's actually
a regulatory change that happens.

113
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,410
It's not conscious defense,
you know,

114
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:00,890
they're not trying to remain obese.

115
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,630
It's these body fat regulatory circuits.
And this is where Gary gets it right,

116
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,730
is that people with obesity are not
just lean. People who eat more calories.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,470
There's actually a change
in the regulatory activity
that regulates body fat in

118
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:17,780
the body.
And we can get back to how that happens.

119
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:22,040
But I'll just leave it there for now.
So up until this point,

120
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,880
I've basically just been telling
a plausible story, right? I mean,

121
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:29,360
I haven't actually cited any
evidence yet to support that.

122
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,840
My story is correct. Um,
and so let's get into that.

123
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,990
Let's talk about what some of the evidence
is that supports this idea that I've

124
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:39,740
just laid out. So I
want to start with, um,

125
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,760
the genetics of obesity.
I think this offers some wait,

126
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,370
can I interrupt for one second?
Uh, as long as it's very brief,

127
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:50,430
the question I don't, I still don't
quite understand what the model is. Okay.

128
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,890
This regulation,
if you don't understand the model,

129
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,150
how about I lay out,

130
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,960
how about I finish laying it out and
then you can ask a question because I may

131
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:03,140
answer your question over the
course of a continuing. So let me,

132
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:05,300
let me just finish. Um, okay.

133
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:10,301
So now the genetics of obesity offers
us a lot of insight into the biological

134
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:16,790
mechanisms that drive differences in
body fatness in the general population.

135
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,910
So you get these studies,
like the,

136
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,640
the most interesting studies are
the genome wide association studies.

137
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,140
They get hundreds of thousands
of people together and they, um,

138
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,200
sequence or they,

139
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,500
they measure all these markers in their
genomes and they figure out what parts

140
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:35,690
of the genome makes some
people fatter than another.

141
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:39,110
So if you have version a in
this particular location,

142
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,570
you end up a little fatter
than if you have version B.

143
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,390
And when you look at all the
places where this is happening,

144
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,840
you can see the genes where it's
happening in. And that tells you,

145
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:49,640
if you look at what those genes are doing,

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,560
that tells you what the mechanisms are
that underlie every day differences in

147
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:58,860
body, in the general population.
And so to kind of warm ourselves up,

148
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,560
let's start by talking about height genes.

149
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:04,410
So height has a strong genetic component,

150
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:09,390
so it was body fatness and researchers
has figured out a lot of the genes that

151
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,610
underlie differences in
height between people.

152
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,340
And when you look at what those genes do,

153
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,510
they tend to be involved in the growth
and development of the skeleton and the

154
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,970
connective tissue, which is
what you would expect, right?

155
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,920
Cause growth of the skeleton
determines your height.

156
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,730
So genes that determine diabetes risk
type two diabetes are all about insulin

157
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:30,270
sensitivity,

158
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:35,271
all about insulin secretion
and the function of the
insulin secreting pancreas,

159
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:41,550
which is what you expect because
diabetes is a disease that is all about

160
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:46,050
insulin. So these studies are really good
at getting at the underlying biological

161
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:48,780
mechanisms that are
driving these phenomena.

162
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,780
So what do these studies
have to say about obesity?

163
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,180
If Gary's model is correct,

164
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:58,770
we should see a bunch of genes popping
up related to fat cells and insulin.

165
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,020
If my model is correct,

166
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,190
we should see a bunch of genes popping
up related to the brain. And in fact,

167
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,540
that's exactly what we see.

168
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,340
The genetics of obesity are overwhelmingly
related to differences in brain

169
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:16,020
activity between individuals and um,
okay,

170
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:19,110
so that's one piece of evidence.
Another piece of evidence.

171
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,950
There are five FDA
approved weight loss drugs.

172
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,590
Four of those act in the brain.

173
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,120
One of them reduces dietary fat
absorption in the digestive tract.

174
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,970
There are no effective fat loss drugs
and I'm aware of the target insulin and

175
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:39,480
fat cells. Third piece of
evidence. Um, if you look at,

176
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,050
some people get really unlucky in life
and they end up with these horrible

177
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:46,920
genetic mutations that, you know,
knock out some biological pathways.

178
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,950
Some of these people end up with
extreme obesity people and also animals.

179
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,570
We see this in mice and rats.

180
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,480
Just occasionally you get unlucky
and you get really, really fat.

181
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,170
And researchers have been cataloguing.
What are these mutations?

182
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:03,690
When we find people who are
genetically really obese,

183
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,450
what are these mutations
that are making them fat?

184
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,590
What is the biological mechanism that's
getting screwed up that's making them

185
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,310
fat?

186
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,180
And what they've found is that all of
these mutations that they've identified to

187
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:15,571
date,

188
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:20,571
a number of them are occurring
in the Leptin signaling pathway.

189
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,320
And this is the Leptin,
um,

190
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,070
is the primary fat regulating
hormone in the body.

191
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,040
Gary avoids this,
never talks about this in his writing,

192
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:36,090
but Leptin is the primary fat
regulating hormone in the body.

193
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,940
And these mutations
either knock out Leptin,

194
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,140
they knock out leptin receptors or they
knock out the left and response pathway

195
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:47,760
in the brain. And um, so that's
the third piece of evidence.

196
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,683
Okay.

197
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,410
So now we haven't really gotten around
to talking about what it exactly about

198
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,770
the bad interaction that happens between
our ancient brains and the modern food

199
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:02,560
environment that causes us to become fat.
Um,

200
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,530
we've established that the
brain is central to obesity,

201
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:08,920
but we haven't really established what
it is exactly about that interaction.

202
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,810
Why does our modern food, why does our
modern environment promote obesity?

203
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:18,100
Right?
So I'm basically,

204
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,280
there are three different ways that
I'm going to look at this from,

205
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,370
um,
but first I want to say that the,

206
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,570
probably the best way to answer this
question is to start with the question,

207
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:33,700
what is the most fattening
diet in the world?

208
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,940
What is the Diet that is more
fattening than any others?

209
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:41,941
And the answer to that is it's human junk
food in a variety of non human species

210
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,840
and humans. It's human junk food that
is more fattening than any others.

211
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:50,830
And I'm going to skip over some of the
research here, um, that demonstrates this.

212
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,520
By the way, I haven't been
calling out numbers here. Okay.

213
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,160
Let me call out some numbers.
Um,

214
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,320
reference number two on my website is,
um,

215
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,240
those genetic studies.

216
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,290
Reference number one is the obesity drugs.

217
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,180
Reference number six is those
spontaneously occurring genetic mutations?

218
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,650
And now I'm talking about reference
number 52. So I'm, I'm gonna,

219
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,860
I'm gonna Gloss over some
of the individual research
cause I'm being long winded

220
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,150
here.
But um,

221
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,070
essentially what you find is that this
stuff is really fattening and animals,

222
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,210
many different species. It's super
fattening and humans calorie dense.

223
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,220
When you put create an environment
with abundant easy calorie, dense,

224
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,580
tasty foods,
rich carbs and fat,

225
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:45,030
you see this dramatic overconsumption in
fact game across many species including

226
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:45,880
humans.

227
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,880
And what you find in the research is that
the sugar and the carbohydrate cannot

228
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:56,770
explain that they're part of the
effect. Yes, they explained part of it.

229
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,810
But you cannot replicate that effect
by only feeding sugar and carbohydrate.

230
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:05,350
You can't replicate it in animals.
You can't replicate it in humans.

231
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,290
When you say you can't replicate it,
you mean you can't replicate obesity?

232
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,870
What do you mean? Yeah. Um,
that's right. You cannot,

233
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,700
you cannot cause the
same degree of fat gain,

234
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,560
the same extent of fat gain,

235
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,270
the same extent of overconsumption using
only sugar and carbohydrate that you

236
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:25,780
can cause with a variety of calorie dense,

237
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:30,700
palatable human foods. You can't fully
replicate it with sugar and carbs.

238
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,880
You cannot fully replicate
it with fat alone either.

239
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,030
If you put those when we can,
we can get deeper in this if you want,

240
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,240
but I'm confused. So you're,
you're saying that the,

241
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:44,350
the Diet that causes the most
obesity is what we think, right?

242
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:48,910
This a human junk food diet in
sugar, simple carbs, bullshit,

243
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,830
bullshit diet, right. What do you,

244
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,450
you're saying that you can't replicate
that with just your arms slowly

245
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,650
replicated fully and so it's,
what I mean is that if you just feed,

246
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,930
if you just increase sugar
intake in animals or in humans,

247
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,790
you do get weight gain,

248
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,240
but it is modest compared to what you
get when you put people around a variety

249
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:17,060
of calorie dense, palatable foods,
rich and carbohydrate and fat.

250
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,980
Similarly, if you, that's
very confusing. How's that?

251
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,880
Because I'm not sure exactly what
you're saying. You're saying you,

252
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,910
if you give people this calorie
rich sugar diet of junk food,

253
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,610
you will make them gain weight
but not as much weight as what?

254
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,050
Um,
so what I'm saying is that if you,

255
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,590
if you give people or animals the,

256
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,180
the actual human junk food with all
the carbs and fat and everything,

257
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,690
they gain a lot more weight and a lot
faster than if you just give them a diet

258
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,430
that's high in sugar and
high in refined carbohydrate.

259
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,020
And what that shows is that the sugar and
they're fine carbohydrate cannot fully

260
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:07,100
explain the effect. Can't fully
explain why those foods are fattening.

261
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,740
See this is where I'm confused. No, I
don't see what you're saying cause you're,

262
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:13,880
you're saying if you give people
the Diet of American junk food,

263
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,770
you,

264
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,770
you get not as much of an effect if
you give them just the sugar and the

265
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,270
carbohydrates, you're saying? Yep. So,

266
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:26,420
but what are you giving them when you're
giving them the, the Diet of junk food,

267
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:28,220
you give her a 10 for example,

268
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,090
in animals now it's different because
if you think about human junk foods,

269
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,740
generally those foods contain fat and
carbohydrate and salt and all kinds of

270
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:40,180
other things. So it's more,
it's more than just let's a lot,

271
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,110
so carbs and sugar.
So I'll get in more detail.

272
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:48,920
So the ways that you can do this,
you can add sugar,

273
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,420
just sugar table sugar to the feed
of animals. That's one way to do it.

274
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:57,050
Or you can add it to their drinking water.
Sometimes it's a little bit fattening,

275
00:16:57,051 --> 00:17:01,820
sometimes it's not. It's not that
fattening and animals and humans,

276
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,350
you can ask them to drink sugar sweetened
beverages that are just sugar and you

277
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:10,010
can see what happens and people will
gain weight or you can tell them to stop

278
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:12,650
drinking sugar sweetened beverages
and you can see what happens. Okay.

279
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,120
People will gain weight,

280
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,260
they will lose weight suggesting
that that is part of the explanation,

281
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,620
but it's a much smaller effect than you
see with this full pallet of these foods

282
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:28,700
that contain carbs and fat and all this
other stuff that you're saying car.

283
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,560
Well obviously there's more calories,
right?

284
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:33,320
If there's carbs and fat and
all these other, correct.

285
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,940
If you think that calories matter, then
we agree. Oh, for short matters, right?

286
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,420
Gary doesn't think it matters. You don't
think it matters. Well, let me think.

287
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:42,990
It's the wrong way to think about it.
What,

288
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,700
what do you disagree if anything
with what he said so far? Well,

289
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,040
so far what he said,
it hasn't been particularly

290
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,280
revenue. Latori um, the, uh,

291
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,700
I think we have to step back
for a second because you know,

292
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:04,020
while the low carb community might have
a more better understanding of where we

293
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,640
disagree,
um,

294
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:10,641
I think the greater community that Joe
Reaches might not so fundamentally with

295
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,840
Stefan saying and what the research
community saying and the conventional

296
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:18,750
thinking in this field is that the brain,

297
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,890
and correct me any point I get this wrong,
but the brain regulates,

298
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,340
does the fundamental job of controlling
how fast we are and the way it does it

299
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,560
is by controlling or miss controlling
our intake and our expenditure and the

300
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:37,170
different tents up in fat tissue.

301
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:40,920
Is that fair to say for the most
primarily intake but yet, yeah.

302
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,950
So Stefan has a brain centric view of
the universe and the car community at

303
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:50,670
large does as well. So if we go
outside and we walked down, you know,

304
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,080
Ventura Boulevard and we see
someone who weighs 400 pounds,

305
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,713
um,

306
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,560
they've clearly taken in more calories
than they should have over the course of

307
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:04,830
their life.
And it's been stored in their fat tissue.

308
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,660
And Stefan says,

309
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,690
I think would say that the problem is in
their brains ability to regulate intake

310
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:16,560
to expenditure. Is that
correct? Yeah. Okay.

311
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,480
And let me, I have to fix my headphones.
So how are we going to do this?

312
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:26,220
I'm getting feedback when I talk. You
getting feedback? Yeah, it's just weird.

313
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:27,510
It could be the,
hold on one sec.

314
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,080
For those who don't know,
I'm hearing impaired as they say kindly.

315
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,100
My kids would say deaf as a post,

316
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,160
so I took off my hearing aids
and it's a little better. Okay.

317
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,830
So what I've been arguing, so I come
along my background, I'm a journalist,

318
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:51,450
I'm an investigative journalist
with a science background.
Okay. That's what I do.

319
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:55,460
And I'm curious and I've got
a lot of, you know, and I,

320
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,730
my first two books were studying
what's called pathological science,

321
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,700
which is about people who've got the
wrong results in science because a lot of

322
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,590
times scientists do so by,
I'm very sensitive to this.

323
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,070
And as I was doing the
research for my first book,

324
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:12,960
which took five years,

325
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,560
what I noticed in when you
take a historical perspective
is that the research

326
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:23,400
community studying obesity
was very focused on the brain.

327
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,520
They just assume that that people are
gluttons and I'm going to use some

328
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:31,020
socially unacceptable, uh,
language because in part
that's how they thought about.

329
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:35,520
And in fact, when you read
the, uh, obesity literature
from the forties and 50s,

330
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:39,420
it's shocking the way these people
talked about people with obesity.

331
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,150
And the assumption was
that they're gluttons are,

332
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:45,130
they're neurotic or they're anxious
or they're just, you know, but,

333
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,060
but it was all brain center.
And when they go out to the 1960s,

334
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,480
the field was being run by psychologists
and psychiatrists who are trying to get

335
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,050
people with obesity eat less.
And it,

336
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,110
my favorite example is one team
that was trying to get they,

337
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,680
they got the wives to stop having sex
with the husband if they didn't lose

338
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:05,650
weight every week.
And now with motivate them,

339
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:09,280
I think even you point out that sex
is a greater motivator in your book.

340
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,140
Then tasty foods.

341
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,510
It didn't say it was greater but I
said it was on par or on par. So,

342
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,660
and I'm going to just read you a,
I won't read you that the,

343
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:27,520
so there was this, while the
obesity research community
is focusing on the brain,

344
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,900
there were people studying fat
metabolism and an endocrinologist.

345
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,710
They studied hormones and hormone related
disorders saying that the oh you know,

346
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,520
fat storage and fat mobilization,

347
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:41,800
the burning of fat and the human body is

348
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,580
controlled by this very diverse set of
hormones and enzymes and the nervous

349
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:52,840
system is involved in well and our body
does a very careful job of deciding

350
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,170
basically orchestrating how
we use fields after we eat.

351
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,320
And the implication was,

352
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,000
and I think Stefan kind of stepped into
this with the very first thing you said.

353
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:07,750
So the assumption was obesity is a
disorder of excess fat accumulation.

354
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,150
So today when you read the literature,
the articles we'll opposite.

355
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,510
Obesity is a sort of energy imbalance.

356
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,760
You take in more calories
than they expend.

357
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,480
There were still the best
scientists in the field,

358
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:22,100
the best physician scientist
with they look obesity,

359
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,130
a sort of excess fat accumulation. Let's
look at what regulates fat accumulation.

360
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:28,060
The human body.

361
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,390
Some people are programmed or dysregulated
to store more fat and if the store

362
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:36,940
more fat, they're going to, their
behavior is going to respond,

363
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:39,940
they'll be hungry or they'll eat more,
there'll be gluttons, all these things.

364
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,240
So it was a switching the causality
instead of the brain determining energy

365
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:48,550
balance and that determining
fat accumulation.

366
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,780
The idea was sort of, let's see,
what regulates fat accumulation.

367
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:56,650
If that's dysregulated,
if I have a,

368
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,270
if I give birth to a daughter who weighs
a hundred pounds at age four I'm not

369
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:03,610
going to worry about how
much he eats and exercises.

370
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,590
I'm going to worry about what's going
on with fat accumulation and this young

371
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:12,730
girl that her body is just
as if you give a, you know,

372
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,360
if you have a child who's six foot
eight when he was six years old,

373
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,840
you're not going to worry about
how much he eats an exercises.

374
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,130
You're going to worry that he's over
secreting growth hormone. So the idea,

375
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,750
basically what I've done,
my role in this is to say look

376
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,550
in this vitally important period in the
1960s and 1970s when obesity researchers

377
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:38,170
came to understand fat
metabolism researchers came
to understand that regulation

378
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:39,070
of fat cells,

379
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,450
the obesity people were convinced
that the problem was in the brain.

380
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,960
And those obesity people eventually grew
into the world that Stefan got his PhD

381
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,370
in neuro biological world where you study
what's happening in the brain and you

382
00:23:55,371 --> 00:24:00,371
ignore what's happening in the fat cells
and fat mobilization and fatty acid

383
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:04,520
oxidation and tad Stuart.
And when you look at that,

384
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,870
you find a whole world of places in
which people can pre be predetermined,

385
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,780
you know, be driven to
be fat. So, for example,

386
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,980
when I was in high school,
senior year in high school,

387
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:23,981
I weighed 195 pounds and I played
football and my brother two years older,

388
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,180
weight 195 pounds his senior
year and played football.

389
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,200
My brother never got more than 195
pounds and I went up to two 40.

390
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:38,240
We both ate as much as humanly possible.
You know, as you could imagine,

391
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,110
that's what high school athletes do.
My brother was always a lien.

392
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,600
I was always chubby. My brother stayed
lean and became an endurance athlete.

393
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:49,910
I became a football player
and I lifted weights.

394
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:54,170
I put on muscle easily and I
fattened easily. He didn't.

395
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,030
Um,

396
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,980
the conventional wisdom
would be the reason I went
to two 40 and he never got to

397
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:03,200
one 95 was that my brain
was different than his.

398
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,340
My argument is our bodies
were fundamentally different.

399
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,370
So if I see somebody walking down
the street or weighs 300 pounds,

400
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:11,210
I don't worry about,

401
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,110
I don't think about what the problem
is with her brain regulating intake and

402
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,630
expenditure.
I think about what's,

403
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:21,620
why is her body driving her to be
300 pounds? So that's, I think,

404
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,590
kind of the fundamental
difference. Um, and is it,

405
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,260
is it the brain that can't do the job
or is it the body that can't do the job

406
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:33,170
and the brain is responding to
what's happening in the body?

407
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,640
Yeah. Is this a reductionist perspective?
Cause I mean, isn't it a holistic,

408
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:41,660
I mean holistically you're looking at
the entire machine of the human body.

409
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,040
The idea that the brain is somehow or
another separate from the body is saying

410
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:47,180
it's separate.
The question is,

411
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:51,400
is a brain driving what's happening in
the body or is it responding to whatever?

412
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,120
Um,
and you know,

413
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:56,810
the brain of course does respond a lot
to what's happening in the body and we

414
00:25:56,811 --> 00:26:01,490
can talk about that and how that
works. Um, but you know, I think it's,

415
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,310
we can tell stories,
but the things,

416
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:09,050
the thing that differentiates a story
that's true from a story that is not true

417
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,420
is evidence. And so, you know,

418
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:13,820
you talk about the difference
between your brother and you.

419
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,810
This is where that genetics evidence comes
back in that I was talking about your

420
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:20,330
brother and you only
share half of your genes.

421
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,870
We know that genetics has a strong impact
on who has a greater susceptibility to

422
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,910
body fatness and not than others.

423
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,340
And we also know what the genes do that
underlie those differences and they are

424
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,330
primary. I'm not done Gary, let me
finish those genes. Those genes. Nope.

425
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,850
Nope, not right now. I'm in
the middle of saying something.

426
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,350
Those genes are primarily related
to differences in brain function.

427
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,150
That is what the genetic say.

428
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:53,330
And so that suggests that the reason why
you had a greater propensity than your

429
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:58,710
brother to become fat probably has to
do with differences in genetics that

430
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,160
relate to brain function. That
is what the research says. Okay,

431
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,980
very actually look when you talked
about two 17 year olds that way,

432
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:10,320
exactly the same amount. Like how do we
know how much they consumed in calories?

433
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:11,920
I mean, we don't have any
studies. We don't have any,

434
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,170
I mean I can guarantee you we both paid
as much as humanly possible. Right?

435
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:19,860
But I'm actually my brother who never
got over one 95 and I apologize for

436
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:21,120
bringing you up on the air.

437
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,020
I know you don't like that used
to say that he never gets stuffed.

438
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,820
He just gets bored of eating after
a couple of hours. Okay, okay.

439
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:33,930
But I mean that'd be even though like
maybe if you looked at it scientifically,

440
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:37,980
you ate more than him or maybe
you ate more sugar, more carbs.

441
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,020
So that's a difference. So the, those
are the two hypothesis. One hypothesis is

442
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,900
my body and this is what Stefan is
talking about. So I want to just,

443
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:51,090
the thing I wanted to read, how
much, I'll ask you the question,

444
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:55,680
how much of the variation in human
obesity to those genes explain?

445
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,570
So if you look at the genetics of that,
I didn't ask how much

446
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,310
let's talking. Yeah, you
got to look to please Gary.

447
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,790
So if you look at the genetics of obesity,

448
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,560
what you find is that from twin studies
and family studies that measure the

449
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,660
overall contribution of genetics,

450
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,110
about 75% of the differences in body
fatness between individuals is due to

451
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:25,500
genetic differences between
those individuals. So, you know,

452
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,080
1995 America,

453
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:32,400
if you just take a cross section of
people and you measure how much is genes,

454
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:35,850
how much is environment,
about 75% is genetic.

455
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Now we've only identified
a small proportion of the
specific genes that underlie

456
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,950
the propensity to obesity.

457
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,660
And so if you look at the percentage
that we have specifically identified,

458
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:52,890
it's a very small, and that's what I
refer to in my book. How much it's like a,

459
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,450
right now I think it's up to about 10%
it was 3% when your book was published.

460
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,590
That's correct. And they
did 7% absolutely. Yeah.
The latest. Yeah. Actually,

461
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:05,310
let me cite the, uh, so while
the study, they're just a second,

462
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:08,750
I'm going to cite this study just a
second. I'm gonna cite this study. Uh,

463
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,110
this study is under reference number two.

464
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,000
So you can,
you can go check that out.

465
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:18,840
It's about 10% and these genetic
studies are advancing very quickly.

466
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,180
And that's why in the three
years since I wrote that,

467
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,230
we have explained a lot more than we
did at the time that I wrote that.

468
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,700
And so we have a portion of these genes
identified and what we're seeing is that

469
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:34,680
most of that portion that we have
identified relate to brain activity.

470
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:39,660
And so that tells us that primarily the
differences between individuals that

471
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:42,220
determined differences in body.
And this is about

472
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,160
differences in brain activity.
And no one should be shocked about this.

473
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,700
The brain generates all
of our eating behavior.

474
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,110
It generates all of our physical activity
behavior and it actually regulates

475
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:57,490
body fatness. No one should
be surprised by this. I am.

476
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,710
And I was.
And how were you surprised you again?

477
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,290
Now if you disagree with virtually
everything, but, um, let's begin with

478
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,370
track back now. The um, okay,

479
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:15,940
so drugs that explain obesity 10% with
the argument that I was making and the

480
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:20,430
argument I continued to make. Imagine
if you don't, we'll take Stefan's,

481
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,390
uh, car medicine's Stefan.
He says, Steph. Okay.

482
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,170
It's okay. I'm not saying that, but I
mean that people don't get confused.

483
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,220
Thank you.
The,

484
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:36,080
if you take Stephan's car analogy
and somewhere in the 1970s, I,

485
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:39,610
I've used the car analogy for this too,
but I don't think it's as appropriate.

486
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,680
But one way to think that
somewhere in the 1970s,

487
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,110
the aliens didn't notice that
there were humans driving the car.

488
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:52,980
So now they're trying to solve the
problem without the humans involved. Well,

489
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:56,440
I see some cars drive faster than others
and they come up with all kinds of

490
00:30:56,441 --> 00:31:00,910
hypotheses and some of them can
explain it even when they interpret the

491
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:01,691
hypotheses.

492
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:05,770
One of the common problems and science
has called intellectual face lock.

493
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:11,370
So what I've been arguing is in effect
the obesity research community left out

494
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,030
of its research,
1960s era endocrinology,

495
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,680
the hormonal metabolic regulation
of fatty acid metabolism,

496
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:25,270
oxidation burning.
And it sucks when they did it.

497
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,540
Pretty much everything they've done
since has been interpreted incorrectly.

498
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,950
Just like the aliens would interpret
the car problem if they never notice the

499
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:38,020
humans. So, um, and
Leptin is a good example.

500
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,460
So Leptin is discovered in 1993
and when Leptin is discovered,

501
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:46,180
obesity becomes sort of a legitimate
field of science. Until then,

502
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:50,350
it's a bunch of actually
mostly psychologists studying
it and now it becomes a

503
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,460
subdiscipline and molecular biology and
all the molecular just jump into the

504
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:57,160
field and they assume that would let them,
does,

505
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:02,170
is controlled the brain signals how
much fat is available to some kind of

506
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:08,371
satiety or field efficiency
[inaudible] hormone.

507
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,600
And as such,

508
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,040
they studied the brain and they studied
the action of Lipton in the brain.

509
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,780
Now in 2002,

510
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:21,781
Jeff Friedman who gets credit for
discovering Leptin perhaps incorrectly,

511
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,660
um,
publishes a paper in the journal Science.

512
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:29,950
It's saying perhaps as much as two thirds
or more of what Leptin does is done in

513
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:32,950
the periphery in the body.
And what Leptin does,

514
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,080
it's a hormone that sort of is,

515
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,560
is secreted in response to how
much fat you've accumulated.

516
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,850
And then does it stimulate the brain to
tell you to eat more or less depending

517
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:47,150
on how much fat or it
also works in liver cells,

518
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:48,710
which are the cells that were studying.

519
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,630
And the assumption is it probably doesn't
all cells to tell yourselves to burn

520
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:54,464
fat.

521
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,100
So it makes perfect sense if there's fat
available in the fat cell is now you've

522
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:02,930
got a signal telling sort of influencing
the other cells of the body to burn fat.

523
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,670
So now you've got a hormone that
could work in the periphery, in the,

524
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,490
in the below then neck or it
could work above the neck.

525
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:14,030
But you've got a community that to
almost exclusively studying in the head.

526
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:18,170
They don't know they're a human drivers
down here. So that's what they do.

527
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,870
So even in this world,
the, the I, I don't,

528
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,900
I think I know the genome paper I'm
Stefan is probably referenced on,

529
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:34,940
that's the reason. Is it
the, I don't remember the,

530
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:39,350
so they had two papers cause it's what
you cited in the article you coauthored

531
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,510
with Rudy Leibel.
So I have two papers.

532
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,930
One is genes associated with obesity and
one is genes associated with body type.

533
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,210
So with body type, they're all below
the neck. They're all, you know,

534
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,040
fat metabolism basically.
And the Musk,

535
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,050
the genes at aspects of your body that
you would expect to be controlled.

536
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:04,670
Like when you build up muscle and you
have to take an excess energy to do it.

537
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:05,361
It makes you hungry.

538
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:08,930
I don't think your brain is regulating
how much muscle you're building other

539
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:10,910
than your drive to go to the gym.

540
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,320
Basically your body is responding
to the stress on the muscle,

541
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:18,530
all the things you do and the
weightlifting. It's all below the neck.

542
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,990
So the argument here is again simple.

543
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,650
When these people looked at body type,

544
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,110
it was insulin regulated
genes for the most part,

545
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:33,620
growth hormone, all of these things.
When they looked at excess body fat,

546
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,330
they decided they were in the head.

547
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,920
But the question is when they looked their
program to think that excess body fat,

548
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:42,320
it's caused by overeating.
So they look in the brain.

549
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,840
Did they do the same kind and I was
going to call the researcher involved.

550
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:47,120
I never got around to doing it.

551
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:52,630
Saying if body type body
shape is determined by these
genes and it doesn't make

552
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:59,120
sense that x has variations of body shape,

553
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:01,010
we're going to be determined
by the same genes.

554
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,500
And did you just do the
same kind of searches?

555
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,500
I don't actually know how they
determine where the genes work.

556
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,010
It's the same kind of searches. They just
came up with different sets of genes.

557
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,350
So they didn't start with any assumptions.

558
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:15,470
They were just finding the
questionnaire where the genes work.

559
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:18,500
So there's a common phenomenon.
All this like with Leptin,

560
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,730
a gene that everybody thinks about working
in the hypothalamus seems to work and

561
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:26,590
everything. Can I respond to that
talking cause you say this in your head,

562
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,620
you say this in your book. Go ahead. I'm
prepared to respond whenever you're done.

563
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,730
Okay. In your book you say that gene's
work you, the body is very, basically,

564
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:40,490
it puts a different mechanisms
to work as many places that can.

565
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:44,430
And there these homeostatic feedback
loops, you know, something happens.

566
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:46,140
Your whole body has to respond.

567
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:51,390
So a gene that my work primarily on
one cell is scattered all over the body

568
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:54,270
because every cell, and it'll do
different jobs on different cells.

569
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,740
But if you think that the problems
in the brain, that's where you look,

570
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,980
you said you get this kind of intellectual
phase lock where that's what we do.

571
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:09,000
That's what we study. And
neurobiologists studies the brain. Uh,

572
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,290
uh,
Daniel Conaman,

573
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:15,360
I just stepped in like suicide Daniel
Economy and as well had this concept.

574
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,320
What you see is all, he's a Nobel
laureate, uh, cognitive psychologists.

575
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,590
What you see is all there is.
Okay.

576
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,720
And basically if you're
studying the brain,

577
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,750
that's what you look at if you're studying
the gun until we all get trapped into

578
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:34,110
that on some extent. And what I'm
saying is, even in these studies,

579
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,330
so Stefan,

580
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,370
Stefan wrote a book about the hungry brain
that is supposed to be about obesity,

581
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,421
but in fact,

582
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:47,120
you never mentioned anything about the
metabolic regulation of fat accumulation.

583
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,150
It's just not there.

584
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,460
And I would argue it has to be there.

585
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:57,450
Even if it's wrong, if it's
not there, the absence of it.

586
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,900
Like you can't talk about Leptin without
talking about what it might be doing in

587
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:05,190
the body. You can talk, you
know, so there's a the end,

588
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:07,050
it's put me in a very odd position.

589
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,860
So Stephan is kind of the defender of
the Orthodox and I'm the one who comes

590
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:15,450
along and says, look, you guys
just, you missed it. You screwed up.

591
00:37:15,451 --> 00:37:18,360
You had psychologists and psychiatrists
running the field when the

592
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,390
endocrinologist sob that and then
you discovered Leptin and it became a

593
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:25,920
molecular biology problem and you're
now divorced from the very simplest

594
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:29,190
observations about obesity.
You know,

595
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,610
so we can do huge genome
wide association studies.

596
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:34,650
A sound remarkable.

597
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:40,290
But if I were to ask a simple question
like why is it I get fat here?

598
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,060
Yeah, the love handle thing, it's in the
back with man. It's not in the front,

599
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:48,030
but it's here and not here.

600
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,440
I don't see what the brain has
to say about that. Um, okay. So,

601
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,060
as you mentioned,

602
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,960
there have been different genetic
studies that have looked at body fat

603
00:37:57,961 --> 00:38:02,300
distribution versus total body fatness.
So total body fat,

604
00:38:02,301 --> 00:38:06,000
and this is what we're talking about
when we're talking about obesity. Uh,

605
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,660
body fat distribution is what we're
talking about when we're talking about the

606
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,850
fat being on your hips
versus on your wrist.

607
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,240
Now what we see is different
sets of genes that come up.

608
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:19,020
So body fat distribution,
we actually see insulin,

609
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,640
a related genes, so people that have
a central body fat distribution,

610
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:28,641
so body fat around their waist tend to
have these insulin related genes that are

611
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:32,160
driving that.
But when you look at total body fatness,

612
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,070
the thing that causes obesity,
what you see is that those genes

613
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,230
are dominated by the brain.
And the really cool thing,

614
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,850
the point I want to make
about the genetics research
10% is that it seems might

615
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:46,360
be dominated by the brain
if say, look, come on Gary.

616
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:51,400
It is unbiased. That's the really cool
thing about it is that they're just,

617
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,650
this is whatever genes are popping up.

618
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,700
These studies do not care about what
you believe about what causes obesity.

619
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:59,590
This is just whatever
genes are popping up.

620
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:04,060
So it's unbiased and that's what they're
saying and I'm not done here. Gary.

621
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,230
Now I want to talk about,
um, you mentioned Gary,

622
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,040
that maybe Leptin is
having important actions,

623
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,370
not just in the brain but in the
body. First of all, I'm glad,

624
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,580
I'm flattered that you read my book
and I'm glad that you acknowledge the

625
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,910
existence of Leptin. Now this is good. Um,

626
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:27,450
but now you say that researchers focus
on Leptin actions in the brain because

627
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:32,350
we're phase locked and we
can't get out of our, you know,

628
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,940
blinders of thinking about it in terms
of the brain and that that's why we focus

629
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,710
on left an action in the brain.

630
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,510
The real reason we focus on left in
action in the brain is because it has been

631
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:48,130
demonstrated that it's effect on body.
Fatness are via the brain.

632
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:50,500
There are actual experiments
demonstrating this,

633
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:52,660
and I'll explain how
these experiments work.

634
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,700
This is all in the scientific literature.

635
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:00,150
So if you knock out the Leptin receptor
only in the brain or only in the

636
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:04,960
Hypothalamus,
you get obesity.

637
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:10,300
So that is what tells us that actually
the brain is the key site of action.

638
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:11,790
And particularly this challenge.

639
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:16,990
It tells me Gary Key site,
please let him talk.

640
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,420
He let you talk. Yeah. And that's it.

641
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:23,860
So I mean you get the same obesity if
you knock leaped and how to the brain and

642
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:26,380
particularly out of the hypothalamus
that you get if you knock it out of the

643
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:27,214
whole body.

644
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,720
So that shows that the brain is this
site of action that is causing this to

645
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:35,380
happen. And this is no surprise. We
have these mechanisms worked out.

646
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,390
We know specific groups of neurons that
are receiving the left and that are

647
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:44,140
controlling our appetite,
that are controlling our metabolic rate.

648
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,470
We have many of these neuro
populations worked out in mice.

649
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,420
We understand these systems so well.

650
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:54,850
We can control specific popular tiny
populations of neurons very precisely.

651
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,500
Caused them to eat a ton,
to stop eating, to gain fat,

652
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,380
to lose fat like the
animals are marionettes.

653
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,130
I mean that's the level of understanding
we have right now of how these systems

654
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:06,964
work.

655
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:12,030
So I mean all of this evidence
is converging on the same
thing that the brain is

656
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:15,760
central and that fat cell metabolism,

657
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm just not seeing the
evidence for that. I mean, Gary,

658
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,520
if you want to cite specific evidence
demonstrating that that is an actual cause

659
00:41:23,591 --> 00:41:27,640
of differences in body fatness between
individuals in the general population.

660
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,900
I'm awaiting that evidence and I'm happy
to sit here and listen to you cite the

661
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:36,170
evidence that demonstrates. Can I, can I
pause here and Leptin is produced where?

662
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,170
Yeah, Leptin is produced. Yeah.
Let's talk about Leptin a little bit.

663
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:44,171
It's produced in fat cells and it's
produced in proportion to the size of fat

664
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:48,230
tissue. So the amount of body fat
you have, the more fat you have,

665
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:52,070
the more Leptin you have in the
circulation. And basically what this is,

666
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,590
it's what's called a
negative feedback loop,

667
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:59,210
which is a really simple engineering
term that works like a thermostat.

668
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,000
So with your Thermostat,
you uh,

669
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:07,220
if you set your thermostat to 70, if it
starts getting a little bit of hotter,

670
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,760
your ac turns on to bring it back
down at the starts getting lower,

671
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,910
ac comes on or the heat
comes on to bring it up.

672
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:18,650
That's called a negative feedback system
and it maintains the stability of the

673
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:19,910
temperature of your house.

674
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,920
We have many negative feedback loops
in the human body to regulate body

675
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:28,370
temperature, to regulate blood pressure,
to regulate all sorts of things.

676
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,530
One of the negative feedback loops we
have regulates body fatness and the

677
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:38,300
hormones. So your, your
thermostat measures temperature
by using a thermostat,

678
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,850
a Saria,
a thermometer,

679
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,990
your brain measures body fatness using
this hormone leptin that's in the

680
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:49,520
circulation. And then particularly
when your body fat level drops,

681
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,890
your Leptin levels drop and your brain
hears that and it kicks in a starvation

682
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:56,000
response basically.

683
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,600
And this is the main reason why weight
loss is so difficult because your brain

684
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:03,980
is like, no, I don't want to be
losing fat. And it makes you hungrier.

685
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:08,330
It increases your cravings. Yes. Is that
a certain level of body fat as a sub.

686
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,330
So here's this, just when you're
losing body fat in general,

687
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:13,790
like even if you're a large
person that's overweight, correct.

688
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,110
When you're losing body fat in general,
your body, it exacerbates your hunger.

689
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,741
And this is,

690
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:23,210
this is the thing that's really important
to understand about obesity is that

691
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,210
people with obesity
have a higher set point.

692
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:30,620
So it's like turning your thermostat from
70 to 80 and then your thermostats of

693
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:33,080
regulating around 80 people with obesity,

694
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:35,390
they're not regulating
around one 70 anymore.

695
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:40,391
They're regulating around two 50 and
so when you cause a lean person to lose

696
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:41,090
weight,

697
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,630
you see the same thing is when you cause
a person with obesity to lose weight,

698
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,930
you see this reaction in their brain
circuits that regulate body fatness that

699
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:55,190
drives them to increase their cravings
and their hunger to metabolic rate drops.

700
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,000
So it'd be an evolutionary mechanism
to force you to seek food. Correct.

701
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,580
And not just the foresee to seek food.
That's the main thing.

702
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:03,590
But it also slows your metabolic rate,

703
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,770
does everything it can to
get more energy in your body.

704
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:10,640
And have less leaving and it keeps
doing that until the fat comes back.

705
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,570
Can I pause here?
Yeah.

706
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,280
So when you're eating a sugary
die at a high high calorie diet,

707
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,160
you will produce more fat. Your
body will get fatter, right? Um,

708
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,720
it depends on how many calories
you're eating. If you're overeating,

709
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:27,170
you consuming a lot of sugar, a lot of
carbohydrates, your body will get fatter.

710
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,830
So your body will produce more
Leptin. Correct. So it comes from the

711
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,640
um, yeah, indirectly,
definitely pause, please.

712
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,840
So the Leptin is produced not just in
response to the size of the fat tail,

713
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:44,841
but in response actually to glucose and
a mediated uptake into the fat cell,

714
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:48,570
which is mediated in part by insulin.
So you come back to insulin,

715
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:52,260
even with the Leptin, you raise
blood sugar and that's the carbs.

716
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:56,850
You eat the carbs, you raise blood sugar,
you raise insulin, you raise fat storage,

717
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,090
the glucose, and then you get
more leaped. And um, again,

718
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,910
one of the things you have to understand
about this is everything that's said

719
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,320
has two interpretations, depending
on which paradigm you're looking in.

720
00:45:08,321 --> 00:45:10,530
And these are fundamentally
different paradigms.

721
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,750
So in Stephen's world, and again,
correct me if I'm wrong though,

722
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:20,751
the Leptin is signaling
few all availability in the
fat cells the way I would

723
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:22,471
think of it.

724
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:27,471
And in my very small world and Leptin is
responding to fuel availability in the

725
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:29,220
rest of the cells.

726
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,450
So it's basically a molecule that
can tell other cells that there's fat

727
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:37,500
available and you could burn that fat for
fuel and then you don't have to go eat

728
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,810
or it can tell that there
isn't fuel available. And if,

729
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:46,470
depending on how much left in there is
the cells and then that what respond by a

730
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:50,800
signal to eat or not to
disinhibit eating behavior. Um,

731
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,590
everything we're talking about with Stefan
and I first sort of fell out, I dunno,

732
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,510
eight years ago at

733
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,530
ancestral health symposium when I

734
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,680
acted improperly inappropriately.
But one of the problems I had to,

735
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:11,610
the way I think you should think
about this, you have a hypothesis,

736
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,990
and this is the fundamental thing,
is it obesity caused by overeating?

737
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,300
Because we know if you're getting fatter,

738
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,120
you're storing more calories in your
expense. That's just the, you know,

739
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,280
that's like if a room is getting more
crowded, more people are entering them.

740
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,690
Leaving.
That is the simplest,

741
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,720
but it doesn't tell you why
the room's getting crowded.

742
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:34,620
It doesn't tell you why you're
getting fatter. And again,

743
00:46:34,621 --> 00:46:37,020
what I've been arguing is the
why you're getting fatter.

744
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:41,010
Part has been left out and people
decided that overeating was somehow an

745
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:44,520
explanation and then they went to the
brain to look at white people might

746
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:49,410
overeat. So what I, one of the questions
I asked to find eight years ago,

747
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:52,800
and it keeps coming up as if we're going
to blame obesity on the modern food

748
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:57,090
environment, epidemics
of obesity, you know,

749
00:46:57,091 --> 00:47:02,091
simple question to ask is can we find
epidemics of obesity without this modern

750
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:07,530
food environment? I mean, that's
the sort of science one o one right?

751
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,840
And it turns out that
the world is following.

752
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:14,841
The first one I found in the literature
was in 1902 in a population of the Pima

753
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,130
native American tribes, pm and living
in Arizona and observers saying,

754
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:24,540
these people are poor,
they're malnourished, they're
suffering through famines,

755
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,050
they've been suffering through a
famine for 40 years and famines.

756
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,860
It's hard to overeat during a famine.

757
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:35,110
And yet the women of the tribe who do
virtually all the work that they were

758
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:38,890
treated as pack animals and effect,
we're obese.

759
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,880
So now we can disassociate obesity from
the modern food environment and we could

760
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,610
disassociated from,
uh,

761
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:52,690
this ultra processed foods we eat
and start to ask the question,

762
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,130
what is it about,

763
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:58,030
can we find what might have driven
obesity in that population despite the

764
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:01,570
existence of famine?
So it's from very simple observation.

765
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:05,440
Once we get into these kinds of studies,
say this in human genome studies,

766
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:07,120
say that,
um,

767
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,970
I actually rarely do that in my books
because you can find studies that will say

768
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:17,050
anything and you'll see in the studies,
um,

769
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,810
people misinterpreting them.

770
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,050
What was the cause of the population
of women to be obese? Well.

771
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:26,110
So one of the thing that happened
during the Vint beginning in the 1860s,

772
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,610
the PMO were put on a reservoir.

773
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,650
They moved on to reds or
they were reservation eyes
whenever the verb form would

774
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:35,380
be.
And they began eating western foods.

775
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:40,120
And back then it was sugar flour and lard
for the most part and sugary beverages

776
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:43,720
probably.
So that's a reasonable hypothesis.

777
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,360
And you could find the same thing.

778
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:50,860
And the Sioux native American sue
population living on a reservation in 1928

779
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,480
where you had uh,

780
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,470
oh both obese men and women
living with malnourished,

781
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,960
stunted children who clearly
wouldn't getting enough diet,

782
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:03,250
but they were on a reservation, they
were getting western foods. So ultimately

783
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,440
the question you ask in science
determines the answer you get.

784
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:13,470
So the question I was asking is we have
this observation that any population

785
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:19,051
that transitions to western diet or
western diet and lifestyle gets obese and

786
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:23,800
diabetic, they, they develop
what's called Metabolic Syndrome,

787
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:26,560
which is insulin resistance
and all these issues.

788
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,050
And we know that's true
all over the world.

789
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:32,860
From the [inaudible] to the
Pima to south Pacific islanders,

790
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:37,180
to Africans, to European. So the
genetics aren't that important.

791
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:41,890
The question is what's triggering it
in the environment and against Stephan

792
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:42,491
would say,

793
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:47,491
well there's too much food available and
it's too palatable and we can't say no.

794
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,520
And I had a lot of problems with the,

795
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:56,260
we can say no part cause if we're lean
it means that they can't say no and they

796
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:59,590
being the people with obesity and I
don't believe that's true. And then,

797
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,400
or is it some specific item or
some specific group in this,

798
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:10,651
these foods that travel with western
populations and so the exists the ability

799
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:16,261
and today if you look up a dual
burden of obesity and malnutrition,

800
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:19,060
I have a Dropbox folder
I could share with you.

801
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:22,690
There's probably 50 studies all over
the world. You see the same observation,

802
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:26,380
incredibly poor populations,
malnourished. The children are stunted,

803
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:31,770
which they're protein deficient in their
calorie deficient and often the mothers

804
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:36,530
are, the ants are obesity. Obesity
tends to run in the females,

805
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:41,590
which suggests it has a female
sex hormone related effect.

806
00:50:41,591 --> 00:50:44,180
Fact that I don't believe works in
the brain because we're dealing with

807
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:49,181
populations that could not have overeaten
if they could have overeaten why are

808
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:50,720
the kids starving?

809
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:55,721
That's sort of the question and this was
the first thing that I think we swapped

810
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:57,590
about back then,
and it's still,

811
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:02,420
if you can find populations
with obesity epidemics,

812
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,210
but without the modern food system,

813
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:09,570
without Snackwells and without
Lay's potato chips. Um,

814
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,680
and if you know that they're going through
a famine or you know that the kids at

815
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:17,090
least aren't getting a food,

816
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:21,320
how do you explain obesity and the mothers
without assuming that the mothers are

817
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,500
overheating? Let's pause
right there. Stefan,

818
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:29,501
is there a population of people that
are obese that are not eating a western

819
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:31,370
diet?
They're not eating sugary foods,

820
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:37,410
um, that are obese and that
are not eating sugary foods?

821
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:38,580
Probably not.

822
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:43,500
Because generally once you have an
industrialized food system that's going to

823
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:44,340
include sugar,

824
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:48,990
but there are populations that eat
a lot of sugar and are not obese.

825
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:51,850
And we should talk about some of
these actual, let's, let's about the,

826
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,130
go back to the, yeah, sure. Let's
talk about the Pima first. Um,

827
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,510
now Gary has told his story.
He's told his version of the Pima story.

828
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,070
Let me tell the story,

829
00:52:02,071 --> 00:52:06,930
the version of the story that appears in
the scientific literature. Now, the Pima,

830
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:10,200
um,
originally they were agriculturalists.

831
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,790
They were eating traditionally a very
high carbohydrate diet based on unrefined

832
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:18,690
carbohydrates. Originally it
was corn, beans and squash.

833
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,700
Primarily they were hunter gatherers,
agriculture. They were primarily Gary.

834
00:52:23,701 --> 00:52:27,060
Okay. They were primarily
eating agricultural foods.

835
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:31,170
They were also collecting some
wild foods. That's correct. Um,

836
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,530
they were fishing and
eating the skeet pods.

837
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,140
Primarily agricultural and

838
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,590
data are very clear on that, Gary. So, no,
no, no. Yes, they are. Look, we have data.

839
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:46,920
You can't say things like that to happen
because we're going to die. Well, let's,

840
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,640
let's, let's move on. You think they
mostly fish? That's incorrect. Okay.

841
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:54,360
According to the data,
I remember you saying that in your book.

842
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:58,650
Something to that effect. Read Book.
You've got my book. Anyway, let's,

843
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,560
let's go on. We don't, that's fine.
I'm going to move on here. Um,

844
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:08,360
now the Pima traditionally
were agriculturalists and Wa.

845
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,180
What happened basically is you had all
these farmers moving into their area,

846
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,880
settlers of European descent,

847
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:20,050
and they diverted the water from
their river, the Gila or healer river,

848
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:24,720
if you alone for now Hilo. And so they
were no longer able to grow their crops,

849
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,840
their agricultural crops that
they were primarily dependent on.

850
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,710
And therefore the government started
providing them with foods to eat.

851
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:36,870
And these were calorie dense refined
foods. They were like Gary said, uh,

852
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,790
flour,
lard and sugar.

853
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,390
And then they became very obese.

854
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,340
Now there was a population of Pima right
across the border from them in Mexico,

855
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,010
also very similar culturally and all that,

856
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:54,630
that maintain their traditional high
carbohydrate lifestyle and agricultural

857
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,261
lifestyle.

858
00:53:55,261 --> 00:54:00,261
And there've been studies comparing
those two populations and the ones across

859
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:04,170
the border with their traditional
lifestyle or a lot leaner and healthier,

860
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,330
not surprisingly than the ones eating
lard, flour and sugar. Okay. But Gary,

861
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,660
uh, you seem to believe
that people can gain weight.

862
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:14,370
You kept referring to famines and things.

863
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:19,371
You seem to believe that people can gain
weight even if they are eating very few

864
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:23,850
calories. And you have referred to
this many times in your writing. Um,

865
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,720
and you know,

866
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:29,460
these are very casual observations
that you're making kind of these casual

867
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:31,800
correlations and storytelling.

868
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,190
But if you actually look
at the data on this,

869
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:40,191
what you see is that if you just measure
calorie intake in people who have

870
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:41,874
obesity,

871
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,120
it is 20 to 35% higher than people who
are lean after correcting for height,

872
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,810
physical activity level. Um,
and that I've got the references

873
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,130
we're getting, we're getting a
little bit into that means here,

874
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,400
but let me give you an exuberance number
seven, can I pause you guys right here?

875
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,870
These people,
they have essentially the same lineage.

876
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,850
One group lives in Mexico.
They,

877
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:10,020
they're not eating these sugary
foods and this western diet,

878
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,560
the ones that live in America are the
ones that live in America are becoming

879
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:16,860
obese. The ones that live in Mexico or
not. Is that correct? Correct. Yeah.

880
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:21,600
And so now if you have someone
with obesity, like I've said,

881
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:26,660
the most accurate measures that we have
suggest that they habitually consume and

882
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:29,040
expend more calories.

883
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,640
And now Gary's model says that that
is downstream of the fattening effect.

884
00:55:33,641 --> 00:55:38,180
It's not causing the fattening effect.
It is a result of the fattening effect.

885
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:42,740
Whereas my model says that
that is actually required
for the fattening effects

886
00:55:42,741 --> 00:55:46,370
to occur. It has upstream. So now
what happens? What happens here?

887
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,920
What happens if you reduce their
calorie intake by that same amount,

888
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:57,120
20 to 35%. It doesn't matter if you
do it by restricting carbs or fat.

889
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:58,560
These experiments have been done.

890
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:03,240
They lose weight when you restrict
their calorie intake down to that.

891
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:07,410
This is the argument what you're saying
that you keep consuming low amounts of

892
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:11,000
calories but high amounts of sugar does.
It doesn't make sense.

893
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:15,840
You can get obese that way.
Um, when you're saying it's
a calorie, yeah, correct.

894
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,080
And that's referenced number nine and 10.
Um,

895
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,180
to support what I just said and I want
to talk about another one that really can

896
00:56:21,181 --> 00:56:24,040
we out on stuff. That's
what, what I, the reason

897
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,040
I was using the dual burden example is
because we have to explain how those

898
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:32,860
women reading all those
calories. Usually women, again,

899
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:37,450
it's just often it was in trough in
these studies were done by diabetes

900
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:41,020
researchers who were studying diabetes
in these populations and the men had high

901
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:45,250
levels of diabetes in the women
had to high levels of obesity. Um,

902
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
to give you an example where
that measurement was done
in Trinidad in the 1960s

903
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,000
and again, all I'm doing, this is the
role I played as I asked the question,

904
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:58,570
can you find populations that
don't have a lot of food? Okay.

905
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:01,660
You could say that the obese expend
a lot of energy and they ate a lot of

906
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:04,480
calories. The question is can they
get obese without a lot of food?

907
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:06,640
And so can we find populations like us?

908
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:09,520
Can you find a population
that gets obese without sugar?

909
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,880
Which was exactly the question to ask.
So in Trinidad,

910
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:15,220
in the 1960s as a malnutrition crisis,

911
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:19,330
the u s government sends a team of
researchers down to study this and the

912
00:57:19,331 --> 00:57:22,300
researchers come back and say, yeah,
there's malnutrition, there's stunting,

913
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:23,800
there's deficiency diseases.

914
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,690
And two thirds of the adult women are
obese and this is a medical problem.

915
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:33,070
And the next year and MIT nutritionists
goes down to do exactly what Stephan s

916
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:38,100
four and to actually measure the diets
and obese women and lean women and to

917
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,130
study it. And this is the population,
whether it's, it's unlike,

918
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,020
I mean this is a very poor Trinidad
and population and reports that they,

919
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:50,830
I think it was 1800 calories a day with
the obese woman reading was actually a

920
00:57:50,831 --> 00:57:54,550
little less than what the lean people
seem to be eating and that it was lower

921
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:58,360
than what the Food and
Agriculture Organization
considered for a healthy diet.

922
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,051
So again,

923
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:02,800
what my role in this is to point out
when you have populations like that,

924
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:08,020
I don't see how the overeating hypothesis
tells me the brain is in control of

925
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:11,620
how much they eat tells me anything
about why the women were obese,

926
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:16,180
especially when their kids are starving.
This is the paradox of the stool burden.

927
00:58:16,181 --> 00:58:19,660
An obese mother with a starving child,
if there'll be some other,

928
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:23,290
has to eat superfluids
calories to get fat.

929
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,900
Why hasn't she given those calories to
our kids? Because she doesn't need him.

930
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:32,890
She clearly doesn't need them. She's
got fuel, so what's going on there?

931
00:58:32,891 --> 00:58:35,050
If you posit a hypothesis as I did,

932
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:39,580
which says that the obesity is triggered
by the macronutrient content of the

933
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:44,320
Diet, then you can explain. I mean
there are plenty of animal models.

934
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:47,620
A famous quote I use in my
books from John my year,

935
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:52,210
it was like the fame leading Harvard
nutritionists who studied an ob strain of

936
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:57,100
animals in the 50s he said, my animals
will get fat. Even when half starved,

937
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,320
they will make fat out of their food.

938
00:58:59,321 --> 00:59:04,090
Even when half starved is are generally
animals with mutations in the Leptin.

939
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,660
It doesn't, whatever
gene, whatever gene it is.

940
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:10,210
It's kind of the question is if Mike,

941
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,890
I can make fat out of my food at levels of

942
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:20,200
caloric levels at for instance,
a lean person can't,

943
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,980
then I'm going to get fat eating the

944
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,370
same amount and that fat
accumulation is going to be,

945
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,940
you know means I'm taking in
more calories and I expand.

946
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:32,390
But the point is I'm for some
metabolic hormonal reason,

947
00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:36,500
I'm taking the fuel I eat and turning
it into fat and storing it in the fat

948
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:38,660
tissue. What does your responses? Yeah,

949
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:42,440
so my response is that if
you want the best answers,

950
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,850
you have to use the best methods to
answer it, to answer the questions. Okay.

951
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,740
Do you want a question answered properly?

952
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:53,600
You have to use accurate methods to
answer that question. Now, as you know,

953
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:57,800
Gary, it's very difficult to measure
food intake and free living individuals.

954
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,670
Particularly you're traveling to a
country you've never been to before.

955
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,340
It's very difficult to
get accurate measures.

956
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:08,810
So just because some guy went to
Trinidad and claim woman actual, okay,

957
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:09,710
fine.

958
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:13,430
Just because some woman went to Trinidad
and claimed that people were eating

959
01:00:13,431 --> 01:00:16,940
1800 calories and becoming obese does
not mean that that's what actually

960
01:00:16,941 --> 01:00:21,440
happened. Now, let me, no, no,
no, no. Gary, I'm responding now.

961
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:26,710
We have studies where researchers used
accurate measures to measure calorie

962
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:30,650
intake in people who had obesity.

963
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:35,540
Many of these people were saying,
we're only eating 1200 calories a day.

964
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,160
When they actually measured
their calorie intake.

965
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:43,180
What they found was that
they were consistently eating
more calories than lean

966
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:45,200
people.
So this,

967
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:50,230
this phenomenon that Gary describes is
something that is only observed when

968
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:53,480
inferior methods are
used to measure calories.

969
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,380
The reason I'm using these populations,
like I said,

970
01:00:57,381 --> 01:01:00,650
I'm just giving you an observation.
Ob smaller with a starving child,

971
01:01:00,651 --> 01:01:05,180
the dual burden of malnutrition,
obesity. This isn't one observation,

972
01:01:05,181 --> 01:01:06,770
it's not one nutritionist.

973
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:12,010
The existence of the starving children
strongly suggests that there's not a lot

974
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:18,200
of food available and we have to
explain obesity in the model. You know,

975
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:22,100
I would like you to respond. Okay,
fine. I will respond to that. Now look,

976
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:24,170
I haven't looked at these
studies in particular.

977
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,640
I brought them up eight years ago.

978
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:29,420
We got in a fight about it [inaudible]
years ago. It ruined our, you know,

979
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:33,620
it's like are we used to
be by. So now look, um,

980
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:38,680
there are many reasons why a child
could be malnourished in a nonindustrial

981
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:40,640
situation.
And this is,

982
01:01:40,641 --> 01:01:45,290
I do a lot of work related to this and
what you see in nonindustrial situations,

983
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:49,790
you see a lot of infectious disease.
You see a lot of um,

984
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:51,170
malnutrition.

985
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:55,070
So people not getting enough essential
minerals and vitamins not getting enough

986
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,904
protein.

987
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:59,990
And you see a lot of children who are
just barely hanging on because of this

988
01:01:59,991 --> 01:02:04,490
collection of really bad stuff that's
happening in their lives. And so sites,

989
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,980
things. Yeah, yeah. Parasites, malaria.

990
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:11,300
I Dunno if there's malaria and Trinidad
or not, but I mean all the diarrhea,

991
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,480
pneumonia, these are the
things that we all had before.

992
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,090
We had modern medicine
and great sanitation.

993
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:18,620
And then the country
like the United States,

994
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,540
30% of kids didn't even
make it past childhood.

995
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:25,110
And so there's a lot of things
that could have caused that. Gary.

996
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:28,140
It's not necessarily because,
you know,

997
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,790
it's not necessarily the reason
that you attribute it to now.

998
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,670
I'm not attributing it to a reason. I'm
just asking. Okay, well great. Well, I,

999
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:38,310
I don't have the explanation,

1000
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:43,080
but I'm throwing out possibilities that
are alternative to the one that you're

1001
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:46,820
implying is quite
possible. Okay. So now, um,

1002
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,930
I, so again, when you use accurate
measures of calorie intake,

1003
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:56,490
you find that these people with magical
metabolisms who have obesity and don't

1004
01:02:56,491 --> 01:03:01,440
eat very much seem to not exist
anymore. Um, and furthermore, I want to,

1005
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:03,980
I want to get to us to another type
of study that's really going to

1006
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:08,981
differentiate between this metabolic
effect driven by insulin and the effect of

1007
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:11,964
calories.

1008
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:17,010
So we have a lot of studies that compared
diets in which calories were the same

1009
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,920
but carbohydrate and fat intake deferred.

1010
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,790
And the ones that I really want to focus
on right now that I think are key here

1011
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:27,270
are this studies where they
increased calorie intake.

1012
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:32,550
So they fed people, they f one
study in particular. And um,

1013
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:36,720
let's see, I'm going to
give you a number here. Um,

1014
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:42,660
let me see if I can give you
a number here. Sorry. Why
don't you look at that. Um,

1015
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,153
can we,
uh,

1016
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,520
bring up another issue because what we're
talking about ultimately is why people

1017
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:50,520
get fat. Okay. I don't, I
don't want to divert here. I'm
in the middle of something.

1018
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:51,810
So,
um,

1019
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:56,520
now if we want to understand
why people get fat,

1020
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:01,910
we can look at studies that overfed
people on fat or carbohydrate exclusively.

1021
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:07,110
So this one study, um, the first
one that I want to talk about first,

1022
01:04:07,111 --> 01:04:09,840
they figured out people's
baseline calorie intake,

1023
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:13,230
figure out how many calories
they need to just to maintain.

1024
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:18,500
And then they increase that by 50% by
exclusively giving them fat or exclusively

1025
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:24,090
giving them carbohydrate. Okay,
study was, this is Horton. Okay.

1026
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:28,680
Um, give me a yes, a
number 16, number 16. So,

1027
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:33,180
um,
now if Gary's hypothesis is correct,

1028
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:38,130
these people should have gained body fat
on the carbohydrate overfeeding but not

1029
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:41,220
the fat overfeeding because
that increases your insulin,

1030
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:43,560
it has these effects on your
fat cells, et Cetera. Okay.

1031
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:45,780
Now these were very rigorous studies.

1032
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:49,160
I want to emphasize that they monitor the,

1033
01:04:49,161 --> 01:04:52,940
the actual Khoury's that got correct.
Yes, they were. They were good.

1034
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,420
They had a baseline. They use prisoners
and they per month state prison. No,

1035
01:04:57,421 --> 01:05:00,900
that's incorrect. This is a different
study. So they, they had a baseline.

1036
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,460
And did they require them to maintain
the same dye and then add additional fat

1037
01:05:05,461 --> 01:05:10,040
or additional carbohydrates?
Yes. So same guy, same food,

1038
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,310
and then they just bump it up with
fat, with carbohydrate, Horton.

1039
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:17,670
It wasn't Sims, it was anything stems.
Well which talking the monkey, that was

1040
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,560
which study did you do that was
not prisoners? What was the, uh,

1041
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,170
he didn't have a metabolic,
you know what?

1042
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:26,090
Let me just finish describing
the study and we can, Gary,

1043
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,760
that's an irrelevant detail.
Okay.

1044
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:32,440
What's relevant is that you just implied
that I don't know what I'm talking

1045
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:36,750
about, Harry. You know what? I don't
actually know. Maybe it was in prison.

1046
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,910
Thank you. All right.
You're welcome. Now. Um,

1047
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,470
but it was not the Sims overfeeding
study that was done in prison.

1048
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:49,270
That's what I know. Okay. Okay. So what's
the reference? Yeah, it's on my website.

1049
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:51,320
You can go to my website,
Stephan,

1050
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:55,600
dna.com and it's referenced number
16 and they're both there. Okay.

1051
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:00,190
So this was what's called a metabolic
ward study where these people were in a

1052
01:06:00,191 --> 01:06:05,191
research facility where the researchers
could monitor and control every morsel

1053
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,590
of food. So there was no
cheating, no inaccuracy.

1054
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:12,550
And they were measuring changes in body
fatness using a gold standard method

1055
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,410
called underwater weighing.
Okay.

1056
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,980
And so what they found was that at the
end of a two week period of over feeding

1057
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,910
the carb and the fat groups gained
the exact same amount of body fat,

1058
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:26,980
exact same amount of body fat.

1059
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,020
There was another second study that did
the same thing and found the same result.

1060
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,540
Independent lab group,
very similar experiment.

1061
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:38,440
Three week long instead of two weeks,
they found the exact same thing,

1062
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:41,410
same amount of fat gain,
different insulin responses,

1063
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,670
different amounts of carbohydrate in
that exact same amount of fat gain.

1064
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,700
So this demonstrates that insulin is not,

1065
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:53,050
and carbs are not what controls
what gets fat into fat tissue.

1066
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:57,250
Calorie intake is what controls that.
So let me explain it again.

1067
01:06:57,251 --> 01:07:01,690
Remember I talked about the paradigm you
work in determines the question you ask.

1068
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:06,190
And this experiment is a classic example
because they assume that people get fat

1069
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:10,030
by overfeeding.
So then they say if we overfeed them,

1070
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,030
we've just doing what happens naturally.

1071
01:07:13,031 --> 01:07:17,380
Everything about the experiment is based
on the assumption that they're supposed

1072
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:21,910
to be testing, which is Ken. People
get fat by overfeed it. And so the,

1073
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,040
from the Berry conception
of the experiment they've
built in the paradigm that

1074
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:30,580
we want to test the hypothesis,
I'm on top of it.

1075
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:34,540
If it's a typical sims experiment,
I actually wasn't familiar with this one.

1076
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:38,560
Oh it was a,
it wasn't sims was a James.

1077
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,070
Oh Jc Peter.

1078
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:43,870
James Hill was funded for the,

1079
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:49,230
from about 1998 to about 2008 by proctor
and gamble cause he was in a less Stra

1080
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:55,270
shill. I hate to say that
Jim, I apologize, but I
think it's a fair assessment.

1081
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,880
And then when he stopped being
funded by proctor and gamble,

1082
01:07:57,881 --> 01:07:59,540
he was funded by the sugar industry.

1083
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:04,270
He's and JC Peters was the
head of the Procter and gamble,

1084
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:08,350
Leicester, Leicester, which is now
something that no one eats. Yeah,

1085
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:11,990
Lester was a fat substituted.
It problem was you'd got like run out

1086
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:18,670
shit like that but the whole idea of a
Lustra was to replace fat in the Diet.

1087
01:08:19,401 --> 01:08:24,320
So every study hoe and
Peters did implicated dietary
fat as a cause of obesity.

1088
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:27,310
I don't think we could ever use,
I hate to say it, I'm typically I,

1089
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:31,390
I don't think funding influences
results but I wouldn't use it.

1090
01:08:31,391 --> 01:08:34,580
James Hill study to make that point that

1091
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,690
because you think it's a biased
study that was in everything.

1092
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,630
Everything Helen Peters did and one knows.

1093
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:43,910
I mean I talked about
this in good calories,

1094
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,740
bad calories when they
reported their results.

1095
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,580
Actually I did a foyer on James Hill
cause he works for the University of

1096
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:50,960
Colorado.
You could actually get,

1097
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:54,250
I got all his documents back and
forth between him and the Lester.

1098
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,380
I'd be happy to share them with
you if you'd like there. Rebel at,

1099
01:08:57,410 --> 01:09:01,370
I mean him and proctor and gamble but
he basically held Procter and gamble for

1100
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:01,911
ransom.

1101
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:06,911
He would get a $500,000 unrestricted gift
and then he would do a study and then

1102
01:09:07,941 --> 01:09:12,941
he would ask and it would conclude
that fat is bad and carbs are good and

1103
01:09:13,341 --> 01:09:15,350
therefore a Lester as a viable product.

1104
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:20,351
Then he would ask for proctor and gamble
for more money before he then published

1105
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:21,323
study.

1106
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:26,630
So it's a particularly egregious
example of someone who's,

1107
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:29,750
I suspect it was just a belief system.
He believed dietary fat,

1108
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:31,780
what's bad fat causes obesity.
Uh,

1109
01:09:31,781 --> 01:09:35,240
Lester is a good thing because you eat
that instead of fat and you don't absorb

1110
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:39,240
it. And then every study
he did confirm that. Um,

1111
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:44,650
the point that we keep getting away from
that I haven't had an opportunity to,

1112
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,490
um,
and Stephanie knows this as well as I do.

1113
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:54,490
If you're gaining say four pounds a year
of fat or let's say between 20 and 40,

1114
01:09:54,781 --> 01:09:58,340
you've put on 40 extra pounds. So
now you're obese, you're nice, lean,

1115
01:09:58,341 --> 01:10:02,270
healthy young guy in 20, like many of
us were. And by the time you're 40,

1116
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,670
you've got 40 pounds of excess fat.

1117
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:09,850
That's the equivalent of putting in about
a 10 calories is had storing about 10

1118
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:16,040
calories a day into your fat tissue
that you don't burn a metabolized.

1119
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:19,430
So you eat,
say 2,700 calories a day,

1120
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:24,710
half carbs, you know,
35% fat, 15% protein,

1121
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:28,250
and 10 calories that they get
trapped in your fat tissue,

1122
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:33,740
less than a bytes worth the food
less than a sips worth of beer.

1123
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:38,090
So the question we're actually
trying to ask is our answer,

1124
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:42,080
and this is again just my approach as a
curious journalists too with a science

1125
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:45,200
background. This, how do we
explain those 10 calories?

1126
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,920
Because when we talk about those
obese women with starving children,

1127
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:53,750
all those obese women were doing was
storing 10 or 20 calories a day depending

1128
01:10:53,751 --> 01:10:55,490
on how quickly they became obese.

1129
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:59,780
And those populations that tends
to happen quickly in their 20s. Um,

1130
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,850
so we're asking this question,
how do we,

1131
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:07,430
if you've got a situation where we have
to end up with 10 calories stuck in the

1132
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:11,930
fat cells every day, that's
2030, 40 billion fat cells.

1133
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:13,680
So it's divided up very small.

1134
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,400
And is the brain somehow
regulating that or again,

1135
01:11:18,401 --> 01:11:23,401
is her a dysregulation in the
body involving pick your hormones,

1136
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:26,880
pick your enzymes when the one,
um,

1137
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:32,300
that somehow traps fat in the fat cells
or prevents the fat from being used for

1138
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:35,970
fuel when it's released
from the fat cells.

1139
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,010
And so if you think about it that way,
like you let yourself go to seeds today,

1140
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:44,610
Joe Rogan decides I'm done.
I'm going to do nothing but drink beer.

1141
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:48,660
And you might start drinking five beers
a day and over the course of 10 years

1142
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:50,790
you get 20 pounds.
And it's all here.

1143
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:55,110
That 20 pounds over the course of 10
years is still only about 20 calories.

1144
01:11:55,111 --> 01:12:00,111
You might've added 800 calories of beer
to your diet and stored 20 calories as

1145
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:04,560
fat. How does that happen
and why does it go here

1146
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,730
and not elsewhere?
And as Stephen said,

1147
01:12:08,731 --> 01:12:13,320
this is insulin dependent
fat tissue. Um, so those are,

1148
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:15,540
that's one we're talking
about this like this question,

1149
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:20,420
could somebody get fat during a famine
or can they stay fat during a fam?

1150
01:12:20,421 --> 01:12:23,940
And all they have to do is hold
on to 10 calories a day extra.

1151
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:29,210
If they're only eating 1,210
gets stuck in their fat cells,

1152
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:33,290
1,190 is excrete it or are expended.

1153
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:37,790
It's not that hard to imagine. And
there's nothing in the laws of physics.

1154
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:38,311
It says it.

1155
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:43,311
So what could be dysregulated about their
fat cells even during a relative fam

1156
01:12:43,531 --> 01:12:47,460
and not a complete fem and but a relative
fem. And that might be, and again,

1157
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:51,870
an animal experiments of which
there are probably hundreds by now,

1158
01:12:51,871 --> 01:12:53,070
different animal models.

1159
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:57,210
You can disassociate obesity from hype,

1160
01:12:57,211 --> 01:13:00,500
from eating too much in the animals.
Can I pause you for a second? Yeah.

1161
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:04,760
So essentially you're saying that
even if someone is taking in,

1162
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:09,920
uh, a good amount of cowers at the
s the s a smart amount of calories,

1163
01:13:09,921 --> 01:13:11,180
2000 calories a day,

1164
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:15,140
if you're taking in these
calories in the form of sugar,

1165
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:19,010
your body is going to take a
certain percentage of them,

1166
01:13:19,011 --> 01:13:21,800
even if you're getting enough
food and stored as fat.

1167
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:27,310
Whereas if you were taking in just protein
and vegetables and things along those

1168
01:13:28,311 --> 01:13:30,110
lines,
your body would not do that well.

1169
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:35,111
So this is a gets to the
mechanism question and the
evidence question but you're

1170
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:38,780
saying that right? So you're saying that
if two people were on the same diet,

1171
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,730
one of them's on 2000 calories of chicken
and fish and vegetables and the other

1172
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:48,731
one is on 2000 calories of milkshakes
and you know sugary drinks and pasta and

1173
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:56,681
bullshit that that person is going to
gain a certain amount of calories and just

1174
01:13:56,811 --> 01:14:00,320
put them to fat. Right.
Regardless that yeah,

1175
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:02,300
that [inaudible]

1176
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,290
this being a science, that hypothesis
can be tested and Stephan, thanks.

1177
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:11,140
It's been tested 80
times. Stephanie, it's,

1178
01:14:11,141 --> 01:14:16,141
they've done a bad job of testing it and
we will both tend to reject the studies

1179
01:14:17,651 --> 01:14:20,860
that we don't like when we define don't
light by whether or not they got the

1180
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:21,694
answer.
We think

1181
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:23,750
your perspective is that
this is not the case.

1182
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:27,490
Your perspective is that like as you
were saying in this study with a closely

1183
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:31,550
monitored these people's diets and
the added additional fat and had an

1184
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,840
additional carbohydrates that they both
gained the same additional amount of

1185
01:14:35,841 --> 01:14:38,660
what it's right. I mean if cases
isn't shot, this is correct.

1186
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,390
You have to see different
levels of fat gain.

1187
01:14:41,391 --> 01:14:45,590
I mean a short term study that did was
how short term was it a two in three

1188
01:14:45,591 --> 01:14:48,530
weeks. That's very short.
Yeah, it is very short term.

1189
01:14:48,531 --> 01:14:53,531
But Still Gary says that insulin is the
thing that gets fat in fat cells and

1190
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:56,360
that, I mean you would see
some kind of difference.

1191
01:14:56,361 --> 01:15:00,140
It insulin made any difference but you
should've seen some kind of effect, right?

1192
01:15:00,141 --> 01:15:01,880
Some kind of difference in fact game.

1193
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,180
Um,
I don't want to start taking out charts,

1194
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:08,840
but this gets into insulin dynamics
that was worked out so over, uh,

1195
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:15,960
um,
I promised I wasn't going to say oil boy.

1196
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,970
Why on the show, but it's my
thanks to my Brooklyn born mother.

1197
01:15:19,971 --> 01:15:22,970
It's my programmed in.
Um,

1198
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,490
and a the same is true. A lot of these
overfeeding experiments do the same thing.

1199
01:15:28,491 --> 01:15:32,840
So when they talk about over feeding,
they, they, they literally over feed.

1200
01:15:32,841 --> 01:15:37,340
So they kind of do a reasonable way of
figuring out which reading is Stephen.

1201
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,380
They measured,
uh,

1202
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:43,370
they calculated how much energy they
needed to stay in energy and balance.

1203
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:44,570
And again,
right there,

1204
01:15:44,571 --> 01:15:49,571
that's a problem because one of the
hypotheses says that the energy balance is

1205
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:53,090
dependent on the macronutrient
content of the food.

1206
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,580
So you're going to get a different
different level depending on what the

1207
01:15:58,581 --> 01:16:02,360
macronutrient content is
and then different level of,

1208
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:06,020
of what what's necessary
for energy balance.

1209
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:11,020
So the classic example is a study
that's my not for profit funded,

1210
01:16:11,151 --> 01:16:14,930
that's been very controversial where they

1211
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:20,600
got their subjects,
this is David Ludwig and get rambling.

1212
01:16:20,601 --> 01:16:22,360
And there their colleagues at that,

1213
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:25,490
that Harvard and Boston Children's
Hospital and they did this study in

1214
01:16:25,491 --> 01:16:28,730
Framingham and they,
they basically got, uh,

1215
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
subjects to lose 10 or 12% of their body
weight and then they randomized them to

1216
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:39,830
three different diets have three
different macronutrient composition.

1217
01:16:39,831 --> 01:16:44,030
Then they basically calculated their
energy expenditure on the three different

1218
01:16:44,031 --> 01:16:44,511
diets,

1219
01:16:44,511 --> 01:16:48,560
which is kind of exactly what we're
talking about because if you want to be an

1220
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:52,700
energy balance, who know, you feed
people exactly what they're expanding.

1221
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:56,090
And in that study,
which was published a year ago,

1222
01:16:56,091 --> 01:17:01,040
and they saw different levels of
energy expenditure depending on the

1223
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:05,510
carbohydrate content of the Diet.
So the higher level of carbohydrates,

1224
01:17:05,511 --> 01:17:10,460
this is trying to keep them in energy
balance. The, the higher the carbohydrate,

1225
01:17:10,461 --> 01:17:14,240
the lower the energy expenditure,
the lower the carbohydrate,

1226
01:17:14,241 --> 01:17:16,700
the higher the energy expenditure.
So again,

1227
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:19,550
it's just whether or not they
did the study, right? Who knows.

1228
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:23,870
Science is a compilation of a lot of
studies and we're trying to, you know,

1229
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:26,660
address exactly this point,
but

1230
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,360
merely building that into the experiment,

1231
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,860
we know what their energy
expenditure should be.

1232
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:36,920
And then the point is when
you increase in part, again,

1233
01:17:36,921 --> 01:17:39,050
part of the trick of doing
science, it's to say, look,

1234
01:17:39,051 --> 01:17:43,550
we have competing hypotheses,
uh, multiple hypotheses.

1235
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:48,940
And it's vitally important that you always
keep the multiple hypotheses in mind

1236
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:51,380
when you're interpreting the study.

1237
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:55,340
So one hypothesis says it's how much
they eat and another hypothesis says it's

1238
01:17:55,341 --> 01:18:00,020
what they eat and that what they eat is,
is moderated primarily through insulin.

1239
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,800
And when you do these experiments
at the experiment that, that uh,

1240
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:10,670
Steve, so Steven is
talking about Stephan, um,

1241
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:14,960
I'm completely confused.
Uh, if you overfeed them,

1242
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:18,650
you start out with a 50% carb diet.
Now you overfeed them.

1243
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:23,750
If there's a threshold effect on insulin,
which turns out there is,

1244
01:18:23,751 --> 01:18:26,660
then you're just moving them. And when
you're looking at insulin dynamics,

1245
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:28,610
when insulin is below a very low point,

1246
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:32,510
the fat cells will mobilize
fat and the lean tissue,

1247
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:36,080
we'll burn it for fuel. And above
that point you get pretty much flat.

1248
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:41,530
So if you start people who are eating
1500 calories from carbs and you add them,

1249
01:18:43,081 --> 01:18:47,900
bump them up to 2,500 calories from carbs
are still in the plateau side of the

1250
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:51,110
incident, you wouldn't necessarily
expect to see any difference.

1251
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,420
The only way you expect
to see a difference.

1252
01:18:53,421 --> 01:18:58,421
And that's why it helps
to really interrogate both
hypotheses so that you know

1253
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:00,110
when you're doing the experiment,

1254
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:03,860
whether or not you're actually
testing something, you one hypothesis,

1255
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:08,000
you want to set up the experiments with
a hypothesis predicts the two hypotheses.

1256
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,210
Predict something entirely different.
This experiment,

1257
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:14,180
arguably the two hypotheses
predict the same thing.

1258
01:19:14,181 --> 01:19:17,360
You'll get fat gain because
insulin is elevated regardless,

1259
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:20,660
and when insulin is elevated,
you're going to get fat gain.

1260
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:25,040
The question comes back to this again,
always fight on to keep this in mind.

1261
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:30,041
We want to what could possibly cause at
10 or 20 calorie excess that causes fat

1262
01:19:31,281 --> 01:19:35,060
storage. I have a friend that was
for 400 pounds when he was 18.

1263
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:39,390
It was a tall kid, about six
foot five. Um, he was, uh,

1264
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,350
say 200 pounds over weight,

1265
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:46,540
200 pounds overweight is roughly a hundred
excess calories over 18 years stored

1266
01:19:48,021 --> 01:19:50,210
in your fat cells. That's, you know,

1267
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:55,360
even if you assume that you have to
consume 300 calories to have 100 excess

1268
01:19:57,461 --> 01:19:59,620
stored in your fat
cells, that's, you know,

1269
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:04,660
one to Coca Cola is a day that he was
drinking or one half a quarter pounder or

1270
01:20:05,811 --> 01:20:08,070
a day that he was eating.
And that is lean friends warrant.

1271
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,180
And the question would be, why can't
you just stop doing that? And again,

1272
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:12,961
Stephan would say,

1273
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:17,961
cause there's brain won't let him and
I would say because his insulin is

1274
01:20:18,331 --> 01:20:21,000
elevated, it doesn't matter
whether he stops it or not,

1275
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:25,560
he's got into your Tressie
underlying mechanism. Okay. Um,

1276
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:30,600
all right, so now again,
it's easy to tell stories.

1277
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:35,190
It's not easy to tell stories that are
supported by scientific evidence. Now,

1278
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,043
um,

1279
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:40,230
I want to bring people's attention
to reference number 11 on my site.

1280
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,800
There have been 29 studies now that
have measured differences in energy

1281
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:50,490
expenditure, metabolic for Kevin
Hall study met analysis, correct.

1282
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,500
There've been 29 studies to date that
I've measured calorie expenditure,

1283
01:20:55,501 --> 01:21:00,060
metabolic rate on diets differing
in carbohydrate and fat content.

1284
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,370
And when you put all
those studies together,

1285
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:06,600
when you are at least the first 28
together and you look at what the overall

1286
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:07,650
literature says,

1287
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,760
it makes almost no difference to
metabolic rate whether people are eating

1288
01:21:11,761 --> 01:21:13,170
carbohydrate or fat.

1289
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:18,060
And in fact this very small difference
that it does make actually favors high

1290
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:19,380
carbohydrate diets.

1291
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:24,210
So you get a slightly higher metabolic
rate when the Diet is predominantly

1292
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:25,050
carbohydrate.

1293
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:30,440
Now this study that Gary's side is
the one study out of these 29 that has

1294
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:36,240
reported a larger effect than any others
of carbohydrate restriction on energy

1295
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:36,811
expenditure.

1296
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:41,640
So this study reported and affect
bigger than any of these other 28 and

1297
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:46,170
different. Sweet, thank you.

1298
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,590
Um, and, and interestingly,

1299
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:53,640
if you actually look at the data and
these data have been Rhea analyzed by a

1300
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:57,510
researcher named Kevin Hall.
And if you look at the data,

1301
01:21:57,511 --> 01:22:00,180
you find that some of the participants,

1302
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:05,070
some of the data that represent some
of these participants are literally

1303
01:22:05,071 --> 01:22:08,910
physically impossible. They break
the first law of thermodynamics.

1304
01:22:08,911 --> 01:22:11,370
This is the conservation of energy.
Gary knows about this.

1305
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:15,180
He has a physics background and
they literally don't add up.

1306
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,680
And when you start subtracting the,

1307
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,000
the clearly erroneous data
from the pool of subjects,

1308
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:28,400
this big effect size starts to shrink
and shrink and shrink and shrink until

1309
01:22:28,831 --> 01:22:32,250
after you've gotten rid of all of it.
This study does no longer,

1310
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:37,110
no longer reports a higher
energy expenditure on a
very low carbohydrate diet

1311
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:41,130
and it's consistent with the
previous 28 studies that were done.

1312
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,200
So that's my perspective on that.

1313
01:22:43,201 --> 01:22:47,520
But I want to go back to this [inaudible]
you taught her a long time and I'm

1314
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:50,890
going to talk for as long as I want.
Now I want to,

1315
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:55,350
I want to talk about human energy
metabolism in this idea of the 10 extra

1316
01:22:55,351 --> 01:22:57,900
calories a day. Gary, I,

1317
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:02,640
I really continue to get the feeling that
you do not understand human energetics,

1318
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:05,010
um, because that's not
how it works. But no,

1319
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:07,480
just saying 10 calories
stored in the fat tissue,

1320
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:13,210
10 calories and say anything about how
much you have to eat. I'm not done. Okay.

1321
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,390
No, but you're in me. Sorry.
You got to stop doing that dude.

1322
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:20,470
Keep acting like you think I'm an idiot.
All right. Are you done now? Are you done?

1323
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:23,200
Can we be clear that we're
talking about you done now?

1324
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,480
Can I just finish this until I'm dying?
Without Gary,

1325
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:30,310
you had time to respond.
You can respond,

1326
01:23:30,311 --> 01:23:33,610
write down notes on what you want
to respond to and after he's done,

1327
01:23:33,611 --> 01:23:34,130
you can tell him,

1328
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:38,170
but we're going to get into a long
course on something that's not the point.

1329
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,560
Fine. Thank you. Okay,

1330
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:44,170
now what you see,

1331
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,020
there's basically two things you need
to pay attention to here in terms of

1332
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:47,854
energetics.

1333
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:52,330
One is the imbalance between
intake and expenditure,

1334
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,650
and that is very small,

1335
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:58,000
so it only takes a little bit of extra
calories to cause somebody to start

1336
01:23:58,001 --> 01:24:02,110
gaining fat. However, as they
gain fat, their bodies get bigger.

1337
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:04,210
They're gaining fat and lean mass.

1338
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:09,070
People with obesity have more fat and
more lean mass and their calorie needs go

1339
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,490
up and up and up and up.
The larger their bodies get.

1340
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:17,710
And so even though the imbalance between
energy and taking expenditure is small,

1341
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:21,900
their calorie needs end up being quite
a bit higher. So I pause for a second.

1342
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:25,690
Yeah. So you're saying that
someone just gaining calories,

1343
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:29,790
eating additional calories, their body
gains lean mass as well? That's correct.

1344
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:34,540
How does the brain regulate that? I didn't
say it regulated by the dog. Hold on.

1345
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:37,780
That's so fascinating.
How does the play muscle muscle,

1346
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:40,420
they're gaining muscle to some
of his muscles. Some of it's

1347
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:47,170
because it's because they're carrying
around this extra weight and so the extra

1348
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:50,890
calories and then on top of that carrying
around the extra weight forces your

1349
01:24:50,891 --> 01:24:55,720
body to grow larger. Presumably I'm, I'm
actually not sure what the mechanism is,

1350
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,790
but it doesn't have anything
to do with the brain.

1351
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:03,670
I don't know what causes it. That's
what I'm saying, Gary. Okay. Now, um,

1352
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:06,100
so,
so,

1353
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:10,090
but the point is by the
time the person has obesity,

1354
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:15,150
they are consuming 20 to 35% more calories
than they were when they were lean.

1355
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:19,630
So that's not just a
one or two cokes a day.

1356
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:23,530
That is allowing them to remain obese.

1357
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,800
They are consuming 20
to 35% more calories.

1358
01:25:26,801 --> 01:25:29,020
That is with the most
accurate studies are saying.

1359
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:34,470
And so it's not just 10 extra calories
or maybe just one or two cokes.

1360
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:37,930
We're talking about a substantial
amount of extra calories.

1361
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:40,330
And isn't this a generalization
because we don't know what I mean?

1362
01:25:40,331 --> 01:25:44,680
What's the ratio of how much fat people
get, how much weight people are gaining.

1363
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,210
Everybody gains a
different amount of weight.

1364
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:51,220
And you're saying they're eating 20 to
30% more cowers like who is like how many

1365
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:53,350
people, how much are they
gaining? Or people get fat,

1366
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:55,360
they get 20 pounds overweight.
People get fat,

1367
01:25:55,361 --> 01:25:58,030
they get a hundred pounds overweight.
They'd be a that's right. Yeah.

1368
01:25:58,031 --> 01:26:02,020
And that's why I give a range because
what you see is that people who are

1369
01:26:02,021 --> 01:26:05,720
overweight, so they're in the overweight
range, you just have some extra fat.

1370
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:08,270
They eat about 10% extra calories.

1371
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:12,260
People who have a little bit of
obesity eat about 20% extra calories.

1372
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:16,280
People who have, who are very,
have very, very great obesity,

1373
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:20,150
eat more like 35%. So it tracks
with the amount, I'm sorry,

1374
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:24,920
is it possible what he was saying that
if you do consume 10 extra calories over

1375
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:29,290
long periods of time, that will
accumulate extra calories cumulate

1376
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,910
like pen diamonds going into this.
So how much do you have to DePaul?

1377
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:35,930
It is correct.

1378
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:41,620
It is correct that if every day you eat
10 calories more than what you need,

1379
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,540
then yes. Or your body or
your body stores. Yeah.

1380
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:50,180
I will say that if your
body is storing 10%, 10,

1381
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:52,790
10 extra calories over
top of what you need,

1382
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,740
but the thing is that as you get bigger,

1383
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:58,280
what you need goes up and
up and up because you're
carrying around more correct.

1384
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:01,760
And so it's 10% and Tenex or
cow it, sorry, not percent.

1385
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:06,761
It's 10 extra calories on
top of the elevated amount
that you're already eating.

1386
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:12,410
So you end up with these big differences
in calories tick. So that's how,

1387
01:27:12,411 --> 01:27:15,260
that's how it really works.
But I want to talk about, um,

1388
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:19,850
some interesting observations
because Gary, you like to
talk about, um, you know,

1389
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:23,540
what's going on in different dietary
trends and different cultures.

1390
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:25,190
And I find that pretty interesting too.

1391
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:30,850
I want to talk about the fact that sugar
intake in the United States has been

1392
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:33,650
declining for the last 20 years.

1393
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,850
So it peaked in 1999 and it is currently,

1394
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,130
depending on which source
of evidence you believe,

1395
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,510
15 to 23% lower than it was in 1999.

1396
01:27:44,511 --> 01:27:47,420
This has been corroborated by a number
of different sources of evidence.

1397
01:27:47,421 --> 01:27:50,510
This is number 17 on my blog.

1398
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:54,380
And of course we know that
obesity has increased.

1399
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:59,030
Diabetes has increased substantially over
the last 20 years in the percentage of

1400
01:27:59,031 --> 01:28:02,870
the population are actually
numbers percentage. Yeah. And uh,

1401
01:28:02,871 --> 01:28:07,610
and UK sugar intake has been declining
for 50 years. I don't believe that.

1402
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,680
Okay, well, you can argue with the data.

1403
01:28:09,681 --> 01:28:14,510
They're a number 17 and my
blog there are about 22% lower.

1404
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:17,900
And this is what we see across
a number of different, uh,

1405
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:19,100
industrialized countries.

1406
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:24,101
You see a stagnation or decline and
sugar intake in recent decades as obesity

1407
01:28:25,311 --> 01:28:27,140
rates are continuing to increase.

1408
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:32,510
And of course that 50 year period that
covers the decline in the UK covers the

1409
01:28:32,511 --> 01:28:36,470
entire UK obesity and diabetes epidemics.
Um,

1410
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:39,650
but there's another one I want to talk
about that and I respond to that. Yeah,

1411
01:28:39,651 --> 01:28:41,770
we should probably look sponsor Stephan,

1412
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:45,800
actually I'll let you respond for me
because we had this debate with the Keto

1413
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:49,340
Foundation. So you know my
art counterargument, you
want to give it? Yeah, sure.

1414
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:52,460
Absolutely. I mean are you sure
you want to let me give it though,

1415
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,830
am I correct that? Okay. All right.

1416
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:00,880
So your counter argument is that
the amount of that we consumed

1417
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:06,150
20 years ago or even maybe 50 years ago,

1418
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:11,510
maybe continuing to fatten us today and
it's about the sugar that we used to eat

1419
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:16,440
20 or 50 years ago and not necessarily
about the sugar we eat today.

1420
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,660
Well it's not exactly right. Okay. I get,

1421
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:23,370
the argument I made was because he
brought this up when we've had to do a

1422
01:29:23,371 --> 01:29:25,800
written debate on the
Keto Foundation website.

1423
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,100
And it's interesting if you think
about use tobaccos and example.

1424
01:29:29,101 --> 01:29:34,101
So tobacco smoking per capita smoking in
America peaked in 1965 right up to the

1425
01:29:35,311 --> 01:29:39,780
surgeon general's report and it took 30
years before lung cancer rates turned

1426
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:40,950
over.
Okay.

1427
01:29:40,951 --> 01:29:44,310
And I think we both agree that cigarettes
are a major cause of lung cancer

1428
01:29:44,311 --> 01:29:48,450
smoking. So what you basically
have is a system in which,

1429
01:29:48,451 --> 01:29:49,380
if there are any,

1430
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:53,160
there's the assumption that Stephanie is
making when he quotes this kind of data,

1431
01:29:53,161 --> 01:29:57,540
is that the relationship between
sugar and obesity is linear.

1432
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:01,920
So it's sugar goes up, obesity and
diabetes goes up, and if sugar turns over,

1433
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:05,880
they don't. So here's the thought
experiment I used in Keto, which has

1434
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,070
1965 or smoke in per capita,
about 20 cigarettes a day.

1435
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:13,590
As it starts to come down,

1436
01:30:13,591 --> 01:30:18,591
imagine we only cut that to 17
cigarettes or 16 cigarettes,

1437
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:21,090
a 20% reduction in smoking.

1438
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:25,500
Would you expect to see a reduction
in the lung cancer rates? Again,

1439
01:30:25,501 --> 01:30:28,860
this is the point I made about what
you would expect to see rather than new

1440
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:33,720
things. Simplistic Metaphor. So the
question is, would you like Joe,

1441
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:38,550
we go from 20 to 16. Do you expect to
see the lung cancer rates turnover?

1442
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,380
No. No. And in sugar we went
from drop a know you might,

1443
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:47,550
the derivative might drop.
You might expect it to slow a tiny bit.

1444
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,313
Still use,

1445
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,650
there was a bunch of weird comparison
because one of them was poisoned.

1446
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:55,260
The other one's food, right? Well,
but then this case, the food,

1447
01:30:55,261 --> 01:30:59,910
the question is how toxic is the food?
So in sugar, we have a variety in sugar.

1448
01:30:59,911 --> 01:31:04,230
What happened is the equivalent of going
from 20 cigarettes to 16 beginning in

1449
01:31:04,231 --> 01:31:06,840
1999 and Stephen is saying,

1450
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:11,040
I would expect to see an immediate
change in obese. And in fact,

1451
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:13,310
if you actually look at the rates,
the,

1452
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:17,910
the rate of increase in the prevalence
appeared to plateau around six or seven

1453
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:21,750
years later. Uh, who knows
whether that's relevant,

1454
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:26,220
but to get a small decrease
in sugar 20 [inaudible],

1455
01:31:26,221 --> 01:31:30,420
even if it's 20%,
that's 20 to 16 cigarettes.

1456
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:34,920
And I'm saying the other factor that I
talk about my book and stuff in those,

1457
01:31:34,921 --> 01:31:39,921
this is very clearly have
maternal transmission of the
propensity to obesity and

1458
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:43,590
diabetes.
So there's a generational effect.

1459
01:31:43,591 --> 01:31:45,870
This and this is studies
that were done in the same,

1460
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:51,440
on the same pm the same native American
tribe where each generation if gets more

1461
01:31:52,891 --> 01:31:54,420
and more,
uh,

1462
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,170
susceptible to whatever it is in the
Diet that's triggering and obesity and

1463
01:31:58,171 --> 01:32:02,380
diabetes. So that's been happening in
the United States and around the world.

1464
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:06,100
You've got a generational effect
that could last far longer,

1465
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:09,790
might even keep going indefinitely
even if their sugar levels drop.

1466
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:13,990
So you have the sugar quick kicking
off the obesity epidemic and yet it's

1467
01:32:13,991 --> 01:32:17,230
Stephan's about to say this
is a story and it is a story,

1468
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,800
but it's clearly the case that mothers
who are obese during pregnancy or

1469
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:25,240
diabetic or gestationally diabetic,

1470
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:29,470
they become diabetic during pregnancy
or they have metabolic syndrome,

1471
01:32:29,471 --> 01:32:33,610
they're just a insulin resistant or
they gain a lot of weight in pregnancy,

1472
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:37,270
will give birth to children who are at
higher risk of becoming an obese and

1473
01:32:37,271 --> 01:32:38,710
diabetic when they get older.

1474
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:43,900
And a younger age was in those children
will pass it on. So again, we have,

1475
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:45,130
you know,
I would be nice,

1476
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:49,150
I would love it if sugar consumption
came down and with it. Um,

1477
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:51,490
obesity and diabetes plummeted,

1478
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:55,510
but it's not a in any way
reputation of this hypothesis,

1479
01:32:55,511 --> 01:32:59,770
which I just want to state what it is
because people get confused about it and

1480
01:32:59,771 --> 01:33:00,610
we never got to it.

1481
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:05,380
The sugar hypothesis is a little different
than what we've been talking about

1482
01:33:05,381 --> 01:33:06,400
and it's pretty simple.

1483
01:33:06,401 --> 01:33:10,120
We have obesity and diabetes
epidemics worldwide as we talked to.

1484
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:12,700
It doesn't matter the
genetics of the population.

1485
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:17,530
You add something about a western
diet to those populations,

1486
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:21,550
western Diet and lifestyle,
you get these explosions.

1487
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:24,310
Fifth epidemics of obesity and diabetes.

1488
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:29,190
And what I'm hypothesizing in
this book is that sugar is a,

1489
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:33,160
something that has to be added. Maybe
it's sugary beverages for all I know.

1490
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:37,280
Maybe or it could be, you know,
a more complex hypothesis,

1491
01:33:37,281 --> 01:33:38,350
a singer possible.

1492
01:33:38,351 --> 01:33:43,150
One is you add sugar to any
population to dye it in sufficient,

1493
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:47,460
whether it's southeast Asians living on
Rice or the annual it living on reindeer

1494
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,090
and whatever,

1495
01:33:49,091 --> 01:33:52,540
or the native Americans to
the great plains or you know,

1496
01:33:52,541 --> 01:33:55,690
Caucasians living in the
upper east side of Manhattan,

1497
01:33:55,990 --> 01:34:00,990
add enough sugar and eventually through
the metabolic effects of the sugar and

1498
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:03,460
the generational effects,

1499
01:34:03,461 --> 01:34:07,840
you will get explosions of obesity
and diabetes and metabolic.

1500
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,110
You want to respond to that? Sure.
I mean, Gary, you called it man.

1501
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:17,260
It's always possible to tell a
story to salvage your hypothesis,

1502
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:20,080
but that doesn't necessarily
make the story correct. I mean,

1503
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:24,820
I can come up with a story that cosmic
rays cause obesity by hitting my fat

1504
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:28,120
cells and making them fat.
You can't disprove that.

1505
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:29,830
Nobody here can disprove that,

1506
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:34,930
but there's no evidence of an experiment
to protect you from, okay. We don't have,

1507
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:40,000
we don't have the data right
now. You don't have data
supporting your hypothesis.

1508
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:44,870
No, we do. You're just dismissed.
Can I get back to the camera?

1509
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:49,430
Let's let them respond them on
Kevin Hall leader. Yeah. So, um,

1510
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:52,330
what do you think about what he's saying
about sugar and increased rates of

1511
01:34:52,331 --> 01:34:57,010
diabetes and that this is the
cross? Yeah, I mean, so let me,

1512
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,003
it this way.

1513
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:00,860
We don't have any evidence
supporting what he just said.

1514
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:04,700
So that is a story that is
not supported by evidence.

1515
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,290
Now does it, does that mean
that is definitely incorrect.
No, I cannot say that.

1516
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:11,240
That's definitely incorrect.
Same Way.

1517
01:35:11,241 --> 01:35:14,930
I can't say it's definitely incorrect
that cosmic rays cause obesity.

1518
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:17,460
But you know, I'm going
to, I'm going to use it,

1519
01:35:17,461 --> 01:35:22,370
Christopher Hitchens quote here that which
is asserted without evidence does not

1520
01:35:22,371 --> 01:35:23,900
require evidence to refute.

1521
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:28,340
And that's the way I feel about this
particular story. Um, but you know,

1522
01:35:28,341 --> 01:35:33,341
there are cultures that consume large
amounts of sugar and do not develop

1523
01:35:35,031 --> 01:35:40,010
obesity. We've talked about,
and we're going to talk
about it again right now. Um,

1524
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:44,060
so this is referenced number 21.

1525
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:47,900
I'm on my blog. I'm going to talk
about three different cultures,

1526
01:35:47,901 --> 01:35:52,730
one of which we have not talked
about, Gary. The first one is the uh,

1527
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:55,190
the Hadza hunter gatherers of Tanzania.

1528
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,980
This is a really interesting
nonindustrial culture.

1529
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:02,450
They as part of their hunter
gatherer diet, eat a lot of honey.

1530
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:06,500
Honey is a very common food among hunter
gatherers living similarly to how our

1531
01:36:06,501 --> 01:36:11,250
ancestors used to live. And if you
measure there year round honey and take,

1532
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:15,890
it's about 15% of their calories. So
this is a major calorie source for them.

1533
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:18,590
That's about as much sugar
as the average American eats.

1534
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:22,910
And they eat fruit sugar on top of this.
They eat a lot of fruit on top of that.

1535
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,970
And so they're eating
quite a bit of sugar.

1536
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
And the Hadza men have about 12%
body fat women have about 18.

1537
01:36:31,101 --> 01:36:34,970
So they correspond pretty
closely to our western ideals.

1538
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:38,780
What isn't that high for hunter
gatherers? No, not really. I mean,

1539
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:42,770
that's higher than me. Uh, hang
around. Bless me. Ask you this.

1540
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,460
How have you had your body
fatness measured? What amount?

1541
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:47,750
A measured a bunch of ways.
Electricity.

1542
01:36:47,751 --> 01:36:51,350
I've added this machine where
you hold onto these things.

1543
01:36:51,351 --> 01:36:56,351
Just stand on this platform
and the physician's office of,

1544
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:00,290
okay, so I'm with calipers the most. Okay.

1545
01:37:00,291 --> 01:37:03,770
So all the methods that you measure
that you mentioned are not gold standard

1546
01:37:03,771 --> 01:37:04,550
methods.

1547
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:08,720
So the gold standard methods
are underwater weighing
and the underwater weighing

1548
01:37:08,721 --> 01:37:12,380
these people on this island.
Uh, actually I'm not sure.

1549
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:16,850
I'm not sure how to bring that equipment
to this island. Correct. But okay, look,

1550
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:20,840
um, I can tell you that you can look
up photos. I don't remember how they,

1551
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:25,340
how they measured their body fat, but you
can look, I am 12% as measured by Dexa.

1552
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:30,050
So I'll just tell you that so you can
get a sense of what 12% is by Dexa.

1553
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:35,420
Um, which is a gold standard method. Um,
so you can look at photos of these people.

1554
01:37:35,421 --> 01:37:38,150
They're very fit. They're lean,
they're not like ripped, you know,

1555
01:37:38,151 --> 01:37:41,000
they're not Arnold Schwartz and
Egger and peak form, but they are,

1556
01:37:41,110 --> 01:37:41,691
I understand it,

1557
01:37:41,691 --> 01:37:46,691
but it seems to correlate with a higher
consumption of sugar that they seem to

1558
01:37:46,881 --> 01:37:49,610
have a higher percentage of body fat
than the average hunter gatherer.

1559
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:52,220
Now you look at a lot of the
average a hundred gatherers,

1560
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:56,200
like a friend of mine does a lot
of work with the pygmies and uh,

1561
01:37:56,430 --> 01:38:00,360
the Congo and they've very lean.
Okay, so you see him sees packs.

1562
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:04,570
That's the second culture. I was going to
cite that Ethan kind of honey, do they?

1563
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:08,830
Yeah. If they're the same ones and
little booty pygmies of the Congo,

1564
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:10,270
um,

1565
01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:15,110
they eat up to 80% of their calories can
come from honey during the rainy season.

1566
01:38:15,111 --> 01:38:20,110
So they also eat a lot of honey and our
lean not just leave the year. Correct.

1567
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,640
Yeah, it's for them.
It's part of the year.

1568
01:38:21,641 --> 01:38:26,260
The Hadza that you did more consistently
and the Hadza have low levels of body

1569
01:38:26,261 --> 01:38:29,530
fat. Their cardiovascular
risk markers are excellent.

1570
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,650
They don't have diabetes.
Same.

1571
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:35,920
But this is absolutely not like a
controlled study in the consumption. Not,

1572
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:38,050
I absolutely agree with you.

1573
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:43,180
And that's exactly the point I'm trying
to make is that when you have a culture

1574
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:46,930
that is eating a lot of sugar,
but everything else is in place,

1575
01:38:46,931 --> 01:38:50,530
they're doing everything else right.
The sugar's not enough to make them fat.

1576
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,550
It's not single handedly enough.
I'm not saying it doesn't contribute.

1577
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:57,760
I think sugar does contribute.
I just to be very clear,

1578
01:38:58,030 --> 01:39:02,500
I think sugar does contribute to obesity
and diabetes and cardiovascular disease,

1579
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:06,490
but it's not single handedly
responsible as Gary has argued.

1580
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:09,280
So the third culture
is pretty interesting.

1581
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:14,310
The Kuna of Panama and the reason
they're interesting is that they actually

1582
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:17,650
aren't eating honey.
They're actually eating white sugar.

1583
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:22,960
So there a culture that they live
primarily a nonindustrial lifestyle.

1584
01:39:22,961 --> 01:39:26,940
They're farmers and
hunter gatherers and um,

1585
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,420
they,

1586
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:32,620
but they do a little bit of trade and
one of the things they trade for us sugar

1587
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:35,650
and they eat sugar
sweetened foods as well.

1588
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:39,790
So like donuts and pastries and
they drink soda and Koolaid. What,

1589
01:39:39,791 --> 01:39:43,240
what is their lifestyle in terms of like
what do they have a natural lifestyle.

1590
01:39:43,241 --> 01:39:47,620
They are a hunter gatherers and
subsistence farmers. So they're, you know,

1591
01:39:47,621 --> 01:39:50,290
living a physically active,
natural lifestyle

1592
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:55,700
problem and comparison with
any westernized civilization
that you burn off.

1593
01:39:55,701 --> 01:39:58,040
Sold many more cow.

1594
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:01,890
100% agree with you.
And I think that is exactly the point.

1595
01:40:01,891 --> 01:40:05,910
I'm trying to make is that it's
more complicated than just sugar

1596
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:08,140
is more complicated than
that and just sugar,

1597
01:40:08,141 --> 01:40:11,830
but with a normal lifestyle it may not be.

1598
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:14,500
This is I the consumption,

1599
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:18,060
the thing about burning of
the calories is also the, the,

1600
01:40:18,061 --> 01:40:21,580
the glucose demands a glycogen
demands on the muscle. You're, you're,

1601
01:40:21,581 --> 01:40:24,580
you're not just existing like the Wa,

1602
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:28,720
one of the problems with Western lifestyle
is that many people are just existing.

1603
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:31,660
They're sitting in a chair,
they're walking to a desk,

1604
01:40:31,661 --> 01:40:32,830
they're sitting in their car,

1605
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:37,360
they're not doing anything to burn any
of this shit off. So even if you have,

1606
01:40:37,361 --> 01:40:40,450
like if you get a baseline of a minimal
amount of calories that you require for

1607
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:45,070
the day, I think what Gary's
getting at is that if you,

1608
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:49,720
if you have this lifestyle,
the lifestyle that many of us have,

1609
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:54,940
and then with that lifestyle consume
sugar that you're going to get fat.

1610
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:59,500
I don't think you can compare that
to athletes. And in that respect,

1611
01:40:59,501 --> 01:41:02,320
I don't think you can compare that
to a hunter gatherers because you're

1612
01:41:02,321 --> 01:41:06,820
requiring, it is a much more
significant load on your body.

1613
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:11,560
Like when I do this sober October
fitness challenge with my friends during

1614
01:41:11,561 --> 01:41:12,940
October and we,

1615
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:16,990
I was working out four hours a day and
I was fucking eating everything that

1616
01:41:16,991 --> 01:41:21,490
moved. I was drinking soda. I never
drink soda. I was eating cookies.

1617
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:26,050
I didn't gain any weight other than
muscle. I didn't get any fat at all. Yeah.

1618
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:30,040
And I was eating a terrible fucking die,
but I was going crazy.

1619
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:35,370
When you're trying to stay alive and
you're running around plowing and growing

1620
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:40,240
foods and hunting and
gathering and fishing,

1621
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:44,320
you're burning off insane amounts of
calories. Just the hiking that's required,

1622
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,510
the amount of exercise it's required.

1623
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:50,010
It's off the charts in comparison
to standard western life.

1624
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:52,310
We are on the same wavelength here.
I mean,

1625
01:41:52,311 --> 01:41:56,930
I completely agree with you that it is
more complicated than just sugar. And,

1626
01:41:57,020 --> 01:42:01,310
but if you read what Gary is written,
and please correct me if I'm wrong here,

1627
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:06,740
Gary argues that sugar is the primary
cause of obesity and that physical

1628
01:42:06,741 --> 01:42:10,430
activity does not matter. Calorie
intake. Does it not matter?

1629
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:15,290
Do you think the physical activity doesn't
matter? Uh, I think it's a, uh, uh,

1630
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:16,341
no,

1631
01:42:16,341 --> 01:42:19,490
I don't think it makes a hell of a lot
of difference for fat when we're talking

1632
01:42:19,491 --> 01:42:20,660
about the cause of obesity.

1633
01:42:20,661 --> 01:42:23,180
I don't believe obese people get
obese because they're suddenly,

1634
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:24,380
well let me put it this way.

1635
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:29,640
So you take someone who's an elite
athlete and they start consuming a lot of

1636
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:34,480
sugar, but they, they ramp up
their exercise accordingly.

1637
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:37,750
Like say if someone does what
I did during the sober October,

1638
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:40,120
they're working out three,
four hours a day every day.

1639
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,980
You don't think that they have higher
sugar demands that their body would just

1640
01:42:44,981 --> 01:42:45,430
burn it.

1641
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:48,240
I know, absolutely. I think that if
there's a real benefit to exercise,

1642
01:42:48,241 --> 01:42:53,190
it's burning off the carbohydrates you
consume then and you need less insulin to

1643
01:42:53,191 --> 01:42:57,660
do it. Can I respond to the Kona?
Get back to them for a second. Okay.

1644
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,840
I mean one of the issues I have with
Stephen as he writes off my stories,

1645
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:04,201
his stories,

1646
01:43:04,201 --> 01:43:08,640
which they are all science
began to stories on hypotheses.

1647
01:43:08,641 --> 01:43:12,330
And then what you'd do is go look for
the evidence and then he quotes studies

1648
01:43:12,331 --> 01:43:13,790
and refers to what has happened.

1649
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,700
And this is somehow by
calling it evidence that may,

1650
01:43:17,701 --> 01:43:21,060
and then we had this discussion a year
and a half ago and you didn't disagree

1651
01:43:21,061 --> 01:43:23,430
with me at the time and
it had no influence.

1652
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:27,360
So I'm just going to read from
the email I wrote to second.

1653
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,780
It's creating emails. It's gotten to that
point in the conversation at deed it.

1654
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:36,490
Well, because it's, I'm not only going
to read from the email if I have time,

1655
01:43:36,491 --> 01:43:39,000
I'm going to read from
your book read the Kuna.

1656
01:43:39,001 --> 01:43:41,070
The study you cited is interesting.
Okay.

1657
01:43:41,071 --> 01:43:45,780
So this was a study that profess to
measure sugar intake of this population on

1658
01:43:45,781 --> 01:43:50,781
an island and the Gandhi and compare it
to the population in Vera where they,

1659
01:43:51,891 --> 01:43:55,250
uh,
they had emigrated and I say,

1660
01:43:55,251 --> 01:43:59,570
but there added sugar and take an alta
according to figure one is 25 teaspoons

1661
01:43:59,571 --> 01:44:03,710
per week, plus the equivalent of
24 ounces of Sodas at 78 grams.

1662
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:07,340
If it's coke 32 ounces of Koolaid,
that's 96 grams,

1663
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:11,210
said I'm leaving out the cup of a sugar
cane because I don't know what that has

1664
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:15,010
meant or how they assess it one way or
the other. It's not processed sugar.

1665
01:44:15,011 --> 01:44:20,011
So it's roughly 274 grams of sugar
per week or about 32 pounds per year.

1666
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:21,741
Now,

1667
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:24,890
that alone is very low intake and we
don't know how it changed over the years.

1668
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:27,770
We have no idea if it's increasing
recently or been low for years.

1669
01:44:27,771 --> 01:44:28,880
So you just used the coon.

1670
01:44:28,881 --> 01:44:32,930
That's an example of a population
that eats a lot of sugar and stated at

1671
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:37,490
dogmatically, but that a lot of sugars,
32 pounds a year. And then I said, wait,

1672
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:41,390
hold on. I thought
that's what I heard. Uh,

1673
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:42,650
if we believe the study,

1674
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:46,190
the Coonan Vera Cruz are consuming
roughly the same amount, but I'm not sure.

1675
01:44:46,191 --> 01:44:49,190
I believe the study when it comes
to the Vera Cruz population,

1676
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:52,940
do you really think these urbanized
coon are consuming only three,

1677
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:54,470
eight ounce sodas per week?

1678
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:59,740
So the implication was as population of
Caribbean islanders immigrates to Vera

1679
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:00,141
Cruz,

1680
01:45:00,141 --> 01:45:04,700
they move into the city and they consume
more sugar back where they used to live

1681
01:45:04,701 --> 01:45:08,440
because they trade for it. Then
when they get into the city, um,

1682
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:12,260
so five glasses of Koolaid, no
candy, no ice cream, nothing.

1683
01:45:12,261 --> 01:45:15,920
I'd like to know more about the urban
CUNA before I accept such an analysis is

1684
01:45:15,921 --> 01:45:17,780
valid on top of this.
As they say,

1685
01:45:17,781 --> 01:45:20,690
the analysis is done mostly
of women because quote,

1686
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:23,930
the women were available to study because
they were at home during the day on

1687
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:24,770
quote.

1688
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:27,770
So what were the men consuming and what
were the children consuming when they

1689
01:45:27,771 --> 01:45:31,730
weren't at home and was there something
magical about this freak food frequency

1690
01:45:31,731 --> 01:45:34,730
questionnaire and these researchers
that they captured it accurately.

1691
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:38,750
So this is what scientists, you
have studies, you have evidence in.

1692
01:45:38,751 --> 01:45:41,450
The question always is you've
got competing hypothesis.

1693
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:44,390
Does this evidence really
speak to the hypothesis?

1694
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,340
And I'm one of my issues with Steven,

1695
01:45:46,341 --> 01:45:51,341
it's what provoked aren't our initial
discord is that he's constantly citing

1696
01:45:51,351 --> 01:45:52,700
studies that don't actually,

1697
01:45:52,701 --> 01:45:57,701
either they only speak to one hypothesis
like the overfeeding study or they're

1698
01:45:58,731 --> 01:46:00,530
poorly constructed and poorly done.

1699
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:05,530
So even this hazed example with the
honey is something we discussed an email

1700
01:46:05,541 --> 01:46:07,640
very kindly and we went
back and forth and I said,

1701
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:11,960
I don't actually think it's a reputation
because the hypothesis I'm defending

1702
01:46:11,961 --> 01:46:12,291
here,

1703
01:46:12,291 --> 01:46:17,090
the case against sugar is you
add sugar to any populations,

1704
01:46:17,091 --> 01:46:21,020
native diet, and you get
epidemics of obesity and diabetes.

1705
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:25,700
So here's a population that's been eating
honey for maybe thousands of years.

1706
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,490
In fact,
when they emigrated to this area,

1707
01:46:28,491 --> 01:46:33,170
they may have added honey to their
diet and had obesity and diabetes.

1708
01:46:33,171 --> 01:46:34,790
Then in the Steven points out in the book,

1709
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:38,300
obesity and diabetes in a
hunter gatherer populations,

1710
01:46:38,301 --> 01:46:41,600
a death sentence for the child and
for the mother who gives birth.

1711
01:46:41,601 --> 01:46:44,630
So you're going to very quickly
weed out anyone. So again,

1712
01:46:44,631 --> 01:46:47,570
it just comes back to this question
of does this actually does,

1713
01:46:47,571 --> 01:46:48,980
is it a refutation?

1714
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:53,670
The hypothesis that I found
a hunter gatherer or a
population that eats a lot of

1715
01:46:53,671 --> 01:46:58,500
honey and is in fat. And the answer is I
don't think so. Stephen thinks it does.

1716
01:46:58,501 --> 01:47:02,100
You could flip a coin. All of this
can be settled with experiments.

1717
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,750
One of the experiments we did it no city,
uh,

1718
01:47:06,751 --> 01:47:11,751
so one of the metabolic problems that
goes along with obesity and diabetes is

1719
01:47:12,421 --> 01:47:15,840
non alcoholic fatty liver disease.
It's endemic.

1720
01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:18,570
It used to be 20 years ago,
if he had alcoholic fatty,

1721
01:47:18,571 --> 01:47:20,010
if he had fatty liver disease,

1722
01:47:20,011 --> 01:47:22,770
a Dr. Wood and you told the
doctor you didn't smoke,

1723
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:24,090
they would assume you were lying.

1724
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:29,130
Now it's so common and
so common in children and
particularly common in Hispanic

1725
01:47:29,131 --> 01:47:33,720
children. They a that it's clear
it's not caused by alcohol.

1726
01:47:33,721 --> 01:47:35,210
And the question is what causes it?

1727
01:47:35,211 --> 01:47:39,200
Cause if you could create a fatty
liver with the macronutrient,

1728
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:42,270
you could probably create
insulin resistance as well.

1729
01:47:42,271 --> 01:47:46,050
And then this whole slew of disorders
including obesity and diabetes.

1730
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:51,290
So my non for profit funded a pilot
study where we just took 40 cared by the

1731
01:47:51,721 --> 01:47:56,530
researchers at UC San Diego and
at Emory university in Atlanta.

1732
01:47:56,531 --> 01:48:01,531
It took 40 kids who had nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease and randomized them

1733
01:48:01,981 --> 01:48:05,340
into two groups and one group.
We gave them the entire family,

1734
01:48:05,341 --> 01:48:08,790
all the food they need it so they
could overeat to their heart's extent,

1735
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,380
but no added sugars in their
diet and no sugary beverages.

1736
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:17,240
And this study was published in Jama
four months ago and it's just it

1737
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:23,250
get rid of the sugar in the Diet. The
fatty liver disease resolves, you know,

1738
01:48:23,251 --> 01:48:26,670
it was pretty simple.
I could tells you nothing about mechanism.

1739
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:30,300
The kids lost a little bit of weight.
Maybe it was a weight loss.

1740
01:48:30,301 --> 01:48:33,510
The conventional wisdom
would be they just ate less,

1741
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:36,540
which I wouldn't be at all surprised
because they probably didn't like the food

1742
01:48:36,541 --> 01:48:37,890
as much without sugar in it.

1743
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:43,610
But these are the kinds of ways you could
test these hypotheses and problems I

1744
01:48:44,311 --> 01:48:47,550
have with like the met analysis,
getting back to Kevin and hall,

1745
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:50,010
there's two ways you could do science.
You could say,

1746
01:48:50,011 --> 01:48:54,450
let's look at all the junk that
was done for 30 40, 50 years.

1747
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:55,950
Let's find everything we can.

1748
01:48:55,951 --> 01:49:00,951
That even vaguely speaks to the experiment
and ignore any quality of the study.

1749
01:49:01,711 --> 01:49:03,510
So if it may be asked,

1750
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:07,290
it asks this question like we want to
know what happens when people do this.

1751
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:10,440
But in doing this, we
switched there, you know,

1752
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:15,920
fat intake around fat and carbon take
around and then we can throw all that

1753
01:49:16,201 --> 01:49:18,390
garbage into a Meta analysis.

1754
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:22,440
And the one thing I'm pretty competent
as they did a poor job because of one

1755
01:49:22,441 --> 01:49:26,970
study I looked up the one with the biggest
effect they mistook Hila Jewel's for

1756
01:49:26,971 --> 01:49:28,050
kilocalories.

1757
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:33,380
So they reported that 400 kilo calorie
decrease in energy expenditure on the low

1758
01:49:34,561 --> 01:49:38,640
fat diet and one was a 400 kilo joule,
which is, what's that factor? You know,

1759
01:49:38,641 --> 01:49:43,120
these numbers, uh, 0.8 0.18 or something.

1760
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:45,780
Several of the other studies
where Jim Hill Studies,

1761
01:49:45,781 --> 01:49:49,810
we've talked about Jim how biggest studies
or Jen now and the way we approached

1762
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:53,740
it, the non-for-profits say you've got
understand what the question is and you've

1763
01:49:53,741 --> 01:49:56,470
got to design an experiment
to get the right answer.

1764
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:58,930
So when Stephen Dismiss

1765
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:00,910
this Harvard three names for him now,

1766
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:06,280
what Stephan's to fall his DNA,
right?

1767
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:10,580
Dr Ghana, can I step to the named
Stephanie? It's really easy to find.

1768
01:50:10,630 --> 01:50:15,500
I can't do it. Do it. I just don't
get names. My name's Joe. All right,

1769
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,820
Gary, that I know. I do the, um,

1770
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,870
Stephan,
uh,

1771
01:50:21,930 --> 01:50:26,930
ultimately rejected this study is about
a $12 million study that was done at

1772
01:50:28,171 --> 01:50:31,980
Harvard based on Kevin Hall.
So these are two names.

1773
01:50:31,981 --> 01:50:36,981
It's about three people out there who
are convinced that everything people like

1774
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:39,960
me are saying is wrong or not
everything but most of it.

1775
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,870
And they keep coming up over
and over again. And they would,

1776
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:48,050
so Kevin Hall claims that he has refuted
the carbohydrate insulin model in his

1777
01:50:49,081 --> 01:50:52,650
studies.
So when a study comes out supporting it,

1778
01:50:52,651 --> 01:50:56,490
he works to find out why that studies
wrong. We all did the same thing.

1779
01:50:56,491 --> 01:51:00,180
I did the same thing right here with the
Kuna study explaining why I don't find

1780
01:51:00,181 --> 01:51:02,100
it meaningful. But
anyway, that's the thing.

1781
01:51:02,430 --> 01:51:05,940
The goal was to do the right study cause
ultimately you got to remember what's

1782
01:51:05,941 --> 01:51:08,820
on the line here.
We have obesity and diabetes epidemics.

1783
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:13,230
I mean tragic shit is going on out
there. I mean people, you know,

1784
01:51:13,231 --> 01:51:16,980
these are ruining lives. There are
overwhelming the healthcare system.

1785
01:51:17,490 --> 01:51:20,820
And the argument I made is
that for the past 50 years,

1786
01:51:20,821 --> 01:51:25,821
basically people have thought a lot like
Stephan is thinking now Dr Dna and that

1787
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:32,310
there appears to be another story that
could be true and when we have to do is

1788
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:34,280
find out if it is true
because people are dying now.

1789
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,960
Stuff. Okay. Um,

1790
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:42,240
the first thing I want to say is that
this alternative explanation that Gary is

1791
01:51:42,491 --> 01:51:45,760
talking about has already
been investigated intensively,

1792
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:49,420
including studies that were
funded by his own organization,

1793
01:51:49,421 --> 01:51:53,620
new c two out of the three studies
that have been published on that.

1794
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:57,820
We're clear reputations on
hypothesis and no, no, no.

1795
01:51:57,821 --> 01:52:01,300
I'm gonna responded here. No, no. I
know you've got to raise that the study,

1796
01:52:01,450 --> 01:52:02,800
correct. Gary, Gary, Gary,

1797
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:07,060
I representing them according
to your beliefs is not
representing them correctly.

1798
01:52:07,061 --> 01:52:07,894
Okay.

1799
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:13,050
Now I've noticed a remarkable correlation
between studies undermining your

1800
01:52:13,271 --> 01:52:17,570
beliefs and you thinking those studies
are garbage and we should talk about, uh,

1801
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:20,840
Jim Hill and his studies a
little bit because, you know,

1802
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:25,660
to me just saying this guy has a conflict
of interest and then insinuating that

1803
01:52:25,661 --> 01:52:29,440
that makes the study bad if you can't
actually find a problem with the study

1804
01:52:29,441 --> 01:52:32,710
itself. These were very rigorous
studies if you cannot point out,

1805
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:36,850
I see the problem with the study,
it was designed with an assumption.

1806
01:52:37,090 --> 01:52:40,690
It was designed based on the assumption
it suppose it wasn't designed how Gary

1807
01:52:40,691 --> 01:52:42,520
wanted it to be designed.
Um,

1808
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:46,610
if you cannot find a
problem with that study,

1809
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:52,370
then you can't just dismiss it by making
these insinuations that the person had

1810
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:56,900
a conflict of interest. Okay. I now into
the problem. Okay, that's great Gary.

1811
01:52:57,110 --> 01:53:00,730
Now Harry on it at the time.
All right.

1812
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:05,150
You're going to be able to respond
in a moment. Now I'm the Cuna.

1813
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:08,600
I think we should really get back to
this issue, this nonindustrial culture,

1814
01:53:08,601 --> 01:53:13,160
because the primary basis for Gary's book,

1815
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:14,330
the case against sugar,

1816
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:18,170
the primary observation
that underlies gears,

1817
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:23,171
belief on this is this observational
correlational thing that cultures,

1818
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:28,550
when sugar gets into these cultures,

1819
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:32,750
they become fat and that is the
common thread and in obesity,

1820
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:37,780
and so what I'm doing is I'm pointing
out a culture where sugar came in and it

1821
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:41,030
did not make them fat and
that's one of three cultures.

1822
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:42,650
I haven't even looked that hard.
Okay.

1823
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:47,270
These are just three cultures that I
came across is probably a bunch more that

1824
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,070
are eating high levels of sugar,

1825
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:53,630
but they're 800 [inaudible] to our hobbies
and I think a is the same. And again,

1826
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:56,930
Joe explanation is right on point.

1827
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,200
There's a lot of other things going
on in these cultures and it's more

1828
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:02,660
complicated than just sugar.
That's exactly my point.

1829
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,990
Now I want to talk about
the Cuban economic crisis.

1830
01:54:05,991 --> 01:54:10,991
This is reference number 22 from 1989
through 1995 the Cuban economy collapsed

1831
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:19,130
and the price of food went way up.
The price of gasoline went way up.

1832
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:22,970
And so people started focusing
on these really cheap foods.

1833
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:29,240
Cuba was a major sugar producer at the
time. I don't know if they still are.

1834
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:31,820
And so the intake of sugar went way up.

1835
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:34,580
Intake of refined
carbohydrate went way up.

1836
01:54:34,970 --> 01:54:38,900
The Diet became a 77% carbohydrate,

1837
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:41,060
primarily white rice and sugar,

1838
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:44,690
28% sugar of their total calorie intake.

1839
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:46,700
So that's like double what Americans eat.

1840
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:52,130
Now their calorie intake went down
and because of the lack of gasoline,

1841
01:54:52,131 --> 01:54:55,820
people got really physically active
because they had to walk everywhere.

1842
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:58,940
So now again,
if this is,

1843
01:54:58,941 --> 01:55:03,620
this is a situation where we
can test Gary's hypothesis.

1844
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:06,050
If Gary is right and
calories don't matter,

1845
01:55:06,051 --> 01:55:08,240
only refined carbohydrate
and sugar matter,

1846
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:12,470
obesity should have gone through the roof
in this population over that period of

1847
01:55:12,471 --> 01:55:13,304
time.

1848
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:17,900
What you actually see is that the
prevalence of obesity declined by half.

1849
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:20,840
So there was a 50% decline.

1850
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:25,430
It went from 14% to 7% over
the period of this. Um,

1851
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:29,870
increase in sugar intake,
increase in refined carbohydrate intake.

1852
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,041
And you might think,

1853
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:34,760
well these people are just starving like
crazy and that's why obesity rate went

1854
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:39,650
down. Well, we actually have evidence
on the rate of underweight as well.

1855
01:55:39,651 --> 01:55:40,910
And so we can check on that.

1856
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:44,910
The rate of underweight
increased only slightly,

1857
01:55:44,911 --> 01:55:47,070
it went from 8% to 10%.

1858
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:51,240
And so we know these people
weren't just totally starving. Um,

1859
01:55:51,630 --> 01:55:54,570
and what happened then
was as the Diet rebounded,

1860
01:55:54,571 --> 01:55:59,160
as the economy rebounded in the diet
rebounded and their diet shifted away from

1861
01:55:59,161 --> 01:56:03,060
these refined carbohydrates and sugar
and back to the normal diet that was

1862
01:56:03,061 --> 01:56:07,050
higher in, uh, in fats and lower
in carbohydrate, lower in sugar,

1863
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:10,740
the obesity rate went right back up as
soon as they went back to their normal

1864
01:56:10,741 --> 01:56:15,330
diet. And so I find this cause there were,
there were not walking as much. Yeah,

1865
01:56:15,331 --> 01:56:18,690
I was an exercise and also just their
diet became richer again. I mean,

1866
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:21,360
if you're eating a diet
that's a very poor diet,

1867
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:25,230
eating like white rice and sugar,
I mean it,

1868
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:28,570
it's not like if that's most of what if,

1869
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:31,890
if you're sitting there and on your
plate is a white rice and sugar,

1870
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:35,760
you're not going to be eating a ton of
that and getting fat as opposed to eating

1871
01:56:35,761 --> 01:56:39,470
a rich diet with more
varied foods. And so, um,

1872
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:43,920
this is a case where you have an entire
country testing Gary's hypothesis and

1873
01:56:43,921 --> 01:56:48,570
finding that basically the opposite
of what his hypothesis predicts.

1874
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:50,303
Yeah.

1875
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:52,210
Uh, let's go with the, the, the,

1876
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:54,350
when he was refuting the
studies and you want to go,

1877
01:56:54,351 --> 01:56:57,680
but this was a level of this course I
don't even really want to get into because

1878
01:56:57,681 --> 01:56:59,660
that's a study that I'm going
to have to read. He's right.

1879
01:56:59,661 --> 01:57:01,900
I'm gonna read it to try and
figure out what the problem is.

1880
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:06,390
I remember looking at that study and
thinking there wasn't the kind of day to

1881
01:57:06,391 --> 01:57:09,110
your side and maybe there's
multiple studies put together,

1882
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:12,440
but the one study I looked at, the kind
of day two you're citing wasn't in there.

1883
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:17,390
That this is again a preferences are on
my website. So have at it. No I will,

1884
01:57:17,391 --> 01:57:21,530
but we'll be off the air by
then. Um, the beginning of his,

1885
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:22,760
when he started talking,

1886
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:26,270
who's referencing some studies
and you had a problem with that?

1887
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:30,710
Well there's this whole, it's
a game. People plan again,

1888
01:57:30,711 --> 01:57:33,470
it's why basically in my
book I try not to get into,

1889
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:36,560
he said she said studies cause
you never know how well they did.

1890
01:57:36,561 --> 01:57:41,000
I think we both agreed that there's
a reproducibility crisis in science.

1891
01:57:41,001 --> 01:57:45,290
It's some huge proportion of the
studies are just raw on whether their

1892
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:49,820
experiments or observations.
People sometimes aren't
very good at what they do.

1893
01:57:49,970 --> 01:57:54,140
Right. And so anyone in either business,
you have to, Steven likes to say,

1894
01:57:54,141 --> 01:57:56,600
I have no evidence,
nothing dammit.

1895
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:02,020
But simultaneously people accuse me of
writing a 600 page book with 150 pages of

1896
01:58:03,051 --> 01:58:04,760
references.
I was too long to read.

1897
01:58:05,150 --> 01:58:08,960
So there's clearly evidence for this
observation and this hypothesis.

1898
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:10,940
My issue with Stephan

1899
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:17,560
is had he speaks as though he knows
what this authority and so again,

1900
01:58:17,601 --> 01:58:21,500
I would like to just read a little bit
from your book because as I was prepping

1901
01:58:21,501 --> 01:58:23,300
for this, that was for
you do that though. The,

1902
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:28,100
he was referencing Cuban situation.
I don't know what the reality for that.

1903
01:58:28,130 --> 01:58:30,290
Before that, when, when
you first started talking,

1904
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:35,000
he was referencing things that you
were stating that he was saying.

1905
01:58:35,001 --> 01:58:37,230
What were you saying?
That uh, th th th the,

1906
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:42,360
the organization that supports him
actually refuted Jim Hill Studies,

1907
01:58:42,450 --> 01:58:46,480
the Jim Hill, the, uh, the new c studies.
And now we're talking about the nuisance,

1908
01:58:47,230 --> 01:58:50,740
the first two of which, and we can
get, we can get into detail on this,

1909
01:58:50,741 --> 01:58:53,290
on how those refuted Gary's, uh, beliefs.

1910
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:56,590
And I would say Gary is about the only
person who thinks that they did not

1911
01:58:56,591 --> 01:59:00,940
refuse just beliefs. The scientific
community is pretty unanimous,

1912
01:59:01,090 --> 01:59:05,740
can respond. But could you please say
what was, what would the study stayed on?

1913
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:09,070
Let me do it before he did the first study

1914
01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:13,440
as a pilot study. That uh,

1915
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:18,180
depends what you look at to depend
whether or not it refuted your beliefs.

1916
01:59:18,181 --> 01:59:20,240
So there again,
you have to understand this world.

1917
01:59:20,270 --> 01:59:23,240
There are researchers
who believe one thing,

1918
01:59:23,241 --> 01:59:27,710
Kevin Hall and Nih tends to believe that
obesity is an energy balance problem

1919
01:59:27,711 --> 01:59:32,480
and you people get fat because I ate too
much. I hope I'm doing Kevin Justice.

1920
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:33,260
Um,

1921
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:37,610
and then there's David Ludwig and his
colleagues at Harvard who tend to believe

1922
01:59:37,611 --> 01:59:42,611
what I believe and we funded them both
to do studies and Kevin Hall study.

1923
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:46,800
Uh,
if you believe what Kevin,

1924
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:50,750
if you believe Kevin
interpreted it correctly, uh,

1925
01:59:50,751 --> 01:59:53,690
was not supportive of this model,

1926
01:59:53,691 --> 01:59:58,370
that carbohydrates are ultimately driving
insulin and insulin is driving up fat

1927
01:59:58,371 --> 02:00:01,850
accumulation. And the
David Ludwig Study, uh,

1928
02:00:03,170 --> 02:00:04,900
reported the opposite.
And,

1929
02:00:04,901 --> 02:00:09,890
and David has criticized Kevin Study
and Kevin has criticized David study.

1930
02:00:09,891 --> 02:00:13,070
And this is the nature of science.
This is what you do in science.

1931
02:00:13,071 --> 02:00:16,970
You do an experiment, people critique
it. Ideally you do another one.

1932
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:20,780
Kevin has decided, well, Kevin
is doing it. Another one,

1933
02:00:20,781 --> 02:00:22,460
I think he's asking the wrong questions,

1934
02:00:22,461 --> 02:00:25,970
but what I just saw the other day that
he's doing another experiment. Um,

1935
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:32,030
today the middle study was a tree living
diet study where a done by Christopher

1936
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:38,380
Gardner at Stanford University and the
idea was a original idea was 600 people

1937
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:45,040
randomized to either a very
low carbohydrate diet or a
very low fat diet and we

1938
02:00:45,771 --> 02:00:50,690
funded it in part because we hoped that
Christopher would be able to get people

1939
02:00:50,691 --> 02:00:54,020
to almost a ketogenic diet
on that low carb side.

1940
02:00:54,021 --> 02:00:58,850
And Dean Ornish who promotes a low fat
diet always complained that the low fat

1941
02:00:58,851 --> 02:00:59,141
diet,

1942
02:00:59,141 --> 02:01:03,350
it wasn't fast enough so hopefully
they'd be able to separate out these two.

1943
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:04,623
Um,

1944
02:01:06,290 --> 02:01:10,960
at the end of the trial they
got pretty lousy adherence.

1945
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:14,780
A low carb was about 25 to 28% carb,

1946
02:01:14,781 --> 02:01:17,190
which is by no means a low meaning,
pretty typical,

1947
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:22,320
pretty typical in free living studies.
And the low fat was about equal. Um,

1948
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,230
what they did,
which it's funny,

1949
02:01:24,231 --> 02:01:27,540
we've analyzed this on one
side but not the other. Um,

1950
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:33,170
they told the low carb group not
to eat sugars and refined grains,

1951
02:01:33,171 --> 02:01:38,060
which are by my hypothesis the
most fattening carbohydrates.

1952
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:43,090
And they also told the low fat group to
Nati refined sugars and refined grains.

1953
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:49,960
So they basically removed
the most fattening parts of
the Diet from both arms of

1954
02:01:50,331 --> 02:01:51,141
the study.
It's funny,

1955
02:01:51,141 --> 02:01:53,870
we knew that we're going to do with
the low carb group cause you have to,

1956
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:56,990
and my colleagues actually knew they
were going to do with the low fat group.

1957
02:01:56,991 --> 02:01:57,741
I didn't know that.

1958
02:01:57,741 --> 02:02:01,610
When I found out I was stunned
because now you're testing two diets.

1959
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,860
Neither one of them have
sugar or white bread.

1960
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:09,490
So now you see similar weight loss
with relatively poor compliance.

1961
02:02:09,911 --> 02:02:13,740
Why would they do that? That doesn't
make any sense with the argument. And we,

1962
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:16,280
we talked to Chris for
a lot of his argument.

1963
02:02:16,281 --> 02:02:20,980
He was afraid there were two things on,
he wanted the Diet to be healthy. Okay.

1964
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:26,020
So a healthy diet in 2015 has become a
diet that doesn't have sugar and white

1965
02:02:26,751 --> 02:02:27,560
bread in it.

1966
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:31,590
So he wasn't going to promote sugar and
white bread to one died or the nother,

1967
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:35,660
um, I take so long as the period of time
where they're studying these people,

1968
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:38,270
they were on the die. They were supposed
to be on the Diet for a year. Okay.

1969
02:02:38,271 --> 02:02:40,640
That makes sense. Yeah. So
that's the question is again,

1970
02:02:40,641 --> 02:02:42,200
would you expect to see a difference?

1971
02:02:42,201 --> 02:02:47,201
I can send you an email I wrote to my new
see colleagues in 2015 I could read it

1972
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,040
when I found out about this low fat thing
saying this is insane. He's removed.

1973
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:55,880
They both groups are
carbohydrate restricted.

1974
02:02:56,240 --> 02:03:00,740
So you could think of it as a low fat
carbohydrate restricted diet and a high

1975
02:03:00,741 --> 02:03:04,370
fat carbohydrate restricted diet.
And then he kinda got the same answer,

1976
02:03:04,371 --> 02:03:08,690
which could be for any reason
whatsoever. There's a paper, uh,

1977
02:03:08,691 --> 02:03:11,000
I don't know if I can, well,
I'm not going to talk about,

1978
02:03:11,001 --> 02:03:15,050
it's bad enough talking about ambiguous
studies that have been published without

1979
02:03:15,051 --> 02:03:19,790
getting into, on published research. But,
so people see this, the New York Times,

1980
02:03:19,791 --> 02:03:23,810
for instance, the two stories on it. One
of them said it's not about calories.

1981
02:03:23,811 --> 02:03:26,450
It's about the quality,
the sugar in there,

1982
02:03:26,451 --> 02:03:30,270
fine grain because both groups restricted
sugar and refined grains and loss

1983
02:03:30,271 --> 02:03:31,820
weight the other.

1984
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:35,570
And that was written by a reporter
who tends to believe what we believe.

1985
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:37,400
And the other article said,

1986
02:03:37,401 --> 02:03:41,180
it's all about the calories because both
groups ended up on average eating 500

1987
02:03:41,181 --> 02:03:42,680
calories each at the end up.

1988
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:45,530
From a scientific perspective
being a poorly done study,

1989
02:03:45,531 --> 02:03:49,460
even though we funded it, I'm not, it's
just, it didn't answer the question.

1990
02:03:49,461 --> 02:03:51,020
You said 500 calories each.

1991
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:55,980
500 heritage valley strict Calvinist
actually self reported. So it's not,

1992
02:03:55,981 --> 02:04:00,860
so it's not particularly meaningful. So
again, these are, I don't like using,

1993
02:04:00,861 --> 02:04:04,100
it's a complicated study
because it's low in sugar.

1994
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:07,190
Well and it's also free living.
Yeah. So both sides are low in sugar.

1995
02:04:07,191 --> 02:04:12,191
Both sides are not eating processed to
full differences in total carbohydrate

1996
02:04:12,471 --> 02:04:13,820
intake.
Okay.

1997
02:04:13,821 --> 02:04:18,821
So even though they were both not
eating as much refined carbohydrate,

1998
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:24,080
they were still too full differences or
greater over the period of that study in

1999
02:04:24,081 --> 02:04:25,460
total carbohydrate into,

2000
02:04:25,461 --> 02:04:28,700
if you believe the food frequency
questionnaires that you just said,

2001
02:04:28,701 --> 02:04:32,960
we don't know whether we have a, well
you could be talking about vegetables,

2002
02:04:32,961 --> 02:04:34,670
you could be talking about fruits.

2003
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:38,910
Well these are healthy carbohydrates
that they had primarily in this study.

2004
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:42,600
Can we right now we agree that that study
can be interpreted from virtually any

2005
02:04:42,601 --> 02:04:44,910
way you want it.
Especially because it was a free living.

2006
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:49,980
You don't agree with that. Um,
now, now what we will agree on,

2007
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:51,270
I'll agree with you on this,

2008
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:55,380
is that refined carbohydrates and
sugar are the most fattening type of

2009
02:04:55,381 --> 02:04:58,890
carbohydrate that we can agree on
what God, we came to an agreement.

2010
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:02,830
But the question then the question is
why is it because people eat too much of,

2011
02:05:02,850 --> 02:05:06,240
here's the thing. If you, if
you believe Gary hypothesis now,

2012
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:09,540
any kind of carbohydrate
increases insulin levels.

2013
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:13,170
Some do it more than others are
fine carbohydrates do it more.

2014
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:18,180
Any kind of carbohydrate increases
insulin levels relative to fat. Okay.

2015
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:23,630
And so if that is true and these
groups and that matters for fat loss,

2016
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:27,640
these groups had two full
differences in carbohydrate intake.

2017
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:31,560
Even though it was predominantly healthy
carbs, you would just shoot a scene,

2018
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:34,890
something you shouldn't have seen the
exact same amount of weight loss in these

2019
02:05:34,891 --> 02:05:37,680
two groups. Right? Right. But
they're not high in sugar,

2020
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:41,880
but present your argument is always there.
Part of the argument,

2021
02:05:41,881 --> 02:05:45,030
which is you take away the sugar and
that was the problem with one of the

2022
02:05:45,031 --> 02:05:48,940
problems with the ANA. Yeah. The
argument I'm making and and stuff,

2023
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:52,380
it's completely right and I'm
defending my hypothesis. Okay,

2024
02:05:52,381 --> 02:05:56,420
I see a study that he does the same
thing. He did it here. We all do it.

2025
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:58,110
You see a study that disagrees with you.

2026
02:05:58,350 --> 02:06:03,030
You find the reason why I did not believe
it in every study ever done has plenty

2027
02:06:03,031 --> 02:06:04,830
of reasons not to do
and not to believe it.

2028
02:06:04,831 --> 02:06:08,370
That's why independent replication is
something you always wanted to get another

2029
02:06:08,371 --> 02:06:11,860
group to do the study. Ideally
a third group, people come in,

2030
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:16,290
they criticized the study, then you'd
do it again and again and again. And so,

2031
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:18,210
you know what I was trying,
when we,

2032
02:06:18,211 --> 02:06:20,610
even when we started the
nutrition science initiative,

2033
02:06:20,611 --> 02:06:22,400
the choice stem is a nonprofit.

2034
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:26,310
The choice of the word initiative was to
get nutrition researchers to an effect

2035
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:29,700
s stop using these garbage,

2036
02:06:29,701 --> 02:06:34,200
poorly designed studies to
come to conclusions because
they like or dislike the

2037
02:06:34,201 --> 02:06:35,160
interpretation,

2038
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:40,230
but try to get them to think the way
harder scientists would and developing

2039
02:06:40,231 --> 02:06:43,830
studies that it asks precisely
the right question. And then the,

2040
02:06:43,831 --> 02:06:45,990
so even the pilot study that

2041
02:06:47,490 --> 02:06:52,110
was interpreted as not supporting
this hypothesis, and again,

2042
02:06:52,111 --> 02:06:55,710
you could argue that for an
hour and nobody's going to care.

2043
02:06:56,400 --> 02:07:01,080
That study was not randomized.
So non randomized study,
you can't infer causality.

2044
02:07:01,081 --> 02:07:02,940
It's that's why it was a pilot study.

2045
02:07:02,941 --> 02:07:04,860
One of the many reasons
it was a pilot study.

2046
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:07,950
The people who think
this carbohydrate model.

2047
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:10,740
So I think when we talk about
the carbohydrate incident model,

2048
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:15,540
it means carbohydrates are fattening.
That's the basis of it. Bread, pasta,

2049
02:07:15,541 --> 02:07:18,260
potato and sugar may be the,

2050
02:07:18,261 --> 02:07:22,960
the thing that's necessary to add to
the Diet to make all these carbs fat and

2051
02:07:22,961 --> 02:07:25,830
then cause sugar. As we talked
about this a year and a half ago,

2052
02:07:25,831 --> 02:07:29,730
the fructose molecule is
metabolized in the liver.

2053
02:07:29,731 --> 02:07:34,610
It's linked to fat accumulation in
the liver, which is linked to insulin.

2054
02:07:34,611 --> 02:07:37,420
And I like the way you're squeezing your
stomach fat while we're talking about

2055
02:07:37,421 --> 02:07:40,510
that matter. I got to work out dude. Um,

2056
02:07:41,950 --> 02:07:44,380
the uh, just boring, you know,

2057
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:49,520
for these experiments to be done right
there, they have to be tested, right?

2058
02:07:49,521 --> 02:07:53,560
Like you can't use pork poorly designed
experiments of poorly, you know,

2059
02:07:53,561 --> 02:07:55,000
and every experiment ever done.

2060
02:07:55,001 --> 02:07:59,230
And so what we've tried to do is keep
working towards better experiments.

2061
02:07:59,230 --> 02:08:03,650
There's now a new version of the Ludwick
experiment being done at the Arnold

2062
02:08:03,650 --> 02:08:03,970
Foundation.

2063
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:08,970
Laura and John Arnold funded to the tune
of I think 13 bill million dollars and

2064
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:15,750
whatever that study fines Kevin Hall
and we'll probably find the reason,

2065
02:08:16,181 --> 02:08:18,100
look in it and find a reason to question.

2066
02:08:18,150 --> 02:08:22,360
And ideally they would be working
together so that you come up with the

2067
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:26,860
criticisms before you've spent $13
million, but this is how science works.

2068
02:08:27,370 --> 02:08:30,790
My job was to tell a good
story is Stephanie would say,

2069
02:08:30,791 --> 02:08:34,370
and I believe people who read the books
can judge whether they're too good.

2070
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:39,340
You know, am I convincing in arguing
that the you add sugar to it,

2071
02:08:39,790 --> 02:08:41,200
counter evidence to everything.

2072
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:45,500
There wasn't counter evidence and wouldn't
require a journalist to come along in

2073
02:08:45,501 --> 02:08:46,840
20 whatever it is,

2074
02:08:46,841 --> 02:08:50,830
19 lip to make these arguments you this
because this is something that you've

2075
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:52,930
admitted to something you said rather.

2076
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:58,800
Why are sugary carbohydrates
the most fattening?

2077
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:03,010
Well,
if this hypothesis is correct,

2078
02:09:03,011 --> 02:09:08,011
I think s you would say that they
trigger our food reward or they are,

2079
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:09,641
wait,
wait,

2080
02:09:09,641 --> 02:09:14,050
let me just finish and I would say the
counter argument is that they create a

2081
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:19,570
hormonal milieu in the body that that
over responds to insulin and insulin.

2082
02:09:19,571 --> 02:09:24,571
Well we haven't said is if you look in
a textbook for fat metabolism and fatty

2083
02:09:25,681 --> 02:09:28,150
and you know what causes fat storage,

2084
02:09:28,270 --> 02:09:33,250
insulin is the hormone that
primarily regulates fat storage.

2085
02:09:33,251 --> 02:09:34,090
In your fat tail.

2086
02:09:34,091 --> 02:09:38,290
So the idea is that you raise insulin
and the sugar because of this path of it

2087
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:42,580
being fructose and that mostly being
metabolized in the small intestine in the

2088
02:09:42,581 --> 02:09:46,900
liver seems may indeed
cause insulin resistance.

2089
02:09:46,901 --> 02:09:50,890
And if it does you over respondents.
And so one is a peripheral explanation,

2090
02:09:51,010 --> 02:09:55,060
not that people don't love it and they
don't want to, you know, over consume it,

2091
02:09:55,061 --> 02:09:58,090
whatever that means.
And the other is a central explanation.

2092
02:09:59,350 --> 02:10:03,700
Yeah. So I mean sugar is a factor that
makes us want to eat foods, right?

2093
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:07,300
I mean this is one of the many food
properties I would love to talk about this

2094
02:10:07,301 --> 02:10:09,940
more.
That caused dopamine release in the brain.

2095
02:10:10,170 --> 02:10:15,170
And dopamine is a chemical that sets
our motivational levels to do certain

2096
02:10:15,431 --> 02:10:16,264
behaviors.

2097
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:20,590
So the reason we become addicted to drugs
is that they go in the brain and they

2098
02:10:20,591 --> 02:10:25,240
stimulate dopamine release and that
reinforces drug seeking behaviors. Right?

2099
02:10:25,241 --> 02:10:28,240
But this is just causing you
to consume more. Correct.

2100
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:30,400
But you're saying that the actual amount,

2101
02:10:30,930 --> 02:10:34,790
let's say if you have the same amount of
carbohydrates are sugary carbohydrates

2102
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:37,720
versus the same amount that our vegetable,
carbohydrates,

2103
02:10:37,721 --> 02:10:40,940
it sugary carbohydrates are going
to be more fattening? No, no,

2104
02:10:40,941 --> 02:10:42,920
I didn't say it was
independently of calories.

2105
02:10:42,921 --> 02:10:45,350
It's still entirely dependent
on calories. Yeah, correct.

2106
02:10:45,590 --> 02:10:48,920
And we have randomized controlled
trials, um, demonstrating that.

2107
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:52,700
So if you look at the randomized
there, by the way, we're not, uh,

2108
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:55,460
we're not operating in an evidence vacuum.

2109
02:10:55,461 --> 02:10:59,360
There's tons of randomized controlled
trials on sugar. These random,

2110
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:03,350
these randomized controlled
studies, are they short term? Um,

2111
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:07,920
it depends. Well, it depends on how you
define short term. They're not last time,

2112
02:11:07,950 --> 02:11:09,950
years and years isn't the issue though.

2113
02:11:09,951 --> 02:11:13,760
Longterm chronic effects like
that seems to be possibly,

2114
02:11:13,761 --> 02:11:17,810
but let me put it this way. You know, if
you believe that insulin is the cause,

2115
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:22,940
the effect of insulin on fat
cells happens almost immediately.

2116
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:25,370
So Insulin,
I,

2117
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:29,990
I'm not aware of any mechanism of insulin
on fat cells that takes more than a

2118
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:34,730
few hours to occur. And so if you
believe that insulin causes obesity,

2119
02:11:34,731 --> 02:11:36,260
this should be happening immediately.

2120
02:11:36,261 --> 02:11:39,760
You shouldn't have to wait months
and months for this to occur. No,

2121
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:44,220
that doesn't make any sense at all.
No, it does make sense. It makes sense.

2122
02:11:44,221 --> 02:11:47,720
It makes sense. You eat, you
eat. Does that make sense
to you? Well, because again,

2123
02:11:47,721 --> 02:11:52,250
he's, he's kind of making this up
as he goes along. So the idea is

2124
02:11:53,870 --> 02:11:57,920
we'll explain why it doesn't make sense
without consulting us as possible.

2125
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:03,110
Has he not been insulting me ever? I
might just buy us. I realized that I,

2126
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:06,980
it's everything is perspective but
necessarily saying he's insulting your

2127
02:12:06,981 --> 02:12:11,360
stories, not you personally, but
what, what, what do you, what,

2128
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:14,210
why doesn't it make sense
to you? Okay. So the idea is

2129
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:20,660
when your insulin is elevated,
you're storing fat, right? Uh,

2130
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:23,240
it depends on what you mean by that.
That's not,

2131
02:12:23,241 --> 02:12:25,460
see you do a little bit
of Bait and switch here.

2132
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:30,020
That's an intouch is to answer the
question. If it's well, it depends.

2133
02:12:30,030 --> 02:12:31,220
What do you mean by store?

2134
02:12:31,370 --> 02:12:35,210
I mean your fat cells are accumulating
fat when insulin is element.

2135
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:39,380
Do you mean accumulate? Like,
like next day you'll have to fat.

2136
02:12:39,660 --> 02:12:42,740
It inhibits, uh, uh,
yeah, that's incorrect.

2137
02:12:42,830 --> 02:12:47,600
It stimulates lipid protein lipase and
it inhibits hormone sensitive. We should,

2138
02:12:47,601 --> 02:12:51,380
we should really talk about this because
that's incorrect. It's in the textbook.

2139
02:12:51,410 --> 02:12:55,420
No. Yeah. We'll talk about what's in the
textbook. Don't worry Gary. They do says,

2140
02:12:55,850 --> 02:12:58,850
um,
okay so you don't believe it,

2141
02:12:59,230 --> 02:13:02,240
but just give me your position and
then I'll let him refute it. Uh,

2142
02:13:02,310 --> 02:13:06,350
it's here but just say it. Just
want to show it. Okay. Cause again,

2143
02:13:06,351 --> 02:13:07,790
you're going to say it's not in here.

2144
02:13:07,791 --> 02:13:11,830
So I have the same textbook
and then we'll let Joe here.

2145
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:15,380
Suppression of Fat
Mobilization by Insulin.

2146
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:20,980
And there's another graph that is
a stimulation of fat mobilization.

2147
02:13:22,521 --> 02:13:25,640
Congratulations to all of you people
that are listening to this [inaudible]

2148
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:28,180
hanging in there.
I know we're in the weird scientific,

2149
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:30,620
let me just say this is
going to take a long time.

2150
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:33,630
So we agree on the molecular mechanisms.
Okay.

2151
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,850
We agree on the molecular mechanisms,

2152
02:13:35,851 --> 02:13:39,300
the impact of insulin on
enzymes and fat cells.

2153
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:42,780
What we disagree about is
the implications of that.

2154
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:44,660
And I think that's what
we should talk about.

2155
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:49,700
It's true because nowhere in that textbook
does it say that insulin regulates

2156
02:13:50,370 --> 02:13:52,190
the total size of body fat stores.

2157
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:57,300
Absolutely guarantee that is that is
something that chemo have added onto that

2158
02:13:59,071 --> 02:14:02,520
mechanism. Would you like
to know conversation I have
with the author of, no,

2159
02:14:02,610 --> 02:14:07,320
not right now actually.
So, um, the now the,

2160
02:14:07,660 --> 02:14:10,150
now let me tell you about the
conversation. Actually Gary, let me,

2161
02:14:10,330 --> 02:14:13,440
and I should explain this for,
we talked for three hours.

2162
02:14:13,650 --> 02:14:15,990
Can you stop interrupting me please?
Okay,

2163
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:19,380
now let me explain.

2164
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:24,410
So insulin essentially does have effects
on enzymes that cause fat cells to take

2165
02:14:26,701 --> 02:14:30,250
up more fat and to release less fat. So
that's the part that you're right about.

2166
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:32,880
That's what that textbook talks about.

2167
02:14:33,330 --> 02:14:38,330
Now that does not mean that does not imply
that insulin causes fat storage as in

2168
02:14:40,381 --> 02:14:43,620
the accumulation of fat from day to day.
And let me explain why that is.

2169
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:49,040
So insulin is basically a traffic cop
that allows your body to burn the fuel

2170
02:14:49,650 --> 02:14:51,000
that you just consumed.

2171
02:14:51,810 --> 02:14:55,650
So when you eat a diet that's high
in carbohydrate and low in fat,

2172
02:14:56,040 --> 02:15:00,900
your insulin goes up, your body restricts
the fat from going out of fat cells.

2173
02:15:00,901 --> 02:15:02,910
It turns that down,
not off but down.

2174
02:15:03,390 --> 02:15:07,470
It causes less fat to come out of your
fat cells and then your body's burning

2175
02:15:07,471 --> 02:15:09,870
carbs.
That's what you just ate right now.

2176
02:15:09,871 --> 02:15:12,990
If you eat a diet that's high in
fat and lower in carbohydrate,

2177
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:14,940
you secrete less insulin.

2178
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:20,300
Those effects don't occur on your fat
cells and that allows your body to burn

2179
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:23,040
the fat that you just ate.
But at the end of the day,

2180
02:15:23,370 --> 02:15:26,490
the amount of fat that you have in
your body is the amount that you,

2181
02:15:26,491 --> 02:15:30,720
eight minus the amount that you burned.
That's what determines the amount.

2182
02:15:30,750 --> 02:15:31,800
This is just arithmetic,

2183
02:15:31,801 --> 02:15:35,070
right amount that you eight minus the
amount that you burned and if you eat a

2184
02:15:35,071 --> 02:15:37,830
low fat diet, you're not eating
much and you're not burning much.

2185
02:15:37,831 --> 02:15:42,480
You're in the same place as if you're
eating a diet where you're eating a lot of

2186
02:15:42,481 --> 02:15:44,790
fat and burning a lot of fat.

2187
02:15:44,791 --> 02:15:49,110
And the way we know that's true is
because varying the amount of carbohydrate

2188
02:15:49,111 --> 02:15:53,610
and fat in the Diet makes no difference
to body fatness in randomized controlled

2189
02:15:53,611 --> 02:15:58,260
trials. So I know that what I
just said is correct. No. So the,

2190
02:15:58,290 --> 02:16:01,950
first of all, it's one
randomized controlled trial.
Which Kevin Hall or gamma? No,

2191
02:16:01,951 --> 02:16:06,900
I'm talking about a Meta analysis
of randomized controlled trials to

2192
02:16:06,901 --> 02:16:11,210
meta-analyses. We decided
that, I think that the, Oh,

2193
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:15,600
what's wrong with men analysis from it?
He doesn't like crappy study ever done.

2194
02:16:15,630 --> 02:16:18,950
He doesn't like who did it basically.
No, no, no, no. I don't care who does it.

2195
02:16:18,951 --> 02:16:21,320
I don't like men analyses.
I don't like the concept of am.

2196
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:25,170
I think it's one of the problems with
modern nutritional and medical sciences.

2197
02:16:25,171 --> 02:16:29,710
You do crappy studies generate garbage
and then you sift through the and say,

2198
02:16:29,711 --> 02:16:30,210
I can find

2199
02:16:30,210 --> 02:16:33,600
a truth in here. And the answer
is do better. Studies, answers,

2200
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:36,670
always do better studies you
can't do, yeah, Med analyses,

2201
02:16:36,671 --> 02:16:40,120
they exist for everything.
The issue was just as a simple,

2202
02:16:40,121 --> 02:16:42,310
and remember we're talking
about the 10 calories a day.

2203
02:16:42,311 --> 02:16:46,690
So when you said the difference between
the fat burned and the fat store or the

2204
02:16:46,691 --> 02:16:50,170
fat consumed in the fat expand
that has to be 10 calories a day.

2205
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:53,770
That's that's what we're talking about.
10 calories in the fat tissue.

2206
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:55,420
Okay.

2207
02:16:55,420 --> 02:17:00,420
So if it is true that if I consume 1500
calories a day and I somehow metabolizer

2208
02:17:03,491 --> 02:17:04,660
excrete 1490,

2209
02:17:04,661 --> 02:17:09,050
and I guarantee that no such
study was ever so carefully done,

2210
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:11,990
the support this, uh,
well you could think of,

2211
02:17:11,991 --> 02:17:14,830
you're sensing the energy
balanced consortium study,

2212
02:17:14,831 --> 02:17:17,500
the Kevin Hall study that we've
talked about. One of the things,

2213
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:20,470
there are two things that happened when
you put people on a ketogenic diet,

2214
02:17:20,471 --> 02:17:21,251
among other things,

2215
02:17:21,251 --> 02:17:25,150
you generate ketones and you lose
ketones in the breadth and in the urine.

2216
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:29,470
And one of the things you have to do
in these energy balance experiments is

2217
02:17:29,471 --> 02:17:33,550
measure calories loss through
fecal material. Who knows,

2218
02:17:33,551 --> 02:17:36,550
maybe you jack up the fat consumption.

2219
02:17:36,551 --> 02:17:40,750
Maybe they lose more fat
calories when they shit it out.

2220
02:17:40,751 --> 02:17:43,240
Or maybe you set up the
five calories matter.

2221
02:17:43,810 --> 02:17:47,800
I think when you're measuring the fat
balance, which you're talking about,

2222
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:51,070
you have to measure the
amount of fat in and out.

2223
02:17:51,071 --> 02:17:54,340
And so I'm giving you an
example in response to your
question was could you give

2224
02:17:54,341 --> 02:17:57,850
me an example in that study, they
didn't do either of those measurements.

2225
02:17:57,970 --> 02:18:01,120
They modeled one and the other one,
they couldn't get the,

2226
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:05,140
the assay to work after a year
or two years and gave up on it.

2227
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:09,250
And so you just don't know.
But getting back to this question,

2228
02:18:09,251 --> 02:18:12,160
we're talking about somebody's storing
10 calories of fat and their fat cells,

2229
02:18:12,161 --> 02:18:16,420
let's never get away from that or 20
calories. And so the question is always,

2230
02:18:16,421 --> 02:18:19,000
is this mechanism,
uh,

2231
02:18:19,030 --> 02:18:22,720
capable of explaining the
20 calories or is the,

2232
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:25,570
what did you find him
looking in that book? Well,

2233
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:30,580
it's essentially what he was saying and
then sun inhibits fat mobilization from,

2234
02:18:30,730 --> 02:18:34,360
well, I can read it if you want me to
read it. You know, I mean, but I mean,

2235
02:18:34,361 --> 02:18:38,080
Gary and I both agree with
what's in that textbook.

2236
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:40,450
You can read it if you want it.
Restraints,

2237
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:44,740
fat mobilization through two mechanisms.
So suppression of light light policies,

2238
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:47,440
is that, what was that
right, yeah. Life policy.

2239
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:52,480
So mechanisms are described in the
text and the stimulation of the re

2240
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:58,310
esterification of fatty
acids within the ad,

2241
02:18:58,320 --> 02:18:59,300
a ad,

2242
02:18:59,310 --> 02:19:04,310
a pile as dining site at depth
insights at depth depth fat cells.

2243
02:19:05,110 --> 02:19:07,180
Note that the same process of uh,

2244
02:19:07,570 --> 02:19:12,520
esterification we'll
also be simultaneously
incorporated fatty acids from

2245
02:19:12,521 --> 02:19:16,850
circulating tri glycerol.

2246
02:19:16,870 --> 02:19:19,370
Glycerides. Yeah. Uh,

2247
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:22,840
triacylglycerol triacylglycerol
triacylglycerol right.

2248
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:25,690
Released by lipid protein.
Lipos

2249
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:29,110
land pays limb pays enough.
Joe [inaudible] piece. Yeah.

2250
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:34,180
L I p a s e a into stored
try ass soul glycerol.

2251
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:39,100
Yeah. So let me explain
this briefly. Big words.

2252
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:46,180
The argument I've been making and others
is that insulin inhibits fat loss.

2253
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:51,650
If you're a fat cell and you see
insulin, you hold onto your fat, right?

2254
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:56,390
It's kind of that simple. Stephan's
absolutely right. This book, which is,

2255
02:19:56,391 --> 02:19:59,990
we're talking about, is it metabolic
regulation of human perspective?

2256
02:19:59,991 --> 02:20:02,060
It's written by Keith Frane,
who's retired.

2257
02:20:02,061 --> 02:20:05,810
Oxford professor is a wonderful man and
he was the world's leading authority on

2258
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:07,220
metabolic regulation.

2259
02:20:07,221 --> 02:20:12,221
How your body controls its use of fuel
and orchestrates storage and oxidation.

2260
02:20:13,730 --> 02:20:14,900
And in this book,

2261
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:20,020
Keith Frane talks about how insulin
determines fat accumulation and fat cells.

2262
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:25,850
And this is the accumulation,
whatever, fat storage, fat storage,

2263
02:20:25,851 --> 02:20:30,560
fat try NAMIC fatty acid trafficking
in and out of fat cells. Okay,

2264
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:31,041
thank you.

2265
02:20:31,041 --> 02:20:34,460
So the first time I ever interviewed
Keith was for a piece I was doing for the

2266
02:20:34,461 --> 02:20:38,000
journal Science on a insulin resistance.

2267
02:20:38,450 --> 02:20:42,470
And we spent about an hour on the phone
and he explained to me for 20 minutes

2268
02:20:42,471 --> 02:20:43,970
all the ways insulin

2269
02:20:46,270 --> 02:20:51,270
traps the Turmans fatty acid trafficking
across the fat cell membrane.

2270
02:20:52,211 --> 02:20:56,020
And you raise until then you will
accumulate more fat on the short term.

2271
02:20:56,620 --> 02:21:00,260
And then we got to obesity and they said,
well be cities, you know, caused by a

2272
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:05,150
people eating too much. And
I said, Keith, when we were

2273
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:10,670
talking about why fat cells get
fad was all insulin mediated.

2274
02:21:11,570 --> 02:21:16,040
And when we were talking about people get
fad, it was this eating too much thing.

2275
02:21:16,910 --> 02:21:20,090
Okay.
And you switched mechanisms on me.

2276
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:25,280
So my assumption is the same reason people
get fat as the same reason their fat

2277
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:27,470
cells get fat.
And you've got a whole lot of,

2278
02:21:27,471 --> 02:21:30,260
you've got this disorder metabolic
syndrome we're talking about,

2279
02:21:30,261 --> 02:21:33,770
which includes not just uh,
uh,

2280
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:35,620
yeah,

2281
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:37,050
problems with your blood lipids,

2282
02:21:37,060 --> 02:21:40,030
but it includes getting fat
or your waistline increasing.

2283
02:21:40,031 --> 02:21:42,610
And it's an insulin
resistance related disorder,

2284
02:21:42,611 --> 02:21:45,130
which means your insulin is elevated.
And again,

2285
02:21:45,131 --> 02:21:49,300
this is where we end up with two
hypotheses about why insulin is elevated.

2286
02:21:49,660 --> 02:21:53,200
But if the friends and sugar can elevate
insulin and you end up with metabolic

2287
02:21:53,201 --> 02:21:55,270
syndrome,
you're in fat storage mode.

2288
02:21:55,271 --> 02:21:58,210
That's the terminology
of Diet book doctors.

2289
02:21:58,390 --> 02:22:02,290
So now you're storing fat and
only have to do 10 calories a day,

2290
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:04,900
20 calories a day,
you're going to get obese.

2291
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:09,040
And it's insulin mediate and insolence
responding to the carbohydrate content of

2292
02:22:09,041 --> 02:22:13,360
the Diet primarily. And that's it. And
when I said this to Keith, you know,

2293
02:22:13,361 --> 02:22:17,350
you've got one mechanism for white fat
cells get fat and a different mechanism

2294
02:22:17,351 --> 02:22:21,720
for why humans get fat. And I'd like
to talk about this over eating concept.

2295
02:22:22,050 --> 02:22:24,940
Um, he said, you know, I
never thought of that. I mean,

2296
02:22:24,941 --> 02:22:29,070
the guy had been in the field 40 years
and he let them maybe 50 and then I had a

2297
02:22:29,071 --> 02:22:30,270
long conversation with him.

2298
02:22:30,271 --> 02:22:35,271
I was back in Oxford when I did
that insane Alan Aragon debate.

2299
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:40,050
I stopped off at Oxford on the way to
Manchester and we had a long conversation

2300
02:22:40,051 --> 02:22:42,270
with Keith. I said, look,
what I want you to do is just

2301
02:22:43,770 --> 02:22:48,630
come up with a hypothesis of obesity
from the fat cells perspective,

2302
02:22:48,930 --> 02:22:49,470
right?

2303
02:22:49,470 --> 02:22:54,470
Shed your brain centric energy balance
centric thing and ask yourself what does

2304
02:22:54,781 --> 02:22:59,040
the fat cell c and if nothing else asked
a student to do it as an experiment.

2305
02:22:59,041 --> 02:23:01,140
I mean that would be a great
thought experiment for kid.

2306
02:23:01,350 --> 02:23:04,860
What's going to make a fat cell fat
and that our assumption is going to be

2307
02:23:04,861 --> 02:23:07,780
that's what's going to make a
human fat. Okay. And Keith said,

2308
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:12,540
he literally said to me, he was retiring
and he was going off to garden. Um,

2309
02:23:12,860 --> 02:23:15,090
I kind of envied him, but
he said, no, I just can't,

2310
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:17,700
I can't put energy balance aside.

2311
02:23:18,030 --> 02:23:21,300
You're telling me to not think in terms
of it's been taken expenditure and I

2312
02:23:21,301 --> 02:23:24,720
can't do it. And I mean
wonderful man. He literally,

2313
02:23:24,721 --> 02:23:27,690
and this is again what I've been
arguing is all these people are soap,

2314
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:32,520
including Stephen who was, you know,
who learned in this world. They're,

2315
02:23:32,530 --> 02:23:37,530
they're so locked into this thinking
that obesity is this energy imbalance and

2316
02:23:38,941 --> 02:23:42,330
they can't get away from it. So everything
they do, everything they interpret.

2317
02:23:42,390 --> 02:23:45,720
And when Stephen says there's study
after study and there's 20 randomized

2318
02:23:45,721 --> 02:23:49,710
control studies and it's
sort of, I'm going to shovel
the evidence on top of you.

2319
02:23:49,711 --> 02:23:52,920
And I'm saying, look, I guarantee
if we go through those 20 studies,

2320
02:23:52,921 --> 02:23:54,570
I'll be just like the Jim Hill study.

2321
02:23:54,900 --> 02:23:59,900
They assumed energy balance was the
cause and then they wanted to see what

2322
02:24:00,061 --> 02:24:03,540
caused energy imbalance. And they
started with the wrong hypothesis.

2323
02:24:03,541 --> 02:24:07,920
They're trapped in a paradigm. We've all
seen this. Can I respond to this? Okay.

2324
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:08,933
So,

2325
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:13,710
uh, Gary, I preordered your book. I
have a copy of your book right here.

2326
02:24:13,711 --> 02:24:15,120
Good calories,
bad calories.

2327
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:20,370
I preordered this in 2008 because I
was so excited to read this book. Yes.

2328
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:21,660
And will email me.

2329
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:26,720
I tore through it and I was so persuaded
when I initially read this 10 years ago

2330
02:24:27,390 --> 02:24:31,200
that I ate a low carbohydrate diet
for six months cause I thought I was,

2331
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:34,080
I thought the carbs, we're going to
make me fat and give me diabetes.

2332
02:24:34,590 --> 02:24:39,590
So I was fully immersed and convinced by
your perspective when I read this book.

2333
02:24:41,401 --> 02:24:45,600
Yeah. And you and you sign this
book, you see I have your signature.

2334
02:24:45,990 --> 02:24:50,990
We had a very nice dinner together and
the thing that caused me to go away from

2335
02:24:52,471 --> 02:24:56,880
that perspective was when I actually
started investigating the evidence on my

2336
02:24:56,881 --> 02:25:01,560
own underlying these ideas.
I started doing my own research.

2337
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:03,060
I didn't take your word for it.

2338
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:07,140
I started doing my own research in the
lab as well and actually doing real

2339
02:25:07,141 --> 02:25:08,280
scientific studies.

2340
02:25:08,370 --> 02:25:13,050
But what you are standing and found that
it did not line up with what you were

2341
02:25:13,051 --> 02:25:16,170
saying in your book. And what I ended
up realizing about good calories,

2342
02:25:16,171 --> 02:25:17,040
bad calories

2343
02:25:18,750 --> 02:25:23,750
is essentially your arguments primarily
rely on historical narratives and

2344
02:25:24,101 --> 02:25:24,970
speculation.

2345
02:25:24,971 --> 02:25:29,740
And there's very little of actually saying
what is the most pertinent scientific

2346
02:25:29,741 --> 02:25:33,430
evidence to answer this question.
And what does that evidence have to say?

2347
02:25:33,431 --> 02:25:37,690
It's mostly historical narratives.
And honestly, you know, I'm,

2348
02:25:37,740 --> 02:25:41,080
I'm going to try to say this
in in a non insulting way,

2349
02:25:41,081 --> 02:25:44,440
but I will simply say that others who
have looked at the same historical

2350
02:25:44,441 --> 02:25:48,500
evidence have come to different
conclusions then you have. Um,

2351
02:25:48,510 --> 02:25:52,180
and that includes me in the places where
I've looked at the historical evidence.

2352
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:55,240
And so, um, I think that, you know,

2353
02:25:55,241 --> 02:25:59,590
this idea that I am like locked in
some paradigm and can't see what you're

2354
02:25:59,591 --> 02:26:02,350
talking about. I was there
Gary. I am posting. Yeah,

2355
02:26:02,910 --> 02:26:05,750
let me then, okay, so let
me, let me, let me just,

2356
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:08,080
it was interesting cause you're
going to wrap this up soon.

2357
02:26:08,081 --> 02:26:12,020
So we've really gone there
three hours almost. Um,

2358
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:16,240
remember when you drove up here from San
Diego this morning and I was listening

2359
02:26:16,241 --> 02:26:21,241
to Stephan on a different podcast and
you were talking about how your eating

2360
02:26:21,281 --> 02:26:26,281
behavior differed on low carb diets
versus the higher carb diet you eat now.

2361
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:29,200
And you talked about your resistance,

2362
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:33,580
it was easier to fast on the
low carb diet. Correct. Okay.

2363
02:26:33,581 --> 02:26:36,010
And you didn't really have
an explanation for it.

2364
02:26:36,850 --> 02:26:40,210
I don't have a very well anyway,
go ahead. Yeah, so again,

2365
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:45,250
the argument I've been making is this,
there's two ways to look at everything.

2366
02:26:45,850 --> 02:26:49,060
So one way is the low carb
diet, somehow the, because of,

2367
02:26:49,061 --> 02:26:51,350
I don't food reward his shoes

2368
02:26:54,190 --> 02:26:58,240
affects your urge to eat
car and low carb foods.

2369
02:26:58,750 --> 02:27:01,260
And because of that you don't

2370
02:27:03,810 --> 02:27:07,980
hunger for them as much. And uh,
when you're on a higher carb diet,

2371
02:27:07,981 --> 02:27:11,310
I think the way you phrased on and start
the podcast was your body sort of tells

2372
02:27:11,311 --> 02:27:14,070
you what to meal time.
So it's conditioned to me better.

2373
02:27:14,370 --> 02:27:16,080
So the alternative hypothesis here,

2374
02:27:16,081 --> 02:27:19,140
the other way to think about it is on the
low carb diet isn't insulin levels are

2375
02:27:19,141 --> 02:27:21,210
staying lower.
And when they're saying lower,

2376
02:27:21,211 --> 02:27:24,660
he's mobilizing fat and
he's oxidizing that fat.

2377
02:27:24,661 --> 02:27:27,410
And as you said on the podcast,
and have you been, uh, you know,

2378
02:27:27,411 --> 02:27:32,411
the 135 pound marathon or has enough
fat in this body to run for a week.

2379
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,670
So the reason you're able to skip
meals is because insulin is low fuel.

2380
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:42,210
My wife is calling, she's probably
telling me I'm getting shrill. Um,

2381
02:27:43,050 --> 02:27:44,730
there's a different way
to look at everything.

2382
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:47,310
That's the point I'm trying
to put every study. I mean,

2383
02:27:47,610 --> 02:27:49,440
tell me evidence that,

2384
02:27:49,980 --> 02:27:54,980
can you give me actual evidence that the
lower level of insulin is the cause of

2385
02:27:55,021 --> 02:27:55,920
not needing to use

2386
02:27:56,120 --> 02:28:00,910
his meals? No. Okay. I'm giving you a high
palm. Glad you're being all gamuts. No,

2387
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:04,040
that's what you're saying. Like we
were talking about fasting, right?

2388
02:28:04,070 --> 02:28:06,440
If you're fasting for a certain
prolonged period of time,

2389
02:28:06,441 --> 02:28:09,320
your body's going to go into a ketogenic
state. We all agree with that. Right?

2390
02:28:09,321 --> 02:28:11,810
And that's,
that's the reason why it's easier to fast.

2391
02:28:11,811 --> 02:28:13,610
Once you're in key to genic states,

2392
02:28:13,611 --> 02:28:18,470
your body starts burning off fat and this
is a widely reported that's living on

2393
02:28:18,471 --> 02:28:20,900
fat. It's metabolically flexible.
You don't have date cause,

2394
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:25,730
but it's the idea that it's living on
your fat is evidence that you're getting

2395
02:28:25,731 --> 02:28:29,600
thinner on that low carb diet is,
it's that balance.

2396
02:28:29,601 --> 02:28:32,150
It's the amount of your eating
minus the amount your burn now,

2397
02:28:32,151 --> 02:28:35,240
but it's a question as it's tossed with
the amount you're trapping and that's

2398
02:28:35,241 --> 02:28:37,190
what you keep leaving out.
So if you have no,

2399
02:28:37,191 --> 02:28:40,400
that has been tested is what I'm saying.

2400
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:44,440
It has not been tested. That's what
I'm saying. That's why we founded Nusi.

2401
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:46,220
That's why we spent $30 million.

2402
02:28:46,221 --> 02:28:49,330
That's why David Ludwig is doing
another $13 million starting.

2403
02:28:49,610 --> 02:28:53,000
It has not been tested. When
you, when you feed people,

2404
02:28:53,001 --> 02:28:57,590
whether it's overfeeding or underfeeding
and you're causing weight loss or

2405
02:28:57,591 --> 02:29:02,300
weight maintenance, the carb to fat ratio
of the Diet makes almost no different.

2406
02:29:02,301 --> 02:29:06,800
Me Give you another many studies on this
famous feeding study from the 60s which

2407
02:29:06,801 --> 02:29:10,120
I thought when you said Horton, I
thought you meant Ed Hort, not Tj Horton.

2408
02:29:10,130 --> 02:29:14,150
So at Horton and Ethan Sims at a
prisoner study, they literally,

2409
02:29:14,151 --> 02:29:16,580
they wanted to get the overfeed.
Again,

2410
02:29:16,581 --> 02:29:18,590
they're using their thinking
in terms of eating too much.

2411
02:29:18,591 --> 02:29:23,591
They wanted to get first get college
kids to gain 25% of excess body weight.

2412
02:29:24,350 --> 02:29:27,560
This was in the 60s and they couldn't
get the college kids to do it,

2413
02:29:27,561 --> 02:29:31,070
which suggests that college kids were
different in the 60s and they are today.

2414
02:29:31,370 --> 02:29:35,630
So they used prisoners in the Vermont
state prison and they overfed them.

2415
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:38,370
And you discuss this in your book.
Um,

2416
02:29:39,650 --> 02:29:44,650
they could get these prisoners to
eat 10,000 calories a day of excess

2417
02:29:45,651 --> 02:29:50,170
carbohydrates,
excess calories.

2418
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:53,380
It was calories, not carbohydrate,
might've been calories.

2419
02:29:53,530 --> 02:29:58,180
They couldn't get them to add more
than a thousand calories of fat. Okay.

2420
02:29:58,181 --> 02:29:59,060
And they talk about this,

2421
02:29:59,090 --> 02:30:02,680
Sim studies were crazy cause they
published in 15 different journals.

2422
02:30:02,681 --> 02:30:05,530
So they interpret the study.
If you looked at pounds gained,

2423
02:30:06,490 --> 02:30:06,860
okay

2424
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:08,240
per calorie added,

2425
02:30:08,270 --> 02:30:13,270
they gained more per calorie of fat
than they did per calorie of carbs.

2426
02:30:14,330 --> 02:30:16,820
But if you looked at
how much they could eat,

2427
02:30:18,050 --> 02:30:23,050
they couldn't add that much fat and they
could add eight thousand seven thousand

2428
02:30:23,061 --> 02:30:24,290
extras calories of carbs in.

2429
02:30:24,291 --> 02:30:27,740
It's actually a line in one of the papers
when they said they would eat 10,000

2430
02:30:27,741 --> 02:30:31,430
calories and then go to bed hungry,
craving more carbs.

2431
02:30:31,431 --> 02:30:32,930
So then the question becomes,
again,

2432
02:30:32,931 --> 02:30:36,650
is it because the carbs are
doing something in the brain
to increase food reward

2433
02:30:36,890 --> 02:30:39,860
or is it the carbs are doing something
in the body so that their body has

2434
02:30:39,861 --> 02:30:44,861
figured out a way it can orchestrate
deal with this massive influx of carbs

2435
02:30:45,411 --> 02:30:49,010
versus fat.
But there's always two ways to look at it.

2436
02:30:49,011 --> 02:30:52,070
And every time Stephen says
there's masses of evidence,

2437
02:30:52,071 --> 02:30:55,130
my job as a journalist
was to go through and say,

2438
02:30:55,131 --> 02:30:59,060
does this refute that hypothesis? And
if it doesn't, we have to hold onto it.

2439
02:30:59,061 --> 02:31:03,770
Because remember we have an obesity and
diabetes epidemic and the kind of advice

2440
02:31:03,771 --> 02:31:05,750
where we tell people to sleep better

2441
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:11,010
and eat less or avoid
foods that they love,

2442
02:31:11,011 --> 02:31:15,660
don't have pizza and ice cream.
It's implies that the reason they get fat,

2443
02:31:16,050 --> 02:31:17,460
even the overeating and hypothesis,

2444
02:31:17,461 --> 02:31:21,420
you think they should be eating pizza
and cream? What do you think? Uh, no,

2445
02:31:21,421 --> 02:31:24,990
I think we would both say don't eat pizza
and I don't ask questions like that.

2446
02:31:24,991 --> 02:31:27,450
Thank you. Um, the, uh,

2447
02:31:29,210 --> 02:31:34,080
is something wrong out there? Tragically
wrong. We know. If nothing else,

2448
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:36,690
I think you would agree with us. So
the whole low carb movement, it's,

2449
02:31:36,691 --> 02:31:40,860
you set it on this podcast was that, you
know what I've done, if nothing else,

2450
02:31:40,861 --> 02:31:42,390
as I've convinced people,

2451
02:31:42,391 --> 02:31:46,110
they could eat low carb diets
without killing themselves.
So that's a good thing.

2452
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:50,460
And I'm implying that I assume what
the sugar book, even if I'm wrong,

2453
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:53,250
that getting people to eat
less sugar is a good thing.

2454
02:31:53,780 --> 02:31:57,830
So ultimately these are good things
that I've done. My overall really, Gary,

2455
02:31:58,890 --> 02:32:03,870
not entirely because you're telling
people that only carbohydrate matters.

2456
02:32:03,930 --> 02:32:07,470
I'm not telling Halleran table hardware.
You have argued at length.

2457
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:12,500
I in calorie intake and dietary fat
intake and physical activity do not

2458
02:32:12,961 --> 02:32:17,100
influenced body fatness and are not
important for your with your ex the wrong

2459
02:32:17,101 --> 02:32:18,450
way. I'm arguing that. No,

2460
02:32:18,451 --> 02:32:22,020
if you're going to look at the model
that we published that you contributed to

2461
02:32:22,021 --> 02:32:22,950
and we signed off on,

2462
02:32:22,951 --> 02:32:26,730
it doesn't say anything about
physics says that physical activity,

2463
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:30,630
dietary fat intake and calorie
and take are not important.

2464
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:32,200
Refuse that.

2465
02:32:32,480 --> 02:32:37,090
Somebody who's on Scott that way
because they were sedentary. Okay, okay.

2466
02:32:38,310 --> 02:32:39,000
Requires,

2467
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:44,000
but what I'm saying is that there is
harm in what you're saying because yes,

2468
02:32:44,131 --> 02:32:47,160
we all agree that these
carbohydrates are fattening.

2469
02:32:47,370 --> 02:32:51,630
But you're saying that these other
important things are irrelevant and that's

2470
02:32:51,631 --> 02:32:53,920
the dangerous part of what you're saying.
No,

2471
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,050
what I'm saying about calories is it's
the wrong way to think about it. So wait,

2472
02:32:58,051 --> 02:33:00,690
you think they do matter?
I chained calories or the wrong.

2473
02:33:00,691 --> 02:33:02,550
Don't put words in went.
Okay. Do they matter?

2474
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:06,930
Do calories matter our way to measure
the quantity of food you're eating?

2475
02:33:06,931 --> 02:33:10,680
It could use grams. You could use anything
else that you want. The question is,

2476
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:14,220
is it the right way to think about it?
Can you solve an obesity?

2477
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:16,890
Let me give you an example before we go.
Let me just read.

2478
02:33:16,970 --> 02:33:21,970
So excess calorie intake and physical
inactivity or secondary to this process

2479
02:33:23,070 --> 02:33:27,720
and not themselves determinants of
body fat. That is what you said.

2480
02:33:27,721 --> 02:33:31,860
Fine in our, uh, can I read you
some debate notes? Okay. That's,

2481
02:33:31,861 --> 02:33:34,460
I'm not putting words in your mouth.
You just want to read that yet,

2482
02:33:34,461 --> 02:33:39,330
but that's different than what
you just tried. Okay, sure
it is. They're just, okay.

2483
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:40,270
Let me read you something.

2484
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:44,160
They just never seem to be enough
food to sift shade Carl's growing body

2485
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:45,100
afterschool.

2486
02:33:45,100 --> 02:33:48,150
You would need a footlong sub before
his mother's home cooked dinners.

2487
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:50,820
Even after having a hefty
lunch of homemade chicken,

2488
02:33:50,821 --> 02:33:54,870
rice and vegetables and his favorite
snacks, granola bars and bunch or crunch.

2489
02:33:55,650 --> 02:34:00,390
Okay. A lot of calories and
a lot of them are one person.

2490
02:34:00,750 --> 02:34:04,380
We are talking about what we, yeah. How
is this going to, I just want to know,

2491
02:34:04,410 --> 02:34:08,730
just one of my colleagues
has one anecdotal,

2492
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:13,620
one of my problems with the hoe over
eating hypothesis is it's taught to

2493
02:34:13,621 --> 02:34:18,010
logical. You don't know if someone's
overeating unless they're fat.

2494
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:22,270
Right? Uh, incorrect. Well, this fellow,

2495
02:34:22,271 --> 02:34:26,390
I just read your calorie
intake and you can know, well,

2496
02:34:26,450 --> 02:34:28,420
wait a second about there Gary.

2497
02:34:28,421 --> 02:34:30,910
We would eat a footlong sub before
it's mother's home cooked dinners.

2498
02:34:30,920 --> 02:34:33,640
Even after having a half the lunch of
homemade chicken, rice and vegetables.

2499
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:38,800
Again, that's one story, but the
point is, my point is it's like

2500
02:34:41,380 --> 02:34:45,050
you cannot tell if someone's fat.
I,

2501
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,320
you have no idea how many
calories I consume. Right.

2502
02:34:48,190 --> 02:34:53,190
I could probably get a pretty decent
estimate actually based on a published

2503
02:34:53,201 --> 02:34:56,850
formulas. Okay. So, and then how would
you know whether I was overeating?

2504
02:34:56,860 --> 02:35:00,480
Remember we're talking about 10
calories get stored in the fat tissue.

2505
02:35:00,490 --> 02:35:04,870
Well that depends on whether you
meet, how you define that. But um, I,

2506
02:35:05,020 --> 02:35:10,020
I could look at your body composition
and I could tell you whether you are over

2507
02:35:10,581 --> 02:35:15,130
eating relative to a lean person. Yes.
Because I have excess body fat. Correct.

2508
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:17,920
Yeah. So without knowing
if I have excess body fat,

2509
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:20,440
you cannot tell whether I'm overeating,

2510
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:22,780
which is the cause of the excess body fat.
Right?

2511
02:35:23,710 --> 02:35:27,220
Doesn't that strike you as circular?
There's nothing circular about it. Look,

2512
02:35:27,400 --> 02:35:32,200
if you take somebody and you increase
their calorie intake, carbs or fat,

2513
02:35:32,201 --> 02:35:35,280
either way, the gain, body fat,
there's nothing circular on it.

2514
02:35:35,281 --> 02:35:39,070
I'm not saying that calories in choice
body pretty confident that the fellow,

2515
02:35:39,071 --> 02:35:44,071
and if you take someone who is currently
has obesity and you reduced their

2516
02:35:44,171 --> 02:35:48,640
calorie intake, carbs or fat doesn't
make any difference, they lose body fat.

2517
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:53,080
There's nothing circular
about this calorie thing at
all. It does make it, no, no,

2518
02:35:53,081 --> 02:35:57,970
I just, I don't understand how you
could possibly think that was circular.

2519
02:35:57,971 --> 02:36:00,640
It's so simple and direct.
Let me go through it one more time.

2520
02:36:00,820 --> 02:36:02,850
No, listen, you're not going
through anything. One more time.

2521
02:36:03,530 --> 02:36:06,000
We're going to wrap this up cause I don't
think we're getting anything done here.

2522
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:10,930
Uh, it was a lot of fun.
It was that much fun.

2523
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:14,000
It was, it was interesting.
I mean there's, I,

2524
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:17,310
I don't know who to believe
quite honestly. I think, uh,

2525
02:36:17,390 --> 02:36:20,030
you both make some excellent points and a,

2526
02:36:20,031 --> 02:36:25,031
I think there's definitely some real
legitimate concern that you have about his

2527
02:36:25,581 --> 02:36:29,450
position. And I think that your
position, it has some merit as well,

2528
02:36:29,451 --> 02:36:33,480
the position about insulin and
about carbohydrates and sugar. Um,

2529
02:36:33,860 --> 02:36:37,310
this is a really long conversation and
I think we could probably do this for

2530
02:36:37,311 --> 02:36:41,420
another six days. Forget
about hours. Uh, I think, uh,

2531
02:36:41,450 --> 02:36:43,460
if I would recommend people,

2532
02:36:43,461 --> 02:36:46,610
I think people have to really kind
of figure this out for themselves.

2533
02:36:46,611 --> 02:36:50,810
I would recommend, uh, Stefan,
please recommend your book.
What is your book again?

2534
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:54,620
The book is called the hungry, very hungry
