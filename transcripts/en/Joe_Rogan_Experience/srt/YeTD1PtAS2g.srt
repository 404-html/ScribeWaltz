1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,530
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,200
What is that all law about obscenity?

3
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:05,460
How do you define upset at me?

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:05,971
That was the,

5
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,590
that's the question in a lot of trials,

6
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:07,890
right?

7
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,700
Well community standards
and this is why it's,

8
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:11,160
it's in trouble and by the way,

9
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,980
I would love to know where all like
the fucking libertarian political

10
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,920
organizations where when Max
hardcore went to jail for four years,

11
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,030
cause they nailed him when he,

12
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:19,890
when he mailed stuff to fucking Tampa,

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,150
Florida stinkers type of stuff and they
trapped him and got him on some obscene

14
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,260
community standards thing.

15
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,240
But we always are.

16
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,450
But he's sticking up for Max hardcore.

17
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:29,940
This guy did for years
for adult pornography.

18
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,140
It's fucking adults.

19
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:32,490
There was no children involved.

20
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:37,491
It seems really strange that you could
have something that is not illegal.

21
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,670
That is obviously it's marketable.

22
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,220
I mean whether or not it's healthy
to watch that kind of shit.

23
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,450
It's obviously people are watching it
and there was always an argument that

24
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:52,020
certain types of depravity keeps people
from committing things in the real life

25
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:55,320
that they can get through it in some
sort of a fantasy form and it keeps him

26
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,320
from being a creep or a violent
person in their real life.

27
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,560
And if someone signs of
fucking waiver man and what,

28
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,730
where do you cross the line?

29
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,790
Where do you decide that this is something
that this guy needs to get locked in

30
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,624
a cage for?

31
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,703
Cause you don't agree?

32
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,650
Well the whole country is full of shit
when it comes to free speech and free

33
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:11,910
thought cause all of us,

34
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,010
and I mean I should say all ideologies,

35
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:15,900
liberal and conservative have an asterisk.

36
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,140
Like you're free to say
this and do this as long as,

37
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,490
and for the liberals,

38
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:23,700
it's what they call hate speech and
anything that's racial or homophobia.

39
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,200
And for the Conservatives it's,

40
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:25,351
hey,

41
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,760
don't fuck with God and country.

42
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,660
But both sides are equally phony when
it comes to like when's the last time,

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,650
uh,

44
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:31,981
like you know,

45
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:36,981
a feminist stuck up for a guy who said
something about women that was unpleasant

46
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,910
because he has the right to say it.

47
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,380
Never like we were all these people
when Tracy Morgan said what he said,

48
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,750
why did nobody who didn't
like him stick up for him?

49
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,733
Oh Gosh,

50
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,040
I think this is like the don't
have that much resources.

51
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,820
So it's not like they can jump into
the fray on for any little situation.

52
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,870
They don't have that much time.

53
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:58,530
When you're running some sort of an
organization that's looking for violence

54
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,870
against women or anything
but mean you don't have,

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,060
you have to look at
concentrate only on that.

56
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:08,061
I don't fault them for going after or
not going after cases where guys like

57
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,100
Tracy Morgan got [inaudible].

58
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,810
Now they only have a certain amount
of things they want to concentrate on.

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,021
But no,

60
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:16,060
I mean I fault him for
going after him because I,

61
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:16,600
you know,

62
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,570
he's white like white.

63
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,900
Like when people went after him,

64
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,490
why didn't they just
stick up for him and go,

65
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,720
we don't like what he said,

66
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,600
but he's got the right to say it and
there should be no penalty for it.

67
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,410
That's what I mean.

68
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,280
And none of these groups,

69
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,800
which would take them two seconds
to put out that fucking memo,

70
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,150
but glad has never done it.

71
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,133
None of them have done it.

72
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,471
No,

73
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:31,590
they,

74
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:31,790
no,

75
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,490
they don't devote any resources to
helping anybody else out there develop

76
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:39,870
resources to pushing their ideology and
their ideology is that this guy needs to

77
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:40,650
be punished,

78
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:40,831
right?

79
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,930
Because if he's punished and
it cost him a lot of money,

80
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,580
then people are going to
stop thinking like that.

81
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,470
You're going to stop expressing
themselves like that,

82
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,820
which I can see their point it up to a
certain point where you got to realize

83
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,401
like if is,

84
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,380
is it okay,

85
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,550
where does this,

86
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,120
where does this,

87
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,410
uh,

88
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,420
where's this line happen?

89
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:59,860
Is it okay for Denzel Washington to play
a murderer and a gangster and a movie?

90
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,461
It is.

91
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,150
Right.

92
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,870
Okay.

93
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
Why is it not okay for Tracy Morgan to
portray a guy who's pretending that he

94
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,840
would stab is Sonifi was gay
because he's not telling the truth.

95
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,430
He's,

96
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,760
he's gay.

97
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,150
He's obviously doing a character that
is like completely over the top and says

98
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:17,380
ridiculous shit all the time.

99
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,250
That is,

100
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,420
that's his shtick.

101
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:19,691
I'll,

102
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,080
by the way,

103
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,640
I was incorrect when I apologize.

104
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,331
You just straighten me out.

105
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:23,280
When I said the women's groups,

106
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,280
I should have said the gay groups.

107
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:24,941
I was thinking that it was,

108
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,340
Tracy said something that was anti woman.

109
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,270
I forgot that it was that.

110
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,040
I actually forgot what I
just went with the conflict.

111
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,420
I'm saying why doesn't the group who's a,

112
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,800
you're saying that gay dudes are women.

113
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,881
Um,

114
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,810
so all the great ones are,

115
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,021
I mean,

116
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,854
let's be honest,

117
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,260
who hasn't seen a transsexual
and fallen in love?

118
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,240
It's an open society folks.

119
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:40,961
Yeah,

120
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:43,450
I think Tracy got you.

121
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,660
People have to understand that there's
people that want to see him do that.

122
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,310
You might not like it,

123
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,210
but it's like dice.

124
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,170
I'd love dice.

125
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,340
I've always loved dice.

126
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,470
I want to see him go fucking bananas.

127
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,920
It's a form of entertainment.

128
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:56,200
And if he does it about Italians,

129
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,034
which I am,

130
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,521
I will,

131
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,300
I will laugh.

132
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,320
I will laugh along with it.

133
00:03:59,321 --> 00:03:59,891
Cause I know,

134
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,251
you know,

135
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,210
if he's making fun of us,

136
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:01,380
it's,

137
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,950
it's mostly true shit,

138
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,671
you know.

139
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,380
But for whatever reason,

140
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,210
some people want to pretend that you know,

141
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,630
some of his ridiculous over the
top stereotypes aren't funny.

142
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,940
It's like that's a crew
delirious character.

143
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,570
This character of fucking
hates that break man.

144
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,691
I love it.

145
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,040
It's great entertainment.

146
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,221
I,

147
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:18,600
you know,

148
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,890
swallow my load yet chew.

149
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,990
It takes that seriously.

150
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,370
Why would you be angry?

151
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:24,791
This guy,

152
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,120
why?

153
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,631
I mean it's,

154
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,470
this is just,

155
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,790
this is entertainment.

156
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,140
It's comedy and it's a,

157
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,110
it's a valid form of comedy and
this is where it gets weird.

158
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:33,360
It's like when you,

159
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,360
when a guy's creating art and to break,

160
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:35,981
believe it or not,

161
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:39,130
Tracy Morgan's creating fucking art when
he gets on stage and he does standup

162
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,263
you,

163
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,530
he's not trying to
fucking piss people off.

164
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,820
He's just going with,

165
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,170
this is one of the,

166
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,910
this is one of the styles of comedy.

167
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,400
You say completely outrageous shit.

168
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,850
We all know guys who would sit like
Brian Holtzman is one of my perfect

169
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:55,331
examples.

170
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:55,530
You need,

171
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,351
do you know Brian?

172
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:56,560
Sure.

173
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,221
I'm saying the Harry's.

174
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:57,490
Yeah.

175
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,010
He did a joke about Susan Smith after,

176
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,620
after Susan Smith got caught drowning.

177
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,440
He goes on stage like two
days later and he goes,

178
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,380
the Susan Smith case
and she'd drawn a kid.

179
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:09,040
Yeah,

180
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,210
I heard those were bad kids.

181
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,760
I heard they sat that close to the TV.

182
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,170
They always spelt a fucking milk.

183
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,430
They don't put away their blocks.

184
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,730
Those kids will not be missed and we were
laughing and gang the whole audience.

185
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:26,890
It was a combination of laughs and
gasps and that's a valid piece of art.

186
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,300
That's a valid piece of art.

187
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,310
He doesn't really mean that he doesn't,

188
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,990
if he had to choose,

189
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,531
he would say,

190
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:32,861
yes,

191
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:35,650
please go back in time and stop
her before she tells her children.

192
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,940
He's a character.

193
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:40,330
He's playing a crazy
accentuated character.

194
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,310
He gets into a zone and he does this,

195
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,600
this thing on stage and he says like
really offensive shit and it's fucking

196
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,220
funny and I enjoy it.

197
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,480
It's art or even when you're just being
yourself and exploring a ridiculous

198
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,440
concept.

199
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,370
But we never,

200
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,050
people never stick up for that.

201
00:05:56,051 --> 00:06:00,260
And the same people that would defend
maple Thorpe or any other form of art,

202
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,480
piss Christ in a jar are the same.

203
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,110
There's the same mentality that will
attack Tracy or that will attack,

204
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,093
ah,

205
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,240
I missed what he said,

206
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:08,990
or Michael Richards.

207
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,260
It's a fraudulent stance
and every side does it.

208
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:13,670
It drives me fucking crazy.

209
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,241
I think there's,

210
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:14,660
yeah,

211
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,730
it's cause cause people have this idea,

212
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,870
a lot of people I should say have this
idea that if you don't agree with them,

213
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,510
you're wrong and your,

214
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:23,841
your,

215
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,171
your,

216
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:24,490
uh,

217
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:24,951
if you're,

218
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:25,130
uh,

219
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,210
you're against them.

220
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:26,690
You don't,

221
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,320
it's not like you can enjoy different
things or have different ideas about

222
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,640
different standards of living
and what you shouldn't,

223
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,380
shouldn't be able to do.

224
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,561
No,

225
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,100
it's not that.

226
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,261
It's,

227
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,390
if you don't agree,

228
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,440
you're wrong.

229
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,830
And people have to understand that
different people like different shit.

230
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,060
Right.

231
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,790
And you can't force
someone to not like porn.

232
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,060
You can't force someone
to say you're not gay.

233
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,391
You know,

234
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:47,551
you,

235
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,530
you cannot be gay.

236
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:48,890
We're not all,

237
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,611
you can't do that.

238
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,540
It doesn't work.

239
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,420
Like you have to let people do whatever
the fuck they want to do and then you

240
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:55,250
just got to kind of
accept that that's them.

241
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,290
And I wish a lot of
these phony artists like,

242
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:57,951
and I say phony,

243
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,080
like,

244
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,970
I mean many singers,

245
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,980
I think that they're hit
by attacking Christianity.

246
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,650
Like I have no prob attack Christianity
fucking shorts right there.

247
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,260
But it's like none of them address Islam.

248
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
None of them are addressed.

249
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:09,740
The fact that they're afraid to attack is,

250
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,550
and that's what drives me crazy
because it's this fucking fake edge.

251
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,091
It's the,

252
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:15,350
it's this fucking fake.

253
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,430
I'm being dangerous.

254
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,181
But it's really,

255
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:19,970
they're looking both ways before they
cross the street and they're acting like

256
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,610
they just bolted out the front
door and it fucking drives me.

257
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:23,690
It drives me nuts.

258
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,621
Yeah.

259
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:25,520
It's the,

260
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:25,780
the,

261
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,640
there's a certain amount
of posturing that people,

262
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,000
uh,

263
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,050
people get into when they start talking
about certain political issues and

264
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,000
certain things and certain ideologies.

265
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,200
And it gets to like that gross place
where people just start clapping and you

266
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,610
can tell they're disingenuous.

267
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:41,210
And it just,

268
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,880
there are milking off this
thing for their own ego.

269
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,240
They're milking off this reality for
their own ego instead of just sort of

270
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,170
trying to,

271
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,003
you know,

272
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,740
trying to look at the
big picture because the,

273
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,583
the big,

274
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,060
you mean what?

275
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,170
You're absolutely right.

276
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:56,150
Why doesn't anybody want
to make fun of Islam?

277
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,750
I'll tell you why.

278
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,980
Because they'll fucking kill you.

279
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,280
Yeah.

280
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,840
Like they took shit to an
entirely different place
and so anybody who wants to

281
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:03,950
pretend to be edgy,

282
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,720
it doesn't involve going that far.

283
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,230
I mock them but I mean I can,

284
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,200
I'm careful where I put
the Joe come out an idiot.

285
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,940
You know crazy though.

286
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,820
You right now just admitted to
self censorship for the same thing.

287
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,900
You just find it more reasonable because
you say that your take on it as well

288
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:18,020
are,

289
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,291
you know,

290
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,280
I'll take it back a little bit,

291
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:19,431
you know,

292
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,180
as far as I know,

293
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,540
but you are clearly saying
that you wouldn't say what
you'd normally would want

294
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,590
to say because they're dangerous.

295
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,330
Sure.

296
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:25,640
But,

297
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
but I will say that that's
why I'm not saying it.

298
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,093
Isn't that amazing.

299
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,230
It's a terrifying thing in 2012 that we
still have a faction of our world that

300
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:36,320
you have to literally
can't draw their guy.

301
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,740
But I also won't say other
things on stage for feeling like,

302
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,161
you know what I mean?

303
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:40,401
It's like,

304
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:40,701
you know,

305
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,430
a nigger is a rough word to pull out.

306
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:45,110
You better have a reason
before you say that on stage.

307
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:45,801
You can't just go out.

308
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,580
And I would never say
it an anger at somebody,

309
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,610
but it's like every,

310
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:52,700
everything has lines and stuff
and reasons I don't say it.

311
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,560
And I do self sensor and I
think we all do as comics.

312
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,281
You Ha you have to.

313
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,114
We're not crazy,

314
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,460
but I never want people
panelize when they don't.

315
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,320
That's the difference.

316
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,440
Yeah.

317
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,273
Well it's horrible.

318
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,031
You ready to,

319
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,690
of course record.

320
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,081
Oh,

321
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:32,914
it is already.

322
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,000
What the fuck's on?
