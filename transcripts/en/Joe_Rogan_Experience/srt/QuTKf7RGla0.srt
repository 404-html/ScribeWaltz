1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,923
Boom.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,630
[inaudible].

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,461
This is how we do this.

4
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:08,670
We have two commercials that we do
before we do the actual podcast,

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,370
but a,

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,660
they're very informal and you can jump
in at anytime if you feel like if you

7
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:13,351
have questions,

8
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,190
if you have a comment,

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,323
feel free.

10
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,030
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,260
If you go to Joe Rogan done,

12
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:19,540

flashlight and her in the code name,

14
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:22,920

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,300
you will save yourself 15% off
the number one sex toy for men.

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,830
Holla at that.

17
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,550
My boy Justin buckles,

18
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,820
always talking about the flashlight.

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,551
Does he have one?

20
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,180
He loves it.

21
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,890
It's fucking palace from Alaska.

22
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,431
Oh,

23
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,300
you need one up there.

24
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,010
It's either that or a seal.

25
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,620
You might get it stolen to borrowed.

26
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,860
That's disgusting.

27
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,770
Borrowed another man's fleshlight rude.

28
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,360
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com makers of Alpha brain shrink to

29
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,110
Algebra and you need
some Alpha brain alpha.

30
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:54,750
Do you try it?

31
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,530
You'll like it.

32
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,363
I have no idea.

33
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,620
I'm just saying my brain's Oh,

34
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,351
in your brain you're in.

35
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,310
Alpha brain was,

36
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,410
it's a combination of nutrients that
are designed to enhance your cognitive

37
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:04,821
function.

38
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:08,730
It's all like they increase your brain's
ability to produce neurotransmitters

39
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,100
there.

40
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,320
It's called nootropics and Nutro Bexar,

41
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,761
a very,

42
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:12,030
uh,

43
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,601
it's very,

44
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:12,781
uh,

45
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,880
interesting and fascinating subject to me.

46
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:18,570
I've been involved in them for years and
I was talking about a bill Romanowski

47
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:19,080
stuff.

48
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,070
It's called neuro one.

49
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,940
That's how I got into it.

50
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,690
Um,

51
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,860
he makes a great product and he started
making it after he developed a bunch of

52
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:29,710
concussions from football and
he came up with this mixture.

53
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,330
It's a mixture of
nutrients that a enhanced,

54
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,740
the way his brain worked was having,

55
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:34,980
uh,

56
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,000
having some issues with that.

57
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,130
So that's a fascinating subject.

58
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,260
If you're interested in nootropics at all,

59
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:41,100
just Google it.

60
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,270
Please do some research.

61
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,320
Don't just go buy shit.

62
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,270
But if you're interested
in what we're selling,

63
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,740

n,

66
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:51,120
I t and a checkout Alpha
brain and truth tech,

67
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:51,511
sport,

68
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:51,811
shroom,

69
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,644
tech immune,

70
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,580
all the different,

71
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:53,911
there's,

72
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,770
there's different
supplements for athletics.

73
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:57,930
There's different supplements
for thinking for your mood.

74
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,400
None of them are illegal.

75
00:01:59,430 --> 00:01:59,701
Every,

76
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,490
you're not going to fail a piss
test and all of them are safe.

77
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,700
It's all explained on,

78
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:08,580
on at.com and we try to make this as
even and fair as humanly possible.

79
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:09,870
So when you order 30 pills,

80
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:10,710
if you don't like it,

81
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,191
you try it.

82
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:11,970
You don't like it.

83
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,290
You don't have to even return it.

84
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,460
Just say this stuff sucks.

85
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,050
You get your money back 100%.

86
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,870
We're way more concerned with not having
people feel ripped off than we are with

87
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:21,704
making money.

88
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,920
And I would never sell anything if it
wasn't something that I actually use and

89
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:26,820
actually believed in.

90
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,960
I take that shit before every show and
we've got some right in here somewhere.

91
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,580
I'll take it eventually,

92
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,373
but uh,

93
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,000
so we'll get to that again.

94
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,133
Take a look at it.

95
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,640
It's a,

96
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,640
it's vitamins there you
said will test positive.

97
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:44,730
No,

98
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,690
you won't test positive.

99
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,763
It's nothing.

100
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,311
Nothing.

101
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:49,770
You really have to worry about it and
people in the world actually have to get

102
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:50,590
tested.

103
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,950
You've got to be small.

104
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,981
A lot of people,

105
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:53,191
man,

106
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:54,150
you'd be surprised.

107
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,721
Lately,

108
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:58,470
especially I talked to so many
people that get tested on the job,

109
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,050
you know,

110
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,120
they get random drug tests for like,

111
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,560
you know people that work for
companies that don't want assholes.

112
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,810
What's working for them and the watch
be fucked up and showing up at work,

113
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:08,860
cranked out on Meth,

114
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,210
which I totally understand.

115
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,500
But this guy in Columbus,

116
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:11,801
Ohio,

117
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,150
when I was there with Joey Diaz,

118
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,050
he got,

119
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,050
he's been tested 12 times and two years
and so now he's a big pot too so he

120
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,040
smokes that fake shit.

121
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,520
And now like that shit
is so much worse for you.

122
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,401
What's that shit called?

123
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,120
You bite the head shops that
are not what you're talking.

124
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,590
Yeah and that cannot be good for you but
like it and it kind of sucks is Dick.

125
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:34,960
He would smoke it and he and I was like,

126
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:35,794
how long has it lasts?

127
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,390
About three hours and just sit there and
zone out and look at a wall and like it

128
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,490
just sounded awful.

129
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,480
Regular regular jobs where they test,

130
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,020
you suck the fat Dicks,

131
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:45,950
right.

132
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,311
You're right.

133
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:46,900
A favors here.

134
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,860

yourself 10% off any and all orders.

136
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,830
We've got a lot of new stuff coming to
that's on the pipes down the pipes on

137
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,880
sweater or something like that.

138
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,920
Transgression experience.

139
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,960
Try my day.

140
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,130
Joe Rogan podcast,

141
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,860
powerful Uriah Faber has joined us derive
favors on a fucking whirlwind tour of

142
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:13,570
it.

143
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,570
The United States to him publicity for
his book and a four in preparation for

144
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:22,390
his interim title shot that he's got
coming up and a little over a month right

145
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,253
with and Burrell.

146
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,573
Right about a month.

147
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,360
You are a busy mother fucker cause
I keep hearing you on radio shows.

148
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,560
I keep seeing you places.

149
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,910
I keep seeing all these interviews.

150
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,270
How much publicity if you'd done like
in the last just a couple of weeks.

151
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,751
Uh,

152
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,700
it's been a lot and then
I'm coming off the show too.

153
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,980
So I was filming for three months.

154
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,500
I haven't been home in four months.

155
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,363
Wow.

156
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:42,880
God,

157
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,540
Damn.

158
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,860
Before that I was traveling too.

159
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:45,700
So it's been nutty.

160
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,160
How difficult is that
psychologically for you?

161
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,491
I mean,

162
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:50,680
it's one thing to go away
for an eight week camp,

163
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,270
but when you're doing that show,

164
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,440
it's like 13 weeks,

165
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:53,741
right?

166
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:54,351
And then you,

167
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:54,790
you know,

168
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,650
you're there afterwards doing publicity.

169
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,251
Well,

170
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:01,720
I should be upbringing where
structure wasn't like the thing,

171
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:04,710
it wasn't like you got up at this time
in the meal was at this time and this and

172
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:04,831
that.

173
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,390
It was like whenever you get it done.

174
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,540
So I'm not like a needing to have
like exact moments in the day.

175
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:13,500
So it works out fine for me.

176
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,700
You just accept the fact that this
is what you're doing right now.

177
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,563
That's what I'm doing.

178
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,220
I've been busy my whole life.

179
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,350
Just different kind of busy.

180
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,353
You more money.

181
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,081
It's more money.

182
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:24,370
It's more publicity.

183
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,150
It's better,

184
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,983
better busy.

185
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,191
That is a,

186
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:27,530
you know,

187
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,620
it's a funny thing that people
can really learn from it,

188
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,130
isn't it?

189
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,401
You know,

190
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:30,611
the,

191
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:30,940
the,

192
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,850
the attitude that you have
about what you just have to do,

193
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,520
it can really affect the way you feel,

194
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,900
the way your day goes,

195
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,460
the way you interact with everybody.

196
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,540
You can do the same thing and have a
great attitude about it and it really does

197
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,650
like it's a choice.

198
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:46,720
That's one of the few
choices in life that you get.

199
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,850
You can choose to just fucking this,

200
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,751
just got to deal with it.

201
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:50,530
This is what it is.

202
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,820
Not being a bitch about it.

203
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,280
Yeah.

204
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,240
I mean the bottom line is everybody's
got to do something during the day.

205
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,030
Some were pissed off about it,

206
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:00,860
a little things he has to do and some
people love all the shit that they have to

207
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,011
do.

208
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:01,820
It doesn't matter.

209
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,450
You know?

210
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,750
It's all about how you're interpreting
it and whether you're going to be

211
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,270
positive or negative
about the whole thing.

212
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:07,570
And

213
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,450
because she is busy,

214
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,510
I say it because I know that a lot of
fighters about problems with a lot of

215
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:15,800
fighters get real upset when they have
to do a big publicity tours right before

216
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,221
fights,

217
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,540
especially important fights.

218
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,220
I feel like it detracts from training.

219
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,930
And we were talking here about,

220
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:21,141
you know,

221
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:25,280
you do in 15 minute runs on the treadmill
and I just fucking jump in the shower.

222
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,753
You just gotta sneak.

223
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,631
It's hard.

224
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:28,080
Yeah.

225
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,160
That's what it takes to,

226
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:29,401
you know,

227
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:30,234
it's just like,

228
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:30,601
you know,

229
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:32,490
just enough to make sure
that I feel like crap.

230
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:32,790
Right.

231
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,623
The end of it,

232
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:33,960
you know,

233
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,481
then that's a,

234
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:35,910
that's a good worthy workout.

235
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:36,601
And you could do that.

236
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:36,721
I mean,

237
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:40,500
I could do that and probably three
minutes if I need to kick it up to like 12

238
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,334
and then like,

239
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,120
you know,

240
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,590
put it on an incline or do whatever.

241
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:43,741
I mean,

242
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:47,460
you can get yourself tired and push
herself in a short amount of time.

243
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,830
That's a crazy workout,

244
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,071
man.

245
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,551
It's really,

246
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,121
it's funny.

247
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:53,120
Everybody thinks you have to go the the
gym and workout for an hour and a half,

248
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,870
but you know,

249
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,710
you can do some crazy shit on an incline
treadmill and you're done in three

250
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:58,041
minutes.

251
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:58,420
Yeah.

252
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,253
I mean you could,

253
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,910
if you're doing it hard enough,

254
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,260
there's all sorts of shit you can do
to get yourself exhausted and just like

255
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,930
mentally tapped like in
a short period of time.

256
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:09,970
So get us sometimes utilize that.

257
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:10,721
Yeah.

258
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,890
So when you're on the road,

259
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,270
you just think like,

260
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:13,511
okay,

261
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:14,710
whatever I can get in.

262
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:15,130
I get in.

263
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,690
Do you ever do like hotel workouts?

264
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,090
I've done some hotel workouts,

265
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:20,490
but it also helps I get folks all over.

266
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,290
I mean really if we needed to,

267
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,560
we could go after this and go get
a role in or something like that.

268
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:30,561
And I've got guys all over all over the
US and all over the world now where you

269
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:31,110
know,

270
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,010
if I'm in town I'm like,

271
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,280
Hey,

272
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,270
let's get a workout in.

273
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,350
Hit Mitts,

274
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,090
get a role in sparring.

275
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:36,570
I mean,

276
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,590
everyone's always down.

277
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:37,930
Yeah,

278
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,870
that's so true.

279
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:42,080
It's one of the coolest things about
working for the UFC that I even get to do

280
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:42,570
that.

281
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,430
Like I got to train.

282
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:46,430
Like Duke Roof has trained me
a few times and telegraph days.

283
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,920
Train me a few times and
both guys are bad ass.

284
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,400
I'd ask cool dudes.

285
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,110
That's one of the things that a lot of
people don't realize about martial arts

286
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,080
is most of the people that
are good at martial arts,

287
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,520
they went through a lot of shit to
get good develops character and you're

288
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:05,450
dealing with a majority of people
who are really fucking cool.

289
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,171
You know,

290
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:08,630
like John Hackleman cool as fuck.

291
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:09,464
You know what I mean?

292
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,460
So many of these guys,

293
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,280
it Telegraaf take cool as fuck cylinders.

294
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,110
Yeah.

295
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,540
This fucking Real Greg Jackson one
the nicest guys on the planet earth.

296
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,150
Just a bunch of cool
motherfuckers in this game.

297
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,410
It's really amazing.

298
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,210
Very few people realize it.

299
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,300
They don't the the key to
having a bunch of cool people.

300
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:27,920
It's having a bunch of
people their ego in check.

301
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,753
Okay.

302
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,401
Yeah.

303
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:29,731
Why,

304
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:31,620
why is there a reason that
especially a guy like,

305
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,780
I mean you look at Duke Roufus
and you look at Della Garate,

306
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
you look at Phil nurse in Jackson,

307
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:40,350
all these guys and they've been there
like Phil's never broken his hand,

308
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:43,550
but he's got a lump like a mountain
on his hand while he's been in fights.

309
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,380
And Rufus is a,

310
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,091
from a fitting break,

311
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:47,924
his hand,

312
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,840
just little,

313
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:49,110
uh,

314
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,940
compounds over time just built up.

315
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:51,151
I mean,

316
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:52,350
these guys have been through wars.

317
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,840
Why nothing to prove.

318
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,050
They know they're bad ass and yeah,

319
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,540
they respect everyone and yeah,

320
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,690
there's the worst aspect of men is men
that aren't sure themselves want to

321
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:02,330
convince everyone around them instead,

322
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,390
you know,

323
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,223
they want to be,

324
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,450
uh,

325
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:04,631
the,

326
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:04,921
the,

327
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:08,400
the guy walks in the room and everybody
cowers and fear because they're secretly

328
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,390
fear themselves.

329
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,081
Exactly.

330
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:10,680
Yeah.

331
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,470
It's the weirdest thing in the world when
you see a guy like that get their ass

332
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,010
kicked.

333
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,461
That's right.

334
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:14,970
You know,

335
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,570
it's real.

336
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,160
Real gangsters don't flex much,

337
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:17,994
I think they call it.

338
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,490
They don't have to,

339
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,380
they don't run fast.

340
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:24,930
It's real gangsters don't
have to real gangsters,

341
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,850
whatever fucking distorted word.

342
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,630
And the 20s,

343
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,620
21st century,

344
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,660
it's become something different.

345
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,470
You know,

346
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,800
it's like something's good.

347
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:33,630
This gangster,

348
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,130
that's all that's all quoted from.

349
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:35,341
Damn.

350
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,460
It feels good to be a gangster.

351
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,021
Great Song.

352
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:44,430
One of the best songs that they would
let me come out to other songs and they

353
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:46,260
will only make you come
out to California kid.

354
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,430
I tried to do it because we
got to talk to Dana and have,

355
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:49,831
damn,

356
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:51,130
it feels good to be a gangster.

357
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,000
You come up with some
old school Geto boys.

358
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,170
Going back to Cali.

359
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:55,750
I was a dad.

360
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,610
Bras to put one.

361
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:56,821
Two.

362
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:58,500
Why can't you do on going back to Cali?

363
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,670
Is it because they have to pay?

364
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,930
Is that that it maybe?

365
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,883
No.

366
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,910
Then all about marketing.

367
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:03,580
I mean that's my,

368
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:03,990
that's my,

369
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,830
that is my song.

370
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:07,920
When people hear that going
back to Cali would be the shit.

371
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,670
It would be awesome.

372
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,630
That would be that.

373
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,413
Kelly,

374
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,840
why don't they just mash it up?

375
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,070
Have somebody mash it up for you.

376
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,120
I tried that too.

377
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,900
Dana won't let us.

378
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,800
Goddammit Dana.

379
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,540
We're going to have to talk to him.

380
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,261
That's ridiculous.

381
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,280
Going back to Cali,

382
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:22,440
it's the shit going back to Cali.

383
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,210
She'll bikini small heels tall.

384
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,030
She said she likes the ocean.

385
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,540
That's a classic.

386
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,360
Why can't you come out to that Dana wide?

387
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,350
What the fuck dude?

388
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:39,060
When I first started the WC,

389
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,690
I wanted California love and they
would not let me come out to it.

390
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,730
They had me come out to,

391
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,150
I forget what I used to come out too,

392
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,110
but they're like,

393
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,381
ah.

394
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:46,860
I was like,

395
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,300
I want to come out to California love.

396
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,260
And I always mix it up.

397
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:49,920
Right.

398
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,491
They wouldn't let me.

399
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:51,120
They wouldn't let me in.

400
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,080
Then I took a stand,

401
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,840
my first Jens Pulver fight and I told him,

402
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm coming out to California left.

403
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,020
Why did they have an argument over what
fucking music they think they know it's

404
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:01,261
cool.

405
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,650
I'm saying allow me,

406
00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:03,480
is this read?

407
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,040
This was Peter dropping,

408
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,480
bless his heart.

409
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,961
How dare you,

410
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:07,410
Peter.

411
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,010
Peter.

412
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,440
He wouldn't let me come out to
California and then it finally come out.

413
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:11,430
Somebody probably tells him,

414
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:11,760
right?

415
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,331
I'm sure.

416
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:12,660
Sure.

417
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,070
I'm sure.

418
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,501
But I was like,

419
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:13,920
look,

420
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,840
let me worry about what's cool for me.

421
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,390
And you guys just fucking
run the cameras and shit.

422
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:20,791
Well,

423
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,960
it's sort of like become your a party,

424
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:23,380
your thing.

425
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,213
No,

426
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,160
it's a pretty fucking dope song too.

427
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,821
It actually,

428
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,620
if I had to choose between
which song are better.

429
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,820
I liked that song better,

430
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,600
but it would be cool to mix
it up every once in a while.

431
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:33,434
It mix it up.

432
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,950
Yeah.

433
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,920
Well I like Rowan bias come
out till like one song,

434
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,430
you know?

435
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,091
I don't know why.

436
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:39,960
Like Mike Brown,

437
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,460
I like when it comes down to simple man.

438
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,600
I don't know why he just,

439
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,530
he always does.

440
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,300
Like when Matt Hughes
would come out to country,

441
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:46,230
boy can't survive.

442
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,640
That was part of the fun of it.

443
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,770
You know Joe Benevidez stranglehold.

444
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,870
Fucking love that song.

445
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,983
That's a,

446
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,180
that's a song that Randy came out
too when he fought mark homer.

447
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:56,340
Yeah.

448
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,150
Joseph was all upset man.

449
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,043
Oh really?

450
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,910
He's like Randy couture.

451
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,980
He jacked on Twitter and
everything and then Mike a he owes,

452
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,880
gives as a crackup.

453
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,390
He made some comments,

454
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,190
he made some comment.

455
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,360
Randy jacket his music.

456
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,051
That's funny.

457
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:15,520
So fighter can claim the music.

458
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,180
Fortunately Randy Kennedy could
do whatever the hell he wants.

459
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,901
Well not only that,

460
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,820
Randy's 48 so Randy,

461
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,530
like Ted Nugent stranglehold.

462
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:24,670
That was when Randy was young.

463
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,720
You know what I mean?

464
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,340
But he's had some other songs.

465
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,490
I mean that's fucking Badass jam.

466
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:30,880
That is.

467
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,640
Especially when you're coming
out too many black belts,

468
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,160
letting it let people know who's boss.

469
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:37,931
Randy couture.

470
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,780
If he had adopted that strategy
early on in his career,

471
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,580
I think he could have
submitted a lot of guys.

472
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,031
Oh yeah.

473
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:46,240
Once you started to like really
concentrating on with Neil melanzane on

474
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:46,710
submissions.

475
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,540
I mean he's such a an expert grappler.

476
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,720
Can we just have to go right to
that from the beginning if he like,

477
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,790
if he embraced like Brazilian Jujitsu,

478
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,400
like right away he would
be a super black belt.

479
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,360
We be ridiculous.

480
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:58,841
How about,

481
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,370
how about a guy like Mark Coleman?

482
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,060
Malcolm,

483
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,450
dude,

484
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,770
I wrote about this in my book.

485
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,391
Did you and I,

486
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:08,020
it's called use your head whatever way
you can and it's basically talks about

487
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,540
how I was at a bar in Vegas with Coleman.

488
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,413
His buddies were like,

489
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,000
oh Coleman back in the day
wouldn't headbutts were legal.

490
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,620
Nobody can be Colman

491
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,190
and Colman didn't really say anything,

492
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:22,870
but his guys were going on and he didn't,

493
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,220
he didn't like this claimant at all.

494
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:27,040
But it's tough to fuck with that
big dude on top of you head button,

495
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:27,874
the shit out.

496
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,780
This shit.

497
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,220
That is a real weapon.

498
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:30,550
Right.

499
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,660
Well how do you feel about headbutts and
elbows to the back of the head when it

500
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:34,810
strikes the back of the head?

501
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,441
Well,

502
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:37,360
if somebody's got the,

503
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,540
gotten me in a position where they can
hold me down an elbow to the back of my

504
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,260
head,

505
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,800
fuck,

506
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,520
go for it.

507
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,870
I mean I fucked up.

508
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,100
Right,

509
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,440
right,

510
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,741
right,

511
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,070
right.

512
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,810
You know what I mean?

513
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,360
What you mean?

514
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,360
It's like you get to that point
where a headbutting or an elbowing,

515
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,530
someone in the back of the head is like,

516
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,150
like the position you're in,

517
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:56,690
you probably gonna get
your ass kicked anyway.

518
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:57,524
So go ahead and do it.

519
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,121
Yeah.

520
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:58,931
So it's weird.

521
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,550
We've got a weird rule system.

522
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,241
You know,

523
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:01,371
it's,

524
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:02,440
it's kind of vague,

525
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:02,951
you know,

526
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:03,820
and then the back of the head,

527
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:04,660
it's sort of changed.

528
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,670
I had heard it was a Mohawk,

529
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,041
you know,

530
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:07,300
it was,

531
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,430
it was that you just got to touch the ear,

532
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,810
you have to touch the ear.

533
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,540
Part of it has to be like here,

534
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,730
like some part of it has to touch the ear.

535
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,080
So vague and it's,

536
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:17,381
you know,

537
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,270
and like situations like Eric Silva,

538
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:20,710
when he got disqualified in Brazil,

539
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,670
it was like that was bad.

540
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,140
That costs Chad a penalty.

541
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,980
Did it really?

542
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,191
Yeah,

543
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:29,191
because that ref got yelled at for
doing the Brazilians who wasn't in Mario

544
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,970
Yamasaki Yamasaki who's an awesome,

545
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,451
awesome,

546
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:31,780
rough,

547
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,780
but he told us in the back
of somebody grabs the cage,

548
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,790
we're deducting appoint period,

549
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:37,301
you know,

550
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:40,330
if it stops to take it right then he gets,

551
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,440
he puts himself in that position
doing the bag call where it was like,

552
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:43,960
I mean,

553
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,980
the guy won the fight.

554
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,013
It was a bad call.

555
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:46,811
You know,

556
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:51,440
it's one of those calls that you
should have the power to reverse with,

557
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:51,860
um,

558
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,220
with

559
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,750
instant replay because it was,

560
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,880
it was clear that the guy was hurt,

561
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,361
that,

562
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:57,050
you know,

563
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,883
prater was hurt.

564
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,311
He was hurt.

565
00:14:58,311 --> 00:14:59,660
Bad wasn't clear.

566
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,241
You know when you,

567
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:01,790
when you looked at it like that,

568
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,980
it should have been stopped from
strikes the back of the head.

569
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:06,890
So then you've got to play it back and
then when you played it back everybody

570
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:07,820
was like come on.

571
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,990
And it was just like maybe there was one.

572
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,180
They should,

573
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,110
I don't know why they do it.

574
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,450
It's weird when they have like rules,

575
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,560
like they just say,

576
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,760
this is just how we do it.

577
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,390
Like,

578
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,470
and this is how it's written.

579
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,181
Like that's not,

580
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:20,630
so you have some new technology.

581
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,800
The average person,

582
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,030
the average intelligent person would say,

583
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:26,810
well let's look at a video so that way
we can be sure this is a career defining

584
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:27,460
mistake.

585
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,370
Didn't they take that
away from football to,

586
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:30,430
are they reinstate it?

587
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:33,310
Cause when I was a kid I thought
there was always an instant replay.

588
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:33,971
I don't know.

589
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:35,020
I don't follow football.

590
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:35,854
I don't know.

591
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,750
Since I got laid actually

592
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,040
you wrestled all throughout high school.

593
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,150
I wrestled all throughout high school.

594
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,080
I played football too.

595
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:48,010
I was did you really was my first love
really from like third grade on up.

596
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:53,011
And I think I stopped following
football once I got laid and it was like

597
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,870
Saturday and Sunday was no
longer about watching football.

598
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,010
It was about chicks that almost cost
me my competitive taekwondo career.

599
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,650
When I started getting pussy
it was like a barely showed up.

600
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,570
Wait these girls like me cause
I'm kicking him with Das.

601
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:06,901
All right,

602
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:07,734
hold on a second.

603
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,693
Three evaluate.

604
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,220
Yeah I showed up at class wants all Tan
and my instructor's making fun of me.

605
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:14,300
I'm like what the fuck you been?

606
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,520
He knew what was up right
around the same age.

607
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,620
Pretty girlfriend followed
me everywhere I went.

608
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,670
That's awesome.

609
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,091
That's a,

610
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:23,451
that's a,

611
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,310
that's a huge distraction for athletes.

612
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,470
It is.

613
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,700
Well it can be Ken Bay.

614
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,060
How about the guy that that gets all
hung up on chicks cause there's like

615
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:31,721
different kinds of chicks.

616
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,820
There's chicks that'll be like
waiting on you hand and foot.

617
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:35,290
You don't have to worry
about I'm this and that.

618
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,860
And there's the like the chick
that you have to go watch out.

619
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:38,920
Cause if you turn your back,

620
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,970
your buddies are going
to be on top of her.

621
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,293
You gotta Watch out.

622
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,810
Those are the ones you got to watch out.

623
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:47,950
What I've seen guys that like actively
go after chicks like that and it's just

624
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:49,270
retarded ruins.

625
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,483
You know,

626
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,560
some dude's just love sabotage that.

627
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,420
A lot of it is guys also that are unsure
in their life and are subconsciously

628
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:02,290
looking for something to distract them
from all the bullshit they really should

629
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,070
be handling,

630
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,310
you know,

631
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,180
about their own life.

632
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,170
So I think it has to do with
their moms could be that too.

633
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:10,450
Like they're like going after what they,

634
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,490
what they know it.

635
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:12,130
Huh?

636
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,350
Oh your mom's like crazy and said,

637
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,203
you know,

638
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,720
well that's probably the case cause my
mom was like really nice and like real

639
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:20,980
easy going so is mine.

640
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:21,970
And what else you ask

641
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,540
but ask her high school friends.

642
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,003
Really.

643
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,993
Right?

644
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:28,920
Yeah.

645
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,441
It's a,

646
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:29,830
it's,

647
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,360
that's it.

648
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,120
That is the grand trap and picks it.

649
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,700
Picking the wrong people
to spend your time.

650
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:36,580
What the specialty or like a
relationship like you know,

651
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:39,820
like I was reading about some
guy who killed his girlfriend,

652
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,993
you know,

653
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,600
she broke up with him and he
killed her and I was thinking,

654
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,270
you know what a what a terrible
situation for that girl.

655
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:48,940
She fucked up and got
like worst case scenario,

656
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,190
one of the biggest idiots

657
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,480
in the fucking world that's
so can handle a breakup.

658
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,900
He has to go back and kill you.

659
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,390
You know what a fucking loser like that,

660
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,300
that it does like loser.

661
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,190
Then you got to look at her too.

662
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:03,680
I mean like what made her attracted
to the guy that was going to kill her?

663
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,810
I mean it's like probably violence.

664
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:07,430
I think there's a correlation there too.

665
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,061
Could be,

666
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:09,410
but it also could be youth,

667
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,891
you know?

668
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,590
I mean I've done a lot of stupid things
when I was young and they don't really

669
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,221
define me.

670
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:15,500
They just to find that I
didn't know shit at the time.

671
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,641
I mean that's the whole,

672
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:16,890
the,

673
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,590
the process of life is about,

674
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,041
you know,

675
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,390
learning from fuck ups.

676
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,440
She shouldn't have to get killed because
she had a weird thing for like some

677
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:25,790
thug life type dude.

678
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,733
Yeah,

679
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,900
I remember.

680
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,680
I mean,

681
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,020
I've seen girls get ruined.

682
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,020
I was from a small town,

683
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,630
it was like Mexicans and cowboys,

684
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,713
you know,

685
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I moved there in the seventh grade and
you'd see like a girl just like take the

686
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:40,790
wrong path at next.

687
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,640
He knows she's got like a neck tattoo
and like pregnant and like the ninth

688
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:45,474
grade.

689
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,323
That was it.

690
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,641
That's a cowboy,

691
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:48,210
right?

692
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,043
No.

693
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,350
Where did you grow up?

694
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,700
I was in Lincoln,

695
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,950
the Lincoln of Lincoln.

696
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,933
Where's Lincoln?

697
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,520
Outskirts of Sacramento.

698
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,400
I moved there in the
seventh grade and like,

699
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:02,880
you know,

700
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,760
country cruise and there
was like 7,000 people.

701
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,030
Now there's like 40,000.

702
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,010
Wow.

703
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,490
And we get a lot with a lot of crap,

704
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,170
like jumping cars out in the country.

705
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,840
We got in trouble one time,

706
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,390
uh,

707
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,590
we had off campus lunch and so we'd have,

708
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,221
you know,

709
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:20,010
in the springtime season's over
and all that kind of stuff.

710
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,820
We'd be out in the country driving
around drinking beers on the roof in like

711
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:24,840
doing crazy stuff.

712
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,050
And somebody called in the school and,

713
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,471
uh,

714
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:28,921
it was like,

715
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:29,960
we saw you Ryan,

716
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,590
we'll Craig or Jim Cannon on the,

717
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,140
on the roof of the car drinking
beers and this and that.

718
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,260
And I go back and,

719
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:38,070
and I had their principal
loved us and she's like,

720
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:40,620
we had reports that you're
drinking beers sitting on the roof.

721
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:41,340
And like,

722
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,650
we were on the roof and we
were not drinking beers.

723
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:44,430
And she's like,

724
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,121
that's what I told him.

725
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:46,050
You guys wouldn't be doing that

726
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,743
free and clear.

727
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,340
7,000 people.

728
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:51,174
What is that like?

729
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,160
That's gotta be weird
growing up in a really small,

730
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,120
that's pretty small,

731
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,520
right?

732
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:54,850
Yeah.

733
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,491
That's very funny.

734
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:56,161
You know everybody,

735
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:56,960
right?

736
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,793
Everybody know everybody.

737
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:57,960
Oh,

738
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,800
of course too.

739
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,663
That's weird.

740
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,920
I don't know anybody in my neighborhood.

741
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,411
You know what though?

742
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:02,130
It's good though.

743
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,371
I mean,

744
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:03,450
that's better.

745
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,410
I think it's good.

746
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,011
I mean,

747
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,210
everybody knows,

748
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,110
you know,

749
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,010
you can't be a slime
ball if you're slamming.

750
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,110
Everybody knows you're slimeball.

751
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,340
It's a real community.

752
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,300
It's a community and uh,

753
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,163
you're,

754
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,750
you're forced to have a conscience.

755
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,820
That's actually a interesting,

756
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,350
I always trust chicks from,

757
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,760
from New York or New Jersey.

758
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,600
Really?

759
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,433
Not Really,

760
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,120
really?

761
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,953
No.

762
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,530
Only small town girls.

763
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,840
Not only small town but you prefer,

764
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,780
I would say I,

765
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm pretty good judge of character but I
feel like over there like the girls are

766
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:39,630
dealing with guys that are like that are
a different level like the guys like on

767
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,040
on Jersey shore a little bit,

768
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:41,820
you know what I mean?

769
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,870
So they have to kind of like adapt and
become like hard and like a mild version

770
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,704
of that,

771
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,990
which is like a full on version of
like a player out in California.

772
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,440
Okay.

773
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,771
Yeah.

774
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:51,490
The the,

775
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,580
the kind of aggression that you have
to deal with on the east coast is very

776
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:55,100
different.

777
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,740
There's a lot of douchey dude's

778
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,061
yeah,

779
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:59,010
like blatantly call want to take you out,

780
00:20:59,011 --> 00:20:59,440
girl.

781
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,430
I've heard some like funny stories
and and stuff where guys are like,

782
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,870
yeah,

783
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,150
all right.

784
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,360
I grew up with those idiots.

785
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,430
You know,

786
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,780
east coast is a different vibe,

787
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:09,021
man.

788
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:09,860
It's totally different.

789
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,120
They're hardened.

790
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,810
I got my mom and my dad
calling me right now.

791
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,970
Good problem and bad problem to have.

792
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,763
It's like,

793
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,740
okay guys,

794
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,220
parents,

795
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,500
uh,

796
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:19,821
there,

797
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:20,620
there were um,

798
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,010
Kinda hippie is out of the deal.

799
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:22,660
Yeah.

800
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:22,871
Yeah.

801
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:23,830
Back in the day,

802
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:24,460
you know,

803
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,293
there,

804
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:25,841
well I was,

805
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:27,040
I made the 70s,

806
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,280
1979 and my parents were
out and I live Vista,

807
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:30,911
California,

808
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:33,820
which is like the college town
right next to Santa Barbara.

809
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,470
And they weren't going to college.

810
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:36,340
They were just chilling,

811
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:36,941
you know,

812
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:37,780
my dad was,

813
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,500
you know,

814
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,810
working odd jobs and,

815
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,770
and they actually met at
a restaurant and stuff,

816
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:45,200
but they're like part of a hippie
Christian commune and Oh good.

817
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,670
So hippie Christian College.

818
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,400
How'd they work that out?

819
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,360
I Dunno.

820
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,240
I was barely,

821
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:51,074
yeah,

822
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,321
we left.

823
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:55,880
It was like for the communes always
seemed like a great idea until some dude

824
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,210
starts fucking everybody's white,

825
00:21:59,210 --> 00:21:59,860
you know,

826
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,780
it's always that.

827
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,210
It's always starts out with a great idea.

828
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:06,030
We're going to form our home
communities is going to be beautiful

829
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,751
movie right now.

830
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,280
What's the movie that's out right now?

831
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,443
I don't know which,

832
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,740
it's hilarious though.

833
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:11,820
It's about like the calming,

834
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:15,660
like they stop and they're going to like
get married and they like car breaks

835
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:16,960
down and they'd pull into this car.

836
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,701
Oh yeah,

837
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:17,971
yeah,

838
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:18,451
yeah.

839
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:20,490
Who the fuck is in there
as a gen for Anson?

840
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:20,851
Tommy,

841
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:21,600
you remember?

842
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:21,961
Oh my God.

843
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:23,640
We're talking about
Jennifer Aniston movie.

844
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,391
Yes.

845
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:25,430
We might be a couple of quarters.

846
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,020
The legal excitedly about Jennifer Harris.

847
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,980
Is there anybody that nailed the females
genre more than Jennifer Aniston?

848
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,840
Lock that shit down.

849
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,560
If a girl tells me she wants to take
you to a Jennifer Aniston movies,

850
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:39,810
go,

851
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,040
Oh fuck.

852
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,030
You know.

853
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,800
If someone says like,

854
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,220
you're going to go to
a Meryl Streep movie,

855
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,120
that check could be anything.

856
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:46,020
Do you ever meet her Joe?

857
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,273
Meryl Streep?

858
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,420
No.

859
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,860
I saw her once in real life.

860
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,960
She had a great character.

861
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,830
She's right there.

862
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,040
I was like as close as you are to
me and Courtney Cox was there too,

863
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,930
where you're looking through a window.

864
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,251
No,

865
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:58,331
we,

866
00:22:58,331 --> 00:22:58,861
when we were on it,

867
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:00,030
when I was on NBC,

868
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:04,290
I was on the news radio and news radio
was like the redheaded stepchild of NBC.

869
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,350
They didn't get any promotion at
all until after it was canceled.

870
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,311
When it was canceled,

871
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:09,240
then it became popular.

872
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,074
It was really weird,

873
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
like through DVD sales and through,

874
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,510
um,

875
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,410
people watching it,

876
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:14,460
like on late night TV.

877
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:18,150
But we would go to these things where
you would have all the publicity things.

878
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,590
Nobody wanted to talk to us,

879
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:20,971
especially me.

880
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:22,140
Nobody gave a fuck about me.

881
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,410
I'm on the Sitcom.

882
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,510
It's barely hanging on.

883
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,800
Like at one point in time,

884
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,873
uh,

885
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,290
my friend Joe was one of the writers
would write down on his shirt or no,

886
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:31,551
I'm sorry.

887
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:31,920
I'm sorry.

888
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,210
Lou Lou Morton.

889
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,410
I don't know why I called him Joe.

890
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,363
Confusing the guys.

891
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,530
Lou Martin used to write down his shirt.

892
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:39,990
What the number was that
we were ranked on TV.

893
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,080
He came in one day and said,

894
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,660
[inaudible] 84 we were like,

895
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,000
fucking 84 were,

896
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,501
you know,

897
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:45,980
friends was

898
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,491
number one.

899
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,600
We were 84.

900
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,610
The president of NBC was on.

901
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:51,444
I like,

902
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,450
what's that Fez show that's off?

903
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,820
Or in fact,

904
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:55,550
Ron in Fez.

905
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:55,731
Yeah,

906
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:56,564
I think it was Ron and fast.

907
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,270
And he was talking about
after Phil died were,

908
00:23:59,290 --> 00:23:59,960
uh,

909
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,770
um,

910
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,270
Andy wanted more money.

911
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,200
Yeah.

912
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,180
Did you hear the whole story?

913
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,160
I've ever brought it up
cause it's a terrible story.

914
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,130
President brought it up,

915
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,671
I'm sure.

916
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:11,420
Well,

917
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,070
you know what I,

918
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,620
you know,

919
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,453
you know Andy,

920
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,181
Andy's Andy,

921
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,050
he's fucking crazy.

922
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,250
But the thing that he said,

923
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,730
yeah,

924
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,563
yeah,

925
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,700
I was on second with him.

926
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,440
That guy is nuts.

927
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,460
What happened with you and him?

928
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,683
He Cam,

929
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,160
is he openly gay?

930
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,030
I don't know.

931
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:29,864
That's a secret.

932
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,763
Oh No.

933
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,230
Oh,

934
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,970
he's on some absurd stuff to me.

935
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:35,620
One time I met him and the other time,

936
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:35,831
the,

937
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:37,510
for the first time I met him,

938
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:38,470
I was at a,

939
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,560
at a hotel downtown in La.

940
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,650
Get you to talk like right into here.

941
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,980
Yeah,

942
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,860
it'd be a lot louder.

943
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,200
Hello?

944
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,033
We can

945
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,910
both hear each of the grade,

946
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:49,450
but on the recording
people get pissed at me.

947
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,820
It was like we were there at,

948
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,663
uh,

949
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:53,941
at a,

950
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:54,100
uh,

951
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,280
just a little bar in,

952
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:56,170
in this hotel.

953
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,870
And I'm with my manager
and just kicking it.

954
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,100
He starts,

955
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,010
it's like coming on to me like hard.

956
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:03,844
And then he's like,

957
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:04,810
he's like,

958
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,260
I'm like,

959
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,310
like saying stuff.

960
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:07,990
I thought he was joking and

961
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,211
he says,

962
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:11,170
how old are you?

963
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:11,800
And I was like,

964
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,461
27.

965
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:12,731
He's like,

966
00:25:12,731 --> 00:25:14,450
you're too fucking all.

967
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,843
Like,

968
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,713
I'm like,

969
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,090
I'm like this and that.

970
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:19,924
And he's like,

971
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,420
I just like basically tick off.

972
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,190
Then the second time I met him,

973
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,910
he was with a band.

974
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,140
Does he have a band or something
or you have a band at the,

975
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:29,331

979
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:35,980
Some band there with,

980
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,210
I forget what band it was.

981
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:37,901
And they're like,

982
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:38,561

983
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:39,520

00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:14,621
Okay,

1006
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,080
well I don't know if that was a secret,

1007
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,660
but oh,

1008
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,503
he's crazy.

1009
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,880
I've worked with that guy for
five years and he's always like,

1010
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,980
you bang if you were an asshole to me.

1011
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,553
No,

1012
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,323
never banged them.

1013
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,300
We've got an inappropriate for the story.

1014
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,020
I talked to him the other
night and I was saying like,

1015
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,471
I was like,

1016
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:33,711
man,

1017
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:35,270
I want you to come back on so bad,

1018
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:37,310
but I don't know you
guys fuck out of here.

1019
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,413
What's wrong with you?

1020
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,440
He's such a nice,

1021
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:40,520
what's wrong with you dude?

1022
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:41,360
He's so awesome.

1023
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,770
You just see what he said.

1024
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,880
Did you just hear what you say

1025
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,660
with that for five days?

1026
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,740
This guy,

1027
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,491
he doesn't want it.

1028
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:49,380
He never wants to believe that anything.

1029
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:49,591
Sam,

1030
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:49,831
he's like,

1031
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:50,900
you are an asshole to me.

1032
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,100
Do you know what you were like,

1033
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:53,671
you crazy.

1034
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:54,504
Fuck.

1035
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,970
He knocked on my door in my room
and he goes open a Daria Craig.

1036
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,960
I was getting changed.

1037
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,060
I open up the door and he's like,

1038
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:04,390
you're in that fucking aren't you?

1039
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:05,390
And he had his dick out.

1040
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,233
He was like,

1041
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,970
I talked about this before,

1042
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:11,460
but what's fucked up about it
was he didn't even have the,

1043
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:12,294
fucking,

1044
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,080
didn't even,

1045
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,610
didn't even get hard first

1046
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,560
to get hard.

1047
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,490
Not even having to do this is very

1048
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,580
hard.

1049
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,590
I can understand why he was gone so crazy.

1050
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,910
He's a talented motherfucker.

1051
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,410
He was.

1052
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,580
He is is a really,

1053
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:33,720
he

1054
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,381
really funny guy.

1055
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:35,214
But he's crazy.

1056
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,930
He doesn't mean to be a bad guy,

1057
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,310
but he doesn't give a fuck.

1058
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:40,680
Which is interesting because
most people do give a fuck.

1059
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,390
So there's that element of it.

1060
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:43,010
I mean,

1061
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,530
there's a couple of people in this world
that really don't give a fuck and are

1062
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,364
entertaining,

1063
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:47,851
you know?

1064
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:48,780
And he's definitely,

1065
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,970
I really loved that level.

1066
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,700
I mean,

1067
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,390
it's just,

1068
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,800
it's just too much work,

1069
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,580
you know?

1070
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,320
I wish him the best,

1071
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,320
but it's just,

1072
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,730
I don't,

1073
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:56,971
you know,

1074
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:57,161
the,

1075
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:59,100
the one podcast we have the most plenty.

1076
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,260
When he started talking about
how attracted he was to me,

1077
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:02,650
I was so attracted to you anyway.

1078
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,423
Oh,

1079
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,240
top five podcasts of all time.

1080
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,661
Yeah,

1081
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:07,840
because you're a sick fuck.

1082
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,060
You got a problem.

1083
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:11,160
The chemistry between you two is amazing.

1084
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,210
He means that it's real amazing
being around a crazy person.

1085
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,241
Yeah.

1086
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:19,560
But somebody that you know and you know
that he's not going to go crazy on you.

1087
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,293
When I say crazy,

1088
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,841
I mean,

1089
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:22,650
like I said,

1090
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,011
he,

1091
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:23,844
I would still,

1092
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,140
you know,

1093
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,940
somebody came up with a Sitcom and
it was going to be me and Andy Dick.

1094
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,020
I would still have to consider it.

1095
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,970
That'd be the best like bosom buddies.

1096
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,480
I wouldn't,

1097
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,280
I don't want to ever do
a sit calm again though.

1098
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,971
I don't know.

1099
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:33,091
It's,

1100
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:33,400
it's,

1101
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,170
it's hard to get a guy like that a gig
unfortunately because he's made a few

1102
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:38,610
mistakes by the way.

1103
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,370
Joe,

1104
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,350
someone up or something?

1105
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,191
I don't think so.

1106
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:45,780
I think he just pulled out his dick on
numerous occasions that Dr com videos on

1107
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:46,171
Youtube.

1108
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:47,004
By the way,

1109
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,110
everyone download that guide.

1110
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,933
It's on there.

1111
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,420
It's from,

1112
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,040
it seems like it's from
another country from it.

1113
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,480
They played the episode overseas.

1114
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,320
Any episode.

1115
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,153
That's ridiculous.

1116
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,240
It's on the Internet.

1117
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,540
Yeah,

1118
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,020
that's it.

1119
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,350
Yeah.

1120
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,800
Wow.

1121
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,640
Those silly bitches,

1122
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,840
they got so greedy.

1123
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,590
They figured we'll just sell this episode
to like Denmark or something and not

1124
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:05,460
aired in America.

1125
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,070
Well in other countries there's no
problem with that because they drink that

1126
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:08,520
shit.

1127
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,730
Well that's where the thing
about fear factor is you have to,

1128
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,600
someone has to eat it in some other
part of the world for us to serve it.

1129
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,410
So like when people in New Zealand and
started drinking shots of horse calm,

1130
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,630
they would sell it at bars like as a,

1131
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:22,231
as a goof,

1132
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:26,460
like you have a cup of [inaudible] and
then you'd get Randy like let's have a

1133
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:28,510
fucking hot as a bad New Zealand accent.

1134
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,450
And it was also a horse urine.

1135
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:31,284
You never said

1136
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,860
it was actually cow urine that I never
said donkey urine because I would have to

1137
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:38,450
tell the truth.

1138
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,410
And it wasn't dark urine,

1139
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,850
but it was donkey comp
was cow and donkey Kong.

1140
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,940
Wow.

1141
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,830
Who is the test dummy for that?

1142
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:45,270
He's like,

1143
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:45,680
wow,

1144
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,650
that's really crazy.

1145
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,270
We had some people that work for him.

1146
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,830
He's under an account is working it.

1147
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,390
We had some people that
work for us that uh,

1148
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,640
had to actually do it as
well as the contestants.

1149
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,001
You know,

1150
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:00,700
we got to get people to test
it to see if it was possible.

1151
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,950
So we have PA's and you know,

1152
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,380
they would only get $100 to drink,

1153
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,080
like 24 ounces a donkey come.

1154
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,200
And I had more money on them,

1155
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:12,550
so I gave them a few hundred bucks out
of my own pocket for having to do it.

1156
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:13,211
But I was just like,

1157
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,220
this is the craziest fucking
thing I've ever seen.

1158
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,590
I had a your harsh,

1159
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,613
yeah,

1160
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,910
Andrea Summers,

1161
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:22,151
you know,

1162
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:23,980
that is a little blond.

1163
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,141
Diego,

1164
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:27,180
her and her boyfriend and if he'd be,

1165
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,790
how'd they do?

1166
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,623
How well do you do?

1167
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,790
She said she was 15
seconds away from winning.

1168
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,550
Oh really?

1169
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,383
Yeah.

1170
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,550
Why can't I remember?

1171
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,710
He has something to do with pot.

1172
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,390
You think Alpha brain or pot?

1173
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,081
I'll know.

1174
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:41,260
You know there's too many
people that I did 148 episodes.

1175
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,300
Holy Shit.

1176
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,760
There's too many people 148
episodes most of the time.

1177
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,280
Most of the time it was a,

1178
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,380
it was like six,

1179
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:50,951
eight people.

1180
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:54,040
You'd have to remember every
week four you'd get down to four,

1181
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,281
you know,

1182
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:54,790
it's like,

1183
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,530
and then the next week it
would be a whole new people.

1184
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:57,190
And I just,

1185
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,820
my memory bank would just a race,

1186
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,060
there's a thing called Dunbar's number.

1187
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,301
Oh,

1188
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:02,134
there it is.

1189
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,700
There's a thing called Dunbar's
number and a what Dunbar's number is.

1190
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,533
Um,

1191
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,350
it's uh,

1192
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,490
looking at what does that language,

1193
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,613
I said

1194
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,990
we probably shouldn't play
this dude because this is a,

1195
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:14,650
they're going to,

1196
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,270
people are going to get
sued for that or something.

1197
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,080
I assume that was the donkey come episode.

1198
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,061
Yeah.

1199
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:21,810
Just see the,

1200
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,010
like the size of the bucket
that's in front of them.

1201
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,270
We could show.

1202
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,520
I'll show it to you if
you want to watch it.

1203
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,120
And it is on TV.

1204
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,290
I mean it is on the Internet.

1205
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,210
It's pretty intense.

1206
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:31,871
Those twins,

1207
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:32,704
it doesn't belong.

1208
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,760
There were twins and there was a Brunette
twins and then two dudes that were

1209
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,051
twins.

1210
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:38,050
It was a twins episode.

1211
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,543
That's awesome.

1212
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,440
How many ounces of that 127 oh by the way,

1213
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,030
it's on more than one.

1214
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,530
Um,

1215
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:46,840
oh yeah.

1216
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,271
Cause he had one.

1217
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:48,940
It was on Twitter that
I saw her earlier to.

1218
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,950
It's on a bunch of different formats now.

1219
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,780
I knew it would come out eventually,

1220
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:53,490
but man,

1221
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:53,640
it's,

1222
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,940
Chris twins are awesome.

1223
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,741
Yeah,

1224
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:57,574
they were very hot.

1225
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,413
All of them are.

1226
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,370
It's just disturbing.

1227
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,390
I would love to have,

1228
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,460
when I have kids have twin boys,

1229
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:04,810
I would hate to have twin girls.

1230
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,793
Yeah,

1231
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,813
I know.

1232
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,721
Everywhere they go,

1233
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:08,920
someone thinking about fucking them.

1234
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,380
And you don't even have to be that hot.

1235
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:11,891
Yeah,

1236
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:12,430
let's not,

1237
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,820
let's not have this on think folks.

1238
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:16,660
If they want to find it,

1239
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:17,440
it's out there.

1240
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,980
Can we just do like just flashed it
right when they're drinking the whites?

1241
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:21,640
No,

1242
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:21,911
no,

1243
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:22,061
no,

1244
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:22,271
no.

1245
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:23,410
I just don't think we should.

1246
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,760
I don't know what the legal status of all
this stuff is and I don't know what my

1247
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:29,060
position is and

1248
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,630
don't just cause I don't
know what my position is.

1249
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:35,110
I that might be illegal for me to do.

1250
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,240
I might get sued or something.

1251
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,463
The uh,

1252
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,830
the show was because of that,

1253
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,850
which it was a good thing or the
shows canceled because of that.

1254
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:44,071
Yeah,

1255
00:32:44,071 --> 00:32:45,530
because the people,

1256
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,030
the people that have drink dog,

1257
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,690
I mean essentially they had a real hard
time finding advertisers in the first

1258
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:53,000
place and then after this got on Tmz,

1259
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:54,510
they will like get the fuck out of here.

1260
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,820
They were pretty convinced it was
going to be brought back before that.

1261
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,680
Well now with this Internet video leak,

1262
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:01,431
maybe it will be,

1263
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:02,460
maybe will become their,

1264
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,201
you know what,

1265
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:03,441
man,

1266
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,310
I'm happy it's done.

1267
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:05,180
I wouldn't do it again.

1268
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,163
I did it.

1269
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,070
I'm done.

1270
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,401
It was,

1271
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:07,870
it's,

1272
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,700
it's an actual job that
you said last time I did,

1273
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,930
but yeah.

1274
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,010
But this time,

1275
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,470
this time I'm totally
serious because I did try it.

1276
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,760
I took six years off.

1277
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,320
We'll try it again and not really anyway,

1278
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:18,741
back to you.

1279
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:19,574
And you're right.

1280
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,900
Let's talk about you man.

1281
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,890
Fucking fuck me.

1282
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:22,610
Um,

1283
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,570
tell me more about this.

1284
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:28,520
A hippie childhood cause you like grew
up with like holistic medicine and apple

1285
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:29,211
cider vinegar,

1286
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:29,860
that kind of Shit.

1287
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,371
Yeah.

1288
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:34,270
Well starting starting out was
basically in the Hippie commune,

1289
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:34,631
you know,

1290
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:35,464
like,

1291
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,100
I love this.

1292
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,933
It was like,

1293
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,823
you know,

1294
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,140
free spirited Christian,

1295
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:40,721
like everyone,

1296
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:40,841
like,

1297
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:41,290
you know,

1298
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:45,040
you go to church and it's like people
like reaching up to the sky and like

1299
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,200
people crying and stuff like that.

1300
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,370
But uh,

1301
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,020
so you can work really well.

1302
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,203
That must have been really true.

1303
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,520
Has it's called new hope,

1304
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,520
new hope church or whatever it was,

1305
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,363
didn't last.

1306
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,001
No,

1307
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:59,150
I mean that my family and
my dad's side is first,

1308
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,330
my dad's first generation American
from Holland and they're really,

1309
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,160
really strong Christians
on the dad's side.

1310
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:06,350
And my mom's side is not so much,

1311
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:06,531
you know,

1312
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:07,160
my,

1313
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,380
it's like not,

1314
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:09,681
not,

1315
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,640
not anything like that.

1316
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,710
So I think it was like
a mixture of the two.

1317
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,553
My Dad,

1318
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:13,931
you know,

1319
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:14,764
it was like,

1320
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,141
you know,

1321
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:15,521
grew up,

1322
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,400
he's the first guy,

1323
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,320
first guy from his
family to be in America.

1324
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,440
And like in the 70s it was kind of like a,

1325
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,920
a wild child and stuff like that.

1326
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:25,700
And then like born again Christian
after certain amount of time.

1327
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:30,260
So they spent like the early parts of my
childhood were in that environment and

1328
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:31,011
it kind of lasted,

1329
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:32,120
some of the stuff lasted,

1330
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:32,781
you know,

1331
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:33,920
throughout my life.

1332
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:34,370
But it was,

1333
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,470
my parents got divorced
when I was in kindergarten,

1334
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,513
so that was like,

1335
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,920
then I went back to one side,

1336
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:40,760
kind of happened at once.

1337
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:41,594
I had really not,

1338
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,650
you know.

1339
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,483
Wow.

1340
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,741
That must have been a,

1341
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:48,980
an interesting childhood to go from that.

1342
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,040
How do you go from that to being
a mixed martial arts fighter?

1343
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,230
Uh,

1344
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:57,070
well the thing is about the mentality
is just basically encouraging you to do

1345
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:58,090
whatever the heck you want.

1346
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:58,751
You know?

1347
00:34:58,751 --> 00:34:59,050
And,

1348
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,700
and my parents aren't like,

1349
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,241
you know,

1350
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:02,560
never had any mapped out.

1351
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,191
It was always like,

1352
00:35:03,191 --> 00:35:06,460
my dad's like super proud of
anything that we ever had done.

1353
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:07,480
And my mom's like,

1354
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:07,871
you know,

1355
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:09,430
always just pushing you to be,

1356
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,593
uh,

1357
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,141
you know,

1358
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:12,430
the best at whatever you do.

1359
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:14,530
So this is just what I was drawn to.

1360
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,150
I always used to watch the boxing.

1361
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,300
All my favorite movies
were a karate movies and,

1362
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:20,021
and you know,

1363
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:20,980
all that kind of stuff.

1364
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:21,340
And,

1365
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,420
and how many kids grew up with you?

1366
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,520
It was my brother and my little sister.

1367
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:26,230
My little sister is 13 when she was born.

1368
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,520
So it was just me and my brother.

1369
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:28,354
Really.

1370
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,711
She was 13 when,

1371
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:30,544
who was born?

1372
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,391
My brother,

1373
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:36,391
my sister was born when I
was 13 and I swapped it.

1374
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,323
Yeah.

1375
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,110
So what do they do now?

1376
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,660
My brother lives in
Sacramento and actually

1377
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,280
he's,

1378
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,671
he's,

1379
00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:44,790
he's an interesting case.

1380
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:49,791
He actually went to college on a
scholarship and had like a complete mental

1381
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:52,860
breakdown at the age of 21.

1382
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,760
Whoa.

1383
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,150
Yeah.

1384
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,710
So he's never really been the same.

1385
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:56,220
It's,

1386
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,751
it's kind of a,

1387
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:57,331
I actually,

1388
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:57,781
my book,

1389
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:58,800
I talk about it like,

1390
00:35:58,801 --> 00:35:59,100
uh,

1391
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,640
like the whole effect that had on
all of our lives and everything.

1392
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:03,210
But,

1393
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,043
um,

1394
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,460
he went away on a scholarship,

1395
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:07,290
was like the captain of the football team,

1396
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,430
captain of the wrestling team,

1397
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,220
went away to a Christian school,

1398
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:15,300
got recruited by this church
called International Church
of Christ and was like

1399
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:16,650
trying to live this perfect life,

1400
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:19,020
like not thinking about sex.

1401
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:20,550
He was eating less,

1402
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,840
sleeping less.

1403
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:26,841
He was getting like 25% of his money that
he's working at Nordstrom at a cafe at

1404
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:28,051
Nordstrom at the time.

1405
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:30,810
And like giving his money
away and had like a breakdown.

1406
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:31,230
Man,

1407
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,820
we don't really know
exactly what happened,

1408
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:34,100
but he's a,

1409
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,340
he works with my,

1410
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,760
with my family when he can,

1411
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:37,231
so like that.

1412
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:38,580
But it's been kind of an uphill,

1413
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,140
uphill battle for us.

1414
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,490
How many years ago was this?

1415
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,970
14 years ago or Whoa,

1416
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,071
I,

1417
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:45,090
senior year in high school.

1418
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,240
Jesus Christ.

1419
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:49,690
So he was as bad motherfucker
and then it blew a fuse.

1420
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,020
Like he hit the red line
too hard too many times.

1421
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,381
Yeah.

1422
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:53,860
We don't know

1423
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,760
exactly what happened.

1424
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:55,150
I mean,

1425
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,310
we got a call and uh,

1426
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:02,110
we got a call from his boss at work or
at Nordstrom and then a family that he

1427
00:37:02,111 --> 00:37:02,944
was staying with.

1428
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,820
We checked in and they said the,

1429
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:04,961
yeah,

1430
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:05,794
he's been,

1431
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,341
he's been,

1432
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:07,090
uh,

1433
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,080
he's lost lot of weight.

1434
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:10,510
He was like 165 pounds in high school,

1435
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,310
wrestling 165 pounds.

1436
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,720
He was like 130,

1437
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,750
120 530 pounds had been like,

1438
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,450
wasn't smiling was like washing his hands,

1439
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:22,540
obsessive Lee and my mom
and my stepdad and my,

1440
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,000
my pop and,

1441
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:29,001
and his wife all jumped in a car on New
Year's Day in 1998 and drove to La and,

1442
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,860
and brought him home.

1443
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,700
Wow.

1444
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:33,940
Yeah,

1445
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,600
it's been a crazy,

1446
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,261
if you read,

1447
00:37:35,261 --> 00:37:39,460
if you read the chapter is a chapter out
of my book that talks about just life's

1448
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:41,320
hiccups and the uncontrollable stuff.

1449
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,280
And it was,

1450
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,420
it was pretty crazy man.

1451
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,710
Also some good stories
cause after 13 years,

1452
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,700
you know,

1453
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,570
it is what it is and you just kind
of deal with what life gives you.

1454
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:53,710
And he's a funny

1455
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,103
Mofo.

1456
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,310
He's funny.

1457
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,881
He's funny.

1458
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:58,780
I mean he's still really
intelligent risks.

1459
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,150
Unpredictable and like,

1460
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,201
you know,

1461
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,070
like we've been so easy.

1462
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,000
A different guy.

1463
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,923
Oh yeah.

1464
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:04,800
100%.

1465
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,660
So like saw a fuse blew and your brother's
gone and there's a new guy there now.

1466
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,643
Pretty much.

1467
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,850
Yeah.

1468
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:12,690
And uh,

1469
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:13,621
you know,

1470
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:14,020
it's,

1471
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,280
it's,

1472
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,240
it's been a trip man.

1473
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,300
And my little sister is 13 one when I was
13 when she was born and my brother is

1474
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:23,130
two and a half years older than I am,

1475
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:25,350
so she's never really,

1476
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,350
she's never really remembered
him as I grew up with him,

1477
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:28,801
you know what I mean?

1478
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:32,490
Is My older brother and everything else
has been like a modified version of

1479
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:32,701
that.

1480
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:33,534
And I mean,

1481
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,340
he goes up and has some
times and then has some,

1482
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,510
some bad times too,

1483
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,560
but it's definitely interesting.

1484
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,730
I did.

1485
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,420
And there's nothing they can do about
something like that when it's not like is

1486
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:47,730
it a counseling issue or is it physical
aspect of the [inaudible] Stan,

1487
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,100
my mom doesn't like to
call it schizophrenia,

1488
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:52,670
but that's basically the,

1489
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,310
uh,

1490
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,310
the matrix of what what's going on is
just anything that they deem is like,

1491
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,950
don't know what it is they
throw in that category.

1492
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,140
And he definitely has different
signs throughout time of,

1493
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,540
of having that kind of,

1494
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,080
you know,

1495
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,400
schizophrenia behaviors.

1496
00:39:08,401 --> 00:39:11,010
So it's just unpredictability man.

1497
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:11,844
It's crazy.

1498
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,710
You live a wild,

1499
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:15,000
crazy fucking life.

1500
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,040
You're a professional cage fighter.

1501
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,480
Do you ever wonder like,

1502
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:18,751
you know,

1503
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:20,700
I know that just from,

1504
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,193
obviously I've never,

1505
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,060
I never fought in MMA,

1506
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,140
but I know from seeing all the fucking
championship fights that I've seen,

1507
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:30,150
all the high pressure
situations that I've seen,

1508
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:35,151
like the toll that it must have on your
psyche for a lot of dudes is pretty

1509
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:36,900
fucking incredible.

1510
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,600
Do you ever like see your brother and go,

1511
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,380
you know,

1512
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:40,710
this,

1513
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,570
is this possible that
this could happen to me?

1514
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:43,860
Could I blow a fuse too?

1515
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:44,631
Um,

1516
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:46,190
it is possible for anybody.

1517
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,133
You didn't think so.

1518
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,650
Oh yeah.

1519
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:47,990
Yeah,

1520
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,561
definitely.

1521
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:48,861
I mean,

1522
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:49,694
I think,

1523
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,663
uh,

1524
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,760
do you worry about it?

1525
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,630
No,

1526
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,200
no,

1527
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,321
no.

1528
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:56,540
You can't walk around worried
about life in general.

1529
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,040
He never leave the room.

1530
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,330
If I had a sister that was
a cuckoo for cocoa puffs,

1531
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,080
I'll go,

1532
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,621
God damn,

1533
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:03,940
I might be fucking crazy too.

1534
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,350
I might be in denial,

1535
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,000
you know,

1536
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,490
I might just be at
least you're successful.

1537
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:09,851
Crazy.

1538
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:10,391
You know what I mean?

1539
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:10,870
Who knows.

1540
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,381
But well,

1541
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:13,000
maybe your brother should get into comedy.

1542
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,860
It sounds like every comedian.

1543
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,940
Irresponsible.

1544
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,870
Hilarious.

1545
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,800
He's definitely has his moments lost
his shit because work was too fucking

1546
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:21,520
crazy.

1547
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,020
That sounds like a comedian man.

1548
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,010
And you said he's funny.

1549
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,080
He is that dude in the standup comedy.

1550
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,180
You're in northern California
and plenty of places to do it.

1551
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,320
You'd have to beat my bro.

1552
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:30,040
I mean there's,

1553
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,460
there's a ease.

1554
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:31,751
Ease,

1555
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:32,920
an interesting cat man.

1556
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,340
Yeah.

1557
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:33,671
Yeah.

1558
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:34,630
And we all love him.

1559
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,823
And uh,

1560
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,723
I dunno if he could,

1561
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,900
he could definitely.

1562
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:38,734
Uh,

1563
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,630
he could definitely have a couple moments.

1564
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:42,250
I'm going to pull up some
videos of him on the phone,

1565
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:43,084
actually.

1566
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:44,723
Does he work?

1567
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,600
He does works periodically,

1568
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:48,130
but it's just when he can't,

1569
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:49,570
cause it's just unpredictable.

1570
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:53,080
There's times where he'll go like a
whole year where things are straight for

1571
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:53,260
him,

1572
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,940
too much stimulus or happen
or even sometimes a year.

1573
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,843
And he just kind of had,

1574
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,500
so it's almost like he
really did red line.

1575
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:01,334
His brain.

1576
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,223
Yeah.

1577
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:02,890
Yeah.

1578
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,550
Wow.

1579
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,840
And we don't know what happened.

1580
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:05,141
I mean,

1581
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:05,974
we don't,

1582
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:06,903
as far as

1583
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,760
you know,

1584
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,330
when you,

1585
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,510
when you see guys like
the highest level of any,

1586
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,111
any sport,

1587
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:13,400
especially when it comes to like,

1588
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:14,060
um,

1589
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,230
wrestling or anything where it's like
super ultra competitive and you hear

1590
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:20,180
stories of a guy like a Dan Gable,

1591
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:20,811
you know,

1592
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,240
you hear stories about a guy
who he was a little crazy.

1593
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,130
Fucking gay was crazy.

1594
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,940
Yeah.

1595
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,580
I mean that guy paid the
price for it physically too.

1596
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:33,110
Like today he's got hip replacements
and his knees are shot and you know,

1597
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:33,501
yeah,

1598
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:34,040
for sure.

1599
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,330
You have you ever read up on him?

1600
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,230
He know about his sister and
all that kind of horrible,

1601
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,213
she was murdered,

1602
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,390
murdered by her neighbor,

1603
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,400
raped and murdered and stuff like that.

1604
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,040
And to heat.

1605
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,410
That was what drove him.

1606
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,670
He was a demon.

1607
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,780
That guy was possessed.

1608
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,970
You ever see those videos
of him when he was younger?

1609
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,261
I mean,

1610
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:51,170
we'll talk about it,

1611
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:51,831
you know,

1612
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:53,630
and like she's fucking terrifying.

1613
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,683
I was terrified.

1614
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,511
I wrestle.

1615
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:57,220
I wrestled at Uc Davis and we spent,

1616
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,083
uh,

1617
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,020
you know,

1618
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,010
we had a couple of different tournaments
where an Iowa and we went to Iowa.

1619
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:06,340
He was retired from coaching
and wasn't competing.

1620
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,580
Just old Dan Gable and we're in the room
working out and he's in there in a full

1621
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:17,071
sweat suit with the hood up and he's
drilling double legs on this dummy against

1622
00:42:17,561 --> 00:42:18,130
the wall,

1623
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:18,910
just drilling.

1624
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,240
Bam,

1625
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:19,720
Bam.

1626
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,510
He gets on the bike and he's
like just pushing himself on the,

1627
00:42:22,511 --> 00:42:23,344
on the,

1628
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,870
on the stationary bike
and just going crazy.

1629
00:42:25,871 --> 00:42:26,800
No one else's in the room.

1630
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:27,634
It's just him.

1631
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,990
The guy's just like,

1632
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,183
he's on it.

1633
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,320
Jesus Christ.

1634
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,500
He's never letting it go.

1635
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,710
However,

1636
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,470
I think trilon double legs.

1637
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,041
How old was he?

1638
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:38,270
Like 60 yeah.

1639
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:43,271
At least Jesus Christ's 60 year
old dudes shooting doubles,

1640
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,850
drilling them with sweatsuits on

1641
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:46,821
figure.

1642
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:47,654
If you get,

1643
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,501
you're in a,

1644
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,191
in a repetition.

1645
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:49,791
I'm the same way.

1646
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,120
If I'm,

1647
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,460
if I'm not working out
for a period of time,

1648
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,930
it just doesn't feel right.

1649
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,891
You know what I mean?

1650
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:55,551
It feels weird.

1651
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:59,000
It's probably like some people were
smoking cigarettes or you know,

1652
00:42:59,001 --> 00:42:59,930
whatever else.

1653
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,550
The,

1654
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:05,550
the routine is become like you don't
feel yourself unless you're like putting

1655
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:07,190
your body feel a little something.

1656
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,270
And I'll be the same way.

1657
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,410
I don't feel balanced.

1658
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:11,690
I don't trust myself if
I don't work out hard,

1659
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,351
if I,

1660
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:13,220
if I work out hard,

1661
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:15,260
I feel like my brain is able to,

1662
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,410
to react to things on an even field.

1663
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,360
Whereas if I'm stressed,

1664
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:22,160
like if I haven't worked out in
a couple of days and I'm all,

1665
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,300
it's all built up,

1666
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,420
you got think you can over react to
things because your brain is looking for

1667
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:28,130
some fucking something to see.

1668
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,380
I got to get rid of this
pressure that's been building up.

1669
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:30,840
Yeah.

1670
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,461
It's weird.

1671
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:32,300
It's weird.

1672
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,440
It's weird the way,

1673
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:34,220
uh,

1674
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,510
I mean it's just routine.

1675
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:36,020
You know,

1676
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,500
it's like,

1677
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,101
it's like a,

1678
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:38,230
it's like an OCD type,

1679
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,330
but I'm not by any,

1680
00:43:39,331 --> 00:43:41,090
any means like an OCD type of person.

1681
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:41,630
I like,

1682
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,121
like I said,

1683
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:42,350
I don't,

1684
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,600
I'm not great at structure and I'm good.

1685
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:46,520
I'm good at sticking to a game plan,

1686
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:50,300
but like I could sleep in
the car and this car seat,

1687
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,960
I could sleep on the floor and I don't
need to like go through a routine,

1688
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:59,170
but some people like need to have
the little things that they do right.

1689
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,280
They don't feel right in my,

1690
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:04,430
I think is just about a certain amount
of energy that I have to exert to the day

1691
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,690
or else I can't sleep.

1692
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:06,524
Right.

1693
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,660
That's interesting.

1694
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,040
Do you think that that is a routine
thing or do you think that your body just

1695
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,440
requires that because
you're mean you're your,

1696
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,060
your body is essentially a race car?

1697
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:15,560
Yeah,

1698
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,790
I think my body requires,

1699
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:19,730
I mean I think I have a certain amount
of energy that I needed to get out.

1700
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,370
If I get myself thinking about
something too late in the,

1701
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:22,791
in the,

1702
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:25,280
in the night or you know,

1703
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,070
like watch sparring or
watch something on my,

1704
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,120
the in a fight,

1705
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,560
I'm like amped up and ready.

1706
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,260
Right.

1707
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:31,921
That's a problem.

1708
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:32,161
Right?

1709
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:33,600
You have to time that shit out.

1710
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:33,841
Yeah.

1711
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:34,800
You got a time and I'm,

1712
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:35,940
I've been blowing it,

1713
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,010
especially with time in Vegas.

1714
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,340
It's like I just found myself
not getting enough sleep,

1715
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:42,060
but you know,

1716
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,420
it's like not wanting to go to bed
but having to get up in the morning.

1717
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,630
Do you ever sleep in
the hyperbaric chamber?

1718
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:50,330
I know you've used it several times and
it's one of the things I really wanted

1719
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:51,021
to ask you about,

1720
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,490
cause I'm kind of fascinated by it.

1721
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,330
The results of the hyperbaric
chamber are pretty spectacular.

1722
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:56,651
Yeah.

1723
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:57,371
They're crazy.

1724
00:44:57,371 --> 00:44:57,591
And I,

1725
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:57,970
I've,

1726
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,650
I've gone in there and
slept a couple of times,

1727
00:44:59,651 --> 00:45:00,480
but it's only,

1728
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:00,710
you know,

1729
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,260
you only want to do it a
certain amount of time.

1730
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,580
It certain amount of,

1731
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,090
uh,

1732
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:04,871
length of time,

1733
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:05,171
you know,

1734
00:45:05,171 --> 00:45:08,920
it's like an hour and a half for this
certain time sheet kind of treatment.

1735
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:09,880
It's an hour for,

1736
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:10,511
uh,

1737
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:12,220
other types of treatments is dangerous.

1738
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,091
It's not dangerous.

1739
00:45:13,091 --> 00:45:13,750
But,

1740
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,583
uh,

1741
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,011
I mean,

1742
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:15,610
I think it,

1743
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,210
it's,

1744
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,200
it's something that can,

1745
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:18,730
can he mess with you a little bit?

1746
00:45:18,731 --> 00:45:21,310
Like when you're doing
the hyperbaric chamber,

1747
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:22,931
nice face.

1748
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:23,590
He meant,

1749
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,450
I'm thinking about trying it and now,

1750
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:25,661
but,

1751
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:26,494
uh,

1752
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,420
when they do the change of,

1753
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,100
of whatever the pressures in there,

1754
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,650
it feels like you're going
up and down in a plane.

1755
00:45:32,651 --> 00:45:36,760
They can feel your ears like clicking and
stuff like that and you blow them out.

1756
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,520
And when they bring
the pressure back down,

1757
00:45:39,521 --> 00:45:41,800
you can feel them popping
and stuff like that also.

1758
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,101
So,

1759
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:42,251
I mean,

1760
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:43,720
you can feel something's happening.

1761
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,770
But the trippiest thing about
the hyperbaric chamber was,

1762
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:48,071
you know,

1763
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:48,970
I started going in,

1764
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:50,680
when I broke my hands against Brown,

1765
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,800
I broke my right hand and then I
dislocated my thumb on the left.

1766
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:57,690
And so that was a crazy fight and
the really impressive fight on your,

1767
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,730
on your behalf because you broke
your hand in the first round,

1768
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,510
you know,

1769
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,710
and you went back and you're like,

1770
00:46:02,711 --> 00:46:03,570
a broke my fucking head.

1771
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:04,180
And then you're like,

1772
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:04,500
oh,

1773
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,291
they're both shot.

1774
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:05,741
And then you're like,

1775
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:06,130
all right,

1776
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,480
well it's elbows and kicks.

1777
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,503
We'll just do this.

1778
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,720
But for three fucking rounds hard.

1779
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:11,440
Well,

1780
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,420
you broken the both of them in the first,

1781
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,550
I broke the,

1782
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,443
the,

1783
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:17,320
the first one in the first round,

1784
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:18,340
so four rounds of that.

1785
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:20,210
And then the third round I dislocated my

1786
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,000
oh wow.

1787
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,890
And a championship fight and you know,

1788
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:23,724
and you fighting,

1789
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:24,120
you know,

1790
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,240
the first guy to take your
title in this crazy fight.

1791
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:27,811
Yeah.

1792
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:28,710
And it was uphill.

1793
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:29,251
Wait too,

1794
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:31,320
because they didn't have 35

1795
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,480
when 35 when you decided
to drop down to 35 you,

1796
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,600
this is like your home now.

1797
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:37,080
You don't,

1798
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,190
you don't feel like,

1799
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:39,140
I'm like,

1800
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,661
you know,

1801
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:41,250
at 135 pounds,

1802
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,260
this is like the perfect amount of weight.

1803
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:43,860
You Cut.

1804
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,281
Perfect.

1805
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:44,491
You're,

1806
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:48,030
you're physically big as big
as anybody in the division.

1807
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:48,570
Yeah.

1808
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:48,891
That's,

1809
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,210
that's the thing with 40 fives.

1810
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:50,721
I mean,

1811
00:46:50,721 --> 00:46:51,560
people don't understand.

1812
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:54,050
It's like we've got a lot
of new people in the sport.

1813
00:46:54,051 --> 00:46:55,520
They don't understand the history of it.

1814
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,110
They don't understand that.

1815
00:46:57,111 --> 00:46:58,160
When I first started fighting,

1816
00:46:58,161 --> 00:46:59,870
I was fighting the Indian casinos.

1817
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,630
There was no sanctioning body.

1818
00:47:02,631 --> 00:47:03,590
I was wearing shoes.

1819
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:04,880
You can need people in the head.

1820
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,050
I saw you fighting one of those.

1821
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:11,051
I saw you fighting the king of the
cage and a casino Indian casinos then

1822
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,320
and then you know,

1823
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,850
there was no opportunity
for me to find 135 pounds.

1824
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:16,301
I would have,

1825
00:47:16,301 --> 00:47:20,860
I was only 148 when I first
started fighting and I was
fighting one 55 and then

1826
00:47:20,861 --> 00:47:21,220
I,

1827
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,810
I made a stand and said I'm going to
fight at one 45 but that was like making a

1828
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:26,680
stand to do that.

1829
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:30,460
And I became a world champion
up there and you know,

1830
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:34,810
after that it was like I was good enough
to be right there for another title

1831
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:35,051
shot.

1832
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:35,650
I was,

1833
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,650
I was able to beat the next contenders
and be competitive enough to get those

1834
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:42,610
out of shots and I'm never
going to turn that down.

1835
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,490
I could gone to 35 is a long time ago,

1836
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,540
but I was like,

1837
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,680
I'm not missing opportunities.

1838
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:49,210
I want to fight Jose Aldo own a fight.

1839
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:49,721
Mike Brown.

1840
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:50,554
I want to say,

1841
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,640
you know these guys,

1842
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:53,020
even though they're bigger than I am,

1843
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,000
how much bigger was all done than you?

1844
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,650
I talked to him.

1845
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:01,000
He said he tries to stay right under
one 70 and I'm about one 54 wow.

1846
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,110
That's a lot of fucking way.

1847
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:08,010
We'd one 66 in the ring in the ring
and I would want about one 53 when did

1848
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,090
before my phone's big dude.

1849
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:11,030
He's,

1850
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,310
he's smaller now though.

1851
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:13,140
He said,

1852
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,310
was it harder for him to make that cut?

1853
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,210
Oh yeah.

1854
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:16,570
Yeah.

1855
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:17,410
So you get older,

1856
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:19,300
it's harder and harder
to dehydrate yourself,

1857
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:19,570
right?

1858
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,200
Yeah.

1859
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,033
What is the,

1860
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,341
what do you,

1861
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:22,960
what are you cutting to get to 35?

1862
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:23,891
Uh,

1863
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:25,600
I'm cutting about 21 pounds.

1864
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,190
Jesus Christ.

1865
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,510
And when you're,

1866
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:28,931
you know,

1867
00:48:28,931 --> 00:48:31,300
when you're talking
about 135 pound result,

1868
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:31,481
you know,

1869
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:31,830
that's,

1870
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,730
that's a large percentage.

1871
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,560
That's not like a 265 pounder.

1872
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:36,911
Cotton,

1873
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:37,744
20 pounds.

1874
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,913
That's a lot.

1875
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,340
You know,

1876
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,070
Brock Lesnar cut 20 pounds to make to 65.

1877
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,970
That's a lot.

1878
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,700
But look at the size of that motherfucker
and then look at the size of you.

1879
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,300
So you're cutting your dehydrate
nice shit out of yourself.

1880
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:49,900
Yeah,

1881
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,580
I mean well I've got it down to a
science because I work out so much.

1882
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,160
My weight fluctuates like you know,

1883
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:59,200
five to eight pounds in a day anyways.

1884
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:02,080
Like depending on what I've had to eat
and what my workouts are like and stuff

1885
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:02,710
like that.

1886
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,830
So I swing like that like drastically.

1887
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:06,580
Anyways.

1888
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,170
So it's just about tricking your body,

1889
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:08,621
you know,

1890
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:11,440
cause it's like how much
sodium you have in your body,

1891
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:12,910
how many electrolytes and stuff like that.

1892
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,490
What is it going on Day
Jessica and your stomach.

1893
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:20,670
So if you like treat yourself like a
race car when it comes to the training

1894
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:22,300
thing and once you're down to wait,

1895
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,330
you can really like gear
up just for workout,

1896
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:30,390
go on to empty and then either go back
up from there or go back down from there.

1897
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,190
And that's where the tricky part gets.

1898
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,640
And that's where I've been doing it
for a long time and I have an advantage

1899
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,500
because I know my body,

1900
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,220
you know,

1901
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:44,170
and it's am I put on 17 pounds
after weighing 13 hours?

1902
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,710
It what percentage of your
body is that at 135 pounds.

1903
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,491
I'm an idiot.

1904
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:51,460
You got to do tell Tom
even ask Brian to do it.

1905
00:49:51,461 --> 00:49:51,851
He looked at me.

1906
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:54,970
I'm going to have my good
Vietnamese American buddy over here.

1907
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:55,961
Statistics.

1908
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:56,321
Tami,

1909
00:49:56,321 --> 00:49:57,154
please.

1910
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,080
Then I'm roles.

1911
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,980
It's like a massive amount of body weight.

1912
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:00,800
Yeah,

1913
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,570
it's,

1914
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,440
I mean the,

1915
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:05,530
I put too much on the ever done now
over logical did the first time.

1916
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,340
Yeah.

1917
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,240
The first time I did I put too much weight
on and then I didn't eat much during

1918
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:10,510
the,

1919
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,460
the,

1920
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,120
the hours before the fight and it's like
woke up and I was like bloated and I

1921
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:16,470
was like,

1922
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:16,990
all right.

1923
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:17,510
I didn't eat,

1924
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:20,230
but luckily like an hour before I went on,

1925
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:21,460
I started to feel normal again.

1926
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:22,450
That was against music.

1927
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:23,890
Gawky wow.

1928
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,610
How Wa,

1929
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,260
how much of a pain in the ass is that?

1930
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:28,160
That whole process of rehydrating

1931
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,510
yourself and trying to feel healthy again
because I would imagine that when you

1932
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,560
cut 21 pounds,

1933
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:35,510
like when you're on the scale that day,

1934
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,310
you must feel fucking terrible.

1935
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:38,323
Yes,

1936
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,980
it's a correct.

1937
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,510
I've seen guys wear,

1938
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:42,890
they look like they're ready to die.

1939
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:44,500
Luder

1940
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:44,651
well,

1941
00:50:44,651 --> 00:50:47,830
I stopped and I drink that
coconut before anything else.

1942
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:48,400
I'm like,

1943
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,780
you need nothing else matters.

1944
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,070
I'm going to get this.

1945
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,191
He's a lecturer.

1946
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:54,100
Lights in this stuff in my body now

1947
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,410
you're barely hanging on.

1948
00:50:55,411 --> 00:50:56,220
Right.

1949
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,090
It's so crazy.

1950
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,210
It's like an event in
and of itself though.

1951
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:00,044
The weight cut.

1952
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,660
I was there when Travis Luder miss
weighed against Anderson Silva.

1953
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,120
I have never seen a dude
look closer to death.

1954
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,600
Travis.

1955
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,920
His lips were chapped.

1956
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,000
All the water,

1957
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:09,541
the moisture,

1958
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:10,860
it's sucked out of his lips.

1959
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:15,390
His whole body was completely dehydrated
and he wasn't even walking towards the

1960
00:51:15,391 --> 00:51:15,841
scale.

1961
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:18,970
This is after he had missed the weight
and he was coming back to try to turn it

1962
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,780
to try to make it and he shuffling.

1963
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,760
He couldn't even walk you a shuffling.

1964
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:26,190
His face was sunken in and then he quit.

1965
00:51:26,191 --> 00:51:26,401
He said,

1966
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:26,970
I can't do it.

1967
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:27,430
I can't do,

1968
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:27,721
I'm done.

1969
00:51:27,721 --> 00:51:29,200
This is all I can lose their life.

1970
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:29,550
You have,

1971
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,600
you have another hour,

1972
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,520
you have another hour if you'd
like to try to lose the weight.

1973
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:32,731
He's like,

1974
00:51:32,731 --> 00:51:33,564
I can't do it.

1975
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:33,971
Yeah.

1976
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:35,970
We had one of our guys in
Brazil did that and he,

1977
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:36,804
he uh,

1978
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,180
Eddie hoke from Alaska and uh,

1979
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,080
he got down to like less
than half a pound over.

1980
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,880
But that half nine I was in the,

1981
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,410
I was in the sauna in the workout
room with him for like seven hours.

1982
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,600
He like getting in,

1983
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,280
getting out and I thought you give
him a big pep talk about like,

1984
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,250
he was like moping around like shadowbox.

1985
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:56,531
I'm like,

1986
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:57,340
look dude,

1987
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,780
you got to hit a mental switch.

1988
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,220
He was three pounds over doing this.

1989
00:52:00,221 --> 00:52:00,431
I said,

1990
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:03,640
you got to hit a mental
switch now and start moving.

1991
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,110
You can't be sitting in the sauna.

1992
00:52:05,111 --> 00:52:06,970
You can't be moping around it here.

1993
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:08,140
Like if you want to lose this weight,

1994
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:08,974
you got to do it.

1995
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:09,610
And then,

1996
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:12,250
so that was a push to get them
to lose that last three pounds.

1997
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:16,720
And he got down to a little bit over a
half and it was like nothing was coming

1998
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:16,961
off.

1999
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:18,610
You can no spit coming out.

2000
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,000
Oh,

2001
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,833
who's this crazy?

2002
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,330
That is so scary,

2003
00:52:21,331 --> 00:52:22,020
man.

2004
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:26,700
It's so scary that you're basically
bringing yourself on the door of death and

2005
00:52:26,701 --> 00:52:29,100
then you got to have a cage fight 24 hour,

2006
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,810
27 hours later.

2007
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,930
I feel like,

2008
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:32,980
I feel like it's not,

2009
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,360
it's not that bad for me.

2010
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:39,070
I I could 21 pounds from
where I'm like heavy,

2011
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,250
like Super Janky.

2012
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,690
But when I'm in your leanest
prime winter in shape,

2013
00:52:43,691 --> 00:52:44,050
when I'm,

2014
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:44,530
when I'm,

2015
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,680
when I'm trying to watch my weight and
keep my weight within within like a

2016
00:52:47,681 --> 00:52:48,460
striking range,

2017
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:53,460
I'm about one 5,152 and 53 maybe and
then back down to like 48 to 53 you know,

2018
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:56,500
so that's what,

2019
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,650
so at 48 the lowest for 13 off.

2020
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:00,161
Yeah,

2021
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:00,971
it's 13 off.

2022
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:03,160
And then from there there's the cut and I,

2023
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:05,970
and I'm like real smart
about sodium intake and,

2024
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,001
and things like that.

2025
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:10,540
I'll have like I won't drink water like
a lot of guys do this whole water flush

2026
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:11,050
thing,

2027
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:15,880
I don't do the waterflood I do because
a pound of water was the same amount of

2028
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,940
as a pound of Gatorade or or coconut
water or a Kombucha or something like that

2029
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,020
and you're getting stuff out of that.

2030
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:25,120
So if I'm going to drink a pound of fluid,

2031
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,990
I'm going to have something
positive come out of that.

2032
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,930
Some energy in something
that that gives my body,

2033
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:31,351
you know,

2034
00:53:31,351 --> 00:53:32,184
something to work with.

2035
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,440
That's very interesting.

2036
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:34,610
So you don't drink a lot of water,

2037
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,130
you drank water and all
this other stuff as well?

2038
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,820
I drink,

2039
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,061
yeah.

2040
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:43,061
I drink fluids with purpose and
that helps me get the most out of,

2041
00:53:43,161 --> 00:53:43,971
have a little bit of energy.

2042
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,020
I feel good when I'm,

2043
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:48,050
when I'm cutting weight all the
way until like the day of the,

2044
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,280
the actual way in.

2045
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,960
And then it's like,

2046
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:51,321
okay,

2047
00:53:51,321 --> 00:53:53,270
the last four pounds really sucks,

2048
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:58,040
but it's like it comes off and then I
feel fine right afterwards as soon as they

2049
00:53:58,041 --> 00:53:58,970
get something back into me.

2050
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,580
But it's really knowing how
to manipulate your body.

2051
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:02,990
Do you use the same principles?

2052
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:03,411
I mean there's,

2053
00:54:03,411 --> 00:54:07,700
there's something going on with this
where guys drink a massive amount of water

2054
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:08,630
up until,

2055
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,210
you know,

2056
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:09,790
is it,

2057
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:13,490
is it the same principle that you use
just with Kombucha and coconut water and

2058
00:54:13,491 --> 00:54:14,090
all that stuff?

2059
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,380
You drink massive amount of fluid.

2060
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,360
I wouldn't say that.

2061
00:54:16,361 --> 00:54:16,930
So,

2062
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:17,531
so it's like this,

2063
00:54:17,531 --> 00:54:18,730
you can get dehydrated.

2064
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,001
For me,

2065
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:21,310
they're having too much
sodium or not enough sodium,

2066
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:21,760
right?

2067
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,590
So if you have not enough sodium,

2068
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,670
you get dehydrated.

2069
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,960
As much fluid as you have,

2070
00:54:25,961 --> 00:54:27,350
your body's not going to retain any yet.

2071
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,780
It was like the osmosis where,

2072
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:29,321
you know,

2073
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:32,740
water will filtrate and go to your body
wherever the sodium electrolytes and

2074
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:33,730
wherever it needs to fill in.

2075
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,020
You don't have any of that.

2076
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,980
There's nothing drawn.

2077
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,050
The water in your body will
just go straight through you.

2078
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,050
So I kind of go with that.

2079
00:54:41,051 --> 00:54:41,201
Like,

2080
00:54:41,201 --> 00:54:42,790
I'll cut down on sodium quite a bit,

2081
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,960
but I'll have like sugars.

2082
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:46,030
I'll have like a,

2083
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:49,510
like some sort of chill mixes that I
make myself with like black licorice,

2084
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,020
uh,

2085
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,040
ginger snaps.

2086
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:51,850
I'll have,

2087
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:52,510
uh,

2088
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,940
like a bunch of like whole
nuts and stuff like that.

2089
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,840
CAROB chips.

2090
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,400
So there's like sugar in there,

2091
00:54:57,401 --> 00:54:59,560
but there's also like some
protein and some fiber.

2092
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,060
And then I'll have coconut water and
coconut meat from the inside of the baby

2093
00:55:04,061 --> 00:55:04,601
coconuts.

2094
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:09,090
And then I'll have like a
little piece of fish or um,

2095
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,170
like smoked salmon,

2096
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,440
something to get a
little bit of sodium in.

2097
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:11,611
Yeah.

2098
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:12,340
And then,

2099
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:12,791
and then,

2100
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:13,420
uh,

2101
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:13,781
you know,

2102
00:55:13,781 --> 00:55:15,250
whatever I drink fluid wise,

2103
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,430
it's like a Kombucha is good
for your digestive tract.

2104
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:19,264
It's good.

2105
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:21,970
Like helps you break food
down and keeps things.

2106
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,813
Probiotic,

2107
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,711
probiotic.

2108
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:24,670
It same with yogurt.

2109
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,620
So I'll have like that kind of stuff.

2110
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,480
And then egg whites in egg whites,

2111
00:55:28,481 --> 00:55:32,110
make sure your body doesn't break down
muscle and you're getting all the rest of

2112
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:33,520
stuff to run everything through you.

2113
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,230
And it's kind of like your body's not
taking up any of the fluids that you're

2114
00:55:38,231 --> 00:55:38,591
putting in.

2115
00:55:38,591 --> 00:55:42,730
It's just taking what it needs and
then you're going to go lose it again.

2116
00:55:42,731 --> 00:55:44,320
And then you can either
go up or down from there.

2117
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,050
Is that your standard diet?

2118
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:46,330
The,

2119
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,380
when you get down to like a certain
point way cutting the hell this is,

2120
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,273
this is all you eat.

2121
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:50,941
Yeah,

2122
00:55:50,941 --> 00:55:51,511
pretty much.

2123
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:52,590
And I'll mix it up.

2124
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:52,901
You know,

2125
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:53,700
it,

2126
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,020
my diet isn't very,

2127
00:55:55,021 --> 00:55:55,590
very,

2128
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,380
very a ton from when I am
in him not cutting weight.

2129
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:00,030
I just like eat more or less.

2130
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:02,730
And then like consider the
sodium thing quite a bit,

2131
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:04,560
which is like a trip.

2132
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,600
That's gotta be a weird
fucking dance isn't it?

2133
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:09,591
Yeah it is.

2134
00:56:09,591 --> 00:56:11,390
But when you know your body,

2135
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,080
I mean I've done this since,

2136
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:13,933
uh,

2137
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,060
I mean I remember cutting
weight in the eighth grade,

2138
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:21,290
didn't know what the heck I was doing
and then I didn't cut weight my freshman

2139
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:25,330
or sophomore year and then junior and
senior year and then all through college.

2140
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,950
Is there a way to cut it out of,

2141
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:29,290
of the sport or is it just
a part of sport forever?

2142
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,830
You could have,

2143
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,200
you could have like a two hour weigh in,

2144
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,270
but,

2145
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,330
but dudes would still try.

2146
00:56:35,331 --> 00:56:36,080
Right.

2147
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,740
What had happened,

2148
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,300
and this is what happened
in college with me,

2149
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:42,560
is you start out doing a real strict diet
and cutting weight and then you've got

2150
00:56:42,561 --> 00:56:44,450
a season where it's like,

2151
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,710
uh,

2152
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,620
six months out of the year where
you're cutting this weight.

2153
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:51,480
And what happens is you just start
losing muscle and you downsize your,

2154
00:56:51,481 --> 00:56:52,460
your body anyways.

2155
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,140
So this is better because athletes
are doing it two to three,

2156
00:56:57,141 --> 00:56:58,370
maybe four times a year.

2157
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:03,200
And you can just train just specifically
for that fight and then you kit to

2158
00:57:03,201 --> 00:57:04,450
maintain your muscle,

2159
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,080
your muscle mass and things like that.

2160
00:57:06,081 --> 00:57:07,280
Cause you can bring it right back.

2161
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,560
But what happens in a long season,

2162
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:14,060
or like if people need to downsize
and compete within a two hour period,

2163
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,740
those is downsize their muscle.

2164
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,080
So it'd be like the same thing.

2165
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,330
So dues was still lose weight anywhere,

2166
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,231
did lose weight,

2167
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:23,510
but to be over a more dramatic time.

2168
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,620
Um,

2169
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,900
and I mean there's certainly that will,

2170
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:27,201
yeah,

2171
00:57:27,201 --> 00:57:27,561
they are.

2172
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:29,840
They're trying to get people to
weigh in right before they compete.

2173
00:57:29,841 --> 00:57:31,100
The one deals I think does that right?

2174
00:57:31,101 --> 00:57:31,850
Yeah.

2175
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,250
They weigh in right before
that's not the head trauma.

2176
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:38,390
The thing about striking that makes it
dangerous is a head trauma was on fluid

2177
00:57:38,391 --> 00:57:39,224
in the brain.

2178
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,633
That's a,

2179
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,540
none of the deaths that have occurred in
boxing have occurred in the heavyweight

2180
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:45,300
division.

2181
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,600
They've all a occurred in
light of weight divisions.

2182
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:48,050
Really?

2183
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:48,411
Yeah.

2184
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:51,530
And the idea is that those guys were
all cutting weight and when they,

2185
00:57:51,531 --> 00:57:52,010
uh,

2186
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,210
the guys that are getting hurt,

2187
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:54,260
like Gerald Mcclellan,

2188
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:54,470
well,

2189
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:55,610
he's a famous wake cutter,

2190
00:57:55,611 --> 00:57:56,630
used to cut a lot of weight,

2191
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:57,320
you know,

2192
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:57,610
that,

2193
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:58,080
that,

2194
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,530
that plays a part that's
not the only factor,

2195
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:00,921
but it,

2196
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:01,190
uh,

2197
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:02,120
that it plays a part.

2198
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:06,790
I actually went to a speech to the doctor
in Sacramento gave about that and he,

2199
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,920
he had me as a guest to
listen to everything and,

2200
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,280
and it makes sense.

2201
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:10,490
Yeah.

2202
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,500
I mean your body is held in place by,

2203
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:17,390
but your brain is held in place by a
bunch of fluid and if you're losing a big

2204
00:58:17,391 --> 00:58:19,190
percentage of your fluid from your body,

2205
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:20,900
some of it's probably
coming from your head.

2206
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,330
Do you replenish with ivs?

2207
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,080
Uh,

2208
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,680
I do.

2209
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:24,880
Yeah,

2210
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,030
you have to a bag in half.

2211
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,080
That's what's happened the
first time I made 35 uh,

2212
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:30,943
I,

2213
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:34,010
I did too much of the ivy
had like almost two bags.

2214
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,031
It is too much now.

2215
00:58:35,031 --> 00:58:36,710
I do like a bag and like a quarter.

2216
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,770
What a crazy process man.

2217
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,510
It's pharmacy.

2218
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,990
It's a totally different thing.

2219
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,890
Concentrate on while you're
concentrating on a professional cage.

2220
00:58:45,891 --> 00:58:47,270
Fight against a trained killer

2221
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:47,791
dude.

2222
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:48,624
It's nuts.

2223
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,411
But you know what,

2224
00:58:49,411 --> 00:58:49,591
it's,

2225
00:58:49,591 --> 00:58:50,970
it's to stay competitive.

2226
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,710
And it's funny cause
when I got into fighting,

2227
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,000
they,

2228
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,890
I told the guys I was training with,

2229
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,090
I said I want to go,

2230
00:58:57,091 --> 00:58:59,610
I want to fight one 30
fives and they're like,

2231
00:58:59,611 --> 00:59:01,410
we don't have one 35 and I was like,

2232
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,930
well what about one 45 second?

2233
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,850
I wouldn't have one 45 but it,

2234
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,230
it really turned out to
be something good for me.

2235
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:07,951
You know,

2236
00:59:07,951 --> 00:59:08,220
I,

2237
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:11,280
because I was competing
when I was healthy,

2238
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,870
I just felt like fighting.

2239
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,340
I couldn't imagine going through a season
like wrestling and wanting to get in a

2240
00:59:17,341 --> 00:59:20,430
fight when I was 133 pounds,

2241
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,290
you know?

2242
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,790
He did not feel like fighting anybody.

2243
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:23,361
You feel like,

2244
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:23,631
like,

2245
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:24,464
all right,

2246
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:26,270
go ahead and take my
girlfriend and my money.

2247
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,870
I'm going to sit over
here and think about food.

2248
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:32,910
It's a horrible thing.

2249
00:59:32,911 --> 00:59:36,670
And during adolescence to that
kids go through and you know,

2250
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:37,970
wrestling is the fucking,

2251
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,590
they're starving themselves
while they're growing.

2252
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,021
See,

2253
00:59:40,021 --> 00:59:42,960
I didn't start wrestling until the
eighth grade and then after that I didn't

2254
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:47,340
even know that I was supposed to be
cutting weight as a freshman and sophomore

2255
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,090
because our team socked in and it was
like I was the best guy on the team

2256
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:51,661
anyways.

2257
00:59:51,661 --> 00:59:53,160
And so it was like,

2258
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,750
just go wherever I wanted.

2259
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,584
You know?

2260
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,520
It's pretty funny.

2261
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,880
When did you decide that you were
going to make a transition to MMA?

2262
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,650
I decided they actually did,

2263
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:07,230
they did an interview with me after my
senior year in college and they asked me,

2264
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,563
um,

2265
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,780
what was next for me.

2266
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,590
And I've never been a guy
that has planned much,

2267
01:00:13,591 --> 01:00:13,771
you know,

2268
01:00:13,771 --> 01:00:15,990
I've just kind of like
just gone with the flow,

2269
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,190
whatever I felt like doing,

2270
01:00:17,191 --> 01:00:17,760
doing.

2271
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,930
But I remember saying,

2272
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:21,030
I think I'm going to try
out mixed martial arts.

2273
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:23,910
And there's actually an
article in the newspaper,

2274
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,320
like the College newspaper.

2275
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:25,561
I said,

2276
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:26,400
I think I'm gonna try this,

2277
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,710
this mixed martial arts thing out,

2278
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,790
you know,

2279
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:30,181
and,

2280
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:31,014
uh,

2281
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:31,660
it,

2282
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,540
it was illegal in California.

2283
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:35,520
And I started coaching at Uc Davis.

2284
01:00:35,521 --> 01:00:40,521
I was getting paid like $7,000 a year
as a full time job busing tables at a,

2285
01:00:41,821 --> 01:00:42,350
at all

2286
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,360
$10,000 a year.

2287
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,310
I thought it was a lot of money.

2288
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:45,790
I mean,

2289
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:46,990
I knew it wasn't a lot of money,

2290
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:49,120
but it was more money than I was used to,

2291
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:49,781
you know,

2292
01:00:49,781 --> 01:00:51,280
and I didn't feel like I was working.

2293
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,910
And I started a little business called
top line coaching and I went and got some

2294
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,744
uh,

2295
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,260
uh,

2296
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,520
like a little elementary school group
of kids that I started training.

2297
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,840
And then I had a,

2298
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:02,680
uh,

2299
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,670
some camps that I,

2300
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:05,320
that I put on the college that I,

2301
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,080
that my coach let me put
them under my business name.

2302
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:13,380
And so I actually was working like 16,

2303
01:01:13,661 --> 01:01:16,030
17 hour days in addition to training.

2304
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:21,031
I was doing my full time Gig at Uc Davis
and I was coaching kids afterwards and

2305
01:01:21,071 --> 01:01:24,100
then I would go home and I'd bus
tables at this little bar called ink.

2306
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:25,000
And My,

2307
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,060
my rent was like 220 bucks
a month living there.

2308
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,080
Wow.

2309
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:29,913
And uh,

2310
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:30,491
yeah,

2311
01:01:30,491 --> 01:01:31,151
it was crazy,

2312
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:31,510
man.

2313
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,710
And I started fighting.

2314
01:01:32,711 --> 01:01:35,170
At that time I had my
emergency teaching credential.

2315
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:36,370
I was going to start teaching some,

2316
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:36,911
you know,

2317
01:01:36,911 --> 01:01:38,320
be a substitute teacher a little bit,

2318
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:39,250
but I took a fight,

2319
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:42,160
made 450 bucks or 500 bucks,

2320
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:46,720
200 to show 200 to win a 100
bucks for selling tickets.

2321
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:47,554
And I was like,

2322
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,690
make that in like a week,

2323
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,051
you know?

2324
01:01:50,051 --> 01:01:52,400
That was like my monthly salary was,

2325
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:52,811
was that,

2326
01:01:52,811 --> 01:01:53,090
so I,

2327
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:53,520
that's,

2328
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,700
that's when I hit the switch.

2329
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,990
Wow.

2330
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,003
Yeah.

2331
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,720
That's crazy.

2332
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,650
Holy Shit.

2333
01:01:58,651 --> 01:01:59,550
And what year was this?

2334
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,800
2003 you were how old?

2335
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:04,050
I was 23 wow.

2336
01:02:04,051 --> 01:02:04,884
So you had like,

2337
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:05,670
it was,

2338
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:06,600
it was like,

2339
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,580
it was more of a financial thing that,

2340
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,770
that sent to you in,

2341
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:10,311
well,

2342
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:11,570
I could've got a job.

2343
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,880
I just graduated from a major university
and I could have actually got a job.

2344
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:17,960
It wasn't a financial thing.

2345
01:02:17,961 --> 01:02:20,430
It was like not worrying
about financial thing,

2346
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,540
you know?

2347
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,410
And it was like,

2348
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:22,741
dude,

2349
01:02:22,741 --> 01:02:23,401
this was awesome.

2350
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:24,090
I was like,

2351
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:24,990
my first fight,

2352
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,190
minute and a half,

2353
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:27,024
I made,

2354
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,600
you know,

2355
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,100
almost 500 bucks.

2356
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,810
I didn't tell my mom about it.

2357
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:31,891
I didn't tell her about it.

2358
01:02:31,891 --> 01:02:32,611
She found out,

2359
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:33,540
like I said,

2360
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,010
I told her like two weeks later,

2361
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:36,690
I said I had the little tape and I go,

2362
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:36,900
mom,

2363
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,890
I got something to show you.

2364
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:38,760
And I,

2365
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,630
and I sat her down,

2366
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:40,920
I put the tape in and she's like,

2367
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,420
what the heck?

2368
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:42,751
And she's,

2369
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:44,040
I'm in 23 at this point.

2370
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:45,720
I've lived out of the
House since I was 18,

2371
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:45,970
you know,

2372
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:46,803
around,

2373
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:47,940
and she's like,

2374
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:50,310
please tell me you're not
going to do this again.

2375
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:51,050
And I'm like,

2376
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:51,331
you know,

2377
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:52,610
kind of smirking and,

2378
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:53,783
and she's like,

2379
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:54,290
you're,

2380
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:56,520
I will pay you not to do this,

2381
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,340
that.

2382
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,173
And she's,

2383
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,053
and I said,

2384
01:02:59,170 --> 01:02:59,791
I said,

2385
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:03,690
it's going to be 500 bucks
per minute and a half.

2386
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:05,940
That's what you're
going to need to pay me.

2387
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:06,511
No.

2388
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:08,870
Did you have a lot of
striking training in that?

2389
01:03:08,871 --> 01:03:09,541
But at that point,

2390
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:10,530
was it all just rustling?

2391
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:10,981
No,

2392
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:12,420
but I thought I was bad ass,

2393
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,060
which is important.

2394
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,890
You got to see if you look up my,

2395
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:17,724
uh,

2396
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,110
my second fight,

2397
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,190
my first fight,

2398
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,260
I tried to hold it together.

2399
01:03:21,261 --> 01:03:24,750
I like came out southpaw and I started
firing straight street punches and the

2400
01:03:24,751 --> 01:03:26,550
guy came to take me down and my,

2401
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:28,170
and it ended so fast.

2402
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:30,480
I was like amped up for
like an hour afterwards.

2403
01:03:30,481 --> 01:03:30,690
Like,

2404
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:30,821
ah,

2405
01:03:30,821 --> 01:03:32,070
I wish it would've lasted longer.

2406
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:32,850
I wish he had done this.

2407
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,870
I wish I would've done that.

2408
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:34,651
And,

2409
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:35,340
uh,

2410
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:35,731
so I said,

2411
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:36,211
next fight,

2412
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:37,560
I'm just going to strike.

2413
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:39,240
And I had this guy,

2414
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,110
uh,

2415
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:41,430
who was like,

2416
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:45,180
had been training quite a bit and knew
what he was doing but was just not a

2417
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:45,661
tough guy.

2418
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:45,841
Like,

2419
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:47,850
I mean if you look at
him and you look at me,

2420
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:48,781
you know,

2421
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:50,640
not to judge books by the cover,

2422
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:51,870
you knew I was going to win,

2423
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:52,810
you know.

2424
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:54,900
And so I just kept it
standing for seven minutes.

2425
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:56,700
I beat the crap out of this guy.

2426
01:03:56,701 --> 01:03:56,940
It's,

2427
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:57,930
it's horrible.

2428
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,280
And it's like cat and
mouse like punching him.

2429
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:06,480
I'm trying to help him up like re rear
end back like this and running at him

2430
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:10,710
with a like a like a fist and
throwing haymakers it was crazy.

2431
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,070
And you were going down training.

2432
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,880
How much striking training
had you had by them?

2433
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,550
Like about my first fight,

2434
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:18,450
about a month,

2435
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:19,050
a month,

2436
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:20,160
but not real training.

2437
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:20,971
Just like no one.

2438
01:04:20,971 --> 01:04:23,100
I was going to throw punches
and like working on myself.

2439
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:23,821
And then,

2440
01:04:23,821 --> 01:04:24,240
uh,

2441
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,560
you just worked with yourself?

2442
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:25,891
I mean,

2443
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:27,440
just like I was,

2444
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:27,741
I mean,

2445
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:28,860
I've been in fights before.

2446
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,780
I knew I could hit hard.

2447
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:35,100
I have like a heavy right hand and I've
been a huge boxing fan my whole life,

2448
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:36,240
so I knew what it looked like.

2449
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,680
There was coordinated guy,

2450
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:38,430
you know,

2451
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:38,851
so,

2452
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:39,390
uh,

2453
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:41,460
I just thought no one would
be able to beat me up.

2454
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:41,731
I'm like,

2455
01:04:41,731 --> 01:04:44,970
there's no way really
anybody's going to beat me up.

2456
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:45,331
Wow.

2457
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:46,660
That's pretty fucking confident.

2458
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,630
What was it like when
you had your first loss?

2459
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:50,490
Uh,

2460
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,920
it didn't hurt,

2461
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,750
but it was a little disorienting.

2462
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,610
I went in and uh,

2463
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:58,920
it was against Tyson Griffin.

2464
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:03,420
We were fighting in a parking lot of a
casino up in northern California and it

2465
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:04,254
was like,

2466
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,690
it was like hot out.

2467
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,220
And um,

2468
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,440
I went in there in the first round,

2469
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:15,740
I do like a superman punch and then I
need him in the face and I hit an inside

2470
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:22,350
trip and I brought my head to the
outside and the Kingdom of the gladiator

2471
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:22,871
challenge.

2472
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:24,450
Guys were having trouble with the Cajun.

2473
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:27,640
They were lazy and so they
took the black covering,

2474
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:31,360
but they didn't put the padding over
the steel on the bottom of the cage.

2475
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,640
So I did a head dive as I was taking,

2476
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:34,503
uh,

2477
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,900
Tyson Griffin down and
just slammed into the cage.

2478
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:38,620
Oh my God.

2479
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:42,670
And my head just started gushing blood
and seven staples after the fight,

2480
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:44,080
it was eight seconds into the fight.

2481
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:45,700
So eight seconds in the fight,

2482
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:49,510
I'm just blood's gushing down my face
and I've got them in a guillotine and I'm

2483
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:52,210
shaking my head like
this and I'm telling her,

2484
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,400
Herb's a ref and I'm like,

2485
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:55,150
herb,

2486
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:55,760
my,

2487
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,300
I'm busted open or I'm bleeding
or something like that.

2488
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,500
So he breaks us in a,

2489
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:00,820
in a guillotine position.

2490
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,200
And I was odd to shape.

2491
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:02,471
I mean,

2492
01:06:02,471 --> 01:06:07,471
I was all discombobulated and Ted
Williams comes in and I had sold like 300

2493
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:08,141
tickets.

2494
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:10,300
This is house making money at
this time was selling tickets.

2495
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:15,310
I'd sold like 300 tickets to get here
is eight seconds into the fight and the

2496
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:20,780
doctor comes in who end up being a
vet and Ted Williams comes in and he,

2497
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,400
the doctor's looking at me and Ted goes,

2498
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:25,240
is he okay?

2499
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,440
And uh,

2500
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:27,731
now he said,

2501
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:28,510
are you okay?

2502
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:29,121
The doctor said,

2503
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:29,381
I said,

2504
01:06:29,381 --> 01:06:30,011
I'm not sure.

2505
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:30,844
You tell me,

2506
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:31,870
you know,

2507
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:32,703
and uh,

2508
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:33,551
and then Ted said,

2509
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:34,001
he's fine,

2510
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:34,361
he's fine,

2511
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:35,194
he's fine.

2512
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,110
And they just started the fight again
and then I don't remember anything.

2513
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:39,700
I was just going crazy.

2514
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:40,570
It was like a wild,

2515
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:44,410
it was like a herb says one of the
best fights that guys have never seen.

2516
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:47,320
It was just like a knockdown
drag out back and forth.

2517
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:47,830
And I,

2518
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,630
my Jujitsu instructor at the time,

2519
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:50,464
Casio didn't,

2520
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:51,640
didn't make it to the fight.

2521
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,830
I just have my striking
coach at that time,

2522
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:56,980
day Merino wool and I didn't
know what was going on.

2523
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,380
It was like a close fight the
first and the second rounds,

2524
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:00,670
uh,

2525
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:01,450
you know,

2526
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,910
it was probably one on
one for rounds and he,

2527
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:04,190
my,

2528
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:04,960
my coach is like,

2529
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,040
you got to knock them out.

2530
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,320
I don't have any knockout,

2531
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:09,670
like any street series
knockouts at this point.

2532
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,130
So I go in at the beginning of the third
round and just do like a jumping right

2533
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,320
hand and he throws like a straight right,

2534
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:20,200
right on the button and
drops me and I didn't go out.

2535
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:20,441
But,

2536
01:07:20,441 --> 01:07:20,681
uh,

2537
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:21,490
I was like,

2538
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:23,710
like getting pounded on in.

2539
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:24,544
The ref called it.

2540
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,490
You were probably so fucked
up from the first shot.

2541
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,500
You were able to fight three rounds.

2542
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:31,090
That's what ties to the bar.

2543
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,390
A metal I Tyson,

2544
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:37,810
I had had like a little
beef after that for a while.

2545
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,100
It was just kind of like,

2546
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:41,530
because he felt like I was making excuses.

2547
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:41,771
I'm like,

2548
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:44,260
I didn't make it cause I was
telling the story like yeah,

2549
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:47,110
I got seven staples in my head
after the fight and this and that.

2550
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:49,030
I was like fighting like a wild animal.

2551
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,073
And he's like,

2552
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,510
his guys from his hometown were
saying I was making excuses.

2553
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:53,050
I'm like,

2554
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,610
I understand the lost the fight.

2555
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,140
I'm just telling what really happened.

2556
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:56,771
Not Saying,

2557
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:58,090
oh we like had a fever or anything.

2558
01:07:58,091 --> 01:08:01,060
I really hit my head and he was huge.

2559
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:01,691
You know,

2560
01:08:01,691 --> 01:08:04,630
he's got about 40 pounds
on me walking US Christ.

2561
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,290
Yeah.

2562
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:08,230
So wild west man of MMA though.

2563
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,190
Those were the days,

2564
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:09,371
man.

2565
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:11,740
Those king in the cage events
were pretty fucking nuts,

2566
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:12,150
ma'am.

2567
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:12,820
Yeah.

2568
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,140
Indian casino parking lot.

2569
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:15,250
They would do it if it rained.

2570
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,400
Did you ever see wet and wild?

2571
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,450
Yes.

2572
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:18,590
What the fuck is that

2573
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:18,911
dude?

2574
01:08:18,911 --> 01:08:22,360
That was them just not wanting to give
money back to people and just let it,

2575
01:08:22,361 --> 01:08:22,740
yeah.

2576
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:23,160
Yeah.

2577
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:27,510
They had came in a casino
in the pouring rain,

2578
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:28,200
I mean,

2579
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,760
and it was a plastic cover,

2580
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:30,790
so you'd go up,

2581
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,910
guys would go out and try to throw kicks
and just fly through the air and in

2582
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:34,783
their heads.

2583
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,360
That is so crazy.

2584
01:08:36,361 --> 01:08:37,740
A lot of people didn't fight.

2585
01:08:37,741 --> 01:08:38,011
They said,

2586
01:08:38,011 --> 01:08:38,491
fuck this.

2587
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:39,020
I'm going.

2588
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,010
That would have been smart.

2589
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:40,730
I wouldn't have,

2590
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:41,541
I wouldn't have gone home,

2591
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:42,770
but I would have wished I would have.

2592
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:43,604
You know,

2593
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:48,230
you get some stupid stupid
shit would like your,

2594
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:49,640
when you're hungry,

2595
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,720
like probably for anything,

2596
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:51,470
you know,

2597
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:52,760
just hungry for,

2598
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:53,700
for,

2599
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,830
for success.

2600
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,320
They're like willing to do
anything before it even.

2601
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:58,610
You see that in these levels.

2602
01:08:58,611 --> 01:08:59,444
It's just nuts.

2603
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:00,111
Yeah.

2604
01:09:00,111 --> 01:09:00,710
That shit.

2605
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:01,700
That's fucked up.

2606
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:01,971
I mean,

2607
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,580
that's why one of the reasons
why you need regulatory bodies,

2608
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:05,450
he needs someone to come and go,

2609
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:06,170
no asshole.

2610
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,540
You're not going to have a
fucking outdoor fight in the rain.

2611
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,340
What are you going to do
of lightening comes in?

2612
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:11,360
Is that part of the battle?

2613
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:11,631
Yeah,

2614
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:11,841
no,

2615
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:12,380
no.

2616
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,370
At least if they're in the rain,

2617
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:14,690
they should be able to fight in mud

2618
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:17,743
or something.

2619
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:18,771
It's just,

2620
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:19,604
it's too,

2621
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:20,960
too animalistic.

2622
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:21,800
You know what,

2623
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,840
we talked about our elbows
to the back of the head.

2624
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:24,813
Um,

2625
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,840
do you like the rules
the way they are now?

2626
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:27,830
Like do you think that,

2627
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:28,220
uh,

2628
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:28,610
that,

2629
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:31,530
that everything's good or do you think
that we should have like needs to a

2630
01:09:31,531 --> 01:09:33,650
downed opponent or is anything
you would like to add?

2631
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,610
I think you should be able to do a nice
sit down opponent and even kick a guy

2632
01:09:36,611 --> 01:09:38,110
while he's down because I mean,

2633
01:09:38,111 --> 01:09:38,944
this is a fight.

2634
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:44,200
The thing that's so intriguing about our
sport is that this is what would really

2635
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:47,470
happen if you mess with someone
and they know what they're doing.

2636
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,330
This is what you're going
to have to deal with.

2637
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:51,700
And it is still that.

2638
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:52,893
But um,

2639
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,381
you know,

2640
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:53,980
it's just,

2641
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:58,800
it's like one of those things where
you gotta you gotta look out for people

2642
01:09:58,830 --> 01:09:59,291
safety,

2643
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,330
but you don't want
people abusing the rules.

2644
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:04,720
Like putting their knee down all of a
sudden and like putting their hand down.

2645
01:10:04,721 --> 01:10:06,100
It's like if you're in a bad position,

2646
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,440
you should be able to have to react.

2647
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:12,340
The only other argument I've heard that's
a against stomps and soccer ticks and

2648
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:13,520
the ground is the cage.

2649
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,241
They're like,

2650
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:16,460
if you're going to have stops
and soccer kicks on the ground,

2651
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:19,850
you should have a ropes so you could
slide in the ropes to avoid it.

2652
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,090
You shouldn't have a spot where they
can shove your head up against it and

2653
01:10:23,091 --> 01:10:26,240
soccer kick you in the head
because it's not natural.

2654
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,021
You should be,

2655
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:28,130
you should be able to move around.

2656
01:10:28,131 --> 01:10:30,590
He shouldn't be able to use
the cage as an actual weapon,

2657
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:34,220
which there's an argument in that
that at least in pride they could,

2658
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,560
they could see the kick
common that they can move,

2659
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:37,191
they can move.

2660
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,110
Like if you're running into a wall,

2661
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:39,761
you can't move.

2662
01:10:39,761 --> 01:10:41,240
You just going to get
soccer kicked in the head.

2663
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:41,691
You know,

2664
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:42,081
you could say,

2665
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:42,261
well,

2666
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:44,150
you should never let yourself
get into that position,

2667
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:48,320
but it seems almost like you're using
the cage in a way that it probably isn't

2668
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:48,870
that sad.

2669
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:49,350
Yeah,

2670
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,183
I could see that.

2671
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:50,880
And I mean,

2672
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,391
but in,

2673
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,290
in reality,

2674
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,670
and I always go back to,

2675
01:10:53,671 --> 01:10:58,671
and that's why I was good on Dominic
because this is really like the gladiator

2676
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:02,350
days where it's like a simulated
fight to the Dominick Cruz

2677
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:04,420
for folks who don't know is your,

2678
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,000
uh,

2679
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,611
last,

2680
01:11:05,611 --> 01:11:06,330
uh,

2681
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:07,540
last time you guys fought,

2682
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:08,890
it was a very close to decision.

2683
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,570
A lot of people thought
you could have won.

2684
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,650
A lot of people thought he could have.

2685
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:11,731
Well,

2686
01:11:11,731 --> 01:11:12,041
we were very,

2687
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:15,240
very close fight and you guys
were set to fight in the rematch.

2688
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,110
But uh,

2689
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:18,150
Dominic recently blew out his knee,

2690
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:20,730
so now you're going to be
fighting Hanan Barao but yeah,

2691
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:22,350
you've Cree criticized Dominic style.

2692
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:23,250
It's like point fighting,

2693
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:23,530
right?

2694
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,990
I mean his,

2695
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:29,410
you can't really criticize him too
much other than the fact that it's not,

2696
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:29,700
I don't,

2697
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,620
I feel like he could have
potential to finish some guys,

2698
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:34,420
but he doesn't go for that.

2699
01:11:34,421 --> 01:11:36,190
And this is really a simulated fight.

2700
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:36,491
I mean,

2701
01:11:36,491 --> 01:11:37,540
this is a fight to the death.

2702
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:39,370
It's in Diaz says the same thing.

2703
01:11:39,371 --> 01:11:41,590
It's like if we were in
a fight to the death,

2704
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:42,401
you know,

2705
01:11:42,401 --> 01:11:43,150
who'd win,

2706
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:43,570
right.

2707
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:44,070
You know,

2708
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,550
and,

2709
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,550
and at,

2710
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,393
at that,

2711
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,320
on that level,

2712
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:50,620
like I'd like to see guys
try to finish all the time.

2713
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:50,951
Right.

2714
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:51,410
You know,

2715
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:53,560
like play by the rules and this and that,

2716
01:11:53,561 --> 01:11:53,741
you know,

2717
01:11:53,741 --> 01:11:54,280
like,

2718
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,210
like tag somebody and like it,

2719
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:57,340
it looks like you're hurting him.

2720
01:11:57,341 --> 01:12:00,220
And I feel like Dominic has
potential to do some damage.

2721
01:12:00,221 --> 01:12:01,890
He just doesn't know how or doesn't try,

2722
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:02,710
you know,

2723
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:03,550
to finish.

2724
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,290
It's a mentality thing.

2725
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:06,150
Okay.

2726
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:07,440
Now this,

2727
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:11,790
this style of fighting where
you just go by and get points,

2728
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:12,120
but,

2729
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:12,751
but still,

2730
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:14,090
when I mean it,

2731
01:12:14,091 --> 01:12:16,110
it can be effective for guys.

2732
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:17,970
And what's it all for?

2733
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:18,451
I mean,

2734
01:12:18,451 --> 01:12:18,960
how do you,

2735
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,220
how do you make a distinction?

2736
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:22,350
Like when do you decide
whether it's about,

2737
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,150
it's all about being as entertaining
as possible or it's all about winning.

2738
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,490
Like it seems to me that there's like,

2739
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,080
I just don't feel like that's winning.

2740
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:32,523
Ah,

2741
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:33,521
so to you,

2742
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:35,320
it's not honorable to try to like,

2743
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,610
just point your way through it.

2744
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:37,444
You're trying to,

2745
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:38,480
Dominic for example,

2746
01:12:38,481 --> 01:12:38,930
is not,

2747
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,610
it's not dishonorable.

2748
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,211
I mean he's,

2749
01:12:41,211 --> 01:12:42,044
he's trying,

2750
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:44,960
he's trying to do damage and
maybe just doesn't have it in him.

2751
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:45,794
I don't know.

2752
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:47,570
But the,

2753
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:49,540
he makes fun of the size of his hands.

2754
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:50,120
You know,

2755
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:50,861
it makes fun of it.

2756
01:12:50,861 --> 01:12:52,340
We did an interview and he's say,

2757
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,440
I got a bitch hands,

2758
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:53,891
you know,

2759
01:12:53,891 --> 01:12:54,880
cause he broke his hand.

2760
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:55,180
Yeah.

2761
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:55,570
That's,

2762
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:56,321
that's something,

2763
01:12:56,321 --> 01:12:57,520
there's nothing you can do about that.

2764
01:12:57,521 --> 01:12:57,680
Right.

2765
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,340
I mean

2766
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,390
there's nothing you can do about that.

2767
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,030
But I mean,

2768
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,220
I'm not taking anything away,

2769
01:13:01,221 --> 01:13:02,060
but I would say,

2770
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:02,710
you know,

2771
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:02,941
the,

2772
01:13:02,941 --> 01:13:07,880
the purpose of this sport is
like to finish and do damage.

2773
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:12,910
And you can't really knock a guy
who's really great at what he does,

2774
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:13,690
you know?

2775
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:13,890
And,

2776
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,050
and he is trying,

2777
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:15,231
I mean,

2778
01:13:15,231 --> 01:13:17,780
I guess if you get a
guy that that crumbles,

2779
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,070
he'd probably finish him,

2780
01:13:19,071 --> 01:13:19,401
you know?

2781
01:13:19,401 --> 01:13:20,150
But,

2782
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:20,870
uh,

2783
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:23,000
I like to go in with a mentality of,

2784
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:27,380
of let's do war that's brow
is going to try to finish me.

2785
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:28,730
I'm going to try to finish brow,

2786
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,420
you know,

2787
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,090
and it's going to be till the,

2788
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:32,060
till the bitter end,

2789
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:32,841
you know,

2790
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:35,990
it's not going to be like pitter
pattering and stuff like that.

2791
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,850
That's going to be a sick fight.

2792
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,031
That's going to be a second.

2793
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:39,180
Yeah,

2794
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,000
I was looking at it and it's crazy.

2795
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:43,490
It's like he has,

2796
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,580
I think he has more fights in idea.

2797
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,910
He's got 13 k,

2798
01:13:48,911 --> 01:13:49,031
O,

2799
01:13:49,031 --> 01:13:49,201
t.

2800
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:49,730
K.

2801
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:49,730
O.

2802
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:49,740
S.

2803
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:54,380
He's got six submissions and he's got
like nine decisions and I've got 14

2804
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,430
submissions,

2805
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:57,230
a seven t,

2806
01:13:57,231 --> 01:13:57,411
k,

2807
01:13:57,411 --> 01:13:57,660
O,

2808
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,221
k Ios,

2809
01:13:58,221 --> 01:13:59,390
and like four decisions.

2810
01:13:59,391 --> 01:14:00,890
There's preferred this fight.

2811
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,860
It doesn't mean if you had a choice
between this fight in the fight with

2812
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:04,540
Dominick Cruz,

2813
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,060
I want this.

2814
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:06,830
I want the fight that fans want to see.

2815
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:09,620
And I think people afterwards,

2816
01:14:09,621 --> 01:14:10,700
I'm going to prefer this fight,

2817
01:14:10,701 --> 01:14:13,750
but we'll prefer the Dominick Cruz fight.

2818
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,360
So I want to give people
what they want to see in,

2819
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,661
you know,

2820
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:19,750
Dominic and I have a history that we
need to solve and stuff like that.

2821
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:20,051
I mean,

2822
01:14:20,051 --> 01:14:21,310
I was really looking
forward to fighting him.

2823
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,410
But as far as an exciting fight goes,

2824
01:14:23,411 --> 01:14:25,900
this is going to be a crazy fight.

2825
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,110
It's a funny thing,

2826
01:14:27,111 --> 01:14:28,250
this Dominic thing,

2827
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:28,670
uh,

2828
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,031
because,

2829
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:29,101
uh,

2830
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:31,310
I've never seen you be
upset by an opponent.

2831
01:14:31,311 --> 01:14:33,300
I've never seen you
trash talk and appalling.

2832
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:33,741
And you know,

2833
01:14:33,741 --> 01:14:35,360
you're usually pretty easy going guy.

2834
01:14:35,361 --> 01:14:37,610
And when I've talked to
you about your opponent,

2835
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:40,640
you're pretty analytical
about their skillset,

2836
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,450
but,

2837
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:43,130
but there's something about Dominick Cruz,

2838
01:14:43,131 --> 01:14:44,150
it gets under your skin.

2839
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:46,150
But is it the,

2840
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:47,960
I don't know if you
know the history of us,

2841
01:14:47,961 --> 01:14:49,670
but I know you won the first fight.

2842
01:14:49,671 --> 01:14:50,620
We got caught him to gates.

2843
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:50,921
Well,

2844
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:51,250
when I,

2845
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:51,640
when I,

2846
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:56,640
when I first time I met him was after he
was just being an immature little punk.

2847
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,090
And this,

2848
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:58,331
I mean,

2849
01:14:58,331 --> 01:14:58,490
I,

2850
01:14:58,490 --> 01:14:59,323
I'm like,

2851
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:00,131
you know,

2852
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:01,750
open to be cool with whoever.

2853
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,960
I never met the guy,

2854
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:04,120
I don't know him from Adam.

2855
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:09,040
And he like kind of chose me as an enemy
and in the real world that guys in my

2856
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:09,874
town,

2857
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:10,803
we're going to do,

2858
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,730
we're going to do some sort of battle,

2859
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:13,211
you know,

2860
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:14,590
or he's not going to do that.

2861
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:15,371
You know?

2862
01:15:15,371 --> 01:15:17,710
And we did and it still didn't go away.

2863
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:18,311
You know,

2864
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:21,880
it's like the guy's got a chip on it so
I really believe he's jealous of me for

2865
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:23,620
some shape or form.

2866
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:27,460
And like I've sat there and talked to
them before and like he's like complain

2867
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:30,580
about stuff and he's gotten a lot better
cause I think his situation has gotten

2868
01:15:30,581 --> 01:15:31,360
a lot better.

2869
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,210
He's getting more notoriety and
more money and things like that,

2870
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,280
but I think he's jealous,

2871
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,091
you know?

2872
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:37,800
And it,

2873
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,800
it gets on my nerves.

2874
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:39,310
Like,

2875
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:39,521
dude,

2876
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:43,900
you got plenty of great stuff going on
in your life and he's got to choose me as

2877
01:15:43,901 --> 01:15:45,130
the person he's going
to be negative about.

2878
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:49,140
Is it that or is it just that that's
how he gets himself fired up to compete

2879
01:15:49,141 --> 01:15:49,741
against someone?

2880
01:15:49,741 --> 01:15:50,574
I don't care.

2881
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:51,420
You don't care.

2882
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:51,631
I mean,

2883
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:52,440
I don't care what his,

2884
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:55,710
what his money it is
to be a dickhead to me.

2885
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,410
You don't be a dickhead to me,

2886
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:58,890
period.

2887
01:15:58,890 --> 01:15:59,950
How was he being a dickhead?

2888
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:00,803
Like what did he do?

2889
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:01,121
Well,

2890
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:01,391
okay,

2891
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:01,960
so,

2892
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,800
so the first time we fought
we signed those posters,

2893
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:06,640
you know that story,

2894
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:08,200
where were you sign?

2895
01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:09,280
Everybody takes home,

2896
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:09,881
you know,

2897
01:16:09,881 --> 01:16:12,640
your certain amount of posters that you
put up in your gym and stuff like that.

2898
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:14,800
They give some to
charity important people.

2899
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:16,560
And he was pissed.

2900
01:16:16,561 --> 01:16:18,010
His face was on the poster.

2901
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:21,490
There's four title fights that night
and say put all the champions on there.

2902
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:26,410
And so he starts signing his name over
my face of the posters that everybody

2903
01:16:26,411 --> 01:16:27,244
takes home.

2904
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:31,570
And so like that started and
then after the fight I beat him.

2905
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,510
And then I've got friends in San Diego.

2906
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:34,870
I was,

2907
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:35,320
you know,

2908
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,900
helping promote a fight in San Diego.

2909
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:43,150
And all I hear is Dominic's running his
mouth and like talking crap about me.

2910
01:16:43,151 --> 01:16:44,260
I even thought about the guy,

2911
01:16:44,261 --> 01:16:44,850
you know,

2912
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,370
and he's got my poster
up in his jam and he's,

2913
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,190
you know,

2914
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:49,150
defacing it.

2915
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:51,460
And just like talk in chat and I'm like,

2916
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:52,840
what is this guy's problem?

2917
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:55,510
Like obsessing like he's got a
fucking hard on for me or something.

2918
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:56,180
You know,

2919
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:56,850
like,

2920
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:57,070
dude,

2921
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,530
I could give two shits about this guy,

2922
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,460
but you fought him again.

2923
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,730
And then we fought them in and
then I fought him again and uh,

2924
01:17:03,731 --> 01:17:05,920
I felt like I did more
damage in that fight.

2925
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,570
And you know,

2926
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,800
that the events prior to that fight kind
of let things set things to rest with

2927
01:17:13,191 --> 01:17:14,480
us because we had,

2928
01:17:14,481 --> 01:17:14,781
as it were,

2929
01:17:14,781 --> 01:17:18,620
forced to spend time together and this
whole camp Pendleton thing when we did

2930
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:19,700
this crucible and like,

2931
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:23,630
they're like tugging at her heartstrings
about the military and they put us

2932
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:25,400
through this crazy workout and like,

2933
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,330
you know,

2934
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:29,750
that's when I actually got to get to
know him a little bit better and realize

2935
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:30,380
like,

2936
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,190
all right,

2937
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:31,580
the guy,

2938
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:35,840
the guy's coming from a place where he
feels like he's been misrepresented,

2939
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:38,210
he's feels like he's underpaid,

2940
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:39,230
he's mismanaged,

2941
01:17:39,231 --> 01:17:40,130
he's this and that.

2942
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,840
And we actually had some good talks
and kind of put the the beef aside,

2943
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:46,430
but I feel like there's still
a little jealousy there.

2944
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:48,013
You know what I mean?

2945
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:50,330
Had some good talks and he's
still like to fuck him up.

2946
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:51,223
Oh yeah.

2947
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,790
And vice versa,

2948
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:54,110
you know?

2949
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,250
That's really interesting.

2950
01:17:55,310 --> 01:18:00,030
So that must be a very strange thing to
be spending so much time with a dude.

2951
01:18:00,031 --> 01:18:01,050
You're about to go to war war.

2952
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:01,950
It was weird in the,

2953
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,250
you know what happened in like
slipped through the cracks.

2954
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:09,640
It was like new PR people and the Marines
setting up this thing that was going

2955
01:18:10,751 --> 01:18:15,751
to be a a like a partnership with the
UFC and this and that and no one really

2956
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:20,840
understood the fact that he and I were
fighting in a month and a half and

2957
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:23,570
they're going to have us
working as a team together,

2958
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:26,180
like going through this crazy crucible.

2959
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,380
We did a third of the crucible,

2960
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:32,120
which is like the like the initiation
ceremony where they put these guys through

2961
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:35,420
hell for 50 hours and no
sleep and all this stuff.

2962
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,531
Phil Davis,

2963
01:18:36,531 --> 01:18:37,370
Rich Franklin,

2964
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,320
Dominic and myself had to go.

2965
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:39,651
They're like,

2966
01:18:39,651 --> 01:18:39,891
okay,

2967
01:18:39,891 --> 01:18:42,350
we're going to shoot these guns
with La and meeting these marines,

2968
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:43,184
whatever.

2969
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,151
The next thing you know,

2970
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:44,600
they're like,

2971
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,830
we're going to do this obstacle course,

2972
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:47,450
which is a small little obstacle course.

2973
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:50,180
Go to meet the drill
sergeants and they're like,

2974
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:51,463
you know,

2975
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:53,750
they were not cracking a
smile and this and that.

2976
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:55,520
They have to start doing this,

2977
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:56,413
this uh,

2978
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,660
this like short but intense,

2979
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:00,470
uh,

2980
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,101
whatever it's called,

2981
01:19:01,101 --> 01:19:01,970
obstacle course.

2982
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,260
Then they throw backpacks on us
and we start our day marching,

2983
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:07,940
whether yelling at us and all this stuff.

2984
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,080
Then it goes to the next thing,

2985
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:09,381
next thing,

2986
01:19:09,381 --> 01:19:09,921
next thing you know,

2987
01:19:09,921 --> 01:19:11,180
it's like 10 o'clock at night.

2988
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:15,170
We'd been there for like nine hours
just getting like punk by these,

2989
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:17,900
by these marines and like
crawling through dirt,

2990
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:19,970
carrying fucking ammunition stuff.

2991
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:21,043
Like,

2992
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:24,170
like Dominic heard is he ran and got,

2993
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:28,820
got hurt his knee tripping over
Bob Wire and he has his Christ.

2994
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:29,840
We're all jacked up.

2995
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:31,610
He had like his shoes didn't fit,

2996
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:35,780
so we had like huge blisters on his feet
and I ended up hurting myself a little

2997
01:19:35,781 --> 01:19:36,021
bit.

2998
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,460
I had a broken hand at the time.

2999
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,470
I didn't know I was to
be doing this stuff.

3000
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,600
I had a broken hand.

3001
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,990
It was like a week and a half old,

3002
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,220
just a little fracture.

3003
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,900
And I did,

3004
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,500
I climbed the top of the rope.

3005
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:46,301
I did the pullups,

3006
01:19:46,301 --> 01:19:50,180
they did all this stuff because I didn't
want to tell my opponent that I had a

3007
01:19:50,181 --> 01:19:50,930
broken hand.

3008
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:51,740
Oh my God.

3009
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,000
So it was like,

3010
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:53,231
man,

3011
01:19:53,231 --> 01:19:54,770
it was crazy.

3012
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:55,880
That's ridiculous.

3013
01:19:55,881 --> 01:19:56,780
What is terrible idea?

3014
01:19:56,781 --> 01:19:58,220
Who the fuck put that together?

3015
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,780
It was slipped through the cracks.

3016
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:02,450
All new workers that UFC and like Redo it.

3017
01:20:02,451 --> 01:20:05,390
By the time I got in the middle of it
and everybody got in the middle of it,

3018
01:20:05,391 --> 01:20:06,980
it was like the marines,

3019
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:08,970
they're like appreciate about America.

3020
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:09,804
And it was like,

3021
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,720
dude,

3022
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,100
you know.

3023
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:11,933
I was like,

3024
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:14,940
just like Phil was laughing and,

3025
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:15,211
and the,

3026
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:17,220
and the guys like Phil,

3027
01:20:17,221 --> 01:20:18,810
you will stop laughing right now.

3028
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:21,690
You will the blower blood in
like so he's trying not to laugh.

3029
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:22,920
And the other guy says,

3030
01:20:22,921 --> 01:20:23,754
uh,

3031
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,530
the other Joe Sergeant says,

3032
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:25,981
Phil,

3033
01:20:25,981 --> 01:20:26,581
when he says,

3034
01:20:26,581 --> 01:20:27,181
stop laughing,

3035
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:28,830
he means hide your teeth.

3036
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:30,840
And then I start fucking laughing.

3037
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,090
I'm like busting up laughing and,

3038
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:33,570
and then,

3039
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:34,530
and then so they're like,

3040
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,370
Zap,

3041
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:36,510
funny Mr Favor,

3042
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,570
you think there's funny something
funny about Americans dying in war.

3043
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:40,110
And then I'm like,

3044
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:40,680
all right,

3045
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,513
this is like,

3046
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:42,210
okay,

3047
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,350
this is right at the beginning.

3048
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,220
Wow,

3049
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,010
we're getting like this,

3050
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,340
this whole thing that's
a Moronica sentence.

3051
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,480
We had to do a,

3052
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:50,340
yeah,

3053
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:50,850
we had,

3054
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:51,810
we had to do something,

3055
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:52,230
uh,

3056
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:54,900
where we like we're doing
these problem solving things.

3057
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:55,860
We had to like communicate,

3058
01:20:55,861 --> 01:21:00,030
like one guy was the leader and we had
to like get these like big buckets past

3059
01:21:00,031 --> 01:21:03,750
the ropes and follow these rules and like
problem solve and like communicate as

3060
01:21:03,751 --> 01:21:04,584
a team.

3061
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:04,910
So I,

3062
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:05,701
by the end of the thing,

3063
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:07,500
it was like we were cool and then,

3064
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:08,450
you know,

3065
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:08,970
we were like,

3066
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:11,160
he's asking me advice about stuff and,

3067
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,090
and really,

3068
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:12,420
yeah,

3069
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,111
vice versa.

3070
01:21:13,111 --> 01:21:14,840
And then we'll get her
advice and give him,

3071
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:15,990
give him some shitty advice.

3072
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:17,270
He would just,

3073
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:17,760
I was,

3074
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,630
he was complaining about his
mismanagement and all this kind of stuff.

3075
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:21,900
And I was like,

3076
01:21:21,901 --> 01:21:22,734
dude,

3077
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,510
just say I went through the same stuff.

3078
01:21:24,511 --> 01:21:24,751
He's like,

3079
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:26,190
I've been fighting just as long as you,

3080
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:26,791
I was there.

3081
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:30,510
I met you when you fought
Charlie Valencia for the title.

3082
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,261
You remember meeting.

3083
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,540
I didn't remember meeting him or whatever.

3084
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,050
And it was like,

3085
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:34,650
he's like,

3086
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:35,180
I,

3087
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,350
I this and I that and just
feeling sorry for himself.

3088
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:37,561
I'm like,

3089
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:38,130
dude,

3090
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,720
stop feeling sorry for yourself.

3091
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:40,741
Do this.

3092
01:21:40,741 --> 01:21:41,071
And he's like,

3093
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:41,201
well,

3094
01:21:41,201 --> 01:21:42,360
am I on the right track?

3095
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:42,841
And I'm like,

3096
01:21:42,841 --> 01:21:43,051
yeah,

3097
01:21:43,051 --> 01:21:43,920
you're on the right track.

3098
01:21:43,921 --> 01:21:44,754
Do you just chill?

3099
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:45,953
And uh,

3100
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:46,951
and that was it.

3101
01:21:46,951 --> 01:21:49,500
And then we went our separate ways
and is back to being an enemies.

3102
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,020
What a strange thing that must've been
preparing for a title fight with a guy

3103
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,040
going through this.

3104
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,520
This is like a bonding experience that
you didn't want to have and some guy

3105
01:22:01,581 --> 01:22:02,271
yelling at you.

3106
01:22:02,271 --> 01:22:04,780
Do you think it's funny when
Americans are dying at war?

3107
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:05,360
It.

3108
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,040
Fuck it.

3109
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,591
Every time.

3110
01:22:06,591 --> 01:22:07,760
Every time you go to the funny,

3111
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:09,110
right now this is funny.

3112
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:10,630
This is funny.

3113
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:11,261
We're not needing,

3114
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:12,680
not preparing soldiers stupid,

3115
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:16,430
which trying to give you
the authentic experience.

3116
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,320
It must have been.

3117
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,350
It wasn't tense row.

3118
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,950
So it was intense.

3119
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:21,950
Do they crack a smile afterwards over?

3120
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:22,321
Yeah,

3121
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:24,030
we all went out and had a,

3122
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,070
had a good dinner and stuff like that.

3123
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:27,443
And uh,

3124
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:28,320
that was,

3125
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,990
that was the last Dominic
I hung out and good terms.

3126
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:31,870
Wow.

3127
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:33,010
Been enemies ever since.

3128
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:36,640
So this is before the rematch.

3129
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:37,660
This is before the rematch.

3130
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,760
How many times did you
drop him in that fight?

3131
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:44,920
I times where I hit him on the
Chin and he dropped three times.

3132
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:45,600
Three times.

3133
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,433
That should be,

3134
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:47,181
you know,

3135
01:22:47,181 --> 01:22:47,461
it's,

3136
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:47,721
it's,

3137
01:22:47,721 --> 01:22:48,554
she should be fat,

3138
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:49,200
right.

3139
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,033
Anything I hadn't,

3140
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:50,970
I had long hair.

3141
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:51,841
Next time I fight him,

3142
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:53,460
I'm not going to have my hair loose.

3143
01:22:53,461 --> 01:22:54,294
Cause every time,

3144
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:54,631
you know,

3145
01:22:54,631 --> 01:22:55,650
in sparring I,

3146
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:57,240
there's all times where you guys crazy,

3147
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,460
you slip and you move and stuff like that.

3148
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:00,870
But your hair goes for shakes.

3149
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,121
Judges.

3150
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:04,260
I mean these judges,

3151
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:05,350
I don't even want to get started on that.

3152
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,190
Don't even get started

3153
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,850
cause I'll go crazy to go get,

3154
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,471
get started.

3155
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:09,300
Does it drive you nuts?

3156
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,110
Oh my God.

3157
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:10,751
Disrespect.

3158
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:11,050
Right.

3159
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:12,010
It's total disrespect.

3160
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:15,850
I'm not going to start on it because I
see all these judges all the time and I

3161
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:18,200
don't want them angry bias against me.

3162
01:23:18,201 --> 01:23:18,640
Yeah,

3163
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,600
but like the comprehensive script.

3164
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:22,330
Some of these judges that,

3165
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:22,691
you know,

3166
01:23:22,691 --> 01:23:23,501
I've never wrestled,

3167
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:25,020
never did judo and Jujitsu,

3168
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:26,230
never done karate,

3169
01:23:26,231 --> 01:23:27,670
never done boxing.

3170
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,833
And it's like,

3171
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:32,800
why is my life in your hands and why?

3172
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:34,930
Because the athletic commission
doesn't want to change.

3173
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:35,531
What's what?

3174
01:23:35,531 --> 01:23:37,180
They feel like they already set in place.

3175
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:38,770
I have to admit they fucked up.

3176
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:41,100
They would have to admit
to these people are out.

3177
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:41,590
Yeah,

3178
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:42,250
they won't do it.

3179
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:42,880
I mean it's,

3180
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,840
it's mind boggling.

3181
01:23:43,841 --> 01:23:46,400
It's just a 50 50 chance they should,

3182
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:49,960
they should have to review
fights and have to explain.

3183
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:50,171
I mean,

3184
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:51,670
it's a big goddamn deal.

3185
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:52,161
You,

3186
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:53,710
you train for a,

3187
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:54,470
you know,

3188
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:58,210
eight weeks plus for a
fight after every fight.

3189
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,130
They should not have to only judge,

3190
01:24:00,131 --> 01:24:02,860
but explain what was going on.

3191
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:06,130
They explain why you thought
that this was better than that.

3192
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:10,060
I've been so tempted to grab one of
these judges that I know doesn't know

3193
01:24:10,061 --> 01:24:12,100
anything and ask them on camera.

3194
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,310
Ask them a full interview of like,

3195
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,260
what is an Omoplata?

3196
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,094
What makes it,

3197
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:19,300
what makes it work?

3198
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:20,260
What makes it not work?

3199
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,490
What is this?

3200
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:22,780
Is this a dangerous position?

3201
01:24:22,781 --> 01:24:23,800
When does it become dangerous?

3202
01:24:23,801 --> 01:24:24,634
When is it not?

3203
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:27,070
And you just like see where they're at.

3204
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:27,910
Dude,

3205
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:28,730
I see credit,

3206
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:29,770
I don't want to say any names,

3207
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:34,650
but one of the guys who's that judges
told me that a woman judge asked him what

3208
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:35,050
is,

3209
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,160
what is this guy doing?

3210
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,970
Like I was attempting
and Kamora she's like,

3211
01:24:37,971 --> 01:24:38,804
what is he doing?

3212
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:43,150
She had to ask what a guy's doing and
on top of that she doesn't know what it

3213
01:24:43,151 --> 01:24:43,601
felt like.

3214
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:45,610
Whether it's going to hurt the
guy or whether it's just a or,

3215
01:24:45,611 --> 01:24:45,731
well,

3216
01:24:45,731 --> 01:24:45,971
yeah,

3217
01:24:45,971 --> 01:24:47,680
like you know when someone has a,

3218
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:50,050
they got an Americana and it's
all up here and you're like,

3219
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:50,950
you think he's going to be okay.

3220
01:24:50,951 --> 01:24:53,800
He's going to just kind of twisting his
arm and then the guy who holds it to the

3221
01:24:53,801 --> 01:24:55,990
body and you've got to
know that that's better.

3222
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,700
Then once you get it to the body that's,

3223
01:24:57,701 --> 01:24:59,500
that's like a near submission.

3224
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:04,380
There's so many guys out there that could
really use those jobs that really know

3225
01:25:04,381 --> 01:25:06,520
what Charlie Valencia,

3226
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,241
for example,

3227
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:10,060
my good buddy who's an
accomplished fighter,

3228
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,470
been fighting for years,

3229
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:12,610
knows the sport inside and out.

3230
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:13,990
If he was a veteran,

3231
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,220
yeah.

3232
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,580
If it was a lucrative job,

3233
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,210
yeah,

3234
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,140
it should be to what it,

3235
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:18,490
what a great judge he would be.

3236
01:25:18,491 --> 01:25:18,820
You know?

3237
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:19,330
Absolutely.

3238
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:19,920
Everything knows.

3239
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,100
It feels like to get punched,

3240
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:23,010
know whether you get hit
on the top of the header.

3241
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,040
If you get hit on the chin,

3242
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,380
you know Ricardo,

3243
01:25:25,381 --> 01:25:26,410
Amanda's doing that now.

3244
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:26,891
That's great.

3245
01:25:26,891 --> 01:25:28,480
That's what they do is
absolutely fighters.

3246
01:25:28,481 --> 01:25:33,481
I agree with you 100% it's just there's
people that they might be able to never

3247
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:35,230
have boxed and judge boxing,

3248
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:36,011
you know,

3249
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:39,010
but you have to study boxing and you
have to talk to experts and stuff.

3250
01:25:39,011 --> 01:25:42,850
But I don't think it's possible for you
to know what the fuck is happening in a

3251
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:45,490
cage fight unless you have
some martial arts experience.

3252
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,630
I know a lot of,

3253
01:25:46,631 --> 01:25:47,590
a lot of grappling,

3254
01:25:47,591 --> 01:25:48,430
mixed martial arts,

3255
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:49,390
mixed martial arts,

3256
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:50,710
a lot of grappling that,

3257
01:25:50,711 --> 01:25:51,370
what does that say?

3258
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:52,120
It's five.

3259
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:52,953
I can't read that.

3260
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:53,853
Shirts.

3261
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:55,230
Brian's hold little bit side.

3262
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,040
It looks like fucking Hieroglyphs Joe,

3263
01:25:57,041 --> 01:25:59,740
do you ever watch the king of the cage
and glad you're challenged stuff now or

3264
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:00,191
is it just,

3265
01:26:00,191 --> 01:26:01,024
it's not even,

3266
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,250
it's not what it used be back

3267
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,083
when I was starting,

3268
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:07,130
when I was in gladder
challenging king of the case.

3269
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:08,810
That was the only other show in town,

3270
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,621
right?

3271
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:12,410
It was like the UFC and then them
and then whatever's in Japan.

3272
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,560
I still watch a small fights though,

3273
01:26:14,561 --> 01:26:15,140
are still watching.

3274
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:18,000
Hd Net has a lot of small
organizations that uh,

3275
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:18,461
come on.

3276
01:26:18,461 --> 01:26:19,030
They have,

3277
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:19,211
you know,

3278
01:26:19,211 --> 01:26:21,000
you get to see like a rich Clemente.

3279
01:26:21,001 --> 01:26:24,010
I just saw him fight and I
just saw Dave branch and uh,

3280
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:26,220
Anthony Johnson there a fucking dude.

3281
01:26:26,221 --> 01:26:27,250
He's got to weight cutting issue.

3282
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:28,360
Wow.

3283
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,360
I've never seen anybody up a weight class
and they keep missing this Guy Anthony

3284
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:36,040
Rumble Johnson says
incredibly talented guy.

3285
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:41,310
Weighs about two 30 ish before he
begins his cut down to one 70 shit.

3286
01:26:45,790 --> 01:26:47,690
I saw him walk through
the hallway once in a,

3287
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:49,120
I'm in a hotel,

3288
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:49,661
we're all,

3289
01:26:49,661 --> 01:26:50,650
I think it was in Denver.

3290
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,720
He was so god damn big.

3291
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:53,540
He wasn't fighting.

3292
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:54,373
You know,

3293
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:56,400
I couldn't believe how big he was.

3294
01:26:56,401 --> 01:26:56,741
I was like,

3295
01:26:56,741 --> 01:26:58,060
that dude is like a heavyweight.

3296
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,100
It's amazing that he can make one 70

3297
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,130
it's crazy.

3298
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:01,963
Well I,

3299
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:04,160
the reason I asked is I remember,

3300
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:08,960
cause it's cool that you do watch his
fights because I don't remember before I

3301
01:27:08,961 --> 01:27:10,760
was in the WC or the UFC,

3302
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:13,740
I remember you saying something
in recognizing me and,

3303
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,111
and,

3304
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:15,320
and like being like,

3305
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:15,561
Hey,

3306
01:27:15,561 --> 01:27:17,120
I've seen you fight and this and that.

3307
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:19,010
Which I thought was the coolest
thing in the world because,

3308
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:19,330
you know,

3309
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:19,970
it was like,

3310
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:20,271
man,

3311
01:27:20,271 --> 01:27:21,140
these guys are watching.

3312
01:27:21,141 --> 01:27:21,800
You know?

3313
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:26,660
And it's funny cause I was at a UFC in
Sacramento and I had a fake pass made

3314
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:27,411
from my buddy Vinny,

3315
01:27:27,411 --> 01:27:29,570
the hook think pass all the time.

3316
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,160
It was the best thing ever.

3317
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,420
It was in sac and I,

3318
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:33,254
uh,

3319
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:37,740
I had gotten in with the pass and
then I just beeline straight through,

3320
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,380
act like I own the
place and I'm in on the,

3321
01:27:39,381 --> 01:27:41,000
in the circle with Dana,

3322
01:27:41,001 --> 01:27:41,331
right,

3323
01:27:41,331 --> 01:27:43,100
with Dana and Lorenzo and all you guys.

3324
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:43,671
And Dana's like,

3325
01:27:43,671 --> 01:27:43,851
hey,

3326
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:45,380
how are you having a good time kid?

3327
01:27:45,381 --> 01:27:45,651
I'm like,

3328
01:27:45,651 --> 01:27:45,861
yeah,

3329
01:27:45,861 --> 01:27:46,581
having a good time,

3330
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:46,861
you know,

3331
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:50,060
and just chill out on the Internet
in a little circle with my fake pass.

3332
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:50,241
Oh,

3333
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:50,871
that's awesome.

3334
01:27:50,871 --> 01:27:51,650
And it was awesome.

3335
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:52,040
And then,

3336
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:52,570
uh,

3337
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:57,530
like because I was just at a point where
I was making a name for myself and the

3338
01:27:57,531 --> 01:27:57,870
low,

3339
01:27:57,870 --> 01:27:59,720
the smaller shows that,

3340
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,350
you know,

3341
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:02,030
made a little bit of
sense that I was there,

3342
01:28:02,031 --> 01:28:02,864
you know what I mean?

3343
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:04,670
So people didn't really
question it too much.

3344
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:05,600
Like you had,

3345
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:09,290
you had watched this a couple when I
was on little paper views and stuff,

3346
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:10,041
but yeah,

3347
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:11,090
that was the first time I think.

3348
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:11,321
Yeah,

3349
01:28:11,321 --> 01:28:12,580
I'd seen you in the king of the cage.

3350
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:13,271
I saw you.

3351
01:28:13,271 --> 01:28:16,550
I think I saw you live once
and I saw you on TV or on.

3352
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:20,110
That was back when my friend bud own the
king owned a piece of the candy case.

3353
01:28:20,111 --> 01:28:22,990
So you guys had tapes laying
around so I saw most of them.

3354
01:28:22,991 --> 01:28:24,600
Eddie was doing commentary back then too.

3355
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:25,270
Yeah,

3356
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:25,780
that's right.

3357
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:26,450
Yeah.

3358
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:27,230
That's funny though.

3359
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:28,063
Dana was like,

3360
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:29,340
yeah,

3361
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:29,800
no,

3362
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:30,321
no idea.

3363
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:31,630
I was just walking
around and they're like,

3364
01:28:31,631 --> 01:28:32,630
I own the joint days.

3365
01:28:32,631 --> 01:28:33,660
Like you having a good time kid.

3366
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:33,951
I'm like,

3367
01:28:33,951 --> 01:28:34,750
yes.

3368
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:35,583
Yeah,

3369
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:36,400
maybe.

3370
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:36,730
Yo,

3371
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:37,420
you were right.

3372
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:38,350
You did belong there.

3373
01:28:38,351 --> 01:28:41,770
Look now here we are promoting
a fucking huge fight.

3374
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:42,623
Belonged there.

3375
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:43,900
Of course you did.

3376
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,733
Absolutely.

3377
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:45,590
Now what,

3378
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:46,880
what is the date of your,

3379
01:28:46,881 --> 01:28:46,951
uh,

3380
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:47,860
your fight with brow?

3381
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:49,450
It's a July 7th.

3382
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:50,284
July 7th.

3383
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:54,280
It's the same card is a Anderson
Silva Chelsea on a rematch.

3384
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,660
That's going to be a crazy card.

3385
01:28:55,661 --> 01:28:55,800
Yeah.

3386
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:55,951
Yeah.

3387
01:28:55,951 --> 01:28:56,840
It's going to be there.

3388
01:28:56,850 --> 01:28:58,140
They've been moved to our card,

3389
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,153
which is awesome.

3390
01:28:59,400 --> 01:28:59,560
Yeah.

3391
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,070
He's going to make it one of
the biggest in UFC history.

3392
01:29:02,071 --> 01:29:03,750
A huge card which goes into,

3393
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:05,460
those are two monster fire's right there.

3394
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:06,481
How did the,

3395
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:07,290
uh,

3396
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:08,940
how did the Jon Jones,

3397
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:09,751
Rashad Evans fight?

3398
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:10,100
Dude,

3399
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:10,933
you're pretty good on paper.

3400
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:12,460
I think it did really well.

3401
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:14,170
I think they were surprised
at how well it did.

3402
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:16,020
I think it exceeded expectations.

3403
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,320
I think be Jon Jones is,

3404
01:29:17,321 --> 01:29:17,591
you know,

3405
01:29:17,591 --> 01:29:19,990
obviously on his way to
becoming a huge superstar.

3406
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:21,401
That's a,

3407
01:29:21,401 --> 01:29:23,650
that's a rare gem of a talent right there.

3408
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:27,730
And that you see a guy who's been
training for four years in MMA and he's,

3409
01:29:27,731 --> 01:29:28,030
you know,

3410
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:31,210
choking Leo Machida
unconscious like God damn.

3411
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:31,911
But you know,

3412
01:29:31,911 --> 01:29:33,710
his wrestling pedigree was really good.

3413
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:37,700
He was supposed to go with a
scholarship to Iowa and you know,

3414
01:29:37,701 --> 01:29:38,450
because he's,

3415
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:40,610
and he started his family instead.

3416
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:41,810
And uh,

3417
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:42,631
but he,

3418
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:42,850
he,

3419
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:45,890
he could have been a great rest or
collegiate wrestler at a high level also.

3420
01:29:45,891 --> 01:29:46,190
So,

3421
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:46,641
no doubt.

3422
01:29:46,641 --> 01:29:49,670
But what's impressing me is how
God damn good at striking is.

3423
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:51,080
And how good God,

3424
01:29:51,081 --> 01:29:51,891
how quick it got.

3425
01:29:51,891 --> 01:29:52,460
Good.

3426
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,570
I mean it was great.

3427
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:56,900
It was great when he fought Stephan
Bonner and he would fuck goose smile.

3428
01:29:56,901 --> 01:29:57,440
He was,

3429
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:57,710
you know,

3430
01:29:57,710 --> 01:29:59,600
his striking look good it but it,

3431
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:01,310
but it's become insane.

3432
01:30:01,311 --> 01:30:01,581
You know,

3433
01:30:01,581 --> 01:30:06,230
he out strikes shogun out
strikes rampage and you know,

3434
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,660
it makes it look easy and that height
and reach is so hard to fuck with men.

3435
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:11,000
Yeah.

3436
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,000
It's crazy man to have you talked to
him since his situation he's Dui and for

3437
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:17,690
those who don't know,

3438
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:19,160
crashed into a pole apparently.

3439
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:19,721
Yeah,

3440
01:30:19,721 --> 01:30:20,380
he's,

3441
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:21,310
he uh,

3442
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:22,780
he's been hard to get ahold of.

3443
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:23,733
Like,

3444
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:24,940
you know,

3445
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,050
he's is a,

3446
01:30:26,051 --> 01:30:28,720
he's like changes his number all
the time and stuff like that.

3447
01:30:28,721 --> 01:30:30,160
I really talked to him in a long time,

3448
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:31,570
not since I've seen him in person,

3449
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:32,740
but yeah,

3450
01:30:32,741 --> 01:30:33,320
it's suck him.

3451
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,330
He's a young guy.

3452
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:38,620
I W I did an interview and they read
me this thing that he said like a week

3453
01:30:38,621 --> 01:30:40,700
before and uh,

3454
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:43,890
yeah,

3455
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:45,290
which is crazy and it makes me seem,

3456
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:48,220
almost makes me feel like he
did it on purpose just to like,

3457
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,080
like add to the story.

3458
01:30:50,081 --> 01:30:50,914
It's like,

3459
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:51,940
why would you be like,

3460
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:52,391
dude,

3461
01:30:52,391 --> 01:30:53,170
I will,

3462
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:57,270
I'm so happy to do this because I will
never get a Dui then like a week later,

3463
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:57,610
get it

3464
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:58,340
Dui.

3465
01:30:58,340 --> 01:30:59,173
That's crazy.

3466
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,380
I think it's pressure,

3467
01:31:02,381 --> 01:31:02,681
man.

3468
01:31:02,681 --> 01:31:03,161
I think,

3469
01:31:03,161 --> 01:31:03,401
uh,

3470
01:31:03,401 --> 01:31:04,510
especially if you're,

3471
01:31:04,511 --> 01:31:04,811
you know,

3472
01:31:04,811 --> 01:31:06,400
you're a young guy and you don't,

3473
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:06,851
you know,

3474
01:31:06,851 --> 01:31:11,830
he's incredibly talented and the success
must be overwhelming to a few years ago

3475
01:31:11,831 --> 01:31:14,470
have gone from having to be a
bouncer to take care of your,

3476
01:31:14,471 --> 01:31:16,240
your girlfriend and your new baby,

3477
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:16,691
you know,

3478
01:31:16,691 --> 01:31:17,920
and you're really worried
about your future.

3479
01:31:17,921 --> 01:31:21,880
So you decided to start fighting from
that just a few years ago to drive in a

3480
01:31:21,881 --> 01:31:23,950
Bentley top of the fucking world.

3481
01:31:23,951 --> 01:31:27,730
Everybody wants to shake your hand and
the world is stepping forward to John.

3482
01:31:27,731 --> 01:31:29,710
John's a shake his hand and he's see him,

3483
01:31:29,711 --> 01:31:31,030
he's got a glow around them.

3484
01:31:31,031 --> 01:31:31,690
An Aura.

3485
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:34,600
That's a hard the
management and it's hard.

3486
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:36,583
Yeah.

3487
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,420
Was it hard for you?

3488
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:39,950
You know,

3489
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:42,660
it's not hard for me because I
surround myself with the same people.

3490
01:31:42,661 --> 01:31:43,230
Like,

3491
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:43,650
you know,

3492
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:46,830
my dad lives right next door
to me and all my buddies.

3493
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,930
I mean I like my team of guys.

3494
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:50,070
We started together,

3495
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:50,311
you know,

3496
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:55,200
Joseph was mopping the mats that are at
our gym and an amateur when he started.

3497
01:31:55,201 --> 01:31:55,951
And Chad Mendez,

3498
01:31:55,951 --> 01:31:58,590
I recruited out of college and
Tj recruited out of college.

3499
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:00,790
Me and Danny Castillo
were high school buddies.

3500
01:32:00,791 --> 01:32:01,960
And um,

3501
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:03,490
I have the same people around me

3502
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:04,493
and you guys all have,

3503
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:07,560
you have like a couple of houses and
y'all live close to each other too.

3504
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:07,931
Yeah.

3505
01:32:07,931 --> 01:32:08,680
Or the overtime.

3506
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,290
It's starting to change now because
guys are getting older and getting more

3507
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,990
money and getting married and
getting all sorts of stuff.

3508
01:32:13,991 --> 01:32:16,540
But we've had like a
little commune that was,

3509
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:17,240
uh,

3510
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:17,990
it was really cool.

3511
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:19,180
We call it the block and,

3512
01:32:19,181 --> 01:32:20,014
and uh,

3513
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:21,250
it's a tight knit group.

3514
01:32:21,251 --> 01:32:21,371
You know,

3515
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:22,090
we have our,

3516
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:23,320
we have a charity golf tournament.

3517
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:24,490
We're having a charity golf tournament.

3518
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:25,780
It's the second annual we have,

3519
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:26,560
uh,

3520
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,090
that's a week after my fight.

3521
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:31,990
We have a end of the year banquet
where we give out awards and like give

3522
01:32:31,991 --> 01:32:33,160
speeches to everybody,

3523
01:32:33,161 --> 01:32:36,730
to two guys and like real favorites
and everybody gets dressed up.

3524
01:32:36,731 --> 01:32:37,520
We have a big dinner.

3525
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,460
So it's a whole gym.

3526
01:32:38,461 --> 01:32:39,360
Everybody trains there.

3527
01:32:39,361 --> 01:32:39,780
Is that what it is?

3528
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:40,591
It's the whole team.

3529
01:32:40,591 --> 01:32:43,920
And then whoever wants to buy a dinner
to come and be a part of it and,

3530
01:32:43,921 --> 01:32:44,340
and uh,

3531
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:45,870
we acknowledge everybody who does their,

3532
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:46,460
their,

3533
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:47,530
their little parts and,

3534
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:49,500
and we have like houseboat trip.

3535
01:32:49,501 --> 01:32:52,110
So I mean it's like a
real tight knit crew.

3536
01:32:52,111 --> 01:32:53,010
So I mean,

3537
01:32:53,011 --> 01:32:57,420
it's hard also when you got a guy
like Tj Dillashaw for example,

3538
01:32:57,421 --> 01:33:01,140
who just started training like two and a
half years ago and I have a bad day and

3539
01:33:01,141 --> 01:33:02,250
he's kicking the crap out of me.

3540
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:02,491
You know,

3541
01:33:02,491 --> 01:33:04,440
it's like hard to get on a high horse,

3542
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:05,363
you know,

3543
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,360
it's like,

3544
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,460
how did you start this
whole commune thing?

3545
01:33:08,461 --> 01:33:08,851
How did you,

3546
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:09,810
this the block,

3547
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,411
how did you,

3548
01:33:10,411 --> 01:33:10,980
uh,

3549
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:11,610
I thought was,

3550
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:13,980
I saw once in one of the countdown shows.

3551
01:33:13,981 --> 01:33:15,780
I was like that it's fucking cool.

3552
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,160
What a smart thing.

3553
01:33:17,161 --> 01:33:20,030
Like surround yourself with a bunch of
cool guys when you train with y'all live

3554
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:20,660
together,

3555
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,021
right?

3556
01:33:21,021 --> 01:33:21,411
It was,

3557
01:33:21,411 --> 01:33:22,460
it was basically,

3558
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:25,220
so I talked about when I
first graduated college,

3559
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:29,530
I started a little business top
line coaching for kids and it,

3560
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:30,680
my coach at the time,

3561
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:35,710
Lenny's Leschi allowed me to run
a summer of summer camps for the,

3562
01:33:37,281 --> 01:33:37,730
uh,

3563
01:33:37,730 --> 01:33:40,100
for the college through my business.

3564
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:45,250
And that gave me like $40,000 that went
in and out and I got to keep like 3007

3565
01:33:45,561 --> 01:33:46,430
or something like that.

3566
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:51,230
But then I that established them some
credit in the history work history and I

3567
01:33:51,231 --> 01:33:55,220
ended up buying my first house when
I was making on paper $7,000 a year.

3568
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:55,790
Colin,

3569
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:57,050
he can buy a house shit.

3570
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:57,221
So,

3571
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:57,381
you know,

3572
01:33:57,381 --> 01:33:58,161
but I was hustling.

3573
01:33:58,161 --> 01:33:58,331
I mean,

3574
01:33:58,331 --> 01:34:01,850
I was always able to make money and I
filled it with all my buddies to help pay

3575
01:34:01,851 --> 01:34:02,684
the rent.

3576
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:03,320
And,

3577
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:04,100
uh,

3578
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,330
then my buddy Tommy,

3579
01:34:05,331 --> 01:34:05,841
who's back there,

3580
01:34:05,841 --> 01:34:06,950
he works for me full time.

3581
01:34:06,951 --> 01:34:08,660
We knew each other in
high school and college.

3582
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:14,050
He was just graduating and was out of
a job or he wanted to buy a house house

3583
01:34:14,931 --> 01:34:17,660
opened up next door and my
other buddy bought that one.

3584
01:34:17,661 --> 01:34:20,000
And then I started doing better
about the house next door to that.

3585
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:21,170
My other buddy,

3586
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:21,560
uh,

3587
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:26,240
Sanchez who started out as
like my nemesis in college,

3588
01:34:26,241 --> 01:34:28,190
like we were enemies like two and two.

3589
01:34:28,191 --> 01:34:28,791
My senior year,

3590
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:31,520
he's like put me out of
my senior year in college.

3591
01:34:31,521 --> 01:34:35,210
Like only got to make me
cry and competition cause
it was like the end of my

3592
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:36,044
college career,

3593
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:39,920
he ends up coming and taking my spot at
Uc Davis and living with me renting a

3594
01:34:39,921 --> 01:34:40,340
room.

3595
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:40,881
Wow.

3596
01:34:40,881 --> 01:34:44,750
And then he starts managing my gym and
then we bought another house right there

3597
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:45,381
together.

3598
01:34:45,381 --> 01:34:46,220
I put the down payment,

3599
01:34:46,221 --> 01:34:49,310
he makes the payments and he
started a little business in there.

3600
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:50,450
This is all my book.

3601
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:51,770
You're going to love my book by the way.

3602
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:52,060
It's,

3603
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,160
it's money lost.

3604
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:54,231
But,

3605
01:34:54,231 --> 01:34:55,064
uh,

3606
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:55,920
so

3607
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,380
he starts the name of it for everybody.

3608
01:34:57,610 --> 01:34:58,370
The business,

3609
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:59,450
the book of the books,

3610
01:34:59,451 --> 01:35:00,320
laws of the ring,

3611
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:02,090
your I laws and the laws of the ring.

3612
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:02,541
Yeah.

3613
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:03,320
And it's all these,

3614
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:06,390
it's all these theories about
community and personal credit and,

3615
01:35:06,391 --> 01:35:07,480
and positive attitude.

3616
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,950
That's the motivational book really.

3617
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:10,550
Yeah.

3618
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:10,941
Awesome.

3619
01:35:10,941 --> 01:35:11,930
So it's not just a,

3620
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,100
this is how I,

3621
01:35:13,101 --> 01:35:13,580
you know,

3622
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:14,720
became successful.

3623
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:16,070
There it is right there.

3624
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:17,623
And uh,

3625
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,470
so,

3626
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:19,580
so Sanchez starts,

3627
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:23,390
this starts this company
in one of our garages,

3628
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:28,910
like maintaining bank owned property
lawns and next thing you know,

3629
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:32,150
he's the largest company in
the u s right now for that.

3630
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,820
He's just caked out.

3631
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:36,090
So cat,

3632
01:35:36,090 --> 01:35:38,260
he just becomes like
a crazy lawnmower guy.

3633
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:38,640
He's,

3634
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:42,490
he's mowing lawns from
Hawaii to Iowa to really,

3635
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:43,460
he did,

3636
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:48,460
they do like 33,000 or
35,000 some stupid number.

3637
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:51,630
And that's all on the block.

3638
01:35:51,631 --> 01:35:53,820
And we've had all sorts of
stuff that's come off the block.

3639
01:35:53,821 --> 01:35:55,400
Chad Mendez lives on the block.

3640
01:35:55,410 --> 01:35:56,520
Tj Dillashaw.

3641
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,230
We've had like 30 guys,

3642
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:00,540
Korean Zombie came and stayed out there.

3643
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:01,920
How many houses is it?

3644
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:04,110
It's four houses right next to each other.

3645
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:08,610
And then there's one house that's my
college buddy that's about a block and a

3646
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:08,980
half.

3647
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:12,070
That's so bad ass to have so many people
around you that you can count on all

3648
01:36:12,071 --> 01:36:12,870
the time too.

3649
01:36:12,870 --> 01:36:13,703
You know,

3650
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:14,711
he trained with,

3651
01:36:14,711 --> 01:36:15,281
you know him,

3652
01:36:15,281 --> 01:36:16,140
he can count on them.

3653
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:16,450
Yeah,

3654
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:17,210
it's awesome.

3655
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:18,800
It's cost me some money over the years,

3656
01:36:18,801 --> 01:36:21,220
like being the bank for
these guys now you know,

3657
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:23,090
guys aren't always a pay
rent and stuff like that,

3658
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:26,180
but I mean it built something
today that's super solid.

3659
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:30,200
I mean our team now is one of
the top in the world and uh,

3660
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:30,651
you know,

3661
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:34,310
it was all part of that carpooling
to the gym and you know,

3662
01:36:34,311 --> 01:36:35,030
if you need to go,

3663
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,820
you have no food,

3664
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:36,920
go to one of the houses and

3665
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:38,870
take somebody else's.

3666
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,220
I mean man,

3667
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:43,400
as long as everybody is
actually contributing.

3668
01:36:43,401 --> 01:36:43,671
Right.

3669
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:46,040
And everybody has a place in
a function and a part of it.

3670
01:36:46,110 --> 01:36:46,850
Yeah.

3671
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:47,480
Now you,

3672
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,590
you have a gym,

3673
01:36:48,591 --> 01:36:50,540
you have your own gym
set up and what does,

3674
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:52,460
what does your gym called
its ultimate fitness,

3675
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:53,353
ultimate fitness.

3676
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:56,390
And regular people can go
and train there as well.

3677
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,010
It's like you have classes and shit.

3678
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:58,903
Yeah we have like

3679
01:36:58,920 --> 01:36:59,753
uh,

3680
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:00,450
we have,

3681
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:01,283
you know,

3682
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:02,213
quite a few,

3683
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:04,530
quite a few members,

3684
01:37:04,531 --> 01:37:07,770
like 400 something members and
it's been around five years now.

3685
01:37:07,771 --> 01:37:08,460
We've,

3686
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:09,293
we've,

3687
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,050
you know,

3688
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:10,501
grown it.

3689
01:37:10,501 --> 01:37:10,660
It's,

3690
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:11,790
it's got a great reputation.

3691
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:12,420
It's pretty bad.

3692
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:13,170
Do you,

3693
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:15,270
are you the one who's managing everything?

3694
01:37:15,271 --> 01:37:19,190
Like do you make your own
training scheduled that you
put everything together?

3695
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,590
Do you have like an MMA coach who
handles like when you're going to do more

3696
01:37:22,591 --> 01:37:22,950
anti,

3697
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:23,880
when you're going to wrestle,

3698
01:37:23,881 --> 01:37:25,050
when you're going to combine them,

3699
01:37:25,051 --> 01:37:26,700
do you have someone who analyzes you?

3700
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:27,880
We have like a,

3701
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:30,850
we have a team schedule and then
I have my individual coaches.

3702
01:37:30,851 --> 01:37:32,800
Like I have a Jujitsu coach,

3703
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:35,010
have a master tongs,

3704
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:36,070
my standup coach and,

3705
01:37:36,071 --> 01:37:39,190
and we have set times with our team where
we ever team practices that are pretty

3706
01:37:39,191 --> 01:37:40,024
structured.

3707
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:43,060
And then we have our individual
stuff that we do outside of it.

3708
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:44,440
So I'll do,

3709
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:44,950
you know,

3710
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:45,880
the set practices,

3711
01:37:45,881 --> 01:37:49,270
which are the pro practices
three days a week in the morning.

3712
01:37:49,271 --> 01:37:53,170
And then two days of sparring and then
we have two days of Jujitsu and then

3713
01:37:53,171 --> 01:37:56,020
everything else is of mix and

3714
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:56,341
match.

3715
01:37:56,341 --> 01:37:58,740
We have a ricin class for guys
that need to do more wrestling.

3716
01:37:58,741 --> 01:38:01,380
But you don't have a person
who sets it all up for you.

3717
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:02,760
You do it all for yourself.

3718
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:04,680
How much you,

3719
01:38:04,681 --> 01:38:05,070
um,

3720
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:08,640
you set your own strength and conditioning
schedule or did you bring in a guy

3721
01:38:08,641 --> 01:38:09,030
for that?

3722
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,630
I've got a guy,

3723
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:11,730
well I've got an individual
coaches for everything.

3724
01:38:11,731 --> 01:38:13,500
I've got a Russell Dunning's,

3725
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:14,970
my strength and conditioning guy.

3726
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,350
He's my physical therapist.

3727
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:17,520
And the how do you decide,

3728
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:18,780
like when you go to him,

3729
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:19,880
when you do Moitai,

3730
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,870
how do you do it by your body?

3731
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:24,480
Do you do it by what you
know from your experience?

3732
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:28,350
I said a general schedule and then
listen to my body outside of that.

3733
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,720
So if I feel like I
need to do more or less,

3734
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:31,830
I'll do more or less.

3735
01:38:31,831 --> 01:38:32,880
But um,

3736
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:36,570
like said it a general schedule that
I know is always going to be there.

3737
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,310
And then if I need to take a day off,

3738
01:38:38,311 --> 01:38:40,560
I'll just let someone know
or if I need to do more,

3739
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:44,970
I'll just call someone up and we all
kind of do that same thing at the team.

3740
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:45,601
You know?

3741
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:46,434
It's like,

3742
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:47,160
uh,

3743
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:51,060
we have all these different things
available and you can hit them all.

3744
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:51,540
That's what,

3745
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:54,810
that's what makes our team really
unique is we're training all year round.

3746
01:38:54,811 --> 01:38:56,820
If you don't have a
fight and you're in town,

3747
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:58,980
like you just go to practice,

3748
01:38:59,100 --> 01:38:59,660
you know it's,

3749
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:00,493
it's what you do.

3750
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:01,320
Everybody trains.

3751
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,330
Nobody takes time off
and gets fat and stupid,

3752
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:03,721
but you can't.

3753
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:03,990
Yeah.

3754
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:04,670
You can't anymore.

3755
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:05,503
I can't chat.

3756
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:07,130
Everyone has to be improving too.

3757
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:07,860
Right?

3758
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:08,101
Yeah.

3759
01:39:08,101 --> 01:39:09,630
This is the biggest gains like that.

3760
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:13,590
Isn't that incredible for you to watch
when you started fighting to today and

3761
01:39:13,591 --> 01:39:16,620
see how crazy the sport has become me?

3762
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:18,030
I remember when I used to watch,

3763
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:18,810
you know,

3764
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:21,870
when I saw your fights and king
of the cage or back in that day,

3765
01:39:21,871 --> 01:39:24,300
nobody knew what the
fuck cage fighting was.

3766
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:24,631
No,

3767
01:39:24,631 --> 01:39:25,200
it was crazy.

3768
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,400
I was like embarrassed.

3769
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:28,780
It wasn't like you could pick up chicks,

3770
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:29,371
at least the chicks.

3771
01:39:29,371 --> 01:39:29,671
I like.

3772
01:39:29,671 --> 01:39:30,990
You can pick up chicks by Tom.

3773
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,833
You're a cage fighter.

3774
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:33,310
How they were thinking
about a piece of shit.

3775
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,150
Human dog keep that on the DL,

3776
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:37,063
you know,

3777
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:40,680
they get to know you
better now it's like chic.

3778
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:45,510
I saw this video with Charlise thrawn
and she was talking about how much she

3779
01:39:45,511 --> 01:39:46,740
loves the UFC and I was like,

3780
01:39:46,741 --> 01:39:49,860
how fucking tweet did you tweet that?

3781
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:50,221
No,

3782
01:39:50,221 --> 01:39:50,461
no,

3783
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:50,790
no,

3784
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:51,001
no.

3785
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:52,050
It's on the underground.

3786
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,300
It was a mighty,

3787
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,510
well a lot of people tweeted,

3788
01:39:54,511 --> 01:39:59,130
I think because the video was her on the
Conan O'brien show and she was talking

3789
01:39:59,131 --> 01:40:03,180
about how much she loves watching filing
and he could see Colin like he's a

3790
01:40:03,181 --> 01:40:04,410
little bit uncomfortable with it.

3791
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:05,190
You know,

3792
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:09,270
cause like when chicks start talking
about like fucking savage men beating the

3793
01:40:09,271 --> 01:40:10,460
fuck a guy like Conan,

3794
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:10,881
like on,

3795
01:40:10,881 --> 01:40:11,610
uh Huh.

3796
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:12,443
Yeah,

3797
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,610
he doesn't even want to know that exists.

3798
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,360
He certainly doesn't want them to
be coming out of the mouth of the,

3799
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,030
one of the most beautiful
women in the world.

3800
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:22,100
What he's trying to impress her.

3801
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:22,310
Hey,

3802
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:23,550
that's mother nature though.

3803
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,080
It's a bench goes back to,

3804
01:40:25,081 --> 01:40:25,770
uh,

3805
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,000
to the old instincts,

3806
01:40:27,001 --> 01:40:27,630
the wounded,

3807
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:28,710
the wounded antelope,

3808
01:40:28,711 --> 01:40:29,910
this trace by the waterhole

3809
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:32,401
get live forever,

3810
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:33,234
bitch.

3811
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:34,500
It is what it is.

3812
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:34,890
That's,

3813
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:37,950
how did you come up with the
name Alpha male Alpha male?

3814
01:40:37,951 --> 01:40:38,160
I,

3815
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:42,450
while I was a human development major and
I just was studying all this different

3816
01:40:42,451 --> 01:40:44,550
stuff in school and I just
liked what it represented.

3817
01:40:44,551 --> 01:40:45,770
You know what I,

3818
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:46,410
you know,

3819
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:47,810
took cultural anthropology,

3820
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:51,720
physical anthropology and all
these different development
classes and stuff like

3821
01:40:51,721 --> 01:40:51,991
that.

3822
01:40:51,991 --> 01:40:54,160
Like my whole was just about

3823
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:54,880
people,

3824
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:55,690
you know,

3825
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:56,200
and,

3826
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,420
and things and how things happen,

3827
01:40:58,421 --> 01:40:58,721
you know.

3828
01:40:58,721 --> 01:40:59,490
And uh,

3829
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:01,810
I remember learning about these birds.

3830
01:41:01,811 --> 01:41:02,644
Like there's these,

3831
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,800
there's this certain type of bird where
these three birds land and the two

3832
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:09,334
sidekicks,

3833
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:11,740
they all do this dance together
and then the two side kicks,

3834
01:41:11,741 --> 01:41:13,420
kick rocks in the middle one gets laid,

3835
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:14,553
you know,

3836
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:15,591
it's like,

3837
01:41:15,591 --> 01:41:16,424
it's choreographed.

3838
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:20,080
These guys might have their opportunity
at sometime when it steps up and it's

3839
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:20,920
their turn.

3840
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:24,430
And then they talk about like these
packs of wolves that work together as a

3841
01:41:24,431 --> 01:41:24,911
team.

3842
01:41:24,911 --> 01:41:26,260
And then there's like the,

3843
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:29,980
the big macho gorilla that that
like is spreading a seat in.

3844
01:41:29,981 --> 01:41:31,750
And there's like the
little sneak dick monkeys,

3845
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:36,250
the guys that look at your runs in and
gets his hump in and like all these

3846
01:41:36,251 --> 01:41:37,300
different crazy stuff.

3847
01:41:37,301 --> 01:41:37,930
And like,

3848
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:42,930
it was just interesting to me about how
in humans there's this Alpha males in

3849
01:41:43,391 --> 01:41:44,141
every category.

3850
01:41:44,141 --> 01:41:45,790
I mean there's an Alpha male ballerina,

3851
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,080
there's an Alpha male,

3852
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:48,790
a frigging gay dude,

3853
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:49,870
there's an Alpha Male,

3854
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:50,531
you know,

3855
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:51,071
whatever.

3856
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:54,160
There's this like the top
dog in every category in,

3857
01:41:54,161 --> 01:41:56,110
it's kind of trips me out of how they are,

3858
01:41:56,111 --> 01:41:57,850
but it takes like being smart,

3859
01:41:57,851 --> 01:41:59,410
being good looking and being persuasive,

3860
01:41:59,411 --> 01:42:01,900
being hardworking and being,

3861
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:02,321
you know,

3862
01:42:02,321 --> 01:42:03,400
all these great things.

3863
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:05,170
And I figured that's the shit.

3864
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:07,460
It is honest in its approach.

3865
01:42:07,461 --> 01:42:07,731
I mean,

3866
01:42:07,731 --> 01:42:09,500
that is what everybody is trying to do.

3867
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:10,551
Whereas you know you,

3868
01:42:10,551 --> 01:42:11,150
you can,

3869
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:12,710
you can name it a bunch
of different things.

3870
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:13,131
But yeah,

3871
01:42:13,131 --> 01:42:14,840
it is trying to be the Alpha male.

3872
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:18,440
It's been the connotation of the
word that's sort of changed lately.

3873
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:19,483
It's gotten,

3874
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:21,260
it's become a tad douchey.

3875
01:42:21,261 --> 01:42:22,490
The word Alpha you,

3876
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:23,061
it's like a,

3877
01:42:23,061 --> 01:42:23,331
you know,

3878
01:42:23,331 --> 01:42:23,871
to do that.

3879
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:24,704
So Alpha,

3880
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,870
I like people like rag on you from that.

3881
01:42:26,871 --> 01:42:27,770
You never heard anybody say that.

3882
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:28,280
That's,

3883
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:29,540
people say that on online.

3884
01:42:29,541 --> 01:42:31,880
A lot like to rag on you
for something to that.

3885
01:42:31,881 --> 01:42:32,391
So Beta,

3886
01:42:32,391 --> 01:42:33,140
you're a Beta,

3887
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:36,050
you're being a Beta
Alpha and Beta is like a,

3888
01:42:36,051 --> 01:42:36,381
it's a,

3889
01:42:36,381 --> 01:42:37,214
it's a very,

3890
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:39,050
oh that's right Brian.

3891
01:42:39,051 --> 01:42:39,884
It's kind of recent.

3892
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:44,120
I mean I say that obviously
because we have a alpha brain,

3893
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:46,190
it opens itself up to criticism.

3894
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,140
That is what you're doing man.

3895
01:42:48,141 --> 01:42:48,381
You're,

3896
01:42:48,381 --> 01:42:48,611
you're,

3897
01:42:48,611 --> 01:42:50,990
you're Alpha male and the
motherfucking shit out of dudes.

3898
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:51,271
Yeah.

3899
01:42:51,271 --> 01:42:54,360
And I mean it basically that's what it
comes down and like who's it takes all

3900
01:42:54,361 --> 01:42:54,571
that.

3901
01:42:54,571 --> 01:42:56,280
So he takes like intelligence,

3902
01:42:56,281 --> 01:42:57,100
athleticism,

3903
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,230
some hard work,

3904
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:02,970
dedication and like you know the guys
that rise to the top in anything are,

3905
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:03,240
you know,

3906
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,410
made up of that same stuff.

3907
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:05,690
Whether it's like the top writer,

3908
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:06,580
the top journalists,

3909
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:07,423
the top anything

3910
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:07,861
they are.

3911
01:43:07,861 --> 01:43:10,800
But I think that one of the most difficult
past in the world is the one that

3912
01:43:10,801 --> 01:43:11,850
you've found success in.

3913
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:15,450
I think you are in one of the most
difficult businesses on the planet earth.

3914
01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:15,950
It's

3915
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:17,420
rough if it's not physically,

3916
01:43:17,421 --> 01:43:18,590
it's mentally taxing.

3917
01:43:18,591 --> 01:43:18,920
It's,

3918
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:22,220
it's a financially taxing when
you're getting going and that's,

3919
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:23,240
that's the crazy thing.

3920
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,460
I actually want to talk about that.

3921
01:43:25,461 --> 01:43:29,480
I've got a new thing that Phil Davis
and I are starting called MMA draft and

3922
01:43:29,481 --> 01:43:30,950
we've been working on it for a long time,

3923
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:34,550
but it's basically going to create
opportunities for these up and comers.

3924
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:39,940
It's like MMA draft is going to take
a guy like Phil Davis was a national

3925
01:43:39,951 --> 01:43:42,920
champion and start following
his career when he's a kid.

3926
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:46,130
Give him opportunity to like
shine as a kid and be like,

3927
01:43:46,131 --> 01:43:50,510
these are the top MMA prospects and start
covering all these different amateur

3928
01:43:50,511 --> 01:43:51,230
sides,

3929
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,041
Jujitsu,

3930
01:43:52,041 --> 01:43:52,874
wrestling,

3931
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:53,840
uh,

3932
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,790
I think we should even
cover some soccer stuff.

3933
01:43:55,791 --> 01:43:59,960
And there's so many soccer athletes
coming in there kicking man,

3934
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:02,450
just the deck story with the
legs and stuff like that.

3935
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:04,940
But they need to start,

3936
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:09,290

tiger woods and Lebron James and Michael

3937
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:13,670
Jordans of our sport and watch them grow
up as kids so that when a guy like Phil

3938
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:14,900

3939
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:15,793

lawns for the first four or five fights

3943
01:44:24,651 --> 01:44:26,560

one more little plug here to my guys.

3981
01:45:28,611 --> 01:45:32,570
I'm working on this new brand of equipment
and lifestyle stuff called torque.

3982
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:35,420
We're going to come out with
all sorts of new badass stuff,

3983
01:45:35,421 --> 01:45:37,030

3984
01:45:37,031 --> 01:45:38,480
At the torque one.

3985
01:45:38,481 --> 01:45:40,520
Dot Net is in the makes right now.

3986
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:41,570
We're going to have mats.

3987
01:45:41,571 --> 01:45:42,560
We're going to have gloves.

3988
01:45:42,561 --> 01:45:43,394
It's going to be awesome.

3989
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:44,930

3990
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:46,640
A torque one.net.

3991
01:45:46,641 --> 01:45:49,490
And my partner is actually
the guy that started Bsn,

3992
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:50,210
uh,

3993
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:52,400
Scott James and he's an
incredible businessman.

3994
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:55,120
He sold that company for a
lot of cash and he wants,

3995
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:56,330
he just loves him in May.

3996
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:57,040
And so,

3997
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:57,530
