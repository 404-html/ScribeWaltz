1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,490
Pendular listen,

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,910
I love the rent and if you want to
listen to it pendula at Sunday schools is

4
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:06,900
fucking amazing.

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,150
I want to meet him so bad.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,240
We didn't figure this out 10 years ago,

7
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:11,860
but come on.

8
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,450
That's a great,

9
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,283
that's a great Rancho.

10
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,430
De I'm wasting your time.

11
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,293
Gave me the talk to you.

12
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,893
We're talking to you.

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,993
I'm talking to you right now.

14
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,350
Welcome to me about what?

15
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,041
It's a business.

16
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:23,791
What the fuck do you want?

17
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,271
Nobody knows.

18
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:25,980
Prison is a business
and that's what it is.

19
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:27,200
It's a fucking business guys.

20
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,871
It's important.

21
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,300
When a guy like Jillette greatly,

22
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,610
I said,

23
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,443
boy,

24
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,160
you break the fucking law.

25
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,210
You go to jail.

26
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,000
You sell weed against
the law in 2010 bales,

27
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:36,780
you get caught.

28
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,613
You go to jail.

29
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,700
I went to jail.

30
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,900
I'm responsible.

31
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:40,890
I learned how to fucking.

32
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,401
That's it.

33
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:42,234
What are you going to do?

34
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,223
There's a law.

35
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,460
You cannot fucking do it.

36
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,294
You're going to go to jail.

37
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,300
Jail and prison are a fucking business.

38
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,830
They're a business.

39
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,160
That's why you didn't get a
ticket driving with the phone.

40
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,720
How much they tell you this.

41
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,950
How much they tell you this,

42
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,371
I don't know.

43
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:01,371
$25 until you go down to La County and
it's $225 because you've got to pay the

44
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:02,724
court costs,

45
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,691
the prison fee,

46
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:04,980
the judges vacation.

47
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:05,850
It's a,

48
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,410
it's a fucking business guys.

49
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,220
They're going to raise the taxes
now for fucking parking tickets.

50
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,331
It's a business.

51
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:13,530
What the fuck you want me to do?

52
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,240
This is the oldest conversation.

53
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:15,900
The book,

54
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,940
they should have legalized
this after they shot Kennedy.

55
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,043
They didn't.

56
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,640
We fucking fortunate that we live in
California and we don't have to abide by

57
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:24,060
this.

58
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,410
When was the last time
you were at a stone?

59
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:26,280
They kicked the door down.

60
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,113
Joe Rogan.

61
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,110
How about you my friend?

62
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,980
So all this shit,

63
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,680
you guys talk about
them kicking the doors.

64
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,380
The feds.

65
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,280
I've never seen it.

66
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,690
I can go get weed every day.

67
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,710
Stop scaring these fucking white
kids and getting them talking.

68
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:37,650
This is nonsense.

69
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,150
This is nonsense talk.

70
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,220
They should currently with Ya.

71
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,541
I never drink it.

72
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,350
So what?

73
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,340
So who gives a fuck?

74
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,010
It applies for everything going.

75
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,340
There's a lot of people who are in jail.

76
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,800
They get out every day
and a DNA or whatever.

77
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,910
You break the law.

78
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,170
You sell five pounds a week,

79
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,040
you got to go to jail.

80
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,360
It's a business.

81
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,740
You didn't do nothing wrong,

82
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,551
but it's a business.

83
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,600
They have guidelines.

84
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,720
If you get caught with
dirty 28 grams of blow,

85
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,120
you have to do a certain
amount of fucking time.

86
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,840
You get caught with a
quarter ounce of weed.

87
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,060
You have to do a certain amount of time.

88
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,871
You got caught with it.

89
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:10,410
Why are you crying to me for you got
caught when I was a criminal for 30 years.

90
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,790
You some you get caught with blow.

91
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,990
We eat or blow.

92
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:13,800
No,

93
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,611
you follow me.

94
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:15,960
There's a way to do it and there's a way,

95
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:16,760
not Tyler fucker.

96
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,500
You're going to get caught with fucking
weed and not think you're going to go to

97
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:19,801
jail.

98
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:23,730
If you live in fucking Ohio and in fucking
Kentucky or wherever you're going to

99
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,360
go to jail.

100
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,530
I kind of see your point,

101
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,600
but I also see his,

102
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,591
cause it's a,

103
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:29,490
it's an important man.

104
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:30,390
It's brilliant though.

105
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,403
It's important.

106
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,680
It's not together with Fallon
and the presence hip or what?

107
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,580
I don't give a fuck dog.

108
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,750
You don't care if I'm smoking.

109
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:36,961
Look,

110
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:37,640
look here.

111
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,480
This is what I think about
your whole drug thing.

112
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:43,170
Look like the same thing I rub my balls
with for the last 32 years with the

113
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,430
sativas and the bullshit.

114
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,660
Just get high dog.

115
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,320
You'd be breakthrough.

116
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,210
Much drama to the gift that God gave us.

117
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:52,044
A getting high.

118
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,250
You got too much drama.

119
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,701
I can't.

120
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:57,450
I've got to put a Dang at the end of the
joint to be cool while you're smoking

121
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,030
on the fucking electronic cigarette

122
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,300
and electronic.

123
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,481
What?

124
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,314
I'm smoking.

125
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,911
Think about that.

126
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:04,460
I'm smoking.

127
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,930
Okay?

128
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,940
That's all that matters
at the end of the week.

129
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:07,900
That's all that matters.

130
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,350
Fuck.

131
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,450
And people want to be
intelligent all the time.

132
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,160
We can't wait to see you
on the stage tonight.

133
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,510
No fucking stupid rare for people.

134
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,930
I'm three out of four people
in there for rape and murder.

135
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,171
What do you,

136
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:21,004
what are you telling me?

137
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,901
Showing me pause.

138
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,451
Calm down.

139
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,440
Who gives a fuck?

140
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,470
Who gives a fuck?

141
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,200
And to show people that you give a fuck.

142
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:26,801
Who gives a fuck?

143
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:27,440
I don't give a fuck.

144
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,240
I don't give a fuck.

145
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,250
I don't want people locked
up in jail for weed.

146
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,570
You know what my favorite
thing Joe came in here?

147
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,460
Jack boot thugs.

148
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,430
Violin fucking haul you
away for you a little.

149
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,050
I'm accountancy Pencil
comedian for 20 years.

150
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,330
I drink from time to time.

151
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,580
Did ever get behind
the car when I'm drunk,

152
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,540
I got a Dui.

153
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,111
That's a choice.

154
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,090
You make these all the choices you make,

155
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,810
bro.

156
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,450
So,

157
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,010
uh,

158
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,750
what are we getting that
I know it's illegal.

159
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:53,950
I know it should be legal and I know
that the John Lennon's want to make a

160
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:54,730
comeback,

161
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,563
but for today,

162
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,853
but for today,

163
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,840
2000 foot to tonight.

164
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,041
Well for today,

165
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,770
if you get caught smoking
and fucking in New York,

166
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:03,604
you're going to jail.

167
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,250
I don't care what you said,

168
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:05,441
bro.

169
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,310
I love hearing you talk.

170
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:06,760
I know.

171
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,181
Fuck.

172
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,560
I'm going to put up with this nonsense.

173
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,591
I Love Penn.

174
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:11,470
Jillette but that'll give them,

175
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,850
I was going off yesterday.

176
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,120
I was saying how Joey Diaz
will get mad about ketchup.

177
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,210
About,

178
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,430
oh,

179
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,100
this is going to be wanting to come up
with this fucking Heinz Ketchup or ranch.

180
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,380
Have you ever heard him
talking about ranch?

181
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:22,841
Oh,

182
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,770
I fucking hate rant.

183
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,750
I don't know how the fuck
people go eat that shit.

184
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,970
I don't know how people could be ranch.

185
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,770
I like when I go to a place and I say,

186
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,130
you all,

187
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,650
you have wings and they
say cubs are ranch.

188
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,840
I get up and leave even
if I don't get the wings.

189
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,030
Because if you're going
to serve wings ranch,

190
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,210
I don't want to do business with you.

191
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,870
I want to do business with you.

192
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,400
I'm very easy.

193
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm very fucking easy.

194
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,970
So if you fuck up pork fried rice,

195
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:46,930
what do we got to talk about?

196
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,690
Wings must be done with Gucci.

197
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,170
Gucci is,

198
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:49,330
yeah,

199
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,901
like the way of,

200
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:50,920
they invented in Buffalo,

201
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,251
New York,

202
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:52,084
and you got to do some electric.

203
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,643
Who would original.

204
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,980
You're going to show up with that Ras.

205
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:58,600
That's the most like somebody asked the
same wage ranch is starting to replace

206
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,080
ketchup.

207
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,231
Yeah,

208
00:04:59,231 --> 00:04:59,651
that's good.

209
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:03,010
If you're fucking hillbilly and you
want the taste of acid in your mouth all

210
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,844
fucking day.

211
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
I hate that fucking rich.

212
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,390
Don't put it close to me and I'll put it
around me and see the blue cheese with

213
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:11,600
wings and go fuck him up.

214
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,790
That's the next year.

215
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,091
All right,

216
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:13,924

217
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,753

218
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,310

219
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,130
I can say,

220
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:20,380
Ooh,

221
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,213

222
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,593

223
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,671

225
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,730
That's a mother fuckers.

226
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:34,470
I'm stoked.

227
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,303
Fucking

228
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,131

229
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:39,964

230
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,980

232
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,530
I lead my people around the ranch
like going in and I sit around me.

233
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,220
Do me that favor,

234
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,053

235
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,761
Freaks and Geeks.

236
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:22,511
Lovers and children.

237
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,980
What's going on ladies and gentlemen?
