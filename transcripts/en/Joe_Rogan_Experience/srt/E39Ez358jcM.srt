1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,213
Yeah.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,323
Hey fuckers.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,950
Can we go again?

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,750
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by taking a,

5
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,760
if you've never been to tink before
and you don't know what Tang is.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,120
One of the things that we like about a
company and like Tang is that we'd like

7
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:25,730
companies that are trying to be ethical,

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,020
trying to not fuck people over and like
that's like a part of their ethic that's

9
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:30,551
like the what,

10
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:34,340
what they're trying to accomplish in
business is not just to make money,

11
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:36,030
but to have a company that is like,

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,130
it's fair.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,360
And one of the cool things that
tain does is they have no contracts.

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,120
I love that they're on
the sprints backbone.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,170
I love that.

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,801
So it's like,

17
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:46,011
you know,

18
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:47,150
you get good service,

19
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,870
you get a big name company behind it is
a giant national company and it's the

20
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:54,470
backbone that you're on
and you get to bodies.

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,221
Awesome.

22
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,840
Android phones are like top of the line,

23
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,970
android phones and you can
cancel anytime you want.

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,370
You can have you and
your wife on an account,

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,070
although I don't think that's it.

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,660
That's not going to,

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:03,860
yeah,

28
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,120
know that's kind of a bitch.

29
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,253
Middle.

30
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,010
Yeah.

31
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,150
You share minutes.

32
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:08,481
I mean,

33
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:08,990
you can,

34
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,221
it's,

35
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:10,041
it's a really,

36
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:10,590
uh,

37
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,350
it's really cool setup.

38
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,400
The way it works.

39
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:15,590
If you don't use a
certain amount of minutes,

40
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,430
like if you're,

41
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:16,701
you know,

42
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,560
you assign yourself off for one program,

43
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:22,970
but it turns out that you actually only
use the amount of minutes would be in a

44
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:23,690
lower program.

45
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,040
They just send you the money back.

46
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:25,261
They,

47
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:25,580
they,

48
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,290
they hook you up on the next bill.

49
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,000
It's like the way they do it.

50
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:29,834
It's so cool.

51
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,520
That's why we don't have it in England.

52
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,530
That's why not in England
do you get fucked?

53
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,580
We got fucked.

54
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,160
Yeah.

55
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,961
I don't know.

56
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:37,490
I don't know if it's
because we're an island,

57
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,130
so we're separated.

58
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,020
So your cell phones are more expensive.

59
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,640
Does that make sense?

60
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,391
Yeah,

61
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:45,224
it does.

62
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,340
Yeah.

63
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,350
Because someone has to
set up the infrastructure,

64
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:49,150
right?

65
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,120
Everything's more expensive.

66
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,570
Well,

67
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,820
that they have here at Tang,

68
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,370
they have something called a sprint.

69
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,171
Err,

70
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:55,690
err,

71
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,080
err,

72
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,261
err,

73
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:57,010
rave.

74
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,641
And what it is,

75
00:01:57,641 --> 00:02:00,910
it's a plugs into your internet at your
house and it makes your own cell phone

76
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:03,580
tower in your house because
they're usually at your house.

77
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,490
And if you don't have good cell phone
network around your house and blows.

78
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,210
So what this does is it pretty much makes
your own cell phone tower out of your

79
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:10,750
house.

80
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,310
So you always have good service.

81
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,190
That's amazing.

82
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,140
So that would have the internet.

83
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:14,311
Yeah.

84
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,420
So 10 actually has this right now.

85
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,990
Uh,

86
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,460
it's four to 54,

87
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,323
which is really good.

88
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,980
We need cell phone service at your house.

89
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:21,940
That's important.

90
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,740
And if you go to Rogan,

91
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,180
[inaudible]

92
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,100
dot com you'll save 25 bucks off
of either service or you know,

93
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,060
or the phone.

94
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,930
Um,

95
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,501
you could,

96
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,390
you could use it in,

97
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,240
in any way you like.

98
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:32,931
And like I said,

99
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:33,320
we have,

100
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,670
they have the top of the line,

101
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,050
android mobile phones,

102
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:38,600
like Samsung Galaxy s three,

103
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,270
the Samsung Galaxy note to,

104
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,260
have you seen that thing?

105
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,460
Oh my God,

106
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,330
I gotta get one of those.

107
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,470
I keep talking about it.

108
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:46,610
I just don't have the time.

109
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:51,611
James Thompson to go out there and get
one of them bitches look good with Matt.

110
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:52,791
Yeah,

111
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,331
I've met,

112
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:54,530
I would have to have a bum bag.

113
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:55,160
Right.

114
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,950
I have mad a screen envy when
it comes to those things.

115
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,371
Anyway,

116
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:00,780
go to rogan.ting.com and
save yourself some money.

117
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:01,830
Yo a little fuckers.

118
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:02,820
Uh,

119
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,440
we are also brought to you by audible.com
and if you go to audible.com forward

120
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:08,340
slash Joe,

121
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,030
you will get one free month of their
awesome service and you will also get one

122
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:15,240
free audio book.

123
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,810
You know,

124
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,790
one of the cool things about audible's,

125
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,211
first of all,

126
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:20,040
they've been around a long time.

127
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,790
Audible used to do stuff with
comedians like way back in the day,

128
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:28,530
I want to say like 2001 ish when they
were releasing like they got guys like,

129
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:31,800
I know Steve Marmel did it and I know
a few other guys were doing it as well,

130
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:35,370
where they would do like a
new five minutes every week
and they would release it

131
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:36,204
on audible.

132
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,400
It's kind of a tough sell.

133
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,420
But they tried,

134
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:39,691
you know,

135
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:39,841
they,

136
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:40,051
they,

137
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:40,321
they,

138
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,370
they gave him the shot.

139
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,200
They have some balls and uh,

140
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:44,760
I appreciate that they did that.

141
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:45,960
I don't know if they
still do that anymore.

142
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:47,220
I probably shouldn't say they tried.

143
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,380
Maybe that's like a big feature,

144
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,071
but,

145
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:50,490
um,

146
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm a big fan of the
audio book format and uh,

147
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,470
the disaster diaries,

148
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,161
um,

149
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:57,510
which was Sam Sheridan's book,

150
00:03:57,511 --> 00:04:00,450
the guy who was just here
yesterday is available.

151
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,680
That's what I would recommend.

152
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:02,730
If you want to get a new book,

153
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,200
it's to check checkout.

154
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,430
It's a fascinating,

155
00:04:05,431 --> 00:04:06,300
fascinating book.

156
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,400
And it's read by some other dude,

157
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:12,810
but some dude named Donald Korn and I'm
sure Donald did a good job and all that.

158
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:13,501
I'm not saying he's not,

159
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:14,670
but why wouldn't you have Sam,

160
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,920
Sarah at Sheridan Read Sam
Sheridan's fucking book.

161
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,270
Maybe this is Sam's partner.

162
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,991
No,

163
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:19,890
I think it's like,

164
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,311
you know,

165
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:21,580
probably the book company.

166
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:21,980
It was like,

167
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,460
I think we should get an actor.

168
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,060
I mean,

169
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,541
listen,

170
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:24,991
Sam,

171
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:26,520
he rode a captivating speaker,

172
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:31,260
but we need that extra professional touch
to really push your audio book to the

173
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:32,400
top of the charts.

174
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,721
And sound was like,

175
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:34,554
all right,

176
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,970
I think it's more likely that,

177
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:36,540
right?

178
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:36,820
I,

179
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,031
yeah,

180
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:37,450
I think so.

181
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,950
I would recommend that opie and Anthony,

182
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,280
uh,

183
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
audible book last week,

184
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,090
they had the gay off episode.

185
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:43,880
Uh,

186
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,330
so they have the opening
Anthony show there.

187
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:46,701
What is it?

188
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:46,970
Yeah,

189
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,620
but so is there a name of that?

190
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,390
The gay off episodes
where people can specific

191
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:50,661
it?

192
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,340
Search for it actually called,

193
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,910
uh,

194
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,260
the gay off and it's February 13th,

195
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,400
2013 with Andrew dice clay
and they have it on audible.

196
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,550
And I believe each episode you
can either do a subscription,

197
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:07,280
so you always get the Ogun
Anthony show or you get a,

198
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,720
if you sign up through your thing,

199
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:09,321
you get a,

200
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:11,360
I think a free audible book.

201
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,570
Don't,

202
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,630
you should get one free audio book so
you can just get it free right now.

203
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:15,560
Just sign up right now.

204
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,480
Get this one episode and laugh
your fucking ass off and cringe.

205
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:19,840
And,

206
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,350
and,

207
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,280
and by the way,

208
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,390
just a massive amount of books
that you can choose from.

209
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,781
It's a,

210
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:26,920
it's an awesome service.

211
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,750
One of the cool things they have is a,

212
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:30,350
an application for,

213
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:31,184
um,

214
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,230
the Amazon kindle and the kindle fire HD.

215
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,921
And what it is,

216
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,431
is the,

217
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:40,390
the audible whisper sync application.

218
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,760
What it does is if you're
reading a book at night,

219
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,770
so you'd be stopped on page 300.

220
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,840
When you get in your car,

221
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:51,370
it's syncs up and starts the audio
version of the book you're reading.

222
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,390
It's fucking fantastic.

223
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:53,260
It's a brilliant idea.

224
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,190
It's like one of the,

225
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,070
one of the coolest things
for like driving it driving

226
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,491
actually.

227
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,324
Interesting.

228
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,180
So a go to audible.com
go and check that out.

229
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,180
We were also brought to you
by on it as we are every week.

230
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,421
O,

231
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,710
n n I t.

232
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,420
Um,

233
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,021
we have a,

234
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:10,520
a new testosterone supplement.

235
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,181
James Thompson,

236
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:14,090
you might be interested in that if
you're looking to get extra swole.

237
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,920
I don't think he needs a hope.

238
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,830
You're in to get an extra swole.

239
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,001
Now you,

240
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:20,241
uh,

241
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,200
you actually lost weight,

242
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,530
right?

243
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,120
You were a little bit
bigger at one point in time.

244
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,950
I've been up and down all the time.

245
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,813
Yeah.

246
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,870
Do you like try to figure out like
what feels like where you're at your

247
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,441
strongest?

248
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:30,591
Where?

249
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:30,980
Yay.

250
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,420
Is it like a sacrifice thing?

251
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,920
When it,

252
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,950
let me get through this commercial.

253
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,030
We'll get to that because it was like,

254
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,500
I have a lot of fucking
questions for you man.

255
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,540
Anyway,

256
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,400

257

save 10% of any and all supplements.

258
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,300
We've got a lot of cool shit.

259
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:42,841
It's too cold.

260
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:44,420
You what's happening?

261
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,613
What's it called?

262
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,810
This testosterone.

263
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,080
It's called t plus.

264
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,070
It's got 'em all sorts of natural shit.

265
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,790
Mucuna Purina's it helps elevate natural
dopamine levels and magnesium is ferric

266
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:58,851
acid.

267
00:06:58,851 --> 00:06:59,550
It was just some,

268
00:06:59,550 --> 00:06:59,780
uh,

269
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,780
it's a supplement that's shown him one
test to increase free testosterone by

270
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,650
42%.

271
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,513
So it's called,

272
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,910
it's got magnesium and yeah.

273
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,401
Well yeah,

274
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,030
that's one of them.

275
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,241
Yeah.

276
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,110
It's one of the ingredients.

277
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:12,861
You know,

278
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,000
we were talking about the zinc,

279
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,260
magnesium supplement,

280
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:15,951
that CNA stuff,

281
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:18,230
which is a very good for you and
it can increase testosterone.

282
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,290
But apparently what they're saying
is it increases it in people who are

283
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,340
deficient in zinc,

284
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,020
which is most of us apparently.

285
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,410
Yeah.

286
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,000
Apparently most people
aren't getting enough zinc.

287
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,950
I do it almost five times a week now.

288
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,300
You make it does make me feel better,

289
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,060
right?

290
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,830
Yeah.

291
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,400
Yeah.

292
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,850
Yeah.

293
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,260
I'm a big fan of zinc.

294
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,020
I think there's something
in that net Zma uh,

295
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,491
that's uh,

296
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:40,370
an interesting supplement and one of the
things is also they think it helps you

297
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,610
recover better and build your testosterone
more because you're getting more

298
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:43,940
sleep.

299
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,151
Yeah.

300
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:44,984
Like a deeper sleep.

301
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,220
You go to like that the deepest level of
sleep usually don't get too addicted to

302
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:49,430
it.

303
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,300
Do you think like with them I see him,

304
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,600
I just know like if I'm
traveling or if I'm like,

305
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:53,891
you know what,

306
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,430
I need to go to sleep and I'm not tired.

307
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,570
I'll just play on the Internet all day.

308
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,910
I'll just take it like offering it up.

309
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,990
You were offering it at all?

310
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,860
I would like this kids is EMA free fruit.

311
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,310
Zma like crazy.

312
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,890
I go love is something you
really needed in your diet.

313
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,610
Yeah,

314
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,211
definitely.

315
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:08,750
Definitely.

316
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,350
Yeah.

317
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,660
Obviously that's so basically he's,

318
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,733
he's worked.

319
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,550
Yeah.

320
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:13,701
Yeah.

321
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,680
I think a lot of us
are deficient and shit.

322
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,730
We just don't realize it man.

323
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,160
But he didn't get cramps
in their potassium.

324
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:21,260
Apparently it was why you get cramps?

325
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,550
I get cramps,

326
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,360
you know,

327
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,900
sleep and you wake up screaming
because he accidentally got it.

328
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,070
Gives a Charlie horse in the middle
of the night from dehydration.

329
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,700
Probably you're an unhealthy
fucking charley houses.

330
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,900
You don't know what Charlie Horses,

331
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,790
um,

332
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,320
Charlie horses when like
something like stiffens up on you.

333
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,290
There's two different ways that like some
people called Charlie who is a punch,

334
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:46,070
like a punch in the shoulder or
punching a leg that it means something

335
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:46,940
completely different.

336
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:47,810
But England,

337
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,190
is that what they call a Charley horse?

338
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,680
No,

339
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,470
we've got like pumped
in the almond England.

340
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:51,831
Yeah.

341
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,590
What does that pumped down?

342
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,770
Did just call punched in the arm.

343
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,020
That's probably a better
way of dealing with why.

344
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
Why would the silly fucking nicknames
and have to relearn how many halls?

345
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,230
Slug bug is what it's called.

346
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,880
The United States beetle.

347
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,851
A Volkswagen.

348
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:04,970
Yeah.

349
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:05,900
He told me about this.

350
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:06,920
I didn't know this existed.

351
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,890
There's a lot of people in the
country and this country in America,

352
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,700
Mr. Thompson,

353
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,440
they're just looking for an
excuse to hit each other.

354
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,200
So they'd come up with
games where it's friends

355
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,990
fucking asshole.

356
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,460
We're a country of assholes
on it.com not assholes.

357
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,580
Go use the code rogue and saved 10% go
get yourself a Blendtec blender and some

358
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,640
fucking kettlebells so you could
be manly like James Thompson.

359
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,060
All right,

360
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,073
we're here.

361
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,831
We're queer.

362
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:34,664
Get used to it.

363
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,340
Started to roll the podcast

364
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,160
experience.

365
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,850
Powerful.

366
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:48,080
James Thompson.

367
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,951
Welcome aboard,

368
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:49,250
sir.

369
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,480
Thank you very much for coming on,

370
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:50,930
man.

371
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,640
I was very excited to talk to you.

372
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,211
I know,

373
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:53,960
I know.

374
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,340
It's going to be fun because,

375
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:55,630
uh,

376
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:55,890
you're,

377
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,650
you're a character that
I've enjoyed for many,

378
00:09:57,651 --> 00:10:00,440
many years in the world
of mixed martial arts.

379
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,640
I remember the first fight that you had
with Alexander Milliken Aiko and pride

380
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,870
when you came,

381
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,703
I don't remember.

382
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,780
You went bananas,

383
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:12,291
man.

384
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:17,291
You took it to 100 miles an hour from
the moment the bell rang and you just red

385
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:18,574
line that bitch.

386
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,573
And you know,

387
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,360
it didn't,

388
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,560
I mean it was a crazy fight,

389
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:22,340
but you don't eat.

390
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,630
When that fight happened,

391
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,650
you'd only been doing martial arts
training for a shorter amount of time.

392
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:27,890
Right.

393
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,060
Doing it for a year.

394
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:29,550
Now

395
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,610
I know I worked,

396
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,381
I was,

397
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,214
um,

398
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,970
I didn't do anything before pop foam.

399
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,760
Um,

400
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,750
before my first fight,

401
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,930
I had a platform,

402
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,631
I don't know,

403
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,910
six months veselin good wrestling.

404
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,070
And then I saw,

405
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:50,090
I may put myself in for a contest six
weeks later and I thought to myself,

406
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:51,930
we're doing,

407
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,241
I wasn't,

408
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:54,250
it wasn't like a camp.

409
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,820
It was a class three times a
week and that did other things.

410
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:58,870
I'm self different,

411
00:10:58,871 --> 00:10:59,411
cardio,

412
00:10:59,411 --> 00:10:59,951
different this,

413
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:00,784
different that.

414
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,990
So that's what I did.

415
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:02,650
I made it,

416
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,640
put it all together,

417
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,530
did my class of MMA,

418
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,401
and then,

419
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:06,970
uh,

420
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,930
after like three,

421
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:08,820
four weeks of hot,

422
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,503
I'm ready for a fight.

423
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,650
Not because I'm,

424
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:13,870
I would again,

425
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,250
or just yourself.

426
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,113
Well,

427
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,510
I just fault I didn't realize
how much the words to it.

428
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,200
Uh,

429
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,940
I didn't get how deep it was.

430
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,770
Like looking at it from the outside.

431
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,540
That's doing a little bit simple.

432
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,740
Yeah.

433
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:26,900
Well,

434
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,820
you're a huge guy.

435
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,121
Yeah.

436
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,080
So your whole life,

437
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:30,130
you've been a huge guy,

438
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:30,870
I'm sure.

439
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,380
So you probably not used to being
around you were smaller and smaller,

440
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:36,214
if that makes sense.

441
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,930
But you know like so your,

442
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:38,500
your,

443
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,500
your look at the sport of MMA was probably
not from even as from a position of

444
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:45,311
like,

445
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:46,330
why don't I fucking do this?

446
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,500
Like I'm designed for this shit.

447
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,070
Well I can kind of,

448
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:49,904
because

449
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,970
I always wonder why
didn't I know do boxing

450
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:53,690
right.

451
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,260
Why didn't you,

452
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,093
what did you do?

453
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,723
Okay.

454
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,220
It looks like you picked
up a lot of heavy shit.

455
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,000
Did you do that video game?

456
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,480
I would look in back home in a
flashback to be molested or something.

457
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,910
Like I was going to stop
breaking down in tears,

458
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,300
you know,

459
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,010
if we can all know what if I opened there?

460
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,180
What sports did you do?

461
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,240
Book pay.

462
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,700
I was very good at rugby.

463
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,590
Rugby in my opinion,

464
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,610
sacrilege.

465
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,200
People will say sacrilege.

466
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,630
It's just inherently more
badass than football.

467
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,250
There's no question.

468
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,630
This put this pad thing is ridiculous
and I know we've accepted it.

469
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,171
Pads.

470
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:31,130
They were the football players,

471
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:32,490
the pads and helmets and shit.

472
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,150
Oh,

473
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,983
American football,

474
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,873
American football.

475
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,993
Not Soccer,

476
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,053
soccer obviously,

477
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,410
but American footballs,

478
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,540
the idea is ridiculous.

479
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,340
Pad yourself up and running each other.

480
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,580
Full clip rugby.

481
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,480
To me it's like you got like a
little leather thing in your head,

482
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:48,314
but

483
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,770
sometimes it protects
your ears for falling off,

484
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,070
so don't go fuck fucking call it.

485
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,820
It's just more bad ass.

486
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,470
It seems like a more bad ass port,

487
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,950
you know?

488
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,730
I think different ways like
Vulckbie it's fucking tough.

489
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,740
I don't know if some people,

490
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,790
some guys off,

491
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,570
you know,

492
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,630
professional fighters and then
obviously doing over things.

493
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:09,381
I'm voc bop.

494
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:10,660
One of them I'll tell you.

495
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:10,971
Oh yeah,

496
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:11,480
I had a book.

497
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,400
Maybe you play vogue behind you fight.

498
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,090
Wow.

499
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,770
Fuck you got an injury,

500
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,690
so get people step on you.

501
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,553
Oh yeah.

502
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:18,950
Fuck.

503
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,990
When you go on the train
and they got the heels on,

504
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:21,260
they,

505
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,940
oh yeah.

506
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,370
When I,

507
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,390
when I first started playing,

508
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:24,171
I couldn't believe it.

509
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,130
I was getting stumped.

510
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:25,521
Telephone.

511
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,930
What are you fucking stump him in?

512
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,220
I ended up popping a fight on the,

513
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,830
okay,

514
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,240
no pub in a fight on the pitch.

515
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,570
It's really common to have fights
in rugby isn't very common,

516
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,790
which is so cool cause stumping.

517
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,150
Yeah,

518
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,830
it's so close to a fight.

519
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,930
It's like three quarters of a fight,

520
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,943
you know,

521
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,270
and you get into the scrubs.

522
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,340
It's like three quarters
of a fight going on.

523
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:48,710
It's amazing that it's not
like a constant length.

524
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,140
I didn't do it in a war.

525
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,513
Well,

526
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,690
I mean I,

527
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,241
you know,

528
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:53,570
I've,

529
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,230
I've,

530
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,910
I've enjoyed football games before.

531
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:58,940
It's not that I don't get the appeal
of watching a great football player.

532
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,350
I absolutely do.

533
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:01,070
But I'm like,

534
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,320
I would love to see those
athletes play rugby.

535
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,730
I would love to see what would happen.

536
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:06,200
It would be like a band and football.

537
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,580
I think it's fun to watch.

538
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,720
It's craziness,

539
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:09,554
man.

540
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,423
Yeah.

541
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,530
Posh people do it.

542
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,330
Posh people in England.

543
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,991
I love that word,

544
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:15,824
by the way,

545
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,670
Steven fucking great way
of describing things.

546
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,890
Such a few words.

547
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,420
I've really like,

548
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:25,910
it started to appreciate
Larry like proper,

549
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,460
that's a proper car.

550
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,290
You know,

551
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,060
proper is a,

552
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,060
that's a Badass.

553
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,190
A Batoche what?

554
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,460
Posh is another one.

555
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:35,940
I like posh posh.

556
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,230
Then sometimes you fit out popper posh.

557
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,190
Oh,

558
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,630
proper posture is gangster,

559
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,464
right?

560
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,041
Yeah.

561
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,020
That's when you go over to someone's
house and they got a peacock.

562
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,511
Shit's proper.

563
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:52,030
Posh dudes have like fucking
statutes themselves and

564
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,340

567
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,360

568
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,990

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,180

573
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,700
He created a statue of her in a fountain.

574
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,330
Wow.

575
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:11,930

593
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:35,170

Do you know he's not inside his house.

603
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,320
He's not inside his house.

604
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,180
It's fucking outside his house.

605
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,270
Same.

606
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,710
So everyone can see it.

607
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,140
He can't even fucking see it.

608
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,503
You can see it.

609
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,400
So they just sticking his
dick out of his front yard.

610
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,031

I forget I'm an east deck.

614
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,241

615
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:10,901
but I'm saying,

616
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:11,410

It's pretty well known.

626
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,820
Just kind of like we slept together.

627
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,830
You remember when Lean Mary had that
mural made of him wrangling Jorge Rivera.

628
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,530
That's what I was going to mention.

629
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,120
But cause I know Leah novel,

630
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,260
I love that guy.

631
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,970
He's a character.

632
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:47,390
I know he's a criminal and all that
jazz and he's done a lot of bad things.

633
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,231
I understand.

634
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:48,411
I mean,

635
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:49,730
I wouldn't want to be on his bad side,

636
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:50,181
that's for sure.

637
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:53,120
But he's so entertaining,

638
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,400
so crazy.

639
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:55,234

640
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,440
I mean I,

641
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,730
he trained up London.

642
00:16:57,731 --> 00:16:59,270
Shoot while you still trained.

643
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,630
I started training the chill stuff to,

644
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,260
he laughed.

645
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,250
But I did do a,

646
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:04,084
um,

647
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,141
like a game,

648
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:05,831
a video game,

649
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:10,810
cute with him and it was just off
to being stopped on eat coming up.

650
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:11,200
They'll spot,

651
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,611
he was vague.

652
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:12,970
Finn Looking,

653
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,433
you know,

654
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,990
I'm used to say name like
everyone else at events,

655
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,123
you know,

656
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,691
event or not.

657
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:20,140
He always calls,

658
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,340
you know quite no,

659
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:24,420
not mostly about lean and I'm healthy.

660
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,160
I know when I saw him he just vaguely,

661
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,530
they drone on fucking owl.

662
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,330
I'm not to what he lives everyday,

663
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,750
you know,

664
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,470
that kind of shit.

665
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,130
Getting stopped shooting like
literally some of stores and you know,

666
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,090
go over the top and
people get carried away,

667
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:41,580
especially in Italian gangster stories.

668
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,670
But there was some from so many good
people who I know who were there and

669
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,940
they're like fucking owl valley.

670
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:49,760

671
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,420

672
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,780
I mean massive fights.

673
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:55,900

676
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,170
Tito has one version of it
and Pat Miletich and the
other guys that were there

677
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,050
have another version of it.

678
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:07,160
But the bottom line was somehow
they've gotten some sort of a fight.

679
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,013
I don't believe too,

680
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,160
I could never say it wasn't there,

681
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,023
but

682
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,710
I wasn't that I actually started it.

683
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,600
I didn't,

684
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,333
I'm just saying.

685
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,820
But um,

686
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,820
he was a part allegedly of a lot
of people don't know the story.

687
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,840
The biggest bank robbery
in the history of England,

688
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,350
right?

689
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,090
Yeah.

690
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,520
No,

691
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:32,970
no,

692
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,490
that is fucking crazy.

693
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,320
If you look at the security cam footage,

694
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,360
it's like you looking at us,

695
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,320
the rest are stolen movie and I get done.

696
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:41,640
Even like a Guy Ritchie movie,

697
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,270
it's like it's not,

698
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,760
this is not,

699
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,620
this can't be real.

700
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,540
They can't be dressed with ski goggles
on and commando outfits and machine guns

701
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,390
and they can't be really robbing
a bank cause this is just bananas.

702
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,170
When they did it,

703
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,320
it was a bank upon it,

704
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:54,810
which I thought more show too.

705
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,940
I'm the reason why they didn't,

706
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:57,880
I thought more secure security.

707
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,290
So no one knows what it is.

708
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,870
Like it takes a blank building with,

709
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,830
obviously he's going to be fucking secure,

710
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,920
but ultimately,

711
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,730
oh cause they don't want
to talk to tension to it.

712
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,840
So that's why they think
Kenny's got be an inside job,

713
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,550
which you kind of look up anyway.

714
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,460
I think a lot of that stuff
is probably inside job.

715
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,300
If you're making 50 grand a year and
you're working in a place like that,

716
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,490
you know how much does
that fuck with your head?

717
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,570
Imagine you can see that money
going back and forth every day.

718
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,650
La,

719
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,770
you're just standing there watching it
and you're just a banker and you're a

720
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:32,371
banker and you're like,

721
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,780
how do I ever get rich as I can
eat right and falling on my face?

722
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:37,800
And you got a crazy cousin.

723
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,600
He'd tell that crazy cousin
when you're drinking.

724
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,933
Who knows?

725
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,570
Would be a way we can rob it.

726
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:42,761
I mean,

727
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:43,740
and we shouldn't rob it,

728
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:47,400
but next thing he knows it and you
cousin starts spreading out the math and

729
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,690
you're smoking meth with
him and you're like,

730
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:51,480
we're gonna rob this guy.

731
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,460
Let's go fucking math.

732
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,480
Yeah,

733
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:00,991
those are,

734
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,530
those are a rock salt because
it's like it's somehow or another,

735
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:06,120
it's supposed to give off good energy.

736
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,980
I don't know if that's horse shit or not,

737
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,850
but I'm going to go Melissa Etheridge
on this bitch and just sewed shipped it.

738
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:12,900
It is,

739
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,733
it is salt,

740
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,880
but it's kind of cool.

741
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,200
But whenever I talk about him

742
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,723
a couple months,

743
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,270
maybe a month or so,

744
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,750
do you feel much goodwill?

745
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,620
I'm not sure.

746
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,390
Pretty Thompson.

747
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,260
I don't know if that's,

748
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,580
I don't know if it's the rocks.

749
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,750
That's the problem with,

750
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:28,380
uh,

751
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,430
a lot of different things.

752
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:32,220
It's like how much of
it is a placebo effect?

753
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,890
Why does a fucking placebo effect work?

754
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,740
That's,

755
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:35,940
well,

756
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,930
that's a weird thing,

757
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:37,510
man.

758
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,281
Why does that work?

759
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:39,150
Because you believe it.

760
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:39,601
Yeah,

761
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,970
but why does it actually work sometimes?

762
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,110
Because you believe it.

763
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,740
I know,

764
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,160
but scientifically what the fuck is going
on with your mind that your mind can

765
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:51,610
take a pill and think
it does something good?

766
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,410
So all of a sudden it
does do something good.

767
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:53,621
I mean,

768
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:57,360
that is a amazing property
of the human body is,

769
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,323
um,

770
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,270
I'm,

771
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,220
this is what I'm saying.

772
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,803
If you,

773
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,340
if you believe it,

774
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,820
if you,

775
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,110
Oh,

776
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,550
I've gone all Murphy average.

777
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:07,384
The fucking,

778
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,960
you've touched with the
crystals and the power source.

779
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,380
Thomson.

780
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,210
Just go with your feelings
when I'm express yourself.

781
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,900
Express yourself.

782
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,091
No,

783
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:15,850
I,

784
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,290
when I listened to that podcast,

785
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,453
I know I,

786
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,330
for me,

787
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,410
she's quite hippie.

788
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,453
Melissa Etheridge,

789
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,893
she was awesome.

790
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,120
Beautiful Person.

791
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,013
I,

792
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,570
I sold much of what she said.

793
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:28,871
I was like,

794
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,470
yes,

795
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,190
she's had,

796
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,300
she's had the secret.

797
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,350
It's like the fuck.

798
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:33,184
Like she liked it,

799
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,821
which are the,

800
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:38,140
it's like the fast food of positive
thinking and all that easy fix.

801
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,300
And I thought what a great
way to sum it all up.

802
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,831
Yeah.

803
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:44,250
I don't know if she's right about her.

804
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,680
Her idea was that you sort of
manifest reality from your own mind,

805
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,430
your imagination.

806
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,360
But she might be right.

807
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,230
I don't know.

808
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:50,621
I mean,

809
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:52,390
I don't necessarily believe it,

810
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,860
but I know this,

811
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,521
believe it either.

812
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:58,510
I think it's an interesting possibility
to consider or it might be a combination

813
00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:58,830
of,

814
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,110
you know,

815
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,870
random events and how much you guide
it with your own thoughts and their own

816
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,600
mind.

817
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,380
The phone.

818
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:04,660
Well,

819
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,220
I don't think anyone does and that's fair.

820
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,780
I was listening to her.

821
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,473
I was like,

822
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,000
wow.

823
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,770
Yeah,

824
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,531
I'm not green,

825
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,500
but scene where she's coming from and yet,

826
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:14,861
okay,

827
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:15,460
wow.

828
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,420
And a lot of it and then,

829
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,050
but it seemed a bit too definite
like that that's the way it is.

830
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:20,980
And she would say,

831
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,350
I think that's the way east to her.

832
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:23,651
Yeah.

833
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:25,210
So therefore it's so,

834
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,600
well I also think she would say
it's very self serving to be,

835
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,110
I mean self serving in a positive way
to be definite because if you want to

836
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:33,010
believe in something,

837
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:35,140
like if you want to really
believe in something,

838
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:39,610
you have to believe in 100% for it to
work home didn't have a placebo effect

839
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:41,200
where actually I think that's not true.

840
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,030
I think there's been a study that showed
that they did give people placebos and

841
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,860
tell them there was a placebo.

842
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,020
It's still have a measurable effect.

843
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,280
Uh,

844
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,510
some pill that they gave him,

845
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,860
like they knew the whole time,

846
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:54,790
it was just a fake pill,

847
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,680
but it's still works.

848
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,260
And I think those are like the same
people that you could hypnotize.

849
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,810
You know,

850
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,643
there's some,

851
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,710
you can hypnotize everyone.

852
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,690
Everybody,

853
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,870
everybody 100%.

854
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,330
You can hypnotize them
as long as I relaxed.

855
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,300
So you would say,

856
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:10,601
well,

857
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:13,180
you weren't relaxed because
I'm going to hit a to you now.

858
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,800
You would definitely tend to up.

859
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,451
I haven't.

860
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:15,760
No.

861
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,061
You know,

862
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:20,080
I talked to a guy who can assist and he
said that some people you can hypnotize

863
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:20,410
you,

864
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,230
but that was his word because they won't
let themselves to relax that you treat

865
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,064
as a stat.

866
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,810
I don't think I would ever
let anybody run my thoughts.

867
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,280
Exactly.

868
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,220
It's not that I wouldn't,

869
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:31,660
it's not that I wouldn't relax.

870
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,860
I'm absolutely,

871
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,420
I could absolutely relaxed,

872
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,230
but I would.

873
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,890
I'm not really into letting
other people run that,

874
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,593
getting sleeping.

875
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,153
No.

876
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,220
I know what I'm getting done.

877
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,413
All the,

878
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,930
I'm really relaxed.

879
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,250
You're not going into my head.

880
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,910
I think that the guy was
hypnotizing you is dumber than you.

881
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,470
Right.

882
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,020
There's no way,

883
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,671
mother fucker,

884
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:54,950
there's no way you can
it up with some shit.

885
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,310
That's what I see.

886
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,670
I thought I'd looked.

887
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,020
See Devin down prone on it.

888
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,450
You Watch it.

889
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:00,870
Shit.

890
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,380
I know.

891
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,010
I've heard of them.

892
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,843
Oh mate,

893
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,290
is he hit me this as well.

894
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,050
He's a magician.

895
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,171
No,

896
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:05,341
no,

897
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:05,521
no.

898
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:05,760
Eat,

899
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:05,911
no,

900
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:06,061
no,

901
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:06,240
no.

902
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,650
It's in between these kind of like,

903
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:07,870
hey,

904
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:08,703
this ball.

905
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,070
Yeah,

906
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,300
just to do super trickster.

907
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:12,481
Yeah,

908
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:12,601
he,

909
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:13,110
yeah,

910
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,700
he's a super quick story
is he told us some of it.

911
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:18,210
He says,

912
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,280
this is why it's a trick.

913
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,860
[inaudible] had explained
why it's this and that.

914
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,723
I'm white.

915
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,310
I'm the only one he didn't get right.

916
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,650
And this where I really me to,

917
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,260
to the guy fucking going to go to the
bank and got him to get tank vanned out

918
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:33,480
of,

919
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,500
out of its own account.

920
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,330
Then he said to him,

921
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,790
he got this guy by random and then you
took him to a roulette finger and he

922
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:43,980
said,

923
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,813
right,

924
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,830
I'm going to get you on the old,

925
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,310
the guys watching on the screen,

926
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:47,921
and he said,

927
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,500
I don't want to get your money.

928
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,330
I'm going to put it on one number.

929
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,370
If it loses,

930
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,983
it loses.

931
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,100
If it wins,

932
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,240
the money's yours.

933
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,523
So the guy was like,

934
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,401
I need something.

935
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:01,020
They showed him the video of him,

936
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,820
hypnotize him and that he was his money.

937
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,280
Right.

938
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,810
So there's that.

939
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:08,040
So you've seen that and he's been stood
in the fucking spins and toughness fall

940
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,010
and doing all this stuff
leading up to it anyway,

941
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:11,970
when it comes to it,

942
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,260
gets it fucking wrong,

943
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,250
gets it fucking wrong.

944
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,450
And he gets every eat and then before
that he protected the lot of the numbers.

945
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,170
All six of them do.

946
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,180
I'm obviously,

947
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:25,290
he said that it was a trick.

948
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,360
I'll raise it at the end.

949
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:28,110
It was a little bit,

950
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,810
now it's a trek garbage truck.

951
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,061
Yeah.

952
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,200
That's why I love Penn and teller.

953
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:32,330
They tell you what the fuck the trends.

954
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:32,780
Yeah.

955
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:32,970
Yeah,

956
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,140
but down,

957
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:35,220
down by and leaves it.

958
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:36,740
So,

959
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,980
so with the lottery thing,

960
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:42,981
I like that because it's like that
shows when it comes to like lady luck,

961
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,630
well fuck you to do.

962
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:49,970
I mean do you not think you're
getting one over on lady luck,

963
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,273
slap you down.

964
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,460
That's the big issue that
people have with psychics.

965
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:54,600
Like if you really were psyche,

966
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:55,830
when you win every lottery,

967
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,723
like what are you doing?

968
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,370
He can make a lot of
money playing the lottery.

969
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,860
Imagine if you won the lottery like
every week and everybody be like,

970
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:02,730
Hey asshole,

971
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:03,840
the fuck are you doing?

972
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:03,991
Yeah.

973
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:04,471
Like dude,

974
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:05,090
I'm excited.

975
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,700
Yeah.

976
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,533
I wonder,

977
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,540
I wonder how many times we'd want it
before you got born than you do something

978
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:09,930
else.

979
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,141
Well,

980
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:13,710
Vegas won't let you win
that many times in a row.

981
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,580
Like Vegas.

982
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,840
We'll kick you out of casinos.

983
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,160
Even if you're not doing anything illegal.

984
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:17,994
Like David Cho,

985
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,890
he's been kicked out of casinos.

986
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,120
Like he's just too smart.

987
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:21,451
They're like,

988
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:22,171
you gotta get out here.

989
00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:25,860
You're fuck you thinking too much and
you've got a system and it works too.

990
00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:26,310
Well,

991
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,180
they won't say that to me.

992
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,310
They won't sell it to you
or say won't kick you out.

993
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,840
Why does that cause you to vague?

994
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,883
Nope.

995
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,390
Because I'm giving them lots of money.

996
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,770
You've given them lots of money.

997
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:34,901
Yeah,

998
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:35,430
because I'm,

999
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,410
because I started giving them them.

1000
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:37,850
Well,

1001
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,790
if you started winning,

1002
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,720
no man,

1003
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,140
no fucking deadline.

1004
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,421
But uh,

1005
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:44,220
you've had a gambling

1006
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,461
problem.

1007
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:45,300
That's what you're trying to say.

1008
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,293
Yeah.

1009
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:48,930
You know,

1010
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,990
that'd be trying to foam here.

1011
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,690
I've got my money to give you,

1012
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,291
fuck,

1013
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,580
I'm not finished leaves in.

1014
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,160
Why do you get crazy and gamble some much?

1015
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,421
I don't know.

1016
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:58,590
That's like a question.

1017
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,090
It's not question everyone asks us.

1018
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,420
No,

1019
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,253
no one else didn't.

1020
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,580
I think ask yourself,

1021
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,640
you know why?

1022
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:06,780
And I don't know that we've not,

1023
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,430
I'm not copping out here.

1024
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,730
I'm thinking maybe some part genetic
all my fault about the source.

1025
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,660
Yeah.

1026
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,050
But my,

1027
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,271
my,

1028
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:17,300
my father,

1029
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,273
my father,

1030
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,081
my dad,

1031
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:21,640
well my dad had a camber governor.

1032
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:22,200
No problem.

1033
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,670
Do you have a proper gambling problem?

1034
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:23,940
Yeah,

1035
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,191
yeah,

1036
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:24,480
yeah.

1037
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,910
Pauper Porsche gambling.

1038
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,940
So he was a,

1039
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,620
and you saw this when you were growing up,

1040
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:31,730
but,

1041
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:31,951
no,

1042
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:32,131
no,

1043
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:32,461
I never,

1044
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:33,330
I never met my dad.

1045
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,403
Oh yeah.

1046
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,140
The first time I never met him.

1047
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,063
I do know all,

1048
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,460
I never even fought by him
cause my mom was that good.

1049
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,090
Well that's amazing man.

1050
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:44,790
I'm fucking it when you think of it,

1051
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,490
because there's was a,

1052
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:49,800
you know,

1053
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
when she met my dad it was,

1054
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:53,020
um,

1055
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,280
you know,

1056
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,113
I was like,

1057
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,290
I remember,

1058
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,160
you know,

1059
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,601
timeline,

1060
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,110
we'll talk came over and uh,

1061
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,003
and this and that.

1062
00:27:59,150 --> 00:27:59,983
Um,

1063
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,150
because just want eight.

1064
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,150
You just cut out.

1065
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:04,830
I wanted that father figure I suppose.

1066
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,053
But um,

1067
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:07,970
yeah,

1068
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,270
what was the first time I found out?

1069
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:09,671
But that was,

1070
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:10,201
dad was,

1071
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:13,110
my mom came to the door
and you know that vein,

1072
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,063
which is polite.

1073
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,143
And um,

1074
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,193
then then,

1075
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,470
then I said to a,

1076
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:18,060
um,

1077
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,893
that she,

1078
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,000
that she said to me,

1079
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,400
because I didn't know
yet and she said to me,

1080
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,670
your Dad's dad and

1081
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,800
I'm not and that was it.

1082
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:29,940
Um,

1083
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,850
and then she told me about
the funeral and we went to,

1084
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,360
um,

1085
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,193
she picked me up,

1086
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,250
went to the funeral,

1087
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm having a coffee and she took talk
about it and then we were laughing after

1088
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:43,140
five minutes just because
there's nowhere really that sad.

1089
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:43,530
No,

1090
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,270
he didn't have a big place in your life.

1091
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,110
I'm sure I met,

1092
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:49,710
met him right when he had a
gambling problem is your point.

1093
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,550
Yeah.

1094
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,580
And so you feel like it's probably
genetic that you have one as well?

1095
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,450
Fuck it out.

1096
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,060
Fucking owl to dungeon.

1097
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:58,530
I felt we were fucking talking about,

1098
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:58,891
yeah,

1099
00:28:58,891 --> 00:28:59,910
we were talking about the gambling.

1100
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,670
So do you like,

1101
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,590
like what is it like you get in casinos
and you just can't help yourself.

1102
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,460
You just started playing card.

1103
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,210
What do you play?

1104
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,460
Blackjack and talk about the fucking yeah.

1105
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:11,100
Blackjack tattooed on your
arm going up in flames.

1106
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,030
Wow.

1107
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,430
And then I've got a
positive affirming message.

1108
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,443
What does it say?

1109
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,100
I'll find strength in pain.

1110
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:22,590
[inaudible] you got cards
on fire on your arm.

1111
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,720
I got some goofy tattoos too.

1112
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,554
It's okay.

1113
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,453
I don't think,

1114
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,790
I don't think of it as beef.

1115
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,220
Mine means waterfalls.

1116
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:29,940
Yeah.

1117
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,773
He thought it was

1118
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:32,440
forgotten.

1119
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,270
A woman friend who is learning
how to tattoo if you want to.

1120
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,470
If you're on a really awful,

1121
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,363
awful,

1122
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,600
what does that,

1123
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,880
I've got the serenity prayer.

1124
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,070
Well there's

1125
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,380
our,

1126
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,213
that's not funny.

1127
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,960
I think a,

1128
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,260
this is actually kind of interesting.

1129
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,500
They see the funny bit there.

1130
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,650
The dates.

1131
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:49,540
What crossed out the dates across.

1132
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:49,990
Crossed out.

1133
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,381
Yeah.

1134
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:50,690
Cause that,

1135
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,060
that was the last time we gambled.

1136
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,360
Gambled.

1137
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,750
Took what?

1138
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,580
The costs out.

1139
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,001
Oh Wow.

1140
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,610
And then you make another one and
then I'm gonna run out of room son.

1141
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:57,880
Yeah.

1142
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,151
Well,

1143
00:29:58,151 --> 00:29:58,300
I,

1144
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,640
well I did run out of it because,

1145
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,380
so every time you've gone you're wow.

1146
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,550
So that's your biggest issue is gambling.

1147
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,703
Oh,

1148
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,261
has this,

1149
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:08,420
uh,

1150
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,670
how,

1151
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,690
how long has this
existed for in your life?

1152
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,233
For years.

1153
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,193
Kindof five.

1154
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,320
Really?

1155
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,750
That's when he started
gambling like crazy.

1156
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,000
Yeah.

1157
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,710
Yeah.

1158
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,040
Well that's when I just,

1159
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,233
excuse me.

1160
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,790
Do you know that,

1161
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:23,360
um,

1162
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,020
there's,

1163
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,190
there's a study that recently came
out that said that there might be a

1164
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:29,600
connection between,

1165
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,140
uh,

1166
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,420
gambling addictions and brain damage.

1167
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,910
Is that yeah.

1168
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,230
And burn probably fucking good.

1169
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,860
Good tests come to that far.

1170
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,183
Yeah.

1171
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,750
He might be,

1172
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,583
man,

1173
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,350
I think he's sent in or something.

1174
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:46,741
No,

1175
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:47,790
I'm not hearing the same thing,

1176
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:48,630
but it was a,

1177
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:48,920
uh,

1178
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,420
a recent study I would have
to tell you about this.

1179
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:51,931
I mean,

1180
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:52,980
if I'd had known,

1181
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,821
but this,

1182
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:54,481
I'm actually,

1183
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:55,231
it wasn't that recent.

1184
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:56,400
It was like 2003,

1185
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,750
but that brain damage,

1186
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:59,250
that addictive behavior,

1187
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,440
they believe that there's a,

1188
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,700
there's a connection between guys
who have suffered him and impacts,

1189
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:07,440
and obviously you're very functional.

1190
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:10,020
It's not like I'm saying
that you got brain damage,

1191
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,080
but everybody's been hitting the head
has a certain amount of brain damage.

1192
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,130
I'm sure I have brain damage,

1193
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,111
but this,

1194
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:17,460
that this was a,

1195
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:20,280
a connection between that
and pathological gamblers.

1196
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,323
You know,

1197
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:21,970
that's a,

1198
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,370
that's a fascinating connection.

1199
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:23,661
Well,

1200
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:25,510
I started thinking God food,

1201
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:26,880
listening to your show all,

1202
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,740
all the time.

1203
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,170
Um,

1204
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:28,320
I,

1205
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,580
I'm having about the football players
and the kind of concussions and things

1206
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:32,210
like that.

1207
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:32,520
Um,

1208
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,940
even about the depression now,

1209
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,100
I was going through about being
for vague about depression.

1210
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,413
Um,

1211
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,350
I,

1212
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,680
I wanted it thought,

1213
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,110
been not touched how many times
getting concussions and such forth.

1214
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,520
I drug problems I've had.

1215
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,743
Um,

1216
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,890
I was,

1217
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,723
I was,

1218
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,010
I didn't pop in with Ghb,

1219
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,170
which is stuff that makes you sleep.

1220
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,190
Yeah.

1221
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,230
I had a problem with that and I,

1222
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,333
it's not,

1223
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,380
not excuses.

1224
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:00,690
It,

1225
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,523
um,

1226
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:01,940
you know,

1227
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,650
because it's smelt like,

1228
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:03,951
oh yeah,

1229
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:05,570
that's why I got not take loads.

1230
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,460
I've got shit defense and you know,

1231
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:07,641
my,

1232
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm not,

1233
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,930
not quick standup.

1234
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,153
Okay.

1235
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,780
But on top of that,

1236
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:16,700
taking that out and say it's a mental
attitude of not concentrate into training

1237
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,833
as an effect.

1238
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:18,991
Well,

1239
00:32:18,991 --> 00:32:19,561
did you,

1240
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:20,040
um,

1241
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,460
take,

1242
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,270
it seems like you took fighting like
less seriously then than you do now.

1243
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:25,590
When you,

1244
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,700
when you first started,

1245
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,860
did you not understand the consequences?

1246
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:29,280
Was it,

1247
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,230
was it a matter of that
and how is it a matter of,

1248
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:34,290
it just became like something
where you just really decided,

1249
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,000
I got to get dedicated if
I want to keep doing this.

1250
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:36,360
I took

1251
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,193
it seriously.

1252
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,253
I like,

1253
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,850
I it on your way to do it.

1254
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,050
I went to Mitchell,

1255
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,460
just jumped right in the prime cause that,

1256
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,650
well because it was
just the way it was the,

1257
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,380
I've been thinking about this now to me.

1258
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,400
I went,

1259
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,230
I saw it,

1260
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,080
I can do that.

1261
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,830
I did it right.

1262
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,830
I kind of believed it and I saw the
fight in and I saw nog and I fought.

1263
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,790
I'm not too far off after his
fucking unbelievably fucking naive.

1264
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,320
And then I went in on,

1265
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07,190
I had my first fight,

1266
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,360
I could do it and I thought,

1267
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:08,690
yeah,

1268
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:08,931
okay,

1269
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:09,764
I can do this.

1270
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,843
Um,

1271
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,700
and then 10 shows later,

1272
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,571
I mean,

1273
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:19,280
the main event against done seven loads
of people are fucking watching me and

1274
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,114
I'm,

1275
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,680
I'm just,

1276
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,490
I'm out and a new way at the time.

1277
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,190
A lot of time going to the first event.

1278
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,470
I said to my girlfriend at the time,

1279
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,210
I'll be main event and I'm not like that,

1280
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,290
but I said it and I just knew it until,

1281
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,490
because I believed it
happened because I made it up.

1282
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,960
But also because you're
gigantic and you worked out.

1283
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,441
Oh yeah.

1284
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:43,071
That made it happen.

1285
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:43,510
Nobody.

1286
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,343
Okay.

1287
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,700
There's like a few,

1288
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:46,534
uh,

1289
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,413
didn't work out.

1290
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,300
Don't know.

1291
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,590
I,

1292
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:48,960
I,

1293
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,070
I was working out because
I was training to,

1294
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,510
so I was trying to hard
for if that's right,

1295
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,450
but um,

1296
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,580
I have in them before,

1297
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:57,020
so I was relatively fit,

1298
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:57,580
but no,

1299
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,131
but that's the,

1300
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:01,160
you mean you jumped into the
deep end of the pool right away?

1301
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,521
Yeah,

1302
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:01,791
I did.

1303
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:01,971
Yeah.

1304
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:02,491
That's pretty,

1305
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:02,781
I mean,

1306
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:07,781
you fought Alexander Emelianenko who's
a high level MMA heavyweight within how

1307
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:09,681
many months of use?

1308
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,360
Beginning training and striking,

1309
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,443
uh,

1310
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,760
fight for about a year.

1311
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,690
Just over a year.

1312
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:15,524
So,

1313
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,240
but I wasn't training,

1314
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,500
I didn't have a team that I was telling
him the little dove or that and it was

1315
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:22,334
all a bit,

1316
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,120
that's what they said.

1317
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,953
What happens then?

1318
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,461
You know,

1319
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:24,710
you know,

1320
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,630
you go and get little chills right now.

1321
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:26,931
I'm ready.

1322
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:27,520
I know.

1323
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,030
And I remember watching him and I and Co
and it looked like on a video and just

1324
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:34,160
like not in the flesh again.

1325
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:34,881
Yeah.

1326
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:35,570
Okay.

1327
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,021
Oh Shit.

1328
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:36,380
Myself,

1329
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:36,681
I was like,

1330
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:36,801
yeah,

1331
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:37,634
I can do this.

1332
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,480
Okay,

1333
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,313
okay,

1334
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,543
I can do that.

1335
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,870
That was a crazy fight,

1336
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,200
dude.

1337
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,950
Okay.

1338
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:43,790
That was a crazy fight.

1339
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,100
You just charge after that.

1340
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,540
But what you saw though
was me being serious as it.

1341
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,120
So to me that was authentic rage.

1342
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,790
That wasn't obviously my video.

1343
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,980
I explain it and

1344
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,800
we'll make a lot of videos now.

1345
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:01,030
And you're,

1346
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,410
yeah,

1347
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,080
I'm loving to hell.

1348
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,560
Blogs and stuff and putting them online.

1349
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:04,610
No,

1350
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:04,791
I've,

1351
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:05,601
I've really enjoyed it.

1352
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:05,761
I've,

1353
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:06,561
I've been lucky enough,

1354
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:06,891
I've got,

1355
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:07,724
um,

1356
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,410
um,

1357
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:08,870
I,

1358
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,230
um,

1359
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,831
I met Guy,

1360
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:10,664
I'm sigh,

1361
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,670
it's like Paris and he
dive accent does a film.

1362
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,380
I told him about a few ideas.

1363
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,960
He came down,

1364
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,890
started doing these,

1365
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,010
putting these ideas into play and yeah,

1366
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:22,910
it's going really well.

1367
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,073
That's cool man.

1368
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,150
So this um,

1369
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,900
this colossal concerns,

1370
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:27,890
things that you're doing,

1371
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:30,800
all these videos and the blogs and
everything and it seems like you're really

1372
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:31,551
excited about this.

1373
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:32,960
Like you constantly tweeting,

1374
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,950
tell everybody or we retweet
shit pending the asthma.

1375
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,530
It little bit of pain in the ass about it.

1376
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,610
But I appreciate

1377
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,030
the,

1378
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,211
the,

1379
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:40,230
I like what you're doing.

1380
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:43,610
I like very enthusiastic
about that 12 take,

1381
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,513
I'll take,

1382
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,780
that's a bit annoying,

1383
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,760
but then it doesn't annoy me.

1384
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,120
No,

1385
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,320
but it annoys other people.

1386
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,333
I don't mind.

1387
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:51,671
It doesn't bother me.

1388
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:52,504
I just get scared.

1389
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,390
I'm trying to make me scared.

1390
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,370
I told him I'll pay,

1391
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:57,870
people are asking me to retweet shit.

1392
00:35:57,871 --> 00:35:58,680
It's normal for me.

1393
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:58,840
Yeah,

1394
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,050
yeah,

1395
00:35:59,050 --> 00:35:59,883
yeah.

1396
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,020
That's the thing.

1397
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,690
Like I think the,

1398
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,210
in the future that's what will be the red.

1399
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,203
Um,

1400
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,590
that's what he said in the,

1401
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,410
in the future it'll be
likes will be currency.

1402
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,170
Currency.

1403
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,003
I used trig.

1404
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,580
Yeah.

1405
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,230
I really think that that would
be the best way to live the life.

1406
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,310
Live world,

1407
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:20,910
the world.

1408
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,510
You know,

1409
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,820
if you could actually
work it out that way.

1410
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:27,630
So like being nice and helping people
would give you the most currency,

1411
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,420
that would be the most beautiful.

1412
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,890
But what about the simple,

1413
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,710
no,

1414
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,541
can't be that simple.

1415
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,430
We're not living in a garden.

1416
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,320
Know I've seen people who
loved hot kit that people,

1417
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,220
they'd be,

1418
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,860
they'd be all that kind of
fucking bullshit going on.

1419
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,750
Wacky coder or son of a bitch would get
in there and exert his intelligence,

1420
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,220
troll dominance over that computer and
fucking whack it out and have a billion

1421
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:51,054
likes.

1422
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,710
You have more likes than there are people.

1423
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,230
Every one socket I cracked the code bed.

1424
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,470
Yeah,

1425
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,001
that's a,

1426
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:03,450
it's a,

1427
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,680
that's a beautiful idea.

1428
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,760
But they've got to figure out something
better than letting old people just keep

1429
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:11,670
it and make everybody else
paying interest on it.

1430
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:13,650
And the Federal Bank and all this,

1431
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,290
you see all these big giant banks.

1432
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:20,280
It's supposedly control these different
aspects of our political systems,

1433
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,114
yours and ours.

1434
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,871
Did you see the,

1435
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:22,350
um,

1436
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:22,670
let me go,

1437
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,650
what off of the federal reserves,

1438
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,860
like a partial bit of it got printed
and it was trillions of dollars.

1439
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,890
Trillions going to
different bunks all over.

1440
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,821
I see what you're saying.

1441
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:36,050
Yeah.

1442
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,440
The secret hidden,

1443
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:37,800
uh,

1444
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,470
bail outs that we didn't know
about millions of dollars.

1445
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,790
He's a crazy,

1446
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,303
it's,

1447
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
it's robbery right in front of your face.

1448
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,870
She belt on my fall.

1449
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,590
Trillions.

1450
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,640
What do you get back?

1451
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:55,140
Justifiable robbery.

1452
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,861
That's what it is.

1453
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:56,760
They figured out how to,

1454
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,350
how to like Jack,

1455
00:37:58,351 --> 00:37:59,220
this system,

1456
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,400
how to extract insane amounts of cash,

1457
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,950
have to have these
mansions in the Hamptons.

1458
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:05,790
They figured it out.

1459
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,301
Okay.

1460
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:07,134
You can't be hating.

1461
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,750
They can get a throw your system away.

1462
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,280
It's infested with rats.

1463
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:12,870
The system doesn't work at all,

1464
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,190
but no one's willing to do that.

1465
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,990
No one is willing to start from zero.

1466
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,420
If you worked your whole life
and you get 50 grand in the bank,

1467
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,830
you're not going to give that 50 grand up.

1468
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,410
And neither is the guy who's
got $1 million in the bank.

1469
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:23,850
He's not going to give
that million dollars.

1470
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,220
Well,

1471
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,770
and we're all going to start at zero.

1472
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,270
I felt fuck Outta here.

1473
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,104
I don't know.

1474
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,230
I wouldn't cause there's a lot of assholes
out there that shouldn't even be a

1475
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,621
zero.

1476
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:32,730
They should be like a negative.

1477
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:35,350
So fucking Lazy Bitches,

1478
00:38:35,351 --> 00:38:35,711
right?

1479
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:36,070
There's a lot

1480
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,780
of people that don't
contribute their share.

1481
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,440
So unfortunately capitalism as,

1482
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:42,840
as it stands right now as well,

1483
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,760
we got no one was called
where a good alternative.

1484
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,541
Well we need to,

1485
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:50,980
it's really silly because in
2013 the idea that this is,

1486
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,980
and I'm not a socialist by any
stretch of the imagination,

1487
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:54,241
I,

1488
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:54,561
I'm,

1489
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:55,600
I'm more of a,

1490
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:58,000
I think people need to pull their
own weight and a lot of people don't.

1491
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,250
I think there's a lot
of lazy fucks out there.

1492
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,360
There's a lot of people that just,

1493
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,310
they lack motivation,

1494
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:04,270
they lack direction,

1495
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:05,081
they lack focus,

1496
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,520
they self sabotage.

1497
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:07,930
And he shouldn't reward that.

1498
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,160
I don't think you should reward that.

1499
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,600
But on the other hand,

1500
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,210
this system is fucking crazy.

1501
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:14,770
This stock market,

1502
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:14,901
we,

1503
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:19,901
you're gambling on the ups and downs
of Konya owning pieces of companies got

1504
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:20,391
though,

1505
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,330
but fuck no one even knows what it is.

1506
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,583
The nuts

1507
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,913
and stuff.

1508
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,980
I've had friends that are stockbrokers
try to explain to me derivatives and I'm

1509
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:30,814
like,

1510
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,320
I wasn't that legal.

1511
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:33,490
How is any of this legal,

1512
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,260
how was shorting legal?

1513
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,110
How is how our lobbyists legal?

1514
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:38,681
It's like,

1515
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:41,230
it's a fucking cookie system.

1516
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,251
And you're like,

1517
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:44,170
well someone should really
come in and overhaul it,

1518
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:45,220
but they'll,

1519
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,210
in order to do that,

1520
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,141
he's homeless.

1521
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:48,230
Like they,

1522
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,400
they must know but it can't keep going on.

1523
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,230
Seems like he's that on purpose.

1524
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:55,810
Like it's an old car that
they keep trying to patch up.

1525
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,160
That's what I think.

1526
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,431
You know,

1527
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:01,000
if you had like a 1950 fucking Chevrolet,

1528
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,770
those are boring to drive.

1529
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:04,780
They sucked those old fucking cars,

1530
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:05,350
man.

1531
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,340
If you got to get on the highway
every day and trends go from uh,

1532
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,641
you know,

1533
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:14,641
like a w say Sherman oaks to downtown La.

1534
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,130
You had to make that drive every day and
the heat in a model t you would fucking

1535
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:18,550
hate it.

1536
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,250
You'd go crazy because
it's an old piece of shit.

1537
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,330
No matter what you do,

1538
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:24,280
whether you add a new stereo to it,

1539
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:26,590
are you fucking put shiny rims on it.

1540
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,240
It's designed like shit.

1541
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,590
It's an old piece of shit.

1542
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,930
You don't want to have to
drive an old piece of shit.

1543
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:32,764
If I give you a,

1544
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,030
a Nice Honda accord,

1545
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:34,390
you'd be like,

1546
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,080
ah,

1547
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,980
look at this.

1548
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:41,190
It's quiet and conditions doesn't fall
when I turned the wheel doesn't fall on

1549
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:43,264
its side.

1550
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,051
Those old cars,

1551
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:47,260
we're pieces of shit
and that's our system.

1552
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:51,670
Our system is old piece of shit
and we haven't thrown it out yet.

1553
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:56,380
We haven't just like fucking grabbed it
and yanked the gears out and melted it

1554
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:57,940
all down and made a new system.

1555
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,440
If someone comes up with something,

1556
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,600
which I'll never let them.

1557
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,493
Yeah,

1558
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,520
yeah.

1559
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,353
Well that's it.

1560
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:04,781
Well,

1561
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:04,931
it's,

1562
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:05,321
it's a,

1563
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:07,390
it's a thinly disguised

1564
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,360
king and,

1565
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,180
and,

1566
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,970
and disciple situation.

1567
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,110
It's a thinly disguised the,

1568
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,301
the,

1569
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:18,310
the people that are in
the position of power.

1570
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:19,180
It's not just one,

1571
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:22,840
but it's a group that are unquestionably
the kings of this country.

1572
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:23,770
But Pete,

1573
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,910
but he's changing isn't it?

1574
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,820
I think with the Internet where
people get more knowledge,

1575
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,121
you know,

1576
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:30,820
it's fellow food a lot more well off,

1577
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,390
you know,

1578
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,223
on,

1579
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,010
oh what are

1580
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
you doing dude?

1581
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,680
I think with the people
that are in charge of it,

1582
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,370
it's,

1583
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,540
it's the only thing that's changing is
if it's out in the open and then people

1584
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:50,330
are just accepting it
now with full knowledge.

1585
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:53,840
Like when you see that
people can have like,

1586
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,400
do you know anything about this?

1587
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:57,050
I'm fast and furious.

1588
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:57,920
Do you know what happened?

1589
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,580
You hear about the gums

1590
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,000
in Mexico?

1591
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,480
Yeah,

1592
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,970
well there's a thing called
the executive privilege.

1593
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,211
You know,

1594
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:07,880
like this is the president could say
he doesn't want to talk about it.

1595
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,700
So they can just say,

1596
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,541
second,

1597
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:14,510
it looks like I'm not testifying.

1598
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:15,960
Why?

1599
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,570
Why not?

1600
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,180
That's crazy.

1601
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,400
Why not testify together?

1602
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,010
What's the big deal?

1603
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:19,671
And then wine look,

1604
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:22,250
soul fucking shifty about it.

1605
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,030
Did you see that?

1606
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,863
Yeah.

1607
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,723
I mean looked.

1608
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,340
I mean,

1609
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,150
you can't say,

1610
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,320
yeah,

1611
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,670
I'm fucking,

1612
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,530
he fly in.

1613
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,423
They,

1614
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,030
if they didn't know that
something was gonna happen,

1615
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,420
they absolutely did profit on
the fact that it did happen.

1616
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,020
Yeah.

1617
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,780
You know,

1618
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,410
oh,

1619
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,930
well you can't,

1620
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,250
you can't die.

1621
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,173
You can't do it.

1622
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:44,180
It's the most obvious connected
John's paper trail ever.

1623
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,810
If you look at like Dick Cheney
was the head of Halliburton.

1624
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,960
Halliburton is accompany
that rebuilds countries,

1625
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,780
Africa and that company,

1626
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,250
the CEO is the vice president and all of
a sudden that companies making billions

1627
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:58,251
of dollars,

1628
00:42:58,251 --> 00:42:58,401
like,

1629
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:00,050
what are you talking about?

1630
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:00,860
That's,

1631
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,710
I wonder if maybe they knew
about it and maybe even how.

1632
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,593
Tell me a little bit,

1633
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,040
I don't know.

1634
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,170
Then that way I'll maybe have a team
what do this and they don't really tell

1635
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:12,570
them what they're doing in and what
it's for and you'd get the decide,

1636
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,900
reflect without everyone knowing
what the fuck's going on.

1637
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,630
I would like to tell you
that that's not possible.

1638
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,640
That there's no one who'd
be willing to do that.

1639
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,270
But the problem with saying
that is that the only,

1640
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:24,560
the only real issue,

1641
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,940
only real issue with someone would have
about our government doing that would be

1642
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,900
that it's sacrificing American lives and
that they would kill American lives and

1643
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:33,800
let American people die.

1644
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:34,071
No,

1645
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,180
they're here to protect us.

1646
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,520
So that's the one thing that
some people would hold back.

1647
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,820
But what they will undeniably would all
agree to is that we don't really have a

1648
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:45,350
problem with killing
people and other countries.

1649
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,020
We don't really have a problem
if we decide that they're,

1650
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:52,910
the enemy will kill you with robots
that fly from the sky and shoot rockets

1651
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,440
indiscriminately into villages.

1652
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,070
Okay.

1653
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,030
That's how it will kill you.

1654
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,170
So the,

1655
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,960
a company that's willing to do
that would just say a company,

1656
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,550
let's call it a company
instead of a country.

1657
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,990
Cause it's not really the whole con,

1658
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,760
it's not us.

1659
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:03,960
It's,

1660
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,020
it's whoever the fuck is the one who
gets to pull the buttons and pull the

1661
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:07,431
switches.

1662
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:09,260
But that's why I think
they're willing to do that.

1663
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:09,861
I don't forget,

1664
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:10,220
can I,

1665
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,130
that's why I don't think he can continue.

1666
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,450
Like you said that he wove know
people are just known about it.

1667
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,284
I'm doing nothing.

1668
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,500
I think eventually the,

1669
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,840
that just knowing about it,

1670
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,370
I think the next stage is,

1671
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:24,590
then we'll know that's why the
almond milk it can to keep going.

1672
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,880
I think the problem is that
it's very hard to stop and the,

1673
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,650
in fairness to the people
that are in military,

1674
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:32,160
there's a lot

1675
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,700
of them that joined the military with
very good intentions and they get into

1676
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:40,701
that position and they're stuck
in a battle and it's not them.

1677
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,510
That's the problem.

1678
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,380
It's the,

1679
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:43,571
the,

1680
00:44:43,571 --> 00:44:46,860
the problem is why would they
sent there in the first place?

1681
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,300
Go once you're in,

1682
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,120
once you're in for
everyone who's a soldier,

1683
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,110
you know what it becomes,

1684
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:52,680
man.

1685
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,900
It becomes taking care of your friends.

1686
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,270
That's what it comes.

1687
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,740
It becomes taking care of your boys,

1688
00:44:58,741 --> 00:44:59,710
taking care of,

1689
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:00,511
of your girls,

1690
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:01,920
taking care of the people you love.

1691
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,500
Those are the people you're
with every day in a war zone.

1692
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,360
So it doesn't become about the,

1693
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:07,440
your ideology,

1694
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:09,000
whether or not you believe in this war,

1695
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,730
it becomes not just a battle.

1696
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,270
I mean,

1697
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,550
and there's no way around that.

1698
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,760
I was talking to my,

1699
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:15,570
um,

1700
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,400
my friend who's in the army,

1701
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,140
um,

1702
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,240
I,

1703
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,660
you know,

1704
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:18,941
we were,

1705
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:19,561
we would talk,

1706
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:21,780
he's in the marines and
I was saying to him,

1707
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,183
you know,

1708
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,930
we just having a general discussion
about a fuck to is about this and that,

1709
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,410
um,

1710
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:28,860
you know,

1711
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,810
basically doing the government's work.

1712
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,673
Yeah.

1713
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,070
I mean,

1714
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:32,910
and he said to me,

1715
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,213
um,

1716
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,490
you know,

1717
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,990
each all basically I off,

1718
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,680
I always think I've got
got back cause I make,

1719
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:42,270
so I make sure they're okay.

1720
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,583
I love on,

1721
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,820
I never fall of it like that.

1722
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,350
He always has to go back and think
about his friend says to always,

1723
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:48,810
yeah,

1724
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,360
because they've been told that bomb gear,

1725
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,091
you're fucking,

1726
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:52,410
bullets are whizzing by you.

1727
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:52,690
You're,

1728
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:53,820
you're carrying each other.

1729
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:54,750
Sometimes you know,

1730
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,001
you're,

1731
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:56,160
you're looking out for each other.

1732
00:45:56,161 --> 00:45:57,060
You're in a war zone.

1733
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,140
That's what it becomes.

1734
00:45:58,141 --> 00:45:59,480
And so the,

1735
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,900
the real issue is,

1736
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,141
well,

1737
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,360
how do you stop the whole thing?

1738
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,620
How do you stop the whole thing?

1739
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:07,860
Cause I don't know if you do because
you do a lot of God damn damage.

1740
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,860
And then people that you did that damage
to are always going to want to come

1741
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:11,440
back at you.

1742
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:11,870
Yeah,

1743
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,910
there's no doubt about it and there's
no doubt that this damage has been done.

1744
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,650
So it's not an easy thing to step in
and sort of settle the world down.

1745
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,680
But I do agree with you that the Internet
is changing it to the point where that

1746
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:26,970
is the inevitable future.

1747
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:31,720
I think the realization of what everyone's
actions are actually accomplishing it

1748
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,920
and actually doing and
what to what detriment.

1749
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,401
You know,

1750
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:36,560
our actions or two,

1751
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:41,310
it's going to get to a point where things
level out much more so than they ever

1752
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:45,210
have in the past because governments
could do anything behind your back.

1753
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:45,671
They could do,

1754
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:50,040
do all kinds of sneaky shit and you can
never know about it ever until 50 60

1755
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:50,820
years ago,

1756
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,151
you know?

1757
00:46:51,151 --> 00:46:53,100
And then it's then people
started leaking information.

1758
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,210
It's like the Kennedy Times.

1759
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,073
That's when people say,

1760
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,130
I mean before that.

1761
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:57,600
I mean God damn.

1762
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:01,410
How's the average person get information
that there's corruption going on in

1763
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:01,921
society?

1764
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:03,210
How does the average person get that?

1765
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,950
You're not getting a lot of it,

1766
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,080
but you're getting so much of it now.

1767
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:11,490
It's like every day on Twitter and every
damn Facebook and everyday people are

1768
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:15,960
emailing people links Twitter and shit
to their friends and it just gets to a

1769
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,840
mad frenzy of ideas now too.

1770
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:22,440
I don't even think we're
aware of how strange it is.

1771
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:26,340
I think we're just used to it because
we're in it and this is our life now,

1772
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,950
but I think if we looked at life today,

1773
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,440
a few decades ago,

1774
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:30,891
we would go,

1775
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:32,390
this is crazy.

1776
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,030
This is a fucking science
fiction movie with you.

1777
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:36,800
Freaks came in,

1778
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,410
came in early on a,

1779
00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:40,250
I was talking to Brian,

1780
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:40,770
I'm,

1781
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,310
and he showed me some
little fucking video,

1782
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,320
like it's seven second line.

1783
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,410
He was like the finger finger.

1784
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,053
Look Dude,

1785
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,890
I'm an shows.

1786
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,000
Shows a little film.

1787
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,200
I'm upside the next thing of than
Twitter or like a video message.

1788
00:47:57,201 --> 00:47:57,351
What?

1789
00:47:57,351 --> 00:47:58,310
Lost seven seconds.

1790
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:01,730
So it's a video message for the last
seven times it was called vine and Brian's

1791
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:05,600
got into it and the apparently a
lot of people like this silly shit.

1792
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:07,760
Now look it up.

1793
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,123
That's what I'm talking about.

1794
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:10,900
And did you,

1795
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,720
did you splice all this together yourself?

1796
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,130
Does it automatically like it's literally
like you just push a button every time

1797
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:19,230
you went to record and we don't push it.

1798
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,540
It's just pauses the
recording and it just,

1799
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,920
it makes the animated Gif on plot.

1800
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,780
You just smash them all together yourself.

1801
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,090
Yeah,

1802
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:25,980
just does it automatically.

1803
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,940
Oh that's cool.

1804
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:27,923
And you're like,

1805
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,610
oh I'm going to start using that shit.

1806
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,331
It's fun man.

1807
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:31,230
It's really addicting.

1808
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,760
Everybody lasts but the cause crazy.

1809
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,250
Everywhere you look people
are vining and so it just,

1810
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,160
a bunch of people like walking
around like this in the air.

1811
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,710
It's cause it vine.com no,

1812
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:41,790
it's an APP on your iPhone.

1813
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:42,710
Oh it's an athlete.

1814
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:42,841
Yeah.

1815
00:48:42,841 --> 00:48:44,790
And it should be coming
out on [inaudible] soon.

1816
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:47,070
Twitter just bought it cause
it link up with Twitter.

1817
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,490
Yeah.

1818
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,323
Oh power.

1819
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,750
And you can also also send it
to Facebook and everything,

1820
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:53,130
but it's really fun.

1821
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:54,390
What can I keep my Twitter name?

1822
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:55,980
Do I have to register a new name?

1823
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,970
I think it's a,

1824
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:57,210
yeah,

1825
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,260
you can keep your Twitter name,

1826
00:48:58,261 --> 00:49:02,820
but it's also really weird because I
think you can just have a million names.

1827
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:03,121
Oh,

1828
00:49:03,121 --> 00:49:03,781
that's great.

1829
00:49:03,781 --> 00:49:04,614
Yeah,

1830
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,840
a lot of assholes.

1831
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,440
It's really hard to find people as soon
as you allow people to be anonymous.

1832
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,281
In the latter.

1833
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,440
We have a bunch of different names.

1834
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:12,920
I'm going to have
conversations with themselves.

1835
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,690
We had a guy on our
message board wants that.

1836
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:15,710
They busted doing that.

1837
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,390
He had more than one account and
he was like talking to the cool,

1838
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,510
like on message boards it would go
and like make some a post about his,

1839
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,610
his music and then come back and say,

1840
00:49:25,611 --> 00:49:25,821
hey,

1841
00:49:25,821 --> 00:49:26,391
thanks man.

1842
00:49:26,391 --> 00:49:27,280
I really appreciate that.

1843
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:29,780
Uh,

1844
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,310
so about the art came aim.

1845
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,310
It's classic.

1846
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,450
It's hilarious.

1847
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,700
What did you do today?

1848
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:38,181
Oh,

1849
00:49:38,181 --> 00:49:39,014
you know,

1850
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,550
talk to myself.

1851
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,140
But it's kind of funny because it's,

1852
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,820
is that any different than some bullshit
commercial their company puts out?

1853
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,800
You know where you,

1854
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,141
you know,

1855
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:49,610
you drive down the street and like,

1856
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:54,350
I'm so glad that we're here driving on
these Goodyear tires because they make me

1857
00:49:54,351 --> 00:49:55,400
feel secure,

1858
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,060
tore shit to projected out you,

1859
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:02,630
you're not going out and doing it.

1860
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,010
I guess it's like,

1861
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,540
it's more deceitful.

1862
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,810
It's more boards will cringe fucking word.

1863
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,280
Oh fuck.

1864
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,681
Oh fuck you.

1865
00:50:12,681 --> 00:50:13,260
I have this whole,

1866
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,410
don't y'all get

1867
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,640
the fuck am I doing?

1868
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:23,030
If you're just pissed off
that one time could you just,

1869
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,790
and when I'm stupid
moods and that came out,

1870
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:27,403
it done.

1871
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,980
You can't do

1872
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,600
that in a away.

1873
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,111
Yeah.

1874
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:31,370
You get to take your lumps.

1875
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,110
That's a tough one because people are
just not going to trust you again.

1876
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,690
You know they were talking,

1877
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,930
we were talking yesterday with my
friend Sam Sherida about this author,

1878
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,920
I forget the guy's name,

1879
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:43,754
but he,

1880
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,660
he made up a bunch of Bob Dylan quotes
and apparently it was like a great

1881
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:48,440
author,

1882
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,180
but he made up these quotes and then when
they like tried to check him on it and

1883
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:55,460
tried to like find the
source of these quotes,

1884
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,500
he like got arrogant about it.

1885
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:00,440
And then they started researching
it and they wouldn't let it go.

1886
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:03,300
And they apparently they found that he
just made them up to point and he's bald.

1887
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:04,370
He could,

1888
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:04,671
he could,

1889
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:05,100
right?

1890
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:05,360
Yeah.

1891
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,193
Whatever you want it.

1892
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,213
Yeah,

1893
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:08,301
sure.

1894
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:08,481
Yeah.

1895
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:12,260
You could put a Bob Dylan quote and say
some of the most poignant things at Bob

1896
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,160
Evans was thinking this at
the time when Bob said this,

1897
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:21,161
it spoke to my soul because I a child
who's been in the 60s I was on Haight

1898
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:21,620
Ashbury.

1899
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,220
I was,

1900
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,030
I was wearing a Bandana
with live flowers in it.

1901
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,340
The fucking freaks.

1902
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:29,571
Yeah.

1903
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:31,400
So this guy just ruined them,

1904
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,180
ruined them.

1905
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,590
So I think like this other guy,

1906
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,460
it's kind of similar.

1907
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,540
It's like no one's gonna really take you
seriously know he felt it lets you go

1908
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:39,700
do io Oscar or something.

1909
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,850
You're going to go to Peru.

1910
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,440
You gotta prove yourself Fitch
man does coat two minute.

1911
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,790
I've seen Mendez character,

1912
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,220
the follow stele jokes.

1913
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:50,054
Dealer character.

1914
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:56,290
Farlow the drug dealer character diva

1915
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,000
fucking jokes.

1916
00:51:59,001 --> 00:51:59,480
Taylor.

1917
00:51:59,480 --> 00:51:59,830
Oh,

1918
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,310
Joe Sia.

1919
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,353
Carla.

1920
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:04,610
I don't know.

1921
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:04,911
I don't know.

1922
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:05,631
It's hard to understand.

1923
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:06,464
You

1924
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,380
don't quite know what
the fuck you been saying.

1925
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,830
We do have a bit of an accent,

1926
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:16,570
my friend.

1927
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:16,860
Oh,

1928
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,490
fucking hell.

1929
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:17,720
Very.

1930
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,231
It's funny,

1931
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:20,690
like I remember a certain guys like Terry,

1932
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:21,080
Adam,

1933
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,130
Terry Adams got a very,

1934
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:23,690
very strong accent.

1935
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,260
Like he talks to you like,

1936
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:25,880
Woo,

1937
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,170
I don't want to put that together.

1938
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,090
I don't know why Hitler England,

1939
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,020
um,

1940
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:30,770
Michael Bisping.

1941
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:31,131
Yeah.

1942
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:31,850
There's so many.

1943
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:32,683
I don't know why England.

1944
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,070
It's a small place,

1945
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:35,750
right on the,

1946
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:37,160
so many different accents,

1947
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,151
line of access,

1948
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:40,520
but a lot of it's a very strong accent.

1949
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:41,000
You know,

1950
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,870
it's interesting.

1951
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,890
And uh,

1952
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:43,270
it's the,

1953
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,103
the accent,

1954
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:44,240
it's,

1955
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,730
it's very fitting for the
people that live in England.

1956
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:47,660
Walk.

1957
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,470
Do you mean because they
have to be tough because,

1958
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,120
oh shit,

1959
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,601
I've got a bit,

1960
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:51,640
this is a

1961
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,530
different place,

1962
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:54,951
you know,

1963
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:55,750
and the,

1964
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,583
the fact that guys,

1965
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,090
it's fucking different,

1966
00:52:59,091 --> 00:52:59,924
man.

1967
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,250
It human beings.

1968
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:04,450
We look at the whole world and we,

1969
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,950
we like to think that it's just like,

1970
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,150
it is here,

1971
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,073
but it's over there.

1972
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,010
We think like,

1973
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:10,461
you know,

1974
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:11,630
live in Africa,

1975
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:12,860
live in Saudi Arabia,

1976
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:13,600
whatever,

1977
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,180
man.

1978
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,530
As long as we're there together,

1979
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:16,250
it'll be like,

1980
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:16,611
you know,

1981
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:17,361
it'd be like us.

1982
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:17,950
He,

1983
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:18,400
no,

1984
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:18,720
that's,

1985
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,580
that's not the case.

1986
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:20,331
You go to England,

1987
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:20,570
you know,

1988
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,860
well this is a different world.

1989
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,590
These guys have completely
different expectations.

1990
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,980
They drive it on the lefthand

1991
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,610
side.

1992
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,650
They don't give a fuck about you more.

1993
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:29,431
You're crazy.

1994
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:30,121
Laws are,

1995
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:31,780
your quarters don't mean shit there.

1996
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:32,623
They're not real.

1997
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,091
You know,

1998
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:33,451
it's like,

1999
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:33,751
wow,

2000
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,390
this is a totally different
place with their own money.

2001
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,373
And like,

2002
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:38,071
you know,

2003
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:40,190
you'll see people on TV that
are important and you're like,

2004
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:41,100
who the fuck is that guy?

2005
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:43,200
You have no idea who
their prime minister is.

2006
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:44,610
I have no idea who any
of these people are.

2007
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:44,981
You know,

2008
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:49,981
you hear like Margaret Margaret
Thatcher every now and then we know her,

2009
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:52,560
we know the prints.

2010
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:53,580
We know that like,

2011
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:53,680
well,

2012
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,020
we'll follow your royal family,

2013
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:56,880
but I don't know what
the fuck is going on.

2014
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:57,460
You know?

2015
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:57,811
So it's,

2016
00:53:57,811 --> 00:53:59,160
it's fascinating to be over.

2017
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,070
It's a totally different world.

2018
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,580
You know,

2019
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,510
England is,

2020
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,410
it's first of all,

2021
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,300
it's kind of a massive amount of history.

2022
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,190
There's so much history in England.

2023
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,630
There's so many years.

2024
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,201
Many,

2025
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:10,730
many.

2026
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,750
Like if you look at the
history of the United States,

2027
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:14,880
you're only dealing with
like 200 plus years,

2028
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:15,760
but England,

2029
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,021
you're like,

2030
00:54:16,021 --> 00:54:16,561
Jesus Christ,

2031
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:21,090
you guys go back over a thousand so it's
like you have some really old pubs that

2032
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,180
have been open since like
the 14 hundreds right?

2033
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,014
Aren't there

2034
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,680
some real real fucking oh shit.

2035
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:30,590
And England we called Shit.

2036
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,860
Oh Shit.

2037
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,713
Oh Shit.

2038
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,781
Go to a pub.

2039
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:34,860
Stop and think about that.

2040
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:37,920
That's been open since the 14 hundreds

2041
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,070
I'm spelled the same.

2042
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,270
Fuck man,

2043
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,440
ain't biomed.

2044
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,740
How did you guys deal with,

2045
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:45,210
you know,

2046
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:47,610
you have kings and Queens
still while you lease,

2047
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,870
you have acquainted but you don't really,

2048
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,250
they don't really get
to tell you what to do.

2049
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:50,820
Well,

2050
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,960
it's a different situation.

2051
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,530
It's like,

2052
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,800
it's almost like they're like
actors playing the queen.

2053
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,610
Yeah,

2054
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,210
slightly.

2055
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,043
The

2056
00:54:58,890 --> 00:54:59,401
other deal,

2057
00:54:59,401 --> 00:55:00,360
I'm the captain a lot,

2058
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,253
you know,

2059
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:02,933
you just,

2060
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,840
they'd give him money and they make
them look bad ass and they wave.

2061
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,280
They do like that and they just
show the most proper behavior.

2062
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,240
And then if they don't,

2063
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,560
you know what I mean?

2064
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,600
That's why the public,

2065
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:18,240
the queen gets all pissed off because
we could lose half fucking money.

2066
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:18,511
Yeah,

2067
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:20,610
you can lose that Gig context.

2068
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:21,500
Fucking fight.

2069
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,480
You got to act royal

2070
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,780
portion popper posh and proper and calm.

2071
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:28,800
Yeah,

2072
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,633
and creep on.

2073
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:31,560
If you see that,

2074
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:35,850
like that whole set up with
the castle and all that jazz,

2075
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:38,250
it's really fascinating because
they don't really run the country,

2076
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:38,700
right?

2077
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,210
No.

2078
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,420
Do No home.

2079
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,240
You guys have like a democracy,

2080
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:42,451
right?

2081
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:42,620
Yeah,

2082
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,540
100% yeah.

2083
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,100
Yeah.

2084
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,281
Do,

2085
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:44,471
do,

2086
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:44,701
do,

2087
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:45,780
do kings can go.

2088
00:55:45,781 --> 00:55:47,400
Pop was not pry them.

2089
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,640
Can you try them for
crimes and shit like that?

2090
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,070
No.

2091
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:51,570
I think that I,

2092
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,120
this is what

2093
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,200
you calm but I can,

2094
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,711
I can,

2095
00:55:58,711 --> 00:55:59,900
if it was something,

2096
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:05,390
if the king got kink it the queen got
call during something like Lesbos Shit.

2097
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:08,663
Oh,

2098
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,780
you can't even say that.

2099
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:14,510
Hey can I just did American bitch land
of the free home of the brave and I'm

2100
00:56:14,511 --> 00:56:15,344
going to fuck.

2101
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:17,563
Oh,

2102
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,353
I can't tell you.

2103
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,070
I can't tell you that.

2104
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,160
I won't tell you that for my queen.

2105
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:25,660
No.

2106
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,470
Cross the line.

2107
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,303
Not True.

2108
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,210
I never sent jokingly as a
gentleman's is all jokes,

2109
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,690
no disrespect man to Her
Majesty the Queen as a joke.

2110
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,070
But if she did,

2111
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:36,491
what have we got?

2112
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:37,301
A bad ass bitch.

2113
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:41,060
What'd she had like some hot 20 year
old like Puerto Rican chick with like

2114
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,630
red lipstick and big areolas and shit.

2115
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,370
Her and the queen just
got caught making out.

2116
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,391
Could you talk about why?

2117
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:50,560
What's wrong with that man?

2118
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:51,483
Wouldn't it be great?

2119
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,020
Great if it was a guy,

2120
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:53,680
right?

2121
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,470
Wouldn't it be great if it was a guy
who was a guy who was an old guy?

2122
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:57,340
The queen single.

2123
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:57,761
Okay.

2124
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,250
If the old guy by himself
all of a sudden boom,

2125
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,170
he's got this hot 20 year old,

2126
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:07,530
just unbelievably ridiculously sexually
attractive woman on his lap making out

2127
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:08,080
with them.

2128
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,130
Wouldn't that be awesome?

2129
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:09,611
It would,

2130
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:10,080
right?

2131
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:10,201
Well,

2132
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:10,931
is there anything wrong?

2133
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:11,411
Bls,

2134
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:11,800
vion.

2135
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,970
I say there's not.

2136
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,130
I see there's nothing
wrong with being a lesbian.

2137
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:20,131
So I say if the queen was a lesbian
and she was getting some hot posts,

2138
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,430
good for her.

2139
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,183
I don't want to see it.

2140
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:26,200
I don't want to see it happen.

2141
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,900
But off to say you don't want to see,

2142
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:29,590
you don't want to send you a link.

2143
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,793
You're going to college.

2144
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,010
You're going to click that link.

2145
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,370
I'm going to send you a link to Colossae.

2146
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,450
Motherfucker too.

2147
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,590
Man picks thing.

2148
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,240
I know I'm going to about

2149
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:51,160
500 times in a row while gambling.

2150
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,330
Oh yeah,

2151
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:55,840
that's,

2152
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,500
yeah,

2153
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,790
but you wouldn't want to watch.

2154
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:58,890
You would still want
to watch you to queen.

2155
00:57:58,910 --> 00:57:59,743
Have a good time.

2156
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,693
There's nothing wrong with,

2157
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,070
I wouldn't,

2158
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:01,810
I wouldn't know.

2159
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:02,380
You wouldn't.

2160
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,470
Just out of out of fair.

2161
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,383
What is that?

2162
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,220
It's the Prince Harry or whatever it.

2163
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,240
They got a picture of
him naked and the chick

2164
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,520
in Vegas who did that?

2165
00:58:12,521 --> 00:58:13,390
Who took that picture?

2166
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,210
I think the folks had a circus circus.

2167
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,670
The circus art cause they went,

2168
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:21,070
they went hunting rest
house and style in Vegas,

2169
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,230
acid it up and circus circus.

2170
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:24,490
That real picture.

2171
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,170
Was that a hidden camera or something?

2172
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,900
I think they probably
tell your people that.

2173
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:29,770
It's not a real picture,

2174
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:31,810
but I bet you know what I bet it is,

2175
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:32,230
man.

2176
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:35,080
I bet a lot of people that
are inside the organization,

2177
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:36,340
they do that shit on purpose.

2178
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:38,080
They leaked that stuff for publicity.

2179
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,060
They build a business.

2180
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,100
You don't think that's a rough patch.

2181
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,140
I know I fucked a kid.

2182
00:58:43,141 --> 00:58:44,200
You guys holding his Dick?

2183
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,180
I don't hold my Dick when I'm by myself.

2184
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:46,721
Okay.

2185
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:48,130
If I'm walking around the Vegas,

2186
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:49,030
I'm slinging a dick.

2187
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,893
Like when did that start?

2188
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:50,830
When did that come on?

2189
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:53,830
It's slapping my left side's
slap on my right side.

2190
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,240
I'm not holding it like that.

2191
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:57,580
That guy's holding it because he
knows they're taking a picture.

2192
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:58,540
That's what I say.

2193
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,110
Okay.

2194
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,790
That was some Colombo type shit,

2195
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:01,450
son.

2196
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,680
I want some credit for that.

2197
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:08,530
It was leaked to Geiber
and Tom Selleck combined.

2198
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,580
If it's a picture of you
name Vegas Holding your deck.

2199
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,150
Oh,

2200
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:13,780
look at it.

2201
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:13,931
Oh,

2202
00:59:13,931 --> 00:59:14,560
come on man.

2203
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:14,890
These are,

2204
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,720
these guys know these
pictures are being taken.

2205
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:17,580
Nope.

2206
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:17,830
No,

2207
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:18,663
that Israel.

2208
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,440
I think someone busted out a cell phone.

2209
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:22,790
That's what I think you're saying.

2210
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:26,180
No real because you believe that it's
impossible for royals to do anything

2211
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:27,014
wrong.

2212
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:31,130
How many people are still
brainwashed by the royals?

2213
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:31,881
In in England.

2214
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:34,760
Is it like still an important thing left
field if you will like fuck the queen

2215
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:35,594
when people are like,

2216
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,190
oh it depends on your circle of friends.

2217
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,200
Well as my friends,

2218
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,180
your friends wouldn't know.

2219
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:41,631
They'd be like,

2220
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:42,321
yeah for the Queen.

2221
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:43,131
But because if you,

2222
00:59:43,131 --> 00:59:45,650
if you said you're allowed to
say like fuck the president,

2223
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,810
you could say that in this
country and people will go,

2224
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:48,650
hey,

2225
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,484
easy.

2226
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,890
But they won't like attack
you and beat you up.

2227
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:53,600
But I would imagine by the way,

2228
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:55,000
all that stuff that I
said about the queen,

2229
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:55,791
these are just choke.

2230
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:56,531
So He's a gentleman.

2231
00:59:56,531 --> 00:59:56,871
I just,

2232
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:59,270
no disrespect meant we're
talking about the queen.

2233
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,370
I would go with it about my own mother.

2234
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:01,761
Okay.

2235
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:04,700
I would say that joke about my
own mother because it's not like,

2236
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:05,060
again,

2237
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,230
nothing wrong with being a lesbian.

2238
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:08,930
And if my mom was lesbian I
wanted to hook up with a hottie.

2239
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:13,640
So it's my own mom who I love more than
anybody on the planet cause my mom.

2240
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,320
So no worries about it.

2241
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,154
Ladies and gentlemen,

2242
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,270
these are just jokes.

2243
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:18,770
Um,

2244
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:19,820
how many people were like,

2245
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,800
cause like I know that it's,

2246
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:22,260
it's,

2247
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,130
it's,

2248
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:26,840
it's got a lot more reverence
to it then the president does,

2249
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:27,290
right?

2250
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:27,830
Yeah.

2251
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:28,910
Well like,

2252
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,791
like I said earlier,

2253
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:30,624
it's so old,

2254
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,840
so old it even go back.

2255
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,550
Like I don't even know cause I think
how the fuck did that come to pass?

2256
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,790
Jemaine like that.

2257
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:40,821
Basically.

2258
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:41,654
So hardest.

2259
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,510
He's got the fucking hobbyist gang.

2260
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,530
Yeah,

2261
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,250
exactly.

2262
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,083
That's what it was.

2263
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:47,931
Yeah.

2264
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:50,960
At one point in time and the good good
kings are the ones who didn't abuse you

2265
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:51,794
too much.

2266
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:52,860
Oh,

2267
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:53,693
he's a good kid.

2268
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:54,380
Yeah.

2269
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,110
He sent me mileage.

2270
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:00,110
It's this living way better than you and
for no reason [inaudible] behind him.

2271
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,833
People.

2272
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,470
Oh you be heading a wives.

2273
01:01:03,471 --> 01:01:04,490
Like what was that one guy,

2274
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:04,761
Henry,

2275
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:05,950
the Henry the eighth.

2276
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,400
That's when the kid get chopped.

2277
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:08,480
A bunch of his wives heads off.

2278
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,590
They got a little mouthy.

2279
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:10,581
He's was like,

2280
01:01:10,581 --> 01:01:10,941
bitch,

2281
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:11,770
I'm done.

2282
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:12,710
I'm done with this.

2283
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:12,981
Yeah,

2284
01:01:12,981 --> 01:01:13,190
he got,

2285
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:15,050
he would get sick of
them and assassinate him.

2286
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:17,390
I wonder what he would charge them with.

2287
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:18,560
Like,

2288
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,060
I don't need much of an excuse,

2289
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,260
but I bet he had a thing.

2290
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:25,520
Some probably a ledger people's
heads he chopped off probably.

2291
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,010
Yeah,

2292
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:27,400
you will.

2293
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,820
You watch like shows like game of Thrones
and I know it's bullshit where ladies

2294
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:35,330
and gentlemen before I'll talk about
game of Thrones and people were like,

2295
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:35,830
you know,

2296
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:36,680
so real right.

2297
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:37,220
I'm like,

2298
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,140
please give me more credit than this.

2299
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,780
I saw the dragons are southern,

2300
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:41,151
which is,

2301
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:42,110
I'm sure it's not real,

2302
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:45,740
but it's supposed to
represent at least the idea,

2303
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,390
the idea of a time,

2304
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,201
you know,

2305
01:01:48,201 --> 01:01:51,890
it's supposed to represent without all
the fantasy stuff attached to it as well.

2306
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:56,510
But it's also supposed to represent an
idea of a time when there was blacksmiths

2307
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,040
and swords and horses,

2308
01:01:58,041 --> 01:01:59,390
but that was the technology.

2309
01:01:59,391 --> 01:02:00,530
It sort of ended there.

2310
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,240
There wasn't really any medicine.

2311
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:04,070
There wasn't really any refrigerators.

2312
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,890
He just had fucking plates of fruit.

2313
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:07,770
If you were the king,

2314
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,320
like drumsticks,

2315
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:10,683
massive ones,

2316
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,620
Turkey legs and shit.

2317
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:17,030
What with the big fucking baby
mutton in a beer Stein Stein,

2318
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:17,923
right?

2319
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:18,920
Like ever see.

2320
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:20,740
Yeah,

2321
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,290
I love that.

2322
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:22,123
That's your people.

2323
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,293
It's a good movie.

2324
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,800
That's a fun movie.

2325
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:26,690
Which was that a cartoon?

2326
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,161
Yeah.

2327
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:27,411
Yeah.

2328
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:27,981
Yeah.

2329
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:28,490
Amazing.

2330
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:29,211
Cgi.

2331
01:02:29,211 --> 01:02:31,040
That was a great fun movie.

2332
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:31,900
Selena jellies.

2333
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:32,743
Boobies.

2334
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:33,360
Cartoon.

2335
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,460
Angelina Jolie.

2336
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,770
You remember when that goes?

2337
01:02:35,771 --> 01:02:39,530
Some bid as Shitty as Lindsay
Lohan got some big ass.

2338
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,463
That's a good song.

2339
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:41,443
Great Song.

2340
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,530
Halle Berry got some big ass titties.

2341
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,110
She just,

2342
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:47,090
if you could find that,

2343
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,160
but it'll get us kicked off youtube.

2344
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,003
Well,

2345
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,800
I don't think it was like a real song.

2346
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:53,090
There's not registered.

2347
01:02:53,091 --> 01:02:55,830
Give it a chance because
there's no way they fucking car.

2348
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:56,750
I'm helping them.

2349
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,680
Jesus Christ.

2350
01:02:57,681 --> 01:02:58,514
Ladies and gentlemen,

2351
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,520
we have to worry about getting
our shit booted off youtube.

2352
01:03:01,521 --> 01:03:06,290
If we have copyrighted material
sometimes got some big ass titties.

2353
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,380
Halle Berry got some big ass titties.

2354
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:09,891
Yeah.

2355
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:11,480
That could have been a fun way.

2356
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:12,500
Even if you were the king.

2357
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:17,501
I would rather be a dude who has like
a decent job today than a king in 2000

2358
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,030
years ago.

2359
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:20,863
Wouldn't you

2360
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:23,170
know Kakadu good.

2361
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:24,860
You could do good if you were the king.

2362
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:25,071
Oh,

2363
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:26,120
is that how you would rock it?

2364
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:28,143
They'll kill you.

2365
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,230
They'll go right after
you fucking kill you.

2366
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,320
Usually is this

2367
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,180
big ass titties time,

2368
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:37,014
Lindsay loans.

2369
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,010
If he see

2370
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,120
cups of tea cups,

2371
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:50,820
sweater,

2372
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,560
I'm trying to,

2373
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:26,070
it's,

2374
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,740
I'm so happy that black
people exist because white
people will never figured out

2375
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,580
what app they would have never figured
out how you could brag like endlessly and

2376
01:04:34,581 --> 01:04:37,190
it actually can be an art
form and for fun to listen to.

2377
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,560
It's fun to listen to.

2378
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,340
White people lack the flavor to
have come up with rap on their own.

2379
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:46,460
Like we needed black people
around to like spice it up,

2380
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,810
which very important.

2381
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:48,440
There's,

2382
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,580
it would never come out with that.

2383
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,800
There's a song out right now,

2384
01:04:50,801 --> 01:04:51,634
Joe,

2385
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:52,810
it's from bear.

2386
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,840
I got some big ass today.

2387
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,260
The guy's named like asap
rocky I think as this name.

2388
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:01,230
And it's caught fucking
problems and there so many,

2389
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:04,260
so many cuss words in the song that
that when they played on the radio,

2390
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,071
it's seriously,

2391
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:06,400
they drink it.

2392
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:07,843
Like you're sitting there like,

2393
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:08,281
wait a sec,

2394
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:08,610
I,

2395
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:12,180
you can't understand a word they're
saying but has this catchy like,

2396
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:16,290
like Ryan that's underneath it that
you get into and now it's like a number

2397
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:16,980
three song.

2398
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,180
And you can't understand a word

2399
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,560
that's the name of it.

2400
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,440
It's called fucking problems by asap.

2401
01:05:22,441 --> 01:05:23,274
Rocky.

2402
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,640
Actually [inaudible] version,

2403
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,510
but I don't want to play,

2404
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:26,310
I don't even play it.

2405
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:31,310
I think that the universe is letting
us know in no uncertain terms that it's

2406
01:05:31,801 --> 01:05:33,480
over the fucking shows over.

2407
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,640
It's getting completely wacky.

2408
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,560
I think that's what reality TV is.

2409
01:05:37,561 --> 01:05:38,940
I think that's what this song will be.

2410
01:05:38,941 --> 01:05:41,850
The number three songs in the
world go back to like the year,

2411
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:42,811
whatever it was,

2412
01:05:42,811 --> 01:05:45,420
when midnight rider came out
from the Allman brothers.

2413
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:50,160
And to compare that song to this fucking
ridiculous song that has a million

2414
01:05:50,161 --> 01:05:51,520
customers that you can't even play.

2415
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,740
It's just a core.

2416
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:54,300
It's free.

2417
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,360
It's so ridiculous.

2418
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,130
Want to hear it?

2419
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:56,380
It's,

2420
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,310
it's the aliens are sending
us a signal to saying,

2421
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,180
build your ship.

2422
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:00,811
Okay,

2423
01:06:00,811 --> 01:06:01,890
and get off this rock.

2424
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:03,570
They're going to start eating each other.

2425
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,570
It's fucking honey booboo.

2426
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:09,630
It's going to become an adult and
she's going to run the planet.

2427
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,560
That's what's going to happen,

2428
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:11,423
dude.

2429
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:12,920
What is the next,

2430
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:13,761
yeah,

2431
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:14,570
what is accident?

2432
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,510
What was the wall?

2433
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:16,910
Um,

2434
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:17,601
what's next for you,

2435
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:17,811
man?

2436
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:18,650
Do you just fought right.

2437
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,430
Where'd you fight?

2438
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,000
Not,

2439
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,140
not for while I let,

2440
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,690
my last flight was Bobby
Lashley and I got my cheat bump,

2441
01:06:23,691 --> 01:06:24,220
Balkan.

2442
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:24,680
Um,

2443
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,890
my Alberto bone got fuck shoots up.

2444
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,940
Popped me out for a while.

2445
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:31,430
That was a big victory for you.

2446
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:31,971
Yeah,

2447
01:06:31,971 --> 01:06:33,490
it was a legit victory.

2448
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:35,510
Like a good big name.

2449
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah,

2450
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,010
it was a good fight.

2451
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:37,550
You know,

2452
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:37,761
you,

2453
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:39,470
you pulled it off for three rounds.

2454
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:39,730
Yeah,

2455
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,800
I watched it not long ago on a fault.

2456
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,370
Just edged it,

2457
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,150
Josh.

2458
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:44,600
Sacha.

2459
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,433
It was close.

2460
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,090
Um,

2461
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:46,960
those are satisfying,

2462
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:47,500
aren't they?

2463
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,333
Well,

2464
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:49,930
I mean,

2465
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,310
I went to plan,

2466
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:52,970
I stopped his take downs.

2467
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:57,990
My cardio was a much better if you
did take me and I got right back up.

2468
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,493
I felt good.

2469
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,770
But why let me down with standup?

2470
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,220
My standard was too slow.

2471
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,920
It was like he was beating me to it.

2472
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:05,740
I was main event,

2473
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,270
finish him off with his standup,

2474
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,400
but he was too quick.

2475
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,120
Um,

2476
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,070
it was beating me to
the punch and I thought,

2477
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:12,311
right,

2478
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:12,671
fuck it.

2479
01:07:12,671 --> 01:07:16,300
I'm going to have to get them to
the cage and make it just massive.

2480
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,410
Just keep him in because he was tired.

2481
01:07:18,411 --> 01:07:19,780
He want to move to keep him.

2482
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:20,890
Fuck him.

2483
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,753
Well,

2484
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,490
it was good where I managed
to do what I want to do,

2485
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:25,600
but I didn't capitalize.

2486
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,830
That guy is a weird example
of like a physical specimen.

2487
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:30,970
He's so muscular.

2488
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:31,810
You're looking at me go,

2489
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:32,810
how could that guy,

2490
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:33,970
he did more cardio.

2491
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:37,510
He seems like a guy who probably
should be like a two or five or right.

2492
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:37,910
Yeah.

2493
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:39,110
It's too big for his family.

2494
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,230
He's got so much meat on him,

2495
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,730
but he's so impressive looking.

2496
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,210
Yeah.

2497
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:44,043
Because of that,

2498
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,670
it used to be at a time,

2499
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:45,911
you know,

2500
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:47,860
you look at a guy who's
built like that and go,

2501
01:07:47,861 --> 01:07:48,321
well that guy,

2502
01:07:48,321 --> 01:07:49,440
I'd probably kick a lot of apps,

2503
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:50,201
but now you know,

2504
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:54,850
like that guy is handicapped
almost like when you to bag.

2505
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,540
It's like when I fought
[inaudible] and so many gaps.

2506
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,000
Yeah.

2507
01:07:59,000 --> 01:07:59,180
You

2508
01:07:59,180 --> 01:07:59,751
know what?

2509
01:07:59,751 --> 01:08:02,210
I remember he was
statistically based strong,

2510
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:05,660
so he got me in a belly
to belly suplex me over,

2511
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:06,920
um,

2512
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,170
you know,

2513
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:07,231
uh,

2514
01:08:07,231 --> 01:08:08,500
landed on it.

2515
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:12,980
He was on top of me and I felt like
under hook and eye he was just a big gap.

2516
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,240
Closes.

2517
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,160
I am too.

2518
01:08:15,161 --> 01:08:16,060
So also is

2519
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:16,691
not aware.

2520
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:17,180
I mean he's,

2521
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,740
he's mixed martial arts training.

2522
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,630
It's very limited.

2523
01:08:19,631 --> 01:08:21,820
I watched him hit the pads and everything.

2524
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:22,780
It's like it was comical.

2525
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:26,380
So like well this guy never punched in
his life and they teach them how to punch

2526
01:08:26,381 --> 01:08:28,710
now that soaks these mindset.

2527
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,050
Yes.

2528
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:29,880
And animal.

2529
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,060
Well a fucking animal.

2530
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:32,340
The fuck t fault.

2531
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,930
Do you know what I was
talking earlier about,

2532
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:34,620
you know,

2533
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,220
six weeks and I ain't got big ego book.

2534
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:39,510
I've got Marvin,

2535
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:40,311
he got that obviously.

2536
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:42,130
How he visualized due to John,

2537
01:08:42,131 --> 01:08:44,210
I mean right because put your Nice Keith,

2538
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:47,580
thanks for you know he
jumps in the Tim Silvia.

2539
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:47,851
Yeah.

2540
01:08:47,851 --> 01:08:49,550
Tell me fucking it's a worst fight

2541
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,040
ever.

2542
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:50,873
Ever.

2543
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,220
He's so tall.

2544
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:53,210
So vain G,

2545
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,770
very dangerous guy.

2546
01:08:54,771 --> 01:08:56,360
And if I ever motivated,

2547
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:58,500
cause he just lost to Ray
Mercer said wanted it,

2548
01:08:58,750 --> 01:08:59,470
you know,

2549
01:08:59,470 --> 01:08:59,691
he,

2550
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:00,560
that was an embarrassing,

2551
01:09:00,561 --> 01:09:01,394
lost it.

2552
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:01,910
Yeah.

2553
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:02,900
So he wanted to,

2554
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:03,620
to,

2555
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:03,921
to,

2556
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:05,670
to put a good mark on his ledger and put,

2557
01:09:05,671 --> 01:09:06,920
you announced it was a perfect one,

2558
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:08,860
eight pudgy now scalable high,

2559
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:09,770
like you fucking know.

2560
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:13,750
It was like the body beautiful versus
a guy with not the greatest shit.

2561
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:14,810
Yeah,

2562
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:15,050
no,

2563
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:15,621
not the greatest.

2564
01:09:15,621 --> 01:09:17,480
Genetics kicked the fucking
shit out of that body.

2565
01:09:17,481 --> 01:09:18,250
Beautiful.

2566
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:18,690
Easy.

2567
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:19,523
It wasn't no problem.

2568
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,141
It was a,

2569
01:09:20,141 --> 01:09:24,350
it fascinating to see how willing that
guy is like right away to fight high

2570
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,184
level guys.

2571
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,083
It's going back.

2572
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:27,220
It's going pop quiz.

2573
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:28,050
He started off

2574
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:32,250
like that and then after
the second loss to me,

2575
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,473
which is bullet,

2576
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,680
it wasn't lost to me.

2577
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:35,220
He was,

2578
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:38,040
he claimed to have won the fight
and then they've invested decision.

2579
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:40,763
Well

2580
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:42,690
that,

2581
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:44,010
that's some fuckery right there.

2582
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,780
Is that in Poland and how
do you know what it is it,

2583
01:09:48,781 --> 01:09:49,551
do you know why I was up?

2584
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:52,470
He to me always fucking up his to
me because I'm the guy who's mad,

2585
01:09:52,471 --> 01:09:53,304
he'd been knocked Tate.

2586
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:53,971
I'm like,

2587
01:09:53,971 --> 01:09:54,870
the goats had a few.

2588
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,670
I'm semi legitimate.

2589
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:57,563
So I'm like,

2590
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:58,380
but people like,

2591
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:58,591
oh,

2592
01:09:58,591 --> 01:09:58,861
you know,

2593
01:09:58,861 --> 01:09:59,281
he's got,

2594
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:00,114
um,

2595
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:00,511
you know,

2596
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:01,590
he's had a few wins.

2597
01:10:01,591 --> 01:10:01,831
He's,

2598
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:02,970
he's not a complete bomb.

2599
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,530
So they put me up there,

2600
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,453
I look the part,

2601
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:07,560
I'll come to fight but unbeatable.

2602
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,280
So then you know that guy who's
ready to take the next level,

2603
01:10:11,281 --> 01:10:12,720
he's thinking he's beating Tim Silvia,

2604
01:10:12,721 --> 01:10:15,150
don't forget [inaudible] I think
the fucking Fuck Thompson up.

2605
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,130
But it didn't quite go,

2606
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:17,760
go,

2607
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,593
go like that.

2608
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:18,921
Yeah.

2609
01:10:18,921 --> 01:10:20,490
I think also that's the thing,

2610
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,330
the guy became this amazing
power lifting champion,

2611
01:10:24,331 --> 01:10:28,310
this strong man champion because he has
just an undeniable belief in himself.

2612
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:30,860
So he probably just thinks
he doesn't give a fuck.

2613
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:32,900
He keeps running into reality.

2614
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:33,500
Yes,

2615
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:33,940
yes.

2616
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:34,120
Yeah.

2617
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,700
That kind of needs like a it guy like
that needs like a real legit coach.

2618
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:40,100
Like a Greg Jackson or a Matt Hume.

2619
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:41,240
Like someone's going to
sit them down and go,

2620
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:42,074
listen,

2621
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,660
there's only one way we're going
to do this and do it right.

2622
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,900
You going to keep your brain okay and
that she actually learned how to fight and

2623
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:48,530
then you fight.

2624
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:49,363
I think he is.

2625
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:50,060
Yeah,

2626
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:50,410
Tom.

2627
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:52,550
And be getting smaller.

2628
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,870
It's getting smaller as well.

2629
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:54,290
Right.

2630
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:57,470
He's getting back what
Catholic and you know,

2631
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,110
took me the fuck it's mine.

2632
01:10:59,150 --> 01:10:59,983
You know what I mean?

2633
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,950
So I forget

2634
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,750
that part I give him credit for,

2635
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,190
but he's a fucking prick.

2636
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,330
He's a pro Israel.

2637
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:07,893
It's eyes.

2638
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,590
He's not a nice guy.

2639
01:11:09,591 --> 01:11:10,191
He's not a nice guy.

2640
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:11,580
Do you know when I was at KSW?

2641
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:12,370
Um,

2642
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:13,750
of the staff or the no,

2643
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,121
I had to,

2644
01:11:14,121 --> 01:11:16,520
I talked to when he was really nice on uh,

2645
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:17,481
on the,

2646
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:22,481
on the doing song grabs you hand when
someone grabs your hand to shake it and

2647
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,420
then they do that finger thing.

2648
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:24,760
No,

2649
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:24,871
no,

2650
01:11:24,871 --> 01:11:25,101
no.

2651
01:11:25,101 --> 01:11:25,934
I'm the golf.

2652
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:26,921
Oh yeah,

2653
01:11:26,921 --> 01:11:27,820
with the second arm.

2654
01:11:27,821 --> 01:11:28,654
Why did they do that?

2655
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,420
You like get your base,

2656
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:32,201
you lower your base.

2657
01:11:32,201 --> 01:11:33,460
This mother is good at judo.

2658
01:11:33,461 --> 01:11:34,770
Me fucking out.

2659
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,470
Joe Bitch.

2660
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:37,661
Yeah.

2661
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:37,931
Why?

2662
01:11:37,931 --> 01:11:38,550
Why did they do,

2663
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:43,550
but I think it says an emphasis to
really have to really have a home.

2664
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,633
It's a hand hug.

2665
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:49,570
I don't mind it as long as it's a touch
to touch with the other arm when you

2666
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:50,381
grabbed my wrist.

2667
01:11:50,381 --> 01:11:51,870
Especially if you go with one of the gene,

2668
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:53,530
the bell finger lock type of situation.

2669
01:11:53,531 --> 01:11:57,720
I don't think that thinking of it like
three fingers and you really got to

2670
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,760
fucking read the gene about fucking
handbook and he shoots this great time.

2671
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,080
Great Handbook.

2672
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,210
If you want to fucking
kill somewhere walking,

2673
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,670
weird dudes will do.

2674
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,760
Well they'll hold onto your knee
whether telling you something.

2675
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:14,950
What the fuck is that
when you're sitting down,

2676
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,100
are you sitting down like in some
easy chairs next to each other?

2677
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:18,700
Older dudes would do it.

2678
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:19,610
When they have a,

2679
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:20,710
they got some important to tell.

2680
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,810
You know,

2681
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,600
Bobby,

2682
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,820
I need to suck your Dick Right now.

2683
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:26,681
I'm thinking,

2684
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:26,920
boy,

2685
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,860
the Dahlia I like and they
want you to really listen.

2686
01:12:29,861 --> 01:12:30,880
They will like hold your,

2687
01:12:30,881 --> 01:12:34,390
they were like even put a hand
like not even like a full claw,

2688
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:37,120
but to let you know that if he wanted to
they could make the shit uncomfortable.

2689
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,600
I tell you some shit about the government.

2690
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:42,280
They don't have this happen to me.

2691
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,870
You don't talk to old dudes.

2692
01:12:43,871 --> 01:12:44,704
Yeah.

2693
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,530
I talked to the old dudes that want
us to show me that they know shit.

2694
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:50,400
The worst one for me to,

2695
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:51,430
I've got this black eye.

2696
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,530
Um,

2697
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:52,810

2698
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,940

01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:03,250

2705

Yeah.

2706
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,490

2707
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:06,000

2711
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:13,300

2715

Why do people do that when
they want to talk to you?

2716
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,490
Hold on to you.

2717
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,710
So we pause because it's so
important what they're going to say.

2718
01:13:20,711 --> 01:13:22,600
Dan Henderson the back
of your head and shit.

2719
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:23,560
No Man.

2720
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:23,820

2722
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:25,600

2723
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,740

01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:28,320
What's going to start
to me it's like fuck.

2725
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,710
So that's how he got that black eye.

2726
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:30,280
Yeah.

2727
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,660
What happened while I was,

2728
01:13:31,661 --> 01:13:32,350
um,

2729
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:33,010
I work,

2730
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:33,700
um,

2731
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,290
well he's my main,

2732
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:40,060
but I go to his club and I do security
for just normal clothes off a drink with

2733
01:13:40,061 --> 01:13:40,740
him.

2734
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:41,390
I got,

2735
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,160
I don't,

2736
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:42,761
I do whatever.

2737
01:13:42,761 --> 01:13:44,110
I fucking want a drink.

2738
01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:45,443
Um,

2739
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,200
so I was going on with security,

2740
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:48,460
but you're also like a patriot.

2741
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:50,523
Okay.

2742
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:52,290
So you just do it to hang out with them?

2743
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,313
Yeah,

2744
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:54,790
I told you we don't even have to pay me.

2745
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:55,310
Oh,

2746
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:55,740
okay.

2747
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:56,730
I told her you know about,

2748
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,820
but he does anyone who's your voice.

2749
01:13:58,821 --> 01:14:00,100
So you go there and you hang out with,

2750
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:02,740
so your security just by existing.

2751
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:04,390
There you go.

2752
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:04,781
So,

2753
01:14:04,781 --> 01:14:05,560
uh,

2754
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:05,861
so,

2755
01:14:05,861 --> 01:14:06,071
so,

2756
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:06,301
so,

2757
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:07,550
so then what,

2758
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:08,523
like what am I saying?

2759
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:09,670
I don't know.

2760
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:10,381
I don't go to it.

2761
01:14:10,381 --> 01:14:10,541
Yeah,

2762
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:11,870
that's why I hope it's
gonna be good though.

2763
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,013
So,

2764
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:15,370
so if I can remember that.

2765
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,750
So W W we,

2766
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,930
we there and um,

2767
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:22,760
so if someone punches the binary black,

2768
01:14:22,761 --> 01:14:23,221
oh yeah,

2769
01:14:23,221 --> 01:14:23,570

2770
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,970
So on punches the bathroom and floods,

2771
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,540

2772
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:32,030
He pumps the fucking container
with the Walkman or something.

2773
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,660
And,

2774
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:32,920
and,

2775
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:33,400
and,

2776
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,620
and how you guys have like one of
them old school above the toilet?

2777
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:36,930

2778
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:37,151
yeah,

2779
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:37,850
yeah,

2780
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:38,683
yeah,

2781
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:39,370
yeah.

2782
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:39,740
Wow.

2783
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:40,640
That's hilarious.

2784
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:42,590
So I,

2785
01:14:42,591 --> 01:14:44,660
so I went to look for the guy who did it,

2786
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:45,560
so I said,

2787
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:45,651
oh,

2788
01:14:45,651 --> 01:14:46,460
I'll have a look.

2789
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:46,860
And he said,

2790
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:47,693
white tee shirt.

2791
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:50,930
So I'm on the way down the dance floor.

2792
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:52,213
And um,

2793
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:53,850
this girl steps from a toll,

2794
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,450
she steps on your toe
and she wobbles a bit.

2795
01:14:56,690 --> 01:15:00,290
So I capture under the arm securely safe.

2796
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:01,461
And I got and she goes,

2797
01:15:01,461 --> 01:15:02,294
oh yeah.

2798
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,100
She said something to me.

2799
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:08,180
And then this bloke came out of
nowhere fucking peacock in it.

2800
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,680
I get invited my face,

2801
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,610
peacock minute means
spreading as feathers.

2802
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:12,920
Yeah.

2803
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,130
He's letting me talking shit.

2804
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:15,830
I was like talking to his message.

2805
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,000
He just happened to like this skinny
fucking much look to light from the back

2806
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:22,100
foot turned her face was hollow.

2807
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,640
She had fucking Lord to make

2808
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:26,430
the story better.

2809
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:28,660
Is that math out couple?

2810
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:29,240
She,

2811
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:29,810

2812
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:30,081
Yeah.

2813
01:15:30,081 --> 01:15:30,530
Okay.

2814
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:30,891
Yeah.

2815
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:35,030
Needle needles and then fucking
needles fall out of refineries.

2816
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:35,300
Oh,

2817
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,133
stop it.

2818
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,033
Um,

2819
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:38,640
and the guy dropped it.

2820
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,830
He started saying,

2821
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:42,230
I said something to him and he
was taking my kind of kindness,

2822
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:42,900
uh,

2823
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:43,860
me being okay.

2824
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:47,080
I don't want to find no reason to,

2825
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,670
so might be an ally and he's
taking that as a weakness.

2826
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,780
I can see it happening and I,

2827
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,040
it's almost like a know what's
going to happen if I can't do it.

2828
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,890
I could just say fuck off
quick and just kill it dead,

2829
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,360
but I don't,

2830
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,700
and it anywhere law.

2831
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:01,693
And uh,

2832
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,360
then he did that and I pushed his hand
off and he fucking hit me fucking that

2833
01:16:05,361 --> 01:16:05,811
left hook,

2834
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:06,644
man.

2835
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:08,960
You hit him back.

2836
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:09,793
Did you bring his arm?

2837
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:12,000
You cannot fucking colossus leak.

2838
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:13,881
Yeah.

2839
01:16:13,881 --> 01:16:16,470
That's a big mistake when you punch it,

2840
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:17,061
dude like you,

2841
01:16:17,061 --> 01:16:19,190
and then he's still there
and now you're mad like,

2842
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,203
dammit.

2843
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,073
Are you ticklish?

2844
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:22,813
No,

2845
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:26,410
you are [inaudible] his head.

2846
01:16:26,411 --> 01:16:27,244
Move

2847
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:29,600
on.

2848
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,440
Do it Brian.

2849
01:16:30,441 --> 01:16:30,890
He'll,

2850
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:32,780
he'll break this whole fucking table.

2851
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:33,680
Brian.

2852
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,760
Sit the fuck down.

2853
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:38,350
You better not take on
any motherfucker my deck.

2854
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:43,220
I will kill him to see that he's Riley
and he getting confident and again,

2855
01:16:43,221 --> 01:16:44,450
comfortable with gay.

2856
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:49,550
He's trying to lure you into his
fucking spider web spider web of issues.

2857
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:50,391
Yeah.

2858
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:51,380
Give me one of them two below.

2859
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:53,420
That stuff's great.

2860
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:53,840
Um,

2861
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,300
thanks to a CTO,

2862
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,940
coconut water for sending
us all this delicious.

2863
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:00,390
If you ever,

2864
01:17:00,391 --> 01:17:00,950
uh,

2865
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:01,641
have a chance,

2866
01:17:01,641 --> 01:17:03,440
like if you're looking for
like coconut water to buy it,

2867
01:17:03,441 --> 01:17:04,880
they are not created equal.

2868
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:08,900
You want to make sure you get coconut
water that's from these Thai coconuts.

2869
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,590
That's [inaudible].

2870
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:11,600
That's uh,

2871
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,760
Brian and fucking Amy,

2872
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:14,630
Amy and Brian's.

2873
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,171
Is that what it is?

2874
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:15,590
Yeah.

2875
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:16,670
Amy and Brian's is,

2876
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:16,970
uh,

2877
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:17,690
the same,

2878
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:18,523
same time.

2879
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:19,450
Hey,

2880
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:21,200
he's the tickling each other.

2881
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,460
This is dangerous.

2882
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:26,160
He wouldn't even mean to kill
you by would just be an accident.

2883
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:27,950
I love him on the hook.

2884
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,193
You know,

2885
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:30,503
gone.

2886
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,120
Always killed a number one bus.

2887
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:34,730
Oh,

2888
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:35,650
poor Brian.

2889
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:37,570
I would never kill you opponent.

2890
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:41,020
He would hug you and everything
would just leak out of your asshole.

2891
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,740
I would a water bag,

2892
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:43,843
watch

2893
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:46,643
love and affection.

2894
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:50,220
His ass would just open up this rep,

2895
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:51,591
the whole inner,

2896
01:17:51,591 --> 01:17:53,820
it's just plot everything.

2897
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:55,280
Rib Cage,

2898
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:56,360
everything for,

2899
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,470
no one's even going to figure out how
rib cage got through his ass go right

2900
01:18:00,471 --> 01:18:03,020
through intact toying.

2901
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,390
It's going to come out
and roll across the floor

2902
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,830
where he realized he wasn't really,

2903
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:10,500
what can you Brian,

2904
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,500
it's something that I've already started
because I'm extremely ticketless and,

2905
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,500
and if I was a fighter,

2906
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:19,080
I think if I was like in
some crazy Jiu Jitsu thing,

2907
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,670
if the guy just started tickling me,

2908
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:21,803
freak the fuck out.

2909
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:22,691
No,

2910
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:22,901
no,

2911
01:18:22,901 --> 01:18:23,890
not when you're in the moment.

2912
01:18:23,891 --> 01:18:26,740
I'm thinking of because why
your chicken on the guy,

2913
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:30,250
the guys on top are you punching you
in the face and you're going to stop

2914
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:34,390
tickling part of Ticklin like the whole
thing is like someone's like got power

2915
01:18:34,391 --> 01:18:35,530
over you and you're like stop it.

2916
01:18:35,531 --> 01:18:36,940
You're making me feel
things I don't want to feel,

2917
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,590
you know,

2918
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:40,480
but it doesn't hurt but
it just feels weird.

2919
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:42,693
Not at all.

2920
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:43,730
Cause you know what,

2921
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:44,563
you're,

2922
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,620
you make the connection between
the impact of the fingers,

2923
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:50,470
but when someone else is controlling
that you don't know what kind of ride

2924
01:18:50,471 --> 01:18:54,280
you're going on and all that shit
is actually probably evolutionary,

2925
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,000
um,

2926
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,833
to uh,

2927
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,400
um,

2928
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,260
beneficial to keep spiders off of us.

2929
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,390
Like things that like
little things are moving.

2930
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:03,443
Like what am I going back?

2931
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:04,931
That's what that is.

2932
01:19:04,931 --> 01:19:08,830
It's like extra sensory for when spiders
and shit would crawl into your fucking

2933
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:09,670
sleeping bag,

2934
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:10,301
you know?

2935
01:19:10,301 --> 01:19:13,590
I mean that's probably what ti
being ticklish is all about.

2936
01:19:13,591 --> 01:19:13,651
You,

2937
01:19:13,651 --> 01:19:16,090
you have a sleeping back
fucking fucking the day.

2938
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:16,580
Yeah.

2939
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:16,751
Yeah,

2940
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:17,580
of course.

2941
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,520
I know Bryan always has a,

2942
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:21,370
a rescue pack in his car.

2943
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:22,730
Well,

2944
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:27,730
he's ready for this new Jack strangles
me to sleep or worried about the

2945
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,253
earthquake.

2946
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:33,970
And so he a a full emergency
set up in the back of his car,

2947
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,050
including ecstasy.

2948
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:39,370
Plenty of Molly fucking palm star.

2949
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:40,540
No,

2950
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,610
there's none in the trunk or
I cleaned it out last night.

2951
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,661
That's why those ones,

2952
01:19:46,661 --> 01:19:47,530
you say it and you're like,

2953
01:19:47,531 --> 01:19:48,364
damn,

2954
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:48,971
it was,

2955
01:19:48,971 --> 01:19:49,960
it seemed like it was there.

2956
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:51,910
I took a chance,

2957
01:19:51,911 --> 01:19:52,930
I threw it out there.

2958
01:19:52,931 --> 01:19:54,230
We bonk.

2959
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:55,841
So,

2960
01:19:55,841 --> 01:19:56,470
um,

2961
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:57,011
you got,

2962
01:19:57,011 --> 01:19:57,550
um,

2963
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,870
two big wins in a row,

2964
01:19:59,020 --> 01:19:59,291
right?

2965
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:01,840
With Bob South and with no,

2966
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,870
it was Bob's happened
in the same cell phone.

2967
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:05,501
Oh,

2968
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:06,334
that's right.

2969
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,800
The same I've Bobby Lashley

2970
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,460
if I have three big wins on the fourth,

2971
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,850
which is our class size or when,

2972
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,110
because it was a Bullock's
poaching Osceola.

2973
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:14,460
Yeah,

2974
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,780
that was totally horse shit.

2975
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:16,560
So,

2976
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,010
um,

2977
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:17,820
but the um,

2978
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,680
the Superfight league is in India.

2979
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:20,730
You enjoying that over there?

2980
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,110
I'm not with them anymore.

2981
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:23,010
You're not with them anymore.

2982
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,060
What happened?

2983
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:24,840
They cut my,

2984
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,020
well,

2985
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:25,853
they said to me,

2986
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,930
we can get you a fight.

2987
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:27,780
Um,

2988
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:28,510
it was um,

2989
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:29,010
we've got you,

2990
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:31,350
we want you to find what's his face,

2991
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,273
Todd Duffy.

2992
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:33,241
And it's like,

2993
01:20:33,241 --> 01:20:34,074
okay.

2994
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,030
And then like we want
to cut half your money.

2995
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,830
Well,

2996
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:41,220
and then where we want to
charge you 20% tax Indian tech.

2997
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:45,960
So they changed how they do business with
you and they didn't charge Indian tax

2998
01:20:45,961 --> 01:20:47,520
before that 10%.

2999
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,380
Are they outsourcing?

3000
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,630
Is that what's called the
outsourcing heavyweights?

3001
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,490
India's outsourcing as well.

3002
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:54,930
We outsourced to India.

3003
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,280
They had sorts heavyweights.

3004
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:56,930
They,

3005
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:57,510
they,

3006
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,530
they just,

3007
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,970
I think it did.

3008
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,010
I think a guy has a lot
of money and the CMA,

3009
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:04,320
I think I'd like to do that.

3010
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:04,600
Right.

3011
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,460
And you don't have it.

3012
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:06,383
I like it.

3013
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,970
And then the call to do it and uh,

3014
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,170
he's not quite as simple as that.

3015
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:11,370
They start bleeding money.

3016
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:11,611
Well,

3017
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:13,440
but people don't know what the fuck it is.

3018
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:17,070
Like me and Bob sat there and it's like,

3019
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,090
you know,

3020
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:18,923
it's wrestling,

3021
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:19,510
right.

3022
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:19,940
Really?

3023
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:20,960
Cause we both La and were,

3024
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:25,110
they both walked through this crazy thing
at the fucking press Konza or I to get

3025
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:25,531
you.

3026
01:21:25,531 --> 01:21:25,980
And he's like,

3027
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:26,251
ah.

3028
01:21:26,251 --> 01:21:28,950
And then the guys in the middle
where the Bollywood guys,

3029
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:29,661
you know what I mean?

3030
01:21:29,661 --> 01:21:30,450
Right.

3031
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:31,620
So it looks like bullshit.

3032
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,360
And then when Bob Sapp got injured,

3033
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,620
it really looked like bullshit.

3034
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:34,920
Right?

3035
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,490
Yeah.

3036
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:36,460
I tried to fall out,

3037
01:21:36,461 --> 01:21:36,630
boy.

3038
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:36,810
Yeah.

3039
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:38,160
But the first fight,

3040
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,350
it's been like the first ever UFC,

3041
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:43,080
it's fucking tooth comes out.

3042
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,900
That song gets fucking smacked.

3043
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:45,780
Oh,

3044
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,301
it's really,

3045
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,010
it was like that,

3046
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:47,370
right?

3047
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:50,180
This guy comes out Kinda,

3048
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:51,270
uh,

3049
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:52,280
professor acts.

3050
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,333
Yeah.

3051
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:56,850
Al bought someone me
and I'm straight away.

3052
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,000
It's fun.

3053
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,010
They had some good fights,

3054
01:21:59,011 --> 01:22:01,680
but is it that the guys
running out of cash,

3055
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:04,440
it's costing a lot of [inaudible] capture.

3056
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,930
Think he don't like losing it.

3057
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:07,681
Oh,

3058
01:22:07,681 --> 01:22:08,491
so he's losing that.

3059
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:10,110
So he's trying to like
minimize your mouth.

3060
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,280
He's losing basically.

3061
01:22:11,281 --> 01:22:11,700
Yes.

3062
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:11,971
Yeah.

3063
01:22:11,971 --> 01:22:14,910
It's not easy to fucking put
together a gigantic organization.

3064
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:19,650
Know a lot of people don't realize that
the UFC was $44 million in the hole

3065
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:24,270
before it started to turn around and
kind of profitable and that all became a,

3066
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,100
because of the ultimate fighter,

3067
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,300
they,

3068
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,350
they bank rolled that show.

3069
01:22:28,351 --> 01:22:30,000
They essentially put together a show,

3070
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:31,013
produced it,

3071
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:33,480
and then bought time on spike to air it.

3072
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,140
You know,

3073
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:35,340
it's really crazy,

3074
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:36,480
crazy fucking gamble.

3075
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:41,481
But the one that turned out incredibly
well to get that level of recognition for

3076
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:42,721
your organization,

3077
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:44,720
you got to have something
like via common behind you.

3078
01:22:44,721 --> 01:22:46,500
You're like what Bellah tours doing.

3079
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:48,260
You've got to have
something big behind you.

3080
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,100
You have to have a push where they have,

3081
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:50,371
okay,

3082
01:22:50,371 --> 01:22:50,940
look,

3083
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,820
we have determined that we
have x amount of talent.

3084
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,410
We have this amount of budget,

3085
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:56,850
we can go after new talent.

3086
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:59,610
We can offer people a commensurate,

3087
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,181
you know,

3088
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:04,650
a cash reward for wins that
you would get in the UFC.

3089
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,830
We can their money.

3090
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,431
So let's,

3091
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:07,211
let's get crazy here.

3092
01:23:07,211 --> 01:23:08,044
Let's see what we can do.

3093
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:12,820
But you have to be willing to lose a
lot of fucking to do that because until

3094
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,320
they start doing paper views,

3095
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:15,040
man,

3096
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,500
until they started doing paper views,

3097
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:17,830
where's all that money coming from?

3098
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:19,750
You can have some swirled
championship fights.

3099
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:24,070
Indians on the most athletic of people
either didn't know what they were great

3100
01:23:24,071 --> 01:23:26,870
wrestlers at one point in time as a spot.

3101
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:30,260
The Indian physique as a whole,

3102
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:31,303
not so good.

3103
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:32,750
What about the women though?

3104
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:34,040
No,

3105
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,970
often not.

3106
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,400
But the Bollywood,

3107
01:23:37,401 --> 01:23:40,520
once you've gotten the kind of thing
where they all want to be English,

3108
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:41,270
right?

3109
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,571
I mean,

3110
01:23:41,571 --> 01:23:46,340
so get as white as we can be and do
like the Japanese or the Chinese.

3111
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:48,890
I've seen it a few hot Indian porn stars.

3112
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:50,301
Yeah,

3113
01:23:50,301 --> 01:23:50,640
I mean,

3114
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,280
absolutely.

3115
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,760
I mean these hot everyone.

3116
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:53,650
That's true.

3117
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:54,483
You know what I mean?

3118
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:54,960
Right.

3119
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:55,710
But on,

3120
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:56,630
on the average,

3121
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:57,200
not so much,

3122
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:57,410
which,

3123
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:57,930
no,

3124
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,600
I'm into self fucking Paul.

3125
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,120
Either women are thinking
about fucking eating mean.

3126
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:02,980
Nevermind.

3127
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:03,691
It's flat for,

3128
01:24:03,691 --> 01:24:04,400
Huh.

3129
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,270
When I went,

3130
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:05,930
um,

3131
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:07,580
first time doing a press conference,

3132
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:09,590
I could not fucking believe it.

3133
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:10,670
I mean you see it on the,

3134
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:12,350
but that there was chaos.

3135
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:12,690
It,

3136
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:13,760
do you know what you were saying earlier?

3137
01:24:13,761 --> 01:24:17,390
Like over here there's
that different countries,

3138
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:18,500
different worlds.

3139
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,400
Fucking India.

3140
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,010
I mean I've been to a few places,

3141
01:24:22,011 --> 01:24:27,011
but that I was worried for my
message and Mylene I grants and uh,

3142
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:27,730
she,

3143
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:28,430
she,

3144
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:29,540
she said suicide.

3145
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:32,130
I'm surprised we haven't got this kid,

3146
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:35,360
like a little kid in the middle
of the world eating a banana,

3147
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,270
just sat there and it was busy as fuck.

3148
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,133
And the,

3149
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,190
the um,

3150
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:41,923
oh shit.

3151
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:42,321
The thing,

3152
01:24:42,321 --> 01:24:46,730
what fucking separates the world was
about that much and this little kid was

3153
01:24:46,731 --> 01:24:50,810
eating and Brianna just chilled out and
the song and the car going past wow.

3154
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,753
And I was like

3155
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:57,080
a strip of road on the street in
the middle and no one gives a fuck.

3156
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:59,390
No one gives a fuck.

3157
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:00,403
And I was like,

3158
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:02,990
and then grant says to us,

3159
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:03,940
fucking,

3160
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:06,860
I'm surprised you not seen any
wild dogs or anything like that.

3161
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:11,480
I'm literally turned my head and
there's this massive big fucking bull.

3162
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:13,281
Yeah.

3163
01:25:13,281 --> 01:25:13,731
Just fuck.

3164
01:25:13,731 --> 01:25:14,061
I forget.

3165
01:25:14,061 --> 01:25:16,430
It was a bull walking down
the road and I was like,

3166
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:17,503
fuck.

3167
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:18,800
They said mad,

3168
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:19,843
just chaos.

3169
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,350
And I walked on the road,

3170
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,301
I won't know.

3171
01:25:22,301 --> 01:25:23,570
So no one walks on the pavement.

3172
01:25:23,571 --> 01:25:26,900
Everyone walks on the fucking road and
a ball was just walking down the street.

3173
01:25:26,901 --> 01:25:27,320
Yeah.

3174
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,690
Jesus Christ just,

3175
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:29,543
okay.

3176
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,830
I watch out for the kid.

3177
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:34,730
A fucking ball and a
kid on the same street.

3178
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:35,790
Yeah.

3179
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:35,980
I mean,

3180
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,460
I think he just madness everywhere.

3181
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:38,841
Just madness.

3182
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:39,674
Everyone in your life.

3183
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,300
And then when we went to our hotel,

3184
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:42,643
the apocalypse,

3185
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,281
I mean if you,

3186
01:25:43,281 --> 01:25:43,880
if,

3187
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:44,720
if you can,

3188
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:44,961
you know,

3189
01:25:44,961 --> 01:25:45,771
if that came to England,

3190
01:25:45,771 --> 01:25:46,604
it would be the apocalypse,

3191
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:47,350
right canal.

3192
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,530
They all came to London.

3193
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:49,100
Yeah.

3194
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,230
There'll be the apocalypse that,

3195
01:25:50,231 --> 01:25:51,530
that big fucking game over.

3196
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,520
But it is the apocalypse,

3197
01:25:52,521 --> 01:25:52,820
right?

3198
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:53,653
It's just there.

3199
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:54,400
Yeah.

3200
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,940
So she can go visit the apocalypse,

3201
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:57,710
but they will all,

3202
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:58,940
they will for him.

3203
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:02,990
On the beach going in the going into the,

3204
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,213
uh,

3205
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:05,330
with the whole cloves on.

3206
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,410
Wow.

3207
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:06,630
I've,

3208
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:08,240
which I know that's sort the little thing,

3209
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:12,020
but it just seemed soul nor some
baby knows lying on the beach.

3210
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:16,580
Everyone was just standing on the beach
and in the water with the whole clause

3211
01:26:16,581 --> 01:26:16,850
on it.

3212
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:19,850
And I have hope and that fight is
that they're washing the clothes.

3213
01:26:19,851 --> 01:26:20,141
I,

3214
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:20,650
I don't,

3215
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:23,030
I fucking don't know while they fired.

3216
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:23,940
Fuck.

3217
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:28,940
But your problem to some
parts can be is huge.

3218
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:33,770
But Cindy bands have a real tiger
problem over the last 200 years.

3219
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:38,300
I think 300,000 people have been killed
there signing some insane number like

3220
01:26:38,301 --> 01:26:38,481
that.

3221
01:26:38,481 --> 01:26:39,920
Like they have a real problem.

3222
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:44,360
They have brackish water where it means
the water is not fresh and it's not

3223
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:44,781
salt.

3224
01:26:44,781 --> 01:26:45,800
It's a combination.

3225
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,220
It's not quite the solidity
of salt of seawater,

3226
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:49,671
but it's,

3227
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,740
it's more salty than regular freshwater.

3228
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,791
And because of that,

3229
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,170
the Tigers have nothing else to drink.

3230
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:57,350
And they drink that shit and they get
really agitated or they get really

3231
01:26:57,351 --> 01:26:57,831
aggressive,

3232
01:26:57,831 --> 01:26:59,120
don't die well,

3233
01:26:59,121 --> 01:26:59,954
they die,

3234
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:01,940
they become monsters.

3235
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:02,774
And he said,

3236
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:05,990
well,

3237
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:06,890
it doesn't work that way.

3238
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,640
You can imagine all you do
is add salt to tie forever.

3239
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:12,590
That'd be fuck no,

3240
01:27:12,591 --> 01:27:13,340
they um,

3241
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:13,880
they get,

3242
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:14,110
they,

3243
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:14,480
they,

3244
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,900
it's just only in theory that
that's why they're so aggressive.

3245
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:18,291
But the,

3246
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:22,520
also the other theories that
the typhoons come and I guess a,

3247
01:27:22,521 --> 01:27:24,140
these crazy storms that come,

3248
01:27:24,141 --> 01:27:25,190
a lot of people die.

3249
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:25,610
You know,

3250
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:29,120
a lot of people that are like near
the water or wind up in the water.

3251
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:33,940
So the Tigers wind up eating the bodies
that washed down the shore and there's

3252
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:35,120
so many of them in the water.

3253
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:36,380
Apparently they will just,

3254
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:38,840
a bunch of tigers will jump in
and they have no other meat.

3255
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:40,250
They'll just eat these bodies.

3256
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,390
They don't mind doing that.

3257
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:43,580
So then they develop a
taste for human flesh.

3258
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:47,570
So if the monsoons come or typhoons
or whatever they are and you know,

3259
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,380
kill a bunch of villagers in,

3260
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:52,130
a few of them wind up in the
water and tigers eat him.

3261
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:55,250
Those tigers now know what people
tastes like and they go looking for it.

3262
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,990
That's where it should get spooky.

3263
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:58,460
We'll watch.

3264
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,740
Talk me about India.

3265
01:28:00,741 --> 01:28:01,880
Like when we went,

3266
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:02,803
when I went to hospital,

3267
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,850
I was still half an extra week because,

3268
01:28:04,851 --> 01:28:05,090
uh,

3269
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,440
obviously I was having my face.

3270
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,613
Um,

3271
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:10,070
so what happened when the guy,

3272
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:11,750
this is from when the
guy sucker punched him?

3273
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:12,150
No,

3274
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:12,650
no,

3275
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:13,100
no,

3276
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:13,933
no.

3277
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:15,260
This is from Bobby.

3278
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:15,860
Last rites.

3279
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,270
Bobby last night he put my,

3280
01:28:17,271 --> 01:28:18,360
up until he broke it,

3281
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:19,650
he brought me out.

3282
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:21,350
The what happens when you
have an orbital break?

3283
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,490
Do you have to mash apartment?

3284
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:24,200
You've got some,

3285
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,830
apparently these are collapsible and they
obviously designed to be that the I'd

3286
01:28:28,831 --> 01:28:29,664
flops down.

3287
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:30,830
He protects your eyes.

3288
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:36,190
So it broke on the Po God
in that like a titanium God

3289
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,420
and now it's fucking good as gene.

3290
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:43,940
So they put a titanium guardian your face.

3291
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:49,130
Do you think you have dudes will ever
get titanium guards putting their face

3292
01:28:49,131 --> 01:28:50,360
without it breaking?

3293
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:51,680
Just to push tactic?

3294
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:52,790
Just show you don't get broken.

3295
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:53,750
Orbitals yeah,

3296
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:54,591
I mean it would work,

3297
01:28:54,591 --> 01:28:54,880
right?

3298
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:55,280
Well,

3299
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,320
I don't know because it's
meant to be collapsible.

3300
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:58,090
So much not,

3301
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:58,990
I said to the doctor,

3302
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:00,163
oh,

3303
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:00,940
I said to him,

3304
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:01,310
oh,

3305
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:02,130
he

3306
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,280
just wanted to be collapsible.

3307
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:04,031
And he says,

3308
01:29:04,031 --> 01:29:04,151
yeah,

3309
01:29:04,151 --> 01:29:05,350
I stuck with the titanium plate.

3310
01:29:05,351 --> 01:29:06,120
Won't be cops,

3311
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:06,860
will.

3312
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:07,360
He said,

3313
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:07,650
no,

3314
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:07,951
no,

3315
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:08,111
no,

3316
01:29:08,111 --> 01:29:08,680
it won't.

3317
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,513
If that's all,

3318
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:11,530
if it won't collapse,

3319
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:14,230
does that mean my eyes in more danger on?

3320
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,233
And he said,

3321
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:15,880
wow,

3322
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,220
I would have fired if I was you.

3323
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:18,750
I know folks like that.

3324
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:20,570
Well he wouldn't fight
if he was you anyway.

3325
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:21,541
That's how I fall off.

3326
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:21,651
Well,

3327
01:29:21,651 --> 01:29:23,990
what fucking stupid thing to say.

3328
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,010
If you were,

3329
01:29:25,011 --> 01:29:26,030
if it was you,

3330
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:27,050
you would not know.

3331
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:27,913
So I said to him,

3332
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:28,753
is it safe?

3333
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:29,570
And he said,

3334
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:30,260
if I would do,

3335
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:31,040
I would have,

3336
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:31,873
I wouldn't fight.

3337
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:32,863
And I fought.

3338
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,800
That's what an answer.

3339
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:35,363
But that's it.

3340
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,130
First of all,

3341
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:37,120
he's being honest,

3342
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:38,140
cause he's not a fighter.

3343
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:38,920
He's a doctor.

3344
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:39,101
Yeah.

3345
01:29:39,101 --> 01:29:41,050
But I don't need his opinion
on fucking everything.

3346
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:42,940
Meniscus surgery.

3347
01:29:42,941 --> 01:29:45,070
And The lady was telling me
never to do Jujitsu again.

3348
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,590
You need to stop just
some meniscus surgery.

3349
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:48,580
What are you talking about?

3350
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:49,270
Oh,

3351
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:50,170
you need to stop.

3352
01:29:50,171 --> 01:29:52,000
You're going to be crippled
by the time you get old,

3353
01:29:52,001 --> 01:29:52,840
your knees won't work.

3354
01:29:52,841 --> 01:29:53,170
You're like,

3355
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:53,740
Whoa,

3356
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:55,150
I have so many arguments.

3357
01:29:55,151 --> 01:29:59,320
We doctors about storage and things
like that because they don't know.

3358
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:01,830
You tried to get prescriptions and
that's like a little mark right here

3359
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,370
in my back.

3360
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,553
I

3361
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:07,391
go to Mexico,

3362
01:30:07,391 --> 01:30:07,740
man.

3363
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:08,573
Super easy.

3364
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:08,991
No,

3365
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:09,330
no,

3366
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:10,380
the Boba tea.

3367
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,730
So many arguments because the event,

3368
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:14,100
like I said,

3369
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,090
they don't actually,

3370
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:18,150
they see a lot of the negative effects
and they don't actually know what they're

3371
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:18,984
talking about.

3372
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:19,620
Well,

3373
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:19,920
there's,

3374
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:24,920
there's an issue with a lot of doctors
when it comes to two areas and one of a

3375
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:30,410
big one is nutrition is a real issue
with a lot of doctors that are really not

3376
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:35,760
that much more informed than the lay
person when it comes to nutrition.

3377
01:30:35,761 --> 01:30:40,560
If you're the average person that reads
an article or two here and there about

3378
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:42,900
the benefits of vitamin C or you know,

3379
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:45,270
Alpha lipoic acid or whatever
the fuck you read about,

3380
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:49,990
you probably know as much as your
average general practitioner.

3381
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,700
They don't really know that
much about nutrition on average.

3382
01:30:53,701 --> 01:30:54,860
I mean there's the course,

3383
01:30:54,861 --> 01:30:59,861
there's exceptions to the rule and
when you're dealing with something,

3384
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:00,360
uh,

3385
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,410
like nutrition,

3386
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,280
which is,

3387
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,061
you know,

3388
01:31:03,061 --> 01:31:06,150
an integral part of your
health in the first place.

3389
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:11,300
It's a weird thing when the
doctors are only like their,

3390
01:31:11,301 --> 01:31:12,540
their idea of wellness,

3391
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:14,730
there's only taking care of
you but actually are broken.

3392
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:18,450
It's not like completely stopping all
this shit from happening in the first

3393
01:31:18,451 --> 01:31:22,920
place and like stepping in
and giving you nutrition and

3394
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:26,310
picks up.

3395
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:27,480
But then again,

3396
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:31,260
they have to understand that the
body is a finite proposition.

3397
01:31:31,261 --> 01:31:32,970
And if a man wants to be a fighter,

3398
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:36,190
then you've got to patch them back up
and send them out there and it says

3399
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,043
decisions.

3400
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:40,140
I wouldn't fight it if I was you,

3401
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,210
but he's an and you,

3402
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:42,900
yeah.

3403
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,460
You wouldn't be a doctor
if you are him when Alpha.

3404
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,313
I was like,

3405
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:47,753
Oh

3406
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:50,130
yeah,

3407
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:50,551
there's,

3408
01:31:50,551 --> 01:31:51,384
um,

3409
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:52,560
is there,

3410
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,393
uh,

3411
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:55,650
a point where you think,

3412
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:56,011
like,

3413
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,240
if you look at like your career,

3414
01:31:57,241 --> 01:31:58,380
like if you look at your future,

3415
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,350
if you,

3416
01:31:59,350 --> 01:31:59,551
we,

3417
01:31:59,551 --> 01:31:59,801
we,

3418
01:31:59,801 --> 01:32:00,160
you say,

3419
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:00,281
well,

3420
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:00,520
okay,

3421
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,630
well if I get to this point,

3422
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,180
no,

3423
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:03,900
no,

3424
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:07,630
you just can do it and to enjoy it
while I stopped enjoying it for years.

3425
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,030
I fucking hate it for four years,

3426
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:10,270
four,

3427
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:12,880
five years when I start gambling.

3428
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:14,103
Um,

3429
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:15,370
and then I've met,

3430
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:16,204
I hate it.

3431
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:19,270
I'd have like little spells
where I would be like,

3432
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:20,840
oh,

3433
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:21,673
I can't do it anymore.

3434
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:23,800
I don't want to the pressure,

3435
01:32:23,801 --> 01:32:26,720
the fucking head fuck of it all the best.

3436
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,960
And then when I get my money
and money gambling it all,

3437
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:30,101
I've just,

3438
01:32:30,101 --> 01:32:30,934
uh,

3439
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:31,751
you know,

3440
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:32,584
I mean,

3441
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:38,290
I can't do it anymore and I can't keep
bringing myself back up like Kimball,

3442
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,150
who was meant to be a big comeback,

3443
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:40,980
uh,

3444
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,270
the put genetically,

3445
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,150
you know,

3446
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:43,983
keep it going.

3447
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:44,950
Does that,

3448
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:45,600
you know,

3449
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,600
bought a bean that bollock just a lot
of bad decisions and so by me as well,

3450
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,090
but not just so,

3451
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,640
not just bad decisions,

3452
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:56,240
just bad results.

3453
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:57,070
Well,

3454
01:32:57,070 --> 01:33:00,220
but results are some
caused by me and some,

3455
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,640
some just bad decisions.

3456
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:02,500
I mean,

3457
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,680
it's not just the Kimball
was seen by how many people,

3458
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:07,420
they must say there was a huge audience.

3459
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:08,254
Right.

3460
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,611
8 million people,

3461
01:33:09,611 --> 01:33:11,440
I think six or eight.

3462
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:12,274
I can't remember.

3463
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:13,960
I most people,

3464
01:33:13,961 --> 01:33:17,650
what they remember is that you came into
the cage with a fucking mouse living in

3465
01:33:17,651 --> 01:33:18,484
your hair.

3466
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,020
You had a like a whole
mouse family and it blew up,

3467
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:23,470
right?

3468
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:23,810
Yeah.

3469
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:25,230
It popped in the middle of the fight.

3470
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,100
It was so hard to watch.

3471
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:30,430
That was the most fucked up
ear ever seen on national TV.

3472
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:31,540
No one had a more fucked up.

3473
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:32,050
Your Mri.

3474
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:33,010
My is from a famous,

3475
01:33:33,011 --> 01:33:33,371
I'm man,

3476
01:33:33,371 --> 01:33:34,140
I'm jealous.

3477
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:34,811
I'm jealous on my,

3478
01:33:34,811 --> 01:33:35,460
Eh.

3479
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:38,140
We'll talk about that fight when we
were that guy that fuck Kimbo what?

3480
01:33:38,141 --> 01:33:39,280
The crazy fucking ear.

3481
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,330
Oh Shit.

3482
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:41,050
Yeah.

3483
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:41,883
Colossus.

3484
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,510
I'm not going to be remembered.

3485
01:33:43,511 --> 01:33:44,980
Fall out though for that.

3486
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:45,400
No.

3487
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:45,920
Wow.

3488
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,440
You'll,

3489
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:49,220
you'll be remembered for
your entire career of sure.

3490
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:49,620
No,

3491
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:50,453
what I'm saying,

3492
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,600
don't know what I'm saying is the moment,

3493
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:54,360
the moment.

3494
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,640
And people would say,

3495
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:58,043
I'm the Kimball.

3496
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:59,080
You know what I remember,

3497
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:02,090
I remember you had Kimbo in side
control and they stood you up.

3498
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:03,100
Yeah.

3499
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:03,381
Yeah.

3500
01:34:03,381 --> 01:34:03,820
You know,

3501
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:04,690
I remember that,

3502
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:05,913
right.

3503
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:07,530
Nobody had the point side.

3504
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:08,713
I always say this,

3505
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,060
I,

3506
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,570
I take a lot of mold not
changing the fucking paper.

3507
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:14,920
You don't stand as a guy up when the guy,

3508
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:16,893
yeah.

3509
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:17,370
Yeah.

3510
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:19,840
[inaudible] was a corrupt organization.

3511
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:21,390
Corrupt one of them.

3512
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,290
They changed the rules.

3513
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,870
They told guys to stand up and bang.

3514
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:28,170
They told guys stand up and bang.

3515
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:30,730
They gave them instructions and they made,

3516
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:33,220
they made the referee
stand guys up much earlier.

3517
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:38,620
Big country was fighting Andrea
[inaudible] and had him in a fucking side

3518
01:34:38,621 --> 01:34:41,950
control position working a
Komora and they stood in backup.

3519
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:42,611
I'm like,

3520
01:34:42,611 --> 01:34:44,410
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

3521
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:45,611
Jake shields is,

3522
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:47,710
they did that same shit
when he was fighting Paul.

3523
01:34:47,711 --> 01:34:48,240
Um,

3524
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:49,110
uh,

3525
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,250
Semtex when he's fighting Paul Daley,

3526
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:52,061
same shit.

3527
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:52,930
They tried to stand them up.

3528
01:34:52,931 --> 01:34:53,171
Rarely,

3529
01:34:53,171 --> 01:34:54,370
but Jake just attack,

3530
01:34:54,371 --> 01:34:54,731
attack,

3531
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:56,200
attack and got him in an arm bar.

3532
01:34:56,201 --> 01:34:57,990
He just went Jake's high level black

3533
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,191
belt.

3534
01:34:58,191 --> 01:34:59,630
So he just went after it really quickly.

3535
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:02,810
But you had Kimbo in fucking side control.

3536
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:03,800
You work to get it.

3537
01:35:03,801 --> 01:35:04,251
You got it.

3538
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:05,420
You are a dominant position.

3539
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:09,980
He was tired and they
stood you back up bitches.

3540
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:11,850
We did a um,

3541
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,320
a video interview,

3542
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:13,950
you know,

3543
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:17,340
everyone's on the other line and I've
just finished training so I'm on the

3544
01:35:17,341 --> 01:35:17,890
phone,

3545
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:18,280
I want to,

3546
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,160
no one was asking me
fucking any questions.

3547
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,293
Um,

3548
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:22,080
and I thought,

3549
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:22,321
yeah,

3550
01:35:22,321 --> 01:35:24,900
I'm just the Guy Kimbo to be so,

3551
01:35:24,901 --> 01:35:26,760
and then the someone
else go short question.

3552
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:29,820
They said this is how he
was holding the phone.

3553
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:30,943
Um,

3554
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:35,050
the Afghan show of the questions
that I had it ever since.

3555
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:36,630
So just in case you can visualize it,

3556
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:38,153
they said to him,

3557
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,440
what would you do with James Thomson One?

3558
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:41,160
And he said,

3559
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,060
I'd hung myself.

3560
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,433
And I thought,

3561
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,340
wow,

3562
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:50,220
that's the dumbest motherfucker
in the history of MMA productions.

3563
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:55,700
The idea that you have one guy that's
the most important thing and banking

3564
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:56,880
everything on him winning.

3565
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,940
So stupid eggs,

3566
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,300
culturally domino.

3567
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,250
If you kicked that guy's ass,

3568
01:36:02,251 --> 01:36:06,510
it would have been awesome if
they left you in side control.

3569
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:07,344
It have been awesome.

3570
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:09,510
Just like it was awesome
for him when he won,

3571
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,040
it would have been awesome for you.

3572
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:11,700
Then.

3573
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:12,480
You know,

3574
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:16,320
you got to let the guy who's supposed
to win win when you're trying to just be

3575
01:36:16,321 --> 01:36:17,460
the most marketable.

3576
01:36:17,461 --> 01:36:19,470
You're like looking for
the most marketable guy.

3577
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,750
You'd never going to have
a legit organization.

3578
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,860
His organization,

3579
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,430
his whole organization was,

3580
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,430
it was essentially a corrupt organization.

3581
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:27,290
That's,

3582
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:28,123
that's what that is.

3583
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:29,510
Uh,

3584
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:30,343
um,

3585
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:32,470
I'm writing a book at the
moment because the blogs,

3586
01:36:32,471 --> 01:36:33,340
I've gone so well,

3587
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:35,050
I felt to himself,

3588
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:38,260
I've got a fucking a lot beside
looking back at the different stories,

3589
01:36:38,261 --> 01:36:41,260
can I take the federal drinking
water and everyone loved it.

3590
01:36:41,261 --> 01:36:42,700
And a few more.

3591
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:43,421
So I started thinking,

3592
01:36:43,421 --> 01:36:44,254
I've got fucking

3593
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:44,450
that,

3594
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:49,430
that [inaudible] stories are
very important story from
martial arts because that

3595
01:36:49,431 --> 01:36:50,360
made me angry.

3596
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:52,190
I was watching that at
home and I was angry.

3597
01:36:52,191 --> 01:36:52,461
I was like,

3598
01:36:52,461 --> 01:36:53,151
this is crazy.

3599
01:36:53,151 --> 01:36:54,170
And I love Kimbo.

3600
01:36:54,171 --> 01:36:55,230
I think he's an awesome guy.

3601
01:36:55,231 --> 01:36:55,580
Yeah,

3602
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:56,720
he's a great character.

3603
01:36:56,721 --> 01:36:57,980
I like watching him fight.

3604
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:00,420
He won a boxing match recently.

3605
01:37:00,421 --> 01:37:01,730
He's been winning a lot of boxing matches.

3606
01:37:01,731 --> 01:37:02,564
I love that dude.

3607
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:04,850
It's not that I wanted
him to win or you to win,

3608
01:37:04,851 --> 01:37:06,260
but I wanted fairness.

3609
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:09,830
And you worked hard to get
to that position and you
were in a dominant position

3610
01:37:09,831 --> 01:37:12,800
and they stood you back up and you were
fucking tired and you've got cracked.

3611
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:17,060
And they did the same thing with big
country when big country had our Lawsky

3612
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:17,810
down.

3613
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:20,480
He was working for a fucking
Komora and they stood him up.

3614
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:20,721
I'm like,

3615
01:37:20,721 --> 01:37:22,310
are you crazy?

3616
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,173
It was quite have on it.

3617
01:37:23,190 --> 01:37:23,540
Well,

3618
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:23,970
um,

3619
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:28,500
I watched 'em big country and he was
almost in exactly the same position as me

3620
01:37:28,501 --> 01:37:30,450
when he beat Kimball on the,

3621
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:30,901
with the,

3622
01:37:30,901 --> 01:37:31,640
yeah.

3623
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:32,473
And I felt,

3624
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,270
uh,

3625
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:34,103
you know,

3626
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:35,490
kind of not mentioned or no,

3627
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,440
I'm very close to the same position,

3628
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:37,831
you know what I mean?

3629
01:37:37,831 --> 01:37:39,270
The only difference is he
went with the mountain.

3630
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,280
He had a full amount of crucifix on by,

3631
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:43,530
which I'm sure you could
have worked towards.

3632
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:44,610
You had them on his back.

3633
01:37:44,611 --> 01:37:45,840
He was only going to get more tired.

3634
01:37:45,841 --> 01:37:47,130
There was a couple minutes to go right.

3635
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:47,760
The thing without

3636
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,210
fine.

3637
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:51,420
It's not that I think they should have
stopped the fight for because he came

3638
01:37:51,421 --> 01:37:52,151
back and yet,

3639
01:37:52,151 --> 01:37:53,110
and he was Adam.

3640
01:37:53,111 --> 01:37:54,270
He rocked in the third round.

3641
01:37:54,271 --> 01:37:55,330
He didn't fucking up,

3642
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,020
but I'm punches.

3643
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:57,730
Um,

3644
01:37:57,730 --> 01:37:58,390
and I was,

3645
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:59,050
I was walked.

3646
01:37:59,050 --> 01:37:59,883
So it's not bad,

3647
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:02,580
but they should have sent
you might not me out.

3648
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:03,783
I don't know.

3649
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:04,683
I know man.

3650
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,280
I took him down.

3651
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:07,353
Right.

3652
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:09,450
I don't know who the warm right.

3653
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:10,181
That's the fucking,

3654
01:38:10,181 --> 01:38:11,260
the point of the fight.

3655
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:13,390
You've got to let the fight you include.

3656
01:38:13,570 --> 01:38:14,440
He could've knocked me out.

3657
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:15,610
Make Cause I was,

3658
01:38:15,610 --> 01:38:17,450
I was about one more take down and he,

3659
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:18,363
and he was mine.

3660
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:22,620
Will you take such a good shot and you
take so many shots that sometimes people

3661
01:38:22,621 --> 01:38:23,730
don't know what the fuck to do.

3662
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:25,020
And I think a fight like that,

3663
01:38:25,021 --> 01:38:28,440
like you took some bombs from
Kimbo and you were still there.

3664
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:29,660
And it's like the referees,

3665
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:29,881
like,

3666
01:38:29,881 --> 01:38:30,151
man,

3667
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:31,500
do I rescue this fucking guy?

3668
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:36,510
It's a weird judgment call and it's very
important to have the right referee in

3669
01:38:36,511 --> 01:38:37,500
a situation like that.

3670
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:38,880
Like a guy like herb dean,

3671
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:39,750
he'll,

3672
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:40,860
he'll let you fight,

3673
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,230
he'll let you fight if he,

3674
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:45,150
but he will save you if
he knows you're fucked,

3675
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:45,841
you know?

3676
01:38:45,841 --> 01:38:46,201
And that,

3677
01:38:46,201 --> 01:38:49,770
that I think there's a lot of fights
where the referee errs on the side of

3678
01:38:49,771 --> 01:38:51,450
caution and protects the fighter.

3679
01:38:51,451 --> 01:38:53,250
And in a case like yours,

3680
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:55,500
you feel like you were denied
an opportunity because of that.

3681
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:55,651
Right,

3682
01:38:55,651 --> 01:38:55,800
right.

3683
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:55,890
Well,

3684
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:56,723
yeah.

3685
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:58,710
Well what I was saying before,

3686
01:38:58,711 --> 01:38:59,150
so I was,

3687
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:00,060
I take van Berlin,

3688
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,273
but the,

3689
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,300
I was backstage and it,

3690
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:05,940
it just happened and I'm Gary Shaw Son,

3691
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:06,810
um,

3692
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:07,643
that fucking

3693
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:13,650
Scala Skala what seems like
a nice guy with a fucking

3694
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:18,900
dollar sign fucking is a
chain of dark side chain.

3695
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:21,830
Yeah.

3696
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:22,663
It's clever.

3697
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,040
Yeah.

3698
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,830
Well he grew up with the
rich dad and he both,

3699
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:26,640
you know,

3700
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,140
it's an interesting way to live your life,

3701
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:30,300
but he came up to me and he said,

3702
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,340
you've got to go to the hospital.

3703
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:33,600
You've got to do it well to the hospital.

3704
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:35,520
Now I know you've got
to go to the hospital.

3705
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:36,493
Yeah.

3706
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:38,070
I turned to him and I said,

3707
01:39:38,071 --> 01:39:38,904
yeah.

3708
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:40,090
I said,

3709
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:40,923
yeah,

3710
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,020
but it turned her away or you know,

3711
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,280
cause there was a lot going on,

3712
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,513
so didn't hit me.

3713
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:47,010
Then he turned back and went,

3714
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,900
you have to go to the hospital
now I'm taking you now and I,

3715
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:53,830
you really want me to go
to the hospital right.

3716
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:55,733
Too much.

3717
01:39:56,040 --> 01:40:00,060
So then I went to the press conference
instead and as I walked into the patch

3718
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:00,890
conference,

3719
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:01,190
Garrett,

3720
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:02,023
y'all was going,

3721
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:05,400
we've just have to take James
Thompson to the hospital.

3722
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:06,793
The

3723
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:08,780
breathing to the,

3724
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:13,620
I'm someone caught into it and I was
drinking their drink and I think out some

3725
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,890
old man then that sums it all up there.

3726
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:16,733
Correct.

3727
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:17,930
You know what I mean?

3728
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:18,201
Yeah.

3729
01:40:18,201 --> 01:40:19,670
That's a corrupt organization.

3730
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:20,720
That's horse shit.

3731
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:23,960
They're pretending you were hurt
more than you were to pump Kimbo up.

3732
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:24,470
Yeah.

3733
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:25,430
Wow.

3734
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,750
That's interesting.

3735
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:27,020
Yeah.

3736
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,360
So it was hauling ass stupid
organization that was,

3737
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:29,841
you know,

3738
01:40:29,841 --> 01:40:31,250
I don't make predictions man.

3739
01:40:31,251 --> 01:40:32,840
A very rarely make predictions,

3740
01:40:32,990 --> 01:40:37,950
but one of the predictions that I made
was when a lead XC mixed Seth purchase

3741
01:40:37,951 --> 01:40:38,840
Ellie up with Kimbo.

3742
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:39,410
Okay.

3743
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:39,741
I'm like,

3744
01:40:39,741 --> 01:40:39,861
well,

3745
01:40:39,861 --> 01:40:40,610
come south.

3746
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:42,670
Petrocelli has been around a long time.

3747
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,780
He's a seriously seasoned guy.

3748
01:40:44,781 --> 01:40:45,021
I'm like,

3749
01:40:45,021 --> 01:40:46,220
this is a terrible fight.

3750
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:50,990
I bands heavy hands and
he's very aggressive and
especially in the first round,

3751
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:52,280
like he's gonna come after you,

3752
01:40:52,281 --> 01:40:52,611
man.

3753
01:40:52,611 --> 01:40:52,731
You know,

3754
01:40:52,731 --> 01:40:54,280
he's had a bunch of injuries

3755
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,530
and he's had a long career.

3756
01:40:56,531 --> 01:40:57,610
He's fought a long time.

3757
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,290
But in that fight I was like,

3758
01:40:59,440 --> 01:40:59,830
boy,

3759
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:01,420
I could see that as a mismatch.

3760
01:41:01,421 --> 01:41:03,940
That's a bad fight for Kimbo last minute.

3761
01:41:03,941 --> 01:41:05,380
They are so stupid.

3762
01:41:05,381 --> 01:41:10,090
The way they designed that organization
around one guy who was basically a

3763
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:12,700
really exciting prospect.

3764
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:14,920
He was a really fun guy.

3765
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,390
He had a cool look,

3766
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:16,781
you know,

3767
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:18,250
I'm glad that he made some money.

3768
01:41:18,251 --> 01:41:19,420
I'm glad that he did well,

3769
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:19,871
but the,

3770
01:41:19,871 --> 01:41:22,400
that you would bank at all
and this one guy based on,

3771
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:22,780
no,

3772
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:26,830
you made have him fight guys
too and pump them up to an exam.

3773
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,350
I May.

3774
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:29,860
It's almost unpredictable sport ever.

3775
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:32,110
And now he's fighting boxers and you know,

3776
01:41:32,111 --> 01:41:32,320
I'm,

3777
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,370
I mean he's,

3778
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:35,310
he's got a bunch of knee problems as well.

3779
01:41:35,311 --> 01:41:36,000
So I mean,

3780
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:36,810
he looks,

3781
01:41:36,810 --> 01:41:38,230
I mean the guy who fault,

3782
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,150
I felt the guy was gonna win in the end.

3783
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:42,370
I mean Kimbo did 12 to get the
petitioner shot and finish him.

3784
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:42,731
Oh,

3785
01:41:42,731 --> 01:41:43,750
that was the last boxer.

3786
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:44,291
Yeah.

3787
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:48,260
That guy seemed a bit out of shape
about dangerous man following him,

3788
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:49,541
following him.

3789
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:51,280
And they were both gassed
in the first round.

3790
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,830
We both fucked about sacramental.

3791
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:57,580
He teed off on Kimbo one combination and
Timbo stiffened up towards the end of

3792
01:41:57,581 --> 01:41:57,980
the first.

3793
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:01,990
He got tagged for clean
ones to covered away.

3794
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:03,610
Thought he went for it too.

3795
01:42:03,611 --> 01:42:04,250
I'm the guy,

3796
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:05,140
Ken both did well.

3797
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:06,880
I got that under is finished.

3798
01:42:06,881 --> 01:42:07,920
It will kill.

3799
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:08,441
Recovered.

3800
01:42:08,441 --> 01:42:10,270
Really Nice and a fight that was a,

3801
01:42:10,271 --> 01:42:10,991
that was impressive.

3802
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:12,230
It was obvious that he's shaped,

3803
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:13,601
it was a,

3804
01:42:13,601 --> 01:42:14,470
that was a crazy fight.

3805
01:42:14,471 --> 01:42:14,690
He's an,

3806
01:42:14,690 --> 01:42:15,523
he's an exciting guy.

3807
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,670
It's not that I didn't want him
to win or wanted you to win,

3808
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:20,410
but when they said you guys up,

3809
01:42:20,411 --> 01:42:20,831
I was like,

3810
01:42:20,831 --> 01:42:23,060
you guys are ruining the sport
because that's not the sport though.

3811
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:23,830
I took it to the bank.

3812
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:24,380
Yeah,

3813
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:28,370
you don't know the individual
people have promoters,

3814
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:28,860
man.

3815
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:33,280
The arrogance of those boxing guys to
think that they could just come in and

3816
01:42:33,281 --> 01:42:37,060
just sort of work it the way they've
worked by it shows you how they've worked

3817
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:37,780
box,

3818
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:42,460
how they build up contenders and they're
not concerned as much about what you

3819
01:42:42,461 --> 01:42:45,400
can do as they are about how
much money they can make off you.

3820
01:42:45,401 --> 01:42:49,240
So it's not about we need to test
them against some strong competition.

3821
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,360
It's about let's get him some setup fights
and let's avoid that guy because that

3822
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:54,203
guy will explore.

3823
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:55,000
It's possible.

3824
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:55,151
Yeah,

3825
01:42:55,151 --> 01:42:56,890
I keep it going as long as possible.

3826
01:42:56,891 --> 01:42:58,510
Promoted all yourself.

3827
01:42:58,540 --> 01:42:59,500
Do it all internally.

3828
01:42:59,501 --> 01:43:00,790
This is don king's fighter.

3829
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:01,481
I'm don king,

3830
01:43:01,481 --> 01:43:02,314
the promoter,

3831
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:02,681
and you,

3832
01:43:02,681 --> 01:43:02,921
you know,

3833
01:43:02,921 --> 01:43:04,750
you get it to a point
where the guy's a champion,

3834
01:43:04,751 --> 01:43:07,990
then you fucking Rican into cash while
avoiding the dangerous guy that nobody

3835
01:43:07,991 --> 01:43:09,400
knows that will knock them out.

3836
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,750
It's a fucking rocky movie.

3837
01:43:11,070 --> 01:43:11,903
Uh,

3838
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:13,180
you can give them money.

3839
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:18,210
The money you do make you put to good
use because you fund sucks up career.

3840
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:20,500
Yes.

3841
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:20,980
Who's free?

3842
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:21,813
Who's rap career?

3843
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:23,020
Oh yeah.

3844
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:23,853
Scholar.

3845
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:24,760
So Scott,

3846
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,421
a rap crews.

3847
01:43:25,421 --> 01:43:26,200
You're good rapper.

3848
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,033
Oh my

3849
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:29,070
gosh,

3850
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:29,903
I'm tired.

3851
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:31,983
I just think it's,

3852
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,640
it's,

3853
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,011
it's,

3854
01:43:33,011 --> 01:43:34,240
it's very lucky.

3855
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:37,540
We're all very lucky that
that organization doesn't
operate the way it did.

3856
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,880
And then up Sydney's a,

3857
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,050
if you're not saying these video,

3858
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:42,123
no,

3859
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:43,150
those are real rap video.

3860
01:43:43,151 --> 01:43:43,550
Yeah.

3861
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:45,610
I said I don't make fun of the guy.

3862
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:46,444
He's a young guy,

3863
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,940
but he grew up with a
wacky dude for a dad.

3864
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:49,260
I mean,

3865
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,380
if that's your dad,

3866
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,250
what the fuck?

3867
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:52,090
I'd be a Douche bag

3868
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:52,360
too.

3869
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:53,193
That was my dad's.

3870
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,460
How the fuck am I going to turn out?

3871
01:43:54,461 --> 01:43:55,980
This is my role model here.

3872
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:56,320
Well,

3873
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:56,680
yeah,

3874
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,240
I mean you don't have to tonight like,

3875
01:43:58,390 --> 01:43:59,223
yeah.

3876
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:01,060
In a young guy,

3877
01:44:01,061 --> 01:44:01,330
right?

3878
01:44:01,330 --> 01:44:01,600
Yeah.

3879
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:06,450
Cause I mean like my mom had a
terrible upbringing and cheap,

3880
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:07,473
the best ever.

3881
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:08,420
Jeremy.

3882
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,240
It sometimes works the opposite.

3883
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:12,293
It's how to say his name.

3884
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:13,143
I know what you mean.

3885
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:14,260
Playing the odds.

3886
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:15,213
Generally.

3887
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:16,930
Gary Shaw's your dad.

3888
01:44:16,931 --> 01:44:17,410
Yeah.

3889
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:18,243
I'm going to be an asshole.

3890
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,770
Jen Yama Gemini.

3891
01:44:20,771 --> 01:44:21,250
I am.

3892
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:21,461
Yeah.

3893
01:44:21,461 --> 01:44:21,881
I'm a Jew.

3894
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:23,740
Harbor resentment from them after that,

3895
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:25,380
when you knew that they
had stood there fighting.

3896
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:26,710
I,

3897
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:27,543
I did.

3898
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:28,423
Um,

3899
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:29,273
I did,

3900
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:31,190
I used that in the wrong way,

3901
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:32,390
the wrong way.

3902
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:34,200
I act and I thought fuck it.

3903
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:37,460
And then the blockhead dumb Merkley I to,

3904
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:40,310
he fucked up from my mate most in,

3905
01:44:40,311 --> 01:44:40,880
uh,

3906
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,340
he was roughing him.

3907
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:44,900
I'm co poked most of the eye and most,

3908
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:45,340
well,

3909
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:45,531
uh,

3910
01:44:45,531 --> 01:44:46,730
and then who was it?

3911
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:47,210
Um,

3912
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,080
most of took,

3913
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:50,990
he,

3914
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:51,300
he,

3915
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:52,133
he uh,

3916
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:57,160
he got poked in the eye by call cop and
then he didn't stop the fight and I was

3917
01:44:57,211 --> 01:44:57,360
like,

3918
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,980
you fucking prick.

3919
01:44:59,070 --> 01:45:00,120
You know why?

3920
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:04,200
Merga layout is the same one
that stood you up on with Kimbo.

3921
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,950
Yeah.

3922
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:05,280
Yes.

3923
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:05,761
The same one.

3924
01:45:05,761 --> 01:45:06,760
We're all laughing.

3925
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:09,930
They instructed them all to do that,

3926
01:45:09,931 --> 01:45:10,231
right?

3927
01:45:10,231 --> 01:45:11,460
Didn't they instruct the reference?

3928
01:45:12,110 --> 01:45:12,943
I don't.

3929
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,090
That's a really tricky
situation and that's where,

3930
01:45:15,091 --> 01:45:15,251
you know,

3931
01:45:15,251 --> 01:45:17,250
it was a very famous clip of Dana White,

3932
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:18,930
like yelling at the camera going,

3933
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:22,500
that's fucking illegal
because that kind of shit,

3934
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:24,870
you can alter the course of a fight.

3935
01:45:24,871 --> 01:45:27,630
And one of the reasons why it's
illegal because people bet on fights,

3936
01:45:27,810 --> 01:45:27,970
you know?

3937
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:30,750
So you're essentially the Vegas,

3938
01:45:30,751 --> 01:45:31,261
it's legal.

3939
01:45:31,261 --> 01:45:31,561
Okay,

3940
01:45:31,561 --> 01:45:31,981
so you're,

3941
01:45:31,981 --> 01:45:33,120
you're fixing that fight.

3942
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:36,690
If you're telling a guy that
he asked to go to the ground,

3943
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,021
you know,

3944
01:45:37,021 --> 01:45:38,850
or you're telling you the
guy that he has to stand up,

3945
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,241
you're,

3946
01:45:39,241 --> 01:45:40,500
you're altering what,

3947
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:43,650
what he would or wouldn't have
done independently on his own.

3948
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,100
You're essentially fixing the fine.

3949
01:45:46,150 --> 01:45:47,300
You believe if interviewed,

3950
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:48,420
even if you're wrong,

3951
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:49,440
you're attempting it.

3952
01:45:49,470 --> 01:45:53,670
And it should be illegal to have any
influence whatsoever on how the guy

3953
01:45:53,671 --> 01:45:56,430
performs in any other way
other than just saying,

3954
01:45:56,431 --> 01:45:57,240
hey man,

3955
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:00,100
this is your best bet to
win this fight or clothes.

3956
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:02,130
Anything else you tell them like,

3957
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:04,380
what are you doing the fuck are you doing?

3958
01:46:04,530 --> 01:46:04,731
You're,

3959
01:46:04,731 --> 01:46:07,080
you're influencing the possible result,

3960
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:08,610
especially if you're a promoter.

3961
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:09,231
So for,

3962
01:46:09,231 --> 01:46:09,871
is it promoted?

3963
01:46:09,871 --> 01:46:11,820
It tells a referee they've
got to stand people up early.

3964
01:46:11,821 --> 01:46:12,980
That guy should be in jail.

3965
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:13,300
Yeah,

3966
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:13,850
the the out.

3967
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:14,630
Um,

3968
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:14,931
I mean,

3969
01:46:14,931 --> 01:46:16,100
I don't want to go into too much.

3970
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:16,700
Well,

3971
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,100
the judge who's I found
out the second round,

3972
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:19,991
all the treasury,

3973
01:46:19,991 --> 01:46:21,440
Scottish ten nine to me,

3974
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:22,453
the first phone,

3975
01:46:22,990 --> 01:46:23,670
the sacrament,

3976
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:24,111
it was 10,

3977
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:24,410
eight,

3978
01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:29,260
ten eight and then gallery shawls mate
who lives down the volt phone who go

3979
01:46:29,261 --> 01:46:31,940
shell was on the New
Jersey Athletic Commission.

3980
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,860
That Guy Scott,

3981
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,260
ten eight Kimball that second round.

3982
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:37,363
Whoa.

3983
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:38,660
Yeah.

3984
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:39,493
Wow.

3985
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:40,580
So you know,

3986
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,640
just corrupt.

3987
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:42,000
Yeah.

3988
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,210
Light.

3989
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:47,210
He's hates corruption and the aids and
he bought by the override it ten nine to

3990
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:48,453
me.

3991
01:46:48,690 --> 01:46:49,030
I,

3992
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:49,863
I think

3993
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,050
there's a lot of salt though.

3994
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:51,511
Just like,

3995
01:46:51,511 --> 01:46:53,310
just flip a coin at the
end of a round two though,

3996
01:46:53,311 --> 01:46:58,311
there's a lot of bad refereeing and MMA
or bad judging may more bad judging.

3997
01:46:59,311 --> 01:47:00,101
I think then referee,

3998
01:47:00,101 --> 01:47:01,410
there's a lot of really good referees,

3999
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:05,910
but there's some standout bad judges
that keep turning in to like bad decision

4000
01:47:05,911 --> 01:47:06,830
after bad decision.

4001
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,340
They're like,

4002
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:08,610
you're crazy.

4003
01:47:08,611 --> 01:47:10,380
Like how do you see that fight like that?

4004
01:47:10,381 --> 01:47:11,550
Like that's nuts.

4005
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:12,440
It's fucking nuts.

4006
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:13,710
So many of them,

4007
01:47:13,711 --> 01:47:15,900
there's so fucking many of them.

4008
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:16,711
There's a lot,

4009
01:47:16,711 --> 01:47:17,790
a lot of bad,

4010
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:19,380
bad judging going on.

4011
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:23,400
It's just doesn't make any sense to me
that you're talking about a sport that's

4012
01:47:23,401 --> 01:47:26,400
one of the most popular sports
at this point in the world.

4013
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:27,263
Okay.

4014
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:32,960
One of the most dangerous and one
of the sports that requires the most

4015
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:37,860
commitment out of the athlete because
you're not just putting your physical body

4016
01:47:37,861 --> 01:47:38,400
on the line.

4017
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,830
You're putting your emotional wellbeing,

4018
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:42,390
how you feel about life.

4019
01:47:42,391 --> 01:47:45,630
You're putting a lot of shit on
the line and you are not partying.

4020
01:47:45,631 --> 01:47:46,331
You're not you.

4021
01:47:46,331 --> 01:47:46,770
You are.

4022
01:47:46,770 --> 01:47:51,770
You got to fine tune your weapon over
the course of eight weeks of long,

4023
01:47:52,861 --> 01:47:53,401
hard,

4024
01:47:53,401 --> 01:47:58,401
grueling fucking train and to have all
that judged by someone who's just totally

4025
01:47:59,491 --> 01:48:04,491
incompetent and is completely add
the loop as far as like transitions,

4026
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,080
techniques,

4027
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:08,820
the benefit of being in certain places,

4028
01:48:08,821 --> 01:48:10,410
the benefit of holding certain positions.

4029
01:48:10,411 --> 01:48:10,670
How do you,

4030
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:15,450
how do you score round subjectively
when you're looking at like all the

4031
01:48:15,451 --> 01:48:17,190
different things that happen in the round.

4032
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,620
If you don't know which ones are good,

4033
01:48:20,130 --> 01:48:21,750
how do you score that round?

4034
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:22,720
What do you,

4035
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,553
you just,

4036
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:25,470
it's like you said it before,

4037
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:30,530
but the system and that is an everything
you see that I went to a wrestling show

4038
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:31,770
vastly show.

4039
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:32,610
I went to like some,

4040
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:33,120
uh,

4041
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:34,590
my mate was wrestling Greco.

4042
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:36,660
I'm freestyle asking like papa wrestling.

4043
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,210
So he went not on the people.

4044
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:40,050
Um,

4045
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:42,790
I had a mate who's freestyle wrestler.

4046
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,190
He wanted the Commonwealth Goldfinger
and he slapped the prospect.

4047
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,130
Now we at the Olympics,

4048
01:48:47,150 --> 01:48:49,120
didn't wear the vessel.

4049
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:54,160
Veselin bold them old fuckers who
battled a day in their life had free

4050
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:55,673
wildcards.

4051
01:48:55,890 --> 01:48:56,723
One of them.

4052
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:00,000
They're used for a woman who's a Russian

4053
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,540
and the overtake Russian woman wrestler.

4054
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:04,050
Yeah,

4055
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:04,530
but the color,

4056
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:06,690
but the color all of a sudden I'm hard.

4057
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:10,560
I'm sure the bed she
had to to bed as well.

4058
01:49:10,561 --> 01:49:13,230
Of course she had a period Russian woman.

4059
01:49:13,231 --> 01:49:14,064
I heard you.

4060
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:16,410
But the um,

4061
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:17,470
the two of us,

4062
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:20,060
the two of a wildcard,

4063
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:22,260
she was saying use thinking
about any bridge people.

4064
01:49:22,261 --> 01:49:23,560
My Main Leon Volvo's,

4065
01:49:24,670 --> 01:49:29,370
it'd be like you say after that point
reminded me when you said it'd be

4066
01:49:29,371 --> 01:49:30,720
investing since he was a kid.

4067
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:33,540
All the way you get the Olympics,

4068
01:49:33,541 --> 01:49:37,110
he's going to go and they don't use one
of the wildcards just don't use him.

4069
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,273
Why?

4070
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:39,630
He said unbelievable.

4071
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:40,590
Well,

4072
01:49:40,590 --> 01:49:42,250
there's a lot of corruption in sports.

4073
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:44,060
Think not even pop the Olympic town.

4074
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:44,290
Yeah,

4075
01:49:44,290 --> 01:49:44,941
that's crazy.

4076
01:49:44,941 --> 01:49:48,430
That's the newest thing to happen
is that the Olympic Committee,

4077
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:50,710
which has um,

4078
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:51,790
figure skating,

4079
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:52,510
right.

4080
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:55,000
Isn't that in there you might
eat synchronized swimming,

4081
01:49:55,001 --> 01:49:55,930
synchronized swimming,

4082
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:56,810
ping pong,

4083
01:49:56,810 --> 01:49:58,030
fucking no rumble,

4084
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:58,873
humble,

4085
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,180
all which are fine to Prac.

4086
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:01,361
Yeah,

4087
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:01,610
of course.

4088
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:04,360
You enjoy doing the
decathlon good at home.

4089
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:09,630
The idea that you can't have
wrestling in the Olympics.

4090
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:13,500
The Olympics is based on,

4091
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:16,630
it's one of the most
important sports in MMA.

4092
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,340
You see on the most important,

4093
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,200
the most important weapon in Mia.

4094
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:24,310
The is the ability to control whether
or not a fight stays up or on the ground

4095
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:24,851
that you,

4096
01:50:24,851 --> 01:50:25,960
if you're the better wrestler,

4097
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:30,070
you can dictate one of the most important
aspects of fighting the fight takes.

4098
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,710
And if you can enforce your game plan,

4099
01:50:33,530 --> 01:50:34,870
you're very likely to win.

4100
01:50:34,871 --> 01:50:36,340
Forget about MMA,

4101
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:37,780
forget about MMA.

4102
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:43,030
Wrestling for kids is one of the best
tools for character development of young

4103
01:50:43,031 --> 01:50:47,830
athletes because it is fucking brutal
and it's really about heart and

4104
01:50:47,831 --> 01:50:49,810
determination and it becomes about,

4105
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:53,170
it becomes about your
will to push forward.

4106
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:57,700
You're will to to make sure that you put
in the miles in the morning so that in

4107
01:50:57,701 --> 01:51:02,170
that second period you're the one who has
more energy and you get to take out to

4108
01:51:02,171 --> 01:51:02,980
Bolton.

4109
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:03,311
Yeah,

4110
01:51:03,311 --> 01:51:06,070
there's so it's setting
goals and achieving goals.

4111
01:51:06,071 --> 01:51:10,810
Competition without worrying about like
getting knocked unconscious like boxing

4112
01:51:10,811 --> 01:51:12,850
competition or martial arts competition.

4113
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,510
It's one of the most grueling
ways to test yourself,

4114
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,980
but that they're doing that.

4115
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:19,361
And Th th th the,

4116
01:51:19,361 --> 01:51:24,280
and I find that crazy building
a world full of posters.

4117
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:26,410
We are building a world full of pussies.

4118
01:51:26,411 --> 01:51:26,951
We really are.

4119
01:51:26,951 --> 01:51:30,100
And the crazy thing is when a guy like
you says that they look at you and go,

4120
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:30,740
this is fucking,

4121
01:51:30,740 --> 01:51:33,700
meathead wants everybody to be a
fight in the streets and not us.

4122
01:51:33,701 --> 01:51:34,330
No.

4123
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:38,980
But there's a benefit to
character development that
a lot of people are missing.

4124
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:42,910
And it's one of the reasons our world
is so conti is because men don't have to

4125
01:51:42,911 --> 01:51:43,640
be men anymore.

4126
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,040
You don't have to develop character.

4127
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:49,870
You don't have any like
real good feel like the,

4128
01:51:49,871 --> 01:51:49,991
the,

4129
01:51:49,991 --> 01:51:50,320
the,

4130
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:54,700
the way you carry yourself and the way
you live your life and the way you stand

4131
01:51:54,701 --> 01:51:58,900
up for things and the way you sort
of carve out your own destiny.

4132
01:51:59,140 --> 01:51:59,530
That's,

4133
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:02,530
that's a part that's a
whole part of being a man.

4134
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:07,720
And you benefit from any
test that your will gets.

4135
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:12,280
You benefit from any new experiences
you can take on the situation.

4136
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:14,780
Fucking bullet ants.

4137
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:18,730
I think they're just don't
have the Internet yet.

4138
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:20,440
They have the Internet.

4139
01:52:20,441 --> 01:52:21,430
They would cut that shit.

4140
01:52:21,431 --> 01:52:22,264
Right.

4141
01:52:22,710 --> 01:52:24,410
I'd just be jerking off all the,

4142
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:26,530
if you gave the Amazon
people the Internet,

4143
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:26,921
they'd be like,

4144
01:52:26,921 --> 01:52:27,100
oh,

4145
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:28,360
get all those bitches suck in fall,

4146
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:28,981
fall apart.

4147
01:52:28,981 --> 01:52:30,290
You mind with the fucking glove off?

4148
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:30,590
No,

4149
01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:31,870
no la be painful.

4150
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:32,321
Yeah.

4151
01:52:32,321 --> 01:52:36,040
You'd be really gangster if you jerk
off with a bulletproof bullet ant glove,

4152
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:40,800
the next pass and that,

4153
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:41,913
no,

4154
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:46,980
not been a fan for
season for Adam Carolla.

4155
01:52:47,490 --> 01:52:48,323
The new hook.

4156
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:48,791
Yeah.

4157
01:52:48,791 --> 01:52:49,620
The um,

4158
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,010
the,

4159
01:52:50,010 --> 01:52:50,710
the note,

4160
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:55,150
there's no way you could survive more
than a hundred bullet ants on your Dick.

4161
01:52:55,630 --> 01:52:59,290
I think you would just die even before
just knowing you have to do that task is

4162
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,513
dying.

4163
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:02,083
The transplant.

4164
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:03,090
Maybe it was just,

4165
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:04,420
if you don't know folks,

4166
01:53:04,421 --> 01:53:08,650
bullet ant is one of the most poisonous
ants in the world and Brian Cowen

4167
01:53:08,651 --> 01:53:09,431
described it to me.

4168
01:53:09,431 --> 01:53:12,160
That's one of my favorite ways
anybody's ever described it.

4169
01:53:12,161 --> 01:53:14,320
They say it feels like getting your,

4170
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:15,640
if you get stuck in your arm,

4171
01:53:15,820 --> 01:53:19,780
like getting your arms slammed
in a car door for a day,

4172
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,060
slam slam,

4173
01:53:22,061 --> 01:53:22,891
slam.

4174
01:53:22,891 --> 01:53:27,891
It's just insane pain that brings you
to your knees and it lasts like a day.

4175
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:30,370
He's matching one in your Dick Hole,

4176
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:36,300
rolling inside your Dick off and
then stings the root of your ball bag

4177
01:53:38,230 --> 01:53:41,860
and you're the VP of balls
swell up like grapefruits.

4178
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,720
You can't walk to the grocery store.

4179
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:44,650
You have to,

4180
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:49,450
if to have people go food shopping
for you can't walk around,

4181
01:53:49,451 --> 01:53:52,420
but you could get one of those little
scooters and as long as you didn't fall

4182
01:53:52,421 --> 01:53:52,990
off,

4183
01:53:52,990 --> 01:53:54,360
you got disabled patch.

4184
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:55,340
Yeah.

4185
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:56,380
Get a one of those,

4186
01:53:56,890 --> 01:53:59,110
those fucking gyroscope things.

4187
01:53:59,111 --> 01:53:59,944
What are those things called?

4188
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:00,490
Segues.

4189
01:54:00,490 --> 01:54:01,090
Segues.

4190
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:01,810
Yeah.

4191
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:02,920
Those are supposed to be the shit.

4192
01:54:02,921 --> 01:54:03,754
At one point in time,

4193
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:05,470
people thought that they were
going to take over the world.

4194
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:06,330
They thought they were,

4195
01:54:06,330 --> 01:54:08,500
we weren't going to be walking
down city streets anymore.

4196
01:54:08,501 --> 01:54:10,060
Just be segwaying back and forth,

4197
01:54:10,061 --> 01:54:11,710
back and forth at the
same thing in England,

4198
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:13,150
the Sinclairs thing,

4199
01:54:13,210 --> 01:54:14,043
c five,

4200
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,190
which is now,

4201
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:15,820
uh,

4202
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:16,121
it was,

4203
01:54:16,121 --> 01:54:16,800
uh,

4204
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:17,250
like uh,

4205
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:18,520
you never heard of this in class?

4206
01:54:18,521 --> 01:54:19,270
He five of it?

4207
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:19,580
No,

4208
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:19,901
no,

4209
01:54:19,901 --> 01:54:20,410
no.

4210
01:54:20,410 --> 01:54:21,310
Not many people have,

4211
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,330
what is it like in the 1976,

4212
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,670
six little fucking car?

4213
01:54:24,970 --> 01:54:25,770
Uh,

4214
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:26,290
which uh,

4215
01:54:26,290 --> 01:54:29,840
I think that might have a pedal wasn't
in front of be solar powered on,

4216
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:30,910
but there were for fault fortune.

4217
01:54:30,911 --> 01:54:32,560
Now solar powered in the 70s.

4218
01:54:32,610 --> 01:54:33,180
Yeah,

4219
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:34,013
I think so.

4220
01:54:34,210 --> 01:54:36,940
That's something they have
solar power in his seventies.

4221
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:38,440
Still talking about a sunroof.

4222
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:39,820
They have a sunroof warm.

4223
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:41,790
So would you say that's it?

4224
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:44,160
And a magnifying glass and a,

4225
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:45,150
it would come down.

4226
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:45,310
Yeah.

4227
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:45,641
Burn.

4228
01:54:45,641 --> 01:54:46,420
You know,

4229
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:48,070
I'm the African can't be pedals,

4230
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:49,120
but Sinclair's he pipe.

4231
01:54:49,121 --> 01:54:50,260
But there were a lot of money now.

4232
01:54:50,410 --> 01:54:50,890
Really?

4233
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:51,380
Well there were,

4234
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:52,750
cause there's such a failure.

4235
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:54,300
They know like a collector though.

4236
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:55,900
It's a weird thing that we love.

4237
01:54:55,901 --> 01:54:58,060
Like a lot of old shit is that you go,

4238
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:58,421
wow.

4239
01:54:58,421 --> 01:54:59,254
There we go.

4240
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:01,300
So it looks like it's a panel.

4241
01:55:01,870 --> 01:55:02,251
Yeah.

4242
01:55:02,251 --> 01:55:02,620
Yeah.

4243
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:02,950
Okay.

4244
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:03,783
How do you steer?

4245
01:55:03,970 --> 01:55:08,970
So am I missing choir to ask
him if you asked six times,

4246
01:55:09,141 --> 01:55:09,974
so suck your Dick.

4247
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:12,173
No,

4248
01:55:12,430 --> 01:55:13,263
no,

4249
01:55:13,690 --> 01:55:14,523
no,

4250
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:16,000
no.

4251
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:17,593
So

4252
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:20,900
who gets to never sex if you're oh seven.

4253
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:24,650
And he guy that wears socks
like that will suck your Dick.

4254
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:25,870
You just have to be persistent.

4255
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:26,743
Well,

4256
01:55:28,150 --> 01:55:29,230
I'm sure all the other pictures,

4257
01:55:29,231 --> 01:55:31,480
the guys like Trump normal asking him,

4258
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:32,290
nope.

4259
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:33,123
Nope.

4260
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:36,190
It's a gay pickup site
disguise as a bike car.

4261
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:37,950
Wow.

4262
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:38,800
There's a forum.

4263
01:55:38,801 --> 01:55:41,320
And on that forum they talk about
where they parked their bikes.

4264
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:44,330
I parked mine by the big oak tree,

4265
01:55:44,331 --> 01:55:44,691
you know,

4266
01:55:44,691 --> 01:55:46,940
it would be near the highway goes,

4267
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:47,541
all right,

4268
01:55:47,541 --> 01:55:49,750
I'll be dressed like a wizard
if I get dogging thing.

4269
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:51,500
This guy's dressed like a wizard.

4270
01:55:51,501 --> 01:55:52,670
He's out riding his little bike.

4271
01:55:52,730 --> 01:55:53,563
Look at this guy.

4272
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,930
I'm working for Harry Potter and he's
going to meet him in the woods and suck

4273
01:55:56,931 --> 01:55:57,764
his dick.

4274
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:01,940
I can see it and I want to go there.

4275
01:56:01,941 --> 01:56:02,540
And they uh,

4276
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,410
they changed the oil.

4277
01:56:03,411 --> 01:56:03,921
That's what it's called.

4278
01:56:03,921 --> 01:56:04,754
Changing the oil.

4279
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:06,800
They have like their own little fucking,

4280
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:08,480
maybe that's why it wasn't successful.

4281
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,310
CMO change my oil.

4282
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:14,600
He wrote that at the end
of that little posts,

4283
01:56:14,630 --> 01:56:15,140
you know,

4284
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:15,830
lol,

4285
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:17,290
CMO change my oil.

4286
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:18,261
Okay,

4287
01:56:18,261 --> 01:56:20,420
where are we changing it right
behind the oak tree over here.

4288
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:21,470
Oh boy,

4289
01:56:21,471 --> 01:56:23,240
I've got a leak in my old phone.

4290
01:56:23,241 --> 01:56:23,631
I said,

4291
01:56:23,631 --> 01:56:24,464
come on.

4292
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:26,480
That's what that guy's doing.

4293
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:27,261
It says kids,

4294
01:56:27,261 --> 01:56:29,860
a victim doesn't even know
what the fuck he's doing.

4295
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:31,041
He goes,

4296
01:56:31,041 --> 01:56:32,570
I think those things
would be cool to drive.

4297
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:35,180
Little did he know that he was getting
involved with some sort of a rest stop

4298
01:56:35,181 --> 01:56:37,410
cult car accident with a templates?

4299
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:37,911
A girl.

4300
01:56:37,911 --> 01:56:39,510
Actually I think that's a girl is a girl.

4301
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,180
Did she know that she
was getting involved?

4302
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:42,290
Some rest area called.

4303
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:46,640
Did you hear that the pope is
seeking immunity from prosecution?

4304
01:56:47,390 --> 01:56:47,780
Boy,

4305
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:50,990
I started looking in
on some of this a pope.

4306
01:56:50,991 --> 01:56:51,261
Shit,

4307
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:53,360
because so many people
are so upset about uh,

4308
01:56:53,361 --> 01:56:57,110
what he did when he was a cardinal
apparently or whatever the fuck he was.

4309
01:56:57,111 --> 01:56:58,810
Whatever magical title he,

4310
01:56:58,811 --> 01:57:01,490
he shielded people from child molester,

4311
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:03,530
from child molestation charges.

4312
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:08,000
One of them was a guy who
molested 200 deaf kids.

4313
01:57:09,110 --> 01:57:10,170
So they take this guy,

4314
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:11,480
they take these people,

4315
01:57:11,481 --> 01:57:13,280
they put him into psychiatric care,

4316
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:14,833
then gets out.

4317
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:16,050
Well that's more kids,

4318
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:17,210
Stryker,

4319
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:22,210
it's fucking co Raese and the
pope shielded this guy too.

4320
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:23,930
Took these people in many,

4321
01:57:23,931 --> 01:57:24,561
many cases,

4322
01:57:24,561 --> 01:57:28,910
there's been many cases of it took
these people and kept them away from

4323
01:57:28,911 --> 01:57:29,744
prosecution.

4324
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:31,100
It's a terrifying,

4325
01:57:31,130 --> 01:57:34,850
terrifying story of how someone who,

4326
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:35,511
the people,

4327
01:57:35,511 --> 01:57:36,230
the the,

4328
01:57:36,230 --> 01:57:36,950
I mean,

4329
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:41,690
I think most people who are
Catholic probably have no idea.

4330
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:47,020
Like how deep the organization goes with
its willingness to protect pedophiles.

4331
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:49,100
They want to know.

4332
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:50,360
I don't think they want to know either,

4333
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:54,050
but they like to think of it
as it's part of being Catholic.

4334
01:57:54,051 --> 01:57:55,040
And the idea of being,

4335
01:57:55,041 --> 01:57:55,161
I,

4336
01:57:55,161 --> 01:57:57,380
I have a friend and like
I'm not a religious guy.

4337
01:57:57,381 --> 01:57:57,651
I don't,

4338
01:57:57,651 --> 01:57:58,730
I don't believe in religion.

4339
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:01,970
I th I believe it's very possible
that there's a higher power.

4340
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:05,720
But I believe that whenever you let people
write shit down and tell you what the

4341
01:58:05,721 --> 01:58:07,970
fuck is supposed to be done
and not supposed to be done,

4342
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:09,800
you lost it all.

4343
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:11,030
It's like people are corrupt.

4344
01:58:11,031 --> 01:58:11,864
They've always been corrupt.

4345
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:13,200
Yeah.

4346
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:13,640
And,

4347
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:16,940
and you're talking about people that lived
a long time ago when we really didn't

4348
01:58:16,941 --> 01:58:19,310
understand the distribution
of information.

4349
01:58:19,311 --> 01:58:21,020
We didn't understand writing things down.

4350
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:25,580
We didn't understand what you were
just telling each other stories for a

4351
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:27,320
thousand years for anybody
even wrote that down on paper.

4352
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:28,040
That's,

4353
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:28,873
I can't,

4354
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:29,361
I can't,

4355
01:58:29,361 --> 01:58:30,380
I can't go with you on that.

4356
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:30,801
Okay?

4357
01:58:30,801 --> 01:58:33,560
You can believe it if you like and
I see where you're coming from.

4358
01:58:33,561 --> 01:58:33,711
I,

4359
01:58:33,711 --> 01:58:34,431
it would be nicer.

4360
01:58:34,431 --> 01:58:35,264
It was true.

4361
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:40,330
But that doesn't mean that the people
that choose to agree with that also choose

4362
01:58:40,371 --> 01:58:45,371
to agree with and child molestation and
all the shit that's going on that they,

4363
01:58:45,710 --> 01:58:46,310
they,

4364
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:48,490
they are connected to the idea of God.

4365
01:58:48,491 --> 01:58:49,780
They're connected to the idea of,

4366
01:58:49,781 --> 01:58:50,110
of,

4367
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:50,861
of sin,

4368
01:58:50,861 --> 01:58:51,520
religion.

4369
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,490
They're not connected to the reality
of what these priests are doing.

4370
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:58,690
So it's the fact that in
this day question it though,

4371
01:58:58,691 --> 01:58:59,524
don't they?

4372
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:00,663
They do

4373
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:02,690
lock them away,

4374
01:59:02,690 --> 01:59:04,990
but DEMEC it's an epidemic.

4375
01:59:05,020 --> 01:59:05,321
Okay.

4376
01:59:05,321 --> 01:59:06,940
If it was NASCAR,

4377
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:07,721
race drivers,

4378
01:59:07,721 --> 01:59:08,554
fucking kids,

4379
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:11,230
the shit would be closed
down a long time ago.

4380
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:14,950
They've spent hundreds of millions
of dollars paying people off,

4381
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:19,060
hundreds of millions of dollars paying
people off because they fuck their kids.

4382
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:20,980
It's craziness.

4383
01:59:20,981 --> 01:59:25,981
It's not one case or two cases and was
money cases you don't know me don't know.

4384
01:59:28,631 --> 01:59:29,261
I don't know.

4385
01:59:29,261 --> 01:59:31,960
I don't know if someone offered
me money until this goes away.

4386
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:32,251
I'm,

4387
01:59:32,251 --> 01:59:32,590
I'm,

4388
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:32,880
you know,

4389
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,330
fall.

4390
01:59:33,330 --> 01:59:35,680
You got pimping out your child,

4391
01:59:35,890 --> 01:59:37,650
not just selling you a kid facade.

4392
01:59:37,690 --> 01:59:38,890
It's craziness.

4393
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:39,490
It's ABS.

4394
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:40,750
The whole thing is crazy,

4395
01:59:40,751 --> 01:59:44,970
but there's been many of these guys that
were shielded from prosecution because

4396
01:59:44,990 --> 01:59:45,341
the pope,

4397
01:59:45,341 --> 01:59:46,690
they should have been in jail.

4398
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:48,310
In general population.

4399
01:59:48,311 --> 01:59:48,611
There's,

4400
01:59:48,611 --> 01:59:50,620
there's nothing holy about these people.

4401
01:59:50,621 --> 01:59:52,030
There's nothing pious about these people.

4402
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:56,590
These are fucking sex criminals and
they're out there doing their thing.

4403
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:58,540
Then they don't even
take their titles away.

4404
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:01,720
Deviled made me do it and then
they don't even say that man.

4405
02:00:01,721 --> 02:00:04,480
They just sweep it under the
rug and say that there's,

4406
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:09,510
there's been guys that have said that
the children have tempted the priests and

4407
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:12,340
that unknowingly not even
knowing what they're doing.

4408
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:13,273
Yes.

4409
02:00:13,550 --> 02:00:14,950
Funky bowls joke.

4410
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:16,990
Frank boils a English correct.

4411
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:17,850
What is it?

4412
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:18,683
What does this joke?

4413
02:00:19,130 --> 02:00:19,631
He says,

4414
02:00:19,631 --> 02:00:21,150
why do a

4415
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:25,403
download it?

4416
02:00:28,290 --> 02:00:29,123
Don't tell him,

4417
02:00:30,330 --> 02:00:30,851
but he says,

4418
02:00:30,851 --> 02:00:35,010
what a kid's all would go for
that type glossies and fucking as.

4419
02:00:35,011 --> 02:00:35,844
That's kind of funny.

4420
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:36,610
Everybody.

4421
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:38,760
Kids always go for the race type.

4422
02:00:39,330 --> 02:00:40,161
You know the this,

4423
02:00:40,161 --> 02:00:42,280
the fact that they're allowed
to wear those outfits.

4424
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:43,091
That alone,

4425
02:00:43,091 --> 02:00:47,590
you can't allow anybody to ever have a
fancy name or wear a fancy outfit because

4426
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:50,680
all they're saying with a fancy
name or a fancy outfit is,

4427
02:00:50,681 --> 02:00:51,400
I'm better than you.

4428
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:54,280
I'm a general look at my fancy outfit.

4429
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:55,390
Look at all my shit.

4430
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:56,470
I am a king.

4431
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:58,330
Look at my fancy outfit.

4432
02:00:58,390 --> 02:00:59,590
Look at all my fancy shit.

4433
02:00:59,591 --> 02:01:00,730
I got a fancy title.

4434
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:01,750
I'm the pope.

4435
02:01:01,870 --> 02:01:02,321
Oh,

4436
02:01:02,321 --> 02:01:03,880
look at my fancy outfit.

4437
02:01:03,881 --> 02:01:05,410
Look at my fancy title.

4438
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:06,423
You gotta leave me.

4439
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:06,701
You're,

4440
02:01:06,701 --> 02:01:08,320
you're telling me you're a magic person.

4441
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:08,491
You're,

4442
02:01:08,491 --> 02:01:11,740
you're telling me you have superpower
kick things telling me that you are

4443
02:01:11,741 --> 02:01:14,710
different from everybody else
that has to listen to you.

4444
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:16,840
The kids just thinking he's Santa Claus.

4445
02:01:16,841 --> 02:01:17,051
You know,

4446
02:01:17,051 --> 02:01:19,960
that's what the whole Santa
Claus Pinkston a position.

4447
02:01:19,990 --> 02:01:20,261
Yeah,

4448
02:01:20,261 --> 02:01:20,471
it's,

4449
02:01:20,471 --> 02:01:20,621
well,

4450
02:01:20,621 --> 02:01:24,460
it's like that in a way because they
think he's in a position of being above

4451
02:01:24,461 --> 02:01:26,560
them because he's wearing a crazy outfit.

4452
02:01:26,561 --> 02:01:27,610
And when you're young,

4453
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,593
those people,

4454
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:29,651
you don't,

4455
02:01:29,651 --> 02:01:31,840
you haven't questioned
the whole world yet.

4456
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:35,080
So when you see a guy that's wearing a
pope outfit and he wants you to suck his

4457
02:01:35,081 --> 02:01:35,700
Dick,

4458
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:36,030
you know,

4459
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:36,150
or,

4460
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:36,851
or you know,

4461
02:01:36,851 --> 02:01:38,200
what one are those bishop outfits?

4462
02:01:38,201 --> 02:01:38,441
What are the,

4463
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:39,170
if they're not the,

4464
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:39,951
as the pope outfits,

4465
02:01:39,951 --> 02:01:40,784
right?

4466
02:01:41,010 --> 02:01:41,451
But these are,

4467
02:01:41,451 --> 02:01:41,810
these are,

4468
02:01:41,810 --> 02:01:44,640
there's a whole bunch of
stories of these guys who are,

4469
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:46,550
they don't even lose their title.

4470
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:49,880
There was an ABC news
report on it and see,

4471
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:54,900
see if you can pull that up on the
pope and a pope and a child molestation

4472
02:01:56,031 --> 02:01:57,200
charges and he protected.

4473
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:02,200
There's a crazy ABC news story about
it and it's really fucking frightening.

4474
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:06,650
It's really frightening to think of how
much money is spent protecting these

4475
02:02:06,651 --> 02:02:07,310
priests.

4476
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:10,880
And a lot of it is done under the
guise of if they can keep it quiet,

4477
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:12,530
then they can keep the Business Cohen.

4478
02:02:12,670 --> 02:02:12,840
Yeah.

4479
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:15,020
Because the Catholic
church is like a business,

4480
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:15,471
you know,

4481
02:02:15,471 --> 02:02:15,761
like the,

4482
02:02:15,761 --> 02:02:16,020
the,

4483
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:16,221
the,

4484
02:02:16,221 --> 02:02:18,570
the Vatican is a giant business,

4485
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:19,850
a huge business.

4486
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:21,590
So when shit got too hot with this guy,

4487
02:02:21,610 --> 02:02:21,831
like,

4488
02:02:21,831 --> 02:02:22,610
listen man,

4489
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:24,020
we need a new CEO,

4490
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,480
you gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

4491
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:26,830
Why is that?

4492
02:02:26,831 --> 02:02:27,470
Why he's quit?

4493
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:28,303
Because of that.

4494
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:31,790
There's only one reason why he would
be trying to avoid prosecution.

4495
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:31,971
Well,

4496
02:02:31,971 --> 02:02:32,804
there's two,

4497
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:33,501
there's one,

4498
02:02:33,501 --> 02:02:35,120
there's some sort of a money scheme.

4499
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,340
There's some sort of a
money laundering scandal.

4500
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:41,600
There's like missing money or
missing or not placed money.

4501
02:02:41,601 --> 02:02:42,370
I don't know what,

4502
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:43,280
what that's all about.

4503
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:44,420
I Dunno if that's valid.

4504
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:46,250
And then there's this,

4505
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:50,980
and this is much scarier because this is
the guy who's at the highest level of,

4506
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:51,950
of that position.

4507
02:02:51,951 --> 02:02:52,161
I mean,

4508
02:02:52,161 --> 02:02:52,994
he's a Po.

4509
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:53,871
That's a,

4510
02:02:53,871 --> 02:02:57,650
that's a frightening thing
to think someone could get
to that position and have

4511
02:02:57,651 --> 02:03:01,820
avoided what the laws are and w you know,

4512
02:03:01,821 --> 02:03:03,260
and but just what natural though,

4513
02:03:03,290 --> 02:03:04,550
his moral compass,

4514
02:03:04,570 --> 02:03:06,380
it should be that a
person who a pedophile.

4515
02:03:06,381 --> 02:03:06,830
It's not,

4516
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:10,820
you don't put them into just psychiatric
care and moving to a new place where

4517
02:03:10,821 --> 02:03:11,660
they can molest children.

4518
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:12,860
He put him in jail.

4519
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:13,760
They're criminals.

4520
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:14,081
They've,

4521
02:03:14,081 --> 02:03:14,450
they've,

4522
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:15,081
whether or not there,

4523
02:03:15,081 --> 02:03:15,800
sorry.

4524
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:16,850
That's beside the point.

4525
02:03:16,851 --> 02:03:21,851
That person is victimize someone and the
law is such as when someone does that,

4526
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:23,120
they're supposed to be locked up.

4527
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:24,260
Just like murder.

4528
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:25,640
Just like robbery.

4529
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:27,170
There's a lot of laws.

4530
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:27,770
Okay.

4531
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:32,660
And you can't shield someone from that
law because they wear a fancy outfit.

4532
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:33,020
That's,

4533
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:33,890
that's crazy.

4534
02:03:33,891 --> 02:03:36,590
That's bananas and that can't keep going.

4535
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:37,633
It just can't.

4536
02:03:37,730 --> 02:03:40,130
And it's much like what we
were talking about like kings,

4537
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:41,220
you know,

4538
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:43,880
I mean the thing that
Jeremy Sophal in England,

4539
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:48,050
I found out goals and I
tell you to call it that.

4540
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:48,351
Yeah.

4541
02:03:48,351 --> 02:03:48,760
And you put it,

4542
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,290
by the way,

4543
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:50,360
my friend Steve,

4544
02:03:50,361 --> 02:03:52,850
who's English was just telling
me this story this weekend.

4545
02:03:52,851 --> 02:03:53,960
I wasn't aware of it.

4546
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:57,110
And I bet a lot of people
who are listening to this
also weren't aware of it.

4547
02:03:57,380 --> 02:03:59,420
Tell the Jimmy Savile
story as best you can.

4548
02:03:59,450 --> 02:03:59,900
I'll help.

4549
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:04,900
I'll decipher some of the shit you say
like subtitles because your accent is it,

4550
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:06,230
would you call it cockney?

4551
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:07,233
No,

4552
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:08,533
that's London.

4553
02:04:08,570 --> 02:04:09,403
What is your accent?

4554
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:10,090
Melvin?

4555
02:04:10,090 --> 02:04:12,230
I'm a novelist and northern Munkee.

4556
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:13,941
Okay,

4557
02:04:13,941 --> 02:04:15,340
so this Jimmy Savile,

4558
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:16,183
that's how you say his name.

4559
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:21,430
He was a huge popularity the first of
a nightclub in the 70s the first ever

4560
02:04:24,051 --> 02:04:25,930
night club kind of,

4561
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:27,321
and he was talking about it.

4562
02:04:27,321 --> 02:04:29,240
So first have a nightclub I used to Dj,

4563
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:32,900
then when I'm top of the
pope's Benny Hod Gmo fix it,

4564
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:35,900
we fix it was a huge television show,

4565
02:04:35,901 --> 02:04:36,221
right?

4566
02:04:36,221 --> 02:04:37,740
We're all working with kids.

4567
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:40,650
So this guy would like having
to be sitting on a chair,

4568
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:45,651
like a king kid sitting in
his lap and you a metal Jim.

4569
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:47,460
What do you hope fixed it for you?

4570
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:48,440
Yeah.

4571
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:49,790
And you're fucking vape budge.

4572
02:04:49,990 --> 02:04:50,700
Yeah.

4573
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:51,270
Right.

4574
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:55,500
And this guy apparently had
just molested hundreds of kids.

4575
02:04:55,530 --> 02:04:57,360
Well and the BBC knew about it.

4576
02:04:57,390 --> 02:04:58,740
Was that the whole scandal,

4577
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:04,700
how much should they know and how
much it also not only did not also,

4578
02:05:06,310 --> 02:05:07,620
not only was it like,

4579
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:09,690
ah sorry.

4580
02:05:10,150 --> 02:05:10,980
No need for that.

4581
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:14,640
So not only did they know about it
that not only do they know about it,

4582
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:15,520
they uh,

4583
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:15,750
you know,

4584
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:16,391
he speaks English.

4585
02:05:16,391 --> 02:05:17,440
So I'm like trying to
help them with anything.

4586
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:19,620
That's not a good sign.

4587
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:21,090
I mean,

4588
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:24,680
something about during
Joe's lounge chairs go,

4589
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:25,200
you got it.

4590
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:25,591
I'm sorry.

4591
02:05:25,591 --> 02:05:27,290
So Jenny Saville he did,

4592
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:28,970
he did a lot of chow evens it,

4593
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:29,880
there a lot of things like that.

4594
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:33,480
And he did them things to get the
publicity and he got his own ward on a

4595
02:05:33,481 --> 02:05:35,190
children's hospital,

4596
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:39,010
a mental hospital so he
could stay the night.

4597
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:40,380
And that's what he did.

4598
02:05:40,381 --> 02:05:44,370
He did these Ramzan anyone say anything
even we like proper play him off.

4599
02:05:44,371 --> 02:05:45,450
So they'd say,

4600
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:46,441
well okay,

4601
02:05:46,441 --> 02:05:49,410
you can say something but you
won't be getting x amount of check.

4602
02:05:49,411 --> 02:05:51,540
Try to do the one for
this or the gun for that.

4603
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:54,360
So a lot of people knew
that something was going on.

4604
02:05:54,361 --> 02:05:58,030
He was molesting people and
it was a neck failure and,

4605
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:01,000
and neck were feeling that site.

4606
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:02,960
And I'll tell you,

4607
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:03,793
well that's how,

4608
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:04,950
that's how I sound now.

4609
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:10,280
The Colossus says that guy.

4610
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:12,750
How did he get dead bodies?

4611
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:13,330
Oh,

4612
02:06:13,330 --> 02:06:14,430
because he was at the hospital.

4613
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:15,413
They had the keys.

4614
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:16,253
He had everything.

4615
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:18,660
He had a old come to fall.

4616
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:19,370
Oh,

4617
02:06:19,370 --> 02:06:19,860
okay.

4618
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,110
I need to open an office.

4619
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,680
Put those names in the royal family.

4620
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:25,470
You so many pictures of
him with the royal family.

4621
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,840
He was like proper,

4622
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:29,730
proper French with him.

4623
02:06:30,050 --> 02:06:33,510
He was over the little over the
picture of him with a lot viral family.

4624
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:34,950
Thought out some kids.

4625
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:39,550
Well two little kids and left.

4626
02:06:39,570 --> 02:06:41,580
You imagine he's a pedophile.

4627
02:06:41,581 --> 02:06:44,220
Necrophilia cause like he
probably was fucking kids.

4628
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:45,510
It's like this is not evil.

4629
02:06:45,550 --> 02:06:46,383
And I

4630
02:06:49,490 --> 02:06:50,241
look on Youtube,

4631
02:06:50,241 --> 02:06:50,510
right?

4632
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:51,150
For um,

4633
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:51,750
there's a,

4634
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:53,610
there's a clip or it's molesting,

4635
02:06:53,680 --> 02:06:54,210
um,

4636
02:06:54,210 --> 02:06:55,650
like a famous band.

4637
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:56,940
There's a lady

4638
02:06:58,670 --> 02:06:59,431
to what we call,

4639
02:06:59,431 --> 02:06:59,941
what is his name?

4640
02:06:59,941 --> 02:07:00,774
Jimmy.

4641
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:02,640
Top of the pops.

4642
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:05,040
Subtle spell it.

4643
02:07:06,030 --> 02:07:11,030
S.

4644
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
I.

4645
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
S.

4646
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
E.

4647
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
V.

4648
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
I.

4649
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
L.

4650
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
L.

4651
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
E.

4652
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
S.

4653
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
S.

4654
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
E.

4655
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
V.

4656
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
I.

4657
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
L.

4658
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,570
L.

4659
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:11,580
E.

4660
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:12,413
I might be wrong.

4661
02:07:13,290 --> 02:07:16,540
Jimmy Savile molests all fields up,

4662
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:18,590
fields up top of the pops.

4663
02:07:18,591 --> 02:07:19,040
There's fit.

4664
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,220
She's filling up one of these.

4665
02:07:20,221 --> 02:07:20,720
Uh,

4666
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:22,470
I can't remember the fucking air we go.

4667
02:07:22,471 --> 02:07:23,304
I'm saying,

4668
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:24,030
uh,

4669
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:24,810
they signed that check.

4670
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:26,070
Turn the volume up here.

4671
02:07:27,790 --> 02:07:28,350
He's,

4672
02:07:28,350 --> 02:07:29,870
it's a creepy fuck it too.

4673
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:30,690
I mean,

4674
02:07:30,690 --> 02:07:32,730
if you look at him is every,

4675
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:33,583
it's like,

4676
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:34,010
hey,

4677
02:07:34,010 --> 02:07:36,010
did I each man it be the one

4678
02:07:36,090 --> 02:07:37,970
who broke to balk at it.

4679
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:41,270
It's so much for other stars and
over people to fuck children.

4680
02:07:41,271 --> 02:07:42,104
He was mad.

4681
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:43,250
He was meant to be the man.

4682
02:07:43,310 --> 02:07:43,491
Well,

4683
02:07:43,491 --> 02:07:44,324
that's one of the things.

4684
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:46,231
Oh,

4685
02:07:46,231 --> 02:07:46,741
there he is.

4686
02:07:46,741 --> 02:07:47,574
Look it up

4687
02:07:50,380 --> 02:07:54,570
when all the can says goodnight from
all the top of the thoughts and there's

4688
02:07:54,571 --> 02:07:55,404
number one time.

4689
02:07:55,530 --> 02:07:56,880
And of course he would leave me.

4690
02:07:56,881 --> 02:07:58,260
Now it's from the one and only,

4691
02:07:58,460 --> 02:07:59,130
Eh,

4692
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:00,760
she car go.

4693
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:03,631
What was he doing?

4694
02:08:03,631 --> 02:08:04,260
I don't know.

4695
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:08,180
I guess he had his finger
up her like a oh yeah,

4696
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:09,153
pink sauce.

4697
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:09,930
Oh,

4698
02:08:09,930 --> 02:08:10,890
the one in the yellow.

4699
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:12,300
The play did it again.

4700
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:13,163
Look,

4701
02:08:13,230 --> 02:08:14,840
he's like grabbing at her that,

4702
02:08:14,990 --> 02:08:16,620
that's not even the one
I was talking about.

4703
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:17,970
That's a different one.

4704
02:08:17,971 --> 02:08:18,270
I answer.

4705
02:08:18,270 --> 02:08:19,710
Oh my God.

4706
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:20,120
Well,

4707
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:20,953
blame them.

4708
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,381
A bunch of checks.

4709
02:08:22,381 --> 02:08:25,770
You got a little crazy isn't too bad.

4710
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:29,550
It's when you say that all the young kid
and that's a woman to this on a child

4711
02:08:29,551 --> 02:08:32,580
and apparently he did this
to a bunch of children.

4712
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:34,790
He had hit a fucking show by this.

4713
02:08:34,950 --> 02:08:35,940
If you pull up Jim,

4714
02:08:35,941 --> 02:08:36,511
we'll fix it.

4715
02:08:36,511 --> 02:08:36,900
Brian.

4716
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:37,631
It's really crazy.

4717
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:40,410
I mean you seem like you had like these
children's scattered around them and

4718
02:08:40,411 --> 02:08:41,340
sitting on his lap.

4719
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,193
Yeah.

4720
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:43,583
These men,

4721
02:08:43,710 --> 02:08:45,780
apparently the people knew about it.

4722
02:08:45,781 --> 02:08:46,950
They knew he was doing it.

4723
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:47,940
The people around them.

4724
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:48,360
It's like,

4725
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:49,470
that's my childhood.

4726
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:50,041
Well,

4727
02:08:50,041 --> 02:08:50,221
no,

4728
02:08:50,221 --> 02:08:51,120
that's not my child.

4729
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:52,320
That's like,

4730
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:54,690
he was that Jim will fix it was big then.

4731
02:08:55,230 --> 02:08:56,190
Oh Man.

4732
02:08:56,970 --> 02:09:01,710
Everyone was like [inaudible] how
long did this go on for fucking ever?

4733
02:09:01,711 --> 02:09:03,330
He died and no one knew about it.

4734
02:09:03,370 --> 02:09:04,290
No one knew about it.

4735
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:09,960
But he says,

4736
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:11,553
what year?

4737
02:09:11,930 --> 02:09:13,050
Uh,

4738
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:17,253
doesn't say.

4739
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:19,060
Does it say on the top?

4740
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:20,590
Like you know the information.

4741
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:21,543
Wow.

4742
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:23,260
What year was this on?

4743
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:26,690
All the way for the
seventies and eighties right?

4744
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:27,490
Yeah.

4745
02:09:27,490 --> 02:09:28,323
Wow.

4746
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:30,460
You don't know this this way.

4747
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:32,060
Was it a surprise?

4748
02:09:32,270 --> 02:09:33,030
Yeah,

4749
02:09:33,030 --> 02:09:33,700
sure.

4750
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:34,250
Yeah.

4751
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:38,150
She said that you had to pick your group
and pose because you didn't believe

4752
02:09:38,151 --> 02:09:38,691
what was happening.

4753
02:09:38,691 --> 02:09:39,170
Is that right?

4754
02:09:39,170 --> 02:09:40,003
Yeah.

4755
02:09:40,190 --> 02:09:41,420
What were your shelter have?

4756
02:09:41,421 --> 02:09:44,650
We won't have we won or we won

4757
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,040
or we came to the arms.

4758
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:51,800
There you go.

4759
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:51,981
No,

4760
02:09:51,981 --> 02:09:52,731
you're not going to be on Jim.

4761
02:09:52,731 --> 02:09:53,564
I'll fix it now.

4762
02:09:54,710 --> 02:09:55,543
Sorry.

4763
02:09:55,760 --> 02:10:00,140
I'm afraid we can't fix it because
anybody would go spend pose.

4764
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:01,700
It still happens.

4765
02:10:02,540 --> 02:10:02,901
Come on,

4766
02:10:02,901 --> 02:10:03,680
Jim will fix it.

4767
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:04,610
You got goose pimples.

4768
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:05,740
Come on.

4769
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:06,573
I'm sorry.

4770
02:10:09,890 --> 02:10:10,723
It wouldn't be like,

4771
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:15,160
take a fucking your soul.

4772
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:17,360
The focus is what's her name?

4773
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:17,830
Okay.

4774
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:20,170
What has Johnny Carson Nice to twin peaks.

4775
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:21,380
One's name is prime.

4776
02:10:21,381 --> 02:10:23,250
So if you could give him a
pat on them that is your,

4777
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:26,730
that and everyone knows Santa Claus is
not talk like that and that camera is

4778
02:10:26,731 --> 02:10:27,151
going to bite.

4779
02:10:27,151 --> 02:10:28,160
That kid's fingers off.

4780
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:30,243
How about that?

4781
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:32,633
Wow.

4782
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:34,210
I'd look to raise

4783
02:10:34,210 --> 02:10:35,031
a special presence.

4784
02:10:35,031 --> 02:10:35,300
Boy,

4785
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:35,811
the Van Damme,

4786
02:10:35,811 --> 02:10:39,590
unless I love how it says drug jail.com
is it people that are holding the what

4787
02:10:39,591 --> 02:10:40,670
the fuck is?

4788
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:42,200
Wow.

4789
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,840
So that guy was a huge,

4790
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:46,880
huge celebrity.

4791
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:49,100
No one had any idea.

4792
02:10:49,110 --> 02:10:49,400
I'm not,

4793
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:49,900
well,

4794
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:51,800
a lot of people at an
idea and that's just it.

4795
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:52,730
How many people knew?

4796
02:10:52,731 --> 02:10:54,350
That's the big thing now,

4797
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:56,570
but the public as well as a whole,

4798
02:10:56,630 --> 02:11:01,070
isn't it amazing how many stories like
that turn out to exist and how many

4799
02:11:01,071 --> 02:11:04,400
secrets actually get capped with
horrible situations like that?

4800
02:11:04,401 --> 02:11:05,870
Like the Jerry Sandusky thing,

4801
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:06,440
they,

4802
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:10,760
they kept that a secret for a long time
and it wasn't like a little secret.

4803
02:11:10,761 --> 02:11:10,940
Like,

4804
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:11,220
ah,

4805
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:11,450
Graham,

4806
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:11,871
my bigger,

4807
02:11:11,871 --> 02:11:13,540
I'm from my machine or shrink or sneakers.

4808
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:14,450
It wasn't that.

4809
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:14,590
No,

4810
02:11:14,590 --> 02:11:14,661
no,

4811
02:11:14,661 --> 02:11:14,901
no.

4812
02:11:14,901 --> 02:11:15,111
It was,

4813
02:11:15,111 --> 02:11:18,200
he was fucking a gang of
kids and everybody knew it.

4814
02:11:18,201 --> 02:11:20,630
And somehow or another he got away
with it and that's why we'd come.

4815
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:21,200
Suppose he's,

4816
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:22,910
I think he can keep secrets.

4817
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:23,590
Yeah.

4818
02:11:23,590 --> 02:11:23,870
You know,

4819
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:26,870
there was a guy who investigated
Jerry Sandusky that disappeared too.

4820
02:11:26,990 --> 02:11:28,010
There's a prosecutor,

4821
02:11:28,011 --> 02:11:30,800
they found his laptop without
the hard drive in a river.

4822
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:31,880
Never found him.

4823
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:32,421
Yeah,

4824
02:11:32,421 --> 02:11:33,220
he fucking,

4825
02:11:33,220 --> 02:11:34,860
Sia disappeared.

4826
02:11:35,110 --> 02:11:35,370
They,

4827
02:11:35,370 --> 02:11:35,760
they,

4828
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,730
they killed the guy investigating.

4829
02:11:37,780 --> 02:11:39,290
And I asked my friend Joey,

4830
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:40,220
it was like Joey Diaz.

4831
02:11:40,221 --> 02:11:40,521
I was like,

4832
02:11:40,521 --> 02:11:41,420
why would they do it?

4833
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:41,910
He goes,

4834
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:45,530
you know how much fucking money
is involved in college sports?

4835
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:48,920
And so he pulls up like all
these stats on college sports,

4836
02:11:48,921 --> 02:11:50,630
like how much the alumni get,

4837
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:51,471
like how much,

4838
02:11:51,471 --> 02:11:51,681
uh,

4839
02:11:51,681 --> 02:11:51,871
the,

4840
02:11:51,871 --> 02:11:52,160
the,

4841
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:52,531
like a,

4842
02:11:52,531 --> 02:11:55,160
a college can get from people donating.

4843
02:11:55,161 --> 02:11:56,150
People that used to go there,

4844
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:58,070
it's billions of dollars.

4845
02:11:58,100 --> 02:11:59,390
It's crazy money.

4846
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:01,760
It's ridiculous how much money it is.

4847
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:02,953
And um,

4848
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:05,180
that's sort of the same
thing with the Vatican.

4849
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:08,180
It's sort of the same thing
with this BBC program.

4850
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:11,090
There's a lot of people making money
and nobody wants to fuck it up.

4851
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:12,060
Same thing,

4852
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:13,010
Jerry Sandusky.

4853
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:14,390
It's the same thing.

4854
02:12:14,391 --> 02:12:19,130
It's like somehow or another people can
spire to allow horrible things to happen

4855
02:12:19,131 --> 02:12:19,964
to children.

4856
02:12:20,030 --> 02:12:20,930
Just don't think about it.

4857
02:12:21,010 --> 02:12:21,121
Well,

4858
02:12:21,121 --> 02:12:21,320
that's,

4859
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:23,690
I don't know that it's not
that they don't think about it,

4860
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:26,930
it's that they think about money more
than they think about what's right.

4861
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:27,651
The only,

4862
02:12:27,651 --> 02:12:27,980
I mean,

4863
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:29,270
at this point in time,

4864
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:29,660
there's,

4865
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:31,550
there's no way anybody can,

4866
02:12:31,610 --> 02:12:31,970
I mean,

4867
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:35,360
it's not like you're shocked when you
hear about a priest molesting each kit.

4868
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:35,840
No,

4869
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:36,710
no one's shocked.

4870
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:37,850
You're angered,

4871
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:38,471
you're sad,

4872
02:12:38,471 --> 02:12:39,290
and you're,

4873
02:12:39,290 --> 02:12:39,921
you're horrified,

4874
02:12:39,921 --> 02:12:40,401
but you can't,

4875
02:12:40,401 --> 02:12:40,580
like,

4876
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:43,340
I don't believe that's not possible.

4877
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:44,720
It's not possible.

4878
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:45,980
If you found out,

4879
02:12:45,981 --> 02:12:48,380
like say that Brad Pitt
was a child molester,

4880
02:12:48,381 --> 02:12:49,640
that you'd be devastated.

4881
02:12:49,641 --> 02:12:50,001
He'd be like,

4882
02:12:50,001 --> 02:12:51,020
how the fuck?

4883
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:51,711
That's not,

4884
02:12:51,711 --> 02:12:52,010
that's it.

4885
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:52,843
Makes Sense.

4886
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:53,690
That's nuts.

4887
02:12:53,690 --> 02:12:55,460
But you hear about that
a priest is doing it.

4888
02:12:55,470 --> 02:12:56,210
You're like,

4889
02:12:56,210 --> 02:12:57,080
that's the pattern.

4890
02:12:57,590 --> 02:12:58,371
That's the pattern.

4891
02:12:58,371 --> 02:12:58,760
Yeah.

4892
02:12:58,760 --> 02:12:59,593
They're the ones that do it.

4893
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:01,131
It's,

4894
02:13:01,131 --> 02:13:01,610
it's,

4895
02:13:01,610 --> 02:13:02,570
it comes up a lot.

4896
02:13:02,610 --> 02:13:03,200
I Dunno.

4897
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,030
I Dunno if it's all of,

4898
02:13:04,030 --> 02:13:05,240
I'm sure it's not all of them,

4899
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:06,051
but man,

4900
02:13:06,051 --> 02:13:06,884
it's a lot of them,

4901
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:07,431
you know,

4902
02:13:07,431 --> 02:13:11,210
I'm sure there's a good percentage of
priests out there that are in it for the

4903
02:13:11,211 --> 02:13:12,950
right reasons and doing the right things.

4904
02:13:12,951 --> 02:13:17,951
But if there was that many Kinko's
copied workers that fuck kids,

4905
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:20,390
when they shut down
Kinko's as an illegal kid,

4906
02:13:20,391 --> 02:13:21,410
fucking organization,

4907
02:13:21,710 --> 02:13:24,260
when they go in and look at
what's going on here and go,

4908
02:13:24,261 --> 02:13:24,831
what are you guys doing?

4909
02:13:24,831 --> 02:13:26,690
You're making envelopes and hockey.

4910
02:13:26,691 --> 02:13:27,890
His fucking Cockins.

4911
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:29,503
What's happening?

4912
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:30,660
One of them's got to go,

4913
02:13:31,110 --> 02:13:31,943
Alecia.

4914
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:34,330
And at least Kinko's
has a fucking business.

4915
02:13:34,331 --> 02:13:36,010
They actually provide a service,

4916
02:13:36,340 --> 02:13:37,173
you know,

4917
02:13:37,510 --> 02:13:42,130
these crazy foxer telling Mumbo
jumbo and blowing little kids,

4918
02:13:43,330 --> 02:13:44,230
Christopher Hitchens,

4919
02:13:44,231 --> 02:13:45,460
he was fucking wicked on me.

4920
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:45,851
Yes,

4921
02:13:45,851 --> 02:13:47,230
he was brilliant.

4922
02:13:47,231 --> 02:13:48,064
Brilliant man.

4923
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,530
He got the Evoque all Vong alternate.

4924
02:13:50,830 --> 02:13:51,160
Well,

4925
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:53,760
he became a bit of a neo-con I think a,

4926
02:13:53,761 --> 02:13:54,610
a lot of older,

4927
02:13:54,611 --> 02:13:55,990
more conservative guys.

4928
02:13:56,050 --> 02:13:56,251
Uh,

4929
02:13:56,251 --> 02:13:57,670
especially people that,

4930
02:13:57,690 --> 02:13:57,920
uh,

4931
02:13:57,920 --> 02:13:58,360
uh,

4932
02:13:58,360 --> 02:13:59,200
Lowe's,

4933
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:01,270
radical fundamentalist religions,

4934
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:01,890
you know,

4935
02:14:01,890 --> 02:14:02,723
which he did.

4936
02:14:03,310 --> 02:14:08,310
He felt like it was important to have
that sort of a strong military stance

4937
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:11,470
against the tyranny of
the religious world.

4938
02:14:12,070 --> 02:14:13,480
I don't agree with that as well either.

4939
02:14:13,630 --> 02:14:14,050
No,

4940
02:14:14,050 --> 02:14:14,711
I think it's,

4941
02:14:14,711 --> 02:14:15,120
it's all,

4942
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:15,540
I mean,

4943
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:20,170
when you have that kind of
power ultimately corrupts
and when you allow people

4944
02:14:20,171 --> 02:14:24,340
to just go into countries and
under the guise of doing that,

4945
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:28,510
you got to get a gang of corruption and
chaos and craziness like they have in

4946
02:14:28,511 --> 02:14:29,344
Iraq right now.

4947
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:29,921
I mean,

4948
02:14:29,921 --> 02:14:31,960
I racked right now it's fucking bananas.

4949
02:14:31,961 --> 02:14:32,141
I mean,

4950
02:14:32,141 --> 02:14:34,270
it's more unstable than
it's ever been before.

4951
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:37,210
What is I Afghanistan like
that's fucking crazy too.

4952
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:38,770
The more you look into it,

4953
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:40,330
the more you say you bought.

4954
02:14:40,670 --> 02:14:41,320
He just,

4955
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:42,580
what do people want to know?

4956
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:43,800
People

4957
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:44,340
one on one.

4958
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:45,131
I've got busy.

4959
02:14:45,131 --> 02:14:45,970
They've got nine to five.

4960
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:48,700
You've got no time for an event.

4961
02:14:48,730 --> 02:14:49,420
No time.

4962
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:50,650
And it's all the way over there.

4963
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:56,140
Miles or James Thompson.

4964
02:14:56,141 --> 02:14:56,960
We're not going over there.

4965
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,050
I worry about that.

4966
02:14:58,280 --> 02:14:59,890
Stay over here and get a burger.

4967
02:15:00,190 --> 02:15:00,791
Sit back.

4968
02:15:00,791 --> 02:15:01,624
Relax.

4969
02:15:02,910 --> 02:15:03,550
Yeah.

4970
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:03,970
No,

4971
02:15:03,970 --> 02:15:05,560
I'm not saying he's so easily done.

4972
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:07,810
So you're not fighting for
the Superfight league anymore?

4973
02:15:07,870 --> 02:15:08,230
No.

4974
02:15:08,230 --> 02:15:08,741

4975
02:15:08,741 --> 02:15:09,250

4978
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,060
Now you a it training.

4979
02:15:12,070 --> 02:15:12,940
Any more specific?

4980
02:15:13,090 --> 02:15:13,923
Not,

4981
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:15,280
I'm trying to Olympians.

4982

4984
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:18,493
Um,

4985
02:15:20,110 --> 02:15:21,250
Bristol was tweeting out London.

4986
02:15:21,251 --> 02:15:21,851
Shoot fighters.

4987
02:15:21,851 --> 02:15:22,684
Great team.

4988
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:24,850
But I needed to get into
London with my gambling.

4989
02:15:24,851 --> 02:15:28,420
And so you know Marius [inaudible].

4990
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:28,941
Oh yeah,

4991

4992
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:29,410
Yeah.

4993
02:15:29,410 --> 02:15:29,531
Yeah.

4994
02:15:29,531 --> 02:15:30,790
You mentioned a few times he's,

4995
02:15:31,060 --> 02:15:31,740
yeah.

4996
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:32,573
I said Hi.

4997
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:32,771
Yeah,

4998
02:15:32,771 --> 02:15:33,080

4999
02:15:33,080 --> 02:15:34,690
I'll do to all the guys.

5000
02:15:35,390 --> 02:15:36,100
They are,

5001
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:36,933
they are wicked.

5002
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,660
Yeah.

5003
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:39,340
Do you know when you tell
the story about Germany?

5004
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:42,680
Yeah.

5005
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:43,310
Yeah.

5006
02:15:43,310 --> 02:15:44,230
That's really great car.

5007
02:15:44,231 --> 02:15:45,670
Listen to the podcast all the time.

5008
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:46,511
I'm massive fan.

5009
02:15:46,511 --> 02:15:47,350
I'm going to hear that story.

5010
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:48,970
I was at that fight with Moss.

5011
02:15:49,470 --> 02:15:51,010
I was at that hotel.

5012
02:15:51,210 --> 02:15:51,830
I must have,

5013
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:54,450
I seen you a breakfast spot.

5014
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:55,571
You've got lots of people.

5015
02:15:55,571 --> 02:15:56,640
I didn't want to bother you at all.

5016
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:57,940
I didn't say anything.

5017
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:58,410
And then,

5018
02:15:58,410 --> 02:15:59,243
um,

5019
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:04,260
on that night I was coming home fucking
really pressing the button for the

5020
02:16:04,331 --> 02:16:05,080
elevator and Allie,

5021
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:09,640
Eddie Bravo was her and
he's eyes or so fucking bad.

5022
02:16:10,150 --> 02:16:11,530
I think that's all I could see you.

5023
02:16:11,531 --> 02:16:13,990
It's like redness and I,

5024
02:16:13,991 --> 02:16:16,570
it's like I got it.

5025
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,550
But it's just weird when
you tell that story,

5026
02:16:18,850 --> 02:16:19,531
you saw it,

5027
02:16:19,531 --> 02:16:22,000
you like tiny sliver of it,

5028
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:23,080
you know,

5029
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:25,670
new gone for folks.

5030
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:26,710
You don't know the story.

5031
02:16:26,890 --> 02:16:27,490
Eddie,

5032
02:16:27,490 --> 02:16:30,290
Eddie Bravo and I were
staying in Germany once

5033
02:16:30,590 --> 02:16:31,310
and I,

5034
02:16:31,310 --> 02:16:32,360
I was getting breakfast.

5035
02:16:32,390 --> 02:16:33,320
It was like,

5036
02:16:33,410 --> 02:16:34,310
I don't know,

5037
02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:36,200
seven in the morning
or something like that.

5038
02:16:36,201 --> 02:16:36,970
And our flight,

5039
02:16:36,970 --> 02:16:38,900
we were getting picked
up at like eight 30.

5040
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:40,490
So I called him up and I said,

5041
02:16:40,491 --> 02:16:40,731
hey man,

5042
02:16:40,731 --> 02:16:42,070
I'm getting some breakfast if a,

5043
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:42,830
if you're hungry,

5044
02:16:42,830 --> 02:16:43,663
I'm downstairs.

5045
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:44,741
And he goes,

5046
02:16:44,741 --> 02:16:44,851
Hey,

5047
02:16:44,851 --> 02:16:46,210
I'm still up man.

5048
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:47,830
I'm going to power through.

5049
02:16:47,831 --> 02:16:49,030
He was up all night.

5050
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:50,861
I was like,

5051
02:16:50,861 --> 02:16:51,161
okay,

5052
02:16:51,161 --> 02:16:52,780
you know that we're getting
picked up at an hour and a half.

5053
02:16:52,781 --> 02:16:53,261
I got it,

5054
02:16:53,261 --> 02:16:53,501
man.

5055
02:16:53,501 --> 02:16:54,250
I got it.

5056
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:54,850
I'm cool.

5057
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:55,061
I'm like,

5058
02:16:55,061 --> 02:16:55,600
all right,

5059
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:56,170
shit.

5060
02:16:56,170 --> 02:16:57,250
So now and a half goes by.

5061
02:16:57,251 --> 02:16:57,461
I'm like,

5062
02:16:57,461 --> 02:16:58,510
why the fuck is Eddie?

5063
02:16:58,511 --> 02:16:59,350
I can't find him.

5064
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:00,850
He's not answering the phone.

5065
02:17:00,990 --> 02:17:01,260
I'm,

5066
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:02,140
I go to his room,

5067
02:17:02,141 --> 02:17:03,190
I knock on his door.

5068
02:17:03,191 --> 02:17:04,360
He's not in his room.

5069
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:05,461
Go outside.

5070
02:17:05,461 --> 02:17:05,721
And I'm like,

5071
02:17:05,721 --> 02:17:06,381
motherfucker,

5072
02:17:06,381 --> 02:17:07,214
where is he?

5073
02:17:07,490 --> 02:17:08,271
And then I go,

5074
02:17:08,271 --> 02:17:10,850
all right then I'm just going to tell
him he's going to have to take a cab to

5075
02:17:10,851 --> 02:17:12,830
the airport when he wakes
up cause I got to go.

5076
02:17:12,831 --> 02:17:14,720
I'm not gonna Miss My fucking
flat if I can't get ahold of them.

5077
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:15,733
So I go,

5078
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:16,730
go to get my car.

5079
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:17,751
I said,

5080
02:17:17,751 --> 02:17:17,961
yeah,

5081
02:17:17,961 --> 02:17:19,190
I'm a car for Rogan.

5082
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:21,530
He goes rogue and already left and I go,

5083
02:17:21,531 --> 02:17:22,040

5084
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:22,371
I go,

5085
02:17:22,371 --> 02:17:23,204
what did he look like?

5086
02:17:23,210 --> 02:17:24,650
Cause long hair tattoos.

5087
02:17:24,651 --> 02:17:24,861
I'm like,

5088
02:17:24,861 --> 02:17:25,694
mother fucker.

5089
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:26,610
He said,

5090
02:17:26,610 --> 02:17:30,710
he told him he was me and got in my
car and went to the airport on his own.

5091
02:17:31,950 --> 02:17:35,300
He's did this all blacked out trunk,

5092
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:36,950
so I call him.

5093
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:40,340
His phone rings and he
wakes up and he and he like,

5094
02:17:40,341 --> 02:17:41,151

5097
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:42,201
I go,

5098
02:17:42,201 --> 02:17:43,640
what the fuck are you doing?

5099
02:17:44,390 --> 02:17:45,223
I don't know.

5100
02:17:45,380 --> 02:17:45,890
And I go,

5101
02:17:45,890 --> 02:17:46,630
I go,

5102
02:17:46,630 --> 02:17:47,990
you're in my fucking car,

5103
02:17:47,991 --> 02:17:48,920
and you go into the airport,

5104
02:17:48,921 --> 02:17:50,300
tell him to turn around and go in it.

5105
02:17:50,390 --> 02:17:50,631
He's like,

5106
02:17:50,631 --> 02:17:51,530
I think we're already here.

5107
02:17:51,531 --> 02:17:51,831
I'm like,

5108
02:17:51,831 --> 02:17:53,030
fuck man.

5109
02:17:53,060 --> 02:17:54,050
What are you doing?

5110
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:55,310
He woke up.

5111
02:17:55,311 --> 02:17:56,690
He had no idea what he did.

5112
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:57,650
He asked the guy who was,

5113
02:17:57,651 --> 02:17:58,221
where are we?

5114
02:17:58,221 --> 02:18:00,380
Where are we going to guys like
you told me you go to the airport,

5115
02:18:00,381 --> 02:18:01,220
you know Joe Rogan,

5116
02:18:05,650 --> 02:18:07,270
Eddie Bravo could fucking party,

5117
02:18:07,271 --> 02:18:07,660
man.

5118
02:18:07,660 --> 02:18:08,740
He knows how to put them away.

5119
02:18:08,741 --> 02:18:09,860
He knows how to let it go.

5120
02:18:09,861 --> 02:18:10,694
I'll tell you that.

5121
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:12,520
I used to work for the UFC to,

5122
02:18:12,910 --> 02:18:13,211
yeah,

5123
02:18:13,211 --> 02:18:14,980
he did a bunch of different
things to the UFC.

5124
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:17,560
One of the things he did was for a while,

5125
02:18:17,561 --> 02:18:19,990
and I really think this was a,

5126
02:18:20,350 --> 02:18:22,480
someone needs to do this and
that he's really good at it.

5127
02:18:22,690 --> 02:18:27,690
Someone needs to do an objective breakdown
like Harold Letterman style of how

5128
02:18:28,781 --> 02:18:30,640
they felt the fight went down.

5129
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:35,860
I think it behooves the organization
to have a professional ring side

5130
02:18:36,230 --> 02:18:41,230
statistician or a ringside rather a judge
like an unofficial judge like Harold

5131
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:44,710
Letterman has in the Hbo and
Eddie Bravo did that for a while.

5132
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:46,000
But I think,

5133
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:46,690
um,

5134
02:18:46,690 --> 02:18:51,690
there was an issue with him and like his
opinions wouldn't necessarily go with

5135
02:18:54,221 --> 02:18:55,900
how the judges scored the fight.

5136
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:57,490
And I don't think the
commission like that,

5137
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:00,340
I don't think the state athletic
commission enjoyed having someone.

5138
02:19:00,370 --> 02:19:01,930
Essentially it was a professional critic,

5139
02:19:02,050 --> 02:19:02,883
so they wanted to,

5140
02:19:02,890 --> 02:19:04,150
they didn't want that.

5141
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:06,100
And so especially with a new sport,

5142
02:19:06,101 --> 02:19:07,290
you have to make some concessions.

5143
02:19:07,291 --> 02:19:08,840
So they decided not to have it anymore.

5144
02:19:08,860 --> 02:19:09,251
But I,

5145
02:19:09,251 --> 02:19:13,000
I personally think that it is a good,

5146
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:14,470
it's good in two ways.

5147
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:17,470
It's not that I want people to
get fired who are her competent.

5148
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:18,910
I think people were competent,

5149
02:19:18,911 --> 02:19:19,720
should stay,

5150
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:20,850
but people were incompetent,

5151
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:21,693
should be exposed.

5152
02:19:22,180 --> 02:19:23,050
It should be highlighted.

5153
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:23,351
It's,

5154
02:19:23,351 --> 02:19:24,340
it's very important.

5155
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:26,530
And the idea that their
job is more important.

5156
02:19:26,531 --> 02:19:27,080
There's silly,

5157
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:31,730
easy job that they're not really qualified
for is as important as a person like

5158
02:19:31,731 --> 02:19:32,900
yourself that's puts six,

5159
02:19:32,901 --> 02:19:34,280
eight weeks of your life,

5160
02:19:34,550 --> 02:19:35,361
day in,

5161
02:19:35,361 --> 02:19:36,620
day out grind,

5162
02:19:36,621 --> 02:19:37,700
watching your diet,

5163
02:19:37,701 --> 02:19:41,540
doing the work for this one moment that
gets ruined because someone doesn't

5164
02:19:41,541 --> 02:19:42,800
understand what the fuck they're doing.

5165
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:43,761
That's craziness.

5166
02:19:43,761 --> 02:19:46,090
And one of the best ways
to expose that as like how,

5167
02:19:46,091 --> 02:19:48,650
how Harold Letterman does
it and Harold Letterman is,

5168
02:19:48,651 --> 02:19:49,190
you know,

5169
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:50,300
if there's a bad decision,

5170
02:19:50,301 --> 02:19:51,051
he will tell you,

5171
02:19:51,051 --> 02:19:51,500
I don't know

5172
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,220
the standard.

5173
02:19:52,220 --> 02:19:55,790
I had it down 94 points a Jones,

5174
02:19:55,791 --> 02:19:57,490
there's no way he
could've lost this fight.

5175
02:19:57,750 --> 02:19:58,950
Plus hopefully like you say,

5176
02:19:59,050 --> 02:19:59,280
well Tony,

5177
02:19:59,280 --> 02:19:59,640
you need,

5178
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:00,300
you need it.

5179
02:20:00,300 --> 02:20:01,650
And that's why they don't want to.

5180
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:03,750
So Eddie did that for awhile and uh,

5181
02:20:03,790 --> 02:20:04,830
then he,

5182
02:20:04,831 --> 02:20:05,190
uh,

5183
02:20:05,190 --> 02:20:08,280
he also would do the,

5184
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:12,090
when you put together like a highlight
package in the end of the round,

5185
02:20:12,450 --> 02:20:12,721
you know,

5186
02:20:12,721 --> 02:20:14,130
like when a guy like say guys,

5187
02:20:14,131 --> 02:20:14,430
go,

5188
02:20:14,430 --> 02:20:15,690
go for a submission.

5189
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:16,290
Okay.

5190
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:17,041
Eddie would tell them,

5191
02:20:17,041 --> 02:20:18,450
you got to get the camera over here.

5192
02:20:18,451 --> 02:20:18,631
Like,

5193
02:20:18,631 --> 02:20:19,530
where's risks is,

5194
02:20:19,531 --> 02:20:20,460
this is what's important.

5195
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:21,270
Yeah.

5196
02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:22,530
And then he would say,

5197
02:20:22,531 --> 02:20:22,771
you know,

5198
02:20:22,771 --> 02:20:25,140
like he would like help
them cover the highlights.

5199
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:28,680
He would be in the truck in
the truck and it was called.

5200
02:20:28,860 --> 02:20:31,200
And like sometimes he would
tell me something too.

5201
02:20:31,201 --> 02:20:31,921
Like he would let go,

5202
02:20:31,921 --> 02:20:33,510
hey look for got for his left arm.

5203
02:20:33,511 --> 02:20:35,710
He's going for a triangle
or something like that.

5204
02:20:35,711 --> 02:20:35,770
Yeah.

5205
02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:36,030
Cool.

5206
02:20:36,030 --> 02:20:36,451
And you know,

5207
02:20:36,451 --> 02:20:36,990
he'll like,

5208
02:20:36,990 --> 02:20:41,990
he would give me like a pointer here and
there and point out certain things if

5209
02:20:42,061 --> 02:20:42,894
you saw things.

5210
02:20:42,930 --> 02:20:47,930
But he was basically there to coordinate
the highlight reels and tell them where

5211
02:20:49,411 --> 02:20:50,244
to put the camera,

5212
02:20:50,370 --> 02:20:51,510
which was very important.

5213
02:20:51,740 --> 02:20:53,820
Have to mark della grotto does it now.

5214
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:54,610
And it's,

5215
02:20:54,610 --> 02:20:58,680
you need a guy who has
been around fighting and
understands where there's a pro

5216
02:20:58,681 --> 02:21:00,840
and like he knows how to put
together the highlight reel.

5217
02:21:00,841 --> 02:21:04,050
Like he knows like it was the jab
that started off wash the jab,

5218
02:21:04,051 --> 02:21:07,260
makes his knees buckle and then he lands
the leg kick and then it comes to the

5219
02:21:07,261 --> 02:21:07,841
high kick cause he'll,

5220
02:21:07,841 --> 02:21:10,290
he'll like mark will like do that now.

5221
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:11,950
He's,

5222
02:21:11,950 --> 02:21:13,680
he worked for pride to Eddie Bravo.

5223
02:21:13,880 --> 02:21:14,070
Yeah,

5224
02:21:14,070 --> 02:21:14,431
he did.

5225
02:21:14,431 --> 02:21:15,264
He was um,

5226
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:19,350
one of the color commentators for pride
for a few events and he also did king of

5227
02:21:19,351 --> 02:21:20,184
the cage.

5228
02:21:20,580 --> 02:21:21,121
He did,

5229
02:21:21,121 --> 02:21:21,570
um,

5230
02:21:21,570 --> 02:21:24,820
the color commentary for King of
the cage for a bunch of events.

5231
02:21:24,830 --> 02:21:26,030
They were hauled some.

5232
02:21:26,470 --> 02:21:27,303
Yeah,

5233
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:28,700
it's fun to see the key.

5234
02:21:28,750 --> 02:21:29,583
The cage one.

5235
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:30,870
Yeah.

5236
02:21:30,870 --> 02:21:32,550
Well that's what I was going to bring up.

5237
02:21:32,850 --> 02:21:35,280
It was raining out and so
they just said fuck it.

5238
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:36,570
Have the fights anyway.

5239
02:21:36,571 --> 02:21:37,860
It was outside.

5240
02:21:38,670 --> 02:21:39,690
If you haven't seen it,

5241
02:21:39,691 --> 02:21:40,650
it's worth getting.

5242
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:41,640
If it's available,

5243
02:21:41,641 --> 02:21:42,900
if you can find it somewhere.

5244
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,310
She in the cage went wild.

5245
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:44,980
It was,

5246
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:46,110
it was fucking ridiculous.

5247
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:47,270
It's completely ridiculous.

5248
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:47,490
Yeah.

5249
02:21:47,490 --> 02:21:49,090
It was literally slept in,

5250
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:51,900
there was one wild flying
all over the place.

5251
02:21:51,930 --> 02:21:53,730
And I mean if you're a wrestler,

5252
02:21:53,731 --> 02:21:54,091
good,

5253
02:21:54,091 --> 02:21:57,180
good luck holding onto a guy
who's like completely soaks.

5254
02:21:57,450 --> 02:22:00,950
I mean people are just slipping out of
that dude's hand's like bars of soap is

5255
02:22:00,980 --> 02:22:01,801
that it was bad.

5256
02:22:01,801 --> 02:22:03,380
It was coming down and t yeah,

5257
02:22:03,381 --> 02:22:04,350
I fucking mental.

5258
02:22:04,530 --> 02:22:05,610
Well those were the days,

5259
02:22:05,611 --> 02:22:06,180
man.

5260
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:08,220
You know and you are part of the the,

5261
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:08,581
the,

5262
02:22:08,581 --> 02:22:11,010
those are the days too
with your pride fights man.

5263
02:22:11,011 --> 02:22:13,230
I mean you are part of some epic shit.

5264
02:22:13,231 --> 02:22:16,200
You are a part of pride when
it was like at its peak.

5265
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:17,450
What was that like man?

5266
02:22:17,451 --> 02:22:18,570
Then what was the atmosphere,

5267
02:22:18,571 --> 02:22:19,530
lack of those events?

5268
02:22:19,531 --> 02:22:19,651
Who?

5269
02:22:19,651 --> 02:22:22,900
Soccer coach shock like
obviously in Japan itself,

5270
02:22:22,930 --> 02:22:24,000
different Joe.

5271
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:25,650
I mean just everything so different.

5272
02:22:25,651 --> 02:22:26,280
And

5273
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:29,950
I remember coming out to fight
and I'm like we said earlier,

5274
02:22:29,951 --> 02:22:31,740
I'd be fighting long and you know,

5275
02:22:31,741 --> 02:22:33,150
coming up for a fucking helmet,

5276
02:22:33,370 --> 02:22:36,480
I cannot be fighting in
front of 2000 excuse me,

5277
02:22:36,481 --> 02:22:38,690
two phase people and you know,

5278
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:42,210
walking out in their fucking leisure
centers and then walking out for fucking

5279
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:47,480
Lyft full of smoke and lights and
fucking walking for some of my helmet to

5280
02:22:47,750 --> 02:22:48,140
Jonah.

5281
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:49,830
I mean who fucking alleys.

5282
02:22:49,940 --> 02:22:51,060
It's a lot to take in.

5283
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:53,190
What was the biggest crowd
that you were falling under?

5284
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:55,100
I paid 60 but they always
say it's more on us.

5285
02:22:55,110 --> 02:22:57,390
And they said about
80,000 cyber collect 60,

5286
02:22:57,510 --> 02:23:02,510
60,000 hours or I've seen that before
at the Roger Center in Toronto.

5287
02:23:03,210 --> 02:23:05,880
We had a UFC there and it
was somewhere around 60,000.

5288
02:23:05,881 --> 02:23:07,380
Between 58 yeah.

5289
02:23:07,381 --> 02:23:07,951
It's so,

5290
02:23:07,951 --> 02:23:08,970
it's so crazy.

5291
02:23:08,971 --> 02:23:09,960
And you're looking around and you're like,

5292
02:23:09,961 --> 02:23:13,530
this is all a lot of fucking people
and these points in the Japanese,

5293
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:14,603
everyone's quiet,

5294
02:23:18,090 --> 02:23:19,050
quiet people.

5295
02:23:19,060 --> 02:23:20,880
I am not because I am,

5296
02:23:20,881 --> 02:23:23,430
but on the lights went down because
they have a guy who was getting it.

5297
02:23:23,470 --> 02:23:23,880
Um,

5298
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:25,300
I can't remember was it was,

5299
02:23:25,370 --> 02:23:25,670
it was,

5300
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:29,550
it was coming in and the lights
went down on a com Hannifin.

5301
02:23:29,890 --> 02:23:30,723
Allow shy kid.

5302
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:32,320
Fuck you.

5303
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:32,971
I'm not dreaming.

5304
02:23:32,971 --> 02:23:33,061
No.

5305
02:23:33,061 --> 02:23:33,960
So it did dry,

5306
02:23:34,730 --> 02:23:35,563
don't block.

5307
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:38,500
And then the fucking lights come back
on and you think in fact came out.

5308
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:39,090
Maybe go,

5309
02:23:39,090 --> 02:23:40,140
am I dreaming?

5310
02:23:40,610 --> 02:23:41,443
Wow.

5311
02:23:41,540 --> 02:23:42,540
Punched in the face and you think,

5312
02:23:42,541 --> 02:23:42,800
no,

5313
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:43,633
I'm going watch.

5314
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:46,860
It must have been especially crazy for
you because how many fights did you have

5315
02:23:46,861 --> 02:23:48,090
outside of pride?

5316
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:48,690
Um,

5317
02:23:48,690 --> 02:23:49,523
I had,

5318
02:23:49,730 --> 02:23:50,490
I felt,

5319
02:23:50,490 --> 02:23:53,390
well I don't know what 10th,

5320
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:54,593
11,

5321
02:23:55,410 --> 02:23:58,170
12 footing if I have quite a few,

5322
02:23:58,460 --> 02:23:59,940
I think in a shelter at time,

5323
02:24:00,450 --> 02:24:01,890
I was just getting 10 or 11,

5324
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:03,550
13 point 12,

5325
02:24:03,570 --> 02:24:03,931
13,

5326
02:24:03,931 --> 02:24:04,890
five yards for pride.

5327
02:24:05,010 --> 02:24:06,230
Hopefully give,

5328
02:24:06,250 --> 02:24:09,000
I'll tell you that's a lot of fights
to have over a year and a half.

5329
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:13,080
I was literally living it
to the gym and I was like,

5330
02:24:13,081 --> 02:24:14,430
this is what my Dave Wow,

5331
02:24:14,480 --> 02:24:19,070
I'm just fucking fall off going
everywhere and just training my ass.

5332
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:21,030
And you see the difference in my,

5333
02:24:21,031 --> 02:24:21,750
uh,

5334
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:22,381
in my,

5335
02:24:22,381 --> 02:24:23,750
in Mike and a fiscal,

5336
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:28,700
my fitness and not like from my
first fight to maybe my full fight.

5337
02:24:29,030 --> 02:24:30,330
I look completely different.

5338
02:24:30,630 --> 02:24:31,171
I'm sure.

5339
02:24:31,171 --> 02:24:31,881
Completely different.

5340
02:24:31,881 --> 02:24:34,170
Cause what is the getting
drunk with fate or story?

5341
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:34,920
Uh,

5342
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:35,753
I uh,

5343
02:24:35,850 --> 02:24:37,560
it was fault.

5344
02:24:37,561 --> 02:24:37,791
Fuck.

5345
02:24:37,791 --> 02:24:39,750
I remember well eat beat Mike.

5346
02:24:39,751 --> 02:24:41,040
Come on.

5347
02:24:41,041 --> 02:24:41,490
Uh,

5348
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:46,490
I'd come home and I was fucking pissed
and I seen the federal or the in the

5349
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:51,360
hallway in the other perception
when he tends to see me.

5350
02:24:51,930 --> 02:24:52,770
Well talk to hope.

5351
02:24:52,780 --> 02:24:52,961
So,

5352
02:24:52,961 --> 02:24:53,131
so,

5353
02:24:53,131 --> 02:24:54,380
so when,

5354
02:24:54,490 --> 02:24:57,090
when he turned around and saw me,

5355
02:24:57,210 --> 02:24:59,670
I started swaying like just fucking vape.

5356
02:24:59,910 --> 02:25:00,631
You know what I mean?

5357
02:25:00,631 --> 02:25:01,140
I then he was like,

5358
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:02,220
ah.

5359
02:25:02,490 --> 02:25:05,190
So then I went over to
type of wrestling with me.

5360
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:07,110
Then I started fucking
about wrestling and I,

5361
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:07,470
oh,

5362
02:25:07,470 --> 02:25:12,030
in a minute he's going to assemble
my fucking cold marble thinking,

5363
02:25:12,031 --> 02:25:15,120
please don't fucking don't please
don't fucking play me down.

5364
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:15,691
But yeah.

5365
02:25:15,691 --> 02:25:19,940
And then he brought me down to have
a drink with all these rallies.

5366
02:25:19,941 --> 02:25:21,350
Mushroom flood or May,

5367
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:22,750
whatever.

5368
02:25:22,750 --> 02:25:23,583
Putin.

5369
02:25:24,670 --> 02:25:25,150
No,

5370
02:25:25,150 --> 02:25:25,730
no,

5371
02:25:25,730 --> 02:25:26,350
no.

5372
02:25:26,350 --> 02:25:27,970
This has been prior to this in Japan,

5373
02:25:27,971 --> 02:25:28,720
it flood to me.

5374
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:29,430
Fuck.

5375
02:25:29,430 --> 02:25:30,340
Maciej Center.

5376
02:25:30,450 --> 02:25:31,440
Like he's fucking manager

5377
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:33,581
potentially.

5378
02:25:33,581 --> 02:25:34,414
Perfect.

5379
02:25:34,420 --> 02:25:35,470
I was his manager.

5380
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:36,010
Yeah.

5381
02:25:36,010 --> 02:25:36,161
Oh,

5382
02:25:36,161 --> 02:25:36,851
Vadim.

5383
02:25:36,851 --> 02:25:38,470
If that do you think Olstein Oh God,

5384
02:25:40,370 --> 02:25:41,360
you'll see fighter.

5385
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:43,180
The janitor.

5386
02:25:43,230 --> 02:25:43,430
Yeah,

5387
02:25:43,430 --> 02:25:43,790
yeah,

5388
02:25:43,790 --> 02:25:44,220
yeah,

5389
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:44,650
yeah.

5390
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:49,650
I forgot got mixed up pants and only that
clamps it till I got the wrong fucking

5391
02:25:49,901 --> 02:25:50,261
person.

5392
02:25:50,261 --> 02:25:51,130
But doesn't put in,

5393
02:25:51,131 --> 02:25:52,140
come to his fights too.

5394
02:25:52,141 --> 02:25:52,480
Like yeah,

5395
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:54,280
it's a huge superstar in Russia.

5396
02:25:55,210 --> 02:25:55,930
I mean,

5397
02:25:55,930 --> 02:25:56,441
people didn't know.

5398
02:25:56,441 --> 02:25:57,081
I'm amazed.

5399
02:25:57,081 --> 02:25:58,150
So massive safe style.

5400
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:02,260
Jasmine fader and his peak man
was one of my all time favorites.

5401
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:04,090
Some of them I time favorites.

5402
02:26:04,091 --> 02:26:04,750
He was just,

5403
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:07,210
it was just so special like he,

5404
02:26:07,211 --> 02:26:12,211
cause he was so stoic and I like
this like just dead faced killer.

5405
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:15,520
And if you go back and you
watch like the highlight fights,

5406
02:26:15,521 --> 02:26:16,780
like Nogueira fights,

5407
02:26:16,781 --> 02:26:17,051
cro,

5408
02:26:17,051 --> 02:26:17,501
cop,

5409
02:26:17,501 --> 02:26:20,890
like when he was like really
like at his very best man,

5410
02:26:20,891 --> 02:26:21,970
he was exceptional.

5411
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:22,331
Very,

5412
02:26:22,331 --> 02:26:23,410
very fun to watch.

5413
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:24,520
He really,

5414
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:31,170
I mean like I used to anyone seen that
many times so fucking Vendome and slump

5415
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:32,710
and incredible.

5416
02:26:32,710 --> 02:26:35,360
I namely relaxes and then
comes back and he's late.

5417
02:26:35,370 --> 02:26:36,220
He's got key lock.

5418
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:37,530
How did he survive that?

5419
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:43,340
So relaxed body soul relaxed but just
to avoid injury to get slammed like that

5420
02:26:43,931 --> 02:26:44,700
and avoid injuries.

5421
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:45,280
Incredible.

5422
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:46,600
He just didn't want it anymore.

5423
02:26:46,601 --> 02:26:47,434
He just lost.

5424
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:48,070
He lost.

5425
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:50,200
Why don't you tell us what
competition's getting better?

5426
02:26:50,750 --> 02:26:51,583
Bigger guys?

5427
02:26:51,690 --> 02:26:54,610
Well I think you can only
keep up that certain though,

5428
02:26:54,611 --> 02:26:55,630
that Rpms,

5429
02:26:55,631 --> 02:26:58,030
that certain sort of
workload that he was at.

5430
02:26:58,120 --> 02:26:59,860
You can only keep that up
for a certain amount of time.

5431
02:26:59,890 --> 02:27:00,191
There's,

5432
02:27:00,191 --> 02:27:01,480
there's issues with the body,

5433
02:27:01,660 --> 02:27:04,330
the body breaking down
after combat sports have,

5434
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:04,570
you know,

5435
02:27:04,570 --> 02:27:07,490
10 15 years unless you're
Randy coture who's just,

5436
02:27:07,990 --> 02:27:08,980
I don't know how he did it,

5437
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:10,390
but whatever he did,

5438
02:27:10,391 --> 02:27:11,560
he managed to avoid injury.

5439
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:13,210
The one thing that no one avoids,

5440
02:27:13,810 --> 02:27:17,620
people who you know have
competed in mixed martial arts.

5441
02:27:17,650 --> 02:27:22,650
If you look at like issues like along
the way like guys who have broken hands,

5442
02:27:23,291 --> 02:27:24,730
guys who have had this guys ever had,

5443
02:27:24,810 --> 02:27:26,380
that guys are toward knees.

5444
02:27:26,410 --> 02:27:28,780
Guys who like kit to neck operations.

5445
02:27:29,170 --> 02:27:30,160
So many guys,

5446
02:27:30,161 --> 02:27:31,560
Randy didn't need chant.

5447
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:35,630
No one broken arm and a fight when
Gonzaga Gonzaga broke his arm or the kick,

5448
02:27:35,650 --> 02:27:36,390
he got his own guy,

5449
02:27:36,390 --> 02:27:37,570
he had his arm in a cast,

5450
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:38,950
no big deal.

5451
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:39,310
You know,

5452
02:27:39,310 --> 02:27:41,620
six weeks later he's fucking
hitting the speed bag.

5453
02:27:41,650 --> 02:27:42,040
You know,

5454
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:42,873
it's like,

5455
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:44,380
how's that guy avoid injury?

5456
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:46,130
It's an amazing man.

5457
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:46,421
No,

5458
02:27:46,421 --> 02:27:47,650
no intelligence,

5459
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:48,971
toughness,

5460
02:27:48,971 --> 02:27:49,571
genetics.

5461
02:27:49,571 --> 02:27:51,650
There's like a whole bunch
of things like working.

5462
02:27:51,651 --> 02:27:52,061
It's wet,

5463
02:27:52,061 --> 02:27:53,770
but it's really incredible.

5464
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:56,230
But for most guys holding
a certain amount of time,

5465
02:27:56,231 --> 02:27:58,120
you can operate at a high
level before you just,

5466
02:27:58,390 --> 02:28:03,390
you lose your drive for it and politics
and life gets in the way and he got

5467
02:28:03,761 --> 02:28:06,460
super religious to fit or,

5468
02:28:06,461 --> 02:28:06,950
um,

5469
02:28:06,950 --> 02:28:08,140
got a really,

5470
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:08,660
it's,

5471
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:10,960
it's actually not even fade or do
you know that's what we call it.

5472
02:28:11,130 --> 02:28:11,580
It's,

5473
02:28:11,580 --> 02:28:12,640
it's fuel door.

5474
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:12,861
Yeah.

5475
02:28:12,861 --> 02:28:13,450
Yeah.

5476
02:28:13,450 --> 02:28:15,070
My Russian friend of mine from was just,

5477
02:28:15,071 --> 02:28:15,940
it was explaining,

5478
02:28:15,941 --> 02:28:16,980
how do you actually say his name?

5479
02:28:16,981 --> 02:28:17,814
It's fuel door.

5480
02:28:18,490 --> 02:28:19,323
Fuel door.

5481
02:28:19,590 --> 02:28:20,610
Yeah.

5482
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:22,370
Like [inaudible] you know,

5483
02:28:22,371 --> 02:28:22,910
it's like,

5484
02:28:22,910 --> 02:28:25,530
that's like we can't fade
art because it's easier.

5485
02:28:25,550 --> 02:28:26,090
Yeah.

5486
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:28,100
The art kind of be honest.

5487
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:29,630
Fuel door fade or sounds better.

5488
02:28:30,290 --> 02:28:31,150
Feel Doris A.

5489
02:28:31,150 --> 02:28:31,220
Little.

5490
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:32,053
So break it.

5491
02:28:32,070 --> 02:28:36,590
The Russians would do crazy language.

5492
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:38,270
He was such a nice guy though.

5493
02:28:38,690 --> 02:28:41,810
He was the guy at the top all the time,

5494
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:42,733
you know,

5495
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:43,850
always at time.

5496
02:28:44,050 --> 02:28:46,700
[inaudible] it wasn't like an
eight lane London personnel.

5497
02:28:46,701 --> 02:28:47,660
He just kept very quiet.

5498
02:28:48,230 --> 02:28:50,180
Do you want me at the time for everyone?

5499
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:50,540
I'm like,

5500
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:51,370
wow.

5501
02:28:51,370 --> 02:28:52,150
Do you know what I mean?

5502
02:28:52,150 --> 02:28:53,180
You really,

5503
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:55,840
I really have a lot of a lot of time for,

5504
02:28:56,390 --> 02:28:57,710
he's an unusual dude.

5505
02:28:57,780 --> 02:28:58,280
I like,

5506
02:28:58,280 --> 02:29:01,490
his demeanor was just so different
than anybody that I'd ever been around

5507
02:29:01,491 --> 02:29:02,324
before.

5508
02:29:03,070 --> 02:29:05,060
That was one of the things that
was kind of special about them.

5509
02:29:05,150 --> 02:29:05,631
It's like we,

5510
02:29:05,631 --> 02:29:08,210
we had been used to so
many different things.

5511
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:10,910
We'd used to certain boxers.

5512
02:29:10,911 --> 02:29:12,500
It had certain charisma about them,

5513
02:29:12,501 --> 02:29:15,570
whether it's Muhammad Ali or
sugar ray Leonard or Mike Tyson,

5514
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:17,570
they have this certain
cult at aura about him.

5515
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:20,120
He was different than all of them.

5516
02:29:20,121 --> 02:29:20,600
He was like,

5517
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:20,990
Oh,

5518
02:29:20,990 --> 02:29:24,220
here's this new thing from a
guy who plays chess and uh,

5519
02:29:24,230 --> 02:29:28,370
it doesn't get freaked out at anything
and keeps his stone and just beat your

5520
02:29:28,371 --> 02:29:29,180
ass.

5521
02:29:29,180 --> 02:29:29,571
You know,

5522
02:29:29,571 --> 02:29:29,870
like,

5523
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:33,440
here's this new look or a guy seems
like he's kind of a robot or something.

5524
02:29:33,450 --> 02:29:34,130
It's like that.

5525
02:29:34,130 --> 02:29:38,930
And he manages to smash like really
tough guys managed to walk down cro cop.

5526
02:29:38,931 --> 02:29:39,920
He beat Cro cop,

5527
02:29:40,130 --> 02:29:41,120
not just on the ground.

5528
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:42,470
He beat him standing up dead.

5529
02:29:42,471 --> 02:29:43,304
Yeah.

5530
02:29:43,950 --> 02:29:45,770
Soak fucking quick so quick.

5531
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:46,101
He's,

5532
02:29:46,101 --> 02:29:49,340
he's an animal and he
fucking trained really smart.

5533
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:51,350
You trained to really
smart and really hard,

5534
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:52,700
but even then,

5535
02:29:52,701 --> 02:29:54,920
like they started questioning his,

5536
02:29:54,980 --> 02:29:55,550
his,

5537
02:29:55,550 --> 02:29:57,260
his training methods and this,

5538
02:29:57,470 --> 02:29:57,741
you know,

5539
02:29:57,741 --> 02:29:58,251
after,

5540
02:29:58,251 --> 02:29:58,520
uh,

5541
02:29:58,520 --> 02:30:03,290
he went over to affliction and fought
those fights and then the strike force

5542
02:30:03,291 --> 02:30:03,890
shit,

5543
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:06,770
he just gets smashed
man over and over again.

5544
02:30:06,771 --> 02:30:10,700
Just getting smashed by Henderson
and getting smashed by big foot.

5545
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:11,721
You know,

5546
02:30:11,721 --> 02:30:13,630
watching those fights and watching those,

5547
02:30:13,631 --> 02:30:15,710
those brutal beat downs just gotta go,

5548
02:30:15,711 --> 02:30:16,544
man,

5549
02:30:16,590 --> 02:30:17,423
it's hot.

5550
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:17,871
Yeah,

5551
02:30:17,871 --> 02:30:18,800
he's fucking hot.

5552
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:20,270
Especially that's your big foot fight.

5553
02:30:20,300 --> 02:30:20,870
Yeah.

5554
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:22,100
Well especially if I hate money.

5555
02:30:22,101 --> 02:30:23,000
So you still went in?

5556
02:30:23,150 --> 02:30:23,640
Yeah,

5557
02:30:23,640 --> 02:30:24,170
just the way,

5558
02:30:24,170 --> 02:30:27,350
even Brett Rogers like prairie
ranch just put up a good fight.

5559
02:30:27,351 --> 02:30:28,300
It was a good cause,

5560
02:30:28,310 --> 02:30:31,280
a good tough fight and you know,

5561
02:30:31,310 --> 02:30:33,170
fatal or eventually caught
him and cracked him.

5562
02:30:33,171 --> 02:30:33,920
But man,

5563
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:36,170
you gotta look at that fight and go like,

5564
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:39,210
he's not supposed to struggle
like that with Brett Rogers.

5565
02:30:39,220 --> 02:30:41,150
Understanding not the same guy anymore.

5566
02:30:41,210 --> 02:30:44,370
He just still got to remark
on when I'm off to the store,

5567
02:30:44,460 --> 02:30:45,920
what am I are they just took a lot.

5568
02:30:45,950 --> 02:30:46,783
They did a little bit.

5569
02:30:46,940 --> 02:30:50,900
My cotton had him on the ground
and had his arm locked up in a,

5570
02:30:50,901 --> 02:30:51,231
in a,

5571
02:30:51,231 --> 02:30:51,750
in a,

5572
02:30:51,750 --> 02:30:52,583
um,

5573
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:53,900
Kamora but didn't,

5574
02:30:53,901 --> 02:30:54,830
couldn't pull it off,

5575
02:30:54,831 --> 02:30:55,880
couldn't do anything with it,

5576
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:58,280
but it was a crazy how
he was able to do it.

5577
02:30:58,281 --> 02:31:01,520
Like he was able to get his arm
even and even have it locked out.

5578
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:02,010
Yeah.

5579
02:31:02,010 --> 02:31:02,570
Yeah.

5580
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:03,710
That's so bold.

5581
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:05,510
And if for doom,

5582
02:31:05,570 --> 02:31:06,680
obviously exposed,

5583
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:07,491
not exposed,

5584
02:31:07,491 --> 02:31:08,930
but expose the fact,

5585
02:31:08,931 --> 02:31:10,960
when I say exposed the fact that Schumann,

5586
02:31:11,130 --> 02:31:15,410
I mean everybody thought he was just an
unstoppable robot and all of sudden the

5587
02:31:15,470 --> 02:31:16,910
Verdugo exposed them as a human.

5588
02:31:16,911 --> 02:31:17,080
Yeah.

5589
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:17,930
Come tapped him.

5590
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:19,220
And when I say exposed,

5591
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:20,320
have great respect

5592
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:20,920
for Fado.

5593
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:25,010
It's not like when I say people
giving me shit from saying that the,

5594
02:31:25,011 --> 02:31:26,260
but the is absolutely not.

5595
02:31:26,261 --> 02:31:26,771
When I mean,

5596
02:31:26,771 --> 02:31:27,850
when I say he was exposed,

5597
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:33,150
what I mean was that we found out he was
human because anybody for BC over doom

5598
02:31:33,221 --> 02:31:33,911
catches in.

5599
02:31:33,911 --> 02:31:35,380
His triangle is fucked.

5600
02:31:35,410 --> 02:31:37,810
That guy is a master at the triangle.

5601
02:31:37,930 --> 02:31:40,750
And that triangle Armbar
was nasty and Fado is stock.

5602
02:31:40,751 --> 02:31:41,584
He had a tab.

5603
02:31:41,770 --> 02:31:42,970
Nothing wrong with that.

5604
02:31:43,270 --> 02:31:45,610
But what we thought before was that at,

5605
02:31:45,611 --> 02:31:46,540
that could never happen.

5606
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,400
It seemed like he was a superhero.

5607
02:31:48,401 --> 02:31:49,480
He seemed like he was like,

5608
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:50,441
like Mike Tyson,

5609
02:31:50,441 --> 02:31:51,820
when he lost a buster Douglas,

5610
02:31:52,120 --> 02:31:53,620
nobody thought Tyson was going to lose.

5611
02:31:53,890 --> 02:31:55,630
We thought Tyson was going
to be around forever,

5612
02:31:55,631 --> 02:31:57,010
just destroying people.

5613
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:59,050
And then when he got destroyed,

5614
02:31:59,051 --> 02:31:59,381
you're like,

5615
02:31:59,381 --> 02:32:00,130
what?

5616
02:32:00,130 --> 02:32:01,300
This can't be real.

5617
02:32:01,880 --> 02:32:05,440
And he was exposed and it's not that he
was one of the greatest fighters of all

5618
02:32:05,441 --> 02:32:05,741
time.

5619
02:32:05,741 --> 02:32:09,520
Mike Tyson is absolutely one of
the greatest boxers of all time,

5620
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:11,080
one of the greatest heavyweight champions,

5621
02:32:11,081 --> 02:32:12,280
the most exciting of all time.

5622
02:32:12,490 --> 02:32:14,890
But he's exposing that
fight as a human being.

5623
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:17,020
That's not as a bad fighter.

5624
02:32:17,021 --> 02:32:17,854
He's amazing.

5625
02:32:18,310 --> 02:32:23,310
But that's a human and every human is
subject to the laws of physics and nature

5626
02:32:24,431 --> 02:32:24,711
and,

5627
02:32:24,711 --> 02:32:25,544
and you know,

5628
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:26,560
and you could only,

5629
02:32:27,550 --> 02:32:28,110
you know what I mean?

5630
02:32:28,110 --> 02:32:30,010
You can only go so far
and just meet vehicles.

5631
02:32:30,410 --> 02:32:30,690
Yeah,

5632
02:32:30,690 --> 02:32:31,640
I think,

5633
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:33,130
I forget the mental side of it too,

5634
02:32:33,210 --> 02:32:34,043
which I don't know,

5635
02:32:34,310 --> 02:32:38,030
but I just think federal didn't
up the same drive anymore.

5636
02:32:38,950 --> 02:32:41,120
I think it's hard to keep
up after all those years,

5637
02:32:41,150 --> 02:32:41,630
you know,

5638
02:32:41,630 --> 02:32:44,360
years and years and years
and years or card training,

5639
02:32:44,361 --> 02:32:45,500
being away from your family.

5640
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:46,221
And again,

5641
02:32:46,221 --> 02:32:47,550
he got really religious too.

5642
02:32:47,730 --> 02:32:48,501
Why are you doing it?

5643
02:32:48,501 --> 02:32:48,860
I do it.

5644
02:32:48,860 --> 02:32:49,611
Test Yourself.

5645
02:32:49,611 --> 02:32:50,910
Why you're doing it from [inaudible] I,

5646
02:32:50,930 --> 02:32:51,471
you know,

5647
02:32:51,471 --> 02:32:52,790
we're doing it to be number one,

5648
02:32:52,791 --> 02:32:53,624
you know,

5649
02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:54,530
we'll your,

5650
02:32:55,090 --> 02:32:55,731
it's behind it,

5651
02:32:55,731 --> 02:32:55,971
you know,

5652
02:32:55,971 --> 02:32:57,380
it fucking out six hot.

5653
02:32:57,670 --> 02:32:58,480
Yeah.

5654
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:00,380
Physically and it's,

5655
02:33:00,690 --> 02:33:05,690
it's to to keep it up to get their
unbelievably hard to keep it up as on

5656
02:33:06,791 --> 02:33:09,060
believable and to keep it
up for as long as he did.

5657
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:09,450
It's all,

5658
02:33:09,450 --> 02:33:12,690
you only have a certain amount
of Rpms that you can push for.

5659
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:14,850
There's only like a certain amount of,

5660
02:33:14,851 --> 02:33:18,120
especially in like a crazy
situation like cage fighting.

5661
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:21,090
You got to think there's only a certain
amount of times and man I can get hit.

5662
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:24,740
So like certain amount of times and
Maggie can get thrown armbar kicked.

5663
02:33:24,741 --> 02:33:25,574
It's only,

5664
02:33:25,590 --> 02:33:29,340
there's a finite number in there
somewhere and he's a smart guy.

5665
02:33:29,341 --> 02:33:33,510
He has to realize that a certain
point in time and then we're doomed.

5666
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:35,790
And then big foot and then Henderson.

5667
02:33:35,810 --> 02:33:36,041
It's like,

5668
02:33:36,041 --> 02:33:36,260
like,

5669
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:37,093
okay.

5670
02:33:37,460 --> 02:33:38,293
You know?

5671
02:33:38,420 --> 02:33:39,253
Yeah.

5672
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:40,970
What a legacy though.

5673
02:33:40,970 --> 02:33:41,240
Yeah.

5674
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:42,073
Well like I said,

5675
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:44,980
what know they were trying to
put together Brock Lesnar and,

5676
02:33:44,981 --> 02:33:45,561
and uh,

5677
02:33:45,561 --> 02:33:47,080
and fader really recently.

5678
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:47,933
The UFC was,

5679
02:33:48,270 --> 02:33:48,740
but uh,

5680
02:33:48,740 --> 02:33:50,000
he doesn't want to do it anymore.

5681
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:52,820
I mean,

5682
02:33:52,870 --> 02:33:53,510
whether,

5683
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:54,100
I don't know.

5684
02:33:54,100 --> 02:33:54,261
Oh,

5685
02:33:54,261 --> 02:33:55,620
through lifestyle photo.

5686
02:33:55,790 --> 02:33:56,391
Don't want to do it.

5687
02:33:56,391 --> 02:33:58,440
Cause I don't think
Paul last night was two,

5688
02:33:58,540 --> 02:33:58,740
two,

5689
02:33:58,740 --> 02:34:00,740
I'll pay Brock Lesnar would have done it.

5690
02:34:00,770 --> 02:34:01,310
Do you think so?

5691
02:34:01,310 --> 02:34:01,551
Yeah.

5692
02:34:01,551 --> 02:34:02,900
They offered him a fuck load of money.

5693
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:03,890
I bet he would've done it.

5694
02:34:04,310 --> 02:34:04,950
Yeah,

5695
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:05,870
I can help him.

5696
02:34:06,500 --> 02:34:07,490
He looked like he didn't want to.

5697
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:08,581
He looked like to me.

5698
02:34:08,581 --> 02:34:08,841
I mean,

5699
02:34:08,841 --> 02:34:10,040
he got the surgery,

5700
02:34:10,610 --> 02:34:11,240
my safe.

5701
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:16,240
That was a huge issue for folks who
don't know you had diverticulitis and uh,

5702
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:18,100
they like 12

5703
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:22,090
inches of his colon is a very
serious internal surgery.

5704
02:34:22,091 --> 02:34:23,770
It was a real injury.

5705
02:34:24,250 --> 02:34:26,650
And then x amount of months later,

5706
02:34:26,651 --> 02:34:27,100
however,

5707
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:32,100
was he's fighting Alster overcome and
Overeem Nizam in the body and kicks him in

5708
02:34:32,161 --> 02:34:35,020
the body and have an Overeem
kick you in the body.

5709
02:34:35,021 --> 02:34:35,350
Like,

5710
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:36,183
Ugh,

5711
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:41,060
Jesus Christ to me before he,

5712
02:34:41,170 --> 02:34:42,520
I think he was thinking about the fine.

5713
02:34:42,700 --> 02:34:43,650
I forgive it's Wade.

5714
02:34:43,870 --> 02:34:46,600
I mean you're obviously worried about
every five buffer gives even more cause I

5715
02:34:46,601 --> 02:34:48,220
don't from Iso I'm,

5716
02:34:48,221 --> 02:34:48,490
when,

5717
02:34:48,490 --> 02:34:49,360
when came be him,

5718
02:34:49,361 --> 02:34:50,320
he turned his back.

5719
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:52,990
Well then when come
out Shane Carwyn Scott,

5720
02:34:52,991 --> 02:34:53,980
I'm standing as well.

5721
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:59,160
I mean I think personally Brock Lesnar
is one of the greatest athletes ever

5722
02:35:00,311 --> 02:35:01,570
enter into MMA.

5723
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:02,531
I really do.

5724
02:35:02,531 --> 02:35:05,140
I just think that if
it was going to do it,

5725
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:06,640
what he did is what you did.

5726
02:35:06,641 --> 02:35:07,540
Just jumped right into the,

5727
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:08,573
what he did.

5728
02:35:08,590 --> 02:35:09,790
He was even crazier.

5729
02:35:09,820 --> 02:35:11,540
He was fighting Frank May second five,

5730
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:13,210
second five second fight.

5731
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:13,810
Fuck man.

5732
02:35:13,810 --> 02:35:15,400
He basically puts you and ask you to it.

5733
02:35:15,401 --> 02:35:16,890
But he pulled it off yet.

5734
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:17,733
But yes,

5735
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,120
he did the same.

5736
02:35:19,121 --> 02:35:20,260
Very similar path.

5737
02:35:20,290 --> 02:35:21,010
Even harder.

5738
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:21,430
Much,

5739
02:35:21,430 --> 02:35:21,731
much,

5740
02:35:21,731 --> 02:35:22,061
much,

5741
02:35:22,061 --> 02:35:22,960
much harder path.

5742
02:35:22,961 --> 02:35:23,681
No doubt about it.

5743
02:35:23,681 --> 02:35:24,471
Came to the last case.

5744
02:35:24,471 --> 02:35:25,960
Shane car when Frank Mir,

5745
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:26,591
no.

5746
02:35:26,591 --> 02:35:26,860
Dot.

5747
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:27,641
Randy coture.

5748
02:35:27,641 --> 02:35:29,710
I mean it's fucking
careers at Alster over him.

5749
02:35:29,830 --> 02:35:32,450
His career is filled with
champions and when you,

5750
02:35:32,451 --> 02:35:32,860
you know,

5751
02:35:32,860 --> 02:35:34,640
you look calm,

5752
02:35:34,730 --> 02:35:35,490
refined.

5753
02:35:35,490 --> 02:35:35,980
He,

5754
02:35:35,980 --> 02:35:36,580
he's not like,

5755
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:38,560
he can take a punch for that.

5756
02:35:38,770 --> 02:35:43,770
Went out the eyeball on our flex
over drop me and he came back to win

5757
02:35:44,860 --> 02:35:45,693
convincingly.

5758
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:47,140
Well he's fine with heath herring,

5759
02:35:47,170 --> 02:35:48,003
you know,

5760
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:53,060
fight the UFC is third fight in the UFC
and the UFC seasoned veteran in a tough

5761
02:35:53,831 --> 02:35:54,680
motherfucker.

5762
02:35:54,690 --> 02:35:56,350
He's hearing is tough as shit.

5763
02:35:56,710 --> 02:35:58,230
And Brock Lesnar just random over.

5764
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:58,480
Yeah,

5765
02:35:58,480 --> 02:36:00,940
this is a guy that was a super athlete,

5766
02:36:01,090 --> 02:36:02,860
but he would have had to,

5767
02:36:02,861 --> 02:36:04,930
in order to do it really truly correctly,

5768
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:06,760
he would have had to build up slowly.

5769
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:08,590
He would've had to do it intelligently.

5770
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:12,370
And we did how to do it over a a quite
a long period of time and he should have

5771
02:36:12,371 --> 02:36:16,210
fought the right amount of
competition along the way.

5772
02:36:16,211 --> 02:36:16,751
Instead,

5773
02:36:16,751 --> 02:36:18,130
he went right to champions.

5774
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:21,130
He went right to the greatest
fighters in the world today.

5775
02:36:21,150 --> 02:36:22,510
It went to Cain Velasquez,

5776
02:36:22,511 --> 02:36:24,080
Overeem indicted.

5777
02:36:24,170 --> 02:36:27,730
He was a chain carbon and he was
just right into these animals,

5778
02:36:28,190 --> 02:36:28,720
you know.

5779
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:33,720
Whereas if he had gone for a few years
in the lower lower organizations building

5780
02:36:34,241 --> 02:36:34,900
up,

5781
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:35,261
you know,

5782
02:36:35,261 --> 02:36:35,771
trying to,

5783
02:36:35,771 --> 02:36:35,981
you know,

5784
02:36:35,981 --> 02:36:36,520
fight,

5785
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:38,170
fight for some other companies,

5786
02:36:38,380 --> 02:36:41,590
get a good record against some good
fighters and then put together like a real

5787
02:36:41,591 --> 02:36:42,430
striking game,

5788
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:43,230
you know,

5789
02:36:43,230 --> 02:36:43,900
without the wall.

5790
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:45,340
That was the thing because he had power,

5791
02:36:45,930 --> 02:36:47,580
the explosive fucking challenge.

5792
02:36:47,590 --> 02:36:48,760
I mean but,

5793
02:36:49,570 --> 02:36:50,351
but he did want,

5794
02:36:50,351 --> 02:36:51,310
that's how he wanted to do it.

5795
02:36:51,311 --> 02:36:52,420
He did it his way and he's out.

5796
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:54,690
No I'm fucked.

5797
02:36:54,710 --> 02:36:55,543
Played Trim,

5798
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:56,833
play term.

5799
02:36:57,120 --> 02:37:00,760
But too bad though because when
it comes to like making money,

5800
02:37:00,761 --> 02:37:02,590
like if you want to make
money off of a draw,

5801
02:37:02,591 --> 02:37:04,630
you think Kimbo slice of the draw.

5802
02:37:05,270 --> 02:37:07,120
Brock Lesnar is a fucking draw.

5803
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:09,130
That's a guy that people
want to see fight.

5804
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:11,920
I mean he looks like the baddest
motherfucker in the world.

5805
02:37:11,950 --> 02:37:12,191
You know,

5806
02:37:12,191 --> 02:37:14,830
we see him standing there like
if you're going to have a guy,

5807
02:37:14,831 --> 02:37:16,030
he big viking looking

5808
02:37:16,030 --> 02:37:16,863
motherfucker,

5809
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:19,210
that would be the guy that you
would want to have represent you.

5810
02:37:19,211 --> 02:37:22,060
I'll talk to you though
to sort of this chest.

5811
02:37:23,410 --> 02:37:24,630
I lost it,

5812
02:37:24,631 --> 02:37:25,464
man.

5813
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:26,673
Mine,

5814
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:32,510
but I have to break it to him slowly.

5815
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:36,590
I think at the very least I would,

5816
02:37:36,591 --> 02:37:37,010
uh,

5817
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:38,600
Ryan Kelly's working for that show,

5818
02:37:38,601 --> 02:37:40,220
tattoo nightmares where it's,

5819
02:37:40,221 --> 02:37:43,340
they take tattoos and they go
on the show and they change,

5820
02:37:43,370 --> 02:37:45,740
they fix it for you to get a reality show.

5821
02:37:46,070 --> 02:37:46,550
And she's like,

5822
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:47,480
she contacted me.

5823
02:37:47,481 --> 02:37:47,721
She's like,

5824
02:37:47,721 --> 02:37:50,210
do you know any MMA fighters that want,

5825
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:50,640
you know,

5826
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:51,080
habitat too.

5827
02:37:51,080 --> 02:37:53,120
They don't want to get
fixed or anything like that.

5828
02:37:53,121 --> 02:37:53,420
And I'm like,

5829
02:37:53,420 --> 02:37:54,253
I have no idea.

5830
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:56,390
The only one I can think of is Brock.

5831
02:37:56,660 --> 02:37:56,931
She goes,

5832
02:37:56,931 --> 02:37:58,040
I must contact Brock.

5833
02:37:58,070 --> 02:37:58,740
And so now she's like,

5834
02:37:58,740 --> 02:37:59,140
contact

5835
02:37:59,140 --> 02:37:59,830
broke my nose.

5836
02:37:59,830 --> 02:38:00,041
No,

5837
02:38:00,041 --> 02:38:00,701
leave him alone.

5838
02:38:00,701 --> 02:38:01,740
Don't even say anything.

5839
02:38:08,110 --> 02:38:09,200
Why did you say Brock?

5840
02:38:09,850 --> 02:38:12,340
Because it's the only one
that came to mind that like,

5841
02:38:12,370 --> 02:38:12,700
you know,

5842
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:13,840
when you see that one tattoo,

5843
02:38:13,841 --> 02:38:17,830
it kind of looks like a statue or
you think you should change it?

5844
02:38:17,831 --> 02:38:18,780
Does he think he should train?

5845
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:18,971
No,

5846
02:38:18,971 --> 02:38:19,571
I don't think he does.

5847
02:38:19,571 --> 02:38:20,201
That's what I told her.

5848
02:38:20,201 --> 02:38:20,501
I was like,

5849
02:38:20,501 --> 02:38:22,360
I think that's the only
one I could think of.

5850
02:38:22,361 --> 02:38:22,670
You know,

5851
02:38:22,670 --> 02:38:25,300
it's like little mermaid
before they edited the cover.

5852
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:27,251
Yeah.

5853
02:38:27,251 --> 02:38:29,860
I don't think he would appreciate
you saying that no two sucks.

5854
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:30,280
No,

5855
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:30,990
I'm not saying it sucks.

5856
02:38:30,990 --> 02:38:32,020
It looks like a cock at all,

5857
02:38:32,021 --> 02:38:32,291
Joe.

5858
02:38:32,291 --> 02:38:32,950
Yeah,

5859
02:38:32,950 --> 02:38:33,910
I didn't say that.

5860
02:38:33,911 --> 02:38:34,210
No,

5861
02:38:34,210 --> 02:38:35,043
you did say that.

5862
02:38:35,170 --> 02:38:36,040
Didn't say that.

5863
02:38:36,070 --> 02:38:36,970
That's what's important.

5864
02:38:36,971 --> 02:38:39,940
Didn't neither one of us did.

5865
02:38:39,941 --> 02:38:40,230
So

5866
02:38:40,230 --> 02:38:41,063
it looks like,

5867
02:38:42,490 --> 02:38:42,821
yeah.

5868
02:38:42,821 --> 02:38:44,800
Well I think like he was
at a point in his life.

5869
02:38:44,801 --> 02:38:46,720
I think though his a description of it,

5870
02:38:46,721 --> 02:38:48,220
like he felt like he had
a knife to his throat,

5871
02:38:48,221 --> 02:38:50,140
so he just fucking
tattooed one on his body.

5872
02:38:50,270 --> 02:38:50,910
That's what I've heard.

5873
02:38:50,910 --> 02:38:51,190
You know,

5874
02:38:51,190 --> 02:38:51,600
I can't,

5875
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:52,320
you know,

5876
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:52,891
like I say,

5877
02:38:52,891 --> 02:38:55,710
I've got fucking dates
crossed out my fucking arm.

5878
02:38:55,960 --> 02:38:56,510
Do I do,

5879
02:38:56,510 --> 02:38:57,010
I mean,

5880
02:38:57,010 --> 02:38:58,690
so you're not gambling it all now?

5881
02:38:58,691 --> 02:38:59,524
Is that the deal?

5882
02:38:59,530 --> 02:39:00,310
Well,

5883
02:39:00,310 --> 02:39:01,240
last time,

5884
02:39:01,770 --> 02:39:02,440
I mean that's,

5885
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:04,660
I'm doing a documentary on them.

5886
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:06,760
I basically,

5887
02:39:07,060 --> 02:39:08,120
I was doing the documentary,

5888
02:39:08,830 --> 02:39:11,050
I gambled all the rest of my money,

5889
02:39:11,680 --> 02:39:15,070
my me and my missus money and
I ended up living in the gym.

5890
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:16,213
Uh,

5891
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:16,840
yeah,

5892
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:17,920
it was fucking freezing.

5893
02:39:18,490 --> 02:39:19,970
God Damn on.

5894
02:39:19,990 --> 02:39:20,610
Um,

5895
02:39:20,610 --> 02:39:20,860
so,

5896
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:24,240
so I was living in the
gym on a mattress on a,

5897
02:39:24,940 --> 02:39:25,680
like an offer.

5898
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:25,960
Look,

5899
02:39:25,960 --> 02:39:28,240
people offered me to stay of a place he's,

5900
02:39:28,241 --> 02:39:31,290
but I knew I needed something
big to get me back into training.

5901
02:39:31,300 --> 02:39:32,740
I was humming to 45 kilos.

5902
02:39:34,090 --> 02:39:35,770
I would say 10 pounds.

5903
02:39:35,771 --> 02:39:38,210
It's like 300 pounds plus pounds.

5904
02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:39,000
Yeah.

5905
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:39,250
Yeah.

5906
02:39:39,250 --> 02:39:40,810
Low like free fatty or something.

5907
02:39:42,030 --> 02:39:42,420
I mean,

5908
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:43,121
and I'm not going to,

5909
02:39:43,121 --> 02:39:43,571
why eve?

5910
02:39:43,571 --> 02:39:47,320
I've been the IVP foppish being
muscle out or mostly muscle.

5911
02:39:47,321 --> 02:39:48,270
Vicious foc.

5912
02:39:48,360 --> 02:39:49,690
Like on adult to eighth.

5913
02:39:49,810 --> 02:39:50,643
Pure Fun.

5914
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:54,010
I was in the gym living on the living.

5915
02:39:54,550 --> 02:39:54,950
Yeah.

5916
02:39:54,950 --> 02:39:59,950
Living on a mattress on a than
I have at the documentary side.

5917
02:40:01,210 --> 02:40:02,790
What's going to be starting out on a four.

5918
02:40:02,791 --> 02:40:03,624
Okay.

5919
02:40:03,700 --> 02:40:04,533
We'll fill it in there.

5920
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:06,423
Just stop doing it.

5921
02:40:07,540 --> 02:40:08,030
I tried game.

5922
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:08,380
Okay.

5923
02:40:08,380 --> 02:40:10,120
Good footage and getting more confident.

5924
02:40:10,121 --> 02:40:10,730
And then,

5925
02:40:10,730 --> 02:40:11,380
you know,

5926
02:40:11,380 --> 02:40:13,950
the only thing good I started was my,

5927
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:14,490
in my,

5928
02:40:14,490 --> 02:40:16,650
with my blog is really good figure.

5929
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:17,550
Start doing a gamble gambler,

5930
02:40:17,570 --> 02:40:19,440
watch my blog and uh,

5931
02:40:19,890 --> 02:40:20,430
you know,

5932
02:40:20,430 --> 02:40:22,870
start just stopped doing
that and getting either,

5933
02:40:23,470 --> 02:40:24,510
it's gone really well.

5934
02:40:25,090 --> 02:40:25,331
Yeah.

5935
02:40:25,331 --> 02:40:29,110
You started this sort of social
media campaign around the same time,

5936
02:40:29,111 --> 02:40:29,944
is that what it was?

5937
02:40:30,250 --> 02:40:31,250
Social media campaigns?

5938
02:40:31,270 --> 02:40:31,480
Yeah.

5939
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:31,670
Well,

5940
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:31,840
the,

5941
02:40:31,840 --> 02:40:32,621
the videos,

5942
02:40:32,621 --> 02:40:33,454
the blog.

5943
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:34,500
Yeah.

5944
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:37,070
But basically I got
confidence in my writing.

5945
02:40:37,370 --> 02:40:38,420
I think I'm a good writer.

5946
02:40:39,200 --> 02:40:43,240
I get extra credit because I looked
the way I do and I'm an MMA fight,

5947
02:40:43,241 --> 02:40:43,940
so they think,

5948
02:40:43,940 --> 02:40:45,590
oh well I forgot and then,

5949
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:45,771
oh,

5950
02:40:45,771 --> 02:40:47,090
we can string a sentence together,

5951
02:40:47,630 --> 02:40:48,250
you know,

5952
02:40:48,250 --> 02:40:49,220
I'll take that extra credit.

5953
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:49,831
Yeah.

5954
02:40:49,831 --> 02:40:49,951
No,

5955
02:40:49,951 --> 02:40:51,030
it's fun riding you.

5956
02:40:51,031 --> 02:40:51,201
You,

5957
02:40:51,201 --> 02:40:52,890
you have fun with it and it's cool.

5958
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:54,060
Colossal concerns.

5959
02:40:54,061 --> 02:40:54,481
It's called,

5960
02:40:54,481 --> 02:40:54,810
right?

5961
02:40:54,810 --> 02:40:55,020
Yeah.

5962
02:40:55,020 --> 02:40:55,910
Colossus concerns.

5963
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:56,830
I've got my website,

5964
02:40:56,831 --> 02:40:58,380
colossus concerns and where,

5965
02:40:58,381 --> 02:40:58,891
where they,

5966
02:40:58,891 --> 02:40:59,100
uh,

5967
02:40:59,100 --> 02:40:59,790
where can they get it?

5968
02:40:59,790 --> 02:41:01,020
What is the muscle website?

5969
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:02,520
I've got a website.

5970
02:41:02,521 --> 02:41:05,070
It's the colossal collective.com.

5971
02:41:05,130 --> 02:41:06,330
So it's colossal concerns,

5972
02:41:06,331 --> 02:41:07,760
not colossus concern.

5973
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:08,130
Oh yeah.

5974
02:41:08,130 --> 02:41:08,911
I always kept that long.

5975
02:41:08,911 --> 02:41:12,080
My message goes every fucking time.

5976
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:12,993
Huh?

5977
02:41:13,730 --> 02:41:14,360
Constantly.

5978
02:41:14,360 --> 02:41:15,450
Ivy fucking video.

5979
02:41:15,451 --> 02:41:16,284
I've done well.

5980
02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:16,980
Everything.

5981
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:17,940
We got it right.

5982
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:18,330
I go,

5983
02:41:18,330 --> 02:41:18,961
so what did I say?

5984
02:41:18,961 --> 02:41:20,520
Colossal collective.com.

5985
02:41:20,910 --> 02:41:22,580
That's where my blogs and my podcast,

5986
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:22,830
no,

5987
02:41:22,830 --> 02:41:23,700
that's my blog.

5988
02:41:24,950 --> 02:41:27,360
Totally won't place colossal.

5989
02:41:27,420 --> 02:41:28,520
Collect this way.

5990
02:41:28,530 --> 02:41:32,550
Say I'm looking at right now it's
colossal concerns that college collect of

5991
02:41:33,090 --> 02:41:36,420
collective collective has everything
you'd get like a collective.

5992
02:41:38,360 --> 02:41:39,720
That's what they tell the bank.

5993
02:41:39,750 --> 02:41:40,200
Yeah,

5994
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:40,621
I guess,

5995
02:41:40,621 --> 02:41:40,870
right?

5996
02:41:40,870 --> 02:41:41,590
It is about,

5997
02:41:41,590 --> 02:41:42,421
I'm yourself,

5998
02:41:42,421 --> 02:41:42,720
right?

5999
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:43,080
No,

6000
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:43,261
no,

6001
02:41:43,261 --> 02:41:43,890
definitely.

6002
02:41:43,890 --> 02:41:44,050
I,

6003
02:41:44,050 --> 02:41:45,930
you feel like I'm in Japan.

6004
02:41:45,931 --> 02:41:49,200
They had a different attitude towards
people winning and losing all anywhere

6005
02:41:49,201 --> 02:41:51,260
else in the world and my culture.

6006
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:52,593
Yeah.

6007
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:54,530
So tell me why I Samurai fighting spirit.

6008
02:41:54,810 --> 02:41:55,411
My first fight.

6009
02:41:55,411 --> 02:41:56,390
It's a fucking joke.

6010
02:41:56,750 --> 02:41:58,190
Vanita costs of and got a guy,

6011
02:41:58,520 --> 02:41:59,030
you know,

6012
02:41:59,030 --> 02:42:00,620
knock him over and he kicks my ass.

6013
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:01,640
It's a fucking joke.

6014
02:42:01,850 --> 02:42:05,990
But what did they appreciate depreciate
that I fucking gave it everything and it

6015
02:42:05,991 --> 02:42:08,390
was something different and
in America and the joke,

6016
02:42:09,050 --> 02:42:09,883
okay.

6017
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,380
But they gave me another
chance to Japanese and our one,

6018
02:42:12,381 --> 02:42:15,050
my next couple of fights and that
gave me a chance to keep going.

6019
02:42:15,630 --> 02:42:16,250
Preach you guys.

6020
02:42:16,250 --> 02:42:16,450
Yeah.

6021
02:42:16,450 --> 02:42:16,601
It,

6022
02:42:16,601 --> 02:42:16,811
well,

6023
02:42:16,811 --> 02:42:19,960
it's fascinating that you've
seen both ends of the spectrum.

6024
02:42:20,170 --> 02:42:21,340
You seen the Co,

6025
02:42:21,400 --> 02:42:25,660
the Japanese way of doing things where
you respect the people who show warrior

6026
02:42:25,661 --> 02:42:28,240
spirit and try and then you seen American,

6027
02:42:28,260 --> 02:42:29,340
you've got to get you to the hospital.

6028
02:42:29,341 --> 02:42:30,480
We got to get you to the hospital.

6029
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:33,300
James Thompson has got to the hospital.

6030
02:42:33,450 --> 02:42:35,100
Apparently he's almost dead.

6031
02:42:35,580 --> 02:42:37,660
Almost beat him to death
and he's wearing Meghan's.

6032
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:41,720
Yeah.

6033
02:42:41,720 --> 02:42:43,380
You have a campaign against skinny jeans.

6034
02:42:43,381 --> 02:42:43,940
Is that what it is?

6035
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:44,120
Oh,

6036
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:49,040
well it's men's fashion as a whole
managed fashion as a whole fucking alpha.

6037
02:42:49,041 --> 02:42:52,820
Now what the Alpha nail is created by
the people it was originally created by

6038
02:42:52,821 --> 02:42:53,660
the people that do on it.

6039
02:42:53,720 --> 02:42:53,841
Yeah,

6040
02:42:53,841 --> 02:42:55,000
I know people that do it.

6041
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:55,820
Sorry I'm,

6042
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:57,260
I made fun of him constantly.

6043
02:42:57,770 --> 02:42:58,251
Well listen,

6044
02:42:58,251 --> 02:42:59,030
the guy,

6045
02:42:59,030 --> 02:42:59,690
Aubrey,

6046
02:42:59,690 --> 02:43:00,051
the guy,

6047
02:43:00,051 --> 02:43:05,051
well I'm a business with is an awesome
dude and it's a lot of guys in MMA wore

6048
02:43:06,620 --> 02:43:08,990
makeup or nail Polish,

6049
02:43:08,991 --> 02:43:10,070
which is the essentially makeup.

6050
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:11,033
I mean it is.

6051
02:43:11,110 --> 02:43:11,620
Yeah.

6052
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:12,430
I mean it's makeup,

6053
02:43:12,430 --> 02:43:13,390
it's nail Polish bits,

6054
02:43:13,391 --> 02:43:13,830
Manga.

6055
02:43:13,830 --> 02:43:14,290
What are you,

6056
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:14,801
what are you doing?

6057
02:43:14,801 --> 02:43:16,390
And he was not as I call your toes.

6058
02:43:16,391 --> 02:43:17,660
Did you pay them that color?

6059
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:19,573
Don't Clark.

6060
02:43:19,610 --> 02:43:20,110
Yeah,

6061
02:43:20,110 --> 02:43:20,920
that's what they say.

6062
02:43:20,920 --> 02:43:22,510
But some guys actually do have like,

6063
02:43:22,511 --> 02:43:25,660
I think frank twig might've been the
one that started out and he had like

6064
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:26,800
problems with his toenails.

6065
02:43:26,850 --> 02:43:30,160
I don't believe that you think you just
like take Fletcher used to always have

6066
02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:32,360
his guys did it.

6067
02:43:32,460 --> 02:43:36,880
It was a thing that happened for a while
when MMA sort of was like starting to

6068
02:43:37,210 --> 02:43:38,650
pop and some guys still do it.

6069
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:40,000
I noticed it and fights.

6070
02:43:40,001 --> 02:43:43,030
It's some guys still their toenails
painted guys can be whatever they want.

6071
02:43:43,031 --> 02:43:43,570
But I did,

6072
02:43:43,570 --> 02:43:45,460
I did this and obviously
it's tongue and cheek,

6073
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:46,901
but you know,

6074
02:43:46,901 --> 02:43:48,550
people come with whatever
the fuck they won't buy it.

6075
02:43:48,551 --> 02:43:50,260
Do you think men's fashion?

6076
02:43:51,310 --> 02:43:51,581
Yeah.

6077
02:43:51,581 --> 02:43:52,780
And what we're saying what you did,

6078
02:43:52,781 --> 02:43:53,650
there's a video.

6079
02:43:53,651 --> 02:43:54,940
It's man against Megan's,

6080
02:43:54,941 --> 02:43:55,390
right?

6081
02:43:55,390 --> 02:43:55,720
That's,

6082
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:56,320
yeah.

6083
02:43:56,320 --> 02:43:57,071
It's pretty funny,

6084
02:43:57,071 --> 02:43:57,281
man.

6085
02:43:57,281 --> 02:43:59,090
You take the matings
off and your burn them.

6086
02:43:59,490 --> 02:44:00,100
Um,

6087
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:05,100
is that like those leggings pants had
like round the light for vaguely like

6088
02:44:07,571 --> 02:44:09,730
fucking tight for men,

6089
02:44:09,740 --> 02:44:12,130
but the and stuff like
what do you call a Megan's?

6090
02:44:12,131 --> 02:44:13,110
That's the clever fuck.

6091
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:13,570
Oh,

6092
02:44:13,570 --> 02:44:13,960
right.

6093
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:15,490
The men wear them on the street.

6094
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:16,840
They walk around with them on.

6095
02:44:17,170 --> 02:44:17,561
They're not,

6096
02:44:17,561 --> 02:44:18,790
you're not talking about the gym,

6097
02:44:18,791 --> 02:44:19,180
right?

6098
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:19,690
No,

6099
02:44:19,690 --> 02:44:20,860
because there's a lot of guys wear them.

6100
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:24,660
They'll get the cat because I am,

6101
02:44:24,910 --> 02:44:29,500
I am making him at the end of
the video being comfortable.

6102
02:44:32,650 --> 02:44:33,130
It's fine.

6103
02:44:33,130 --> 02:44:35,330
And he didn't show up.

6104
02:44:35,540 --> 02:44:36,373
I'll come on.

6105
02:44:37,450 --> 02:44:37,781
Yeah,

6106
02:44:37,781 --> 02:44:38,614
that's a,

6107
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:39,940
that's a good look for you.

6108
02:44:40,030 --> 02:44:41,410
I don't know why you're not embracing it.

6109
02:44:42,940 --> 02:44:44,980
So you take that battle.

6110
02:44:44,981 --> 02:44:45,151
Ram,

6111
02:44:45,151 --> 02:44:46,000
where did these guys,

6112
02:44:46,001 --> 02:44:47,140
when they have these banking's,

6113
02:44:47,141 --> 02:44:47,711
what do they,

6114
02:44:47,711 --> 02:44:48,130
um,

6115
02:44:48,130 --> 02:44:49,900
what do they put their
like wallet and Shit?

6116
02:44:50,170 --> 02:44:50,891
That's a good question.

6117
02:44:50,891 --> 02:44:51,190
Joe.

6118
02:44:51,190 --> 02:44:54,580
No fanny pack or scared maybe.

6119
02:44:55,330 --> 02:44:56,440
Maybe that's the next step.

6120
02:44:56,470 --> 02:44:57,610
I'm not scared of a fanny pack.

6121
02:44:57,611 --> 02:44:58,930
I wear a fanny pack the airport.

6122
02:44:59,290 --> 02:44:59,710
Yeah,

6123
02:44:59,710 --> 02:45:01,570
I do all the time and I still do.

6124
02:45:01,630 --> 02:45:02,740
People see me with one.

6125
02:45:02,741 --> 02:45:02,981
They go,

6126
02:45:02,981 --> 02:45:03,814
are you serious?

6127
02:45:03,870 --> 02:45:04,150
Yeah,

6128
02:45:04,150 --> 02:45:05,120
I'm fucking terrified.

6129
02:45:05,740 --> 02:45:07,300
Fanny packs or where it's at.

6130
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:10,630
If you're not trying to get laid
and you just carry shit around,

6131
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:11,860
what do you care?

6132
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:12,281
Why?

6133
02:45:12,281 --> 02:45:15,720
Why wouldn't you put a
fanny pack on Megan's?

6134
02:45:16,230 --> 02:45:17,900
It sounds like you function begins.

6135
02:45:18,010 --> 02:45:18,843
No,

6136
02:45:18,850 --> 02:45:23,560
that's where I draw the line because
that's where we need to draw that line.

6137
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:27,460
But if you are a want to let
everybody know that you're gay,

6138
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:30,430
where the makings like it's a good move.

6139
02:45:30,431 --> 02:45:32,050
I would say if you're a gay guy,

6140
02:45:32,051 --> 02:45:34,150
you know you're letting
people know what's up.

6141
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:35,650
I'm the fucking ass cheeks.

6142
02:45:35,680 --> 02:45:36,520
Nothing wrong with that.

6143
02:45:36,850 --> 02:45:37,683
That's what they're like.

6144
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:39,940
Don't you like that girls with Yoga Pants?

6145
02:45:40,510 --> 02:45:41,560

6158
02:46:12,120 --> 02:46:13,620
Is that a guy with a belly button ring?
