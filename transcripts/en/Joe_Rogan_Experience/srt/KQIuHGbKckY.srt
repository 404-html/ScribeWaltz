1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Johnson,
what's happening buddy?

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,430
Joe Rogan,
thanks for coming to border.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,190
Appreciate it man.
Other way around.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,293
You're on the short list of people that 
folks consider a rational person that's 

5
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:14,070
running for president.
We're in a very strange time.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,620
Would you agree?
I think we're in the strangest time,

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,550
Evers,
um,

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,840
maybe in the history of politics,
certainly in my lifetime.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,900
Yeah.
It doesn't seem to make a lot of,

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,763
it almost seems like this is the last 
gasp of the idea of running for 

11
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,240
president.
You know,

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,070
when you just do the mathematics of a,
the fact that,

13
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:34,904
uh,
Hillary and Donald Trump are arguably 

14
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:40,860
the two most polarizing figures in 
American politics today,

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,210
that trump has to go out and get 30% of 
the far right to get the nomination.

16
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,044
Hillary has to go out and get 30% of the
far left when 50% of my of Americans 

17
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:55,050
right now who are registering to vote 
are independent at the end of the day.

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,883
Don't.
The two major parties represent about 

19
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:02,160
30% of the electorate.
And so where is,

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,023
um,
where the interests is the 

21
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,550
representation for the majority of 
interest in America?

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,240
I think it's the libertarian party.
I think it's libertarian.

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,890
Um,
people just don't know it.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
And speaking with a broad brushstroke,
libertarian,

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,020
fiscally conservative,
socially liberal.

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,483
Yeah.
That seems to be where most people hang 

27
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,394
their hat.
But it's not something that most people 

28
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,980
identify with when they talk about their
actual political persuasion.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,090
They usually say there on the left or 
right there on the right when you,

30
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:35,310
someone says they're a libertarian.
That's that dude at the office.

31
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,350
It has guns,
you know what I mean?

32
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,640
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,890
The what?
The dude at the office,

34
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:43,160
the crazy dude at the office,
you know.

35
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,580
Well,
so we hit this,

36
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,850
we w w we hit the streets the other day 
in New York,

37
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:53,010
a film crew and asked 40 people what a 
libertarian was and it was zero.

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,570
No one knew.
No one knew.

39
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:56,340
So I,
you know,

40
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,121
I,
I'm,

41
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:57,954
I'm with you.
I understand the crazy guy with the 

42
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,170
guns,
but for the most part,

43
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:03,130
libertarian is just undefined.
No,

44
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,073
nobody knows.
I'm not saying there's anything wrong 

45
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:06,264
with being a libertarian.
I'm just saying when you think about 

46
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:08,604
libertarian,
it's the guy who is fed up and is like 

47
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,613
sort of on the fringes.
That seems to be with a lot of people 

48
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:20,190
associate with being a libertarian.
I would,

49
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,083
and I carry that a little bit further 
and say that the baggage that the 

50
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,100
Libertarians Carrie is survival of the 
fittest.

51
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,963
You know,
the notion that you're about no 

52
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:30,730
government whatsoever,
people are going to die in the streets.

53
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,160
[inaudible] yeah,
no governor.

54
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,670
Well that's the wrap.
Yeah,

55
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:40,260
that is a wrap.
And it's almost like everyone knows that

56
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,094
the two party system is kind of stupid,
but everyone seems to think that any 

57
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:45,774
other party other than the two party 
system is unrealistic or any other 

58
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,900
party,
like a Libertarian Green party somewhere

59
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,950
along anything independent is 
unrealistic.

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,113
Well,
um,

61
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,963
I'm back to right now 50% of all people 
that are registering to vote or are 

62
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,460
registering

63
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,800
as independent.
Statistically right now,

64
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:07,801
43% of America is independent but new 
registrations,

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,790
50%.
So I don't,

66
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,200
uh,
I don't know as the,

67
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,900
as people do identify with the two 
parties,

68
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:14,734
the rigged game of the system is,
is that we're only presented with two 

69
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:18,484
choices.
And that really starts with just being 

70
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,720
in the polls.
Look right now,

71
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,050
if Mickey Mouse,
where the third name in any poll,

72
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:31,051
Mickey would be pulling it 30%,
but Mickey's not on the ballot in all 50

73
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,300
states.
And if I'm the libertarian nominee and I

74
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:37,870
hope to be the libertarian nominee that 
happens next weekend,

75
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,170
um,
I'm going to be the only other candidate

76
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:44,980
on the ballot in all 50 states.
So polling,

77
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,740
I,
I just want to beat in the polls.

78
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,873
There is no way a third party wins 
without being in the presidential 

79
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,940
debates.
That's just not going to happen.

80
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:58,420
The superbowl of politics to get in the 
presidential debates,

81
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:01,180
you have to be at 15% in the polls,
Joe.

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,930
The rig game is,
is that if you're not in the polls,

83
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,960
there's no way that you can pull at 15%,
but it has to be a consistent polling.

84
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,020
Um,
starting now.

85
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,790
I was in the first national poll that 
I've been in a month ago.

86
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,640
I haven't been in a national poll since,
but in a month,

87
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,540
a month ago,
I was at 11% against Hillary and trump.

88
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,003
And was this all established back when 
Ross Perot sort of shook up the 

89
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:34,780
political establishment because that 
there was a lower percentage required to

90
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:37,300
get involved in debates before that?
Actually,

91
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,070
well actually there was no percentage 
points prior to Ross Perot.

92
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:44,680
That was something that got established 
after Ross Perot.

93
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:45,514
And what,
what is amazing to me is Ross Perot 

94
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,010
after having gotten 19% of the general 
election vote the first time,

95
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,263
the second time he ran,
they did not allow him in the 

96
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,620
presidential debates,
which is just,

97
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,350
I mean that's the rigged nature of the 
game.

98
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,050
The rig nature of the game is,
is come this fall,

99
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,380
if my name does not appear in another 
single pole,

100
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,160
the presidential debate commission,
we'll say a Gary Johnson.

101
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,910
He just didn't pull high enough.
What they've,

102
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:15,744
what they won't say is that he wasn't in
the polls and the Commission for 

103
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:21,370
presidents of the basis of privately 
funded institution,

104
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,353
private Democrats and Republicans were 
suing the presidential debate 

105
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:25,870
commission.
Also,

106
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:28,300
we,
we think that it's a antitrust,

107
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:29,320
we think that,
uh,

108
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,663
not think it's Democrats and Republicans
and they collude with one another to 

109
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:35,644
exclude everyone else.
Bruce Fein is suing the presidential 

110
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:39,934
debate commission.
Bruce finds claim to fame is that he 

111
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:45,550
brought Nixon down in Watergate.
But in the next sentence,

112
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,384
he will tell you that the biggest thing 
he's ever done in his life is suing the 

113
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,624
presidential debate commission because 
this has the opportunity of changing 

114
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,800
politics in America.
I mean,

115
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,200
this is really at the heart of this rig 
game.

116
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,830
You can't

117
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,880
win the presidency if you're not in the 
super bowl of politics.

118
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:02,714
We've,
we figured the dollar value alone of 

119
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:07,970
being in the presidential debates is 
several hundred million dollars.

120
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,470
Just think of the Super Bowl and the ads
that sell during the super bowl.

121
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:17,471
And imagine being a,
having our second biggest audience.

122
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,360
You don't have like 75 million people 
for,

123
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,500
you know,
90 minutes,

124
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,790
two hours.
That's,

125
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,000
that's a couple of hundred million 
dollars worth of advertising.

126
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,920
Yeah.
That is the show.

127
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,540
And if you're not in the show,
people don't consider your vote like it.

128
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,374
They think of,
even if you have 50% of these people 

129
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,630
that are registering and saying they're 
independent,

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,180
what they're really saying is they're 
not committing to a left or a right.

131
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,310
They're not committing to a democratic 
Republican,

132
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:43,850
but are they gonna vote independent?
That's a lot of people.

133
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,490
They have this idea that if you vote 
independent,

134
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,900
you're throwing away your vote.

135
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:48,963
That's,
that is a stigma that has to be 

136
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,570
overcome.
Right?

137
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:50,821
No,
no,

138
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:51,100
no,
no.

139
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,250
I,
I agree.

140
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,550
But,
but for those people that they do vote,

141
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,710
right,
and they ended up voting on the basis of

142
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:58,544
the lesser of two evils,
but since they're registering to vote 

143
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,950
and they're registering to vote as 
independent,

144
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,110
they end up at the polls.
I mean,

145
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:07,460
for the most part,
most pick,

146
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,250
most people don't even go to the polls.
Most people don't even vote.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,833
Yeah.
It's,

148
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,140
is there a way to fix it?
Do you think that there's a way to maybe

149
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,160
somehow or another allow people to vote 
online and change the way it's set up?

150
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:19,994
Now?
We don't have to physically go to a 

151
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:21,464
location.
You don't have to sign up physically in 

152
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,880
a place that you can actually just do it
from your computer the same way we bank.

153
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,190
That has to be the future.
Um,

154
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,840
that does not exist now.
But that has to be the future.

155
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,960
And from a legislative standpoint,
meaning,

156
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,510
okay,
you're president of the United States or

157
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:44,900
governor of New Mexico,
you could sign legislation that,

158
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:45,731
um,
and,

159
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,870
and these are the things that are going 
to happen.

160
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,820
It's going to be easier and easier to 
vote.

161
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:50,654
And that's what should be the case,
which should be the case if the system 

162
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:54,164
isn't totally rick.
Cause the problem is people like 

163
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:57,730
Hillary,
um,

164
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
the people that are long time 
established,

165
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:01,940
when people that had been a part of 
politics forever,

166
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,803
the last thing they want to do is turn 
over the reins to the Internet because 

167
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,850
she's had what,
how much they send.

168
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,773
They say they were spending spending 
over a million dollars just to combat 

169
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:15,830
online trolls just to go on reddit and 
forums and correct people.

170
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,850
Yes,
and I would,

171
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,250
I would be surprised if the number was 
that low.

172
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,070
I would be surprised too.
Yeah.

173
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,720
I think they're probably being pretty 
conservative about that,

174
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:28,721
but the idea is that the internet 
doesn't like the establishment.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,920
They know that there's a real problem 
with the system,

176
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,530
the system in place as is and the 
Internet.

177
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:37,700
When I say the Internet of the broad 
stroke that you're painting is obviously

178
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,743
young people who are a little bit more 
aware of how screwy this whole system 

179
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:47,090
that they're sort of born into is and 
that the people that are in charge don't

180
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,220
want to change it.
They want to keep it a two party system.

181
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,860
They want to keep this silly white hat,
black hat,

182
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,040
goofy game going on forever and keep of 
the power

183
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,743
right on this.
But this cycle for the first time in my 

184
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:04,080
lifetime,
this might change.

185
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,890
I mean this because of just how 
polarizing the two of them are.

186
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,053
And I think Bernie Sanders is what a lot
of people think of as the alternative 

187
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,190
right now.
Mainstream alternative.

188
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,920
And he stands pretty far out there from 
the other guys.

189
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,360
So have you seen the website I side 
with.com you gotta write it down.

190
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,194
You've got to take,
take this political quiz I side and 

191
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,220
everybody listening take this political 
quiz.

192
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,790
I side with the com,
it's about 60 questions.

193
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,800
It's really easy.
You don't have to,

194
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,301
you know,
you,

195
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:34,320
you don't have to sign up on the 
website,

196
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,154
but you take this quiz and at the end of
the quiz you get paired up with a 

197
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:40,350
presidential candidate most in line with
your views.

198
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,184
It just makes real sense.
I think everybody should take the quiz 

199
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,550
and whoever you line up with,
um,

200
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,290
I think you should knock yourself out 
supporting that person.

201
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,611
Well,
for me,

202
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:53,520
taking the I side with quiz,
amazingly,

203
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:54,354
the next politician that I aligned with 
outside of the libertarians that are 

204
00:09:57,241 --> 00:10:00,230
running for president is Bernie Sanders.
Um,

205
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,540
I aligned with Bernie Sanders 73% of 
what he says.

206
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,570
Now when it comes to economics,
we come to a t in the road,

207
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,660
uh,
when it comes to the socialism versus,

208
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:10,500
um,
you know,

209
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:15,360
being an entrepreneur when it comes to 
big government versus small government,

210
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,250
we come to that t in the road.
But,

211
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:20,580
uh,
on the issues of legalizing marijuana,

212
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:23,310
same sex marriage,
a woman's right to choose,

213
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:24,144
hey,
let's stop with these military 

214
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,930
interventions.
This is just,

215
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,420
this is just crazy.
We're in line.

216
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,220
So,
um,

217
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,340
I,
I pushed this website because,

218
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:37,560
um,
it should work the other way around.

219
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,840
Okay.
I side with Bernie most of the time,

220
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:43,440
but oh my gosh,
the libertarian candidate,

221
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,303
Gary Johnson,
I side with next in line and I do 

222
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,540
believe that,
um,

223
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,580
Bernie is not going to get the 
nomination.

224
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,060
I don't think that's going to happen.
And where do all those voters go?

225
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,750
Where does 50% of Republicans go?
That really are at the end of the day.

226
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:01,434
And I was socially tolerant and fiscally
conservative and I think that is the 

227
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,560
majority of Republican voters.
But,

228
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:08,394
uh,
they've been co opted by the social 

229
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:11,484
conservatives that have an agenda that I
think is really a turnoff to most of 

230
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:16,614
America.
And it's okay to be a social 

231
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,624
conservative.
There's nothing wrong with being a 

232
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:20,970
social conservative,
but if you,

233
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,900
if you equate or if you make that public
policy,

234
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:28,140
if you pass laws regarding social 
conservatism,

235
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:31,110
you end up putting people in jail for 
personal choices.

236
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:35,730
And we do have the highest incarceration
rate of any country in the world.

237
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,560
And I think that starts with the drug 
war.

238
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,480
The word conservative is interesting 
too,

239
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,314
when you apply it to social issues like 
social conservativism cause 

240
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:43,464
conservatives really wa the original 
conservatives were stay out of my 

241
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,180
business.
I'll stay out of yours.

242
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,193
So social conservative really wouldn't 
apply to like things along the of gay 

243
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,430
marriage

244
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,100
or same sex unions or anything along 
those lines.

245
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:57,934
You would,
you'd say we'll leave those people 

246
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,464
alone.
That would be the conservative approach 

247
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:03,100
that government should stay out of those
people's lives.

248
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:03,500
Right.

249
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,800
Well,
it started out as classical liberal.

250
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,270
Classical liberal is being fiscally 
conservative and socially liberal,

251
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,700
which got co-opted.
I mean that,

252
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,540
that used to be what a conservative was 
and that got co opted.

253
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,410
And,
um,

254
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
like I said,
I think we're a little bit of both.

255
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,890
You've heard the old adage that if in 
college you weren't a Democrat,

256
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:27,710
you didn't have a heart.
And if a,

257
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:29,810
as an adult,
you weren't a Republican,

258
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:31,280
you didn't have a brain.
Well,

259
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,180
I think we've got both.
All of us have got both of those things.

260
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,313
Yeah.
It's just real polarizing to have only 

261
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:38,904
two choices.

262
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,580
Well,
and it's,

263
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,400
and it's so polarizing because the,
those issues,

264
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,420
um,
at the,

265
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:45,430
at the end of the day,
um,

266
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,623
why can't Democrats and Republicans come
together on some very common sense 

267
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,750
issues that would move the country 
before

268
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,840
ward?
Well,

269
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,570
decades ago,
the term libertarian was very,

270
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:59,330
very rarely used.
When was it invented?

271
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,220
And I think we would all agree that it's
at least something discussed today.

272
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,370
So 71 is when the libertarian party was 
established.

273
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,960
And I remember in [inaudible] 71 and,
uh,

274
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,623
I graduated from high school in 
[inaudible] 71 and I remember getting a 

275
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,930
book that said,
here's what it is to be a libertarian.

276
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,110
And it was a very short read,
uh,

277
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,640
read the book.
And,

278
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,710
uh,
clearly I was a libertarian.

279
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:27,544
I've identified myself as a libertarian 
since now have I registered as a 

280
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:32,110
libertarian?
Um,

281
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,500
no,
but back to the book or read the book,

282
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:40,210
it said pass the book on as I had had it
passed on to me and for me,

283
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,133
uh,
I've identified myself as such since I 

284
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:46,060
think it's very typical that,
um,

285
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,020
well in New Mexico,
I remember in the eighties,

286
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,520
early eighties,
there was a congressional debate,

287
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,383
Republican,
Democrat and the Libertarian and the 

288
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,110
discussion in the bar afterwards when 
something like this who won the debate,

289
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,063
well,
there's just this overall consensus was 

290
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,810
the libertarian won the debate,
but who are we going to vote for?

291
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,930
Because the libertarian never wins,
right?

292
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,923
Yeah,
yeah.

293
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,460
That's the real rub,
right?

294
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,080
The,
throwing your vote away,

295
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,710
throwing your vote away and how can you,
uh,

296
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,603
I mean,
throwing your vote away is voting for 

297
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,700
somebody that you don't believe in.
That's throwing your vote away.

298
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:25,330
You vote for somebody you believe in and
that's how you change the system.

299
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,623
Yeah.
It's really become a stigma that has to 

300
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:31,530
somehow or another be removed publicly.
And um,

301
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,530
I just keep thinking that with each one 
of these fiasco elections,

302
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,680
that this idea of a third party will 
slowly but surely emerge and it seems to

303
00:14:42,411 --> 00:14:43,730
be gaining ground

304
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,320
and it could be this cycle,
but so far,

305
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:48,150
no,
I mean it hasn't had what happened.

306
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,710
Yeah,
well it's the TV,

307
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,290
it's the TV thing,
man.

308
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,143
I those

309
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,170
debates,
they're so bizarre.

310
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,033
It's such a strange show.
Or one person says something and the 

311
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,604
other person standing there shaking 
their head and not agreeing and then 

312
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:04,640
they enter jacked or they go over their 
time and the other person jumps in.

313
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,050
It's one of the worst ways ever to get 
your point across and,

314
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,540
but it,
I agree,

315
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,880
but if you're not in those debates,
you,

316
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:16,850
you were a non entity.
You have no chance.

317
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:18,290
I mean that's a,
that's a,

318
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,600
you know,
a seal of approval if you will.

319
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:24,350
It's a seal of credibility that you're 
on the stage in the first place.

320
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:26,360
And if you're not on the stage,
you don't have a chance.

321
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,120
So a lot is riding on this Bruce Fein 
lawsuit,

322
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,350
you believe?
No,

323
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,184
I'm actually,
what everything is riding on for me is 

324
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:38,840
being in the polls.
If I am in the national polls,

325
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:43,340
I'm back to the Mickey analogy,
but Mickey's not on the ballot in all 50

326
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:43,850
states.

327
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,683
So the justification of having me in the
polls is it then I am on the ballot in 

328
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:48,854
all 50 states.
And I really do think that I represent 

329
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:51,884
the majority of Americans.
I'm offering up proof of that with this 

330
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,290
ice side website.
People say to me,

331
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,670
why should I vote for you?
Well,

332
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,730
how about about getting online and 
seeing where you're,

333
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:05,450
where you are at philosophically with 
those people running for president.

334
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:06,284
I mean,
don't you owe it to yourself to find 

335
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:09,284
out,
um,

336
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,410
who lines up with what it is that you 
believe in?

337
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,270
That's a rational approach.
It's a very rational approach and people

338
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:20,600
owe it to themselves.
It's just fascinating that we look,

339
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,200
nobody really knew who Bernie Sanders 
was until this election.

340
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:25,880
It wasn't something that was in the 
public eye.

341
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,200
I mean,
if you knew about him,

342
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:28,034
he knew of him as a senator,
but no one knew a lot about him until 

343
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:32,444
this cycle.

344
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,160
Yup.
And then when you,

345
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,560
when you go down the litany of his 
issues,

346
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,540
like I say,
I,

347
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,613
I,
I agree with the guy three quarters of 

348
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:42,730
what he has to say,
but what I'm saying to the exit,

349
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:44,430
to the point of a economics,
that's,

350
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,510
that's the real proof that this is a 
locked up system.

351
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,110
Because if you were in those debates 
with all those people,

352
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:51,944
and during the same time,
most likely a lot of people would be 

353
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,640
looking at you and go,
you know,

354
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,220
this Gary Johnson guy makes a lot of 
sense.

355
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,483
And what you point out is,
is absolutely correct in that every 

356
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:06,560
single republican on stage was a social 
conservative.

357
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,130
And when it comes to the Democrats,
um,

358
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,370
look,
well both parties are well intentioned,

359
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:15,230
but when it comes to Democrats,
look,

360
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,064
they do grow government.
And I really believe that a bigger 

361
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:21,590
government,
although it's well intentioned,

362
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:25,700
at the end of the day,
it takes tax money out of my pocket that

363
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:26,534
I could be spending on my life as 
opposed to the government spending that 

364
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:29,930
money.

365
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,220
Ideally you'd,
you know,

366
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,054
you'd,
you'd take your money and you'd be able 

367
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:35,560
to donate it to a,
just exactly where,

368
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:38,390
where you wanted that money to be spent 
ideally.

369
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,640
And I realized that that's not practical
at all,

370
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,683
but that's a really good point that the 
fact that the larger the government 

371
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,234
gets,
the more money it cost to keep that 

372
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,273
going.
So the idea that it's going to do 

373
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,130
better,
who's going to do more,

374
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,720
there's more government is more people,
there's more programs,

375
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,300
but they cost more money and then then 
it just,

376
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:56,250
it becomes a point of diminishing 
returns.

377
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,980
And at the end of the day,
statistically it doesn't help.

378
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,280
Um,
and,

379
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,770
and that isn't to say,
you know,

380
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:05,970
I'm in the camp that believes that there
are those people that are truly in need,

381
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,980
but I think we've gone way over the line
when it comes to people in need.

382
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,413
And at the end of the day,
if we continue the growth of government 

383
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,360
and taxation,
uh,

384
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,540
at the end and printing money,
at the end of the day,

385
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,200
we're going to suffer from horrible 
inflation at some point.

386
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,063
This is my belief.
Do we have a fighting chance against 

387
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,600
what,
what is the worst,

388
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:33,780
most insidious tax of all,
which is inflation,

389
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:35,190
which erodes the,
you know,

390
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:36,024
you're,
you're buying capacity for the money 

391
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:40,110
that you earn.
There's nothing worse than inflation,

392
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:40,944
but that's what we're looking at if we 
don't actually just get some common 

393
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:47,130
sense a at the helm.
Now when you say,

394
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,500
um,
those in need,

395
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,380
like particularly or specifically what,
what programs are,

396
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,450
what's in place right now that you don't
agree with?

397
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,920
Don't agree with.
Yes.

398
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,933
I don't know.
Is there's anything that I really don't 

399
00:18:58,321 --> 00:18:59,154
agree with.
It's just within the context of those 

400
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,170
programs,
you have lines drawn for eligibility.

401
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,950
Should there be cell phones?
And I just use this as an example.

402
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,830
Should those people on welfare have cell
phones?

403
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:12,930
While the argument is,
is that uh,

404
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,680
without a cell phone,
you can't be connected to a job well,

405
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,240
is it,
does it really mean a job?

406
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,660
And I,
I point that out just as a,

407
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,960
this was a line drawn that this is now 
a,

408
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:25,620
um,
uh,

409
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,453
a benefit of being on welfare.
A benefit of being on welfare is that 

410
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:32,590
you get a cell phone of benefit of 
welfare is,

411
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:34,440
is that yeah,
you get a cell phone.

412
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,423
So there's an allotment or an allowance 
for cell phone usage or something like 

413
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:39,324
the federal government spends multi 
billions of dollars a year on cell 

414
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:47,010
phones for those on welfare.
Hmm.

415
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:47,970
No,
I,

416
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,490
I just point that out as,
gee,

417
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:51,324
is that really,
is that really a function of government 

418
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,750
and a,
wouldn't people be connected?

419
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,170
Uh,
the notion that if you can work,

420
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:03,840
you should work.
The notion that if,

421
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:06,450
let's say the government is giving you 
$100,

422
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,793
these are very theoretical figures,
but let's just say the government's 

423
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:13,590
giving them $100 a month and,
and you can't work.

424
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:15,690
If you work,
you're going to lose the hundred dollars

425
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:18,990
a month.
What about the notion of if you work,

426
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,790
the government will give you 75 bucks 
and you can make a hundred bucks.

427
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,990
So at the end of the day you're working 
and you make $175.

428
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,330
Um,
it doesn't that make sense.

429
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:35,331
Little less money from the government 
incentivizing you to actually go out and

430
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:36,474
get a job.
It is as simple as what I'm talking 

431
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:43,590
about having done the exact same thing 
in New Mexico.

432
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,503
Um,
the supreme court ruled that what I did 

433
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,780
administratively was unconstitutional 
and,

434
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,850
and what did,
what was the exact ruling?

435
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,410
Like what did you do?
Well,

436
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:57,340
what we did is just exactly what I just 
now said is,

437
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,203
okay,
so the government is giving you $100 a 

438
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,874
month.

439
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,713
How about the notion that if few there 
that there's a requirement that if you 

440
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:05,590
can work,
you will work.

441
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,650
So now you can go out and make $100 
without getting penalize.

442
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,590
We,
so you were,

443
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,663
but without getting penalize,
you make $100 and instead of the 

444
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,560
government paying use $100 a month,
the government pays you $75 a month.

445
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:21,394
At the end of the day you've got a job 
and now you're getting $175 and I'm 

446
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:26,410
making sense here.
Yes.

447
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,960
Yeah.
So that's what we implemented.

448
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:29,794
All the help wanted signs in the state 
went down because everybody had to go 

449
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:33,484
out and get a job.
Now the legislature sued me immediately 

450
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:39,400
on the basis that what I was doing was 
unconstitutional,

451
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:42,820
that what I was doing needed to be 
passed by the legislature,

452
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:47,680
that it couldn't be an executive order.
And after six weeks of implementing this

453
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,650
program,
uh,

454
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,533
the Supreme Court in New Mexico ruled 
that what I had done was 

455
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:53,050
unconstitutional.

456
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,210
I'm not,
I'm not here to debate that,

457
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,020
but you know,
we kind of proved that what I was saying

458
00:21:59,021 --> 00:21:59,854
was correct.
They never did a back it up with 

459
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:05,560
legislation.
They could have overridden the courts by

460
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:08,680
just caudifying what we did in 
legislation.

461
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,630
Uh,
but they never did that.

462
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,760
So what you're saying is what you did 
was effective,

463
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,260
but they just ruled it unconstitutional 
and they never changed any of the rules.

464
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,760
Exactly.
Exactly.

465
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:20,680
Is that frustrating for,
you know,

466
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:21,970
I mean it's a,
you know,

467
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:25,300
it's the three branches of government.
I am very,

468
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm very reality based.
Um,

469
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,650
you know,
this is,

470
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,290
this is the power that the executive 
has,

471
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:36,550
the power power of the executives.
The executive gets to run government now

472
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,760
within the bounds of a legislation.
You know,

473
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:41,980
it is three branches of government.
And I,

474
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:44,110
I respect that and I understand it.

475
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,550
Um,
it's just,

476
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,670
it is the nature of the beast,
but you should,

477
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,983
that shouldn't,
that should never dissuade you as an 

478
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:54,940
executive from doing what you think is 
right.

479
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,050
Uh,
and,

480
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:57,970
um,
in many cases,

481
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:58,804
like I say,
that's where the court step in and 

482
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:01,930
that's where the legislature will step 
in.

483
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,980
It should have been legislated.
So if,

484
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,850
if it was effective and it was proven to
be effective.

485
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:07,684
Yeah.
Well w all the help wanted signs in the 

486
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:12,400
state went down for six weeks and then 
immediately on this ruling,

487
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:14,260
all the help wanted,
signs went back up.

488
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,663
But I mean,
realistically though with a real actual 

489
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:17,944
numbers of like unemployment being down 
and you could show it and bring it to 

490
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:22,420
them.
Well,

491
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,253
if you did,
what was the argument against what you 

492
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:26,110
did well that,
uh,

493
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:31,111
that they did not that what I did needed
to be legislated as opposed to executive

494
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:34,990
action,
but once it was proven to be effective,

495
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,580
what would you would think that that 
would be?

496
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,830
So I was a Republican governor in New 
Mexico,

497
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,730
two to one democrat.

498
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,033
Uh,
one of the big surprises I've had a 

499
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,690
having served as governors,
I,

500
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:52,524
oh,
really naive Lee thought at the end of 

501
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,943
the day,
Democrats and Republicans would come 

502
00:23:55,851 --> 00:24:00,500
together over issues that were right,
meaning do the right thing as opposed to

503
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:03,950
lining up politically.
So in this case,

504
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,740
um,
they lined up politically and um,

505
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,530
and,
and never pass the legislation that,

506
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,350
and six weeks was not,
I mean,

507
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,930
I,
I say anecdotally,

508
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,640
all the help wanted,
signs went down.

509
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:20,360
They did go down,
but really not enough time to garner the

510
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:21,194
statistics that could have made that in 
fact a national program emulated by 

511
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:27,770
other states because we would have shown
success doing it.

512
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,560
Here's one for you,
Joe.

513
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,790
So,
so welfare in New Mexico,

514
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,693
um,
I had a health insurance policy as 

515
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,460
governor of New Mexico.
Okay.

516
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,440
I mean,
this is given to me.

517
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,030
This is,
this is a perk.

518
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,923
Being governor,
I have a health insurance policy covers 

519
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:48,620
me and my family is governor of New 
Mexico.

520
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,840
We took all the welfare recipients in 
the state and uh,

521
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:58,130
which were a quarter of a million and,
um,

522
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,030
200,000 people.
And did the math,

523
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,893
gee,
what if we gave all of them my health 

524
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:06,464
insurance policy as opposed to just 
paying the bills when it came to 

525
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:12,110
welfare?
Get it.

526
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:12,944
I mean,
everybody on welfare would receive my 

527
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:17,780
insurance policy as governor of New 
Mexico.

528
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,830
Would we really save 20%?
Uh,

529
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:23,150
yes,
we did that.

530
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,980
We did that.
And that's what happened.

531
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,840
And as comedy saved 20%.
Yeah.

532
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,450
And Save 20%.
Um,

533
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,930
and to this day that is still,
that is still in place.

534
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:33,764
That was moving from a fee for service.
Meaning if you were on welfare and you 

535
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:39,650
went to the hospital or you went to the 
emergency room,

536
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,013
uh,
Bill was sent to the State Medicaid and 

537
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:45,854
the state paid that bill.
Three quarters of that bill got picked 

538
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,004
up by the federal government and one 
quarter of it gets picked up by the 

539
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:53,210
state,
but that's a medicaid.

540
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,640
Um,
and by switching to a,

541
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,720
an insurance model or a managed care 
model,

542
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,380
um,
we save 20% on the whole bill.

543
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,400
I mean,
it's just common sense,

544
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,720
uh,
to the Max.

545
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:11,480
I mean just really flabbergasting

546
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,650
now when you look at things like 
obamacare and the criticism of obamacare

547
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,270
and you look at what you were trying to 
implement in your own state,

548
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,570
wha what do you think could have been 
done differently?

549
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,020
Well,
um,

550
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,420
I think that a welfare,
uh,

551
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,430
and uh,
medicare,

552
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:28,264
so healthcare for those over 65,
I think the federal government needs to 

553
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:34,630
devolve both of these services to the 
states.

554
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,120
Now,
currently of course,

555
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,003
um,
healthcare for those over 65 is 

556
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:42,700
completely federal.
But in my heart of hearts,

557
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:43,980
if the government would have

558
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,750
blocked granted,
New Mexico,

559
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:48,090
a fixed amount of money,
uh,

560
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,010
just kept,
by the way,

561
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:50,844
this is just runaway expenditure.
This is the worst runaway expenditures 

562
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:56,250
in federal government today is Medicaid 
and Medicare.

563
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,760
But if they would have just kept it or 
the historical increased being 7%,

564
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,204
if they'd had just given a couple of 
percent increase to the state of New 

565
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,120
Mexico as opposed to let's say 7% and 
said New Mexico,

566
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,590
Governor Johnson,
you are in charge of healthcare delivery

567
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,390
to those that are poor,
uh,

568
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,910
welfare and those,
uh,

569
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,920
health care to those that are over 65 in
my heart of hearts,

570
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,330
I believe that I could have delivered 
that are seen over the administration of

571
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:28,350
the delivery of that healthcare.
So if you did,

572
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:29,184
if the federal government did that,
and that's the only way to reform 

573
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:34,050
Medicaid and Medicare is devolve it to 
the states,

574
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,950
50 laboratories of innovation,
best practice,

575
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,150
there would be some fabulous success 
that would get emulated.

576
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,760
There'd be horrible failure that would 
get avoided.

577
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,840
But as opposed to one size fits all the 
federal government,

578
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:49,674
we'd actually,
we'd actually come up with solutions on 

579
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:54,810
how to cap and,
and how to,

580
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,380
uh,
main or contain the costs within,

581
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,233
uh,
within the system talking about Obama 

582
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,350
care.
Um,

583
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,460
what we really need when it comes to 
healthcare is just free market solutions

584
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:09,294
to healthcare.
And by in healthcare is as far removed 

585
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:15,474
from free market right now as it 
possibly can be in a free market system 

586
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:21,300
for healthcare,
we would have,

587
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:22,134
we would not have health insurance to 
cover ourselves for ongoing medical 

588
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:26,484
need.
We would have health insurance to cover 

589
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:31,290
ourselves for catastrophic injury and 
illness.

590
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,650
And we would pay as you go in his 
system,

591
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:38,340
that would probably cost about one fifth
of what it currently costs.

592
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,473
We would have gallbladders are us,
we'd have gallbladder surgery for 

593
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:46,980
thousands of dollars as opposed to tens 
of thousands of dollars.

594
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:50,030
We'd have stitches are us,
we'd have x-ray's Aros,

595
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,383
we'd have the radiologist's,
next two s x rays are us to read those 

596
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,290
x-rays.
Um,

597
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,693
and at the end of the day we would pay 
out of pocket for those services and 

598
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:06,060
they would be a fifth of what they 
currently are.

599
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,140
So in a sense,
what you're saying is that right now the

600
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,710
medical health care is kind of being 
subsidized by the government?

601
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,913
Well right now it's almost like an 
unrealistic amount of money is being 

602
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:18,500
spent on it.
Is that what you're saying?

603
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,130
Well,
right now health insurance would be like

604
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:24,080
having grocery and insurance.
Hey,

605
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,680
you got grocery insurance,
a I go to the,

606
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,514
uh,
I go to the supermarket and there's no 

607
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:32,950
prices on any of the shelves cause I got
grocery insurance.

608
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:36,640
It doesn't matter what anything costs.
Am I going to buy a hamburger?

609
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,411
Well,
why you,

610
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:41,020
why should I buy hamburger when I have 
grocery insurance and I can buy a,

611
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,020
right.

612
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,853
But in the one of that logic,
like what does anyone doing differently 

613
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:45,874
because they have health insurance.
It's not like they're getting extra 

614
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:49,390
treatments.
Well,

615
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:51,400
so in the,
well right now,

616
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,610
um,
chief justice Roberts when he said that,

617
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:56,490
um,
that uh,

618
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,393
obamacare was attacks on people.
My personal insurance premiums have 

619
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:05,590
quadrupled and I have not been to see a 
doctor in three years.

620
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:06,424
I mean,
I,

621
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,413
so it's a tax for me.
I'm subsidizing those that aren't 

622
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,410
healthy.
Um,

623
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,663
I wish I didn't have to have insurance 
to cover myself for ongoing medical 

624
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,800
need.
Look,

625
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,340
we go into the hospital right now.
There's no advertised pricing.

626
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:23,410
You have no idea what you're going to 
pay.

627
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,220
There is no statistics on,
on the wall that say,

628
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:29,200
Hey,
if you're here for gallbladder surgery,

629
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:33,670
you can expect a 99% outcome.
There's none of that.

630
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,490
If you had a free market approach to 
healthcare,

631
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,900
you would have all of that.

632
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,320
You'd have advertised pricing and you 
would have a,

633
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:43,990
um,
outcomes based on,

634
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:44,920
on,
uh,

635
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:46,120
on prior,
uh,

636
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:46,954
patients that had gone in.
But there is an issue with people that 

637
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:52,270
do have injuries,
whether it's a catastrophic injury,

638
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:53,104
whether it's some sort of a disease that
comes up where the amount of money that 

639
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:56,494
they're going to have to spend for 
healthcare can be catastrophic and 

640
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,630
astronomical.
And that's,

641
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,553
I started out by saying we would not 
have insurance to cover ourselves for 

642
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:05,974
ongoing need,
but we would have insurance to cover 

643
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:10,270
ourselves for catastrophic injury and 
illness.

644
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,490
But how do you define what's 
catastrophic and what's not?

645
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:13,990
Like if you get cancer and dollar 
amount,

646
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,440
dollar amount.
Yeah.

647
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,850
What about the health consequences of 
avoiding or not avoiding treatment?

648
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,940
Because there's going to be a lot of 
people that don't have the money and are

649
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:26,050
going to just deal with certain issues 
like a surgery perhaps that you need and

650
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,190
you're just going to avoid it.

651
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,080
Knee surgery,
things along those lines,

652
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,810
like I said,
considered catastrophic.

653
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,501
Well,
yes,

654
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,900
absolutely.
Beyond a certain dollar amount.

655
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:35,734
I mean these,
these are the things that you could 

656
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:37,564
choose in a,
in a genuine free market approach to 

657
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,740
health care.
What about like a meniscus scope,

658
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,860
like a meniscus scope?
Meniscus tears can be incredibly painful

659
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,850
if you,
you know,

660
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,780
get scoped a few thousand dollars,
would that be considered catastrophic?

661
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:50,614
It's not really catastrophic engine.
Well today it's a few thousand dollars 

662
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:58,150
because it's one of those no advertise 
pricing for meniscus tear.

663
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:01,480
And having had several meniscus tears 
myself,

664
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,333
uh,
if you had a free market approach to 

665
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:05,740
healthcare,
you would have meniscus.

666
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:08,770
Tears are us,
we specialize in meniscus tears,

667
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:10,380
here are our outcomes.
And uh,

668
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,673
you can come in and get a meniscus tear 
surgery for what would end up to be 

669
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,200
hundreds of dollars as opposed to 
thousands of.

670
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,170
So sort of like the way they do like 
lasik eye surgery today.

671
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,900
Great example.
Advertise pricing,

672
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,850
cosmetic surgery,
uh,

673
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,140
you know,
dentistry now,

674
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:26,974
I mean you're starting to see advertised
pricing and as opposed to the hundred 

675
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,130
dollar ass than that,
when you go into the hospital,

676
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:33,964
when you read the fine print,
but of course you're not paying for it 

677
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:37,900
so you don't care.
So in that sense,

678
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:40,280
you would essentially go to a hospital,
they would diagnose

679
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,031
you,
they would tell you,

680
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:41,864
here's the issue.
You have to get a gallbladder and then 

681
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:45,230
you'd go to gallbladders are us.

682
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,060
Well or just from the very beginning,
right?

683
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,980
What's wrong?
What's wrong with me?

684
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:50,814
I mean you,
you'd man with the Internet today and 

685
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,530
there could be so much innovation.
Why,

686
00:32:56,531 --> 00:32:57,720
why do we even,
and I'm,

687
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,540
I am talking about a utopia,
if you will,

688
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:03,630
and I don't want to say utopia.
This is very doable.

689
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,260
This is something that a government 
could really lay the groundwork for a,

690
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,113
but that it's like I say,
as far removed from what I'm talking 

691
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:13,510
about,

692
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,390
fiscally conservative.
When you say fiscally conservative,

693
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:19,300
when you talk about issues like welfare 
and things along those lines,

694
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:21,670
people get a sense,
a lot of people do,

695
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,940
um,
that you are perhaps callous or uncaring

696
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:28,970
about poor people.
That that's the route.

697
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,780
I'm not saying

698
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,051
no,
no,

699
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:30,884
no,
but that is,

700
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,363
but in our own lives,
look its best pr in our own lives as 

701
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,760
best product.
It's best service at the lowest price.

702
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,050
That's,
that's how we,

703
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,080
that's how we analyze things.
We don't give away our own money.

704
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,270
Why?
Why should government be giving?

705
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,730
Why shouldn't government have the same 
credo?

706
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,943
Well,
what I was going to get at was what 

707
00:33:48,911 --> 00:33:51,820
you're saying as far as like the 50 
states.

708
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:57,490
That is probably one of the most 
interesting thing about having 50 states

709
00:33:57,491 --> 00:34:01,840
is that you can have 50 different 
experiments and you have 50 different,

710
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:06,220
and we're seeing that of course with 
legalized marijuana in Colorado bringing

711
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:09,340
in more tax revenue than alcohol for the
first time ever.

712
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,593
I mean this is a huge thing that's 
happening right now in Colorado and 

713
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:14,374
experiment in government.
And the federal government tried to 

714
00:34:17,231 --> 00:34:19,750
block it at one point and they were very
concerned with it,

715
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,584
but now they're letting it go and it's 
proving to be incredibly financially 

716
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:24,154
beneficial to that state.
Now you're seeing Seattle or Washington 

717
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:28,660
state,
Washington,

718
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,330
DC,
other states are starting to join in and

719
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:34,810
it's going probably go nationwide within
the next decade or so.

720
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,360
Yeah.
This is a perfect example,

721
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:39,220
right,
of states coming up with an experiment,

722
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:40,054
the experiment proven to be fiscally 
effective and then moving forward with 

723
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:43,700
it

724
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,533
and Colorado probably have,
has done the best job when it comes to 

725
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:50,960
the recreational states.
Washington state has done the worst job.

726
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,823
Uh,
meaning that the taxes are so high in 

727
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:55,860
Washington state,
uh,

728
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,713
that the black market is alive and well.
How hard is the taxes in Washington 

729
00:34:59,421 --> 00:35:04,421
state to Colorado's 39% in Washington 
state?

730
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:06,290
Well,
a Washington state,

731
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,610
they'll have an whatever the rate is 
though it applies four times.

732
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,350
It,
it applies to growing,

733
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:15,190
it applies to processing.
It applies to every single.

734
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,850
So that at one point,
two summers ago,

735
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:20,684
right after Washington state implemented
it and that a pot went on sale at one 

736
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,290
point,
marijuana in,

737
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,124
uh,
in Washington state was selling for 26 

738
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:32,930
grand a pound.
What?

739
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,010
$65 a gram.
That's insane.

740
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,920
Well,
for

741
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,770
what you had,
you had people lined up around,

742
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:41,604
not around the block.
People who'd never used marijuana 

743
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,574
before.
Well everybody that had been using 

744
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:47,034
marijuana continued to get it on the 
black market because that was and is 

745
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,930
insane.
Well,

746
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:55,080
and these are the regulations as far as 
personal growing.

747
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,750
Yeah.
In some states.

748
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:58,530
But,
uh,

749
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,860
to me that's also a common sense.
I'm,

750
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,703
I'm caveat to this legislation is they 
need to allow for home grow this the 

751
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,450
same way you get your groceries.
I mean,

752
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:11,920
it really should be no different if you 
want to grow your own tomatoes.

753
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,570
Exactly.
And grow your own standards.

754
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,690
And,
and I've always said that this,

755
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:16,870
you know,
we always talk about,

756
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,590
or everybody is talking about the tax 
revenue,

757
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:20,850
which is,
which is correct.

758
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:21,684
It's significant,
but more significant than the tax 

759
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,420
revenue is the savings in law 
enforcement.

760
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:27,960
The courts.

761
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,793
And the prisons.
We have the highest incarceration rate 

762
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:32,514
of any country in the world and the 
reason behind that is that the war on 

763
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:37,494
drugs,
we've got tens of millions of convicted 

764
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:41,154
felons in this country that,
but for our dog drug laws would 

765
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:48,330
otherwise be tax paying law abiding 
citizens and the drug war.

766
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,210
That is a,
that's a huge factor.

767
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,300
That's a huge factor in distrust and law
enforcement.

768
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,163
It's a huge factor in frustration with 
the system feeling disenfranchised with 

769
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:01,140
the the very system that's supposed to 
be governing us.

770
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:03,930
You just feel like it's your enemy.
Black lives matter.

771
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,320
At the heart of that is the drug war.
That's the heart of that.

772
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,390
At the heart of the militarization of 
our police forces is breaking down doors

773
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:13,224
in the name of confiscating drugs and a 
lot of that has been recently revealed 

774
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:21,060
with started off during the Nixon 
administration as just trying to control

775
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:21,894
the civil rights movement and trying to 
control the antiwar movement the way 

776
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:24,990
they did it.

777
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,180
They recognize that these people using 
marijuana,

778
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,670
let's go after them.
Let's make it a big deal.

779
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,533
Well,
one of those political boogeyman that a 

780
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:33,774
as a politician elect me and I will save
you from the ills of marijuana right 

781
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:40,840
now.
Another one of those political boogeyman

782
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,190
is immigration and it's a political 
boogeyman look.

783
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:49,250
Immigration is really a good thing.
They're not taking jobs that US citizens

784
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:50,634
want and it's not an issue of lower pay 
unless it's an issue of language and 

785
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:56,070
they're the first ones that recognize 
that.

786
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:58,770
And building a wall across the border is
just crazy.

787
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,020
What can be done at this point?
Like if someone became a president,

788
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,320
what could be done to stop this influx 
of private prisons,

789
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,183
this,
this prison industrial complex that we 

790
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:13,290
were finding ourselves in this horrible 
quagmire with?

791
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,030
Well,
so don't,

792
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,130
don't mistake.
Look,

793
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,110
it's not just private prisons.

794
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,830
It's public prisons.
That number one opposition to legalizing

795
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:25,890
pot in California was the public prison 
union.

796
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:29,280
So yeah.
You know it's guards union,

797
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:30,150
correct?
Yes.

798
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,180
It's keep jobs.
They want to keep jobs.

799
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:36,690
We've got 2.3 million people bars.
Um,

800
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,530
that's terrifying.
That's terrifying.

801
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:39,364
That guards would want to keep jobs so 
that they would want more people locked 

802
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:45,010
up for things that no one agrees with.
That's really scary.

803
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,820
I'll,
I'll just,

804
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,820
I'll just say it's a bad rap for private
prisons as opposed to just prisons,

805
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,090
period.
There's a,

806
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,120
there's a big,
I said,

807
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:57,100
as governor of New Mexico,
um,

808
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,940
and I privatized half the state prisons 
in New Mexico,

809
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,730
apples to apples,
oranges to oranges.

810
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:08,370
The private prisons offered up the same 
goods and services for two thirds.

811
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,223
The price and all that because they're 
not the government because they can do 

812
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:17,980
it for less money,
just like every aspect of life.

813
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,933
Private to can do it better than public.
Every aspect of life isn't the issue 

814
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:25,270
though with something like a private 
prison.

815
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,870
So this is a private corporation that 
profits from incarcerating people,

816
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,780
amazing that they,
that they can even profit and offer.

817
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,850
So in New Mexico,
if I may,

818
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,333
when I took office,
there were 800 prisoners housed out of 

819
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:38,914
state.
There had been massive prison riots in 

820
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:42,484
New Mexico so that the federal courts 
were in charge of the prisons in New 

821
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,250
Mexico is called the Duran consent 
decree.

822
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,690
The legislature refused to appropriate 
money to build new prisons.

823
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,110
It was a huge problem that we had.
So the private prison camp,

824
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,330
private prisons,
Wac,

825
00:39:58,331 --> 00:39:59,164
and Hud in particular came in and said,
and the federal courts were running the 

826
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:07,360
prisons in New Mexico.
So if what I'm about to tell you,

827
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,223
if you think that we were going to get 
away with any less goods or services 

828
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:16,030
being delivered to the prison industry 
guests,

829
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:16,864
again,
federal courts are running the prisons 

830
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:23,050
in New Mexico on an apples to apples,
oranges to oranges basis.

831
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:27,430
Instead of 100 bucks a day,
they offered it up for 66 bucks a day,

832
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:28,960
two thirds,
the cost.

833
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,110
If that isn't good government,
I don't know what is.

834
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:36,880
And in New Mexico I constantly said if 
we would adopt rational drug laws,

835
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:37,714
if we could let people out of prison,
it will be a lot easier to empty the 

836
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:44,410
private prisons than it will be the 
public prisons.

837
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,910
Well,
excuse my ignorance on this,

838
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:46,744
I'm not sure if I'm right,
but I would imagine that something like 

839
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:49,714
a private prison,
which is a company and it's a company 

840
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:55,390
that companies 10 to aspire towards 
growth,

841
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,380
and when you have a private prison that 
profits off of people being in jail,

842
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,243
you would attend to think that they 
would try to maximize their potential 

843
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:05,860
for growth or versus the government,
right?

844
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,460
It's logical.
But May,

845
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,780
maybe the component in here that you're 
missing is,

846
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:13,540
is as opposed to growth.
Just think of it as,

847
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,523
as stepping in and taking over the 
services that are currently being 

848
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,454
provided for a lot less money,
meaning taking over all the prisons and 

849
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:24,620
that would be their growth.
So all presents.

850
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,230
Exactly.
And,

851
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,940
and assuming,
and this is,

852
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:31,210
this is my experience now,
and don't get me wrong.

853
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:32,430
I mean there's,
it's,

854
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,040
there's just logic

855
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,110
behind,
gee,

856
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,540
if you're a private prison,
then you're in it for the money.

857
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,640
Right?
That's logical.

858
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,620
But it's,
in my experience,

859
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,950
it's completely removed from the 
reality.

860
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,540
But just in your experience in New 
Mexico,

861
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:50,790
in New Mexico,
fairly small state,

862
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:53,010
well not small,
but it doesn't have a large population.

863
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,570
Right.
And,

864
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:59,830
and excuse me,
have there been,

865
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,110
um,
you know,

866
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,530
a private prisons that lobby for more 
prisoners?

867
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,840
I'm not going to say that that hasn't 
happened.

868
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:10,630
Didn't happen.
Did Not happen in New Mexico,

869
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,793
but just don't discount that,
that's not happening on the public side 

870
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:16,940
also

871
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,080
of course.
Right,

872
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,060
exactly what you're talking about with 
the unions,

873
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:20,894
the guard unions,
they are trying to somehow another 

874
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,340
maximize their potential and maximize 
their growth

875
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,310
and this mandatory sentencing,
which really starts,

876
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,950
uh,
with the drug laws that we have.

877
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:33,380
I mean,
this is the reason why we have this high

878
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:34,470
incarceration rate.
Yeah.

879
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,120
That we have.
How is it legal that these prison unions

880
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,910
actually do that?
Well,

881
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,990
what's that squeak?
Is that you?

882
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,940
Yes,
it is.

883
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,560
Let's try to figure out what it was.
Yeah,

884
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,220
no legal though.
That,

885
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:53,054
how is it legal?
Guardians can try to change laws and 

886
00:42:56,541 --> 00:43:00,260
which where it's so transparent.
It's not like they're trying to lock bad

887
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:01,094
people up because they're really 
concerned about the safety of the 

888
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:04,070
public.
They're worried about their jobs.

889
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,993
So they want to incarcerate people that 
may or may not be incarcerated without 

890
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:09,380
their,
their input.

891
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,800
Joe,

892
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,200
you,
you nailed it.

893
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,540
Just extend that to other things that we
see also.

894
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,440
For example,
you see ads on television that say,

895
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,673
um,
increase the expenditures for education 

896
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:24,830
that's being paid for from a tax 
dollars,

897
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:26,600
from mud,
from teachers,

898
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,220
right?
That will advertise for that.

899
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,413
We see advertisements all the time from 
public institutions that in essence 

900
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:38,030
we're paying for,
for increased funding all the time.

901
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:40,340
Every time we turn around.
How is that fair?

902
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:45,341
How is that legal?
Isn't that a manipulation of our brains?

903
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,200
Uh,
you know,

904
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,330
in a,
in a way that,

905
00:43:48,331 --> 00:43:49,164
uh,
many times just belies the underlying 

906
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:54,800
logic that no,
they shouldn't get more money,

907
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,120
they should get more efficient.

908
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,813
Well,
the issue though is this is very 

909
00:43:59,081 --> 00:43:59,914
different because you're talking about 
people lobbying to try to lock up other 

910
00:44:02,711 --> 00:44:05,530
human beings for their own profit.
Well,

911
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,730
um,
like I say,

912
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:10,930
your logical,
what you're saying is logical.

913
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:12,670
It's,
it's got a perfect logic,

914
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,980
kind of it's evil.
I mean,

915
00:44:14,981 --> 00:44:16,360
if you really think about it,
if they,

916
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,373
if there's a brewpub,
people of the massive amount of the 

917
00:44:20,051 --> 00:44:20,884
general public doesn't believe that 
people should be in jail for a lot of 

918
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:25,360
the drug crimes are in jail for,
especially marijuana.

919
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,373
If you look at the statistics,
you look at the amount of money that's 

920
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:29,530
being spent on it.
Most people would say,

921
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:31,770
this is fucking crazy.
We've got to stop this.

922
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:32,663
Right?

923
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,370
I'd say I've been more vocal about this 
than anybody in an elected office.

924
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,680
So when prison unions lobby contrary to

925
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:40,990
prison unions,
yeah,

926
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:46,330
prison unions,
now you're public or either side of it,

927
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:47,610
lobbies

928
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,443
four,
four,

929
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,070
four more lock.
Contrary to public opinion,

930
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,710
there should be an investigation and it 
should be criminal.

931
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,693
I mean,
what you're doing is you're lobbying to 

932
00:44:55,751 --> 00:44:56,584
try to go against the,
the wishes of the general public to put 

933
00:44:58,961 --> 00:44:59,794
people in jail,
and there's only one reason it's to 

934
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:02,674
maximize profit.
You're not talking about any threat to 

935
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:05,104
the public.
You're not talking about any healthcare 

936
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,113
threat.
You're not talking about any tax burden 

937
00:45:08,651 --> 00:45:11,350
from people out there smoking marijuana 
was selling marijuana.

938
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,260
What you're talking about is maximizing 
your profit as a guard.

939
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,210
That should be illegal

940
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,240
spot on.
Uh,

941
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:23,241
I would just ask everybody listening to 
just apply that same argument to a whole

942
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:26,700
lot of other things that we're exposed 
to when it comes to.

943
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,853
So let's talk about if you,
if you apply that same argument to 

944
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,410
education,
what is it,

945
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:34,580
what's your take on that?

946
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:40,210
Well fit back to 50 laboratories of 
innovation and best practice.

947
00:45:40,211 --> 00:45:43,690
The federal government should not be 
involved in education at all.

948
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:44,524
And very quickly,
federal government gives each state 11 

949
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,460
cents out of every school dollar that 
every state spends,

950
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,610
but it comes with 15 cents where the 
strings attached.

951
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,440
The federal government says,
here,

952
00:45:56,441 --> 00:45:58,750
we're going to give you 11 cents and you
have to do a,

953
00:45:58,751 --> 00:45:59,471
b,
c,

954
00:45:59,471 --> 00:46:01,930
and d to get the 11 cents.
What are those?

955
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,790
What are those steps they have to do?
Well,

956
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:08,530
one of those steps is now providing 
transgender bathrooms.

957
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:09,483
Um,
as the Obama administration has now 

958
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:13,570
stated,
if you don't,

959
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,370
if you,
if you,

960
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,850
well this is,
this is reality.

961
00:46:15,851 --> 00:46:18,040
Now if you,
if you don't provide these bathrooms,

962
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:18,874
you're not going to get your 11 cents.
So do they have to have a third 

963
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:22,150
bathroom?
Was that the,

964
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:25,540
it was that this well make,
make accommodation.

965
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:30,310
Now this perfect example is they say 
that you have to do a,

966
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:31,330
b,
c and d,

967
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:35,470
Use the transgender bathroom as the,
as the latest and greatest front page.

968
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:37,720
Here's what the federal government is 
requiring,

969
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,080
but it costs you as a state 15 cents to 
deliver on getting the 11 cents.

970
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,480
It actually is a negative to take 
federal money.

971
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,900
So abolishing the Federal Department of 
Education,

972
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:54,730
which I think people think was 
established under George Washington when

973
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:57,700
it was established under Jimmy Carter.
Um,

974
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,593
tell me what really has been value added
when it comes to the Federal Department 

975
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,790
of Education since,
uh,

976
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,850
since the 80s.
And so when it was him,

977
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,090
well let's talk about that one step 
because it,

978
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:08,933
is there any benefit at all to being 
open minded and trying to get people to 

979
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,530
discriminate against transgender people 
last,

980
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:21,030
or is this some sort of a political hot 
topic that the government has latched on

981
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:21,864
to try to get people to think that 
they're progressive and they're moving 

982
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:26,640
towards the right direction?
Because I mean,

983
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:28,080
how many people are we,
well,

984
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:29,350
it's the latter.
It's,

985
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:29,980
it,
it's been

986
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,640
a nonissue.
It's not been an issue our entire lives

987
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,480
for certain individuals in certain 
environments

988
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,330
and they've been accommodating 
themselves this whole time throughout,

989
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,800
throughout our lifetimes.
Um,

990
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:44,623
there should be,
I think there's absolute a heightened 

991
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:48,130
awareness.
But,

992
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,360
um,
look,

993
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:51,400
this is,
this is overkill.

994
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,170
This should,
this should be an issue that,

995
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:54,004
uh,
Los Angeles deals with the state of 

996
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,223
California deal.

997
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:57,263
Correct me if I'm wrong,
cause we were actually discussing this 

998
00:47:58,770 --> 00:47:59,603
yesterday.
I believe what North Carolina has said 

999
00:48:00,721 --> 00:48:01,554
was that you have to use the bathroom 
that corresponds to the gender on your 

1000
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,860
birth certificate.
However,

1001
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,200
if Gary Johnson,
you decide at 50,

1002
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:08,034
how old are you,
sir?

1003
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,413
63 63 if you decide at 63 years old,
you want to be a woman that's a Bruce 

1004
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,190
Jenner did,
right?

1005
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,550
Yeah.
If you decide you want to be a woman,

1006
00:48:14,551 --> 00:48:15,384
you could change your birth certificate.
Your birth certificate literally can be 

1007
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:19,710
changed to say that you're a woman,
then you can use the women's room.

1008
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,840
So that's all they're requiring.
And so this up in arms is really like,

1009
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,733
they want it commitment,
I think before you decide to go and use 

1010
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:30,084
the women's room,
like you literally have to just go and 

1011
00:48:31,831 --> 00:48:34,590
get your paperwork changed.
Is that correct?

1012
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,501
No,
no.

1013
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:38,380
I no disagreement,
but I'm,

1014
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,370
am I am a correct technically.
Yeah.

1015
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,170
That's it.
That is what they're requiring.

1016
00:48:42,171 --> 00:48:46,160
Right.
But when I think of of that bullshit,

1017
00:48:46,161 --> 00:48:46,994
if you will,
a over an issue that has never been an 

1018
00:48:49,701 --> 00:48:52,660
issue before.
As governor of New Mexico Joe,

1019
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,503
I may have vetoed more legislation and 
the other 49 governors in the country 

1020
00:48:57,321 --> 00:48:59,300
combined.
Where's this coming from?

1021
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,450
Where's it coming from?
So if I,

1022
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:02,001
well,
it's,

1023
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:02,834
it's,
uh,

1024
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,800
it's discrimination against the lbgt 
community.

1025
00:49:06,801 --> 00:49:11,240
That's the heart of all of it.
As governor of North Carolina,

1026
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:13,190
if I had had been governor of North 
Carolina,

1027
00:49:13,191 --> 00:49:17,000
I'd have vetoed that legislation.
This is much to do about nothing.

1028
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:19,410
This is not an issue.
Um,

1029
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,533
and certainly the federal government 
shouldn't be stepping in and doing this 

1030
00:49:23,391 --> 00:49:26,990
because North Carolina right now is 
suffering the wrath,

1031
00:49:26,991 --> 00:49:29,090
if you will,
or the whole country that says,

1032
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:29,924
we're going to boycott North Carolina.
We're going to have nothing to do with 

1033
00:49:31,911 --> 00:49:35,840
North Carolina as a result of them 
having passed this legislation.

1034
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:36,723
But again,
what they're saying in passing this 

1035
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:39,334
legislation is not that complicated.
They're just saying that you have to 

1036
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,200
change your gender on your birth 
certificate.

1037
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:45,550
Right?
I mean,

1038
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:46,384
it may be discriminatory at heart,
but when you look at the actual 

1039
00:49:50,051 --> 00:49:52,480
paperwork,
like what's required in order to use the

1040
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:53,314
women's room,
like it's not saying that you have to 

1041
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:57,910
have an x,
y chromosome to use the men's room.

1042
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,360
They're saying you have to identify as a
male on your birth certificate.

1043
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,570
So if a woman decides to become a man of
transition to a man,

1044
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:07,630
she decided she's a man at heart and she
changes that under birth certificate.

1045
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:08,464
They don't do a chromosomal test on her.
So it's just a matter of a paperwork 

1046
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:12,190
change.
I'm not,

1047
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:13,024
I'm not really sure how much less you 
could require of someone to use a 

1048
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:21,370
different bathroom that corresponds to 
the gender of their birth.

1049
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,920
Well,
I would just,

1050
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:25,783
I would just disagree that the 
government taken a role here that I 

1051
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,140
agree we never had to be established.
Right.

1052
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,093
I agree with that.
But if you do want to discourage 

1053
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:36,270
discriminate against discrimination 
against transgender people,

1054
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,830
how would you go about encouraging that?
Or is that just a social issue,

1055
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,080
social issue that needs to be worked out
with people?

1056
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:43,911
Well,
it's a,

1057
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:45,980
it's an issue that needs to be worked 
out,

1058
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,650
uh,
municipality state wide.

1059
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,520
But,
uh,

1060
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:51,180
at the end of the day,
um,

1061
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,830
this issue has existed our entire 
lifetimes.

1062
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,730
And have there been any reported 
incidents of anything anywhere?

1063
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:00,560
I'm not aware of any incidents any,

1064
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,673
well,
I'm sure there's been something and I'm 

1065
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:04,050
sure some people feel maligned,
but,

1066
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,840
uh,
I just don't know if necessarily there's

1067
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:11,841
enough demand to require a law change 
and what all this Hullabaloo is about,

1068
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,460
about this law change.
When I discuss it with people and I'm,

1069
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:16,703
I try to be as open minded as humanly 
possible when it comes to people's 

1070
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:21,234
choices and what they want to do,
whether it's regarding gender or sex or 

1071
00:51:23,431 --> 00:51:24,480
whatever you want to do.
Me Too.

1072
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,590
I'm just,
I'm,

1073
00:51:25,591 --> 00:51:27,120
I'm fine with it,
but my,

1074
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,053
my issue with this is I feel like it's a
chance for people to jump up and say 

1075
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,833
that they're outraged.
I think it's almost like a recreational 

1076
00:51:36,271 --> 00:51:38,130
outreach thing.
Like when I heard that Bruce springsteen

1077
00:51:38,131 --> 00:51:40,680
was boycotting North Carolina,
all these people jumping up and like,

1078
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,620
is that really the way to go about this?

1079
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,790
Yeah,
I think so.

1080
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,290
I mean that is the way to go about it.

1081
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:47,163
Just stop.
So you're saying it in terms of like 

1082
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:51,890
government's gotten too big,
you want to stop this law?

1083
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,820
Yeah.
The way to go about is to boycott.

1084
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:56,130
The still way to go about it is boy cat.
The stage,

1085
00:51:56,131 --> 00:51:56,964
just like a happened in Arizona when Jan
brewer started to talk about vilifying 

1086
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:01,734
Mexican immigration and uh,
and conventions and the whole country 

1087
00:52:06,301 --> 00:52:09,240
was boycotting Arizona.
And when it came to,

1088
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:09,930
um,
you know,

1089
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,190
traveling there,
I mean,

1090
00:52:11,191 --> 00:52:12,630
it happened right?
And,

1091
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,310
and it,
and because of that,

1092
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:14,911
uh,
you know,

1093
00:52:14,911 --> 00:52:16,990
the change took place.
North Carolina,

1094
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,833
same thing.

1095
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,343
So,
so really what's unnecessary in your 

1096
00:52:21,091 --> 00:52:22,740
eyes?
You're a small government guy.

1097
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:23,603
What's unnecessary?
Is the government getting involved at 

1098
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:25,090
all

1099
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,080
at all,
at all?

1100
00:52:26,081 --> 00:52:28,210
In this case,
and don't get me wrong,

1101
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:32,350
government has a fundamental role to 
protect us against individuals,

1102
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:33,670
groups,
corporations,

1103
00:52:33,671 --> 00:52:35,770
foreign governments that would do us 
harm.

1104
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,490
And,
uh,

1105
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,460
I'm running for president of United 
States.

1106
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,390
Um,
I'd like to think that a,

1107
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,970
at the end of the day,
I'm going to,

1108
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,420
I'm going to sign on to anything that 
makes things better.

1109
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:47,823
Uh,
transgender law in front of me as 

1110
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:53,470
governor and the state of North Carolina
or president of United States.

1111
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:54,850
You know,
you make that analysis.

1112
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:55,684
Is this going to make things better or 
at the end of the day is it just going 

1113
00:52:57,881 --> 00:52:58,714
to add time and money to our lives and 
not really do anything to plays devil's 

1114
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:05,710
advocate?
Is there any benefit in having it in the

1115
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:08,420
news is any benefit?
Absolutely.

1116
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,230
Right.
So people,

1117
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:10,870
you'll

1118
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,910
become more and more aware of it.
I mean,

1119
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:16,930
I think whether or not you look at 
Caitlyn Jenner as a,

1120
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:20,530
a real issue in this country.
I think what the issue is is that people

1121
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,364
were becoming more aware that there are 
folks out there that don't necessarily 

1122
00:53:23,591 --> 00:53:26,280
fit necessarily with our standard

1123
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,680
idea of what gender is.
They,

1124
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:30,210
they're,
they're all over the place.

1125
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,210
There's people on the far right and the 
far left just like politically.

1126
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,050
Yup.
Yup.

1127
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,610
And a,
at the end of the day,

1128
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:38,340
aren't most of us absolutely tolerant of
that?

1129
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,650
Most of us.
Yeah.

1130
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,670
And then people start there.
The real issue,

1131
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:42,240
right?
Yeah.

1132
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,073
The people that are intolerant of other 
people's choices that don't affect you 

1133
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:45,924
at all.
And the intolerant folks are the ones 

1134
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:50,190
that are passing this legislation.
Okay.

1135
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:52,800
So the intolerant ones,
the ones who are saying enough is enough

1136
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:56,340
with all this transgender nonsense.
You can't use the women's room if you're

1137
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:58,740
a man much to do about and nothing but 
the seed.

1138
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:00,660
There's some men,
it's,

1139
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:01,890
it's,
it's so,

1140
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:06,150
it's so confusing in some ways because 
they were as outliers on both sides.

1141
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:10,080
Like I have met transgender women who 
without a doubt,

1142
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,160
I would consider them a woman.

1143
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,270
I mean,
it looks like a woman.

1144
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:15,270
She talks like a woman has sensibility 
is like a woman dresses like a woman.

1145
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,620
Whatever the fuck that means.
Right?

1146
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:17,783
But then on the other side,
I've seen there's this guy that 

1147
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:20,903
identified,
we were talking about this guy recently 

1148
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,970
identifies as a woman,
has a beard,

1149
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,190
a has a penis,
doesn't want to have a sex change,

1150
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:28,020
doesn't take hormones,
identifies as a woman.

1151
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:28,854
Once it,
we use the women's room and he's been 

1152
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:31,510
doing it.
No,

1153
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,340
no he hasn't.
But he wants to.

1154
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,420
And it was one of the,
it's an outlier.

1155
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,980
But you know,
you're dealing with,

1156
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,070
there's all sorts of people when any 
issue like this comes up,

1157
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:42,840
right?
And you're going to have rational,

1158
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:44,160
logical,
obvious choices.

1159
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,320
And then you have like,
what do you do with that guy choices

1160
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,750
and where does that decision making best
lie,

1161
00:54:50,751 --> 00:54:54,290
that decision making best lies in the 
municipality,

1162
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,300
um,
where that person lives.

1163
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:57,134
And if it's an issue,
let's say an albuquerque and I'm the 

1164
00:54:58,941 --> 00:55:01,160
mayor of Albuquerque,
um,

1165
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,523
welcome to come into the boys room.
If you're welcome to come into the boys 

1166
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:10,310
room,
boys room can be labeled transgender and

1167
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:12,050
boy's room as far as I'm concerned.

1168
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:15,970
Hmm.
So the only worry there would be if they

1169
00:55:15,971 --> 00:55:18,100
went into the boys room,
they were discriminated against,

1170
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:23,400
but then show how many people going the 
males

1171
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,401
boys room though.
See,

1172
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:25,990
I think it'd be less of an issue.
This,

1173
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,790
this is,
this is knee jerk of course.

1174
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:28,751
And,
and it's,

1175
00:55:28,751 --> 00:55:30,370
and it's based on,
uh,

1176
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,840
let's,
let's have,

1177
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,800
instead of having a one size fits all,
uh,

1178
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:38,110
how about let's work this out at the 
absolute lowest level.

1179
00:55:38,111 --> 00:55:41,500
We can work it out and maybe we'll come 
to some real,

1180
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,740
you know,
a monumental,

1181
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:45,880
uh,
oh,

1182
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,920
you know,
epiphany's on how to do this.

1183
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:48,783
What would possibly be the epiphany.
I think that's one of the problems with 

1184
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:51,660
this issue.
Yeah.

1185
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:52,600
Okay.
But,

1186
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,680
but um,
you know,

1187
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:54,514
that's you and I thinking about this and
if you had a municipalities thinking 

1188
00:55:57,701 --> 00:55:58,534
about it all across the country,
some of them would come up with 

1189
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:00,903
solution.
You'd be some best practices that would 

1190
00:56:02,231 --> 00:56:04,450
emerge from this.
That would make sense for everyone.

1191
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,261
Well,
the,

1192
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,570
the all the only suggested than I've 
ever heard.

1193
00:56:07,571 --> 00:56:10,750
That makes any sense at all.
Is it three bathroom rule like male,

1194
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,890
female,
whatever.

1195
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,851
Well,
but male,

1196
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:14,080
female and go for it.

1197
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,310
Well,
and imagine,

1198
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:16,263
um,
imagine all schools in this country 

1199
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:22,010
having to be ref retrofitted with that 
third bathroom.

1200
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,150
I'm talking billion.

1201
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,530
$100 billion.
I'm just guessing.

1202
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,730
Well yeah,
it's a lot of money.

1203
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,460
Let's just say a lot of money and the 
federal government's going to give you a

1204
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:35,230
11 cents for you to accomplish their 15 
cents where the mandate.

1205
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,840
Yeah,
it's,

1206
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,340
I liked the issue.
You know why I liked the issue?

1207
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:41,890
Cause it's so bizarre and there's no 
answer.

1208
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,780
I love when something has no answer.
When you just sit around going,

1209
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,633
man,
I don't know.

1210
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,580
Right.
Cause people will take sides and they'll

1211
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:49,414
run with their side and make sure that 
you think that their side is the only 

1212
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:54,970
solution whatsoever when there really 
isn't an only solution.

1213
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,190
Profound.
Yeah,

1214
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:58,300
it's,
it's a weird one,

1215
00:56:58,301 --> 00:57:01,640
right?
You're back this weekend back to fiddle.

1216
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,440
Well it's,
it's something to fiddle with.

1217
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,293
I mean,
this is a fiddling sort of a 

1218
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:09,790
conversation because it's,
it's polarizing.

1219
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,410
It's confusing.
And again,

1220
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,030
I'm not right.
You're not right.

1221
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:15,430
There's no right on this.
This is a weird thing.

1222
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,800
Look,
the whole transgender thing is weird.

1223
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,450
It's very rare.
I mean,

1224
00:57:19,451 --> 00:57:20,284
you're talking about,
is it even 1% of people that become 

1225
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:23,410
transgender?
I doubt it.

1226
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,540
It's probably far less than it's 0.03% 
of.

1227
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:29,790
So it's,
yeah,

1228
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,950
it's,
it's a very small amount of 3% of 1%.

1229
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,630
Very,
very small amount.

1230
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:36,850
It varies.
So a mandate,

1231
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:37,620
because

1232
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,453
Hola kids,
couple of kids out of thousands of 

1233
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:43,560
students.
That's kind of a cheesy way to look.

1234
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:44,583
And wouldn't it be better for everyone 
if we just became more open minded and 

1235
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:51,190
more friendly and loving and let people 
do whatever the fuck they want to do.

1236
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:51,740
Let,
let the,

1237
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,160
the,
the man who identifies as a woman,

1238
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:55,360
let them,
you know,

1239
00:57:55,361 --> 00:57:57,220
use the woman's room if he actually 
looks like a woman.

1240
00:57:57,221 --> 00:57:59,200
But if you have a beard,
maybe we should play aside and go,

1241
00:57:59,201 --> 00:58:00,310
dude,
you can use the men's room.

1242
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,420
Just your freaking people out.

1243
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:05,130
You probably spent as much time or more 
time than I have in Europe,

1244
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,890
but uh,
you know what the showers are.

1245
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:09,690
Um,
showers are men and women.

1246
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,690
It's men and women.
Bathrooms.

1247
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,190
I don't shower in Europe and some 
gigantic prison,

1248
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:15,953
prison showers.
You going to serve men and women 

1249
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:18,270
showers.
Yes.

1250
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,133
Open showers.
These recreational facilities in 

1251
00:58:22,351 --> 00:58:24,740
virtually every single,
uh,

1252
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,830
a mountain community in a,
in the Alps for example,

1253
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:31,110
like skiing communities,
like they have open showers.

1254
00:58:31,111 --> 00:58:31,891
Well,
in this case,

1255
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:32,724
you know,
they've got,

1256
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,430
they've got the,
they've got these marvelous,

1257
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,350
um,
recreational facilities.

1258
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:41,430
It seems like in every town and in those
towns,

1259
00:58:41,431 --> 00:58:42,264
you know you've got a swimming pool and 
you got the showers and the showers are 

1260
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,350
men and women both.
Now as a person who has got,

1261
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,850
there's no choice.
There's no choice.

1262
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:53,880
I'm back to Europe now.
I mean this is a really different,

1263
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:57,600
it's just this kind of a thing is not an
issue in Europe.

1264
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,520
I'm going to imagine.
Well,

1265
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:01,860
that would require a gigantic cultural 
shift though.

1266
00:59:01,861 --> 00:59:03,960
We're very used to segregating male and 
female,

1267
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,610
but awareness.
So here it is.

1268
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:11,130
We're spreading awareness that,
oh shoot.

1269
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,230
Uh,
Europe,

1270
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:17,040
they shower together.
Your wife has to shower with some dude.

1271
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,200
Like trust me,
that's not going to fly.

1272
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,620
Well let that go and fly.
It flies.

1273
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,090
It flies in Europe,
a lot of stuff flies and you're right,

1274
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:27,710
it doesn't fly over here.
Might not necessarily be a good thing.

1275
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,800
You can't trust American men with 
American women in a shower together.

1276
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,560
Well,
but in Europe where you've grown up with

1277
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:36,080
that your whole life,
there aren't any incidents.

1278
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,760
We're not going to grow up with that 
though.

1279
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:38,571
Right?
Well,

1280
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:40,580
we haven't grown up.
It's not going to change.

1281
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:41,453
You're not going to,
that would be even more ridiculous to 

1282
00:59:43,131 --> 00:59:45,110
adjust the way children growing up and 
say,

1283
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:46,940
listen kids,
everyone's gonna shower together.

1284
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,350
Parents would freak out.
They'd be like,

1285
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,960
what kind of government is this?
J Well,

1286
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:53,630
Gary Johnson's a psychopath awareness,
you know,

1287
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,220
as you were talking about earlier,
just that people be aware that there are

1288
00:59:58,221 --> 01:00:01,070
all sorts of different ways of doing 
things.

1289
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,353
There's also drink drinking.
I mean we can go down several 

1290
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:07,280
cul-de-sacs here,
but in Europe,

1291
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,060
you know,
uh,

1292
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:12,020
you can kids start drinking at the 
earliest of age.

1293
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:15,650
I mean like as in four or five years old
and so and so.

1294
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:16,484
They know what alcohol is from a very 
young age and so they don't have near 

1295
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:21,134
the issues with alcohol abuse.
They ended up getting their driver's 

1296
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:28,940
licenses at 21 but they can drink,
you know,

1297
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:31,250
with the,
with the consent of their parents,

1298
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:32,630
you know,
at four years old.

1299
01:00:32,631 --> 01:00:37,631
And so they understand the impact of 
alcohol and now they drive a 21 well,

1300
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:42,410
here in this country you can drive at 14
and I'm 14

1301
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,540
in this country.
It's 15,

1302
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,700
you get a learner's permit at 16 drivers
license.

1303
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,360
Is that what it is?
It's close to New Mexico.

1304
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:53,030
I mean it was 14 in New Mexico.
Really 13.

1305
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:53,864
I had that motorcycle license at 13.
You could drive a motorcycle in New 

1306
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,760
Mexico at 13.
Now as a person

1307
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,800
governance state.
Um,

1308
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,753
and you look at the,
what happens when someone gets an 

1309
01:01:05,191 --> 01:01:05,850
office,
when,

1310
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:08,160
when Obama gets an office,
he promises all these things,

1311
01:01:08,161 --> 01:01:09,990
gets an office,
changes almost everything.

1312
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,900
Um,
what are the hurdles,

1313
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:13,973
I mean,
what are the differences between the 

1314
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,504
hurdles of someone who governs a state 
versus someone who governs the United 

1315
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,153
States?
And how much more difficult is it to 

1316
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:25,230
change things?
It seems like the United States is like,

1317
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:30,470
like a gigantic ship that takes so much 
effort to shift even slightly that these

1318
01:01:32,281 --> 01:01:33,114
presidents get out of office eight years
later exhausted looking like they've 

1319
01:01:36,391 --> 01:01:38,790
aged 50 years and very little gets done.

1320
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,793
Well,
uh,

1321
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,920
I think there is a silver bullet to the 
system and I,

1322
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,960
I hope I'm tying into what you're 
saying,

1323
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:46,794
but I do think there's a silver bullet 
to the system and that would be term 

1324
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:50,020
limits.
Um,

1325
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:53,070
I think that for the most part of 
politicians,

1326
01:01:53,071 --> 01:01:57,580
once they get an office,
the main concern is to stay in off.

1327
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,940
Right.
And if you had term limits,

1328
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:04,440
I think that people would do the right 
thing as opposed to whatever it takes to

1329
01:02:04,441 --> 01:02:07,530
get to me for Congress and for the 
Senate Congress,

1330
01:02:07,531 --> 01:02:09,780
Senate shipping point,
even anywhere,

1331
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:10,643
right.
Well,

1332
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:13,050
supreme court's a,
another topic,

1333
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,460
but uh,
but certainly elected office agreed that

1334
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:20,370
we have it for the president one have it
for all elected offices.

1335
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,120
I think I'm the best example of term 
limits.

1336
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:23,983
I really enjoyed the job.
I had the opportunity to serve for two 

1337
01:02:27,561 --> 01:02:29,090
terms.
So I,

1338
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:33,890
in my estimation,
I pressed the limits term one,

1339
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:36,680
but not to the point where I wasn't 
going to get reelected.

1340
01:02:36,681 --> 01:02:40,730
And then when I get reelected,
I started off by saying,

1341
01:02:40,731 --> 01:02:41,564
you know,
let's examine the drug war in this 

1342
01:02:43,011 --> 01:02:43,844
country.
I started off by saying that the 

1343
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:50,000
marijuana should be legalized taking on 
what I thought at the time was,

1344
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,140
and it still remains.
So as one of those really fixable things

1345
01:02:54,141 --> 01:02:56,300
in our lives,
um,

1346
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,610
that would make the world a better 
place.

1347
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:01,250
Um,
but because of term limits,

1348
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:03,800
um,
I was emboldened because I,

1349
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,813
man,
I was getting out of office and there 

1350
01:03:05,901 --> 01:03:06,734
was no return.

1351
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:08,240
Right.
Um,

1352
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,320
what are your thoughts on all the other 
recreational drugs?

1353
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:13,840
Not just marijuana,
but the more controversial ones,

1354
01:03:13,841 --> 01:03:17,860
like maybe cocaine or Psilocybin,
lsd,

1355
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:18,790
things along those lines.

1356
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:22,330
So when I was governor of New Mexico,
I had a,

1357
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,530
um,
uh,

1358
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:26,710
I went to Portland,
Oregon and judges in Portland,

1359
01:03:26,711 --> 01:03:27,544
Oregon.
There were judges that wanted to meet 

1360
01:03:28,781 --> 01:03:29,614
with me in Portland.
And so I went to meet with these judges 

1361
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:35,170
and I didn't know what the,
what it was going to be about,

1362
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:37,840
but it was six judges,
Portland,

1363
01:03:37,841 --> 01:03:40,990
Oregon State district judges.
I'm sure I'm getting the wrong label.

1364
01:03:40,991 --> 01:03:42,700
But what they said was,
was,

1365
01:03:42,701 --> 01:03:43,930
hey,
governor Johnson,

1366
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,460
we just,
we're here to tell you,

1367
01:03:45,461 --> 01:03:48,310
we completely agree with everything it 
is that you're saying,

1368
01:03:48,311 --> 01:03:52,180
but we would like to share with you some
stories here that,

1369
01:03:52,181 --> 01:03:53,014
um,
maybe you can pass on to others that 

1370
01:03:54,971 --> 01:03:57,970
will allow others to better understand 
the drug issue.

1371
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:01,960
They said that the really horrible drug 
out there as methamphetamine,

1372
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:02,883
that people that use methamphetamine,
I'm really have their behavior altered 

1373
01:04:06,701 --> 01:04:07,900
and not in a good way.

1374
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,540
So it's really the Boogie drug out 
there.

1375
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,790
They said,
um,

1376
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:17,710
methamphetamine is the best example that
we can think of of a prohibition drug.

1377
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,550
It exists because it's cheap and it's 
easy to make.

1378
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,680
And what they said was,
was that,

1379
01:04:23,681 --> 01:04:25,630
hey,
we're not suggesting the following,

1380
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:26,883
but if cocaine were legal,
these people would be using cocaine 

1381
01:04:30,671 --> 01:04:35,290
instead of methamphetamine without the 
negative behavioral consequence.

1382
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:36,603
And that's true.
But if the government were to tell the 

1383
01:04:39,641 --> 01:04:44,500
truth when it comes to cocaine,
cocaine puts holes in your heart.

1384
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:45,873
People that use cocaine their entire 
lives are stereotypically Whitney 

1385
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,553
Houston,
the die before they're 50 because they 

1386
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:53,770
die of a heart attack from using 
cocaine.

1387
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:54,903
Now will there still be people that will
use cocaine knowing that they might die 

1388
01:04:58,391 --> 01:04:59,720
of a heart attack?
Um,

1389
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,293
I think,
I think there'd be less cocaine use if 

1390
01:05:03,851 --> 01:05:04,684
people actually knew the truth and could
trust government when it comes to the 

1391
01:05:07,511 --> 01:05:08,344
truth,
I just maintain that 90% of the drug 

1392
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,270
problem is prohibition,
unrelated,

1393
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:17,890
not use related.
And that is not to discount the with use

1394
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:19,690
and abuse,
but that should be the focus.

1395
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:23,230
When you have 8,000 deaths a year in 
this country,

1396
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,850
8,000,
which is staggeringly low due to cocaine

1397
01:05:27,851 --> 01:05:31,180
and heroin overdose.
And people will immediately say,

1398
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:32,014
well yeah,
the number is so low because it's 

1399
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:36,180
illegal.
No.

1400
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,280
Um,
you can argue that if it were legal,

1401
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,320
if quality quantity was known,
uh,

1402
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:46,360
it's arguable that those desks would 
significantly decrease.

1403
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:49,630
Although there will always be people 
that will commit suicide.

1404
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,150
Always

1405
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:52,970
be people that will push the limits.
Yes,

1406
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:53,893
you're,
you're always going to have people that 

1407
01:05:54,381 --> 01:05:55,700
abuse everything.
Everything,

1408
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:56,511
everything.
Everything.

1409
01:05:56,511 --> 01:05:57,344
I mean we're,
we're living in a culture that has 

1410
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:01,490
alcohol available at every block all 
over the world.

1411
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:02,361
I mean,
everywhere you go,

1412
01:06:02,361 --> 01:06:03,194
there's a restaurant or a bar or 
somewhere that you can buy enough 

1413
01:06:05,991 --> 01:06:09,050
alcohol to drink yourself to death.
It's readily available.

1414
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:12,830
Yet when you consider the amount of 
people that actually drink alcohol,

1415
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:13,670
the,
the,

1416
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,490
the low number of deaths is pretty 
incredible.

1417
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,480
And it's because we're aware of the 
effects of alcohol and it's pretty,

1418
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,810
when you get a bottle of Jack Daniel's,
it is pretty consistent.

1419
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:24,750
Well,

1420
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:28,710
uh,
but there are 100,000 deaths a year that

1421
01:06:28,711 --> 01:06:29,820
are contributed,
uh,

1422
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:30,540
that,
uh,

1423
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:31,373
get contributed to alcohol consumption.
And I'm not talking about drinking and 

1424
01:06:33,721 --> 01:06:34,554
driving or,
or violence committed under the alcohol 

1425
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:37,260
abuse,
alcohol,

1426
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,870
alcohol abuse.
Statistically,

1427
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,220
no one dies

1428
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,173
from marijuana.
So that was what I was going to get to 

1429
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:46,410
was that when you look at what's 
happening in Colorado,

1430
01:06:46,411 --> 01:06:47,244
one of the more interesting things is 
the lesson of violent crime and drunk 

1431
01:06:51,331 --> 01:06:52,164
driving.
Those are two effects that have dropped 

1432
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:56,370
pretty drastically,
noticeably,

1433
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:00,570
statistically because of the 
legalization of marijuana that you would

1434
01:07:00,571 --> 01:07:03,810
reduce because of the legalization of a 
less harmful,

1435
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,150
more peaceful drug.
You'd reduce the effects of uh,

1436
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:11,250
what's right now a readily available and
incredibly prevalent drug.

1437
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,833
I have always maintained that legalizing
marijuana will make for a better planet 

1438
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,210
on the medicinal side of marijuana.
Um,

1439
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:26,280
marijuana products directly compete with
legal prescription drugs,

1440
01:07:26,281 --> 01:07:27,114
pain killers,
antidepressants that statistically kill 

1441
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,400
100,000 people a year.
No,

1442
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:37,650
no documented death due to marijuana on 
the recreational side.

1443
01:07:37,651 --> 01:07:38,484
I've always maintained that legalizing 
marijuana will lead to less overall 

1444
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:43,164
substance abuse because people are going
to find it as such a safer alternative 

1445
01:07:46,951 --> 01:07:50,010
than everything else that's out there.
Starting with alcohol,

1446
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:54,060
the campaign to legalize marijuana in 
Colorado,

1447
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,173
uh,
was a campaign based on marijuana is 

1448
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,100
safer than alcohol.
And Joe,

1449
01:07:59,101 --> 01:07:59,934
as you were pointing out all the 
statistics that all the naysayers were 

1450
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:06,840
going to go south,
I have gone have gone better.

1451
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:08,563
They're less traffic incidents.
There's less overall crime in the state 

1452
01:08:12,331 --> 01:08:16,010
of Colorado.
Colorado is vibrant and does

1453
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,070
it have to do with marijuana?
I think that that's an ingredient,

1454
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:19,953
uh,
comprised in why Colorado is so vibrant 

1455
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:23,414
right now.

1456
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,150
Question,
blame,

1457
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:24,983
unquestionable.
And I think a prime example of how 

1458
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:28,563
screwy the system gets when people lobby
against the legalization of things that 

1459
01:08:33,481 --> 01:08:34,314
don't harm anyone is the fact that hemp 
is illegal federally and that we're 

1460
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:39,474
trying to make it legal and trying to 
make it legal statewide and in various 

1461
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:46,290
states and start production of hemp.
But hemp is not psychoactive.

1462
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,910
It's crazy.
We,

1463
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:48,983
we,
we can sell hemp products in this 

1464
01:08:51,181 --> 01:08:53,580
country,
but they come from China.

1465
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,190
My company,
we buy it or my company on it.

1466
01:08:56,191 --> 01:09:00,660
We buy it from Canada.
We buy hemp protein from Canada and they

1467
01:09:00,661 --> 01:09:02,640
can't grow it in America.
We can import it,

1468
01:09:02,641 --> 01:09:04,050
but we can't grow it.
CBD,

1469
01:09:04,051 --> 01:09:05,490
CBD oil.
Yes.

1470
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,160
Same thing.
Not psychoactive helps pain.

1471
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,760
Very effective for people.
It's not getting people hire,

1472
01:09:10,761 --> 01:09:13,200
it's not ruining lives is not doing 
anything.

1473
01:09:13,201 --> 01:09:14,034
But there's a lot of people that are 
concerned that are making money off of 

1474
01:09:16,831 --> 01:09:19,050
the alternatives,
especially with hemp.

1475
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,993
I mean,
that was the reason why marijuana was 

1476
01:09:20,881 --> 01:09:21,990
made illegal in the first place.

1477
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:22,873
That's the reason it was about hemp,
the conspiracy of dupont to promote 

1478
01:09:26,921 --> 01:09:29,590
nylon as opposed to,
uh,

1479
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,290
and,
and of course they,

1480
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,490
Randolph hearst,
they per factories,

1481
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,720
they made a,
they made a marijuana illegal,

1482
01:09:37,721 --> 01:09:42,610
but because the marijuana plant and the 
hemp plant look the same,

1483
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,040
then hence hemp was also made illegal.
I mean,

1484
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:46,874
that was the,

1485
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,320
the conspiracy.
Yeah.

1486
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,520
Well that's a,
I mean,

1487
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:50,810
that's all been proven.
So it's,

1488
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:51,703
we're in a strange time that it's 2016 
it's still illegal getting slowly 

1489
01:09:56,121 --> 01:09:58,180
starting to become legal and people 
starting to,

1490
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,350
I believe in Kentucky and a few other 
states,

1491
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:01,184
they're allowing farmers to profit off 
of this incredibly vibrant plant that's 

1492
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,700
easy to grow,
doesn't require pesticides,

1493
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,880
has a variety of uses as a textile,
as a commodity for food,

1494
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:17,030
a full amino acid profile.
It makes amazing clothes and making this

1495
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:18,830
jacket,
this is made out of hemp.

1496
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:19,880
I mean,

1497
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,820
if it's,
if,

1498
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:24,140
if the marijuana plant were discovered 
today in the Amazon,

1499
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:29,141
it would be hailed as the greatest 
discovery of humankind in 1999.

1500
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,450
Good News.
Bad News here.

1501
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:33,284
In 1999 I was the highest elected 
official in the United States to call 

1502
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:40,550
for the legalization of marijuana in 
2016 bad news,

1503
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,833
I'm still the highest elected official 
in the United States to call for the 

1504
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:45,014
legalization of marijuana.
Although Bernie Sanders apparently 

1505
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:49,400
rolled out of bed,
hit his head,

1506
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,400
and now he's come to that same epiphany.
Wonderful.

1507
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:53,263
I'm glad.
But in 1999 rolled out of bed and hit 

1508
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:56,684
his head aw,
well that he came to this epiphany at 

1509
01:10:58,941 --> 01:11:01,400
this point in his life.
He's never said it before.

1510
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,300
Uh,
no.

1511
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,930
Not until he's been running for a,
for Senate.

1512
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,830
So you think it's like one of those,
Lick your finger,

1513
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,590
put it up in the air,
check where the breeze is going.

1514
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,100
I'm glad that he's joined the big crowd,
but,

1515
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,243
but in 1999,
30% of Americans supported legalizing 

1516
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:18,384
marijuana in 2016,
60% of Americans now are supporting the 

1517
01:11:22,891 --> 01:11:23,724
legalization of marijuana and not one 
politician outside of Bernie Sanders in 

1518
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:30,030
office.
Um,

1519
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,353
is,
and when I say elected official at the 

1520
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:36,810
congressional,
senatorial or gubernatorial level,

1521
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,620
not one politician in that group outside
of Bernie Sanders,

1522
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,530
myself have a spouse legalizing 
marijuana.

1523
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,480
I think what a disconnect.

1524
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:46,383
What an incredible disconnect between 
what people think and our elected 

1525
01:11:49,451 --> 01:11:50,330
officials.
It's,

1526
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:54,180
it's also because when people take a 
stand on something that's controversial,

1527
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,033
it's,
it's risky and politics are about 

1528
01:11:57,251 --> 01:11:59,800
minimizing risk.
It's about getting people to like you as

1529
01:11:59,801 --> 01:12:00,634
much as possible,
going down the middle as much as 

1530
01:12:02,321 --> 01:12:04,420
possible term limits,
term limits.

1531
01:12:04,421 --> 01:12:07,210
I want to stay in office more than I 
want to do the right thing.

1532
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:08,373
Do you think that ultimately the idea of
having one individual that's the 

1533
01:12:11,531 --> 01:12:13,900
figurehead of an entire nation is 
archaic?

1534
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,700
No,
no.

1535
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:16,800
I,
you know,

1536
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,270
I,
I,

1537
01:12:18,271 --> 01:12:22,620
I'm certainly is,
is our system perfect?

1538
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,543
Uh,
no,

1539
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:24,340
but is it

1540
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,173
perhaps the best system?
So if we woke up to today and there was 

1541
01:12:27,851 --> 01:12:28,684
no government at all,
would you think that we would possibly 

1542
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:34,630
create one guy that runs the whole 
thing?

1543
01:12:34,631 --> 01:12:35,464
We would,
we would agree that that would be the 

1544
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:37,300
best way to run things.

1545
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,350
Um,
I have a theory that the best way to run

1546
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:41,640
things would be that,
uh,

1547
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:42,474
every 16 years we would have a 
benevolent dictator takeover for two 

1548
01:12:45,931 --> 01:12:48,450
years.
So what would happen,

1549
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:51,120
and those are the days,
the other 14 years,

1550
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,170
well,
the other six,

1551
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,153
16 years you'd have elected officials 
and then for two years you'd have a 

1552
01:12:56,411 --> 01:13:00,330
benevolent dictator step in and right.
All the wrongs that,

1553
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,740
but of course the problem is,
is well then how do you,

1554
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,070
how not sizeable someone could fake 
being benevolent,

1555
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,780
trying to be funny here,
but trying to bring out a point that,

1556
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:12,763
that actually,
that if you could have that benevolent 

1557
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:19,350
dictator step in and right the wrongs 
that elect,

1558
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:22,410
we don't live in a democracy in this 
country.

1559
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:26,040
It's not a democracy.
We live in a constitutional republic.

1560
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:29,280
We are a republic,
were governed by laws.

1561
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,143
The laws are the constitution.
We democratically elect our 

1562
01:13:33,901 --> 01:13:36,210
representatives.
But in a democracy,

1563
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:40,000
the demise of every democracy is,
is that,

1564
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,150
uh,
at some point in a democracy,

1565
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:46,170
people vote themselves a raise and it 
becomes unaffordable.

1566
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:47,543
Um,
Nazi Germany was a democracy before it 

1567
01:13:49,831 --> 01:13:52,230
became,
before Hitler took power.

1568
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,130
So what would be the,
I mean,

1569
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,450
besides your 16 year to year benevolent 
dictator,

1570
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:02,990
thanks.
What would be the way to fix the current

1571
01:14:02,991 --> 01:14:05,600
system?
Like say if Gary Johnson gets an office,

1572
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:06,853
what would you do?
What would be one of the first things 

1573
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:08,864
you did?

1574
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:09,321
Well,
I,

1575
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:12,010
I do think that government is too,
that it tries to

1576
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,720
accomplish too much,
uh,

1577
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:14,883
if,
if,

1578
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:20,010
if at a minimum a Gary Johnson were able
to just put a cap on spending the,

1579
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,590
uh,
the impact of that.

1580
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,480
When you consider,
um,

1581
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:26,973
when you consider the ultimate impact of
inflation and how that's going to kick 

1582
01:14:30,491 --> 01:14:33,910
in and how that's going to so adversely 
affect our lives,

1583
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:37,330
that would write a lot of wrongs because
you do have economic growth.

1584
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:39,200
You tie that with the fact that you just
put a,

1585
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,020
just,
I'm trying to,

1586
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:41,913
I'm trying to put the most minimal bars 
out there possible that would really 

1587
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:48,670
have a positive impact going forward 
from a,

1588
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:51,170
uh,
for my financial standpoint.

1589
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:55,570
And it isn't just financial,
it is about liberty and freedom.

1590
01:14:55,571 --> 01:14:58,450
It's about your liberty.
It's about your freedom.

1591
01:14:58,451 --> 01:15:01,210
It's about you making decisions in your 
own lives.

1592
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:06,660
It's about the fact that the government,
that crony capitalism is alive and well,

1593
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,044
that there are favors granted to those 
that have money as opposed to a level 

1594
01:15:12,431 --> 01:15:13,264
playing field that everybody would 
actually have an equal shot at the 

1595
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:18,730
opportunity that,
uh,

1596
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:20,103
that there currently is unavailable 
because of government and the actual 

1597
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,144
protections that exist for those that do
have money as opposed to those that 

1598
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:29,794
don't.

1599
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:34,190
So once you get into office,
how would you go about minimizing

1600
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,550
government?
Well,

1601
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,640
uh,
without any legislation whatsoever.

1602
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,533
Um,
and I am speaking now having been 

1603
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:45,330
governor in New Mexico for eight years,
I ran all of state government.

1604
01:15:45,331 --> 01:15:49,830
I pointed the heads of all the agencies.
And from that standpoint,

1605
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:52,800
the idea was was just to make things 
better.

1606
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,440
And what's the definition of better?
Well,

1607
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,693
that uh,
the average person on the street would 

1608
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:03,210
have to spend less time and less money 
dealing with government.

1609
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:06,930
And by spending less time and less money
on government,

1610
01:16:06,931 --> 01:16:07,764
that means that you would actually be 
able to pursue the things that were 

1611
01:16:10,321 --> 01:16:14,910
important in your life.
And that is not to minimize government's

1612
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:15,744
role,
which fundamentally is to protect us 

1613
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,920
against individuals,
groups,

1614
01:16:19,921 --> 01:16:22,100
corporations,
foreign governments that would

1615
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:22,953
do us harm.
So going back to what we had discussed 

1616
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,980
earlier,
that when government gets too big,

1617
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:28,510
you reach a point of diminishing 
returns.

1618
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:32,050
When it becomes to so swollen that it 
requires so much money to stay up,

1619
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,580
that it's just,
it doesn't,

1620
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:35,200
it doesn't support itself.
You,

1621
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,310
you,
it gets too large.

1622
01:16:36,311 --> 01:16:37,144
So what do you cut?
So say you get into office and you look 

1623
01:16:40,091 --> 01:16:40,924
at the current system we have right now.
You look at all the bureaucracy and the 

1624
01:16:43,421 --> 01:16:45,010
red tape.
What do you start to Chapo?

1625
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:46,543
Well what I did in New Mexico,
and I said I would do this when I went 

1626
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:52,880
in New Mexico,
is that I wasn't going to fire anybody,

1627
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:56,240
but let's just manage attrition.
Let's just have some common sense here.

1628
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:57,074
Let's not grow it anymore.
Let's just at a minimum it's not going 

1629
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:04,580
to grow anymore and it will shrink 
because there will be attrition.

1630
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:08,150
So how about the notion of a,
as people leave,

1631
01:17:08,151 --> 01:17:09,890
as people,
you know,

1632
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:13,580
quit retire that you just not backfill 
those positions.

1633
01:17:13,581 --> 01:17:18,530
And as so when I left off us,
there were 1200 fewer state employees.

1634
01:17:18,531 --> 01:17:19,364
And when I got there,
I think it was a testament to better 

1635
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:25,130
government because people were doing 
more,

1636
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,300
um,
with,

1637
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:27,163
with less resource.
And I think everybody saw that New 

1638
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,280
Mexico was a state that's two to one 
democrat.

1639
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,890
Um,
I made a name for myself,

1640
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:36,290
pinching pennies,
being frugal,

1641
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,960
just like we're frugal in our lives at 
least.

1642
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:40,130
I certainly am,
um,

1643
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,910
difference between cheap and frugal,
but I'm pretty frugal cat.

1644
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,340
So what do you do with something that's 
very controversial and often criticized?

1645
01:17:48,341 --> 01:17:49,174
Like Homeland Security?
Like there was an article that came out 

1646
01:17:50,891 --> 01:17:51,724
yesterday about homeland security going 
after the using homeland security to go 

1647
01:17:55,121 --> 01:17:59,950
after massage parlors for uh,
giving sex to people for,

1648
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,440
you know,
handjobs yeah,

1649
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:04,230
I would have never in the f in the first
place,

1650
01:18:04,231 --> 01:18:07,560
I would have never established the 
Department of Homeland Security.

1651
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,350
Now as president,
um,

1652
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,300
I either get to sign or veto 
legislation,

1653
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:13,163
I would sign legislation that would 
abolish the Department of Homeland 

1654
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,790
Security or I would merge it with the 
FBI.

1655
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:19,643
Just think we do have too many agencies 
and when you hear about a story like 

1656
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:26,790
homeland security going into a massage 
parlor,

1657
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:29,250
I,
I just get outraged.

1658
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,180
What causes that?
This is what I wanted to get to.

1659
01:18:32,181 --> 01:18:33,890
Like what,
how does that happen?

1660
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:34,724
How does homeland security,
something that's set up to prevent 

1661
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:37,453
terrorist attacks?
How does it eventually get bastardized 

1662
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:40,993
and distorted to the point where they're
utilizing the legislation that was put 

1663
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:44,924
in place to protect people from 
terrorist attacks to stop guys getting 

1664
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:51,560
handjobs.
It's human nature.

1665
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:52,680
It's the Peter Principle.

1666
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,860
It's when you're assigned to a job in 
government,

1667
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:02,160
the more important you are is the more 
work that you have.

1668
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:04,470
So you literally create your,
you,

1669
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:06,720
you create the work that you have,
you,

1670
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,920
you,
you,

1671
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,440
you try and expand.
You try and grow.

1672
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,210
Well,
that's the private sector,

1673
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:14,790
not the public sector,
public sector.

1674
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:17,220
People that get involved in the public 
sector.

1675
01:19:17,221 --> 01:19:20,730
They think that success is,
is growing their mandate.

1676
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:21,800
I mean it's just,
that's,

1677
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:24,060
it's that simple,
but someone has to approve that.

1678
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:25,820
Like someone has to say,
well,

1679
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,590
after the massage parlors,
sadly in this case,

1680
01:19:28,591 --> 01:19:30,180
where's the president of the United 
States,

1681
01:19:30,181 --> 01:19:33,750
the president of United States could 
step into this in a nanosecond and say,

1682
01:19:33,751 --> 01:19:35,220
Whoa,
stop.

1683
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:36,123
But is it possible that he's not aware 
of it because you're looking at it is 

1684
01:19:38,591 --> 01:19:40,780
possible,
but so many things to be aware of.

1685
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,790
Well,
it has governor of New Mexico.

1686
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,620
Here's something I did as governor in 
New Mexico on.

1687
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:45,454
It's something I would do as president 
of the United States as governor of New 

1688
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:49,323
Mexico.
I set up this open door after four 

1689
01:19:50,711 --> 01:19:51,544
policy where the third Thursday of every
month I saw anyone in the state of New 

1690
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,573
Mexico starting at four o'clock in the 
afternoon until 10 o'clock at the 

1691
01:20:00,011 --> 01:20:02,950
evening in the evening on five minute 
increments.

1692
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:04,383
And it was amazing Joe,
the stories of people that came in and 

1693
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:09,060
what they had to say,
now they could come in for anything,

1694
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,083
come in for a picture with me.
They come in to visit me with me for 

1695
01:20:12,361 --> 01:20:16,090
five minutes.
They could come in and talk about here's

1696
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:20,100
a government atrocity that's happening 
to me and I'd like you to fix it.

1697
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:21,960
And I always viewed it from the 
standpoint of,

1698
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:23,850
well,
this is one person that's come in,

1699
01:20:23,851 --> 01:20:24,540
but you know what?

1700
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:28,410
Everybody that's dealing with this same 
situation is having the same outcomes as

1701
01:20:28,411 --> 01:20:31,650
this person.
It was an incredibly valuable tool.

1702
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,113
As president of the United States,
I would set up an open door after four 

1703
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:40,170
policy for atrocities in government for 
a waste,

1704
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:41,004
fraud and abuse atrocities.
So door after four but you're talking 

1705
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:48,960
about 300 million people,
right?

1706
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:49,794
So we have an open door for five minutes
available for 300 million people in six 

1707
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,820
door.
Well this would,

1708
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:57,930
this,
this would be,

1709
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:01,350
there would be a criteria for it and it 
would be,

1710
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,780
um,
you,

1711
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,700
you could,
I,

1712
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:06,630
I'm,
I'm certain I could make this happen,

1713
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,760
but yes,
I'm certain that,

1714
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:11,070
I mean I think that's a great idea for a
governor.

1715
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:14,820
Maybe a better idea for a mayor.
But when you get to a precedent,

1716
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:17,820
is that really a way to what handles 
some things?

1717
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,090
So what is the mechanism?

1718
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:21,923
I'm just saying I think I can make this 
mechanism work that as a result of 

1719
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:25,914
having this mechanism,
I'm going to find out in a very short 

1720
01:21:28,201 --> 01:21:29,034
amount of time that the Department of 
homeland security is busting massage 

1721
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:32,870
parlors.
I'm gonna,

1722
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:33,723
I'm gonna put,
find that out just as easily through 

1723
01:21:35,161 --> 01:21:36,780
twitter.
Yes.

1724
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:39,330
And so I'm going to be connected that 
way too.

1725
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:40,950
But waste,
fraud and abuse.

1726
01:21:40,951 --> 01:21:41,784
The Marine One helicopter,
I was more thinking in terms of the 

1727
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:48,831
Marine One helicopter was,
well it was a contract that went from $4

1728
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,363
billion to $16 billion without a single 
helicopter being delivered because you 

1729
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:57,210
had a,
you had,

1730
01:21:57,211 --> 01:21:58,044
um,
the military a hierarchy on a committee 

1731
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:02,184
that determined that a,
they wanted this helicopter to be steel 

1732
01:22:05,251 --> 01:22:08,820
instead of aluminum.
And this was a boost of Westland.

1733
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:09,654
And in a nutshell,
they come up with a completely 

1734
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:13,980
redesigned helicopter as opposed to the 
original bid,

1735
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:15,420
which was off the shelf.

1736
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:17,400
Uh,
that would have been 4 billion.

1737
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:19,540
Now it's 16 billion and they haven't,
uh,

1738
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,330
they haven't flown a helicopter.
Well,

1739
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,490
if you had a waste fraud and abuse,
um,

1740
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,760
open door after four,
um,

1741
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,713
I'd,
if I'd have known about it and I 

1742
01:22:28,441 --> 01:22:29,850
would've stepped right in the middle of 
it.

1743
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:30,684
But is that waste fraud or abuse or is 
it just innovation and the expenses 

1744
01:22:33,691 --> 01:22:37,310
involved and changing a design.
But the Pid,

1745
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,420
the bid originally was for off the shelf
helicopters that they were building,

1746
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:43,853
uh,
and that there was going to be bolt on 

1747
01:22:45,061 --> 01:22:45,894
avionics.
And the first thing that this military 

1748
01:22:48,391 --> 01:22:52,230
procurement committee said was,
we don't want an aluminum frame.

1749
01:22:52,231 --> 01:22:55,950
We want to steel frame,
well steel frame that meant that,

1750
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:57,110
um,
that uh,

1751
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:00,900
everything had to be redesigned,
the engines had to be bigger.

1752
01:23:00,901 --> 01:23:02,580
The fuel,
the right,

1753
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,000
so is that waste.
You would go into waste.

1754
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:06,280
It wouldn't be fraud or abuse

1755
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:09,630
necessarily waste total to work.
You know what,

1756
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,473
where's the logic behind that?
But as an engineering decision based on 

1757
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:17,980
like real knowledge that we have about 
the rigidity of steel versus aluminum or

1758
01:23:17,981 --> 01:23:18,814
what does,
what does the,

1759
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,880
she would think that a Gustaf Westland,

1760
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:24,060
a helicopter manufacturing,
um,

1761
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:29,040
business with an off the shelf Heloc,
a helicopter that exists,

1762
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,173
that existed.
That's what the government want this 

1763
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,140
and,
and it transformed into a completely new

1764
01:23:37,141 --> 01:23:38,760
helicopter that has yet to fly.

1765
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,190
That sounds insane.
It's insane.

1766
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,660
It is insane.
It's insane.

1767
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:45,520
Is that there was originally agreed upon
without,

1768
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,060
I mean if they had like an order and the
initial order,

1769
01:23:49,061 --> 01:23:49,894
they had an initial order,
what was the reasoning for making the 

1770
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:55,270
steel frame?
What was the reasoning for changing?

1771
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:56,500
Did it that,
uh,

1772
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,790
that the,
uh,

1773
01:23:57,791 --> 01:23:58,624
that the order then had to go to this 
pure cureman committee for any tweaks 

1774
01:24:02,321 --> 01:24:05,530
and you'd have to think that there are 
tweaks,

1775
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:07,173
but this wasn't a tweak as an enzyme 
tweak that's redesigning an incredibly 

1776
01:24:10,241 --> 01:24:11,074
new,

1777
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,920
it's about as nutty as it gets.
Flint water,

1778
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:16,510
uh,
you know,

1779
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:18,280
the,
the flint water crisis.

1780
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:19,114
Why didn't I tell you what that just 
sounds about as a troche's as it gets 

1781
01:24:22,601 --> 01:24:25,150
when it comes to government turning its 
back on,

1782
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:27,460
on an obvious situation.
I think about,

1783
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:28,323
um,
so I'm reading about it and as governor 

1784
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:31,474
of New Mexico,
I guarantee you that residents from 

1785
01:24:33,821 --> 01:24:37,840
flint would have been at my open door 
after four saying,

1786
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:38,674
look,
I got dirty water and I would have got 

1787
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:43,480
into the middle of,
I'd like to think Joe,

1788
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:46,330
that I would've gotten into the middle 
of it immediately.

1789
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:49,270
But you know what,
if I didn't get into it immediately,

1790
01:24:49,271 --> 01:24:52,420
I'm guessing my second door open door 
after four,

1791
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:54,730
instead of having four people show up 
from flint,

1792
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:55,564
would have 80 people showing up from 
flint point is it would not have gone 

1793
01:24:59,771 --> 01:25:01,690
unnoticed by me as governor.

1794
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:02,523
And I had gotten right into the middle 
of it and I had a mechanism for doing 

1795
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:06,124
it.
And there needs to be a mechanism for 

1796
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:09,700
the president of United States to stay 
in touch.

1797
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:14,500
The imperial presidency of the,
the notion that the president,

1798
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,150
whenever the president travels,
it's,

1799
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:20,710
it's tens of millions of dollars every 
time he travels.

1800
01:25:20,711 --> 01:25:22,030
Well,
that's,

1801
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:26,440
if I'm elected president United States,
that's going to change dramatically.

1802
01:25:26,441 --> 01:25:29,800
Does Air Force One really need to fly a 
everywhere?

1803
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,480
Gosh,
you wouldn't think so.

1804
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:35,290
Why can't the prison,
the United States come into Los Angeles,

1805
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:35,981
uh,
in a,

1806
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:40,981
in a very stealth way and uh,
and travel without having to block a all

1807
01:25:41,321 --> 01:25:42,154
of traffic in Los Angeles,
which you have to f experience many 

1808
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:46,160
times.

1809
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,630
Yeah,
that's pretty gross.

1810
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,673
Well also,
why do they have to fly in Air Force 

1811
01:25:50,721 --> 01:25:52,220
One?
How come they can't just get an American

1812
01:25:52,221 --> 01:25:52,930
airlines all

1813
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:56,200
come well or how bout,
how bout one of those?

1814
01:25:56,201 --> 01:25:57,034
Uh,
how about one of those corporate 

1815
01:25:57,701 --> 01:25:58,900
aircraft that,
uh,

1816
01:25:58,901 --> 01:25:59,734
are in the military that would cost a 
10th of what the Air Force One causes 

1817
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,100
the benefits

1818
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,933
of Air Force One is air force one of 
some sort of a pod where the president 

1819
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:08,290
can parachute to,
saves you.

1820
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:10,040
They tried to shoot it down or something
crazy like that.

1821
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,990
You wonder about that one.
But,

1822
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:12,920
uh,
what about a,

1823
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,680
what about an ejection seat?
I mean,

1824
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:18,410
James Bond's goes on and on and on.
I mean,

1825
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:21,320
yeah,
I can handle the objection.

1826
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,730
You get handled being rejected.
I could handle being ejected.

1827
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,790
I'm uncertain about it.
I mean,

1828
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:30,920
we could go on and on about things.
One of those lines,

1829
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,780
it seems a little,
a little silly,

1830
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:33,883
but it's a little silly.
The whole thing has become not just a 

1831
01:26:36,351 --> 01:26:38,840
little silly.
It's become pretty crazy.

1832
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:39,763
Well.
Also when you isolate the president and 

1833
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:41,414
you make them this person,
they have to shut down all the city 

1834
01:26:43,371 --> 01:26:44,204
streets and bring in a gigantic parade 
of storm troopers that have to stand by 

1835
01:26:49,611 --> 01:26:52,850
his side and you know what it would be?

1836
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:53,773
It'd be great to,
as President United States to just 

1837
01:26:55,821 --> 01:26:56,654
shuttle around in an f 16 I'm going to 
let him shoot me down and an f 16 I'll 

1838
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:02,810
just take the back seat and I'm speaking
now as well.

1839
01:27:02,811 --> 01:27:05,420
They don't go very far,
you know that they don't go very far,

1840
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:08,540
but they go really fast and when we're 
talking about,

1841
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:13,310
we're talking about money and dollars as
opposed to have 16 Ra.

1842
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:17,550
Actually it sounds like you just want to
be in enough 16 no,

1843
01:27:17,551 --> 01:27:18,410
no.
I just want to,

1844
01:27:18,411 --> 01:27:19,244
I just want to spend less money.
I want to be a frugal cat in the White 

1845
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:22,783
House.
What kind of odds do you think there 

1846
01:27:26,391 --> 01:27:27,320
are?
I mean this,

1847
01:27:27,321 --> 01:27:30,170
this election is a very tricky 
obviously,

1848
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:35,230
but what kind of odds do you believe 
there are for 2020 I think,

1849
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,243
first of all,
I would not be doing this if there 

1850
01:27:39,081 --> 01:27:39,914
weren't the opportunity to win,
but the only opportunity that there is 

1851
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:45,620
of winning is to be in the presidential 
debates.

1852
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,060
That's the only chance.
Now,

1853
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:49,460
what's the keys into the presidential 
debates?

1854
01:27:49,461 --> 01:27:51,940
Kind of where we started off.
I used to be in the pole.

1855
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:53,343
Doesn't that seem insane?
That what you have to get in this one 

1856
01:27:56,001 --> 01:27:56,834
thing,
this presidential debates is thing that 

1857
01:27:58,191 --> 01:28:01,760
is [inaudible].
It is the reality.

1858
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:02,440
Yeah.
No,

1859
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,590
no,
maybe not.

1860
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:07,550
I mean maybe that's not the insane part.
Does it?

1861
01:28:07,551 --> 01:28:08,384
Does it not seem logical that anyone who
can mathematically be elected president 

1862
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:18,971
in 2012 that would have included the 
Libertarian Party and the Green Party?

1863
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:20,653
Does it not seem logical that anyone 
capable of being mathematically elected 

1864
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:26,924
president in United States,
270 electoral votes should at a minimum 

1865
01:28:30,621 --> 01:28:34,370
be included in the polls,
that there'd be a requirement that,

1866
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:35,383
and you know that I'm in a 2016 there 
are like 1600 people that registered to 

1867
01:28:42,021 --> 01:28:45,110
run for president.
Wasn't Roseanne Barr one of them.

1868
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:46,071
Uh,
that was,

1869
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:46,904
that was 2012.
That was 2012 but anybody can run for 

1870
01:28:51,231 --> 01:28:52,064
president.
You got to do is sign up with the 

1871
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,640
Federal Elections Commission and you can
run for president.

1872
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:59,330
But at the end of the day,
in 2012 there were only four people that

1873
01:28:59,331 --> 01:29:02,070
could have mathematically been elected.
Doesn't that

1874
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,903
seem fair?

1875
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:04,350
Well,
it doesn't seem well,

1876
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:09,600
the two party system is the biggest 
hurdle right now for it.

1877
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:10,703
I think most people,
when you think about the potential of 

1878
01:29:12,901 --> 01:29:13,734
running for president,
the biggest hurdle is that you have to 

1879
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:19,080
be accepted and you have to be the 
nominee of one of these two parties,

1880
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,110
right?

1881
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:23,020
Oh.
Or that you'll be included in the polls.

1882
01:29:23,021 --> 01:29:28,021
And right now because of just how 
polarizing hillary and a trump are,

1883
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:32,890
that just being in the polls,
that that will register enough,

1884
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:37,780
a dissatisfaction with any third party 
name in this case me.

1885
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,101
Um,
that,

1886
01:29:39,101 --> 01:29:40,860
um,
I'd,

1887
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:44,020
I'd like to think that all the things 
that we've talked about right now,

1888
01:29:44,021 --> 01:29:44,854
you,
you were,

1889
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:48,220
you wouldn't hear out of the mouths of 
either hillary or

1890
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,620
trump.
I don't believe you would.

1891
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:51,720
I don't believe you would even hear it 
from the mouth of Obama.

1892
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:54,390
I think everybody would be much more 
measured.

1893
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:57,420
What I've said about Obama from the very
beginning,

1894
01:29:57,421 --> 01:29:58,254
and I'll still say it today,
is there anything that he says that you 

1895
01:30:00,631 --> 01:30:01,464
can really disagree with?
I've always said that everything that 

1896
01:30:03,271 --> 01:30:07,410
comes out of his mouth is like music.
It's just the reality hasn't matched up

1897
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,410
with the words so,
well,

1898
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,173
the real problem is a lot of the stuff 
that he said running versus what he's 

1899
01:30:15,511 --> 01:30:16,990
done in office,
right?

1900
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:17,843
The hope and change website that talks 
about whistle blowers and then you look 

1901
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:21,504
at his actual actions towards whistle 
blowers and actual actions towards the 

1902
01:30:24,571 --> 01:30:25,590
press.
It's,

1903
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,890
it's pretty disturbing that,
well,

1904
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,680
back to my open door after four or for 
whistle blowers,

1905
01:30:31,681 --> 01:30:32,850
look,
come on in and talk to me.

1906
01:30:32,851 --> 01:30:34,690
Tell me,
tell me about what's going on.

1907
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,150
Well,
that was what I wanted to get to next.

1908
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,090
Maybe I can jump into the middle of it.
That's what I wanted to get to next.

1909
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:42,740
So you're president,
how do you handle Julian assange?

1910
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:48,110
How do you handle Edward Snowden?
What do you do about these two very high

1911
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:49,494
profile situations where most people 
believe that the information that they 

1912
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:55,710
released was very important to the 
American public.

1913
01:30:55,711 --> 01:30:59,340
Very important to understanding what the
government is actually doing.

1914
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:00,730
So,
um,

1915
01:31:00,731 --> 01:31:01,564
I'm,
I'm,

1916
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:04,750
I believe in dreams.
Well,

1917
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:08,860
Julian asage is not been charged.
I don't think by the US government.

1918
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:11,530
We know what's really going on though.
Well,

1919
01:31:11,531 --> 01:31:12,760
we know what's really going on.
I mean,

1920
01:31:12,761 --> 01:31:14,780
Julia was on Snowden.
Yes.

1921
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:16,090
You Pardon?
Snowden.

1922
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:16,963
I,
you know that he has brought to the 

1923
01:31:18,791 --> 01:31:21,450
forefront this,
uh,

1924
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,200
you know,
this mass surveillance,

1925
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:26,160
but just but to play Sozo Joe,
so,

1926
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:27,363
okay,
go ahead.

1927
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:32,370
Yeah.
The entire NSA is an executive order 12,

1928
01:31:33,191 --> 01:31:33,821
three,
three,

1929
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:36,320
three under truman.
Uh,

1930
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:41,010
you could repeal that executive order to
simply turn the satellites.

1931
01:31:41,011 --> 01:31:46,011
So wave from you and I this if they,
if you do 10 million,

1932
01:31:47,411 --> 01:31:51,090
verizon uses this metadata collection,
you can,

1933
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,620
you can,
it's my understanding that you,

1934
01:31:53,621 --> 01:31:57,280
by executive order,
you could actually turn the satellites,

1935
01:31:57,310 --> 01:32:00,460
uh,
on the bad guys as to US citizens.

1936
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,800
But don't you think that if someone 
actually did that,

1937
01:32:02,801 --> 01:32:05,320
they'd probably put you in a convertible
and roll you through Dallas.

1938
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,033
Uh,
that's also a possibility to say you're 

1939
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:15,160
going to get rid of the NSA or diminish 
the NSA or the CIA or the FBI.

1940
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:17,210
You,
you would be in a bad place.

1941
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:19,880
It's,
it's kind of work with them,

1942
01:32:19,881 --> 01:32:21,620
right?
Isn't that the best way to handle it and

1943
01:32:21,621 --> 01:32:23,030
still keep your head?
Or how bout,

1944
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:25,820
how bout the notion of really just doing
the right thing?

1945
01:32:25,821 --> 01:32:30,400
And so the Edward Snowden situation,
did you see the snowden movie that,

1946
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:31,760
uh,
what was it called,

1947
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:37,190
citizen for citizen for everybody 
listening got a c it,

1948
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,820
Edward Snowden.
I mean,

1949
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:41,120
he laid it all out there.
It wasn't about him,

1950
01:32:41,121 --> 01:32:41,954
it was about the information.
He gave all the information to media 

1951
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:47,203
saying,
I do not in any way have the resources 

1952
01:32:49,911 --> 01:32:52,760
to release this data because if I 
release this data,

1953
01:32:52,761 --> 01:32:55,520
maybe I'm going to put people in harm's 
way.

1954
01:32:55,521 --> 01:32:58,100
I don't want to put people's in people 
in harm's way.

1955
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:59,293
So I'm giving this up to a,
I can't remember the institutions that 

1956
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:05,200
he gave it up too,
but he said,

1957
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:08,890
I,
I'm sure they have the resources that,

1958
01:33:08,891 --> 01:33:09,724
uh,
they will be able to disseminate this 

1959
01:33:12,051 --> 01:33:13,700
information.
And um,

1960
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:16,910
and not pete put p uh,
it was just an excellent,

1961
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:22,030
excellent documentary on what I will say
is a real American Patriot

1962
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:24,980
was a docu drama writers dramatization.
No,

1963
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:25,940
it was,
it was,

1964
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:27,020
which one was the drama?
Doesn't it?

1965
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:28,880
One wasn't there one that was a 
dramatization.

1966
01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:30,520
It coming out soon.
That's a dramatization.

1967
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:31,401
Okay.
Okay.

1968
01:33:31,401 --> 01:33:33,830
So citizen four was the actual 
documentary.

1969
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:35,950
It was the actual documentary.
Where were,

1970
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:36,793
when they showed up,
it was Edward Snowden and they showed 

1971
01:33:38,841 --> 01:33:40,850
up.
They didn't know who Edward Snowden was.

1972
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,950
They didn't,
it was amazing.

1973
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,170
You've got,
you've got to see it.

1974
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:45,900
You've got to see.
I'll definitely say it.

1975
01:33:45,901 --> 01:33:46,734
Yeah.
Um,

1976
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:50,690
to play devil's advocate,
if you do pardon Snowden,

1977
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:54,140
that means that if there was a crime 
being committed at all,

1978
01:33:54,141 --> 01:33:56,300
that crime is being committed by the 
NSA.

1979
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,610
If you,
if you demonize snowden,

1980
01:33:58,670 --> 01:33:59,503
as soon as they arrest Doden or they try
to rest snowden and they say the 

1981
01:34:01,941 --> 01:34:04,010
snowdens a bad guy,
what he's done is terrible.

1982
01:34:04,011 --> 01:34:06,170
If it comes the United States,
we're absolutely going to arrest him.

1983
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:08,910
What you're saying is,
and they're putting the,

1984
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,870
the focus on him as a potential 
criminal.

1985
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:12,800
Well,
if,

1986
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,900
if somehow or another he is exonerated 
and he's really,

1987
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,150
well,
what happened then?

1988
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:18,260
Well,
is there a crime?

1989
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:19,220
Well,
if he's exonerated,

1990
01:34:19,221 --> 01:34:20,054
if he's done something that violates the
whatever agreement that he had to sign 

1991
01:34:24,501 --> 01:34:25,334
in order to work for the NSA,
that means that the crime that he 

1992
01:34:29,061 --> 01:34:29,894
exposed was so significant that it was 
valid for him to violate whatever 

1993
01:34:35,451 --> 01:34:37,520
agreement he signed with the federal 
government.

1994
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:38,533
That right now they're pursuing him as a
criminal for which means someone needs 

1995
01:34:41,691 --> 01:34:44,960
to go to jail for the crime if they're,
if they're not going to put him in jail

1996
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,770
and prosecute him.
Interesting way of looking at it.

1997
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:53,390
I look at it from the standpoint of this
is a mistake that we've made.

1998
01:34:53,391 --> 01:34:55,560
Let's acknowledge the mistake and let's,
uh,

1999
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,980
let's move forward.
Let's correct as so I'm

2000
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,410
not knocking that simple,
right?

2001
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:00,500
We had,
may not be,

2002
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:01,334
but,
um,

2003
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:03,580
I'm not looking at this from,
uh,

2004
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:08,570
from the standpoint of prosecuting 
people as much as we've made a mistake.

2005
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,530
Let's correct it is this is what this 
country is really about.

2006
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:17,590
They're still moving forward with this 
data collection thing in Utah unabated.

2007
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:20,390
And when you have testimony before 
Congress,

2008
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:22,730
it says,
are you spying on the American people?

2009
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:24,890
And the response is,
uh,

2010
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:26,930
well,
let's see.

2011
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:28,073
Are,
is their mass surveillance of the 

2012
01:35:29,811 --> 01:35:31,850
American public going on?
And when they said,

2013
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:32,684
no,
the question should have been total 

2014
01:35:36,111 --> 01:35:38,450
surveillance as mass surveillance.
What does that mean?

2015
01:35:38,451 --> 01:35:39,920
Thousands of people?
Well,

2016
01:35:39,921 --> 01:35:41,390
no,
we're talking about a hundred.

2017
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:45,530
So he says no,
the answer being hundreds of millions of

2018
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:49,280
total surveillance,
master males surveillance as far as mass

2019
01:35:49,281 --> 01:35:51,200
surveillance.
So it's correct.

2020
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:53,980
It's actually honest.
If they know we're,

2021
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,300
we're pursing,
we're parsing things here,

2022
01:35:56,301 --> 01:35:57,110
but come on,
we're,

2023
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:58,250
we've been misled.

2024
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,320
This is,
this is not the country that uh,

2025
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,233
we fought wars to preserve.
Does this go back to what we're talking 

2026
01:36:04,401 --> 01:36:05,234
about before?
Were businesses tend to lean towards 

2027
01:36:07,821 --> 01:36:08,654
growth?
So the NSA is involved in growth and 

2028
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,330
they don't want to stop?
I think so.

2029
01:36:14,331 --> 01:36:16,090
It's the Peter Principle.
It's a,

2030
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:16,993
I'm,
I want to justify my life and button to 

2031
01:36:19,461 --> 01:36:20,630
justify my,
and these are,

2032
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:23,630
I'm talking about bureaucrats,
nows justify my life.

2033
01:36:23,631 --> 01:36:24,464
I need to grow what it is I'm doing.
I need to prove that what I'm doing so 

2034
01:36:26,871 --> 01:36:29,660
important that I need people working for
me.

2035
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:32,420
I need to expand what I'm doing because 
it's so important.

2036
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:36,260
So what would you be able to do if 
anything,

2037
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:39,700
as a president?
So you get into office and with Ensa.

2038
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:40,563
Yes.
It's,

2039
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:42,063
it just came to my,
this just came to my attention like 10 

2040
01:36:44,751 --> 01:36:48,640
days ago,
that the NSA is an executive order under

2041
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:49,483
truman,
that the president of the United States 

2042
01:36:51,141 --> 01:36:52,880
could repeal immediately.

2043
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:54,650
God,
that would be ugly.

2044
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:56,870
Why would it be,
they wouldn't let you do that?

2045
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:59,690
Why wouldn't they say,
well,

2046
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:02,000
nothing is simple.
Nothing is simple.

2047
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:02,834
I do not want to downplay on,
on the complexity of what this might 

2048
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:08,600
entail,
but at the end of the day,

2049
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:09,853
um,
is it possible to turn the satellites 

2050
01:37:11,631 --> 01:37:13,280
away from you?
And I will.

2051
01:37:13,281 --> 01:37:16,850
That would be the thing be that we would
want to get rid of the NSA.

2052
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,790
What would it want to be as maybe 
redirect their efforts?

2053
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:20,840
Wow.
Like,

2054
01:37:20,841 --> 01:37:23,880
as in protecting us again,
having an indigo,

2055
01:37:23,950 --> 01:37:25,180
uh,
having a,

2056
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:27,090
uh,
uh,

2057
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:32,360
an impenetrable national defense is an 
impenetrable national defense.

2058
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:35,361
Does that,
I mean,

2059
01:37:35,361 --> 01:37:36,450
this is,
or William,

2060
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:37,663
this is,
this is 1984 they've got the satellites 

2061
01:37:39,861 --> 01:37:41,420
on to us.
Yeah.

2062
01:37:41,421 --> 01:37:42,254
It is bizarre.
It's bizarre that they've just randomly 

2063
01:37:43,911 --> 01:37:48,650
decided to get the entire country under 
surveillance when there's no evidence to

2064
01:37:48,651 --> 01:37:49,930
point that you know,
you're,

2065
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:52,580
you're stopping anything or eliminating 
anything,

2066
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:56,070
but you are putting people in a 
compromised because

2067
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,903
if people know that the government has 
been paying attention to all of their 

2068
01:37:58,921 --> 01:38:03,921
emails and voicemails and all that jazz,
then people will adjust their behavior.

2069
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:05,243
They'll be a little bit more cautious 
that a little bit more cautious with 

2070
01:38:07,351 --> 01:38:10,980
their criticism and if you are ever in a
situation,

2071
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:12,120
yes,
exactly.

2072
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,393
And if you're ever in a situation where 
you are against the government in any 

2073
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:18,690
way,
they will have so much data on you.

2074
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,393
Like if you,
if you're one of those people that 

2075
01:38:21,511 --> 01:38:23,730
decides to Edward Snowden it from here 
on out,

2076
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:25,530
boy,
good luck with that.

2077
01:38:25,531 --> 01:38:30,080
I mean they will instantly be pulling up
emails and voicemails and,

2078
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:34,080
and you've got a real problem on your 
hands because it's not just met a data,

2079
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:35,660
right.
I mean that's also been proven.

2080
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,400
We don't even know.
We don't know.

2081
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:39,653
Nobody knows.
You remember the guy who initially was 

2082
01:38:42,361 --> 01:38:43,480
the whistle blower?
Many,

2083
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,070
many areas.
There are many of them.

2084
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:48,130
There are many of them that are in 
prison for

2085
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,500
the same,
yeah,

2086
01:38:49,501 --> 01:38:50,334
well there's a gentleman that was one of
the original whistle blowers who was 

2087
01:38:52,771 --> 01:38:53,604
actually one of the coders who was 
working with the NSA when they first 

2088
01:38:57,451 --> 01:39:02,451
started designing this sort of program 
and he resigned and went public with all

2089
01:39:02,531 --> 01:39:05,030
of this and he was,
um,

2090
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:06,293
when he was vilified and when Edward 
Snowden came out with all of this 

2091
01:39:11,161 --> 01:39:11,994
information,
this guy started doing interviews again 

2092
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,270
and he started saying like,
listen,

2093
01:39:15,271 --> 01:39:16,104
this is,
I was talking about this in the early 

2094
01:39:17,371 --> 01:39:18,204
two thousands I,
this is something they'd been putting 

2095
01:39:19,741 --> 01:39:22,620
into play for a long time during the 
Bush administration.

2096
01:39:22,621 --> 01:39:23,880
They started us all off

2097
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,110
the NSA.
The,

2098
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:28,411
yeah.
Yeah.

2099
01:39:28,411 --> 01:39:30,030
I think it goes back further than that.

2100
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:30,960
Yeah,
I think it does too.

2101
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,730
It's a true,
here's the guy,

2102
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:33,930
Bill,
Bill Binney,

2103
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,830
the original NSA whistleblower unstowed 
in nine 11 and illegal surveillance.

2104
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:40,190
It's a very,
very interesting story.

2105
01:39:40,191 --> 01:39:41,024
There's,
there's several interviews with this 

2106
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:43,890
guy.
This one is from computer weekly,

2107
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:47,130
but there's several interviews with is 
this gentleman,

2108
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:50,010
he was the original blowing what was a 
year of this Jamie?

2109
01:39:50,011 --> 01:39:53,190
Cause I want to say 2007 but I might be 
wrong.

2110
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,780
It doesn't say,
um,

2111
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:00,090
what does it matter?
Bill Binney is the guy and I've seen him

2112
01:40:00,091 --> 01:40:04,620
interviewed several times and he 
realized while this was all going on,

2113
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:07,500
he's like,
you're not looking for criminals.

2114
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:10,110
You're trying to spy on everyone.
You can't do this.

2115
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:13,440
And I think we all agree that you 
shouldn't be able to do that.

2116
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:15,060
But right now that's happening.

2117
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,370
And,
and very simply,

2118
01:40:17,371 --> 01:40:18,204
there is a process.
The fourth amendment there is due 

2119
01:40:20,011 --> 01:40:20,844
process.
So if there's a bad guy out there that 

2120
01:40:22,681 --> 01:40:23,550
the,
uh,

2121
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,830
the federal government wants to spy on,
you get a warrant,

2122
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:27,510
got to get a warrant.
It's how it should be.

2123
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:28,570
But this,
uh,

2124
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:32,490
Pfizer court where the government goes 
before the Pfizer court and says,

2125
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,600
we want authority to,
uh,

2126
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:39,210
to collect metadata on 110 million 
verizon users.

2127
01:40:39,211 --> 01:40:42,520
I fail to see where that's due process 
in any way shape

2128
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:45,340
I have no one has made an argument 
against that.

2129
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:46,203
No one,
no one has made an argument that makes 

2130
01:40:46,781 --> 01:40:50,080
any sense whatsoever supporting that.
So if that's the case,

2131
01:40:50,081 --> 01:40:53,080
why is it president allow it?
Good question.

2132
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:54,363
Good.
If he's the guy that has all this music 

2133
01:40:55,661 --> 01:40:58,480
coming out of his mouth,
what are his words that are so beautiful

2134
01:40:58,481 --> 01:41:00,940
and melodic about this?
A lot of water.

2135
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:02,530
What's the word?
Well

2136
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:04,150
that's the,
that's the big go.

2137
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:06,360
Obama disappointment is,
um,

2138
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:10,040
I'm sure if we went into the archives he
would have been addressed.

2139
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:11,093
Well maybe he wouldn't have,
cause he wouldn't have even known about 

2140
01:41:12,601 --> 01:41:14,320
this metadata collection.
But

2141
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,370
I do.
Well,

2142
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:16,204
he was the,
in the hope and change website when he 

2143
01:41:17,891 --> 01:41:18,724
was running for president,
one of the things he was talking about 

2144
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:24,730
was supporting whistleblowers that are 
revealing criminal activity.

2145
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:27,610
Well,
he's directly contradicted that.

2146
01:41:27,611 --> 01:41:28,444
I mean,
he's everything he's done in regards to 

2147
01:41:30,281 --> 01:41:33,460
people blowing whistles and revealing 
government problems.

2148
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:35,140
He's,
he's prosecuted them.

2149
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:38,170
They'd been worse on freedom of the 
press than any other president.

2150
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:43,320
We will look at Bush as being like this 
really terrible like a draconian guy,

2151
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:44,583
but the Bush administration was easier 
on whistle blowers and easier on press 

2152
01:41:48,251 --> 01:41:50,170
and trying to get pressed to reveal 
their sources.

2153
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:55,171
Then the Obama administration back to 
back to the reality.

2154
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:57,070
Not matching up at all.
Exactly.

2155
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:58,120
Yeah.
The reality,

2156
01:41:58,121 --> 01:42:02,110
not matching up at all,
not just with the words but with the,

2157
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:05,020
the appearance,
like it's the appearance of this,

2158
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:10,410
this really educated like socially aware
guy who gets into play black.

2159
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:14,950
Finally,
we've got this articulate,

2160
01:42:14,951 --> 01:42:16,930
intelligent,
well read president.

2161
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:19,770
This is a relief from the guy who,
you know,

2162
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:22,540
stumbles through words and says a bunch 
of stupid shit.

2163
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,850
Like this is our guy.
This is our guy.

2164
01:42:24,851 --> 01:42:27,640
Finally.
But then same practices,

2165
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:28,630
in fact,
worse,

2166
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:30,220
worse,
more drone attacks,

2167
01:42:30,221 --> 01:42:31,060
more.
I mean,

2168
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:32,253
what do you do about that?
What do you do about a program that the 

2169
01:42:34,301 --> 01:42:37,830
drone attacks have resulted in?
I believe the numbers,

2170
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:38,673
like more than 80% accidental death or 
more than 80% civilians being killed 

2171
01:42:45,731 --> 01:42:47,620
versus the intended target.

2172
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:48,733
Well,
this is the unintended consequence of 

2173
01:42:50,841 --> 01:42:53,930
our military interventions,
that they're making things worse,

2174
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:54,793
not better.
And I am talking about boots on the 

2175
01:42:56,871 --> 01:42:59,270
ground.
I'm talking about dropping bombs and the

2176
01:42:59,271 --> 01:43:03,110
fact that drones do fly and kill 
thousands of innocent people.

2177
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:07,350
And when I had Mike Baker on,
who was a former CIA operative,

2178
01:43:07,351 --> 01:43:09,090
when he,
when he and I were discussing this,

2179
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,290
he,
he was saying that,

2180
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:12,690
look,
what you're seeing is lawyers make those

2181
01:43:12,691 --> 01:43:13,524
decisions,
these decisions of whether to bomb or 

2182
01:43:15,481 --> 01:43:17,430
not to bomb.
They're being done by lawyers.

2183
01:43:17,610 --> 01:43:20,370
They sit down,
they let go over the possibilities,

2184
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:24,420
they go over the risks versus reward,
and they make the call.

2185
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:30,400
What the fuck kind of world is that?
That's the world that I'm with.

2186
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:33,060
That's the world that can be changed,
I think.

2187
01:43:33,061 --> 01:43:34,950
So here's the big battle ship.
It's the United States.

2188
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:38,010
Well,
yeah,

2189
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:39,450
super tank or whatever you would call 
it.

2190
01:43:39,990 --> 01:43:42,600
Well first you got your cruiser first.
You know,

2191
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:43,443
it's,
what is it?

2192
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:44,723
What is it at six months it takes six 
miles to turn the six super tanker 

2193
01:43:47,431 --> 01:43:49,320
around.
Turn it around 180 degrees.

2194
01:43:49,321 --> 01:43:52,040
Well first you got to stop the engines 
first.

2195
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,200
First you got to actually start the 
process.

2196
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:54,561
Yeah.
And,

2197
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:55,394
okay,
so it's six miles before you can 

2198
01:43:56,331 --> 01:43:58,100
actually pull the uturn.
Well,

2199
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,080
we're,
we're full steam ahead.

2200
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,310
We're still full steam ahead.

2201
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,750
Okay.
So let's talk military.

2202
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:04,250
So you're,
you're in office,

2203
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:07,910
obviously you need to protect people.
Obviously there's threats out there,

2204
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:09,133
both a broad and locally.
What do you do in terms of minimizing 

2205
01:44:14,811 --> 01:44:16,520
the amount of money that we spend on the
military?

2206
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:17,563
Minimizing the amount of invasion of 
privacy that the branches of the 

2207
01:44:21,201 --> 01:44:22,850
military,
like things like the NSA,

2208
01:44:22,851 --> 01:44:26,510
which I guess you consider the military,
some sort of security apparatus for us.

2209
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:28,450
Right.
What would you consider the NSA?

2210
01:44:28,451 --> 01:44:31,220
Is that military?
What would you consider it?

2211
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,270
I don't know.
National Security Administration,

2212
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:35,300
but I mean,
obviously it's,

2213
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,910
some has to do with the military,
right?

2214
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:41,810
Has To be oversight or has to,
has to be,

2215
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:43,123
has to be some transparency.
So when you're talking about the 

2216
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:46,244
military,
how do you go about minimizing the 

2217
01:44:48,411 --> 01:44:51,890
impact or minimizing the negative 
aspects of it?

2218
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:53,300
Well,
um,

2219
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:55,700
make no bones.
If we're attacked,

2220
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:56,563
we're going to attack back,
that we should have an impenetrable 

2221
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:00,950
national defense,

2222
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:05,480
but we're anything but defense.
Whereas Congress in all of this,

2223
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:06,343
uh,
they've abdicated their responsibility 

2224
01:45:08,571 --> 01:45:13,571
to declare war for the American people 
to have a discussion and debate over how

2225
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:19,790
the military should proceed.
They've abdicated that responsibility to

2226
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:21,980
the president of the United States who's
doing this,

2227
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:23,030
uh,
on executive.

2228
01:45:23,031 --> 01:45:23,110
Yeah.

2229
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:27,180
Border along with the military.
That's where I rack got really weird,

2230
01:45:27,181 --> 01:45:29,970
right?
Where it wasn't an actual act of war.

2231
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:30,790
Wasn't that right?
That

2232
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:32,550
congress had allowed,
had,

2233
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:33,633
well,
the Congress has allowed the president 

2234
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,290
to carry on this,
um,

2235
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:41,290
uh,
to do what the president sees fit.

2236
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:42,190
Well,
that,

2237
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:44,080
that is,
that's my opinion.

2238
01:45:44,081 --> 01:45:44,914
That's an abdication of,
of constitutional responsibility by 

2239
01:45:48,221 --> 01:45:50,500
Congress.
So let's reestablish that.

2240
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:53,860
I think the biggest threat in the world 
right now is,

2241
01:45:53,861 --> 01:45:57,160
um,
is North Korea and the fact that at some

2242
01:45:57,161 --> 01:45:58,210
point,
uh,

2243
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,280
Kim,
uh,

2244
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:04,290
is at some point these intercontinental 
ballistic missiles are going to work.

2245
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:09,220
And this guy isn't not so hot about the 
notion of,

2246
01:46:09,221 --> 01:46:10,054
um,
really getting together with China 

2247
01:46:11,711 --> 01:46:14,410
because this is in China's best interest
to,

2248
01:46:14,411 --> 01:46:17,650
uh,
to get rid of Kim unify the Koreas,

2249
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:21,040
um,
get American troops out of South Korea.

2250
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:25,060
Um,
if Cuba,

2251
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:26,260
look,
we didn't,

2252
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:28,540
we didn't put up for a second that,
uh,

2253
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:32,560
that Russia was going to occupy or have 
missiles in,

2254
01:46:32,561 --> 01:46:33,790
uh,
uh,

2255
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:34,720
in Cuba.

2256
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:39,670
Do you think China likes the fact that 
we got 40,000 troops in Korea?

2257
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:40,361
Uh,
no.

2258
01:46:40,361 --> 01:46:41,920
They don't like it a bit.
Well,

2259
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:46,420
do we not make the world a lot more 
secure if we can't come to terms with,

2260
01:46:46,450 --> 01:46:49,030
uh,
with China on how we can,

2261
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:50,183
with what I will argue the biggest 
threat in the world right now in China 

2262
01:46:53,011 --> 01:46:54,870
is an ally of North Korea,
correct?

2263
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:59,010
They are,
but they're an embarrassment to from all

2264
01:46:59,011 --> 01:47:00,950
that I can glean.
They're an embarrassment.

2265
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:05,960
A 70% of South Korea's trade export goes
to China.

2266
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:08,093
None of North Korea's export goes to 
China because there is no product to 

2267
01:47:12,931 --> 01:47:14,200
export.
Um,

2268
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:15,660
it's,
it's,

2269
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:19,230
well,
but it's turned that ship around.

2270
01:47:19,231 --> 01:47:20,064
Boy,
you want to talk about turning a tough 

2271
01:47:21,121 --> 01:47:24,280
ship around the North Korea ship when 
you're talking about an entire brainwash

2272
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:26,400
country.
It's a very sad,

2273
01:47:26,401 --> 01:47:29,340
sad state.
China is not blind to that.

2274
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:31,530
Let's take advantage of,
um,

2275
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,300
let's take advantage of,
uh,

2276
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:38,420
of establishing a partnership and 
alliance with China to deal with that,

2277
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:41,370
but there are already so poor and so 
screwed over.

2278
01:47:41,371 --> 01:47:46,371
What do you do as opposed metairie 
intervention as opposed to us as opposed

2279
01:47:47,341 --> 01:47:48,174
to us dealing with it.
It's in China's best interest to deal 

2280
01:47:51,481 --> 01:47:54,660
with this and so that China has,
what are,

2281
01:47:54,661 --> 01:47:58,770
they have this island that they build 40
miles off their coast or whatever it is.

2282
01:47:58,771 --> 01:48:00,180
What's,
what's the big deal?

2283
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:02,990
The United States does this all the 
time.

2284
01:48:03,070 --> 01:48:04,530
What's the big deal?
Big Deal.

2285
01:48:04,531 --> 01:48:05,820
In what way?
Like what do you say?

2286
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:06,673
Well,
this is somehow a threat to US security 

2287
01:48:08,701 --> 01:48:09,630
that a,
you know,

2288
01:48:09,631 --> 01:48:13,260
that they've built an island 40 miles 
off of their mainland.

2289
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:15,090
Um,
I don't get it.

2290
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,553
We're spending more on out.
We're spending as much money on our 

2291
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:23,430
military as the all the other nations in
the world combined.

2292
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:24,383
What does that say?
Does that say maybe we're spending more 

2293
01:48:26,761 --> 01:48:27,594
than our fair share talk about?
Well that's also were the number one 

2294
01:48:32,581 --> 01:48:33,414
superpower in the world.
And in order to maintain that position 

2295
01:48:35,731 --> 01:48:38,230
and be the benevolent dictators,
well,

2296
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:39,660
and to what,
to what end,

2297
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:42,570
to what end are we maintaining that 
position?

2298
01:48:42,571 --> 01:48:43,141
What,
what,

2299
01:48:43,141 --> 01:48:47,040
what is the end game here where the end 
game is to provide national,

2300
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:50,040
impenetrable national defense for our 
country?

2301
01:48:50,041 --> 01:48:51,030
I mean,
um,

2302
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:53,460
I don't want to put troops in harm's 
way.

2303
01:48:53,461 --> 01:48:54,294
I don't,
I don't want,

2304
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:55,493
I don't want men and women dying in 
situations where that does not have to 

2305
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,020
take place.
You know,

2306
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:03,430
that fact they get injured,
they come back here,

2307
01:49:03,431 --> 01:49:06,420
the rest of their lives there.
They're affected by

2308
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,060
stop.
I agree with you.

2309
01:49:11,061 --> 01:49:13,400
But to play devil's advocate and take 
their point of view,

2310
01:49:13,401 --> 01:49:18,260
they would say that what they're doing 
overseas is saving things from happening

2311
01:49:18,261 --> 01:49:23,240
here and keeping people safe by 
intervening in other countries,

2312
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:26,240
by blocking things from taking place.
I mean,

2313
01:49:26,241 --> 01:49:27,074
this would be the argument for a large 
prevalent military that is this all 

2314
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:31,070
right.

2315
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:33,350
The world.
That is always the argument.

2316
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:37,850
But the reality is,
is that these interventions at best make

2317
01:49:37,851 --> 01:49:42,350
things the same or leave things the same
but versus get worse.

2318
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:45,480
That's what their argument would be like
if they weren't doing this,

2319
01:49:45,481 --> 01:49:46,314
that you would have the superpowers 
developed in these other countries and 

2320
01:49:49,031 --> 01:49:51,190
it would become a gigantic issue.
Whether it's Iran,

2321
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:53,500
whether it's Russia,
whether it's whatever it is,

2322
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:55,210
take it rock for an example,

2323
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:58,500
we intervene in Iraq.
Um,

2324
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:02,640
the biggest threat to Iran was Iraq with
Saddam Hussein.

2325
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:06,040
That that's all their concern was,
was how,

2326
01:50:06,041 --> 01:50:08,490
how did they deal with Saddam Hussein in
Iraq?

2327
01:50:08,491 --> 01:50:10,680
We go in and we'd take out Saddam 
Hussein.

2328
01:50:10,710 --> 01:50:11,543
Well,
now all of a sudden we cut the head of 

2329
01:50:12,661 --> 01:50:15,060
that hydro off.
Now all of a sudden we have to deal with

2330
01:50:15,061 --> 01:50:17,130
Iran.
Something that we weren't having to deal

2331
01:50:17,131 --> 01:50:20,490
with before.
That's an unintended consequence.

2332
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:22,680
Do we need to deal with Iran?
I mean,

2333
01:50:22,681 --> 01:50:25,350
what is the reason why we have to deal 
with Iran?

2334
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:28,200
They're the biggest funder of terrorism 
in the world.

2335
01:50:28,230 --> 01:50:29,960
They fund terrorism.
Um,

2336
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:31,830
there's,
it's undeniable.

2337
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:36,180
So at first I was in support of this 
treaty and naively,

2338
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,580
meaning the treaty that we signed with 
Iran that,

2339
01:50:38,581 --> 01:50:41,190
uh,
ended up releasing however much money it

2340
01:50:41,191 --> 01:50:45,600
was,
$160 billion in by secretary Kerry's own

2341
01:50:45,601 --> 01:50:47,420
image admission,
uh,

2342
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:48,900
question was,
will,

2343
01:50:48,901 --> 01:50:52,410
will there not be funds that will get 
directed at terrorism?

2344
01:50:52,411 --> 01:50:53,880
And he said,
yes,

2345
01:50:53,881 --> 01:50:56,550
there will be funds that will be 
directed at terrorism.

2346
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:57,953
So how on earth could we have signed 
that agreement with Iran given the fact 

2347
01:51:03,661 --> 01:51:06,510
that they are the biggest funder of 
terrorism

2348
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:07,533
world?
What is their motivation of fund 

2349
01:51:08,681 --> 01:51:09,514
terrorism?
Is their motivation to fund terrorism 

2350
01:51:10,961 --> 01:51:11,794
because they're concerned with the 
United States continuing to develop 

2351
01:51:14,201 --> 01:51:16,090
power in the Middle East?
Like what is there?

2352
01:51:16,110 --> 01:51:19,000
Well,
it could be a common devil's advocate.

2353
01:51:19,070 --> 01:51:19,471
Yeah.
No,

2354
01:51:19,471 --> 01:51:19,790
no,
no.

2355
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:21,520
It could be a con.
I don't want to

2356
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:25,230
discount anything that's being said by 
anyone,

2357
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:28,620
but from our standpoint,
um,

2358
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:33,800
this is w we're,
we're contributing to what will be,

2359
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:35,033
um,
more terrorism because terrorism will 

2360
01:51:36,841 --> 01:51:39,660
get funded from some of this money that 
got freed up.

2361
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:40,903
Now when you say that,
when you say funding terrorism 

2362
01:51:42,591 --> 01:51:44,120
specifically,
what do you mean?

2363
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:45,673
Well,
where were we at some point the these 

2364
01:51:49,611 --> 01:51:53,210
terrorist groups and I'm not,
and who's to say,

2365
01:51:53,211 --> 01:51:56,510
where are the connection using Brussels 
as an example?

2366
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:57,373
Who's to say where those guys were 
getting their funds from their support 

2367
01:52:01,671 --> 01:52:02,504
from?
Well,

2368
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:03,693
um,
it's not a stretch to say that it may 

2369
01:52:06,981 --> 01:52:08,600
have come from Iran,

2370
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:12,050
but isn't that a big statement that 
should be qualified?

2371
01:52:12,860 --> 01:52:15,620
Well,
regardless of whether it's Brussels or,

2372
01:52:15,621 --> 01:52:16,454
or wherever,
at some point the funding for terrorism 

2373
01:52:20,511 --> 01:52:23,630
has results.
And in this case,

2374
01:52:23,631 --> 01:52:28,631
if you are allowing a contributor to 
terrorism to have funds to contribute as

2375
01:52:30,351 --> 01:52:32,750
the United States,
um,

2376
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:33,713
are,
are we not making the situation worse 

2377
01:52:35,301 --> 01:52:39,440
when we go in and militarily intervene 
and leave equipment,

2378
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:40,850
uh,
Afghanistan,

2379
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,880
we leave equipment,
we ended up arming the Taliban when the,

2380
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,220
when the Russians leave,
the Taliban is equipped to,

2381
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:54,221
they're equipped with a US arms because 
we use the Taliban to fight,

2382
01:52:54,490 --> 01:52:56,150
um,
the Russians.

2383
01:52:56,230 --> 01:52:57,580
Right.
But to bring them back to Iran.

2384
01:52:57,581 --> 01:53:01,920
What if any evidence is available that 
shows that I ran funded terrorism,

2385
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:03,640
uh,
unequivocal.

2386
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,040
Uh,
I,

2387
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:07,900
I can't state for you the ABC's of it,
but,

2388
01:53:07,901 --> 01:53:10,510
um,
unequivocal sec,

2389
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:12,790
secretary of State,
um,

2390
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:14,370
Carrie,
uh,

2391
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:15,670
was asked the question,
well,

2392
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:16,533
isn't some of this money,
some of it going to get directed at 

2393
01:53:20,621 --> 01:53:22,960
funding terrorism?
And his response was,

2394
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:23,853
yeah,
you,

2395
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,753
yes,
some of it unquestionably is going to 

2396
01:53:26,651 --> 01:53:29,530
get directed toward terrorism.
I don't know how we can,

2397
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:35,160
how we could have a okayed that given,
given what has been acknowledged,

2398
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:37,780
what is the benefit of giving them 
money?

2399
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:39,671
You know,
uh,

2400
01:53:39,671 --> 01:53:41,680
I'm,
I'm all for the free trade.

2401
01:53:41,790 --> 01:53:42,623
Um,
I think that free trade at the end of 

2402
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:47,220
the day is a really powerful tool.
Um,

2403
01:53:47,770 --> 01:53:49,540
I don't have the answer to this and I 
don't want to,

2404
01:53:49,541 --> 01:53:50,374
I don't want to misstate anything,
but this is a conversation that we're 

2405
01:53:54,431 --> 01:53:55,264
having a could we have not opened up 
free trade with Iran and still kept 

2406
01:53:59,801 --> 01:54:01,840
their assets frozen.
And by that,

2407
01:54:01,870 --> 01:54:03,940
that uh,
assets that,

2408
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:04,803
that now they enter into the world 
community that they can sell their oil 

2409
01:54:08,230 --> 01:54:10,950
and on an ongoing basis,
um,

2410
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:15,610
um,
w we'll have free trade with Iran.

2411
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,560
They can spend the money as they see 
fit.

2412
01:54:17,561 --> 01:54:20,110
But with regard to the money that's been
frozen,

2413
01:54:20,450 --> 01:54:21,130
um,
if,

2414
01:54:21,130 --> 01:54:21,963
if,
if we believe that any of that's going 

2415
01:54:24,251 --> 01:54:28,180
to be redirected or directed at 
terrorism,

2416
01:54:28,181 --> 01:54:29,590
why did we do that?
I don't,

2417
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,593
I,
I,

2418
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,590
I'm just saying I W I don't get it.

2419
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:33,933
Well,
what has been the response by the 

2420
01:54:34,601 --> 01:54:35,434
administration?
I mean there's this question been 

2421
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:39,760
brought up and what have they,
how have they answered it?

2422
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:41,740
Well,
that was the,

2423
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:43,510
this was,
this was,

2424
01:54:43,511 --> 01:54:44,350
gosh,
maybe,

2425
01:54:44,410 --> 01:54:45,243
I don't know,
six months ago and Carrie was asked 

2426
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:49,570
cause and you know,
it was very matter of factly.

2427
01:54:49,571 --> 01:54:51,850
Yes.
Some of it's going to get redirected to,

2428
01:54:52,210 --> 01:54:54,370
you know,
you have to I think is,

2429
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:55,613
I'm a secondhand or firsthand.
I mean I'm repeating what I thought I 

2430
01:54:58,871 --> 01:55:00,040
heard him say,
which was,

2431
01:55:00,041 --> 01:55:00,874
yeah,
unquestionably,

2432
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:03,040
some of this is going to go to 
terrorism.

2433
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:04,633
I don't get it.

2434
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:06,733
Okay,
well we don't have specifics to discuss 

2435
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:10,520
when it comes to that,
like specific facts.

2436
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:12,800
So it gets,
it gets it.

2437
01:55:12,801 --> 01:55:14,510
And we got,
we got the Internet and going.

2438
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:15,740
Yeah,
we definitely do.

2439
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:18,590
Um,
I wonder what,

2440
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:23,620
if anything can be done to calm some of 
the areas down in the world.

2441
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:25,903
Um,
and how much of what's going on in the 

2442
01:55:28,071 --> 01:55:28,904
world is about controlling resources and
how much of that would change if we had 

2443
01:55:32,691 --> 01:55:35,030
less reliance on fossil fuels?

2444
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:36,613
Well,
we're not getting any of our oil right 

2445
01:55:38,091 --> 01:55:40,190
now from a,
from the Middle East.

2446
01:55:40,191 --> 01:55:43,080
We're not getting the enacting well,
we are fracking and,

2447
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:44,010
and,
and,

2448
01:55:44,011 --> 01:55:46,230
uh,
that statement is not completely true.

2449
01:55:46,231 --> 01:55:49,920
We are getting oil from all over the 
world,

2450
01:55:49,921 --> 01:55:50,754
but,
so our refineries here in the United 

2451
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:55,050
States,
so,

2452
01:55:55,050 --> 01:55:55,883
so there's a,
there's a trade off where we're x 

2453
01:55:57,381 --> 01:55:58,214
sporting really clean oil or oil that 
doesn't need as much refining and we're 

2454
01:56:04,561 --> 01:56:07,650
importing oil that is dirty so it's 
cheaper.

2455
01:56:07,651 --> 01:56:10,860
So there's a more of a profit margin to 
bring in dirty oil,

2456
01:56:10,861 --> 01:56:15,861
refine it,
and make more money by exporting cleaner

2457
01:56:16,831 --> 01:56:21,810
oil that refineries overseas can handle 
as opposed to the United States.

2458
01:56:21,811 --> 01:56:24,330
So there is that going on.
But for the most part,

2459
01:56:24,331 --> 01:56:26,730
we are,
we're energy sufficient,

2460
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:28,440
uh,
at the moment because of fracking.

2461
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,753
But when we entered into Iraq,
one of the more cynical concerns was 

2462
01:56:32,701 --> 01:56:36,570
that we were doing it because we were 
trying to control natural resources.

2463
01:56:36,571 --> 01:56:37,100
We were sure.

2464
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:38,420
Yes.
And at that time,

2465
01:56:38,421 --> 01:56:40,070
I think that that,
I mean,

2466
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:42,380
did that not play a part in the 
equation?

2467
01:56:42,381 --> 01:56:44,870
Certainly the administration denied 
that,

2468
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:45,733
but,
um,

2469
01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:50,510
everybody I think saw that for what it 
was to,

2470
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:52,430
that that was the case.

2471
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:55,750
So when you look at the world in terms 
of threats and,

2472
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,180
Ooh,
imminent danger to the United States,

2473
01:56:58,181 --> 01:57:00,430
like what could be done to try to lessen
that?

2474
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,920
Well,
first and foremost,

2475
01:57:02,921 --> 01:57:06,910
and this is where the Obama 
administration has concentrated on,

2476
01:57:06,911 --> 01:57:11,911
and I couldn't tell you the status of 
how effective it is a,

2477
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:14,560
but it is to cut off funding to 
terrorism.

2478
01:57:14,561 --> 01:57:16,180
I mean that's the,
that's the,

2479
01:57:16,181 --> 01:57:17,080
uh,
that's the goal.

2480
01:57:17,081 --> 01:57:18,760
The,
Eh,

2481
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,560
um,
Saudi Arabia,

2482
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:21,843
terrorism.
Such a weird word because it's such a 

2483
01:57:23,651 --> 01:57:24,484
blanket statement.
If you're not talking about an 

2484
01:57:25,931 --> 01:57:28,480
individual nation with an individual 
motive,

2485
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:30,700
you know,
you say terrorism,

2486
01:57:30,701 --> 01:57:34,630
it's like we have a war on terror.
What does that really mean?

2487
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:35,651
You know,
I mean,

2488
01:57:35,651 --> 01:57:36,580
well they talking about

2489
01:57:37,190 --> 01:57:38,023
in groups and Muslim,
the Muslims get extremely offended when 

2490
01:57:41,151 --> 01:57:44,310
you use the term Islamic terrorism or 
Moose,

2491
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:45,130
uh,
you know,

2492
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:47,210
um,
Islamic terrorism,

2493
01:57:47,211 --> 01:57:48,044
which looking at it from the outside,
it does appear as though there is that 

2494
01:57:52,340 --> 01:57:53,680
constant.
Um,

2495
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:55,130
but,
um,

2496
01:57:55,790 --> 01:57:57,950
Muslims would say that,
look,

2497
01:57:57,951 --> 01:58:01,160
that's not inherent in the Muslim 
religion,

2498
01:58:01,161 --> 01:58:04,640
which I more than agree with.
Um,

2499
01:58:05,150 --> 01:58:05,983
so this is the political correctness 
about saying terrorism as opposed to 

2500
01:58:10,521 --> 01:58:11,990
Islamic terrorists.
Right?

2501
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:13,033
Right.
But the terrorist just happened to be 

2502
01:58:15,861 --> 01:58:19,520
Islamic does seem to be that common 
element,

2503
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:22,500
but is that something that's taught?
Um,

2504
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:25,050
is that something that most,
uh,

2505
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:27,230
most of,
uh,

2506
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:30,920
Muslim religion believes in you?
No.

2507
01:58:30,921 --> 01:58:31,970
No,
no,

2508
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:36,080
but it does seem to be a common thread.
And,

2509
01:58:36,081 --> 01:58:37,490
um,
but that's the political,

2510
01:58:37,550 --> 01:58:39,890
I'm repeating myself here.
I,

2511
01:58:40,730 --> 01:58:41,950
how do calm that down?

2512
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:42,610
I mean,
what do you,

2513
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:43,443
how do you,
is there any way to appease people that 

2514
01:58:46,181 --> 01:58:47,590
are so upset at the United States?
I mean,

2515
01:58:47,591 --> 01:58:48,424
what is their major gripe?
What does her major reason for being 

2516
01:58:50,531 --> 01:58:52,420
upset with us?
And as a president,

2517
01:58:52,450 --> 01:58:54,280
what would you do to try to stop that or

2518
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:55,853
well,
that you would contain it for at a 

2519
01:58:57,271 --> 01:58:58,104
minimum,
you'd try and contain it to where it's 

2520
01:58:59,721 --> 01:59:02,790
at and not allow it to spread.
And now I'm back to,

2521
01:59:02,791 --> 01:59:03,624
uh,
uh,

2522
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:06,750
uh,
military policy defense,

2523
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,633
um,
having an impenetrable national defense 

2524
01:59:09,841 --> 01:59:10,674
that the notion of somehow a dirty bomb 
getting over here into the United 

2525
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,491
States.
I mean,

2526
01:59:14,491 --> 01:59:17,790
that should be a real,
a real live concern.

2527
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:19,363
Just getting military operatives though 
they believe that a proactive attack or 

2528
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:27,500
proactive action is much more likely to 
stop isis or anything nice or,

2529
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:30,750
well,
and that's,

2530
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:33,900
and that's been our tact to date.
And,

2531
01:59:33,901 --> 01:59:35,880
um,
I'm going to say that,

2532
01:59:35,881 --> 01:59:36,714
uh,
without exception that every one of 

2533
01:59:39,751 --> 01:59:44,640
those military interventions have had an
unintended consequence of at best,

2534
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:45,491
you know,
we,

2535
01:59:45,491 --> 01:59:46,250
we,
we,

2536
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:47,071
we go,
we're,

2537
01:59:47,071 --> 01:59:49,350
we're,
we always deal with atrocity,

2538
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:53,340
their atrocities going on.
We go in to deal with that atrocity.

2539
01:59:53,341 --> 01:59:56,460
And at the end of the day,
the new dictator,

2540
01:59:56,461 --> 01:59:59,640
the new desperate that we put into place
to replace the bad,

2541
01:59:59,641 --> 02:00:03,660
desperate at the end of the day is just 
as bad or in many cases worse.

2542
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:07,440
We cut off the head of the Hydra and Lo 
and behold,

2543
02:00:07,441 --> 02:00:08,490
they're more heads.

2544
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,720
So how does one stop that?
I mean it,

2545
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:11,573
I mean,
if you ever tried to come up with some 

2546
02:00:12,511 --> 02:00:13,344
sort of a solution or look at some sort 
of a long term plan that would somehow 

2547
02:00:16,411 --> 02:00:17,244
or another calm the world,
or at least allow the United States to 

2548
02:00:21,301 --> 02:00:22,134
make peace.

2549
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:23,303
You know,
one of the reasons that I'm seeking to 

2550
02:00:24,861 --> 02:00:25,694
become president of United States is I 
think I do a really good job of 

2551
02:00:28,881 --> 02:00:33,881
presiding over over all the intelligence
that we do have regarding all of this.

2552
02:00:35,061 --> 02:00:39,350
And I don't want to,
I don't want to present myself as having

2553
02:00:39,351 --> 02:00:42,470
the answers as much as you know,
what,

2554
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:44,870
give me,
give me the Intel,

2555
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:45,733
uh,
let me be part of this discussion and 

2556
02:00:48,351 --> 02:00:49,184
um,
but I'm going to enter into this 

2557
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,850
discussion as a real skeptic,
um,

2558
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:58,930
on what we've done to this point and a 
real skeptic on what appears to be,

2559
02:00:59,031 --> 02:01:02,060
what we're going to do in the future 
regarding all of this.

2560
02:01:02,061 --> 02:01:04,670
And isn't there a more effective way of 
dealing with this?

2561
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:06,433
I wouldn't be seeking this job if I'm,
if I didn't think that I could make a 

2562
02:01:10,611 --> 02:01:15,220
difference in it and I,
I do not want to misstate.

2563
02:01:15,230 --> 02:01:17,360
I don't want to,
I don't want to play cards.

2564
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:21,800
Obama draws lines in the sand.
I'm not going to draw lines in the sand.

2565
02:01:21,801 --> 02:01:22,634
If you draw any lines in the sand,
you better be prepared to back up what 

2566
02:01:25,281 --> 02:01:26,630
you've said,
uh,

2567
02:01:26,631 --> 02:01:27,464
with action.
And that's also been an issue with 

2568
02:01:29,181 --> 02:01:30,014
Obama.

2569
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:30,993
How much different do you think 
perspective changes once you get into 

2570
02:01:34,301 --> 02:01:35,134
office?
Once you get into office and you sit 

2571
02:01:36,341 --> 02:01:39,040
down with military leaders and you sit 
down with someone,

2572
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:40,160
explains to you

2573
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:40,993
the,
the actual landscape you're dealing 

2574
02:01:41,931 --> 02:01:42,764
with.

2575
02:01:43,230 --> 02:01:44,063
I think he pushed himself too.
I think that perspective can change a 

2576
02:01:47,251 --> 02:01:49,800
lot.
But how about being transparent?

2577
02:01:49,801 --> 02:01:50,634
How about saying how bout,
how bout being transparent with the 

2578
02:01:52,951 --> 02:01:53,784
American public?
How about educating the American public 

2579
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:59,040
to um,
to the Intel that does exist.

2580
02:01:59,120 --> 02:01:59,953
It's a wooden,
they possibly alert the enemy that we 

2581
02:02:01,651 --> 02:02:02,484
have knowledge of.
Some things they may or may not know we 

2582
02:02:04,021 --> 02:02:04,720
have knowledge of

2583
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:05,553
and that you certain danger,
you certainly wouldn't want to cross 

2584
02:02:07,771 --> 02:02:10,770
over that line in any way whatsoever.
But uh,

2585
02:02:10,830 --> 02:02:11,663
if,
if you've got elected to office saying 

2586
02:02:13,501 --> 02:02:14,334
that we should not militarily intervene,
that military interventions have an 

2587
02:02:17,491 --> 02:02:21,780
unintended consequence and then the next
day you militarily intervene somewhere,

2588
02:02:21,781 --> 02:02:25,470
you better darn well get up in front of 
the American public and take the,

2589
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:30,150
take the eggs and tomatoes or,

2590
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:31,273
or worse.
What was your take when Obama went on 

2591
02:02:33,351 --> 02:02:34,184
television and was talking about how we 
needed to invade Syria and Syria was a 

2592
02:02:39,021 --> 02:02:39,854
huge issue.
And then the American public was up in 

2593
02:02:41,091 --> 02:02:42,860
arms,
both the right and the left people like,

2594
02:02:42,861 --> 02:02:45,080
what are you talking about?
This is craziness.

2595
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,333
And then the,
the administration backed off and we 

2596
02:02:48,051 --> 02:02:48,771
was,
to me,

2597
02:02:48,771 --> 02:02:49,604
my opinion,
it was one of the first that was 

2598
02:02:51,411 --> 02:02:52,630
drawing,
I'm sorry.

2599
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:53,660
Yeah,
that's okay.

2600
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:56,960
But it was one of the first examples of 
the United States,

2601
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:57,913
like sort of collectively the will of 
the people like being openly expressed 

2602
02:03:01,821 --> 02:03:04,700
that the idea of entering Syria was 
outrageous.

2603
02:03:04,701 --> 02:03:07,010
Nobody wanted to do it.
They didn't make any sense to people.

2604
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:07,993
This gas attack.
Like how is this any more horrible than 

2605
02:03:10,191 --> 02:03:12,620
a lot of shit that's going on all over 
the world all the time.

2606
02:03:12,621 --> 02:03:13,454
What is that?
What is it about Syria that all of a 

2607
02:03:15,021 --> 02:03:15,854
sudden we have to go and invade Syria?
One more intervention in one more 

2608
02:03:18,711 --> 02:03:21,830
country in the United States.
Admit the administration backed off.

2609
02:03:22,410 --> 02:03:23,610
Great.
Great example.

2610
02:03:23,850 --> 02:03:26,160
People,
people are fed up with this and the fact

2611
02:03:26,161 --> 02:03:26,820
that,
uh,

2612
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:27,653
you know,
22 million people in Syria and 11 

2613
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:32,640
million of them have been displaced,
don't we?

2614
02:03:33,210 --> 02:03:36,570
Don't we have a share?
And in that consequence,

2615
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:37,890
well,
what was the motivation?

2616
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:38,873
What was the motivation for the United 
States wanted to invade their in the 

2617
02:03:40,261 --> 02:03:41,094
first place?

2618
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:42,173
Well,
it wasn't it a mccain going over there 

2619
02:03:44,641 --> 02:03:46,770
and beating his chest and,
uh,

2620
02:03:46,771 --> 02:03:47,790
along with,
uh,

2621
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:49,410
Lindsey Graham and,
uh,

2622
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:52,350
and let's go over there and support the 
good guys.

2623
02:03:52,351 --> 02:03:53,184
Well,
the good guys are the minority and the 

2624
02:03:54,631 --> 02:03:58,290
good guys at the end of the day,
um,

2625
02:03:58,650 --> 02:04:03,420
look,
this is where the somehow we're going to

2626
02:04:03,421 --> 02:04:05,370
determine the outcomes,
uh,

2627
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:07,140
in other countries.
I mean,

2628
02:04:07,141 --> 02:04:09,720
that's just,
it's preposterous that,

2629
02:04:09,721 --> 02:04:12,270
uh,
as individuals we can do that.

2630
02:04:12,410 --> 02:04:16,850
But this seems so contrary to what Obama
stood for before he got an office.

2631
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:19,640
So when he gets on television and talks 
about intervening,

2632
02:04:19,641 --> 02:04:21,350
going over to Syria about,
you know,

2633
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:24,610
there's gas attacks and all this jazz,
like where,

2634
02:04:24,611 --> 02:04:26,060
where's that motivation coming from?
Like,

2635
02:04:26,061 --> 02:04:28,670
who's behind him pushing him into this 
direction?

2636
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:31,850
Or is this just how he's been the entire
time?

2637
02:04:31,851 --> 02:04:32,684
And we just,
he just sold us a song and dance before 

2638
02:04:34,491 --> 02:04:35,420
he got into office.

2639
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:36,541
You,
you,

2640
02:04:36,541 --> 02:04:38,070
you off this,

2641
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,510
this kind of line of thought by saying 
we're,

2642
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:42,413
this is where I thought you were headed 
was can you get in and not be co opted 

2643
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:47,610
by the system?
Um,

2644
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:52,290
based on my ex only experience having 
been governor of New Mexico.

2645
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:53,280
Yeah,
you can't,

2646
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:57,960
meaning you can go that good government 
was easy.

2647
02:04:57,961 --> 02:05:01,230
It wasn't hard that you,
that you weren't co-opted.

2648
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:04,920
There was plenty of cooption that uh,
you know,

2649
02:05:04,921 --> 02:05:08,220
that tried to wield itself.
But you know what?

2650
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:09,870
You're the president of the United 
States.

2651
02:05:09,871 --> 02:05:11,520
You're the governor of a state.
You know,

2652
02:05:11,521 --> 02:05:13,440
you're,
you're at the top of the pyramid.

2653
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,131
You,
yes,

2654
02:05:14,131 --> 02:05:17,610
you do have limited powers,
but even with those limited powers,

2655
02:05:17,611 --> 02:05:19,740
you're still the most powerful human 
being on earth.

2656
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:20,773
Don't you think?
There's a pretty radical difference 

2657
02:05:21,801 --> 02:05:22,634
between being a governor of a state 
without a military and being the 

2658
02:05:24,651 --> 02:05:25,484
president of the United States dealing 
not just with the same sort of problems 

2659
02:05:29,691 --> 02:05:33,110
that you dealt with as a governor,
but on a much larger scale,

2660
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,033
plus the problems of the world,
plus the military plus the weird stuff 

2661
02:05:37,491 --> 02:05:40,770
like the NSA and the CIA.
And the NSA.

2662
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:45,650
Yeah.
And it has to be extremely more complex.

2663
02:05:45,651 --> 02:05:47,150
But at the end of the day,
do you,

2664
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:52,180
can you still tell the truth?
Can you still admit mistakes?

2665
02:05:52,430 --> 02:05:54,320
Um,
and you know,

2666
02:05:54,321 --> 02:05:55,154
if,
if you're willing to tell the truth and 

2667
02:05:56,151 --> 02:05:56,984
you're willing to admit mistakes,
mistakes seemed to have a way of 

2668
02:05:59,601 --> 02:06:00,434
compounding themselves when you don't 
admit the mistakes as in lieu of 

2669
02:06:03,201 --> 02:06:06,230
admitting the mistakes and then taking 
corrective action.

2670
02:06:06,710 --> 02:06:07,543
But really at the end of the day,
doesn't it boil down to telling the 

2671
02:06:10,371 --> 02:06:11,204
truth and um,
and fessing up to mistakes and fixing 

2672
02:06:13,531 --> 02:06:14,130
it?

2673
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:16,680
I would think so.
But it seems to me that the,

2674
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:17,993
the wiring of the office is so complex 
and there's so much craziness going on 

2675
02:06:23,251 --> 02:06:24,084
that no one gets in office and does what
they said they were going to do before 

2676
02:06:27,271 --> 02:06:31,290
they got an office because I'm almost 
seem insurmountable.

2677
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:35,360
That was not my experience.
That was not mine.

2678
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:38,550
As a governor,
governors have done what they've,

2679
02:06:38,890 --> 02:06:39,810
they've pledged.

2680
02:06:39,850 --> 02:06:42,220
Well.
So would you rather,

2681
02:06:42,221 --> 02:06:43,054
would you rather elect someone who has 
had the experience of not having been 

2682
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:48,480
co-opted,
uh,

2683
02:06:48,670 --> 02:06:49,503
as opposed to somebody who has been 
cooptive want one wants someone that's 

2684
02:06:54,971 --> 02:06:58,060
been cooptive at the end of the day.
Will I be,

2685
02:06:58,090 --> 02:06:58,923
would I,
if I'm elected president United States 

2686
02:07:00,611 --> 02:07:01,444
at the end of the day,
would I be able to make that same 

2687
02:07:03,131 --> 02:07:04,300
statement?
I hope so.

2688
02:07:04,301 --> 02:07:05,134
So

2689
02:07:05,210 --> 02:07:07,700
that's the best way to put it.
That's an honest way to put it.

2690
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:09,500
You hope so.
Cause it just,

2691
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:11,480
I,
I really would like to know.

2692
02:07:11,481 --> 02:07:12,314
I would love it if you became president 
and we could stay friends and I could 

2693
02:07:14,721 --> 02:07:15,554
go,
hey man,

2694
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:17,160
I won't tell anybody.
No,

2695
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:18,380
no.
We'll tell.

2696
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:20,630
We'll tell the world,
tell them on back here.

2697
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:22,520
We'll tell the world I don't want to get
shot with you.

2698
02:07:23,050 --> 02:07:26,870
I'm to run away.
I just,

2699
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:27,983
it's just the whole thing seems so 
almost impossibly intertwined that it's 

2700
02:07:34,551 --> 02:07:36,220
like a,
you go fishing.

2701
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,083
You ever go fishing?

2702
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:38,020
No,
I'm,

2703
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:40,330
I'm on my mountain bike as opposed to 
fishing.

2704
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:42,700
I do have a,
just a sidelight.

2705
02:07:42,701 --> 02:07:45,160
I do have a stream running through my,
uh,

2706
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:46,083
right by my house.
I have 1600 feet of frontage on the 

2707
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:52,300
Hondo River and it's loaded with 
taxpayer trout.

2708
02:07:52,330 --> 02:07:54,280
So give me,
give you an invitation to come.

2709
02:07:54,281 --> 02:07:54,520
Yeah.

2710
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:57,160
Beautiful Stream.
That would be like probably fly fishing,

2711
02:07:57,161 --> 02:07:57,994
right?
Um,

2712
02:07:58,120 --> 02:07:59,520
what I'm talking about is,
um,

2713
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:00,573
there's a thing called the bird's nest 
with a business is when you use a bait 

2714
02:08:03,461 --> 02:08:08,461
casting reel and the line spools quicker
than it can roll over it and it gets it,

2715
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:13,510
it becomes this gigantic tangle.
And when you,

2716
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:16,360
when you use a bait casting really 
supposed to sort of regulate it,

2717
02:08:16,361 --> 02:08:19,420
at least the old school ones,
you regulate the amount of pressure with

2718
02:08:19,421 --> 02:08:21,220
your thumb as to like,
uh,

2719
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:22,960
how fast the,
the wheel turns.

2720
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:23,853
The wheel turns too quick.
That line gets so tangled and it almost 

2721
02:08:26,141 --> 02:08:27,760
becomes impossible.
You look at it and you go,

2722
02:08:27,761 --> 02:08:29,080
shit,
what am I going to do with it?

2723
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:31,150
There's,
there's a perfect image.

2724
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:32,193
That's what a bird's nest looks like.
You see how all the line is all just 

2725
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:36,440
deal with it.

2726
02:08:36,440 --> 02:08:37,750
Good.
Try getting through that.

2727
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:40,360
That's a mess.
See when I think of the government,

2728
02:08:40,361 --> 02:08:44,170
I think of like that with bullets that 
like,

2729
02:08:44,171 --> 02:08:49,171
this is almost like the analogy branches
and it's almost like it's so tangled and

2730
02:08:50,621 --> 02:08:53,080
with all the other variables that you 
discussed,

2731
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:56,890
terms,
term limitations that are,

2732
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:58,560
that aren't in place,
um,

2733
02:08:58,630 --> 02:08:59,463
ideological blockades on the left and 
the right supporting your constituents 

2734
02:09:03,221 --> 02:09:05,950
on the left and the right special 
interest groups,

2735
02:09:06,010 --> 02:09:07,840
lobbyists,
the fact that there's,

2736
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:09,273
I mean there's this one area outside of 
Washington dc that is just all 

2737
02:09:13,451 --> 02:09:14,650
lobbyists,
this,

2738
02:09:14,651 --> 02:09:15,484
these neighborhoods and it's one of the 
wealthiest parts of the area and it's 

2739
02:09:18,311 --> 02:09:19,144
just because people are making insane 
amounts of money manipulating the 

2740
02:09:21,191 --> 02:09:22,024
system.

2741
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:23,120
So,
uh,

2742
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:24,003
I am advocating eliminating income tax 
and corporate tax and as a result of 

2743
02:09:28,781 --> 02:09:29,614
that,
wait a minute,

2744
02:09:30,150 --> 02:09:30,983
hit the brakes.
Did you just say you were talking about 

2745
02:09:35,490 --> 02:09:37,610
lobbyists?
Yeah,

2746
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,170
yeah.
How are you going to do that?

2747
02:09:41,210 --> 02:09:42,043
Eliminate income tax.
Eliminate corporate tax because you're 

2748
02:09:44,871 --> 02:09:45,704
going to do that.
You're going to also be able to abolish 

2749
02:09:47,811 --> 02:09:51,200
the irs and you can read,
Oh,

2750
02:09:51,201 --> 02:09:54,650
you just hear me out here.
Just a radical boulevard.

2751
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:55,583
You hear me out a couple more minutes 
and we would replace all of that with 

2752
02:09:59,781 --> 02:10:03,470
one federal consumption tax.
Now how do you do that?

2753
02:10:03,530 --> 02:10:05,420
While there's an actual proposal out 
there,

2754
02:10:05,421 --> 02:10:07,780
it's called the fair tax.
Uh,

2755
02:10:07,790 --> 02:10:08,623
and it's uh,
how you dot the i's and cross the t's 

2756
02:10:11,870 --> 02:10:16,340
when it comes to establishing one 
federal consumption tax.

2757
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:20,330
If we had zero corporate tax in this 
country,

2758
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:25,990
I believe tens of millions of jobs would
get created if we did not have corporate

2759
02:10:26,751 --> 02:10:29,450
tax.
If we did not have income tax,

2760
02:10:29,451 --> 02:10:34,451
I believe that pink slips would get 
issued to 80 of Washington

2761
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:38,990
lobbyists because that's why they're 
there to garner special tax favor.

2762
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:40,850
At the end of the day,
it's all about,

2763
02:10:41,490 --> 02:10:44,990
uh,
advantage and really that amounts to tax

2764
02:10:44,991 --> 02:10:45,824
money spent.
So how does this consumption tax work 

2765
02:10:49,431 --> 02:10:50,264
and how would you possibly implement and
how would you possibly get anyone to 

2766
02:10:54,741 --> 02:10:57,530
agree to do this?
To get rid of the irs,

2767
02:10:57,531 --> 02:10:59,480
to get rid of the,
yeah,

2768
02:10:59,481 --> 02:11:04,481
actually come to a couple hundred,
a couple hundred congressmen and women,

2769
02:11:04,650 --> 02:11:07,910
maybe 160 have actually signed on to 
this proposal.

2770
02:11:07,911 --> 02:11:10,310
So this proposal's been around for quite
a while.

2771
02:11:10,610 --> 02:11:12,740
And how many oppose it?
Well,

2772
02:11:12,741 --> 02:11:13,640
you got what,
how many?

2773
02:11:13,641 --> 02:11:17,040
400 f well by pose,
not necessarily opposed,

2774
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:18,620
but you know,
you haven't signed on,

2775
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:19,573
haven't signed on.
Well that would be more than half have 

2776
02:11:21,651 --> 02:11:24,320
not signed on,
but a significant number have.

2777
02:11:24,321 --> 02:11:26,810
So it's uh,
it's been vetted.

2778
02:11:26,811 --> 02:11:27,890
It's,
it's out there.

2779
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:29,850
Okay.
So this consumption tax,

2780
02:11:29,851 --> 02:11:31,070
yeah.
How does this work?

2781
02:11:31,490 --> 02:11:35,090
It would be a 28% consumption,
tossed the board on,

2782
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:38,720
on all new goods and services,
not used goods and services.

2783
02:11:38,721 --> 02:11:41,450
And before you fall off the chair,
the theory,

2784
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:44,150
the theory is that it wouldn't 
necessarily,

2785
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:45,013
it would be cost neutral.
So if I could use a can of coke as an 

2786
02:11:48,891 --> 02:11:51,980
example,
can of coke that sells for a buck today,

2787
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:53,473
um,
has a corporate tax contained in that 

2788
02:11:55,821 --> 02:11:58,010
book.
It has unemployment,

2789
02:11:58,030 --> 02:11:58,863
a contained in that book.
It has social security match contained 

2790
02:12:01,911 --> 02:12:02,744
in that book.
It has medicare a contained in that 

2791
02:12:05,421 --> 02:12:09,290
dollar.
It has the accounting fees and the legal

2792
02:12:09,291 --> 02:12:13,670
fees that go along with complying with 
the irs and the filing with the irs.

2793
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:17,420
So arguably the can of coke would not 
sell for a buck.

2794
02:12:17,421 --> 02:12:18,254
It would sell for 73 cents and then the 
28% tax would get applied to the can of 

2795
02:12:23,481 --> 02:12:23,780
coke.

2796
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:26,540
So you'd still end up paying a buck for 
the can of coke.

2797
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:27,763
That's the theory.
So by doing this and eliminating income 

2798
02:12:31,821 --> 02:12:32,654
tax,
how much different would the amount be 

2799
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:39,740
that the government receives?
This is intended to be revenue neutral,

2800
02:12:40,670 --> 02:12:41,503
revenue neutral.
So governments still gonna receive the 

2801
02:12:43,371 --> 02:12:45,200
same amount of money.
That's the,

2802
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:47,690
that's also the projection that how's 
that possible?

2803
02:12:47,691 --> 02:12:48,524
The people are not paying income tax.
I say if someone's wealthy filling out 

2804
02:12:50,980 --> 02:12:53,930
$1 million a year and you know $1 
million a year,

2805
02:12:53,931 --> 02:12:54,764
you're probably in a 48% tax bracket.
Take away all your tax shelters and all 

2806
02:12:58,491 --> 02:13:00,290
the various ways,
corporations,

2807
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:01,550
llcs,
all that jazz.

2808
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:03,530
You're,
you're in the 30s probably,

2809
02:13:03,531 --> 02:13:04,820
right?
That's a lot of money.

2810
02:13:04,821 --> 02:13:08,030
That's $300,000 so how much money are 
you?

2811
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:08,893
How are you going to welding that?
Well that if you're making a lot of 

2812
02:13:11,421 --> 02:13:12,830
money,
you spend a lot of money,

2813
02:13:12,831 --> 02:13:15,950
so you're going to pay that money and 
consumption tax,

2814
02:13:16,490 --> 02:13:18,350
scrooge mcduck and you just hanging 
back.

2815
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:20,810
Whoa.
Then that's a way that you can,

2816
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:23,030
uh,
isn't there a fairness in that?

2817
02:13:23,031 --> 02:13:26,600
But the reality is the more people make 
when it comes to money,

2818
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:30,050
the more people spend.
But if you want to save your money,

2819
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:32,580
when you say new and used,
does that apply to homes?

2820
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,560
Yup.
So a new home,

2821
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:37,320
you would have to pay 38% that would 
want to uphold the whole market,

2822
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:38,423
28% that would cripple the home market 
because no one would want to buy a new 

2823
02:13:41,731 --> 02:13:42,060
home.

2824
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:44,400
No,
but I'm back to back to the theory.

2825
02:13:44,401 --> 02:13:47,280
The right now you've got the,
when you,

2826
02:13:47,281 --> 02:13:50,010
when you enlist the aid of the plumbing 
company,

2827
02:13:50,011 --> 02:13:52,920
the plumbing company has,
so first of all,

2828
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:55,400
no more payroll deductions.
Um,

2829
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:58,210
the social security,
uh,

2830
02:13:58,330 --> 02:14:00,390
unemployment,
um,

2831
02:14:00,930 --> 02:14:01,763
medicare,
all of that would come out of the 

2832
02:14:03,421 --> 02:14:04,254
proceeds of one federal consumption tax.
So all government proceeds would come 

2833
02:14:10,141 --> 02:14:14,730
from this new pot of money.
So it's just a sales tax.

2834
02:14:14,731 --> 02:14:17,940
So instead of the plumber on your home,
uh,

2835
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:22,710
giving you a $100,000 bill for the 
plumbing,

2836
02:14:22,750 --> 02:14:23,583
uh,
theoretically the bill will be 73 grand 

2837
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:29,060
with me.
So it's not the,

2838
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:29,730
the,
the,

2839
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:33,540
the theory is the house really isn't 
going to cost you any more.

2840
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:34,890
Um,
uh,

2841
02:14:34,891 --> 02:14:35,880
because,
uh,

2842
02:14:35,881 --> 02:14:38,970
all these hidden taxes that exist are 
going to go away.

2843
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:41,940
Hmm.
That sounds cute.

2844
02:14:42,810 --> 02:14:44,520
It's theory.
Well,

2845
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:47,070
and let me,
let me also just say,

2846
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:47,963
uh,
I'm looking to get elected president of 

2847
02:14:49,501 --> 02:14:50,880
the United States.
Um,

2848
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:55,050
I'm going to sign on to what I think is 
going to make anything better.

2849
02:14:55,650 --> 02:14:59,820
But when you talk about making things 
really better,

2850
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:04,140
I think this is a proposal that 
simplifies all of our lives in a,

2851
02:15:04,141 --> 02:15:06,920
in a huge way.
Imagine not having to

2852
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:09,380
deal with the irs.
It would be tremendous,

2853
02:15:09,381 --> 02:15:10,214
but you would also put all those people 
out of jobs and they're going to fight 

2854
02:15:13,431 --> 02:15:14,270
for that.
They're going to,

2855
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:16,370
they're going to charge it against that.
That'd be a job.

2856
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:17,110
That would be

2857
02:15:17,110 --> 02:15:19,440
the accounting and the,
and the,

2858
02:15:19,441 --> 02:15:20,400
uh,
uh,

2859
02:15:20,401 --> 02:15:21,234
attorney fees that go along with 
complying with the irs and the irs 

2860
02:15:24,391 --> 02:15:25,470
employees themselves.

2861
02:15:25,550 --> 02:15:28,100
And if you think about the pressure that
the police unions or the,

2862
02:15:28,101 --> 02:15:28,934
the guard unions rather prison guard 
unions put to make sure that marijuana 

2863
02:15:32,211 --> 02:15:35,690
is still remains illegal and drug laws 
remained in place,

2864
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:36,733
imagine the kind of pressure that 
lobbyists and the irs and anyone else 

2865
02:15:40,131 --> 02:15:40,964
that might be affected by these 
decisions are going to put to try to 

2866
02:15:42,441 --> 02:15:44,000
stop this from happening.
Well,

2867
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:45,193
this is,
this though would be a dialogue if you 

2868
02:15:47,841 --> 02:15:49,520
had a,
in this case,

2869
02:15:49,521 --> 02:15:50,354
Gary Johnson onstage in the presidential
debates talking about something like 

2870
02:15:54,261 --> 02:15:55,770
this.
Um,

2871
02:15:56,090 --> 02:15:59,600
wouldn't,
that I'm maybe open people's eyes to the

2872
02:15:59,601 --> 02:16:03,920
fact that Whoa,
life could change dramatically.

2873
02:16:04,190 --> 02:16:07,700
Some would argue for the better.
I think at the end of the day you would,

2874
02:16:07,730 --> 02:16:11,900
you can argue that this would make life 
a lot better for everybody.

2875
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:15,200
Um,
we'll certainly stimulate a dialogue,

2876
02:16:15,201 --> 02:16:18,230
but I wonder if you can get that point 
across and those little soundbites it do

2877
02:16:18,231 --> 02:16:19,760
in those debates.
I think so.

2878
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,333
Um,
tens of millions of jobs would get 

2879
02:16:25,181 --> 02:16:29,980
created overnight here in the United 
States because of a zero tax rate.

2880
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,750
Why?
So why would you,

2881
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:32,613
why would you create a job anywhere in 
the world other than the United States 

2882
02:16:36,041 --> 02:16:40,510
given zero corporate taxes?
So you think that like apple would move,

2883
02:16:40,511 --> 02:16:43,270
their iphone factors are paying people 5
cents an hour.

2884
02:16:43,271 --> 02:16:44,104
They'd move into the United States and 
have to pay a working wage because they 

2885
02:16:46,571 --> 02:16:49,240
don't have to pay corporate taxes.
Wouldn't they cancel each other out?

2886
02:16:49,270 --> 02:16:54,250
Wouldn't it be more profitable to still 
invoke foreign labor and use third world

2887
02:16:54,251 --> 02:16:55,084
countries,
but they would have to pay that 

2888
02:16:56,051 --> 02:16:58,570
corporate tax in that foreign country?
I mean,

2889
02:16:58,600 --> 02:16:59,530
right,
but it's minimal,

2890
02:16:59,531 --> 02:17:00,021
right?
I mean,

2891
02:17:00,021 --> 02:17:00,700
no,
it's not me.

2892
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:03,540
It's not minimal,
but it's less so now.

2893
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:05,380
But now I'm back to,
hey,

2894
02:17:05,381 --> 02:17:06,214
I get elected president of United States
and I'm sue and I get legislation 

2895
02:17:09,580 --> 02:17:11,770
submitted to reduce corporate tax.
Yeah,

2896
02:17:11,771 --> 02:17:12,604
I'm going to sign on to that because I 
think it really is a hindrance to job 

2897
02:17:16,031 --> 02:17:19,120
creation when we have the highest 
corporate tax rate.

2898
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:22,840
But imagine instead of having a debate 
over,

2899
02:17:23,410 --> 02:17:24,243
should we reduce the corporate tax rate 
to 28% or 29% and Republicans and 

2900
02:17:28,561 --> 02:17:32,080
Democrats both get their peacock 
feathers all up in arms,

2901
02:17:32,081 --> 02:17:35,920
about 29 or 28 or 27 well,
how about zero?

2902
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:39,190
How about doing away with the irs?
Oh my gosh.

2903
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:40,860
Imagine the,
I mean if,

2904
02:17:40,861 --> 02:17:42,490
if,
if lowering it is good.

2905
02:17:42,491 --> 02:17:44,740
How about eliminating it?
Well,

2906
02:17:44,890 --> 02:17:48,610
I think you would get universal support 
from the United States.

2907
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:49,473
I mean from people in the country.
If you ask people how much do they love 

2908
02:17:52,061 --> 02:17:55,120
the United States irs system,
they would say zero.

2909
02:17:55,570 --> 02:17:56,403
I mean,
I don't think there's a single person 

2910
02:17:57,130 --> 02:17:58,900
other than people who work for the irs 
and says,

2911
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:00,520
I love them.
They're awesome.

2912
02:18:00,521 --> 02:18:02,230
I love when they go after your bank 
account.

2913
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:03,900
I love when they take all your money.
Yeah,

2914
02:18:03,901 --> 02:18:04,870
no,
you're right.

2915
02:18:04,871 --> 02:18:06,270
You're right.
No,

2916
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:06,550
no,
no.

2917
02:18:06,550 --> 02:18:07,890
I,
I'll drop the,

2918
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:12,190
I'll drop the thought completely because
of the love that does exist for the irs.

2919
02:18:12,191 --> 02:18:13,420
You're right.
No what I'm saying,

2920
02:18:13,421 --> 02:18:14,390
no one loves,
no,

2921
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:15,670
no,
don't know what I'm saying.

2922
02:18:15,790 --> 02:18:16,623
I do mean everyone hates it.
So everyone wouldn't hate you would get 

2923
02:18:18,641 --> 02:18:20,650
a hundred percent support.
Well,

2924
02:18:20,651 --> 02:18:21,940
no,
there's nothing.

2925
02:18:22,990 --> 02:18:25,360
There's no such thing as a hundred 
percent,

2926
02:18:26,220 --> 02:18:28,280
but obviously,
but how about the how,

2927
02:18:28,290 --> 02:18:29,470
how about,
you know,

2928
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:31,660
how about this entering into the,
uh,

2929
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:34,240
the debate?
Yeah.

2930
02:18:34,241 --> 02:18:35,880
What would be a great thing to talk 
about?

2931
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:38,800
Because the system is not good and no 
one thinks it is.

2932
02:18:38,801 --> 02:18:42,130
So the idea of keeping it exactly the 
way it is seems pretty ridiculous,

2933
02:18:42,310 --> 02:18:42,761
right?
I mean,

2934
02:18:42,761 --> 02:18:43,594
that's like the definition of insanity,
doing the same thing over and over 

2935
02:18:45,731 --> 02:18:47,260
again,
expecting different results.

2936
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:49,090
It's crony capitalism.
It's,

2937
02:18:49,091 --> 02:18:49,924
you know,
those that have money pay less of their 

2938
02:18:52,961 --> 02:18:53,790
share.

2939
02:18:53,790 --> 02:18:55,720
Um,
this really at the,

2940
02:18:55,721 --> 02:18:58,210
at the end of the day is very fair.
Right.

2941
02:18:58,390 --> 02:19:01,840
So thinking of that,
and along those lines,

2942
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:07,240
how do you feel about corporations 
donating to political candidates?

2943
02:19:07,930 --> 02:19:12,100
I have no issue with corporations 
donating to political candidates.

2944
02:19:12,101 --> 02:19:12,934
But the problem today is,
are these super pacs that are 100% 

2945
02:19:17,350 --> 02:19:18,183
nontransparent.
You have no idea who's contributing to 

2946
02:19:21,071 --> 02:19:25,420
these superpacs make,
make for unlimited contribution.

2947
02:19:25,421 --> 02:19:28,520
Just make the contributions hundred 
percent transparent.

2948
02:19:28,550 --> 02:19:31,660
I'm the one that said candidate should 
wear,

2949
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:32,553
um,
nascar like jackets with that was Robin 

2950
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:36,110
Williams.
Actually,

2951
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:37,280
I actually,
that was me.

2952
02:19:37,281 --> 02:19:39,020
Maybe.
Maybe he got it from me.

2953
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:41,690
He used to do a hit a bit about it on 
hbo show.

2954
02:19:41,691 --> 02:19:43,910
He didn't go to sleep with the TV on.
No,

2955
02:19:43,911 --> 02:19:47,690
I think I had this first.
I think I do have this first.

2956
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:49,670
Tell me what the year was.
Let's do google it.

2957
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:50,563
Well,
uh,

2958
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,100
yeah,
no deal.

2959
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:53,190
Google it.
You know,

2960
02:19:53,191 --> 02:19:55,400
it's Robin Williams ripped you off.
That would be brutal.

2961
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:56,390
No,
I'm not.

2962
02:19:56,510 --> 02:19:58,320
There's no rip off.
You might have,

2963
02:19:58,460 --> 02:20:02,930
but this would have been,
I had been saying this in 2009.

2964
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:05,630
I think he might've got ya.
Well maybe so,

2965
02:20:05,631 --> 02:20:06,660
but,
but,

2966
02:20:06,890 --> 02:20:10,580
but I'm not,
I'm not infringing on his stuff.

2967
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:14,330
I thought it was original.
I want to think of special was in 2006.

2968
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:15,223
I want to think,
I wonder if you might be parallel 

2969
02:20:18,051 --> 02:20:18,884
thinking it doesn't mean yes,
that's the problem with intellectual 

2970
02:20:22,791 --> 02:20:26,300
property is a weight look.
If it's parallel thinking,

2971
02:20:26,430 --> 02:20:29,210
certainly I'm not the only other one 
either.

2972
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:30,133
I mean,
I'm sure there are probably a hundred 

2973
02:20:31,701 --> 02:20:33,140
people listening right now that are 
going,

2974
02:20:33,141 --> 02:20:35,420
no,
I said that first 100%.

2975
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:37,550
Well,
it's a pretty obvious connection,

2976
02:20:37,551 --> 02:20:38,510
right?
You see Nascar,

2977
02:20:38,511 --> 02:20:39,344
they're all covered with logos.
It stands out and you know who's 

2978
02:20:41,751 --> 02:20:43,190
sponsoring or the logo.

2979
02:20:43,190 --> 02:20:44,023
The more money,
the more money was controlling the 

2980
02:20:45,471 --> 02:20:46,610
direct.
I mean this,

2981
02:20:46,611 --> 02:20:46,881
the,
the,

2982
02:20:46,881 --> 02:20:50,810
the direct comparison because they're 
the most obvious sponsor thing.

2983
02:20:50,811 --> 02:20:53,030
The car sponsored,
their jackets are sponsored,

2984
02:20:53,031 --> 02:20:55,070
everything's covered in logos.
They're like,

2985
02:20:55,071 --> 02:20:56,870
if you look at basketball players,
you don't see that,

2986
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:57,733
you know,
it's very rare that you see any sort of 

2987
02:20:59,991 --> 02:21:02,330
a sporting event where they're covered 
with logos like that.

2988
02:21:02,331 --> 02:21:03,164
So what,
what year that's coming this next 

2989
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:06,553
season,
what the NBA is adding all those logos 

2990
02:21:07,551 --> 02:21:10,250
to all their things.
I'm writing one.

2991
02:21:10,480 --> 02:21:12,110
Yeah,
they're earning one logo.

2992
02:21:12,111 --> 02:21:16,280
And this is a way was actually argued 
against the reebok deal for the UFC.

2993
02:21:17,170 --> 02:21:18,430
Um,
I,

2994
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:19,673
I,
I get real concerned with a superpacs 

2995
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:23,053
for sure.
I get real concerned with money and 

2996
02:21:25,101 --> 02:21:25,934
politics and that is a,
I think one of the reasons why Bernie 

2997
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:32,930
Sanders has stood out.
It's cause he's the only guy that is not

2998
02:21:32,931 --> 02:21:33,764
really accepting money from these giant 
corporations and he's fairly self 

2999
02:21:36,711 --> 02:21:37,460
funded.

3000
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:38,293
One of them.
One of the misconceptions about a 

3001
02:21:39,890 --> 02:21:40,723
campaign finances is that one of the 
misconceptions is that if you limit 

3002
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:45,703
campaign contribution that um,
that things are going to get better and 

3003
02:21:50,510 --> 02:21:51,343
you're going to eliminate the influence 
of big money when the reality is by 

3004
02:21:54,501 --> 02:21:57,260
limiting campaign contribution.
You basically,

3005
02:21:57,261 --> 02:22:02,261
that's an incumbency protection act.
So limiting campaign contribution is all

3006
02:22:04,431 --> 02:22:07,490
about reelecting incumbents.
That's what it's all about.

3007
02:22:08,210 --> 02:22:09,043
Look,
if you,

3008
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:12,740
if you could get,
if somebody would finance me to the tune

3009
02:22:12,741 --> 02:22:13,574
of $1 billion,
they might change this country in a 

3010
02:22:16,551 --> 02:22:20,540
really big way.
Should the billion dollars be anonymous?

3011
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:21,403
I don't think so.
I think that it should be front and 

3012
02:22:22,671 --> 02:22:25,800
center and whom ever contributed.
That should be known

3013
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:29,120
completely.
And that a,

3014
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:34,130
their goal was to change America and by 
giving Gary Johnson a billion bucks,

3015
02:22:34,850 --> 02:22:37,350
um,
I have the opportunity to do that,

3016
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:38,693
that it just be transparent as opposed 
to having to take 500,000 contributions 

3017
02:22:45,541 --> 02:22:47,500
at $2,000.
Um,

3018
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:49,950
which has,
which has,

3019
02:22:49,980 --> 02:22:53,430
which at the end of the day has more of 
a corrupting influence,

3020
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:54,513
more of a corrupting influence and one 
super rich person that wants to 

3021
02:22:56,651 --> 02:22:58,210
influence your decision making.

3022
02:22:58,240 --> 02:22:59,020
Well,
uh,

3023
02:22:59,020 --> 02:23:00,850
as an example,
governor of New Mexico,

3024
02:23:00,851 --> 02:23:05,620
my number one contributor of for two for
two terms,

3025
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:08,080
uh,
gave me $150,000.

3026
02:23:08,170 --> 02:23:09,850
May sound cheap too.
A lot of people,

3027
02:23:09,910 --> 02:23:12,630
but that doesn't sound cheap.
It sounds like a guy with a lot of money

3028
02:23:12,631 --> 02:23:14,240
you can throw 150 grand your way.
Yeah.

3029
02:23:14,430 --> 02:23:15,380
Eh,
and Eh,

3030
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:18,630
over an eight year old girl over an 
eight year period.

3031
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:20,130
Um,
he was,

3032
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:26,130
he was never,
not once did he call for anything.

3033
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:29,460
There was never any requests.
That's about rare though.

3034
02:23:29,461 --> 02:23:31,080
No.
Well,

3035
02:23:31,470 --> 02:23:33,680
maybe,
but my point is,

3036
02:23:33,681 --> 02:23:34,514
is it,
if I would have had a thousand 

3037
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:37,560
contributors,
uh,

3038
02:23:37,980 --> 02:23:40,530
giving me 150.
Right,

3039
02:23:40,531 --> 02:23:41,364
I see what you're saying.
$1,500 get a hundred people giving me 

3040
02:23:44,911 --> 02:23:45,744
$1,500.
I guarantee a Joe that 10 of them at 

3041
02:23:49,351 --> 02:23:50,980
some point would have been on the phone

3042
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:52,430
wanting something.
Right.

3043
02:23:52,431 --> 02:23:53,580
Guarantee it.
Uh,

3044
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:54,930
okay.
I,

3045
02:23:54,980 --> 02:23:55,940
this is,
um,

3046
02:23:56,030 --> 02:23:57,320
it's pretty anecdotal.
Don't know.

3047
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:58,513
I mean,
you're talking about one contributor 

3048
02:23:59,511 --> 02:24:01,790
versus if you're looking at someone 
who's,

3049
02:24:01,791 --> 02:24:05,180
or who's trying to contribute though to 
the United States,

3050
02:24:05,181 --> 02:24:08,270
to someone running for the United States
and if they give you $1 billion,

3051
02:24:08,271 --> 02:24:11,270
one person who gives you $1 billion,
that guy's going to want some,

3052
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:13,940
he's gonna want something.
I don't think,

3053
02:24:13,941 --> 02:24:14,720
I really don't think it's that.

3054
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:16,340
So let's,
let's,

3055
02:24:16,370 --> 02:24:19,700
let's use a more realistic term.
A billionaire that wants a,

3056
02:24:19,701 --> 02:24:20,534
you know,
a multibillionaire that wants to give 

3057
02:24:21,801 --> 02:24:25,130
$10 million bill gates or someone like 
someone like that.

3058
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:26,320
Yeah.
Is it,

3059
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:28,160
is it,
is it,

3060
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:29,653
is it inconceivable that there is that 
there aren't a whole bunch of those 

3061
02:24:33,471 --> 02:24:34,304
people out there that would just be 
looking for good government and just be 

3062
02:24:38,091 --> 02:24:38,924
looking to back that the candidate of 
their choice based on what it was they 

3063
02:24:42,441 --> 02:24:43,390
were saying?
Not On,

3064
02:24:43,690 --> 02:24:46,490
not on.
I don't think it's inconceivable at all,

3065
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:50,840
but just let's all know who that 
contributor was and how much money.

3066
02:24:51,570 --> 02:24:52,403
Well,
I understand that the transparency 

3067
02:24:54,361 --> 02:24:56,250
aspect,
that sort of makes sense.

3068
02:24:56,251 --> 02:24:57,084
But boy,
having one person that influences 

3069
02:24:59,550 --> 02:25:01,800
politics that much,
it's concerning.

3070
02:25:01,830 --> 02:25:03,840
It concerns people.
And I think rightly so,

3071
02:25:03,841 --> 02:25:07,980
because someone who has that much money,
who they are,

3072
02:25:07,981 --> 02:25:11,460
they're already in this very strong,
advantageous position.

3073
02:25:11,461 --> 02:25:16,461
And the only reason why you would 
rationally give someone $1 billion is if

3074
02:25:16,471 --> 02:25:18,690
you thought that it was going to be an 
advantage to you.

3075
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:21,870
You are going to somehow or another reap
the rewards of giving them that money.

3076
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:23,890
Good government.
So,

3077
02:25:23,970 --> 02:25:24,340
um,

3078
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:25,173
in my,
I'd never been involved in politics 

3079
02:25:27,371 --> 02:25:29,440
before,
running for governor of New Mexico.

3080
02:25:29,470 --> 02:25:31,350
Never knew businessman,
successful,

3081
02:25:31,351 --> 02:25:34,090
but never,
never even pounded in a campaign sign.

3082
02:25:34,180 --> 02:25:35,470
Well,
how did I get elected?

3083
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:37,570
Well,
I paid for my own campaign.

3084
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,070
Uh,
my primary,

3085
02:25:39,071 --> 02:25:41,410
this is gonna sound really cheap,
but my primary,

3086
02:25:41,411 --> 02:25:42,244
the first time was $540,000.
510 of it was mine and 30 and 

3087
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:50,530
motivation,
just good government.

3088
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:51,393
The note it,
the notion of life and what do you do 

3089
02:25:53,081 --> 02:25:55,810
with your life?
And for me,

3090
02:25:55,811 --> 02:25:57,490
my entire life,
um,

3091
02:25:57,820 --> 02:25:59,140
politics,
um,

3092
02:25:59,170 --> 02:26:01,090
I,
I viewed it as a high calling.

3093
02:26:01,150 --> 02:26:01,983
You know,
the notion of being in a position to 

3094
02:26:03,731 --> 02:26:04,990
make things better.
Now,

3095
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:06,663
look,
I'm the first person to also admit that 

3096
02:26:07,931 --> 02:26:11,460
if you had people lined up,
or if you ask,

3097
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:12,963
asked how many,
how many are going to line up here to 

3098
02:26:14,501 --> 02:26:16,570
say Gary Johnson was a scourge of the 
earth.

3099
02:26:16,570 --> 02:26:17,171
Hey,
you know,

3100
02:26:17,171 --> 02:26:18,004
there'd be,
there'd be lines blocks long out out 

3101
02:26:20,351 --> 02:26:21,310
here.
I get it.

3102
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:22,173
I get it.
But you try and do their main criticism 

3103
02:26:23,591 --> 02:26:24,830
be no.
Um,

3104
02:26:24,970 --> 02:26:25,803
I don't think,
I don't think you'd actually have that 

3105
02:26:27,251 --> 02:26:28,084
happen,
but there's always criticism regardless 

3106
02:26:30,221 --> 02:26:31,054
of what you do.
And the motivation for what I've done 

3107
02:26:34,001 --> 02:26:38,740
always is to make things better.
But there are always people that,

3108
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:41,710
um,
have something contrary to say,

3109
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:43,360
no matter what.
I mean,

3110
02:26:43,361 --> 02:26:46,060
you could write an article about soccer 
and you're going to have 100 people,

3111
02:26:46,061 --> 02:26:47,080
man.
Well,

3112
02:26:47,081 --> 02:26:49,360
so I didn't have to go out and raise any
money.

3113
02:26:49,361 --> 02:26:51,790
I,
I gave him the money to myself.

3114
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:52,653
Well,
why can't you extend that argument and 

3115
02:26:54,341 --> 02:26:55,174
say that if somebody would've given me,
if one person would have given me that 

3116
02:26:58,871 --> 02:26:59,704
same $510,000,
that that person wouldn't have changed 

3117
02:27:03,701 --> 02:27:04,930
the uh,
uh,

3118
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:05,883
okay.
My contributor that gave me 150 grand 

3119
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:09,960
for good government.
Well he,

3120
02:27:09,980 --> 02:27:11,880
he had the ability to write,
you know,

3121
02:27:11,890 --> 02:27:14,590
he had the ability to give 510 grand 
and,

3122
02:27:14,650 --> 02:27:17,870
and essentially get me elected.
Wouldn't

3123
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:20,020
been.
Isn't that a good thing?

3124
02:27:20,380 --> 02:27:21,213
Well,
it's only a good thing if it's a good 

3125
02:27:21,851 --> 02:27:24,400
guy,
but we don't know that it's a good guy.

3126
02:27:24,401 --> 02:27:25,234
We just know it's a rich guy.
And the amount of influence of that one 

3127
02:27:27,611 --> 02:27:28,444
rich person has is very problematic to 
regular pan should be part of the 

3128
02:27:31,511 --> 02:27:32,344
equation on the analysis of is this 
having an impact and who is it and how 

3129
02:27:36,431 --> 02:27:38,560
much money have they given,
which currently,

3130
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:40,780
um,
these super pacs,

3131
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:43,510
100% non transparent.
Right?

3132
02:27:43,590 --> 02:27:46,360
But do you think the transparency 
protects you from influence?

3133
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:49,480
Like if it is transparent and you have 
like one of the Koch brothers,

3134
02:27:49,481 --> 02:27:50,880
it's given all the money up.
You,

3135
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:51,933
even if it's transparent,
you know what the hell their motivation 

3136
02:27:54,131 --> 02:27:56,470
is.
They want to continue to extract massive

3137
02:27:56,471 --> 02:27:57,340
amounts of money.
Right.

3138
02:27:57,430 --> 02:27:58,210
Well,
if,

3139
02:27:58,210 --> 02:28:00,580
if it's one person that's giving all the
money,

3140
02:28:00,581 --> 02:28:01,414
then there's that much more scrutiny 
that goes along with that person giving 

3141
02:28:04,391 --> 02:28:06,550
that much more money.
And um,

3142
02:28:06,630 --> 02:28:08,590
and you,
you'd have to think,

3143
02:28:09,130 --> 02:28:10,120
uh,
that,

3144
02:28:10,121 --> 02:28:10,954
uh,
the influence wouldn't be as blatant as 

3145
02:28:12,581 --> 02:28:14,950
it was if it was completely 
nontransparent.

3146
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:17,590
Yeah,
I'm a little skeptical.

3147
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:19,420
I'm also right.
That's okay.

3148
02:28:19,490 --> 02:28:20,323
Wait,
what did you think when the Supreme 

3149
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:22,070
Court,
the decision to allow

3150
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:24,710
corporations to donate as if they were 
individuals?

3151
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:26,750
It doesn't make much sense to me.
No,

3152
02:28:26,770 --> 02:28:29,480
it doesn't make much sense.
What do you think the motivation was for

3153
02:28:29,481 --> 02:28:31,730
that though?
Why would they pass something like that?

3154
02:28:33,690 --> 02:28:36,650
You know,
I am too far in the weeds,

3155
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:39,170
but they did it and it just doesn't make
any sense.

3156
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:40,610
It's kind of creepy though,
isn't it?

3157
02:28:40,740 --> 02:28:41,571
A little,
yeah,

3158
02:28:41,571 --> 02:28:43,970
I think so.
I like what you're saying.

3159
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:47,840
I really liked this idea of abolishing 
the irs a consumption tax.

3160
02:28:47,841 --> 02:28:52,250
I love the Iga of the fair tax,
check out the fair tax and,

3161
02:28:52,251 --> 02:28:54,530
and there are no fair taxes,
but like I say,

3162
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:59,210
dot the i's and cross the t's on how you
accomplish one federal consumption tax.

3163
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:01,310
To wrap this up,
I'm just going to give you the floor.

3164
02:29:01,490 --> 02:29:04,490
Just sell it,
sell it to the American people.

3165
02:29:04,491 --> 02:29:05,324
What is wrong,
what can be fixed and what can Gary 

3166
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:08,810
Johnson do to fix it?
I

3167
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:10,810
want to make a pitch for myself and that
is,

3168
02:29:10,811 --> 02:29:14,480
is that I think I really am a unique 
package.

3169
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:16,940
Uh,
I am fiscally conservative.

3170
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,380
Um,
I'm,

3171
02:29:18,490 --> 02:29:21,800
I'm as frugal a human being as you've 
ever met,

3172
02:29:21,890 --> 02:29:22,723
but that doesn't mean that I'm cheap.
It just means that I spend my money 

3173
02:29:26,001 --> 02:29:28,970
wisely.
I got to serve as governor of New Mexico

3174
02:29:28,971 --> 02:29:31,300
for two terms.
Uh,

3175
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:32,143
I served as governor of New Mexico for 
two terms as a Republican in the state 

3176
02:29:35,841 --> 02:29:36,674
that's two to one democrat.
I got reelected by a bigger margin the 

3177
02:29:39,291 --> 02:29:40,124
second time than the first time.
Made a name for myself as a real 

3178
02:29:43,971 --> 02:29:44,804
government skeptic vetoing legislation.
I may have vetoed more legislation than 

3179
02:29:48,141 --> 02:29:50,780
the other 49 governors in the country 
combined.

3180
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:53,150
Coupled with that,
um,

3181
02:29:53,570 --> 02:29:56,600
I'm socially tolerant.
I'm socially liberal.

3182
02:29:56,630 --> 02:29:57,463
Look,
you and I should be able to make 

3183
02:29:58,581 --> 02:29:59,414
decisions in our own lives that only 
affect our own lives as long as those 

3184
02:30:03,501 --> 02:30:06,350
decisions don't adversely affect others.

3185
02:30:07,190 --> 02:30:10,760
And then there is a very real terrorist 
threat out there.

3186
02:30:10,761 --> 02:30:12,490
It exists.
Um,

3187
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:13,663
but I do believe that our military 
interventions have resulted in making 

3188
02:30:17,781 --> 02:30:19,700
situations worse,
not better.

3189
02:30:19,701 --> 02:30:20,534
So I'm a real skeptic when it comes to 
government and the fact that government 

3190
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:26,660
is too big.
Uh,

3191
02:30:26,661 --> 02:30:29,480
I've been an entrepreneur my entire 
life.

3192
02:30:29,481 --> 02:30:30,314
I know what it is to a hire and fire.
I know what it is to share in the 

3193
02:30:33,921 --> 02:30:34,754
profits.
And what a magic formula that is that 

3194
02:30:36,981 --> 02:30:37,814
when you share in the profits,
amazingly the profit pie grows 

3195
02:30:41,151 --> 02:30:43,460
significantly.
Uh,

3196
02:30:43,461 --> 02:30:48,461
I've been an athlete my entire life.
Bit of an oxymoron is a 63 year old,

3197
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:51,530
but what athletics has taught me is,
you know,

3198
02:30:51,531 --> 02:30:54,440
life is putting one foot in front of the
other.

3199
02:30:54,441 --> 02:30:58,580
Athletics has taught me that anything 
that can go wrong will go wrong.

3200
02:30:59,420 --> 02:31:03,800
It's how you deal with failure that 
ultimately determines your success.

3201
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:06,680
Look,
things go wrong all the time.

3202
02:31:06,681 --> 02:31:08,580
You can crawl up on the couch,
uh,

3203
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:11,420
you can declare yourself a victim.
You can give up,

3204
02:31:11,421 --> 02:31:12,254
or you can recognize that that's just 
part of life and wake up the next day 

3205
02:31:15,531 --> 02:31:20,070
with a smile on your face and continue 
to move forward and just do your

3206
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:22,200
best.
I've told,

3207
02:31:22,410 --> 02:31:24,260
I've told the truth.
Uh,

3208
02:31:24,261 --> 02:31:27,750
I think it's really hard to do any 
damage to somebody who's willing to tell

3209
02:31:27,751 --> 02:31:30,030
the truth,
regardless of the consequences.

3210
02:31:30,031 --> 02:31:34,230
And then I admit mistakes.
I think mistakes have a way of,

3211
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:38,550
so compounding themselves just because 
people don't acknowledge those mistakes.

3212
02:31:38,551 --> 02:31:43,551
So given this pitch,
all I want to do is just get in,

3213
02:31:43,890 --> 02:31:44,723
uh,
the polls that determines who is in the 

3214
02:31:48,061 --> 02:31:48,894
presidential debates.
I think that if I'm in the presidential 

3215
02:31:52,141 --> 02:31:52,974
debates,
I have an opportunity of actually 

3216
02:31:54,451 --> 02:31:59,451
winning because of this package that 
you've allowed me to present here today.

3217
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:01,800
Oh,
thank you.

3218
02:32:01,930 --> 02:32:03,070
Well,
I appreciate you coming on,

3219
02:32:03,071 --> 02:32:03,910
sir.
I really do.

3220
02:32:03,911 --> 02:32:06,520
It was a very enjoyable talking to you.
And,

3221
02:32:06,521 --> 02:32:07,750
uh,
I hope you win,

3222
02:32:07,751 --> 02:32:08,590
man.
I really do.

3223
02:32:08,591 --> 02:32:11,470
I hope you,
I hope you at least at the very least,

3224
02:32:11,650 --> 02:32:12,483
make enough headway to get people paying
attention to you and to get into the 

3225
02:32:16,451 --> 02:32:18,520
Poles and just to listen to your 
message.

3226
02:32:19,130 --> 02:32:19,963
And if I'm in the presidential debates,
that means I'm representing 25 million 

3227
02:32:23,151 --> 02:32:26,270
people.
So what comes out of my mouth if I don't

3228
02:32:26,271 --> 02:32:29,060
end up getting more votes than the other
two candidates,

3229
02:32:29,061 --> 02:32:30,590
the one that does,
you know what?

3230
02:32:30,591 --> 02:32:32,690
They're not blind to the fact that,
Whoa,

3231
02:32:32,691 --> 02:32:33,524
this guy's sitting over here.
He's representing 25 million people 

3232
02:32:36,591 --> 02:32:37,424
because he's in the debates.
So we better pick up a little bit on 

3233
02:32:40,371 --> 02:32:43,190
what he has to say,
cause they're going to see some sense in

3234
02:32:43,191 --> 02:32:44,330
it also.
Anyway,

3235
02:32:44,331 --> 02:32:44,800
thank you,

3236
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:46,270
Gary Johnson.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3237
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:47,471
thank you very much,
sir.

3238
02:32:47,471 --> 02:32:48,530
I really appreciate that.
Thank you.

3239
02:32:48,531 --> 02:32:49,364
Thank you.
Thank you.

3240
02:33:03,410 --> 02:33:04,243
Okay.

3241
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:07,433
Yeah.
