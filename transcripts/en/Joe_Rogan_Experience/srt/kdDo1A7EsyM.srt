00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,930
Hello Freak bitches.
People are really reluctant to give up

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,990
fun shit like lying and driving their
car fast like those two things.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,160
People are gonna have a hard time with
you,

4
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:14,770
like actually getting into the,
into their mind,

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:17,920
seeing their actual mind and being able
to do that so we can know without a

6
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:19,930
doubt whether or not someone's guilty or
innocent.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,800
But my question to you is if you could
get inside someone's mind and it was

8
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:28,801
like that really super.
I'm a suggestive guy they were talking

9
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:33,490
about earlier that just confessed all
the horrific demonic possession stuff

10
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,790
and eating babies.
What if it's like getting to that guy's

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,350
mind?
What if you can't tell?

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,733
Well,

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,330
be the case that,
that worries me,

14
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:50,280
and this is perhaps an inept segue to
politics,

15
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,150
but the um,

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,970
in people's minds,
what you get,

17
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,990
you get someone talking long enough,
you know their minds.

18
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:01,681
I mean they,
they,

19
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:05,450
they can only conceal what they're about
a only so.

20
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:08,180
Well,
and you can because you're a super smart

21
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:09,240
wizard type.
No,

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,610
but Jamie,
I don't know,

23
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:13,940
but I don't know if he's a mind reader,
but the question is what will people

24
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:14,870
care,
you know,

25
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:17,000
it's like if you,
if you have,

26
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,840
we don't even need a lie detector.
If you have someone who's openly line,

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,790
right,
who,

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,200
who just gets caught in lies again and
again,

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,750
you could see it too,
you feel it,

30
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:29,050
right?
But people don't seem to care right in,

31
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,540
at least in the political process.
And I'm thinking in this case of trump

32
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,570
where you have someone who is in,
in some cases line or just changing his

33
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:43,901
mind in such an incoherent way that,
um,

34
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,280
it's the functional equivalent of line.

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,960
I mean,
it's someone who becomes totally

36
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:51,410
unpredictable.
He has a stance that is a on Tuesday and

37
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:56,150
it's be on Wednesday.
And when the discrepancy is pointed out,

38
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:57,500
he tells her to go fuck yourself.
Right?

39
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:58,700
So it's just,
there's just no,

40
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,510
there is no accountability to his,
his own states of consciousness that

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,170
he's going to be held to.
And the people who love him don't seem

42
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,040
to care.
They actually,

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,060
in as far as I can tell,
I don't know so many of these people

44
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:17,570
personally,
but from based on social media and

45
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:21,410
seeing a few articles where someone has
explained why they love trump.

46
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,390
People view this as a kind of this sort
of this dishonesty,

47
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:30,950
what is,
in my view,

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,040
both dishonesty and a kind of a kind of
theatrical hucksterism.

49
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:40,610
I started sort of person who's who's
pretending to be many things that he

50
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:41,444
probably hasn't.

51
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,690
They see it as a new kind of
authenticity,

52
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,733
right?
Like this guy,

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,160
he's just letting it rip.
He doesn't care what what is true.

54
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,800
He doesn't care what your expectations
for coherence are.

55
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,800
He's just going to tell you to fuck
yourself every which way.

56
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,760
And this is the new way of being honest,
right?

57
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,430
This is a new form of into integrity.
It's amazing to watch.

58
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,960
It was.
It's getting.

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,820
It has been.
I'm someone who actually,

60
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:10,810
I remember on my own podcast,
I think I was talking to Paul Bloom,

61
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,900
this psychologist who's,
who's great and we had taught.

62
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,140
We got into politics and this is at
least a year ago,

63
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:20,140
but at that point I said,
there's no way we're going to be talking

64
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,040
about trump in a year.
I mean,

65
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,260
this is kind of completely flame out,
and I was.

66
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,840
This is A.
I don't tend to make predictions,

67
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,900
but this was a clear moment that I
remember making a prediction,

68
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:33,820
which is now obviously false,
but I just couldn't imagine it that this

69
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:38,821
was where people were going to find this
compelling enough to for for him to be

70
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:40,990
on the,
on the cusp of getting elected.

71
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,300
It's.
It is terrifying.

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,250
Have you taught,
have you taught this issue to death on

73
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:47,920
your podcast or.
I guess we kind of have.

74
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,030
Well,
I think this is how everybody feels.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,080
Everybody feels like you're supposed to
be like with their person,

76
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,320
whether it's Bernie or whether it's for
Hillary or whether you're a trump

77
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,720
supporter or whatever it is,
like you have to be all in,

78
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,290
but if you look at the choices that
we're given,

79
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,050
the.
None of these kids really be described

80
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:06,821
as ideal.
No,

81
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,090
no.
Like Hillary Clinton.

82
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:11,420
You could want a woman in the White
House and you want to want to show

83
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:14,540
everyone that a woman can do that job
just as well as a man and she's got the

84
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,970
most experience.
She certainly has the most experience

85
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:19,880
dealing with foreign governments and she
certainly has the most experience in

86
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,870
politics,
can make an easy,

87
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,180
but she's also involved in to criminal
investigations.

88
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:30,181
She had an observer and her bathroom
squirrely stuff going on like,

89
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:32,330
no,
she's.

90
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,380
She's terrible.
In many ways.

91
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,400
She was gay marriage,
2013 and then wouldn't admit the change

92
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:42,830
of mind either.
She's a politician,

93
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,580
she's a brilliant woman,
but she's also set in her ways and a

94
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:49,340
politician,
a politician to the end and part of

95
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,980
being a politician has been a fucking
huckster.

96
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,290
You got to be able to get those people
to see your side and the way you do that

97
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,750
is to talk like this.
You can't talk like a normal person

98
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,980
needs a speech coach.
They all do.

99
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:06,830
He's terrible to.
Trump's not even good at it and he

100
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:07,970
kicked their asses.
I know,

101
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,350
but who knows,
but her voice or she.

102
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,040
She has a kind of,
to use the sexist trope,

103
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,950
she has a shrill voice when you,
when you get her

104
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,590
in front of a mic and there's a crowd
and she thinks she's talking over the

105
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:21,030
crowd,
which he doesn't have to do because

106
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:24,600
she's in front of a mic.
The sound you get is just,

107
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,570
it's his.
She's yelling when she doesn't need to

108
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:30,550
yell at someone.
Someone has to teach her how to dial

109
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,060
that back.

110
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,130
What you just did is called
mansplaining.

111
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,130
I'm explaining to the men and her crew
who should,

112
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,440
who should talk some sense into her,
but she is,

113
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,360
she's a,
she's a bad candidate,

114
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,250
right?
I have no doubt that she's

115
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,180
very smart and she's well informed and
she's qualified and she is absolutely

116
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:51,860
who I will vote for,
given the choices.

117
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,970
Um,
but you know,

118
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,610
I totally understand people's with her.
She's a liar.

119
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:03,430
She's an opportunist.
She's just almost preternaturally and

120
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:04,221
authentic.
I mean,

121
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:07,550
she's just like,
she will just focus group every third

122
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,710
sentence and you feel that from her.
Right?

123
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,200
And,
and this is all true.

124
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,210
And yet,
I also believe that people who say I've

125
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:16,640
never met her,
but people who know her and I've met her

126
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,270
say that,
you know,

127
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,320
behind closed doors,
you know,

128
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:21,120
one on one,
she's incredibly impressive and,

129
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,220
and great.
Um,

130
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,520
but that doesn't translate into her
candidacy.

131
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:28,070
She probably thinks she has to do it.
Old School,

132
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,330
you know,
I mean,

133
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:31,010
the way she's doing it,
but she,

134
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,940
I mean,
the thing is,

135
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,790
she's,
when you look at the,

136
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,530
what's worked,
what worries me?

137
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,460
So I went on facebook the other day and
I've said very little about this,

138
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:44,870
but I've made enough noise is sort that
I just made that people understand that

139
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:45,704
I,
that I'm,

140
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,850
you know,
for Clinton,

141
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:49,640
despite all my reservations about her,
um,

142
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,490
and when I got on my own facebook page,
which you have to assume is filtered by

143
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,380
the people who are following me on
facebook and,

144
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,530
and already liked me in some sense,
just like a thousand comments of pure

145
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,101
pain.
I mean,

146
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,660
no one loves hillary.
No one,

147
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:06,291
no one said,
oh,

148
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,680
thank God someone's,
someone's smart is for Hillary.

149
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,360
It was all just Bernie people and trump
people flaming me for,

150
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,370
for,
for the,

151
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,560
the most tepid possible endorsement of
Clinton.

152
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:20,360
All I said was,
listen,

153
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,830
I understand,
you know,

154
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:25,760
Clinton is a liar and she's,
and she's an opportunist and she's,

155
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,620
um,
I,

156
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,630
I completely get your reservations about
her,

157
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,120
but at least she's grown up,
right?

158
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,600
And
she's going to be the candidate.

159
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,760
It's not going to be sanders facilities
at the moment.

160
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,960
Now is the moment to put your political
idealism behind you if you're a sanders

161
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,470
person and recognize that there is a
vast difference between Clinton and

162
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:47,060
trump and no itch.
No,

163
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,370
she's not going to change the system,
but she's also not going to run

164
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,780
civilization off a cliff.
Right?

165
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,350
And I didn't,
I forget how I said it on facebook,

166
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:56,030
but it was just the most.
It was just,

167
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,490
it really was a lesser of two evils
argument.

168
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,490
And it just,
it was,

169
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:04,070
um,
it's amazing to see how energized and

170
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:07,580
passionate people are in defensive trump
and sanders.

171
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,130
And there's almost none of that for
Clinton.

172
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,810
It's like people are just sheepishly
saying that they do just divulging that

173
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,510
they will vote for Clinton.
Um,

174
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,210
but they are,
they may be somewhere that I haven't

175
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,090
noticed.
Someone loves,

176
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,730
absolutely loves Clinton,
but it's just,

177
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:24,890
it's.
She does not have her defenders the way

178
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:27,560
these guys do.
Have you seen the man enough to vote for

179
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,780
her campaign?
No.

180
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,130
No.
It's with like hipster dudes with

181
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,560
tattoos and beards that are going to
vote for Hillary.

182
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,680
You know,
I hope it's fake because it's so

183
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,360
brilliant.
I hope it's not real.

184
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,630
Is it fake?
Is it?

185
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,960
Thank God.
It's so good though,

186
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,290
because it's not that fake.
It's pretty good.

187
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,120
Like you could almost see.

188
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,910
So wait a minute.
I mean,

189
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,070
this is not bad for

190
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,521
her,
right?

191
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:57,480
This is.
No,

192
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:57,931
no,
no.

193
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:01,920
It's not bad for.
Just funny that someone would make a

194
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,430
joke,
political ad that you have to be man

195
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,460
enough to vote for Hillary.
Like there's guys out there that would

196
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:10,020
buy that.
They would,

197
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,570
they would,
they do it.

198
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,390
It's a scary time because it doesn't
seem like anybody that you would want to

199
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,320
be president wants to be president.
And so we're left with,

200
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,460
all right,
what do you pick?

201
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,180
It's like as if we're going to play the
super bowl with three of the shittiest

202
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,880
teams we could find.
We're just going to go get some drunk

203
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:33,330
high school kids,
get some inmates with club feet.

204
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:36,060
We're just going to throw whoever we're
going to have the worst game ever.

205
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,310
And this was what this game is.
It's not a good game.

206
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,580
This is not a game where you've got like
a John F Kennedy versus a Lyndon Johnson

207
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:48,870
or it's not.
It's not like like powerful characters.

208
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,050
It's trump I guess is a really powerful
character,

209
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,770
but in more ways like a showman
character,

210
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,130
what he's doing,
he's like,

211
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,760
he's putting on a great show and he's
going to win probably because he's

212
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:06,000
putting on such a great show and people
like a great show.

213
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,440
But I do

214
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,560
think I'm now have among the people who
think something new,

215
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,230
we're witnessing witnessing something
new with trump.

216
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,320
It's not just the same old thing where
the process is so onerous that it's

217
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:26,701
selecting for the kind of narcissist or
thick skin person who is willing to

218
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:29,890
submit to the process.
And then there are many,

219
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,990
the,
most of the good people just aren't

220
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:33,640
going to put up with this.
I mean,

221
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:34,900
yes,
there's that too.

222
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,210
But there's,
um,

223
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,800
there's some,
there's a,

224
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,280
it's a moment among
the electorate where it's like,

225
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,920
it's fun.
It's an antistatic.

226
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,060
There's an ant,
there's enough of an antiestablishment

227
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,180
mood and vote.
Now is it happening with,

228
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,380
with sanders to,
um,

229
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,110
where people just want to jam a stick in
the wheel of the system just to see what

230
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:02,860
happens.
So it's like,

231
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:06,310
well,
this is the main gripe against Hillary

232
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,860
really is that she is politics as usual.

233
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,760
She's not going to change the system,
right?

234
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,290
People want to change the system,
but they're not really thinking about

235
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,900
the implications of radically changing
the system.

236
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,450
And in the case of trump,
um,

237
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,350
I may hear or someone who is,
who was advertising his lack of

238
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:29,830
qualifications for the office in every
way that he can,

239
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,380
like,
he,

240
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,590
like there's,
there is no,

241
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,910
I mean,
I'm not even,

242
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,350
I'm not even bothered by his racism or
his misogyny or his demagoguery or is

243
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,021
bully.
I mean,

244
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:45,520
all of that I'm willing to guess is an
act right.

245
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:48,190
That he's decided that that's somehow
pandering his base.

246
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,620
And he's actually,
in truth,

247
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:52,270
he doesn't have a racist bone in his
body.

248
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:55,240
Say I'm willing to,
to believe that I'm out.

249
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:57,580
I don't know why I would think that's
plausible,

250
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,500
but it's,
it's,

251
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,040
it's,
uh,

252
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,720
you know,
I have a hunch that he's far more

253
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,660
liberal than he seems and it's just
pandering.

254
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,170
But the thing that,
that

255
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,340
can't be true is there's no way he's
actually brilliant and well informed

256
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,570
about all the issues and saying the
things he's saying.

257
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:24,571
He's not pretending to be as uninformed
and as incoherent and as irresponsible

258
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,200
as he's seeming.
Um,

259
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,520
because you wouldn't withhold
information that will make you a better

260
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:31,151
leader.
Well,

261
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:31,661
it's just,
it's.

262
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:32,410
Yeah.
And it's just,

263
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,450
well,
it's just the vacuum busyness of his

264
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,590
speech.
It's like he's,

265
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,660
he'll say that he'll say the same thing
three times in a row and it was

266
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,520
meaningless the first time,
right?

267
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:44,320
He'll say,
it's going to be amazing.

268
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,940
It's going to be very,
very amazing.

269
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:47,350
Trust me,
it's going to be so amazing.

270
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,420
And he does.
He does this with everything.

271
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:53,800
If you look at the transcripts of his
speeches and the fact that he can't,

272
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,790
he has never so far as I've seen,
he has never once strung together a

273
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:06,451
string of sentences that was
even interesting.

274
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,653
Right?
But he'd be like,

275
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,740
he's,
he's never.

276
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,790
He just,
there's never a moment where I read or I

277
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,624
say,
Oh,

278
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,130
this guy is smarter and better informed
than I realized that that moment never

279
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,380
comes.
Or I keep expecting to see that happen.

280
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,430
Um,
and it's a little bit like my head is

281
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,240
this image of like,
imagine you have an urn right way and

282
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,790
you just keep pulling things out of it
and all you pull out of it as junk,

283
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,460
right?
You pull chicken bones and broken

284
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:36,940
marbles and gum and,
and it's,

285
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,920
it's still possible that you,
that if you root around in that earned

286
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,700
long enough,
you're going to find the hope diamond.

287
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:45,610
I mean,
in each round that you pull something

288
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:49,000
out that really has no logical
implication for the next thing you might

289
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:52,270
pull out of a the earn.
But mines aren't like that when I see

290
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:56,590
what this guy says,
he does not say anything that a well

291
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,960
informed,
intelligent person would say.

292
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,270
And it's just an ideas are connected,
right?

293
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,190
So you can't,
um,

294
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,160
you can't fake this stuff.
You can't,

295
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,050
you can't fake being this,
this uninformed and you can't fake being

296
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,530
really well informed and he's just,
I mean,

297
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:16,320
we just look at one policy that he wants
the,

298
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,410
the,
the um,

299
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:18,910
uh,
you know,

300
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,420
the rounding up of illegal aliens,
right around 11 million illegal aliens.

301
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,460
Now this,
this gets stated as,

302
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,900
yeah,
we're going to round them up and send

303
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:27,710
them back to Mexico.
Um,

304
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,590
and what worries me is no one seems to
care about that.

305
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:35,050
If you just look at the implications of
doing this,

306
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,700
it has this one policy claim alone is so
impractical and unethical.

307
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,280
It's just what are we talking about
here?

308
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:47,460
You're talking about like your,
your gardener,

309
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,970
your housekeeper or the person that
works at the carwash,

310
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,530
the person who picks the that you buy in
the market is going to get a knock on

311
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:59,531
the door in the middle of the night by
the Gestapo and get sent back to.

312
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,340
The vast majority of these people are,
are,

313
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,970
are law abiding.
People are just working at jobs that

314
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,570
Americans by and large don't want to do.
And many of them have kids who were

315
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:12,170
American citizens,
right?

316
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:15,350
And somebody to say someone's got kids
under the age of 10 who are American

317
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:18,620
citizens and what you're going to send
that person back to Mexico and you're

318
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:21,770
going to do this by the hundreds of
thousands and millions.

319
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,310
It's just that one point alone held in
isolation from all of the other things.

320
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,400
He said.
The crazy things like climate change is

321
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:35,300
a hoax concocted by the Chinese to
destroy our manufacturing base.

322
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,500
And um,
you know,

323
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,140
the fact that he likes Putin,
I mean,

324
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,210
everything else he said,
write this one policy,

325
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:44,960
claim alone should be enough to
disqualify a person's candidacy.

326
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:48,020
It's so crazy with the moment you look
at it,

327
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,990
and yet no one seems to care.

328
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,010
In fact,
he is just,

329
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:55,520
it's just more energizing to the people
who already like him.

330
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,010
I know that he said that he wanted to
build a wall,

331
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:01,670
but I didn't know that he wanted to get
rid of the illegal aliens,

332
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:04,820
round them up and around them up and do
one with them,

333
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,390
send them back to their country is so
crazy.

334
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,670
That's such a crazy idea.
And it's so brutal.

335
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,170
The idea that,
I mean,

336
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,230
it's like a,
it's a sub human thing.

337
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,660
The only reason why people would come to
America as because they felt they felt

338
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:20,240
like it would make their life better.
So people take a big risk.

339
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:23,090
It's not an easy way to do it if you're
poor,

340
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,630
you don't have any qualifications for
any unusual job.

341
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,000
I mean,
you're trying to get across to Mexico,

342
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,640
but everybody who does it does it
because they want to improve their life,

343
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,920
you know,
and the idea that one group of people

344
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,560
shouldn't be able to do it in one group
should just because they were born in

345
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:41,561
the right side of some strange line that
is only a couple hundred years old.

346
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,050
But,
uh,

347
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,800
but I actually,
no,

348
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,430
I'll go further in meeting him in the
middle,

349
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,220
whereas I think we should be able to
defend our borders,

350
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:50,360
right?
So it is,

351
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,720
I don't have a good argument for having
a porous border that we can't figure out

352
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,010
how to defend and we don't know who's
coming into the country.

353
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,461
Right.
So,

354
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:02,960
so I think building the wall is almost
certainly a stupid idea among his many

355
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:06,980
stupid ideas,
but I think it would be great to know

356
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:11,510
who's coming in the country and have a,
a purely legal process by which that

357
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,290
happened.
I mean,

358
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,300
ultimately that's got to be the goal.
Right?

359
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,310
And we are,
we're in perfectly doing that.

360
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,550
And um,
so I don't have an argument for open

361
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:25,220
borders or porous borders,
but the question is,

362
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:30,221
what do you do with 11 or 12 million
people who are already here doing jobs

363
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,990
we want them to do that help our
society,

364
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,350
uh,
and the vast majority of them are law

365
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:39,380
abiding people who as you say,
or just trying to have better lives,

366
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,690
uh,
the idea that you're going to break up

367
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:46,040
families and send people back by the
millions and the idea that you're going

368
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,550
to devote your law enforcement resources
to doing this when you have real

369
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,910
terrorism and real crime to s to deal
with.

370
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,580
It's just pure insanity.
Right?

371
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,483
And,
and,

372
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:03,170
and also totally unethical and yet he
doesn't get any points docked for this

373
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,361
aspiration.
I mean,

374
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:08,370
it's just,
it's one of the things around which

375
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:12,360
people are rallying.
But the climate change thing is also

376
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:13,590
insane and dangerous.
Well,

377
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,450
he was a birther,
right?

378
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,200
Yeah,
right.

379
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,080
He was one of the original birthers.
He was saying that Obama's birth

380
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:22,440
certificate was bullshit.
He was born in Kenya,

381
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:23,760
right?
Wasn't he one of those guys?

382
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,990
Oh yeah,
he was,

383
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,940
he was,
um,

384
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,300
I would love it if funding that for a
while.

385
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,450
I would love to,
if he got into office and just said,

386
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:33,570
listen folks,
I am nothing like this person.

387
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:37,620
I pretended to be to win the presidency.
I just wanted to show you that you can

388
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:42,420
be manipulated and get it together.
Then at peaches punk to all.

389
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,470
So I'm going to hire some people who
actually know how to run things and

390
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:48,120
we'll say that's the,
the,

391
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,240
the smart people who are voting for him
think.

392
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,230
And this is,
I think an actual,

393
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,960
a crazy position.
But they,

394
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,040
they think that he is just pandering to
the idiots who he needs to pander to,

395
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,110
to get into office.
So He's,

396
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,430
he's not disavowing the white
supremacists votes,

397
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,370
you know,
with the,

398
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,810
the Alacrity that you would if you were
a decent human being and you found out

399
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,200
that David Duke supported you.
Um,

400
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,070
uh,
because he needs to.

401
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:19,780
He just,
he needs those votes and he knows that,

402
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,640
that most of the people in his base
aren't going to care and he can just

403
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,600
kind of move on in the news cycle.
Um,

404
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,730
and he's doing this on all these issues
where he looked where smart people see

405
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,430
that he looks like a buffoon and,
and they,

406
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:39,210
and they are treating him as a,
the people who don't like him or

407
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,260
treating him as a comic figure who he
can't really believe that stuff.

408
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,570
He's not really,
he's too sophisticated to really believe

409
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:46,920
that stuff.
So He's just pandering.

410
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,900
Um,
I mean,

411
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:52,530
one is people aren't seeing if that's
true,

412
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,050
just how unethical and weird that is
right here.

413
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:58,560
The guy has no compunction about lying
and demonizing people.

414
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,640
Like let's say he,
let's say he thinks that that Clinton

415
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:05,760
really isn't guilty,
but Bill Clinton isn't really guilty of,

416
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,200
of a rape.
Right?

417
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:08,730
And now he's calling him a rapist.
Right now.

418
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:12,690
At the time he was saying he wasn't a
rapist and he's just being defamed.

419
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:13,980
And this is outrageous.
He was taking,

420
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,680
he was taking the side of a friend who,
you know,

421
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,230
he invited to his wedding,
but now he's,

422
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,950
he's calling him a rapist,
right?

423
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:23,790
In a sexual Predator who's,
who've harmed women's rights more than

424
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,040
anyone.
I'm so,

425
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:26,910
which is true,
right?

426
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:27,780
So,
so there's,

427
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,810
there's no version of the truth here
that makes trump look at all acceptable

428
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,020
as a person.

429
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,020
It's like either he knew he was a rapist
and was defending him because he was

430
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,700
just cozying up to power at that point.
Right.

431
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,380
Didn't care that he's a rapist or now
he,

432
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,730
he knows he's,
he's still the guy who thinks he wasn't

433
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:49,720
a rapist,
but now he just,

434
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:52,630
for purely opportunistic reasons,
he's,

435
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,850
he's,
he's willing to call a guy a rapist who

436
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:56,670
he knows isn't,
um,

437
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,180
they're both horrible.
Right?

438
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,110
And it's not like there's new evidence
has come forward in the intervening

439
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,280
years that would have changed his mind
about what happened in,

440
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,380
in Clinton's presidency.
So He's,

441
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:10,000
um,
uh,

442
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:15,180
but I think people think that he's got
to be much more sophisticated than he

443
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,730
is.
And that if he got into office,

444
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,750
he would just be a totally sober and
presidential person.

445
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,340
There's just no reason to believe that
it,

446
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,860
if he thinks climate change is a hoax
and that we should pull out of the Paris

447
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:31,960
accord,
then what your ramp up coal production

448
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,180
and we're going to bring back the coal
jobs.

449
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:35,200
I mean,
this is what he's saying,

450
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,510
right?
There's no reason to think he doesn't

451
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,110
believe this at this point.
Um,

452
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,350
that's just,
you know,

453
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,850
it is a disastrous thing for a president
to think.

454
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,410
The only,
um,

455
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,020
fascinating versions of this that I've
been hearing from people that I respect

456
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,720
are that the idea that he is like,

457
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,463
uh,

458
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,580
the political version of the asteroid
that killed the dinosaurs.

459
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,600
Like he's going to come down and smash
it and it's going to be so chaotic that

460
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:06,700
they're going to be forced to reform the
system.

461
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,210
And people are gonna respond in turn,
like the way people are responding

462
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:12,310
against factory farming and more people
are going Vegan,

463
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,050
like that kind of a thing.
They're going to see it and they gonna

464
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:17,110
respond in turn.
That is such a.

465
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,380
So it's like he's going to toss the
apple cart up in the air,

466
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,590
he's just going to fuck this whole goofy
system up and then we'll be able to

467
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:26,140
rebuild after trump has dismantled all
the,

468
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,290
all the different special interest
groups and lobbyists and all the people

469
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,600
that we really would like to get out of
the system.

470
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,480
We really don't like the.
The fact that they're such insane

471
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:39,430
amounts of influence that big
corporations and lobbyists have had on

472
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:39,670
the way.

473
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,610
Laws get passed that.
This might be the way to do it.

474
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,160
You have some wild man.
Everyone's fired.

475
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:47,410
You have fired.
You have fire Jetson.

476
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,690
It's like a character like he's coming
in.

477
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:53,200
His hair's plastic is all fired up.
He's a billionaire.

478
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:55,690
He made all his own money,
sort of dad gave him some money,

479
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:58,690
but you turned it into a lot of money.
Point being he doesn't need anybody's

480
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:00,070
money.
The truth is probably lying about the

481
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:04,240
amount of money has he is,
but he's a baller for sure though,

482
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,650
right?
At the very least,

483
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,290
he's got to be worth some cash.
Yeah.

484
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,790
I made.
It could be a big difference between

485
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,620
what he's claiming and what is in fact
true,

486
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:14,590
but he's,
he's a many

487
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,040
pieces here when people assume that
because he's a successful businessman,

488
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,290
he must understand the economy,
right?

489
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,630
Which is no necessary connection there,
right?

490
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,770
There's a lot of rich people who are
totally confused about economics and

491
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,760
you,
most economists don't have a lot of

492
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:32,920
money,
so there's no real connection there.

493
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,270
But the,
um,

494
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,483
the,
uh,

495
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,820
I mean,
so what you're describing is

496
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,240
I kind of just random like,
like you're just,

497
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,950
let's just,
let's just smash the window and then see

498
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:46,130
what

499
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,910
happens,
right?

500
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,880
What I'm going to light a fire to this,
this place and,

501
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,480
and see what happens.
And that's um,

502
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,270
it almost any process by which you would
change the system is more intelligent

503
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,270
than that,
you know,

504
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,200
and,
and it's also not value in how much harm

505
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,990
one bad president could do,
right?

506
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,930
Like there's no,
I think even,

507
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,410
I haven't tested this,
but I'm imagining that even trump

508
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:15,770
supporters would answer this question
the way I would hope,

509
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,880
which is like if,
if I had a crystal ball that could tell

510
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:21,220
you,
we can't tell you who's going to be

511
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:24,560
president,
but it tells you how it works out for

512
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,210
the next president.
So like if I,

513
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,300
if I look in the crystal ball and it
says the next president of United States

514
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
is a disaster,
right?

515
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:33,230
Just,
it's like the worst president we've ever

516
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:35,150
had.
It just think of,

517
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,590
you know,
just just failures of governance and,

518
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,130
and the toxic influence of narcissism
and Hubris that comes along just like

519
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,880
once every thousand years.

520
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,390
Right.
Just,

521
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,570
just disaster.
I think,

522
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:52,910
you know,
even if you're a trump supporter,

523
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,050
which candidate that was like only trump
is,

524
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,700
is likely to screw things up that badly.
It's not.

525
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,130
Clinton is going to,
is going to be almost perfectly

526
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:06,440
predictable.
She's going to be a politician,

527
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,590
she's gonna.
She's going to be basically centrist on

528
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,560
a lot of the,
on foreign policy and domestic policy.

529
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:14,990
You know,
she's going to be liberal on social

530
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,220
issues,
um,

531
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,720
she is not going to
try to dismantle NATO and to get into a

532
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:29,080
war with North Korea or get into an
alliance with Putin or image.

533
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,520
There's,
she's not going to do something insane.

534
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,240
Um,
and so alliance with Putin.

535
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,450
Yeah.
He said basically only favorable things

536
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:39,650
about Putin.
They're homeless.

537
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,030
They're tight,
so she get get.

538
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,941
Uh,
hopefully we'll,

539
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:48,850
we'll see pictures with both of them on
horseback shirtless and out of the red

540
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,680
shirt on.
He'll probably keep your shirt on.

541
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,980
I don't see them as being the shirtless
guy.

542
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,660
I know.
Yeah.

543
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,730
When,
when you just look at the landscape

544
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,200
between Bernie and Hillary in him and
uh,

545
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,560
you know,
to me it looks like the last gasps of a

546
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:11,120
dying system.
So.

547
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,750
But that's representative government
system for that is a lot of people are

548
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,770
saying that things like that,
but they're not hearing just how

549
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,940
nihilistic that is if.
True.

550
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,670
Right.
It's like there's so much stuff we have

551
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:33,460
to get right and there's so much.
And the only tool to get it right is,

552
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,420
is having your,
your mind actually understand what's

553
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:42,200
going on in the world and how to
manipulate the world in the direction

554
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:46,350
you want it to go.
So you have to understand like what,

555
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:50,850
whether or not climate change is true,
your beliefs about it have to be

556
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,250
representative of that truth,
right?

557
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,850
So like let's say,
you know,

558
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,570
let's say it's,
let's say I'm mistaken and there's,

559
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:59,970
you know,
there is no human caused climate change

560
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:00,810
is not a problem.

561
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,350
And every moment spent thinking about
it,

562
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:08,340
worrying about it,
correcting for it is just a waste of

563
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:11,100
time.
That's just throwing out the wealth of

564
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:11,934
the world,
right?

565
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,090
Um,
that would be a terrible thing,

566
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,590
right?
So it really matters who's right about

567
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:21,120
that and the fact that we have a
president or a candidate who is coming

568
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:24,480
in saying,
this is all bullshit,

569
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,500
you know,
in,

570
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,500
in defiance of all of the science is,
uh,

571
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,350
and it's true,
but it's on every other problem.

572
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,310
He doesn't know anything about it.
I guarantee you he doesn't know the

573
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:42,900
difference between Sunni and Shia Islam
or which countries are Sunni

574
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:44,820
predominantly in which are Shia
predominantly,

575
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:47,040
and I mean,
I'm sure he's going to do.

576
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,900
I don't know what he's going to cram for
this final exam.

577
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:52,410
I'm sure before one of those debates
he's going to get someone's gonna sit

578
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:55,650
down with him and give him some bullet
points he's got to have in his head,

579
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:58,770
but his head is just not in this game.

580
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,700
It's never been in this game.
It's obvious from everything he says and

581
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,580
that's what that is.
Something you can't say about Clinton,

582
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,560
right?
For all of her flaws as a person,

583
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,330
I don't care how much you hate her as a
person.

584
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,050
She understands what's going on in the
world and that's.

585
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,000
That difference is so enormous.
Forget about all the other character

586
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:21,420
flaws of this guy who is just obviously
going to.

587
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,763
I mean he,
he's,

588
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,330
but are we attached to much to this idea
of one person being the figurehead?

589
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,900
We figure it out.
Someone has to be the decider.

590
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,130
If we all woke up today,
if everybody woke up and there was just

591
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,450
no government,
there was nothing more.

592
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:37,560
I'll just.
What happened?

593
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:39,510
I don't know,
but we've got to figure out how to run

594
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:40,261
this thing.
Well,

595
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,360
we had no,
no previous understanding of government.

596
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,420
Would you think anybody would say,
we need one dude to just run this whole

597
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,970
giant continent filled with 300 million
people?

598
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,530
Most likely if we woke up and we had
technology like we have today,

599
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,800
we have the ability to communicate like
we have today with social media and

600
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,670
whatever.
We would probably say we need to like

601
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,470
figure this out amongst each other and
find the people that have the most

602
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,490
qualified for each one of these
positions and start running our

603
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:08,070
government that way.
Well that that's what we're attempting

604
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:09,480
to do,
but it's just,

605
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,670
and I totally agree with you that it is
astonishing that out of a nation of 300

606
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,280
million people,
these are the choices you would think

607
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,950
you would think it'd be starting from
your basic,

608
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,720
you know,
your zero set point of just,

609
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:24,120
you know,
now we're going to reboot civilization.

610
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,690
Um,
you would think that if you had this

611
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:32,610
kind of process,
each candidate would be more impressive

612
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,350
than the next.

613
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,840
I,
you,

614
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,880
you'd be like,
I can't believe each,

615
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,490
each person who came to the podium like
James.

616
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,620
So yeah,
it'd be like,

617
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,600
it'd be like the dunk contest for the
NBA.

618
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:43,720
I'd be like,
oh my God,

619
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,070
I could just,
when you thought you saw the best dunk

620
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:47,861
in your life,
you know,

621
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:50,950
the next guy comes along and it would be
that.

622
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,360
It would be that on every topic,
right?

623
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,920
It'd be like you'd be talking about the
science of climate change.

624
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:00,730
It'll be talking about the,
the actual dynamics of the war on

625
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:03,050
terror.
You to topics that,

626
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,250
that seem to have no relationship where
you would have to be.

627
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,310
You'd be amazed that anyone could be an
expert in all of them.

628
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,120
You would find someone who is an expert,
a functional expert in all of them.

629
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,260
Agility,
winter dude.

630
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

631
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,520
But,
and,

632
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,690
but someone who is also ethically wise
who wasn't just wasn't obviously an

633
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:20,524
asshole.

634
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,490
And who,
who,

635
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,680
who had a,
a mature relationship to changing his or

636
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:33,160
her mind.
Right.

637
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:36,870
So like the whole bit about flip
flopping and not,

638
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,870
you know,
being someone who could honestly

639
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:45,130
represent changes of mind in,
across a political career.

640
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,500
Right.
This is nowhere written.

641
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:51,430
That is a good thing to believe today,
what you believe 20 years ago.

642
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:53,080
In fact that they do that on every
topic.

643
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:55,600
It means basically you haven't been in
dialogue with the world,

644
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,730
but there's something,
it's so taboo to change your mind that

645
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:03,610
either you have to lie about it or you
have to pretend it was a,

646
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,860
it was always that way or it's just a,
a,

647
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,200
I'm an assistant.
Yet the system is,

648
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,130
is broken in that respect.
But given the choices,

649
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,200
you know,
and when you have a choice between

650
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:22,201
someone who is for all her flaws,
been in the game for long enough to be

651
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:28,420
really well informed and capable of
compromise and capable of,

652
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,100
uh,
not just just,

653
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,400
um,
breaking,

654
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,360
um,
the entire machine.

655
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,760
Um,
and you have someone who's just,

656
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:44,790
he could just kind of stepped off the
set of his reality TV show and then lied

657
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,630
about everything and,
and elbowed his way onto your television

658
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:52,250
set and never left because,
you know,

659
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,600
CNN couldn't figure out how to give the
mic to someone else.

660
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,120
Um,
it's a,

661
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,050
it's amazing.

662
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,630
Well,
he's a product of attention because they

663
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:04,320
realize that there's the heated race,
right?

664
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,730
The heated race.
This guy was really famous and in a

665
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:09,460
heated race,
this guy would say some crazy stuff and

666
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,980
so they would tune into them so
everybody had to do an intro.

667
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:13,780
So I,
because of him saying crazy stuff,

668
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,210
he accelerated the amount they were
talking about them.

669
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:19,630
So they're constantly talking about him
and barely talking about other people.

670
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,493
And.

671
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,330
But he's created a worm hole in our
political process now where there's

672
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:28,700
nothing so crazy that could disqualify
him among the people who like him to.

673
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,730
So he can just keep it just like nuclear
bombs of craziness that the press can't

674
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,770
ignore that the,
every time they think,

675
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,000
okay,
this is the crazy.

676
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,180
He said that's going to harm his
candidacy,

677
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:45,290
so let's shine a light on it.
It just helps him know he could just,

678
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,011
he could,
you know,

679
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:47,450
he could.
He could get on twitter right now and

680
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:48,320
say,
you know who I'd like to.

681
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,570
I'd like Nicki Minaj and,
and it would work for him.

682
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,430
It would work for them.
You would use a tweet storm of a billion

683
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:02,210
people who say,
I'd like to fuck Nikki Minaj to go get

684
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:05,130
her,
and it's insanity.

685
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,300
That's where we are.
But in a sense,

686
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,480
if w w we,
we do admit that this is a fucked up

687
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:13,890
system.
It's not ideal.

688
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,590
It should definitely be reworked and
it's so hard to rework.

689
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,150
Wouldn't the best way to rework it?
A trump asteroid just slams right into

690
00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:22,980
the White House.
Boom.

691
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:27,810
Blows the whole thing sky high.
Who knows what terrible things have to

692
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:30,480
happen,
but maybe that would be enough.

693
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,800
The thing is we have those,

694
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,190
those asteroids are coming anyway.
So when you look at like nine slash 11

695
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:37,210
was an asteroid,
right?

696
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:39,600
So it's like a or,
or a superbug that,

697
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,410
that becomes a pandemic,
that these are things that are coming

698
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:49,930
and we need people who are in touch
with,

699
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,540
with reality to deal with them,
right?

700
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:56,080
So like the moment someone advertises
their,

701
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,470
not only their ignorance,
but the fact that they don't care that

702
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,200
they're ignorant and they do this again
and again,

703
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,220
they keep doubling down that person.
It's like if you put that person at the

704
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:10,180
helm,
what you have done is basically put

705
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,900
chaos at the hill,
right?

706
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:14,020
It's like this is,
this person's going to believe whatever

707
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:17,770
he believes,
regardless of the information coming in

708
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:20,320
and regardless of the consequences,
that's just,

709
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:21,300
I mean,
it's,

710
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,040
it's worse than having no one in charge.
I mean,

711
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:24,874
because you're,
you've,

712
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,180
you've put the power in this person's
hands,

713
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:28,330
right?

714
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,620
So this,
this person is,

715
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:34,621
everything has to go through this node
in the network that is just like an

716
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,940
information scrambling device,
right?

717
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:37,721
So like,
know how Matt,

718
00:34:37,721 --> 00:34:39,580
no matter how good the information is
coming in,

719
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,180
you have everything that you've got a
bottleneck here which just screws up the

720
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,014
signal,
right?

721
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,960
Um,
that's what you're doing if you're,

722
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,810
if you're,
if you're hiring someone like this,

723
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:52,180
who I'm,
I mean,

724
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:53,320
yeah,
in the best case,

725
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,490
you're what you stated earlier would in
fact be true,

726
00:34:57,491 --> 00:34:57,730
which,
uh,

727
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,920
he'll,
he'll get into the oval office and even

728
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:02,290
he will be scared about,
of the prospect that he is now

729
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,840
running the better part of human
civilization and he will hire the best

730
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:09,570
people or some semblance of the

731
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,690
people he can get access to and say,
tell me how to not screw this up.

732
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,930
And that will be a.
and then it'll,

733
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,910
then it'll essentially be business as
usual,

734
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,100
right?
In so far as you've hired,

735
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:26,030
the best people will be people.
People who are are deeply in this game

736
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:26,864
already,
right?

737
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,880
You know,
he'll defer to the generals when it

738
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,070
comes time to make war.
Being real.

739
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,660
Really pragmatic about how they pick
politicians and how they push certain

740
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:39,120
people and decide not to push others.
Do you think that something like trump

741
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:41,850
completely changes how they move
forward?

742
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,050
Now they realize that this can happen.
Like now that you see that people are so

743
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:49,860
goofy were so wwe eat out that you can
get this guy,

744
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,270
you know,
this is,

745
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,610
this is where we're at.
We've got a guys.

746
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,430
I told them the wall just got 10 foot
higher.

747
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,260
Yeah.
Everybody gets crazy.

748
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:02,340
Like how could you say that?
Once they realize that that's possible.

749
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,550
How long before you get like some
motivational speaker type dudes?

750
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,810
How long before they start jumping in
there?

751
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,320
Tony Robbins says,
well we,

752
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,510
that's what we have.
I mean,

753
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:11,830
this is.
Oh,

754
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,680
this is way worse than Tony Robbins for
president.

755
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:14,191
Oh yeah.
Way,

756
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:14,760
way,
way.

757
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,130
Tony Robbins positive dude.
Yeah.

758
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,910
Yeah,
but I'd vote for him.

759
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,380
You know,
Tony Robbins positive guy.

760
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:20,250
No,
that's not what it means,

761
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:26,090
but that sort of ability to excite
people to get like one of those

762
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,770
motivational speaker dudes like those
guys.

763
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,270
Whereas a lot of yoga pants and he's
going to,

764
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,160
he's going to be the next president is
going to get us in shape

765
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,280
to be a reality show.
America is a reality show where there

766
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,050
were awesome.
We're the best.

767
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,120
Did you see this press conference he
held?

768
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,700
I think it was yesterday,
no,

769
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,870
I did not know.
There was a very funny moment where the,

770
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,460
there was one journalist,
I didn't recognize who it was,

771
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,863
who gets hooked,
so,

772
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,880
so trump was being very combative with
the press pool and he was,

773
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,110
he was basically,
you know,

774
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:02,510
shouting them down,
not answering any of the questions and

775
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,280
one journalist,
just a gas said,

776
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,800
is this what is going to be like when
you're president and is this,

777
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:11,120
how is this going to be like to be in
the White House press corps and deal

778
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:13,130
with you?
And uh,

779
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,133
and he said,
yes,

780
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,900
this is exactly what's gonna be like.
And,

781
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,270
but you,
you could just see that like the

782
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,690
journalists,
like they,

783
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:22,030
they,
they turn the camera on the room of

784
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,040
journalists and they like,
they are astonished by what is happening

785
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:29,000
here.

786
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,790
Like they don't know they're
participating in this process and in

787
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,540
some sense they've created this process.
Um,

788
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,863
but,
uh,

789
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,263
no,
not all of you.

790
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,310
Many of you are enough of us.
Is this what you do?

791
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,400
Is it,
is this what it's going to be covering

792
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:45,710
you if your president?
Yeah,

793
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,490
let,
let me tell you to have this kind of

794
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,960
take charge in the restroom.
Okay.

795
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:50,370
Yeah.
It is gonna to be like this David.

796
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:55,320
If the press writes false stores like
they did with this because you know,

797
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:57,900
probably half of you are amazed that I
raised all this money.

798
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,270
If the press writes fault like they did
where I wanted to keep a low profile.

799
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:05,610
I didn't want the credit for raising all
this money for the vets.

800
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,850
I wasn't looking for the credit and by
the way more money is coming in.

801
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,110
I wasn't looking for the credit but I
had no choice but to do this because the

802
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:15,240
press was saying I didn't raise any
money for them.

803
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,200
Not only that are raised it much of it
was given a long time ago and there is a

804
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,210
vetting process and I think you
understand that,

805
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,290
but when I raised almost $6,000,000 and
probably in the end were raised more

806
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:28,110
than six because more is going to come
in and is coming in.

807
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,230
But when I raised five point 6 million
as of today,

808
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,350
more is coming in and I.
and,

809
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:36,130
and this is going to phenomenal groups
and have many

810
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,480
of these people vetting the people that
are getting the money and work you play

811
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:41,920
at the moment I was referring to

812
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,400
say here is a case where he's probably
almost certainly line about his history

813
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:54,310
of giving to veterans affairs and says
he gave money very recently after people

814
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:57,910
started fishing around to see if he
actually had given the money that he

815
00:38:57,911 --> 00:38:59,590
claimed were given to,
to veterans.

816
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,380
Um,
but,

817
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,330
uh,
I mean this is.

818
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,770
What's difficult about this is that,
I mean the PR,

819
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,800
yes there are the press is highly
imperfect and there and also partisan

820
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:19,300
and there are false stories and there
are exaggerations and they screw people

821
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:20,140
over.
Yes.

822
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,650
And there are reasons to
not trust the press from time to time,

823
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,790
but the,
in this case you have a,

824
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,670
someone who the,
there is no amount of fact checking and

825
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,430
discuss information of his statements
that,

826
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:47,000
that forces him to ever acknowledge
anything that he's done wrong and the,

827
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,240
and the lack of acknowledgement to.

828
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,480
He pays no price for it among,
among the people who like him.

829
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,590
And so the press is powerless and then,
and then,

830
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,050
but the net result of like a,
of a press conference like this,

831
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:04,051
if you're a trump follower,
is he just showed how a biased and and

832
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,320
petty the press pool is.
Um,

833
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,490
and the press do need to just be beaten
up by a strong man who,

834
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,870
who's not gonna stand for their
bullshit.

835
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,730
Uh,
but it's a,

836
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,070
it's a,
um,

837
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,070
I mean if you,
it's unbecoming the very least,

838
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,790
that kind of communication.
It's kind of unbecoming that person that

839
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:27,460
we expect.
And that's pretty mild compared to his,

840
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,930
you know,
his parody of the,

841
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,890
of the,
um,

842
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:35,550
the disabled reporter who he saw that
bit where he did like a,

843
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,023
a,
um,

844
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,690
a cerebral palsy imitation at,
at one of his speeches.

845
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,651
He was the.
Yeah.

846
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:42,150
Oh yeah,
yeah.

847
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,440
He was interviewed by,
I don't happen to know who the.

848
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,520
And it was.
Roberto was.

849
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,341
Oh,
he was making.

850
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:48,680
He was making fun of somebody with
cerebral palsy.

851
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,240
I mean,
he's done so many

852
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,790
things that you could,
that you would think would be

853
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,720
fundamentally canceling of a person's
political aspirations.

854
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,390
Like you,
you can't even cut Marco Rubio

855
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,970
pretending to be like a just

856
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:08,050
goofy on someone's cerebral palsy
added at one of his campaign events.

857
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,190
Oh,
right.

858
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,660
One of the things that Ted Cruz was just
that video of him with his family.

859
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:17,510
The outtakes where they read into that.
Oh,

860
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:18,344
you didn't see it?
No,

861
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,660
it's a gem.
It's spectacular.

862
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:25,160
It's him with his mom and he's like,
my mom prays for me often for hours

863
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,330
every day,
and she was like,

864
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,970
she looks at him like,
what the fuck for hours every day.

865
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,900
No,
I don't.

866
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,220
He can't even say that.
And so they have all these really

867
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:35,210
awkward moments.
Like,

868
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,740
okay,
I'm going to go in for a hug.

869
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,700
I'm going to say I love you.

870
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,760
It's all like weirdly mapped out and
that got online and people were like,

871
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:44,780
Oh,
Christ,

872
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,750
okay.
See this is,

873
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,180
this is a bad game.
Like you're not even good at this game.

874
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,040
This is you.
You're terrible at this game.

875
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,230
Yeah.
He was objective really terrible.

876
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,233
Well,
that's his,

877
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,980
that's trumped competition.
Well,

878
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:00,230
the thing that we'll think about cruise
that never even got out,

879
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,290
which was the reason to be scared about
a Cruz presidency,

880
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:06,170
was his level of religious craziness.
I mean,

881
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:09,860
no one was even pushing on that because
there was just enough to push on before

882
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,470
he even got to that door and you have to
hold onto those weapons.

883
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,813
But I mean,
it hadn't been.

884
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:18,590
Had crews been the nominee,
it would have been all about religion.

885
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,680
What's,
what's odd is that that's not a handicap

886
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,480
in 2016 that you can have that and
people consider it an asset.

887
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,780
Well,
the one thing that's

888
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:32,890
pricing and actually hopeful in trump's
candidacy is the fact that he has,

889
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:39,580
he has dissected out the religious,
social conservative component of,

890
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,640
of the Republican Party.
So like evangelicals,

891
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:47,210
for the most part,
we're going for trump over crews when it

892
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:52,211
was pretty clear to them that trump was
just pretending to be religious and

893
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:54,240
Minnesota.
So trump gave one speech at,

894
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,530
I think Liberty University where he
spoke.

895
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:59,930
He said Corinthians two,
um,

896
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,750
and you know,
that's not the way any bible reader

897
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:05,810
would,
would speak about a second Corinthians.

898
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,790
How would you say it?
Second Corinthians,

899
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,140
that's how you'd say it.
Yeah.

900
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,011
Yeah.
And so,

901
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:11,400
so he,
so he said Corinthians two,

902
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,290
it's as though this is something he just
opened every,

903
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,440
every night before you went to sleep.
And so it is clear that it was clear to

904
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:23,750
them that he's,
that he is just,

905
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,380
just miming the language,
you know,

906
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:31,520
or,
or I'm impersonating a person of faith

907
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,580
and um,
but they don't care really as long as he

908
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:37,400
does it.

909
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,630
And that's,
that is,

910
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,220
you know,
if you're gonna look for a silver lining

911
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:41,390
to this,
it,

912
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,870
it shows that it's not,
it's they just want a space where their

913
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:52,661
religious convictions are not under
attack and they don't really care that

914
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:57,290
the person in charge share them.
Just if you pretend to share them,

915
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,210
that's good enough.
And that's,

916
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,150
um,
that's better than actually carrying

917
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,220
that.
This person really believe in the

918
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:07,850
rapture or anything else that is quite
obviously crazy.

919
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,040
Um,
but,

920
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:10,581
uh,
yeah,

921
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,640
so I don't think any Christian who
voting for trump thinks,

922
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,420
I mean they'll say I'm not going to
judge another man's faith,

923
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,190
right?
Or I'm not.

924
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,970
Who am I to say what's really in his
heart,

925
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,781
right?
They'll say that,

926
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:23,770
but he's just given.
If you,

927
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,980
if you've been paying attention to who
he's been and,

928
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,970
and if you just look at how he talks
about these things,

929
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,450
I don't think he's any,
any Christian that it.

930
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,300
So I think they're willing to vote for
someone for it now,

931
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:41,070
for other reasons that are fairly
depressing in their own right.

932
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,870
They're willing to vote for someone
who's,

933
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,470
who doesn't really play the game the way
they do.

934
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,060
You have to believe in God to be
president in 2016.

935
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:54,601
Right?
Wouldn't you?

936
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:56,640
Wouldn't you say that?
That has to pretend to believe in God.

937
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,060
But I think with trump,
I think it,

938
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:05,090
I think the pretense is,
is obvious enough that I don't think

939
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:09,150
he's fooling the better part of the,
of the people who were voting for him,

940
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:09,901
who,
who would,

941
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:13,680
who would say they care about a person
of faith being in the White House.

942
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,000
So I,
if anything,

943
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:19,620
he might be in one thing.
He might be breaking the barrier on

944
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:22,410
having an atheist president because I
think he,

945
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,080
it's just nobody.
Nobody thinks he is a person of faith.

946
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,980
I don't think anyone really thinks that.
So he's perfect.

947
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:33,600
He's made.
It might be our first atheist president

948
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,760
who would help us in that,
in that regard as well.

949
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:37,860
Another trump media right into the White
House.

950
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:38,910
You,
I'm starting to sound like a trump

951
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:39,360
supporter.

952
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,310
Occasionally an asteroid does something
good.

953
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,280
Who would be the ideal president?
I mean like what,

954
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,780
what kind of a person?
I mean,

955
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:48,060
it would probably be a person who
doesn't seek attention.

956
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,640
Probably be a person that they could be
that.

957
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:56,070
I mean
the process is even,

958
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:00,270
even an optimized process will be,
um,

959
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:06,340
we'll record.
It will require a sacrifice of what

960
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,680
ordinary people want,
most of the time that it will be an

961
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:13,480
unusual personality who has to get
promoted and you will,

962
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,160
you will be on some metric be,
I mean,

963
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,250
it's almost by definition,
narcissistic to think that you should be

964
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:21,084
in this role,
right?

965
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,980
Who are you to think that you should be
running a civilization at this moment in

966
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:27,150
human history?
Um,

967
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,230
and to,
for you to be on it,

968
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:31,920
for you to honestly stand at the podium
and say,

969
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,870
I'm the guy or the woman,
I am the most qualified.

970
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,340
I should be doing this.
Right?

971
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,240
I can help.
Um,

972
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,110
if you,
if you're going to scrutinize the kind

973
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:46,200
of personality that could give rise to
those opinions,

974
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,180
it's not you.
Yeah,

975
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,640
there's,
there are some dials you would probably

976
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,100
want to change,
tweak if you,

977
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,430
if you had to be married to this person
or if it's not an optimal personality.

978
00:46:56,431 --> 00:47:01,431
So there's going to be kind of pathology
of power seeking that might be just

979
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:03,900
intrinsic to it.
But

980
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,940
you want someone who is actually wise
ethically.

981
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,970
I mean,
just,

982
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,400
just,
you're just trying to map that onto

983
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:12,340
trump,
right?

984
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Just,
he's imagined someone saying thing I

985
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:20,040
like about trump is that he is so deeply
ethical and wise.

986
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,110
Right?
It's just,

987
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,960
it does not.
I mean,

988
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,890
it's like saying it's because his hair
looks so natural.

989
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,310
Yeah.
I mean there's just no,

990
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:31,980
um,
it is,

991
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,060
is the antithesis of what he is.

992
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,340
Right.
Um,

993
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,050
the thing I like about trump is that he
is so well informed about the way the

994
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:42,620
world works,
um,

995
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,800
and where he's not informed.
He recognizes his ignorance so quickly

996
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:50,800
and he remedies that as fast as
possible.

997
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,510
He,
he,

998
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,460
he seeks out the best experts,
defers to them.

999
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,550
Um,
and uh,

1000
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,750
you know,
he's just,

1001
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,810
he's mindful of the limits of his
knowledge.

1002
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,080
Seo As,
as he is about his expertise and his

1003
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:06,640
expertise is vast.
Right.

1004
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,520
You'd want to be able to say that about
a president.

1005
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,830
You could not begin to say that about
trump.

1006
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,300
Right?
Um,

1007
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,450
you could probably say that honestly.
You could probably say that about

1008
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:17,300
Clinton,
right?

1009
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,930
Like for Hillary,
for all her defects,

1010
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,410
she's very knowledgeable and I'm sure
she will just try it.

1011
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,270
Where she,
where she doesn't feel like she's got

1012
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,110
the knowledge he's going to try to go
to,

1013
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,480
go to the source of the knowledge.

1014
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,270
Right.
Just grab the best experts you can find.

1015
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,820
Um,
I think she,

1016
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,940
I think she will be as aware as you are.
I would be of the consequences of not

1017
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:44,110
knowing what's going on.
Right?

1018
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:46,180
She's just going to want to find out
what's going on.

1019
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:49,960
Whereas this,
I mean all trump has advertised about

1020
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:54,961
himself is that he thinks that bluster
and banality and bullying will win in

1021
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:00,610
every situation.
It's just like,

1022
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,810
it's just attitude.
He's the guy is the guy is winging it

1023
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:10,470
and it could not be more obvious that
this guy is winging it on every level.

1024
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:11,350
I mean,
it's like it's just,

1025
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,100
it is,
it is

1026
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,380
not there.
There'd be no way for him to signal the

1027
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:21,850
fact that he's winging it more clearly
than he is with everything he's doing.

1028
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:23,830
And,
and yet there's no penalty.

1029
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,490
Do you think it's possible that in this
age of information,

1030
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,370
the way we can communicate with each
other that we're going to experience

1031
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:32,500
these cycles,
these waves,

1032
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:37,530
these in and outs,
these high and low tides of really smart

1033
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:42,960
presidents and really stupid president
and we just people revolt and there's

1034
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,490
just.
It's so easy to stay alive is plenty of

1035
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:48,550
students who fill out there and so
they're only willing to vote for other

1036
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:50,890
dme folks,
so the other dme folks get into

1037
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,950
position.
They send out the frequency that only

1038
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,990
the dummies here and everybody else is
going,

1039
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:59,590
what the fuck is everybody voting for
this guy for what is happening,

1040
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,060
and then it makes the smart people
rebound and for years and challenge

1041
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:08,170
themselves a new because they.
They need some sort of an enemy to rally

1042
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:12,880
against to reach their full potential
and that without the low tide you cannot

1043
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:16,690
have the high tide Sam Harris.
That's hopefully.

1044
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:20,950
That's not an analogy that applies to
the maintenance of civilization.

1045
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,750
The smell.
Yeah.

1046
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,160
The time man.
Maybe at the very least it's a wakeup

1047
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,690
call for the establishment.
This silly game that you've been running

1048
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:32,060
have two candidates,
just doesn't work.

1049
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,880
Someone can cooperate your candidacy,
get in there,

1050
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,610
throw the fucking monkey wrench into the
gear system,

1051
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:39,500
and guess what?
Trump's running for president now.

1052
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:40,610
He's the.
He's the head,

1053
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,120
he's the head guy for the Republicans.
How is that even possible?

1054
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:46,270
They don't know.
I met with amazing.

1055
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,890
It is a way,
if nothing else,

1056
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:49,840
it has a total wakeup call for the
Republicans.

1057
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,990
I mean they are just,
it's June aghast.

1058
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:52,400
Yeah,

1059
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,580
it's June.
Everything's decided locked down.

1060
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,040
So we have July,
August,

1061
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,510
September,
October,

1062
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:01,550
November.
We're that close.

1063
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:08,650
But he's not someone who has been.
Who is aligned with the Republican

1064
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:13,160
platform in most ways.
Right.

1065
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:18,161
So it's like he's been.
Truth is virtually no one knows what his

1066
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:22,490
policies are because he,
he keeps changing his position on things

1067
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:24,470
like taxation.
It's like if there actually is no keys.

1068
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:27,350
He said he's talked to on both sides of,
of,

1069
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,020
of core issue,
core Republican issues.

1070
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:32,380
But
I mean,

1071
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,600
in many ways he's left of Hillary,
right?

1072
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,530
He's,
you know,

1073
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:39,860
he's left of Hillary in terms of being
an isolationist.

1074
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:40,690
Like he's,
you know,

1075
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,230
he,
his,

1076
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,320
his relationship to war is,
but both extremes.

1077
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:48,194
Like,
he's like,

1078
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,550
no,
we're just going to,

1079
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,070
we're going to get out of the world's
business,

1080
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,450
right?
We're going to be isolationists,

1081
00:51:53,451 --> 00:51:56,670
which is deeply anti Republican.
Um,

1082
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,710
but I'm going to be the maniac who
you're never going to know who I'm going

1083
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:01,460
to bomb next.

1084
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,050
We're going to keep.
We're going to wipe out isis.

1085
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:04,430
We're just straight away,
right?

1086
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:06,470
Did Not,
not a man left standing.

1087
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,160
Um,
and I'm not gonna take any shit from

1088
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:13,490
anyone including China and North Korea.
And so he's that.

1089
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:17,600
But we're going to pull back in a huge
way and not be in anyone's business,

1090
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,310
right?
He said both of those things.

1091
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,120
Um,
uh,

1092
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,940
it's,
it's way too interesting way.

1093
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:32,390
We don't want politics to be this
interesting and it's going to be

1094
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:37,220
November is going to be,
if the polls are closed and watching

1095
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,460
those debates and,
and,

1096
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:39,530
and,
and,

1097
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,930
uh,
waiting for a swing in the polls,

1098
00:52:41,931 --> 00:52:43,370
as a result,
it's going to be,

1099
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,530
it's going to be way too interesting.
That's gonna be like watching the

1100
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,180
superbowl,
those first debates,

1101
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,910
you know,
it's going to be 100 million people

1102
00:52:49,911 --> 00:52:53,870
watching those debates.
I have a prediction.

1103
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,120
I think,
uh,

1104
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:02,370
I think it's entirely possible.
This whole thing was a plot that didn't

1105
00:53:02,371 --> 00:53:06,030
work out.
I think he probably came out of the gate

1106
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:10,890
saying crazy shit thinking he would tank
the Republican Party and get his friend

1107
00:53:10,891 --> 00:53:14,030
Hillary Clinton into the White House.
Did it.

1108
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,520
Well,
she didn't tend to work out.

1109
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,020
He kept trying to insult her,
kept trying to make stuff up about

1110
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:22,400
Mexicans and it just kept making them
get better and better and now he's

1111
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:23,234
stuck.

1112
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,970
He can't pull out.
That would be.

1113
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,100
That would be a great moment and that
would change the system.

1114
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,050
Well,
we're going to have to go through

1115
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:33,660
something like this in order for us to
realize that this is crazy,

1116
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:36,750
that a guy can just do this,
can just not really have any interest in

1117
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:39,960
politics.
Until then he should get the Nobel prize

1118
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:42,390
for everything.
If he pulls out at this point and says,

1119
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:45,090
listen,
I'm just took you to the precipice here,

1120
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,610
just because I wanted you to recognize
how unstable this situation is.

1121
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,660
I mean,
you,

1122
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:56,740
you guys could elect a demagogue who is
actually an incoherent demagogue.

1123
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,600
I'm not,
I haven't even been playing an

1124
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:02,520
incoherent authoritarian,
right?

1125
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:03,180
I'm,
I'm,

1126
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,620
I'm,
uh,

1127
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,730
on one hand,
a very liberal,

1128
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,010
right and tolerant.
And on the other hand,

1129
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:15,330
I'm like getting ready to be Hitler and
you guys can't figure out who I am and

1130
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:16,920
yet you're still prepared to vote for
me.

1131
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,140
I mean,
yeah,

1132
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,110
for him to do a postmortem on,
on his punking of,

1133
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:26,160
of the culture,
that would be the best thing to ever

1134
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:28,400
happen.
But I don't think that's,

1135
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,990
that's what's happening.
And we need someone like this.

1136
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,080
So the,
we realized how silly this whole thing

1137
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:34,741
is.
Do we need.

1138
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:35,520
Some are like,
no,

1139
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,690
we need a qualified person to deal with
all of the other hassles and dangers

1140
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:41,820
that are coming our way that have
nothing to do with,

1141
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,390
with what we do.
Like that person's not there.

1142
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:48,060
Even if we were doing everything
perfectly,

1143
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:54,290
they would still be this tsunami of risk
and hassle and

1144
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,230
waste and,
uh,

1145
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,100
just all the rest of the world chaos
that is coming our way.

1146
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:09,180
And it just forget even if we had our,
our house in order,

1147
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:14,181
in every respect,
we still have terrorism and the global

1148
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:15,450
climate change,
you know,

1149
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:17,550
you have,
you've got China and India and what are

1150
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:21,150
they doing in terms of complying with,
with,

1151
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,680
um,
climate goals?

1152
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,100
Uh,
you have all the things we've been

1153
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:29,780
talking about,
the virtual certainty that there's going

1154
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:32,040
to be a pandemic at the,
the not want to talking about

1155
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:34,710
bioterrorism.
We're talking about just the sheer fact

1156
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:39,090
that in 1919 there was a killer flu and
there's gonna be another killer.

1157
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:40,650
Flew right?
There's just no way.

1158
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:41,780
There's not going to be another killer
flu.

1159
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,720
Um,
and we need,

1160
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,570
we need people and we need people,
people to smart people to change the,

1161
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:53,370
to optimize the system,
to deal with these kinds of things.

1162
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:58,460
And if we're promoting religious maniacs
and,

1163
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,600
and crazy narcissists and uh,
liars,

1164
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:07,750
um,
and ignoramuses and only that,

1165
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,200
those people,
how could this end will know this is

1166
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,130
just a weird year for leg heavyweight
boxing,

1167
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,050
you know,
they have those weird years for Tony.

1168
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,260
And then were you were,
you could be the heavyweight champion of

1169
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:23,920
the world.
They went through a period of time

1170
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,020
in the early eighties for Tyson,
came around,

1171
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:28,510
was a series of like these champs that
were like,

1172
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,460
you know,
sort of like journeymen fighters.

1173
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,560
And then Tyson came along.
Maybe that's what it is,

1174
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:34,300
but only with only with heavy weights,
right?

1175
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,130
Yeah,
mostly with heavyweights.

1176
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:36,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

1177
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,620
And the lighter weights,
they were always bad ass.

1178
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,600
But I think that maybe that's what's
going on.

1179
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:45,310
Maybe we need to have this bad season,
get the season out of our way,

1180
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:48,790
realize the danger of having an inept
person in office,

1181
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:52,330
whether it's a liar or a dude who hates
money or,

1182
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:54,250
or,
or trump or whoever it is.

1183
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:58,090
Just go through it and realize how silly
it is that we have it set up this way

1184
00:56:58,091 --> 00:56:58,450
still.
