00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,420
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,580
Joe Rogan podcast.

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,800
Hello everybody.

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,281
Hello,

5
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:20,600
Philip DEFRANCO.

6
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:21,434
You're

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,001
welcome.

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:22,940
I don't know what that voice saw.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,440
Bob,

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,460
welcome to the show though.

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,440
Yeah,

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,910
it's just a fun day because
this is the first day of.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,310
You're listening to this in the future.

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,520
This is the day after the Seth Rogen
James Franco movie got pulled from all

15
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:41,041
theaters because of anonymous
threats from some hacker characters,

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,860
which is a pretty fucking weird,

17
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:45,400
Huh?

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:45,641
Yeah,

19
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:46,474
I mean it's,

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,040
it's rough sucker right up,

21
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:48,990
right up on my mouth.

22
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,520
That's what I like to say.

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,440
Living inside you.

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,970
It's A.

25
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,500
I mean it's,

26
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,041
it is rough.

27
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:54,461
There were a lot of.

28
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:56,020
I saw a lot of people
reacting yesterday like,

29
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:57,520
I can't believe America did this.

30
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:57,821
And I was like,

31
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:00,180
it's Sony is not in America.

32
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,120
They actually Japanese.

33
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,090
It's kind of Hilarious,

34
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,051
but yeah,

35
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:05,621
it is weird,

36
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:05,980
right?

37
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,970
Because I mean it does.

38
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:11,170
I mean it sets this like this precedent
that if you make something that we might

39
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:11,830
not want,

40
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,110
we can pressure you away from me.

41
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,000
Actually releasing it.

42
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,640
A defector says that North
Korea has 1800 cyber warriors.

43
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,313
What does that mean?

44
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,520
That means he has a whole clone of people
that will attack anybody that a clone.

45
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,950
I mean group of clubs.

46
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,450
The whole army army say,

47
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,550
yeah,

48
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,660
what the fuck man.

49
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:31,920
Yeah,

50
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
and it's weird,

51
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:33,101
right?

52
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:36,310
Because every time you see like a picture
of North Korea and like a person in

53
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:36,971
front of a computer,

54
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,950
it looks like they're just trying
to figure out how to use it.

55
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:39,731
They're like,

56
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:40,600
what is this?

57
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,201
Well,

58
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:45,140
obviously South Korea is responsible
for Samsung and you know,

59
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,270
so many incredible innovations
come out of South Korea.

60
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,680
I mean they,

61
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,480
they make some of the best
electronics in the world.

62
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,730
So I got to think that some of that
smarts gets up into North Korea.

63
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,740
It's going through that minefield.

64
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:00,574
It's able to get there.

65
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,050
I would imagine the state
steal people and are something.

66
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,921
They just hire him.

67
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:06,940
They just throw money at him.

68
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,260
Probably nobody's from South Korea is
going to go to North Korea because they'll

69
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,094
keep you there.

70
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,480
They'll do whatever the fuck they want.

71
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:13,691
I mean,

72
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:16,330
you hear that shit that they do
to those people in North Korea.

73
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,830
It's like the last,

74
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,701
at all,

75
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:23,060
those historical dictatorships that you,

76
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:26,830
you heard about like all throughout
time where people did horrific,

77
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,260
terrible things to the people that,

78
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,651
you know,

79
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,041
they were,

80
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,100
there were under the people
that were under their mother.

81
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,310
This is like the last one of those,

82
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,570
the last one that was a real dictatorship,

83
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,400
like one guy who really runs the
whole show and everyone's terrified.

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,301
Yeah.

85
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:46,390
And I thought there was like the
thought that he was actually going to be

86
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:49,540
knocked out of power and then it just
turned out he had a cold and he sprained

87
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,250
his ankle.

88
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:50,610
Yeah.

89
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,443
Who knows,

90
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,170
who knows what's going on over there.

91
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,430
But as a person who,

92
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,260
you do these youtube videos and
you started them essentially,

93
00:02:59,730 --> 00:02:59,980
did

94
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,920
you just sit in front of a
camera and just create your own?

95
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,680
Just.

96
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:03,921
Yeah,

97
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:04,401
I mean I was,

98
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,000
uh,

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,410
it was eight years ago.

100
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,711
Uh,

101
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:07,500
I was in,

102
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,360
I was in college,

103
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:08,900
uh,

104
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,280
I was going through the premed program.

105
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:12,110
I hated life and I had no money.

106
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:15,140
So Youtube was just like
this free entertainment
because I couldn't go out and

107
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:15,711
do anything.

108
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:19,580
And so I was watching these videos and
even to this day I think like when people

109
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:20,330
watch me,

110
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:20,810
it's like,

111
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,310
what is this schmuck talking about?

112
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,320
I could do this and I could
probably do it better.

113
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,530
And so that's what I felt eight years ago
and I just kinda started ranting about

114
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,730
bill o'reilly and then that
turned into more pop culture.

115
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,560
And then it turned into
like the eight minute show.

116
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,420
That thing that you did recently,

117
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,160
this is one that really got me,

118
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:38,420
is that Lena Dunham thing,

119
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,590
which,

120
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,071
which one?

121
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:41,210
I know they've talked
about it a few times.

122
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,410
Did you talk about a few times,

123
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:43,670
the one where you were,

124
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,350
you,

125
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:44,801
you,

126
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,870
you danced around it very well for
folks who don't know the story,

127
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,470
Lena Dunham wrote a book and in the
book she described this sexual encounter

128
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:57,950
that she had with a man where,

129
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,863
um,

130
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,950
it's tough to say exactly
what was going on,

131
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:05,951
but her description of it was
essentially that the guy was being very,

132
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,740
uh,

133
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,360
forward or,

134
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,960
you know,

135
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,261
very,

136
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:10,220
very pushy.

137
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,090
And she started talking
dirty to him out of.

138
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,480
I don't know how she described
that she just was out of fear.

139
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,390
Is that what she said or.

140
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,790
I'm trying to think of that specific one.

141
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,430
I know that I feel like one of
the last time she was in it,

142
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,750
there were people that were
accusing her of molesting

143
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,470
her sister.

144
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:26,890
Yes.

145
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,940
That's a different one.

146
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,170
Okay.

147
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,500
So definitely think that
when you're talking about.

148
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,720
This is the one where she.

149
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,680
She was saying that the guy raped her,

150
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,510
but she was talking dirty to the guy.

151
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,070
I don't think I covered that one.

152
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:36,191
Yeah,

153
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:36,740
you did.

154
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,960
I did say yeah,

155
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:42,490
you definitely question while you were
just saying that it was some mixed

156
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:47,491
signals that she was sending these crazy
mixed signals that it confuses people

157
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:50,500
as to what the definition,

158
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,940
the actual definition of rape.

159
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,750
Like what this,

160
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,783
this.

161
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,610
We're in a weird time now.

162
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,230
Okay.

163
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,700
And in this weird time that we're at,

164
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,830
there's a lot of,

165
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,350
there's a lot of exposure and a lot of
discussion about rape and I think that's

166
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:12,370
a very good thing because
obviously rape is it terrifying,

167
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,330
horrible crime.

168
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,770
I have three daughters,

169
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,211
you know,

170
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:16,300
it scares the shit out of me.

171
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,490
Um,

172
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:17,920
I just,

173
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,120
it just as a human being,

174
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,850
it's scares the shit out of me that
someone can do that to someone.

175
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,660
But this description which
she described in her book,

176
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,810
it doesn't sound like you
could call that rape to me.

177
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,141
I mean,

178
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:32,020
it sounds like an
unfortunate sexual encounter.

179
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,620
Her roommates convinced her
after the fact that it was rape,

180
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,311
you know,

181
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:37,120
the whole story.

182
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,350
She was telling her,

183
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,030
I can't believe you don't
remember what my videos.

184
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:40,990
I don't think I made this.

185
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,650
You must have.

186
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,190
No,

187
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,431
I mean,

188
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:43,171
it might've been sourced,

189
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:43,740
fed maybe.

190
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:43,921
No,

191
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:44,600
it was you dude.

192
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,110
Okay.

193
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,441
I'm gonna.

194
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:45,711
I'm gonna.

195
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:46,544
I'm gonna go after.

196
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,870
Do you find that you motherfucker.

197
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,231
Oh,

198
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:48,870
it's going to be that,

199
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,730
that got you moment.

200
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:50,061
I'll be like,

201
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:51,410
when did I make this video?

202
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,960
But either way,

203
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,910
um,

204
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,410
the,

205
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,410
the idea behind it is that she decided
after the fact that somehow or another

206
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,160
this was,

207
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,940
this was rape and then she
wrote this book about it.

208
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,650
And now the guy who,

209
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,730
you didn't talk about this,

210
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:15,731
but the guy who was the accused in this
has now lawyered up and even though he's

211
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:17,600
under a different name,

212
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:22,070
people have sort of identified who he
actually is and it's become this crazy

213
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:22,671
ugly thing.

214
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:27,671
And then it came out that she molested
her 12 year old sister for like a lot of

215
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,374
years.

216
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,333
Many years.

217
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:31,640
Yeah.

218
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:31,681
I,

219
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:31,801
no,

220
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:35,190
there was the story that she wrote in
the book and it was about her sister when

221
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:36,930
she was like one or two.

222
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:37,860
I think it was something like that.

223
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,130
And there was like the gravel
story and I mean that was,

224
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,993
that was weird.

225
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,770
The way that I like to cover it
is if it's not black and white,

226
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,450
which very few things are.

227
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:53,220
I try to talk about what both sides
say and then like where my mental

228
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,280
place is at that moment.

229
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:56,970
Um,

230
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,460
but I mean there's a lot
of conversation about,

231
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,510
about rape right now.

232
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:01,650
And I think I agree with you,

233
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,484
it is a,

234
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,480
it is very good.

235
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:05,850
Especially with all the
bill bill cosby stuff.

236
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,160
Yeah.

237
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,460
This was what it was.

238
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,580
It was real rape versus rape culture.

239
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,283
How long ago was that?

240
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,333
I don't know.

241
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,030
What did you just Google Philly.

242
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,240
The rape because this is weird now.

243
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:19,480
I might,

244
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,261
I might be wrong.

245
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:20,560
Dude,

246
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,140
I might be wrong and it actually might
have been somebody else into that video.

247
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,393
Sorry.

248
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,480
I was like,

249
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,901
oh no,

250
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:26,734
I haven't done.

251
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,520
Sorry.

252
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,360
You've done a few though,

253
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,720
right?

254
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,540
You've done a few on
her in this whole story.

255
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,480
I've talked about her in the book.

256
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:37,440
I've talked about a rape stories
recently just because it's.

257
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,430
There's just.

258
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,930
There is a real conversation to be had
and so many times it just gets lost on

259
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:47,340
the Internet whether it's some stupid
Hashtag that goes out there and had a good

260
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,640
intention and gets hijacked and then
it becomes just men versus women rather

261
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:52,050
than all of us against.

262
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,350
Right.

263
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,541
Oh,

264
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,780
it was steven crowder.

265
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:55,591
That's who it was.

266
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:56,160
I got you.

267
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,060
I got you confused,

268
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:57,931
but yeah,

269
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:59,580
all of us versus rapists.

270
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,150
Yeah.

271
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,520
This what is going on,

272
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:06,230
like why is like rape such
a hot topic right now?

273
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:10,950
Like do we go in cycles where things
become like important things to talk about

274
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,150
for whatever reason?

275
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,870
Like right now,

276
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,920
obviously it's race.

277
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,320
Race is a huge one now
because of Ferguson,

278
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:20,430
because of the guy that got killed
in New York or Eric Gardener.

279
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,600
We go in these weird cycles
like pop culture cycle.

280
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,221
Well,

281
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:29,930
I mean I think it's something hits and
then it is always a mishmash of think of

282
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,290
is it a real issue and people know
that they're going to get clicks.

283
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,000
You know,

284
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,180
it's just riding that wave.

285
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,720
I think a big part of it is riding
that wave but also like it's a problem.

286
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,730
I think when I talk to people,

287
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,620
a lot of it is,

288
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,100
you know,

289
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,690
I understand that I don't have that,

290
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,630
that mindset because of whether people
call it white privilege or just like my

291
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,710
specific specific way of being raised.

292
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,470
I don't have that outlook on life.

293
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:55,620
So I find it very interesting.

294
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:56,970
Yeah.

295
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,290
I,

296
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,180
I think especially now with,

297
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,420
uh,

298
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,320
with race,

299
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,480
with race and with a police
brutality like this is probably,

300
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,190
this subject has been brought up more
and not just obviously on youtube videos

301
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:15,150
but just all throughout social media over
the last couple months that I can ever

302
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:15,740
remember,

303
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,830
like in my lifetime.

304
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,740
I'm trying to think of other times.

305
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:20,574
I don't know,

306
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,540
race mean don't you think with all this,

307
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:24,780
uh,

308
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,400
Eric Garner stuff and all the stuff
that's going on right now with,

309
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:28,870
uh,

310
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,280
with,

311
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,800
with Ferguson and the police protest.

312
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,390
This is a strange time.

313
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:33,881
It is,

314
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:34,830
it's very strange time.

315
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,400
I um,

316
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,630
the,

317
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,940
the situation in New New York I think
perplex me the most just because uh,

318
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,940
I've been always just for the longest
time talking about body cams on cops and

319
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,480
it just like,

320
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,440
it has to be a thing.

321
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,030
But like everything else,

322
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,290
there's no one fix.

323
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,880
It's not like we throw
cameras on and it's like,

324
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,743
oh,

325
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,583
racism stopped.

326
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,590
But I do believe that it is a good first
step and I think then you do have to

327
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,410
punish officers that do not turn those on.

328
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,610
And I think that places that make it
where you can punish someone for filming a

329
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:08,050
police officer if you
into agonize the cop,

330
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:08,910
you know,

331
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,870
I think that's something.

332
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:10,980
But just filming,

333
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,690
like showing what happened.

334
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,750
Like that's crazy.

335
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,291
It's crazy.

336
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,880
And they just passed that
recently in one of the states,

337
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,793
Illinois,

338
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,131
I think it was.

339
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:18,270
Yeah.

340
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,140
Chicago is just insane.

341
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:20,351
I mean,

342
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:25,351
I dunno what the fuck they're trying
to accomplish by not having complete

343
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:26,770
transparency like that.

344
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,940
That's bizarre.

345
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,291
Right?

346
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:28,611
It just,

347
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:28,740
it,

348
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,880
you wonder like why.

349
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,421
I mean,

350
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,210
and there have been police officers that
come out saying the only people that

351
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:33,820
would be against

352
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,870
this are dirty cops.

353
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,810
Yeah.

354
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,870
Or people that just don't
want any more scrutiny.

355
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,990
Maybe they think that maybe
they think there's like,

356
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,990
especially with Chicago,

357
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:45,220
Chicago is so bad and the gang violence
in Chicago is so completely out of

358
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:45,731
control.

359
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:46,660
And you know,

360
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,730
you read about the
murder rates in Chicago,

361
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,050
they're off the charts.

362
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,770
Maybe there's think the only way to
clean that up is to just fight fire with

363
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:58,480
fire and just use dirty cop k tactics
or something like some big summer

364
00:10:58,481 --> 00:10:59,740
blockbuster movie where you're like,

365
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,281
yeah,

366
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:00,611
it is.

367
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:01,210
Okay.

368
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,720
Yeah,

369
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,010
like some Denzel Washington
character from that.

370
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,320
What was the movie training
day where it becomes,

371
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:09,154
um,

372
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,140
you know,

373
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,930
I don't know.

374
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,763
So you,

375
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,001
you,

376
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:12,330
you,

377
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,760
you started just ranting about
things on these youtube videos.

378
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Where along the line did everybody on
Youtube agree to do these smash cuts?

379
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:23,381
Like,

380
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:27,670
will you edit out all of the dead
air in between everything you say,

381
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:29,890
you know,

382
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,540
that weird thing that you guys do?

383
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:31,800
Yeah.

384
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,050
Yeah.

385
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,560
The jump cut.

386
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,920
Yeah,

387
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,753
the jump cut.

388
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,430
I mean the jump cut was a thing before,

389
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,480
before I did anything.

390
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:40,900
I think the guy that popularized
it was zay frank who works.

391
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,090
He's like one of the big
guys over at buzzfeed now,

392
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,120
but I mean just any,

393
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,991
anytime online,

394
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:48,190
it's not for youtube.

395
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:53,191
It's very not a podcast in the sense
of where we're sitting down and you can

396
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,260
take a moment to to,

397
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,190
to drink those seconds matter.

398
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,440
If I don't make you
interested in 15 seconds,

399
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,160
you're out.

400
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,090
Isn't that crazy?

401
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:01,991
I mean it's very.

402
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:04,220
It's very add overtime.

403
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,060
A youtube video is the longer content,

404
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,800
longer content can live,

405
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,330
but it is.

406
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,270
It is kind of what you have to understand
when you're making that content,

407
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,550
but isn't it like in that sense,

408
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,680
aren't you like kowtowing to morons?

409
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,270
You think someone who can't,

410
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,800
can't like pause

411
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,451
that.

412
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:23,250
It's become just kind of the,

413
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:23,881
the entertainment.

414
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:28,350
I think I enjoy a video that has
jump cuts and then if I'm in my car,

415
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,340
I'm riding my bike,

416
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:30,061
I'm doing whatever.

417
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:32,970
That's when I listened to a podcast
or if I might like relaxing.

418
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,110
If I'm at work and I have
12 minutes left on my break,

419
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,530
I want to try and get
in as much as possible.

420
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:39,841
Well,

421
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,360
your videos are very entertaining.

422
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,110
Don't get me wrong.

423
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,321
I mean,

424
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,700
there's nothing bad about them,

425
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,320
but the jump cut thing,

426
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,370
it's just,

427
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,350
it's almost like it just grabs you,

428
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,690
right?

429
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:48,830
Like,

430
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,670
you can't let go.

431
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:49,851
Like,

432
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:51,080
this motherfucker's not gonna stop.

433
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,151
He's not going to stop talking.

434
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:56,150
I says one complete
sentence that you know,

435
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,710
you're taking out every error,

436
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,120
every,

437
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,510
um,

438
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,343
every,

439
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,270
every deep breath and everything,

440
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:02,631
you know,

441
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:04,600
it's just tonight.

442
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,910
Welcome to America Max headroom called it,

443
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:08,480
right.

444
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,313
Oh yeah.

445
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,980
Back in the day,

446
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,520
like all sort of,

447
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,003
kind of

448
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,221
first started,

449
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:15,461
it was,

450
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,690
it was much worse.

451
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:16,891
I,

452
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:17,360
uh,

453
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,800
because I would,

454
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,510
I would edit in imovie and so I could
just shoot one part of a sentence at a

455
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,920
time and then change the frame.

456
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,480
And so if you go to my older videos,

457
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:26,530
it's very,

458
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,131
very jarring.

459
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,010
While in the new stuff sometimes
maybe you get 25 seconds,

460
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,930
how many youtube
followers do you have now?

461
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,300
You to somewhere in 3 million.

462
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,330
Jesus Christ,

463
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,190
I don't know,

464
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,090
how have you done this?

465
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,081
It's over eight years.

466
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,040
It's not like a lot of these,

467
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,010
the new young British kids that uh,

468
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,690
they just,

469
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,110
they make a video where they,

470
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,400
you know,

471
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,250
it's like five things I love
and it's like 8 million views.

472
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,051
Yeah.

473
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:49,591
You've created.

474
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:53,430
What is the other thing that I like
about you is you like me also like

475
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:54,300
chimpanzees.

476
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,163
Yes.

477
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,620
I noticed that your,

478
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,650
your logo has a chimpanzee on it.

479
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,513
What's that all about?

480
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,403
Um,

481
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,590
I don't know what it was.

482
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,433
No,

483
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,040
it's not even like a cool creative reason.

484
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,200
It's for just for greed,

485
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,260
estes monkey poster and my background,

486
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,510
the first two years of my,

487
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,260
my,

488
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,480
my youtube career if
you want to call that.

489
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,920
And I was like,

490
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:17,850
I can't sell these,

491
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,110
so let's make our own.

492
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,200
And that's Hilarious,

493
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,420
man.

494
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,760
We,

495
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:20,951
we,

496
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:21,210
uh,

497
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:21,610
we did it.

498
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,421
3 million,

499
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:25,510
397,000 subscribers.

500
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,373
Damn some.

501
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,140
Should you stand in front of a
camera mostly and just talking.

502
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,010
Yes.

503
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,843
Yeah,

504
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,240
we,

505
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,450
I've,

506
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:31,800
I've,

507
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,640
I've created a,

508
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,550
some new channels with different people
just so that something can grow past me,

509
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,780
but for the most part,

510
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:39,130
I mean that's at the end of the day.

511
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:39,964
That's the main thing.

512
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,730
So you started a whole
business because of this.

513
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:42,970
Yeah.

514
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,140
So I uh,

515
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,980
after doing this for awhile,

516
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,360
um,

517
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,840
youtube came to us and it was part of
this like big youtube channel initiative,

518
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,010
I think they spent like $1,000,000 across

519
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,830
the board and like vice
jumped in red bull,

520
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,290
a bunch of other things that
aren't on there anymore.

521
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:57,950
Uh,

522
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,080
and so I create another
channel called source fat.

523
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,801
And then from there,

524
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:01,634
source fed nerd.

525
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,540
Um,

526
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,400
and then after about a
year and a half of that,

527
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,780
it was acquired by discovery.

528
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,990
And so now we're just making
stuff with and for discovery.

529
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,820
There's so many of these guys
out there doing this now.

530
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:12,280
I mean,

531
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,520
you were one of the first ones,

532
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:18,440
but like you can't keep up with how many
people are just standing in front of a

533
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:20,120
camera commenting on,

534
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:20,841
you know,

535
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:23,180
whatever pop culture or the news,

536
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,140
politics,

537
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,310
things that are going on.

538
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,080
It's a,

539
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,160
it's really interesting that there is,

540
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,860
there's so many people that
are really good at this.

541
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,640
I mean,

542
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,290
this is,

543
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,360
this is something where
if we lived a decade ago,

544
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,540
there's no outlet for
most of these people.

545
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,310
And so they would all have normal lives.

546
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:41,144
They would be in,

547
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,540
you know,

548
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,260
you would be in medical school or you'd
be a doctor by now or someone would be,

549
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:45,501
you know,

550
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:46,334
whatever,

551
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,800
whatever other job they chose instead.

552
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,400
Now,

553
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,700
you know,

554
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,930
they've got a million,

555
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,823
2 million,

556
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,750
3 million followers on youtube that are
hanging on every day waiting for new

557
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:57,531
videos to come out.

558
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:57,681
I mean,

559
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:00,620
you have a bunch of like
really psycho obsessed fans.

560
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,420
I tried it.

561
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm like psycho obsessed.

562
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,660
Uh,

563
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,470
there are a bunch of people
that are really pumped.

564
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:07,900
There are people that
have been with me for,

565
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,870
for eight years.

566
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,140
Like,

567
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,040
and that's for me,

568
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,870
that's like a lifetime people that,

569
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,381
you know,

570
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:15,280
I was wearing a backwards
hat and I had stupid,

571
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,400
a fake,

572
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,960
a fake earrings and fake earrings.

573
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,600
Fake diamond and diamonds.

574
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:20,930
You know,

575
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,960
when you go to like
Claire's when you're old.

576
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,703
I'm 29.

577
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,080
See when you're 29,

578
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,690
eight years is a long fucking time
because the difference between 21 and 29.

579
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,553
It's like man,

580
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,220
you were a child and now you're a man.

581
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,380
Almost one year you'll be a man.

582
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,800
Yeah.

583
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,510
When I hit 30,

584
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:37,820
yeah.

585
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,350
That's when it starts sort of.

586
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,180
I've been waiting.

587
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,950
I've been waiting for
it to feel that moment.

588
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,290
I mean if I met me when
I was 30 I'd be like,

589
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:45,561
bitch,

590
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:46,394
you ain't a man.

591
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,451
Well yeah.

592
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:49,010
When I think about some
of the stuff I said,

593
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,210
I mean I don't know if it.

594
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,900
Does that stop like when when you're 30
or you like I never said anything else I

595
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:54,734
ever regretted.

596
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,210
No,

597
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:56,871
it never stops.

598
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:57,591
I regret some shit.

599
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:58,424
I said an hour ago.

600
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,051
No,

601
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,350
getting around it is.

602
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,020
I mean as a human being,

603
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:03,640
you go,

604
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:03,830
wait.

605
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,663
I think.

606
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,390
I think the development of life is sorta
like peaks and valleys sort of thing,

607
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,830
like you hit these peaks and
then you fuck up and you,

608
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,600
you know,

609
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,190
just like we were talking about before
about a tom score and you doing some sort

610
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:19,880
of a podcast where you lose weight yet
the reality is you'll lose all that

611
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,550
weight and then you'll fucking get fat
again for a little bit and then he tried

612
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:27,551
to lose all that weight and I think it's
very difficult to completely change who

613
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:32,360
you are or to completely stop saying
words that you've tried to cut out of your

614
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:35,990
vernacular or completely
stopped doing certain things.

615
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,640
Like I was listening to bill burr the
other day was talking about he's just

616
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,130
going to stop watching porn.

617
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,570
He stopped.

618
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,430
He hasn't watched porn like four days.

619
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,790
He's like talk like as if that's
some sort of accomplishment.

620
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,100
You've,

621
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,070
you gone for days.

622
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:51,120
Congratulations.

623
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,310
You're not?

624
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,830
No.

625
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:52,961
Well,

626
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:53,810
can you think of what do you.

627
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,880
What's your number that have
gone without watching porn?

628
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,110
Well,

629
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,110
when I've gone camping or
have this like a week flew,

630
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,490
but then the moment I get to the hotel,

631
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:08,790
uh,

632
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,091
yeah,

633
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:09,541
probably.

634
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,550
It's probably never been
more than a couple of weeks.

635
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:13,890
I've definitely gotten a couple of
weeks just because I've been busy.

636
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,133
You know,

637
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,710
it's too accessible.

638
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,630
I'm just trying to think like what's,

639
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,560
what's the longest,

640
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,453
I don't know.

641
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,500
Did you watch it today?

642
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,990
Today?

643
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,670
I know I covered a story on pornhub
for because they released him for

644
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,370
journalism.

645
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,483
Yes.

646
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,670
It's very serious.

647
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:35,151
I know it was,

648
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:35,450
uh,

649
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,283
it was just a story.

650
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,210
My whole thing is like bringing,

651
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:43,070
it kind of gets the HBO model where like
every first season it's just like set

652
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,611
dirty,

653
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:47,570
sloppy sex in random scenes that
make no sense and then they're like,

654
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,550
and we're going to keep you
because it's really good.

655
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,840
Really good TV show.

656
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,793
Like big love,

657
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,090
big love was nothing but like for like
the first season and then it was like,

658
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:57,560
and then here's the storyline.

659
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,750
So yeah,

660
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,071
we,

661
00:18:59,071 --> 00:18:59,904
it was a what,

662
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,030
what countries last put longest?

663
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:04,970
Jesus Christ.

664
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,350
Is it China?

665
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,070
Wow.

666
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,790
I don't know why,

667
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,130
how,

668
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,760
how long they last a.

669
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:10,400
it's about,

670
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,820
on average it's 15 minutes
and then in the United States,

671
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,451
Tempe,

672
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:17,270
Arizona is one of the
shortest with five minutes.

673
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,900
And for some reason just coke hands

674
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,790
find that out a well.

675
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:27,791
They just looked at the amount of time
someone stayed on a video page and then

676
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:28,694
left.

677
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,920
And then for some reason mountain view,

678
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,210
I don't know what's
happening in mountain view,

679
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:33,680
but they last 21 minutes.

680
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,550
I don't know what they're doing.

681
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,000
Mountain view the last 21 minutes.

682
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,103
That's the average.

683
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,041
I don't know what they're doing.

684
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,000
They're probably distracted with mountain
lions outside of their house or some

685
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:43,834
shit.

686
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,170
Put their parents up
every couple of minutes.

687
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,870
Scratching at the door.

688
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,433
I don't know.

689
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,030
Yeah,

690
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,380
it's,

691
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,890
it's,

692
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,690
it's a weird time when it comes to porn
as well because there's just never been

693
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,340
in any time in history where you
could watch people fuck so easily.

694
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:02,920
I mean,

695
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,311
yeah man.

696
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:03,561
I,

697
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:04,151
I remember,

698
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:04,660
um,

699
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,100
it was like a big thing for me.

700
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:10,300
My parents were gone for two days and I
was just trustworthy enough where they

701
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:13,720
will leave me at home and I remember
when you would have to buy a three hour

702
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:18,721
block of playboy on it was like direct
TV and I put a vhs and I was like,

703
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,710
I'm saving this forever.

704
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,900
And like,

705
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,260
and,

706
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,790
but then I was like afterwards,

707
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,930
where you like it afterwards,

708
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,460
where you realized you
made a terrible decision.

709
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:27,941
You're just like,

710
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:28,570
oh no,

711
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,560
the bill is going to come.

712
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,630
And so I'm just waiting every day.

713
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,703
And uh,

714
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,410
and the bill comes in,

715
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,020
I open it up.

716
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,800
Um,

717
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,730
the steam thing doesn't work.

718
00:20:39,731 --> 00:20:40,564
I have to rip it open.

719
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:40,960
Um,

720
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,200
but luckily we have our own things and uh,

721
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,380
and I take it out,

722
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:48,460
I scan it for some reason we have
an old school because I don't know,

723
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:52,030
photoshop or whatever the
equivalent is when I'm 16 years old.

724
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,751
And I like,

725
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,640
I faked an entire bill so that they would
think I got titanic that's held there.

726
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,850
I was,

727
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,890
I was terrified.

728
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,240
But I was very proud of myself.

729
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:02,140
I was very proud of myself.

730
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,330
That's a brilliant way of handling it,

731
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,781
but it was.

732
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:06,910
It was a very in the moment terrified.

733
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:07,361
Oh my God,

734
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:08,110
what did I just do?

735
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,490
But they still paid the bill.

736
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:09,791
Yeah,

737
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,710
they paid so it was fine.

738
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:11,970
So they really never found out.

739
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,410
No,

740
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,670
never found genius.

741
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,710
It's like the one time I
got away with something,

742
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:16,544
she'll tell him now,

743
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,630
just bring it up at
Thanksgiving next year.

744
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,783
Here's the deal.

745
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,230
There was a time and those playboy blocks
are fucking brutal anyway because you

746
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:27,120
never saw real.

747
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,140
I mean you kind of saw sex,

748
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,960
like they would show penetration
for like a second or two,

749
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:33,250
but there was no cum shots.

750
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,840
I don't know why cum shots are important.

751
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,420
Usually no penetration in the hbo play
or the playboy for the playboy stuff.

752
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:40,930
Some of them have a little.

753
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,280
I think right?

754
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,440
Sometimes just like there
was shows that you're like,

755
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:46,221
why is this a thing?

756
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,120
There was sex court.

757
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,920
I don't know if anyone's
ever remembered that.

758
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,090
It would just be like,

759
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,900
it would be a guy that was not paying
enough attention to his wife and the judge

760
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:54,600
would like

761
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,750
suck his wife's tits

762
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,110
just like Josh down to it.

763
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,953
Right.

764
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,650
Just pass down some weird judgment.

765
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:02,940
Yeah.

766
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,773
I don't know man.

767
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,723
It's,

768
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,270
it's just,

769
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,270
it's Kinda odd that technology is
fueled in a lot of ways by porn,

770
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,481
you know,

771
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:13,770
like html five.

772
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,280
Like when,

773
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,870
when that came along like that,

774
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:18,210
one of the earliest adopters was porn,

775
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:18,931
you know,

776
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:20,690
and because the iphone,

777
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,810
the ipads were using html five and
they weren't using flash anymore.

778
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,681
Everybody's like,

779
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:25,950
all right,

780
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,783
fuck flash,

781
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,391
fuck flash,

782
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:28,224
we're going to go with this.

783
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,760
I mean that's essentially what happened,

784
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:30,594
right?

785
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,040
Yeah.

786
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,290
But how is flashy even
still alive to this day?

787
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,890
I have problems with flash every day.

788
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:37,010
Do you guys have the problems every day?

789
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,240
I always forget it's a thing until I
have eight tabs open and then all of them

790
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,900
crash.

791
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,230
Yeah,

792
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,360
definitely crashes.

793
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,433
It's a,

794
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,830
it's just a weird sort of a thing and
it's also got a weird reputation because

795
00:22:50,011 --> 00:22:55,011
steve jobs was so anti flash and so
like outward about some open about being

796
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,040
anti flash,

797
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,200
but yet it's still around

798
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,130
and it's still got holes in it.

799
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:00,731
It's still,

800
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:01,191
you know,

801
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:03,460
a big problem security wise and,

802
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,470
and now with a safari almost blocking
flash to the point where videos won't work

803
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,620
and there's like this little banner
that's supposed to pop up that says it's

804
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,160
like power setting mode or
something that never does,

805
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,020
so then you have to like
update the flash and it's just,

806
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,371
it's,

807
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:19,450
it's a pain in the ass.

808
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,630
There's so many things
that are just happening.

809
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:23,464
Like I don't,

810
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,300
I still don't know what adobe reader is.

811
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,310
I just know that I updated it all of time.

812
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,250
What does it do for pdfs or you're right,

813
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:33,120
I don't know what that is.

814
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,811
Yeah,

815
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:35,880
what does adobe reader do?

816
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,380
Some of them will tweet us.

817
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,420
I'm sure they're like,

818
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,350
I don't,

819
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,330
I don't think I've ever looked into it.

820
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:43,440
I just always say yes.

821
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,393
All right.

822
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,480
Sign did not update the shit
out of that stupid thing.

823
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,210
When you make your videos to you,

824
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,480
do you do it based on pop culture based
on what's in the news based on Shit you

825
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:56,481
want to talk about,

826
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:57,290
like how do you,

827
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,840
how do you set out to create a video?

828
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,340
I think it's 70 percent,

829
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,820
uh,

830
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,020
stuff that I want to talk about.

831
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:03,250
It's a,

832
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,820
I always want to talk about
one big worldwide story today.

833
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:07,750
I think it is actually the,

834
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:07,821
uh,

835
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,510
the Sony story because I mean,

836
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:11,590
this kind of,

837
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:12,091
if you think about it,

838
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:16,300
the stoner movie has somehow now turned
into just an international conflict.

839
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,501
And then.

840
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:18,670
So that's the main story.

841
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:21,670
And then I opened with porn hub's
stats because that's what you do.

842
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,481
And then,

843
00:24:22,481 --> 00:24:22,960
uh,

844
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,531
share some,

845
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:23,800
uh,

846
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,820
some interesting videos.

847
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:26,470
And then there's one other thing.

848
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,220
I don't know.

849
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,320
I had to hurry up because I
had to be able to make it here.

850
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,161
How many,

851
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:30,431
how many,

852
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:31,590
many minutes or videos?

853
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,463
Videos on average.

854
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,360
I get yelled at if they're young,

855
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,700
a long or the shorter than six minutes.

856
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,570
And yells at you.

857
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,320
The Internet.

858
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,690
Really?

859
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,523
Yeah,

860
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,900
because it used to be a two to three
minutes show up because that would be the,

861
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,950
the amount I could actually
try and keep it interesting.

862
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,540
And then it slowly became this seven to
12 minutes show and so that's what it is

863
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,850
usually a and yeah.

864
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:53,260
I'm trying to think if I ever go shorter.

865
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,090
Not really.

866
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,450
You could always put those
pauses backend son now man.

867
00:24:57,451 --> 00:25:01,770
And people would see how strange
that fucker out 10 to 15 minutes.

868
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,710
Like I'm like I'm cringing
inside with all my,

869
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,870
my little things where I say like,

870
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,651
oh,

871
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:08,490
like is rough,

872
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:08,770
like,

873
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,440
is rough and you know,

874
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,000
you know is a weird one.

875
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:12,391
You know,

876
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:12,781
there's this,

877
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:13,290
you know,

878
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:13,621
thing,

879
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:14,550
you know where you got,

880
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:15,150
you know,

881
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:15,661
this guy,

882
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:16,220
you know,

883
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,430
like I catch myself saying,

884
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:17,731
you know,

885
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:18,091
and I'm like,

886
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:19,470
you fucking dumb ass.

887
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,360
You better stop saying that stupid.

888
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,290
He just,

889
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,850
we all need those Obama pauses.

890
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,470
That's what we do.

891
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,060
Philip DEFRANCO.

892
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,753
Yeah.

893
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,221
Yeah.

894
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:31,270
That's what he does to
keep from saying um,

895
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,610
or some people say fuck,

896
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,080
you know,

897
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,530
which is almost as bad.

898
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:39,000
Like it's fucking a fucking guy with
the fucking thing with the [inaudible].

899
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,571
That's my dad.

900
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:39,820
Yeah.

901
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,653
Yeah.

902
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,220
Oh yeah.

903
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,810
My Dad's.

904
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,810
My Dad's pure New Yorker.

905
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,670
So it's like every three words.

906
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,010
What do your parents think of this man?

907
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:47,310
This,

908
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,630
I mean,

909
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:47,940
you're,

910
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,290
you're what they call in quotes,

911
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,550
a youtube sensation.

912
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,450
Oh No,

913
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:51,990
you are.

914
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,680
You're smirking as you say
that to your institution.

915
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,190
If I was going to describe
you youtube sensation,

916
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,180
Philip de Franco,

917
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,620
and that's what you are.

918
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:02,640
You're a youtube sensation.

919
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,890
I've seen a dozen of your videos,

920
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,170
at least probably 20 years.

921
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:07,770
Sensation.

922
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,630
I watched a dozen of your videos.

923
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,270
You are in fact a sensation

924
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:11,951
to be honest though.

925
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:13,690
How many of you watched on accident?

926
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,700
None of them.

927
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,080
Okay.

928
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,291
Well,

929
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:15,620
you know,

930
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,170
usually most of the videos
that I've watched have you,

931
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:20,480
is either someone put a
bump on my message board,

932
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:20,900
you know,

933
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,410
they're like,

934
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:21,840
uh,

935
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,191
you know,

936
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:23,690
listen to this cool video or like in a,

937
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,961
in a,

938
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:24,471
in a,

939
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:24,980
um,

940
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,220
a thread maybe where you're talking
about something that has to do with the

941
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,010
subject of the threat or someone
will send it to me on twitter.

942
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,760
Okay.

943
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,061
You know,

944
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:33,890
but they're always really good points.

945
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,100
You're,

946
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,090
you were always really well measured
in the things you talk about.

947
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:38,551
Like you,

948
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:38,840
you,

949
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,320
you're obviously thinking about these
things in depth and you don't come at it

950
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:43,590
from any weird

951
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,880
ideology.

952
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,060
You look at things very
balanced and I appreciate that.

953
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,271
Yeah,

954
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:48,961
I try to.

955
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:49,620
It's a,

956
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:49,980
I don't know,

957
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,740
I always think of just if someone
yelled at me that I was wrong,

958
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,211
you know,

959
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,480
and didn't give me like any,

960
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,450
any possible getaway,

961
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,990
like give me an out,

962
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:58,891
give me,

963
00:26:58,891 --> 00:26:59,970
give me something.

964
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,450
Uh,

965
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,141
but my parents,

966
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:01,561
uh,

967
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:02,540
they hated it first.

968
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,001
Really?

969
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:03,211
Did.

970
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:03,511
Yeah.

971
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:04,130
My,

972
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,620
well because we didn't know and made
money for like the first first probably

973
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:08,460
four years.

974
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,061
Oh.

975
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:09,541
So they were like,

976
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:10,470
you're wasting your time.

977
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:10,741
Yeah.

978
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:11,574
When I was in,

979
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,430
when I was going through a
premed in North Carolina,

980
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,680
one of the big things was I,

981
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,300
my grades started slipping.

982
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,060
I was kind of just doing it because
it was a hobby and I was going to stop

983
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:21,840
making the videos.

984
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,220
But then youtube brought
around the partner program
which was just their way of

985
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,890
putting ads on it and you know,

986
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,550
you got money and there were all these
big promises and then it turned out like

987
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,150
we were making pennies,

988
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,131
but it was,

989
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:35,580
it was still like this revenue,

990
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,170
which,

991
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,500
which was amazing to me.

992
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,720
Like making youtube videos
and making money from it.

993
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:43,170
And now it's a whole thing
because we're with discovery.

994
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:46,460
We have like a sales team in
New York and just weird it.

995
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:47,190
I mean,

996
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,620
but we didn't make money
for the first four years.

997
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,161
Yeah.

998
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:51,390
But that's why it's good.

999
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,380
It's kids like you did it because you
were actually enjoying doing it and you

1000
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,360
were enjoying the feedback and that
sort of like an apprenticeship.

1001
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:59,490
When you think about like
to get a bachelor's degree,

1002
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:00,840
you're doing for years,

1003
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,720
so you did four years in
youtube and then you graduated.

1004
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,770
It's the 10,000 hours,

1005
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:05,604
right?

1006
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:05,911
Yeah,

1007
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:06,601
I mean Shit.

1008
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,434
10,000 hours.

1009
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,850
That's a lot.

1010
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,030
You know,

1011
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,760
we haven't done 10,000
hours of podcasting thing.

1012
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,280
We've done 580 something podcasts.

1013
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,120
That's three.

1014
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,730
Not always three sometimes too.

1015
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,721
Yeah.

1016
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,380
That's not.

1017
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,730
It's not 10,000 hours.

1018
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,160
It's fucking slot hours.

1019
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,140
A long fucking time.

1020
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,690
But I mean it's,

1021
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,080
it's just the old school
stuff and I don't know.

1022
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,440
Everyone kind of had to
change along with it.

1023
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:37,380
There were a lot of people that were
making videos back then that hated the

1024
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:38,214
prospect of,

1025
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,053
of money.

1026
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,950
That money was going to ruin it all.

1027
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,400
Like we're all going to be wearing like
Pepsi shirts and it was all going to go

1028
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:44,880
downhill,

1029
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,930
but you just have to.

1030
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:47,070
You have to just change with it.

1031
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:47,850
Yeah.

1032
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,260
That is the real fear,

1033
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:49,591
right?

1034
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:53,550
Is that corporate media comes
in or corporate entities
come in and buy you out,

1035
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,640
give you an old for.

1036
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:56,970
You can refuse a next thing you know,

1037
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:59,910
you can't talk about
anything controversial.

1038
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:02,460
You get asked to wear certain clothes,

1039
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:05,130
you get asked to talk
about certain movies.

1040
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:07,440
It would be good if you could
talk about the interview.

1041
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,240
It's our new film that's coming out.

1042
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:10,200
Philip DEFRANCO.

1043
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,650
I'm sure you have a positive
review of the interview.

1044
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:12,960
You know,

1045
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,793
that kind of shit.

1046
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:14,131
Yeah.

1047
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:14,671
We're slowly.

1048
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:18,610
We have a segment called
calls from Collin because um,

1049
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,201
because like I said,

1050
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:22,620
some of the company was purchased by
discovery and then we talked about the,

1051
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,700
was the,

1052
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,840
as the Anaconda video or the,

1053
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,870
which one was a two hour
special of the guy that got.

1054
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,350
Oh yeah,

1055
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:33,000
that asshole that didn't even get eaten
and I just made fun of it and I just saw

1056
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,590
that anytime anything is
discovery and I'll be like,

1057
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:35,550
I'm looking forward to your call,

1058
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:36,180
Colin,

1059
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,680
because I know that
it's going to come down.

1060
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,071
Well,

1061
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:41,590
I don't know what the fuck they were
thinking with that they put guy,

1062
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,040
if you don't know

1063
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,851
what we're talking about,

1064
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:45,430
they put it was called eaten
alive or something like that.

1065
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,670
And so they put this guy in this armored
sort of suit and they covered his body

1066
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:56,410
and pig blood and then they
sort of fed him to an Anaconda.

1067
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,180
So the Anaconda wraps its body around
him and just starts breaking this guy's

1068
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:06,181
body and he taps out this pussy
never got eaten at all at all.

1069
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,280
Like that thing didn't
even put a mouth on him.

1070
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,560
It didn't even get its
mouth over his head.

1071
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:11,870
Yeah,

1072
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,703
it was A.

1073
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,610
I don't know,

1074
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,920
I just sort of like bit.

1075
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:16,930
I'm a little nibbled.

1076
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:17,341
Yeah,

1077
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:17,990
you got nibbled.

1078
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,630
You got,

1079
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,420
you got hugged.

1080
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,253
He got cuddled.

1081
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,550
Terrifying creature.

1082
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,990
He got hugged mean they are
fucking unbelievably strong.

1083
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,270
And that's one of the things that
I was thinking of when I was.

1084
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,530
When I was hearing about this,

1085
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:29,831
I was like,

1086
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:33,970
well one of this guy is aware of what
the pressure of that thing constricting

1087
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:34,720
him is going to be like.

1088
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,370
Because even if you're in a suit,

1089
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,500
you're probably not going
to be able to breathe.

1090
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,570
Like the thing about what they do,

1091
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,460
even if it doesn't swallow you whole,

1092
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,640
is they wait for you to take a breath and
then when you exhale that clamped down

1093
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,330
so that you can't inhale again.

1094
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,800
That's what they do.

1095
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,910
It sounds so terrifying.

1096
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,240
Oh,

1097
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,590
they're the scariest things on the world.

1098
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,070
Yeah,

1099
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,351
but I mean,

1100
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:55,300
I would've done the same thing.

1101
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,160
I would've done the same
thing was tapped out.

1102
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,820
Yes.

1103
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,653
I would've never done it.

1104
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,201
I've been,

1105
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:00,034
fuck you.

1106
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,810
I'm not doing that.

1107
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,060
I don't know.

1108
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,600
I think it got great ratings.

1109
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:02,910
Of course,

1110
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,760
until they lied to us.

1111
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,111
They lied to us.

1112
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:06,810
They had a two hour show where a guy,

1113
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,690
they knew that fucking guy didn't get
eaten and they called it eaten alive.

1114
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:13,140
He didn't even get
fucking halfway swallow,

1115
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,560
didn't even get his foot swallowed.

1116
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,993
You know?

1117
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,991
You think that's the way.

1118
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:17,741
That's what went wrong.

1119
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:18,910
He didn't start from the right way.

1120
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,660
No,

1121
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,360
they always start from
the head and that's,

1122
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,200
that's the snakes choice.

1123
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:23,840
No,

1124
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,210
the snake gets to decide.

1125
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,660
What's really insane about anacondas is
there's people in Brazil that swear that

1126
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:32,680
they can get to 100 feet there.

1127
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:34,390
There's people in Brazil,

1128
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:39,400
especially people that have seen them
like a long time ago that have seen

1129
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,330
enormous ones like we don't really know
like what the biggest ones are have

1130
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,990
anacondas.

1131
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,820
I think the biggest
ones I've ever captured.

1132
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,670
I've been like something like 30
or 40 feet or something like that,

1133
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:51,970
but people believe that
they can grow to 100 feet.

1134
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,490
I have joined it.

1135
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,260
You can tell me anything about
anacondas and I'd be like,

1136
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:57,094
that's amazing.

1137
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,900
I'm not going to question it at all.

1138
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,310
That's when you should.

1139
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,700
If it's coming out of my mouth
for sure you should question it,

1140
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,200
but they're there.

1141
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,230
The whole idea behind an animal or a
snake that all what it does is grab a hold

1142
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:17,161
of you and then wraps its body around
you and crushes you and then swallows you

1143
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:18,430
whole.

1144
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,280
I mean if you see them when they
have something inside their body,

1145
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:24,400
they can expand like they can swallow it.

1146
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,870
These enormous animals.

1147
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,243
I'm not messing with that.

1148
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,460
I'm not going anywhere
that could possibly happen,

1149
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:31,420
ever know,

1150
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,760
but these goddamn discovery
channel shows or any of these,

1151
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:35,040
is that discovery it was discovered,

1152
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:35,380
right?

1153
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:35,890
Yeah.

1154
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,650
There's so many of these goddamn shows
where they're doing this now where

1155
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:38,900
they're,

1156
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,210
they're,

1157
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,490
they're sort of baiting you in to watch
them with these stents and then when you

1158
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:44,450
actually do watch it,

1159
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:46,600
like how about those Goddamn Mermaid?

1160
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,733
I can't.

1161
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,650
To this day,

1162
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,130
people believe that those animal
planet shows were revealed.

1163
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,240
These mermaids are real.

1164
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:55,640
They never said that it
was a piece of fiction.

1165
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,713
They never did.

1166
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,640
They made a documentary.

1167
00:32:58,641 --> 00:32:59,480
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1168
00:32:59,520 --> 00:32:59,791
No,

1169
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,880
I know that like I'm scarred
because there was like,

1170
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,610
there was a show that
was on Fox when it was,

1171
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,570
when I was like 10 years old and it was,

1172
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,940
it was like I looked back
and it was obviously fake,

1173
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,630
but at no point during it did they say
that this alien abduction thing was

1174
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:13,130
faking?

1175
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,450
Oh yeah,

1176
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,140
that's right.

1177
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,973
For,

1178
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,953
for years.

1179
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,271
Yeah.

1180
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:22,130
That one was crazy because no one
ever took credit for that one.

1181
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,173
Right.

1182
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,280
I don't even remember what it is.

1183
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:25,730
I just,

1184
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,120
I just,

1185
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,940
it's just in my brain of I was
terrified of this for three,

1186
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:29,774
four years.

1187
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,141
Yeah.

1188
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:30,441
They,

1189
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,220
um,

1190
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:36,220
that was one where everybody really was
convinced that that was a real alien and

1191
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:40,580
there was a bunch of people that
were like supposedly special effects.

1192
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:42,380
Designer just said we can't even do that.

1193
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,120
They always,

1194
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,270
they get some dummy that's like a makeup
artist is like we're not even capable

1195
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,104
of doing that today.

1196
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:48,471
And then,

1197
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:48,681
you know,

1198
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,690
you talked to like Rick
Baker characters like A.

1199
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:50,901
Yeah,

1200
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:51,681
we are like,

1201
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,000
what the fuck are you talking about?

1202
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:53,834
You assholes,

1203
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,860
but all you need is one person
to get on camera and say that.

1204
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,040
And you know,

1205
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,510
maybe.

1206
00:33:59,510 --> 00:33:59,750
Yeah,

1207
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,111
whoever,

1208
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:01,220
whoever made that was the guy.

1209
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,240
Like that's how he was able to get a
drastic park because like if you look at

1210
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:05,721
drastic park,

1211
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:06,554
that shit's awesome.

1212
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,120
Like that's all CGI though.

1213
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:08,901
No,

1214
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:11,570
but I mean I'm talking about like the
first one compared to where we are today.

1215
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:12,860
Like if you look at the first one,

1216
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:13,460
how

1217
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,000
vanced two amazing ones.

1218
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,740
Yeah.

1219
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,990
I just watched it the other
day with my four year old.

1220
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,820
She was not digging it.

1221
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,710
Six year old loved it.

1222
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:22,580
The four year old was like,

1223
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:23,570
fuck this.

1224
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,240
She buried her head in her mom's lap
and started crying and screaming when,

1225
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,140
when the t rex was chasing the cheap,

1226
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,940
she checked out right there.

1227
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:33,200
That was enough.

1228
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,243
She was fine.

1229
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,450
When the Brontosaurus is,

1230
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:36,380
we're moving around,

1231
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:39,200
but as soon as the t rex
came around and ate the goat,

1232
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,420
it was all downhill from there.

1233
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,361
Point is,

1234
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:47,000
it is super important to stay away from
scary TV for kids because I have a new

1235
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:47,220
one.

1236
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,350
It's

1237
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,240
a good question.

1238
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,261
I think that,

1239
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:50,094
um,

1240
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,551
I mean,

1241
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:51,690
what is scary?

1242
00:34:51,691 --> 00:34:51,931
I mean,

1243
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:56,010
it's good to expose them to
reality in a certain sense.

1244
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,780
Like to let them know
that there's good people,

1245
00:34:57,781 --> 00:35:01,530
but there's also the potential bad
people without actually bringing them to

1246
00:35:01,531 --> 00:35:02,101
prison.

1247
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:02,281
Say,

1248
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:02,551
look,

1249
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:03,100
these are the guys,

1250
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,260
the tattoos on their face.

1251
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,890
Stay away from them son.

1252
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,131
I don't know.

1253
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:08,731
I mean it's,

1254
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,564
um,

1255
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,620
it's a good question.

1256
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,860
Like I think we're entirely too scared
as a culture by media in a certain way.

1257
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,520
I mean,

1258
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,000
I know people that just watch
those God damn serial killer shows,

1259
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:21,661
you know,

1260
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,470
those shows where they profile serial
killers or talk about serial killers or,

1261
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,310
or they talk about love gone
wrong and you know this.

1262
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,940
I have a friend who watches all of those.

1263
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,560
All those hasn't Dvr,

1264
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,850
just can't,

1265
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,960
can't turn from these
goddamn shows on psychos.

1266
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,211
Yeah.

1267
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:40,721
I think the,

1268
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:40,960
uh,

1269
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,250
I think like the demo of that
are 60 year old women at home.

1270
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,543
I'm pretty.

1271
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,711
It's murder part.

1272
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:48,430
Yeah.

1273
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,390
It is murder porn.

1274
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:49,710
Yeah.

1275
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:49,861
Yeah.

1276
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:51,070
That's what Duncan Gaza to.

1277
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:51,460
Yeah.

1278
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,190
That's really the best way to describe it.

1279
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:53,551
It really,

1280
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:57,750
you get some sort of a weird thrill out
of like listening to this story about

1281
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:02,751
how this guy bought all this acid
and say saved it up and you know,

1282
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,410
got a tub and put it in the woods and
chop the lady up and you'll choose.

1283
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,250
Well it's like CSI,

1284
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,180
but real life,

1285
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,170
you know?

1286
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,003
Yeah.

1287
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,581
That is weird.

1288
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:14,770
When you see them in court
and the shackle do like that.

1289
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:15,551
The guy that did it,

1290
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:16,930
that fucking guy really did it.

1291
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,530
Yeah.

1292
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,363
I mean,

1293
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,691
but I'm not above it.

1294
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:19,841
I,

1295
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:20,470
I know that I,

1296
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:25,470
I searched a lot like forever on itunes
and all over the web to to watch a show

1297
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:26,951
called.

1298
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,280
It was like the first 48 and I was just,

1299
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,910
I was trying to go through
the top 10 and I was like,

1300
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:31,061
oh,

1301
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:32,110
this is a terrifying.

1302
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,420
And it's like the number one is,

1303
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:39,400
it's just like a guy killed seven people
and they're all a part of his family

1304
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,900
and it all and you're just like,

1305
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:43,060
what is this is like life.

1306
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,923
This is like,

1307
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,823
how do you do that?

1308
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,420
That's a weird,

1309
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,320
like a weird reality that some people
can go off the rail completely and just

1310
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,820
kill everyone in their family,

1311
00:36:56,821 --> 00:36:57,880
including kids.

1312
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,110
They can kill their kids.

1313
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,571
See?

1314
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:01,404
That scares me.

1315
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,150
Oh yeah.

1316
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,600
Because I have a son now that's a
seven and a half months and I just,

1317
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:07,530
everyday when you look at the news,

1318
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:08,270
it's like this,

1319
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,103
this child.

1320
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,390
Well,

1321
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,223
because in New York,

1322
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,010
that kid or that guy cut his mom's head
off and kicked through the street on

1323
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:14,844
Halloween,

1324
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,660
like that's a.

1325
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,400
that's a thing that mom was account though

1326
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,020
I heard she was a con.

1327
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,110
Like in church.

1328
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,990
She was always telling
him to turn the TV down.

1329
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,824
Shit like that.

1330
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:26,750
Go to bed.

1331
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,020
Yeah.

1332
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,771
She was always telling them,

1333
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:28,281
pay rent.

1334
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:28,940
You gotta pay rent.

1335
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,773
Fuck her.

1336
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:30,890
She made him.

1337
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,270
He didn't ask to be born.

1338
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,790
Did you hear about this video game?

1339
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,200
Actually you covered it the other day.

1340
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:36,860
Hatred.

1341
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,600
Yeah.

1342
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,020
That's.

1343
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,220
Oh,

1344
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,330
is that the one where you had the
video asking if it should be censored?

1345
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:41,950
Yeah,

1346
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,490
it's one of those things where I look
at the game and I try and think of

1347
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,420
everything that I've played in
the past and I've played super,

1348
00:37:50,421 --> 00:37:54,740
super gory violent games like manhunts
and I loved it and like you're looking at

1349
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:56,510
strat guides on how to get the more,

1350
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,860
the more vicious,

1351
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,110
more vicious kill on someone in a manhunt.

1352
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,620
And I think it's more
of just from the outset,

1353
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,570
the way that it's being
portrayed as it seems like,

1354
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,051
Hey,

1355
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:06,291
you know,

1356
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:09,050
that guy that goes to a movie
theater and kills everyone.

1357
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,190
What if you were that guy?

1358
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,550
And so and so it's,

1359
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,600
it's a game that I don't
know if I'm going to play,

1360
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:16,160
I might play it so that I can cover it.

1361
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,250
But I also understand that yeah,

1362
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:20,420
maybe it shouldn't be censored,

1363
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:20,721
you know,

1364
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:21,554
that's my,

1365
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,180
that's my thing.

1366
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,590
It's one of those things
that's a gray area for me.

1367
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,880
Fucking crazy people's
head off with a shotgun.

1368
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:28,671
There was also a scene.

1369
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:28,820
Yeah,

1370
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,230
the massive stabbing.

1371
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,810
And so it's one of those for me,

1372
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,540
it is something where I'm like,

1373
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,440
I'm trying to get where I try and get
past myself because my reaction and I.

1374
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,800
you're not showing this on the show,

1375
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:43,634
are you?

1376
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:43,921
Yeah,

1377
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:44,641
just pieces of it.

1378
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:44,740
It's,

1379
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,511
it's a video game.

1380
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:48,390
Trailer Video Games though.

1381
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:48,840
All right.

1382
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,250
But don't just in case.

1383
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,060
Yeah.

1384
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,930
But so we get pulled off
youtube for everything.

1385
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,421
Yeah.

1386
00:38:54,421 --> 00:38:57,780
We showed nature videos and anytime we
show a video and we go over and talk

1387
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:58,291
about the video,

1388
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:02,550
we get pulled for some youtube
copyright fucking horseshit,

1389
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,380
but it's a good point.

1390
00:39:04,381 --> 00:39:05,310
Like what,

1391
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,370
at what point in time
as a culture do we say,

1392
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:09,060
Hey,

1393
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,170
what the fuck is this?

1394
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:15,000
Like this isn't even like a hero is
going around killing bad guys in a very

1395
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:15,780
violent manner.

1396
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,800
Like you just like.

1397
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,290
So that's certainly killing people.

1398
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:18,981
So that's like,

1399
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,801
that's the main difference.

1400
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:21,510
When someone makes a
comparison to manhunt,

1401
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,470
it's usually you think,

1402
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,100
okay,

1403
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,480
bad guy or you know,

1404
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,180
crazy backstory guy
killing other bad guys.

1405
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:27,840
Um,

1406
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,710
this with just kind of a mass
killing of innocent people.

1407
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,410
You also have to wonder,

1408
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,800
we've only seen one trailer,

1409
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,100
you know,

1410
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,551
is there,

1411
00:39:35,551 --> 00:39:37,780
is there something where there is,

1412
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,100
there is a story there or is it
just intended to make people angry?

1413
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:42,600
But I always look at video games,

1414
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,553
uh,

1415
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:43,861
some,

1416
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:44,401
some aren't,

1417
00:39:44,401 --> 00:39:47,280
but some I think are like
any form of entertainment,

1418
00:39:47,281 --> 00:39:48,114
art in some way,

1419
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,651
you know,

1420
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:49,020
it is,

1421
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,161
it,

1422
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:51,870
is it supposed to make you really nervous,

1423
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,171
right?

1424
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:53,160
Like when you see that and you're like,

1425
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:54,240
oh shit,

1426
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,040
like that's fucking crazy.

1427
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:58,260
How is this a thing for me?

1428
00:39:58,261 --> 00:39:59,100
I go,

1429
00:39:59,101 --> 00:39:59,341
okay,

1430
00:39:59,341 --> 00:39:59,920
that's,

1431
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,721
that's a good thing.

1432
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:01,531
It's a conversation.

1433
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:06,531
It's something that goes a step deeper
and that kid right that they've said

1434
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,040
killed someone because of
grand theft auto call of duty.

1435
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,200
I mean this is just
going to get tagged on.

1436
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,990
Maybe that guy plays that game,

1437
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:19,290
but I know that I play grand
theft auto and I run over people.

1438
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,610
I wouldn't do that in real life.

1439
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,690
Not a psychopath

1440
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,830
do because it's a goof because you also,

1441
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:24,131
you know,

1442
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,450
there are not real people.

1443
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:25,871
Exactly.

1444
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:27,100
And it's kind of naughty,

1445
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,340
naughty to just run people over for fun.

1446
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,170
You just highlighting what
will you just highlight the,

1447
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,450
the actual game.

1448
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:37,360
Like the description of the
games kind of fucked up though.

1449
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:37,841
It says,

1450
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:38,050
yeah,

1451
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:38,591
he says like,

1452
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:41,800
I just hate the world and the human
worms feasting on its carcass.

1453
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,180
My whole life is just cold,

1454
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:47,740
bitter hatred and I always wanted to die
violently the time for vengeance and no

1455
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:51,100
life is worth saving and I'll
put in a grave as many as I can.

1456
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,560
I mean that alone is just like crazy.

1457
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,160
Like he get to be Michael
Myers from Halloween,

1458
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,113
you know,

1459
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,840
if he played Halloween and
you've got to be the psycho,

1460
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,040
is that a valid piece of art because
people are running away from you,

1461
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,770
but is that only valid
if you're the good guy?

1462
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:08,981
Yeah,

1463
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:12,130
but that's a little bit of fake
compared to this is realistic.

1464
00:41:12,131 --> 00:41:15,800
This is you going into a mall and killing
cops and children and stabbing them

1465
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:18,700
and blowing their heads off with shotguns
where Jason's like a monster that

1466
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:19,990
lives in a lake or something.

1467
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,063
Right.

1468
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,990
That's a good point.

1469
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,500
Yeah.

1470
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,320
I mean obviously I don't want
to have anything to do with it.

1471
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,310
I didn't want to plant,

1472
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,950
but should it be censored
as the real question?

1473
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:30,121
Right,

1474
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:30,280
right.

1475
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,400
So what happened was it was taken off of,

1476
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:32,811
uh,

1477
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:33,500
of,

1478
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,230
and then it was put back on once a,

1479
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,010
one of the homeowners looked into it.

1480
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:37,491
And was like,

1481
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:38,600
I don't think this is a valid reason,

1482
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,430
this is us making it too personal.

1483
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,750
This was part of a game coming to the
forefront because people voted for it to

1484
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:45,051
be up.

1485
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:48,110
Whether it's because they wanted to
troll the general public or because they

1486
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,340
wanted to generally play this game and it,

1487
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:50,481
it,

1488
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:50,611
it,

1489
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:51,680
it is always the question,

1490
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,000
are we protecting people by it not being
a thing or are we just telling grown

1491
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:57,980
adults what they're allowed to do?

1492
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:58,790
Yeah.

1493
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,550
But that,

1494
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,410
that is the question,

1495
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:00,980
right?

1496
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,191
Yeah.

1497
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:01,430
It's.

1498
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,260
And that's why I say it's a
gray area because you know,

1499
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:06,530
kids are going to get a hold of this and
who becomes the arbiter of common sense

1500
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:11,330
or decency becomes the who becomes
the judge as to what is and is not

1501
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:12,860
detrimental to society.

1502
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,530
That looks like detrimental to me.

1503
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:20,590
I mean it's like you're entering into
that realm of like the full extreme like,

1504
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,390
you know,

1505
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,690
like faces of death.

1506
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,410
Is that a,

1507
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,243
is that,

1508
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:25,580
you know,

1509
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,510
when you watch those faces,

1510
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:26,721
death,

1511
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:30,010
is that actually entertainment or you
just freaking yourself out watching

1512
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,160
horrific things and who the
fuck has filming that stuff?

1513
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:34,070
Snuff films,

1514
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,610
you know,

1515
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,060
who,

1516
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,260
who's filming those things?

1517
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,310
Were faces of death real.

1518
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,333
Some of them.

1519
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,100
There was news footage mixed with fake.

1520
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,840
Is that what it was?

1521
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,031
Yeah.

1522
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:43,950
I just know that I went
out when that was a thing.

1523
00:42:43,951 --> 00:42:45,120
I think it was like 10 years ago,

1524
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,193
like an east.

1525
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,551
I was just like,

1526
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:49,110
I was freaked out by the
idea and I never wanted to.

1527
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:49,470
Got It.

1528
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:49,620
Yeah.

1529
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,560
How much of faces?

1530
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,650
Death is fake?

1531
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,400
Like we're real.

1532
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,790
Someone like the guy who
shot himself in the head,

1533
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,020
the cop or the,

1534
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:57,221
uh,

1535
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:58,670
the judge in the courtroom.

1536
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,320
That was that faces of death.

1537
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:00,880
Uh,

1538
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,280
yeah,

1539
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,780
there was like the train,

1540
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,520
the woman running across
getting that was real.

1541
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,091
That was real.

1542
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:06,400
But then like the blood orange,

1543
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,210
which was my favorite part growing up,

1544
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:08,661
uh,

1545
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:12,570
that was fake and where
everyone's fucking and yeah,

1546
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,280
that was great.

1547
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,220
What about when they knocked a monkey
over the head and ate its brains?

1548
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,240
I think that was fake,

1549
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:20,300
but I'm not sure what that one where
they're knocking it with a little hammer

1550
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,900
and then they take the monkey brains
out like stir and then eat it.

1551
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,101
By the way,

1552
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:30,101
the worst thing you could ever eat on a
monkey is the brains because of monkeys,

1553
00:43:30,371 --> 00:43:31,940
like really close to a human being.

1554
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:33,440
That'd be like eating human brains,

1555
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,630
which is how they get prions.

1556
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,340
That's how those guys New Guinea wind
up getting Jacob crutchfield disease.

1557
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:41,570
The same thing as mad cow.

1558
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,350
Well,

1559
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,150
you get it from eating brain tissue.

1560
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,150
Cows get it from eating
brain tissue of other cows.

1561
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,810
It's some neurological disease that come.

1562
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,250
It's like nature's
protection from cannibalism.

1563
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,170
Nature's nature.

1564
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:58,550
Like if you become someone who
prays on the same species as you,

1565
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,140
nature has sort of this built in fail
safe mechanism to make your body shut

1566
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:03,970
down.

1567
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,170
I like stuff like that.

1568
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:08,140
I get if you're in an area
where that's the only thing,

1569
00:44:08,141 --> 00:44:08,770
but when.

1570
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,060
When I think of brain,

1571
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,320
like someone eating monkey brains,

1572
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:13,780
I just imagine like some guy
that has way too much money.

1573
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:14,230
Yeah.

1574
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,180
Just everything in life
is boring and he's like,

1575
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:17,014
let's do this.

1576
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:17,441
Yeah.

1577
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:20,010
Some like most dangerous game type dude.

1578
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,560
Once a month,

1579
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,560
humans releases them from his mansion
and attracts them through his country.

1580
00:44:26,351 --> 00:44:26,990
Estate.

1581
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,820
Yeah.

1582
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,520
Was that an ice tea movie was right.

1583
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,830
Whether was what it was.

1584
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:32,041
Uh,

1585
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:32,731
it was also a,

1586
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:33,564
uh,

1587
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,000
please pauly pauly shore movie.

1588
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:36,840
There was a,

1589
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,360
there was a Polish.

1590
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,610
So many pauly shore.

1591
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,160
Come on Google it for real.

1592
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,920
You already wrote philly
directly into your Google bar.

1593
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,310
I really have a Deleno Lena Dunham.

1594
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,293
Okay.

1595
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,780
When you bring up video games,

1596
00:44:55,781 --> 00:44:58,540
this is an interesting time with video
games as well because there's all this

1597
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:00,160
Gamergate shit going on.

1598
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:00,461
You know,

1599
00:45:00,461 --> 00:45:02,320
this always saw this,

1600
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:07,860
this take on women in gaming and
feminism and gaming and you know,

1601
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:10,120
a lot of people think
that certain segments of,

1602
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,530
of gaming has been cooperated
by extreme feminism's.

1603
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:16,030
Pauly shore is dead now,

1604
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:16,864
but that was,

1605
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,711
that was different.

1606
00:45:17,711 --> 00:45:18,544
That was a new one.

1607
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:19,240
Yeah.

1608
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,751
Pauly shore.

1609
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:21,110
His Dad was like him.

1610
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,420
He was faking his own death,

1611
00:45:22,421 --> 00:45:23,250
right?

1612
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:23,591
Yeah,

1613
00:45:23,591 --> 00:45:24,210
I think so.

1614
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,060
I don't know if that was a movie he
maybe I'm thinking of something else.

1615
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,113
Yeah,

1616
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,511
maybe.

1617
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:32,320
But there was a definitely an ice tea
version and there was a really old version

1618
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,370
called the most dangerous game and I
think it's based on an old book or an old

1619
00:45:36,371 --> 00:45:36,851
story,

1620
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:38,710
at least perhaps a short story.

1621
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:40,830
I don't know.

1622
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:40,981
Yeah,

1623
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:41,761
that Gamergate stuff.

1624
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:42,750
I just try and stay.

1625
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,920
I just try and stay away,

1626
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:44,430
man.

1627
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,480
It's too much.

1628
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:45,721
Well,

1629
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:48,180
there are people that are having an
actual conversation and then there are

1630
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:49,950
people that think they're
actually having a conversation.

1631
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:51,060
They're just yelling at each other.

1632
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:51,810
Um,

1633
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,201
and then.

1634
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:56,010
And then obviously then you
have the harassment and it just,

1635
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:56,850
any way you touch it,

1636
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,290
it's bad.

1637
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:58,631
Well,

1638
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,030
the harassments awful,

1639
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:00,850
you know,

1640
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,920
and the feminism,

1641
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:04,910
the overreaction and the,

1642
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:05,130
the,

1643
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,440
the overreaching and some
of the most ridiculous,

1644
00:46:08,441 --> 00:46:12,880
ludicrous points about toxic masculinity
and attaching that to like school

1645
00:46:12,881 --> 00:46:14,070
shootings and things on.

1646
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,310
That's ridiculous too.

1647
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,340
But it's not hurting anybody.

1648
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,090
Like they're just,

1649
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,380
they just have goofy opinions,

1650
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,700
like with the,

1651
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,050
the harassment is the worst part of it
and I think the harassment that's coming

1652
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:28,330
from the side of the pro Gamer gators,

1653
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,250
it's only a few people,

1654
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,260
but it fucks up the whole conversation.

1655
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,120
I think most people are like,

1656
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:34,900
look,

1657
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,230
we want to watch video games
that have girls with big tits.

1658
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,010
Okay.

1659
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,761
We want to.

1660
00:46:39,761 --> 00:46:40,630
And it's okay.

1661
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,190
It's just like it's okay to have big
tits and porn just like it's okay to,

1662
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,240
you know,

1663
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:46,620
it's,

1664
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,000
it's their goddamn like superheroes.

1665
00:46:49,001 --> 00:46:49,421
Okay.

1666
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:50,680
It's like comic book stuff.

1667
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:52,000
It's not supposed to be real.

1668
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,920
It doesn't have to represent reality.

1669
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,790
Whether it's phoenix from
thex men or whether it's,

1670
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,301
you know,

1671
00:46:58,301 --> 00:46:59,320
Laura Croft,

1672
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,221
tomb raider,

1673
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:03,730
like cartoonish representations
of human beings is fine.

1674
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,780
Just like he man,

1675
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:07,780
master of the universe was not anti male.

1676
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:08,380
You know,

1677
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:11,840
when you have these women that have these
ridiculous proportions and you know,

1678
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,440
they have stereotypical
roles in these movies.

1679
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,270
That doesn't mean the movie's bad.

1680
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,340
It doesn't mean it's
detrimental to society.

1681
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:22,870
It doesn't mean it's detrimental towards
a male female relations or female

1682
00:47:22,871 --> 00:47:23,651
empowerment.

1683
00:47:23,651 --> 00:47:25,450
That's nonsense is nonsense,

1684
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,410
you know,

1685
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,140
people will treat human

1686
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,390
how they are going to treat them
based on how they grew up based on the

1687
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:37,390
education they received
based on a lot of variables.

1688
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,510
I don't think video games
factors that heavily into that.

1689
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,730
I feel like the reason
video games are there,

1690
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:42,920
it's,

1691
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,930
it's a soft target.

1692
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,380
Uh,

1693
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,213
and it's just,

1694
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,300
it's constantly,

1695
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,680
there's constantly new stuff.

1696
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,510
I don't know,

1697
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:50,290
I just don't.

1698
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,370
I don't think about it that much.

1699
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:54,340
I know that I like playing games
and everyone else can argue.

1700
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:54,731
Well,

1701
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,610
I used to play as a chick
in when I played quake.

1702
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,410
I played when I played quick,

1703
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:00,430
I always played as the church.

1704
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,120
You know why?

1705
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,650
Because it's,

1706
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,070
it's fun when she jumps,

1707
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,041
when she jumps,

1708
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:04,874
she goes,

1709
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:09,520
she would make that noise when she
jumps and she was a smaller target.

1710
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,400
That's why we play as a
chick because in quake three,

1711
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,830
like you could be that big fucking robot,

1712
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,750
but if you were there big fucking robot,

1713
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:18,220
everybody could see really good.

1714
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:18,620
If you,

1715
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,260
that little tiny chick
this jumping around,

1716
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,090
it's a better character to play with.

1717
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,630
I was just talking to Jamie about this
the other day because I only play as girl

1718
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:26,860
characters in video games.

1719
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:27,783
Always have.

1720
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:28,220
Well yeah,

1721
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:28,680
but,

1722
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,080
but,

1723
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,741
but if I go,

1724
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:30,100
hey,

1725
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,620
Jamie was paying as it plays as a
guy and I play played that girl.

1726
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,850
But like Jamie,

1727
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,460
I was like,

1728
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,370
I asked him why do you play as a,

1729
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,031
a guy?

1730
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:41,010
I mean like if you had to sit there and
watch a guy walk around for three hours,

1731
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:41,681
like just as,

1732
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:45,490
but for three hours that would be gay as
fuck if you just sat there and watched

1733
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:46,050
a guy.

1734
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,070
But if you watch the girls
but the third person.

1735
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:48,790
So looking at.

1736
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:49,111
Yeah,

1737
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:49,570
yeah.

1738
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,490
I always played in first person but yeah,

1739
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:52,320
you're right.

1740
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,710
Why?

1741
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:53,040
Why?

1742
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,150
What is everyone like video game gay.

1743
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,140
Jamie doesn't want anybody think he's
gay and he wants to go way out of the way

1744
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,073
so

1745
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,380
he doesn't want anybody thinking
that he secretly wants to be a woman.

1746
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:08,510
It's cute though because when we play
together it's like we're on a date because

1747
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:09,010
he's like,

1748
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:14,010
I'm like this hot chick and he's with
this guy and should see his character.

1749
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:15,341
It's all like,

1750
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:15,591
hey,

1751
00:49:15,591 --> 00:49:16,391
I'm cool.

1752
00:49:16,391 --> 00:49:17,224
Look at engineering.

1753
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:17,741
You know,

1754
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:18,574
I don't,

1755
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:23,410
I don't want to play any game like
this fucking murder violence game,

1756
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:24,011
whatever it's called.

1757
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:24,550
What is it called?

1758
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:24,970
Hatred,

1759
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:25,420
hatred.

1760
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,350
I don't want to play this game,

1761
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,510
but if you want to make that game,

1762
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,950
I can't stop you from making that game.

1763
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:30,521
Just like,

1764
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:33,490
I can't stop you from listening
to fucking speed metal.

1765
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,440
You know,

1766
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,810
just like I can't stop
you from watching violent,

1767
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,920
gory movies.

1768
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:39,161
You know?

1769
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:40,180
There's a lot of violent,

1770
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:41,830
gory moves I don't have
nothing to do with.

1771
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,030
But who's to say who the fuck?

1772
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,520
There's a lot of like functional,

1773
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,360
normal,

1774
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,480
rational people that like
to watch fucked up shit.

1775
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:49,861
Yeah.

1776
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,110
I mean,

1777
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:53,470
but the thing that thing a lot of people
need to get around is whether something

1778
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:54,440
is being censored in the,

1779
00:49:54,441 --> 00:49:59,050
in the sense of like the government and
the censored in the sense of a private

1780
00:49:59,051 --> 00:49:59,830
company.

1781
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,450
One of the big things gta five was
was pulled off of shelves and target,

1782
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,560
I think in Australia.

1783
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:09,400
There was another place in Australia that
pulled it and a lot of it was because

1784
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:13,390
of the treatment of people saying that
the treatment of women in that game was

1785
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:13,810
wrong.

1786
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,051
Yeah.

1787
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:15,370
There's a lot of holes in that game.

1788
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:16,390
Right?

1789
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,650
You could run them over and shit.

1790
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,553
Smacking Gum.

1791
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:19,571
You could fuck them.

1792
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:20,560
You go to a strip club.

1793
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:21,910
Fuck.

1794
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:22,420
You can.

1795
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,690
Well you can fucking your car and so you
go to the Strip club and you can pick

1796
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:26,730
up a girl and give her money.

1797
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,040
Yeah,

1798
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:27,980
you can get hookers

1799
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,130
and then they start calling you and
then you can meet for dates and then I

1800
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:34,670
wonder if it would go away if they
just made a like a dude strip club,

1801
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,410
like an guy prostitutes,

1802
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,750
if any would be there.

1803
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,510
Oh Wow.

1804
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,380
There you go.

1805
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,030
Oh,

1806
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,680
how dare you.

1807
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,270
It's so unfair.

1808
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:46,971
They did not.

1809
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:47,511
If they did that,

1810
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,980
I'd be the first person to jump in,

1811
00:50:48,981 --> 00:50:51,050
game recorded on youtube and be like,

1812
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:51,550
look,

1813
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,120
it's the first dude onto blow job.

1814
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,193
If I.

1815
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,791
well,

1816
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:57,470
I think that once I've been
talking about this onstage,

1817
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:02,040
I think that once they develop artificial
men like artificial human beings,

1818
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,100
like blade runner style,

1819
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:03,993
it's going to come.

1820
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,620
There's going to be women that have sex
robots in their house and we're gonna.

1821
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,880
Find out what women really like when,

1822
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:14,881
when when you can actually buy a person
that is an artificial person that was

1823
00:51:17,261 --> 00:51:22,240
created entirely in a lab and you could
manufacture their personality and get it

1824
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:26,860
to exactly where you want it to be and
have them do anything you want them to

1825
00:51:26,861 --> 00:51:27,071
do.

1826
00:51:27,071 --> 00:51:28,840
They're essentially robot sex slaves.

1827
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,470
You're going to go over your grandma's
house and she's going to have five,

1828
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,160
seven foot tall Zulu warriors
had just throw declutter all day.

1829
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,410
That's going to be the reality.

1830
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:39,551
That's what it's going to be.

1831
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:42,610
You're going to go over your mom's
house and everyone is going to look like

1832
00:51:42,611 --> 00:51:45,850
Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime and
they're all going to be walking around

1833
00:51:45,851 --> 00:51:49,180
with Whitey tighties on a
giant hogs at black arnold.

1834
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:49,960
Maybe.

1835
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,430
Maybe she likes them all mixed up.

1836
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,010
Maybe she likes Arnold Arnold.

1837
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:54,401
I mean,

1838
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:57,100
they'll going to be able
to recreate celebrities.

1839
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,580
I mean Jennifer Lawrence is not
just going to be on the cloud.

1840
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,910
You're going to have her in your fucking
dungeon going to have her locked up.

1841
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,740
That's going to be real.

1842
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,161
Look,

1843
00:52:06,161 --> 00:52:07,630
it's not that difficult to do.

1844
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,540
If they can make a three d
representation of her right now,

1845
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,710
which is pretty accurate.

1846
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:16,000
I mean the the graphics that they can
do right now in video games are fucking

1847
00:52:16,001 --> 00:52:21,001
incredible and the CGI that can do is
incredible and then you've seen that robot

1848
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:25,450
Japanese face where it's
getting pretty creepy.

1849
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,040
It's getting pretty creepy.

1850
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:29,170
They're getting really
close to human beings.

1851
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,350
They haven't bridged even at videos with.

1852
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:32,970
What does that,

1853
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:33,360
that,

1854
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,930
that valley,

1855
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:35,680
they call it,

1856
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,860
they call it the Erie Valley or
I forget the term that they use.

1857
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,860
That is the difference
between look like me,

1858
00:52:41,861 --> 00:52:42,820
you looking at you,

1859
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:43,601
I'm looking at you.

1860
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:48,340
I know you're really there and there's
just weirdness when you're looking at an

1861
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,160
excellent representation of a CGI human.

1862
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,150
Like we went to the Nvidia m,

1863
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:58,340
a headquarters in northern California
when I was doing the Scifi show and we saw

1864
00:52:58,781 --> 00:52:59,471
the latest,

1865
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:03,550
greatest high tech version of human
beings that they've created and it's

1866
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:04,660
incredible.

1867
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,770
It's so good.

1868
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,600
But there's still some shit.

1869
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,100
They can't do like tongues.

1870
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,413
They can't,

1871
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,270
they can't like do like,

1872
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:16,380
it doesn't look like a real tongue and
it doesn't look like real eyelashes and

1873
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,950
the eyeballs were a little off.

1874
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,830
I think in the future that we're going
to be growing all our parts as soon as

1875
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:21,790
we're allowed to do that,

1876
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,760
we're going to be growing fake tongues.

1877
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,111
Oh yeah.

1878
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:25,341
And,

1879
00:53:25,341 --> 00:53:25,521
and,

1880
00:53:25,521 --> 00:53:26,160
and that's

1881
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,160
what's going to change where
it's actually real skin,

1882
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,810
but inside it's a robot,

1883
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,950
but it feels real.

1884
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,350
Sex feels real for sure.

1885
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:38,640
I mean the robots are going to be made
out of some sort of artificial skin that

1886
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,770
is indistinguishable from regular skin.

1887
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,460
It's going to be heated to the same
temperature as a regular person's body.

1888
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,230
I mean the insides will probably be just
artificial organs and some sort of a

1889
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:50,310
weird construction.

1890
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,140
And then that's gonna Happen Man.

1891
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,100
And when that happens,

1892
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:56,170
you're going to find out
what people actually like
because I think a lot of what

1893
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,270
people complained about,

1894
00:53:57,271 --> 00:54:00,450
it's like people feel
they feel disempowered.

1895
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:00,991
You know,

1896
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:04,170
like women who don't look
anything like Laura Croft,

1897
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,570
like sexism in video games,

1898
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:07,740
the patriarchy.

1899
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,470
It's horrible for male
female relationships,

1900
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,910
chauvinist men who exists
on white privilege and.

1901
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,230
But if you could have seven,

1902
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,860
seven foot Tall Zulu warriors
throw a dick at you all day,

1903
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:20,371
you would,

1904
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:21,210
you'd lie on bitch.

1905
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,100
You would lock yourself up in your house.

1906
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:27,030
You wouldn't tell word you didn't walk
out of your house all frumpy and fucked

1907
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:27,320
up.

1908
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,690
Just Been Dick defied all day confused.

1909
00:54:30,691 --> 00:54:33,810
Your hair's going to be in a bundle and
you would give up on all your feminism.

1910
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:34,890
Engaging bullshit.

1911
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,540
Unless that was how you made a living.

1912
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,033
It would be interesting.

1913
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:40,500
It would be interesting
to see what your friends,

1914
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:40,711
like,

1915
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:43,620
what their version of what
their perfect girl would be.

1916
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,140
It'd be interesting to see if
like if everybody was Asian,

1917
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:51,170
you know Amanda would change for men with
the reality of men is we have DNA that

1918
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:57,921
is designed to want to have sex with as
many people as possible because that is

1919
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,260
the reason why the
human race made it 2014.

1920
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:06,150
The human race didn't make it a 2014
because men were eager for monogamy and

1921
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,500
once they're woman died,

1922
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:11,040
they could never love another like in
these fucking goofy ass movies and books.

1923
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,461
No.

1924
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:13,590
The reality is men want
to fuck everything.

1925
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:13,981
You know,

1926
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:14,814
we just can't.

1927
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:15,930
And why?

1928
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:20,820
Why can't we can't because we either
aren't attractive enough or we can't

1929
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:24,210
because we have a girlfriend and she
doesn't want us to or we can't because we

1930
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:25,044
have a family.

1931
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,580
Whatever,

1932
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,430
for whatever reason,

1933
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:30,390
you want to stick your Dick in a lot of
different things and the reason being is

1934
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:31,440
because you read Dna.

1935
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:31,711
It's,

1936
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:36,711
it's like super simple society and our
culture and our feelings for other people

1937
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:39,480
or the only thing that
keeps us from doing that.

1938
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:42,300
I don't know if there's anyone
that's against sex robots.

1939
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:44,790
I think that if the stuff
that you're talking about,

1940
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:46,470
like I'm sure many wives would be like,

1941
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:46,771
yes,

1942
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:46,960
give.

1943
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,670
My husband said,

1944
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:48,361
Oh shit,

1945
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:49,830
he's fucking bull shit.

1946
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,180
She'll power.

1947
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,360
That dude will get divorced leg a lot.

1948
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:53,790
Yeah,

1949
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,410
he will do whatever he wants.

1950
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,100
He will be going golfing
whenever he wants.

1951
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,290
He's not going to listen
to anybody anymore.

1952
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,370
If you have some traci lords in
her prime sex robot at your house,

1953
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,300
guess what?

1954
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,270
Your wife can't tell you
shit that bitch better.

1955
00:56:09,271 --> 00:56:10,500
Shut the fuck up.

1956
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,090
You're lucky if you feed her.

1957
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,350
She's like,

1958
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:16,770
she's lucky if you let her stay in the
house like you need to sleep where the

1959
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:17,604
dog sleeps.

1960
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,260
You can't sleep in my house anymore.

1961
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:22,680
You've been telling me what to do for
20 years and women the same thing you

1962
00:56:22,681 --> 00:56:23,980
think are going to deal with their

1963
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,150
fucking beer.

1964
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:28,030
Bellied stupid husband
and it's Stinky Dick.

1965
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,250
You know they're not going to.

1966
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,121
They're going to be like,

1967
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:31,721
look Harry,

1968
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,554
it's over.

1969
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,240
You know I got arnold,

1970
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:34,541
one,

1971
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:35,830
two and three behind me.

1972
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:41,170
Three fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger's
with giant hogs in their underwear is

1973
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:41,860
going to be,

1974
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,693
oh,

1975
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,890
we're going to,

1976
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:44,171
you know,

1977
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:46,150
everybody's worried
about population control.

1978
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:51,220
The real problem is going to be not
enough people having babies because no one

1979
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:54,190
wants to have anything to do with
biological people because everybody's just

1980
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:56,680
fucking these absolutely
perfect sex robots.

1981
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,130
Um,

1982
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:57,300
I'm,

1983
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,133
I'm all for it.

1984
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,000
I think.

1985
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,190
I think once we got past all the
weird sex shit that we keep inside,

1986
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:03,371
right?

1987
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:05,740
Because then you don't have to
have another person judging you.

1988
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:06,251
We can,

1989
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:07,960
we can hate each other for good reasons.

1990
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:13,190
I honestly think as much as I really
truly enjoy sex and I enjoy pleasure and I

1991
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,700
think affection is like one
of the best things in life.

1992
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,230
Not just like sex,

1993
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,490
but just hugging people.

1994
00:57:20,491 --> 00:57:20,701
You know,

1995
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:20,801
it's,

1996
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:21,634
it's beautiful.

1997
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,040
You know,

1998
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,270
there's something really
awesome about affection,

1999
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,960
but I think one of the things that's
holding back human beings and one of the

2000
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:34,470
things that keeps us in this sort of
animalistic state is this competitive

2001
00:57:34,471 --> 00:57:36,030
desire to be attractive,

2002
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:37,880
to find attractive people to,

2003
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:38,661
you know,

2004
00:57:38,661 --> 00:57:42,990
to be sexually attractive and to
mate with sexually attractive people.

2005
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:48,120
This is all like weird sort of confusing
shit that kind of keeps us from being

2006
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:52,320
the next level of enlightenment and
reaching the next level of enlightenment.

2007
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,000
And when you look at aliens,

2008
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,650
you know the archetype,

2009
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,850
Gray Alien,

2010
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,950
they have gi Joe,

2011
00:57:58,951 --> 00:57:59,910
Dick's like,

2012
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:00,870
there's nothing there,

2013
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,380
right?

2014
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,580
They're totally smooth.

2015
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,810
They have no muscle,

2016
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:04,651
they have no.

2017
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:06,690
There's nothing sexually
attractive about an alien.

2018
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:07,900
They're just like these,

2019
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:11,010
these sort of like almost insectoid,

2020
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:11,520
you know,

2021
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,690
smooth body,

2022
00:58:12,691 --> 00:58:13,800
smooth limb.

2023
00:58:13,801 --> 00:58:18,801
There's nothing curvaceous or sweaty or
animalistic or there's nothing kinetic

2024
00:58:20,461 --> 00:58:21,210
about them.

2025
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:22,920
They have these giant fucking heads,

2026
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,680
this little slip for a mouse because
he probably don't even use their mouths

2027
00:58:25,681 --> 00:58:26,430
anymore.

2028
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:30,300
They just communicate with their brains
and they have super powered brains that

2029
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:32,550
can move shit with their mind.

2030
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,630
That's probably where the
future is going to be.

2031
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:41,870
If they could figure out a way to recreate
pleasure in a much more intense way

2032
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:47,040
than you ever get from sex and just
do it like with the mind if they could

2033
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:48,180
figure out a way to do that.

2034
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:48,990
Demolition man.

2035
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:49,261
Yeah.

2036
00:58:49,261 --> 00:58:50,240
You're not going to need a.

2037
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,600
you're not going to need
to fuck people anymore.

2038
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:51,991
Yeah.

2039
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:52,610
But I think like,

2040
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,360
so when someone made that alien,

2041
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:54,690
right?

2042
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:55,411
It's all smooth.

2043
00:58:55,411 --> 00:58:56,820
Everything in the future is minimalistic.

2044
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,010
Do you want to be the guy
that draws a dick on it?

2045
00:58:59,260 --> 00:58:59,610
Like,

2046
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,560
because you'll be that guy that was like,

2047
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,650
it should have a dick though.

2048
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,020
It should have a dick and less.

2049
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:06,860
Well that was.

2050
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:07,250
Look,

2051
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,020
if you go to the uh,

2052
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:09,950
you know,

2053
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,720
I had to study this for.

2054
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,530
I didn't have to,

2055
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:16,340
but I read about it a lot firsthand
just for my own amusement.

2056
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,200
But then when I was doing this Scifi show,

2057
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:22,010
I had to really get into alien abduction
and to figure out like what are the

2058
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:22,844
common themes?

2059
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,870
And the common theme is
these people to get abducted.

2060
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:31,871
They all say that the aliens need our
genetic material because they only

2061
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:36,770
reproduced through cloning
now and they need fresh DNA.

2062
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,480
That's what they say,

2063
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,670
but they also say,

2064
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,010
you know,

2065
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:41,320
the,

2066
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:41,680
the,

2067
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,780
the real problem with
all that stuff is this.

2068
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:45,860
People that get abducted or all goofy,

2069
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:47,180
like almost all of them.

2070
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,450
I think that I believe in aliens.

2071
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:51,670
I just don't know if they're abducting us.

2072
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,983
I don't know.

2073
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:53,973
I don't think so,

2074
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,801
but I definitely,

2075
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:56,350
I think there has to be something else.

2076
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,011
Well,

2077
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:58,130
there should be something out.

2078
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:58,400
Will.

2079
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,870
The idea of infinity.

2080
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:01,000
This is,

2081
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,810
was explained to me by a physicist who
said that the universe is so large that

2082
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,220
if it is in fact infinite.

2083
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,150
Not only is there a you
somewhere in the universe,

2084
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,360
but there is a you that has lived every
second of your life exactly the way you

2085
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:22,541
have with every other event on earth
happening in the exact same order and an

2086
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:26,390
infinite number of them.

2087
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,920
So not just one Philip Defranco that has
been on Youtube for eight years and has

2088
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:31,521
3 million,

2089
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:33,320
397,000 youtube,

2090
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,150
but an infinite number of them.

2091
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,000
And every nod that you've done this,

2092
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,690
Philip to Franco has done
every smile like you just did.

2093
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,370
Every Philip to Franco in
the universe has done that.

2094
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,520
And all other possible variables.

2095
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:47,530
Blake Philip,

2096
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:48,030
prank,

2097
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,010
staying in law school up to
Franco becoming a gay method.

2098
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:57,220
Fill up every possible variable that you
could have done in your life is being

2099
01:00:58,251 --> 01:00:59,210
done throughout the universe.

2100
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,920
That's how big infinity is.

2101
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:01,281
Yeah.

2102
01:01:01,281 --> 01:01:02,870
I think when I have those
conversations though,

2103
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:03,470
I get.

2104
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,303
I get like,

2105
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,310
are you still freaking
out about this concept?

2106
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:10,700
It's a mind fuck Philip
to Franco damn mind.

2107
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:11,000
Fuck.

2108
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,360
I mean,

2109
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:11,710
is it,

2110
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,900
is it all those small little infinite
changes or like are you talking about

2111
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,720
dinosaurs on skateboards
in infinity is a thing.

2112
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:18,561
Yeah,

2113
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:19,394
it's possible.

2114
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,450
The infinity is so big that
there's truly no end to it.

2115
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:26,630
Like it literally has no end.

2116
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,530
There is no end to the universe.

2117
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:28,851
See,

2118
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,140
my small eight brain goes,

2119
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,373
no,

2120
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,343
you can't.

2121
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:33,890
It's beyond our capacity.

2122
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:37,550
It's like taking an iphone six
and wavering over an ant going,

2123
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:37,881
look,

2124
01:01:37,881 --> 01:01:41,060
I got the new shit and doesn't know
what the fuck you talking about.

2125
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,111
It can't.

2126
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:44,480
You can't look 16 megapixel camera,

2127
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,770
128 gigs.

2128
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,650
The aunt has zero capacity for,

2129
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,210
for absorbing that information and I
think when you get to something that is as

2130
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:55,130
big as the concept of infinity,

2131
01:01:55,430 --> 01:02:00,430
but we're better at understanding the
concept of infinity than a chimp or then

2132
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:02,330
our ancient ancestors,

2133
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:02,901
you know,

2134
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:03,501
then uh,

2135
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:04,360
Australia pithy,

2136
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:04,700
gus,

2137
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,000
you know,

2138
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,171
what,

2139
01:02:05,171 --> 01:02:05,810
whatever,

2140
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:06,130
you know,

2141
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,340
ancient hominid.

2142
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:12,700
So I think that as our technology grows
and as our understanding of the universe

2143
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:15,194
grows,

2144
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:20,230
most likely slowly but surely our capacity
to understand that will grow as well.

2145
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,010
But certain things like infinity,

2146
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,750
it's so far away.

2147
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:25,201
It's so,

2148
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:28,320
it's so far away like intellectually
for us to wrap our head around.

2149
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:29,490
I don't think we really can.

2150
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:30,001
Yeah.

2151
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:30,780
I mean,

2152
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,590
I don't know.

2153
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:35,010
I just remember in college just waking
up in the middle of the night terrified

2154
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:35,840
of those thoughts.

2155
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,070
Right?

2156
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:36,511
Because it's just,

2157
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:37,380
it's too big.

2158
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:38,131
It's just,

2159
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:38,820
it's,

2160
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,690
it's terrifying.

2161
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:39,990
I mean,

2162
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:43,350
I'm okay with not mattering
in the grand scheme of things,

2163
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,350
but just to think that it's just so big.

2164
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,570
Well then there's the fractal
notion of the universe,

2165
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:50,020
which is even more fucked up,

2166
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,480
which is as big as the universe is,

2167
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:57,840
that it really is just one atom that
is in a person that exists in another

2168
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:03,310
universe that is also infinite or it's
all part of like a computer program that

2169
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,153
always movies.

2170
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,640
There was like four of them
that came out in two years.

2171
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:07,451
Yeah.

2172
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,360
Well that's not just a movie man.

2173
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:10,150
That's.

2174
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:11,020
There's this guy,

2175
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,020
a gates.

2176
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:12,611
What is his name?

2177
01:03:12,611 --> 01:03:13,450
James Gates.

2178
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:14,291
The,

2179
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:14,950
uh,

2180
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:16,210
he's an astrophysicist.

2181
01:03:16,211 --> 01:03:17,740
Or is he a quantum physicist?

2182
01:03:17,741 --> 01:03:18,291
One of those guys,

2183
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:18,940
string theorists.

2184
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,773
Three years.

2185
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:25,060
He has done all these computations
on string theory and he's found this

2186
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:31,350
underlying computer code self-correcting
computer code in all of the equations

2187
01:03:33,471 --> 01:03:34,304
to string theory.

2188
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,930
I don't understand what the
fuck this guy saying he's going,

2189
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,550
he's coming on the podcast
we're going to have.

2190
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:40,450
We're flying them in.

2191
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,020
Really?

2192
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:41,321
Yeah.

2193
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:42,154
Yeah.

2194
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,740
You're staying home for that one.

2195
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:44,853
No fucking way.

2196
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:45,923
There's no way.

2197
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:47,043
Why is it staying home?

2198
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,043
He'll fuck that up.

2199
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:51,130
They'll start talking about poop or
something like that and I'll get confused.

2200
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:52,360
It gets distracting,

2201
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:58,260
but this guy has come up with these
theories that are based on his self

2202
01:03:59,421 --> 01:04:03,970
correcting computer code that was
discovered by human beings like the 19

2203
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:04,804
thirties,

2204
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,760
the this,

2205
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,450
this self correcting code.

2206
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:12,330
He's isolated this and
identified this in all of these,

2207
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,950
these string theory computations,

2208
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,940
so what he believes is that in some way,

2209
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
this may be proof that we are in some
sort of a computer simulation and that one

2210
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:26,890
day without a doubt,

2211
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,350
we will have the capacity if
we don't blow ourselves up,

2212
01:04:29,351 --> 01:04:30,700
if we don't get hit by an asteroid,

2213
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,070
Dyna,

2214
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,140
super volcano,

2215
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,190
whatever we will have the capacity
of technology continues to expand.

2216
01:04:36,191 --> 01:04:41,191
An exponential rate will have the capacity
to create some sort of an artificial

2217
01:04:41,261 --> 01:04:46,210
reality that is indistinguishable from
this reality and if that's the case,

2218
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,640
how do we know that
we're not already in it?

2219
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:53,970
It is quite possible that we are already
in it and that's not just stoner dummy

2220
01:04:55,001 --> 01:04:56,830
fear factor host talk.

2221
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:57,790
You know,

2222
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,920
this is actually like physicists,

2223
01:04:59,921 --> 01:05:04,540
this is actually like people who are
studying this stuff from an objective

2224
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:06,310
educated perspective

2225
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:07,920
and it's cool,

2226
01:05:07,921 --> 01:05:10,910
but when other than finding out if it,

2227
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,880
if it is a real thing,

2228
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:12,620
do you think the.

2229
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,680
Does it change anything?

2230
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:14,993
Yes.

2231
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:15,870
In what way?

2232
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,980
Do you could just fucking go out and

2233
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,990
go balls out out right now?

2234
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:20,190
Yeah,

2235
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,023
but he go to jail.

2236
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:25,540
I know you're going to find the code and
then you're gonna be able to change it

2237
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:26,350
so you don't go to jail.

2238
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:26,591
No,

2239
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:27,580
I don't think you can do that.

2240
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:29,740
I mean I think there's been like any game,

2241
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:31,090
if you're playing a game,

2242
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:32,320
there's rules to that game.

2243
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:32,770
Right?

2244
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:33,150
Right.

2245
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:33,840
If you,

2246
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,110
if you do something,

2247
01:05:35,111 --> 01:05:36,970
it takes away your health and power,

2248
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:37,420
you know?

2249
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,940
I mean that's what happens is
you get on heroin in this game.

2250
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:42,880
I mean there's certain,

2251
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:46,750
there's certain things that people do in
this world where if you think about it,

2252
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:49,740
if you were a completely objective and
you're standing on the outside and you

2253
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:50,021
were going,

2254
01:05:50,021 --> 01:05:50,091
well,

2255
01:05:50,091 --> 01:05:50,860
what is going on there?

2256
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:50,951
Oh,

2257
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:52,690
they're playing a game and they have,

2258
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:52,961
you know,

2259
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:55,410
x amount of years in
this game and you know,

2260
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:59,170
you have cells and everybody's given a
different character and everybody has a

2261
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:01,990
certain amount of points
you're trying to achieve.

2262
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,000
Like I had this friend that,

2263
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:04,210
uh,

2264
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,470
used to manage the comedy store.

2265
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:07,030
You remember rob from the comedy store.

2266
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:10,120
Brian Guy that works in Phoenix now.

2267
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:10,810
No.

2268
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,600
Rob Was the guy that was
addicted to everquest

2269
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:20,230
and he was completely
addicted to everquest and this
poor bastard would come to

2270
01:06:20,231 --> 01:06:22,300
the comedy store and he was Pale.

2271
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:23,800
He would like be Ashen,

2272
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,890
like he looks sick at all.

2273
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,790
He was doing for like 12,

2274
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,220
13,

2275
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,110
14 hours a day,

2276
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,120
was sitting in front of his
computer and playing everquest.

2277
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:32,490
And he said like,

2278
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:37,530
I'm so good at making money in everquest
but so bad at doing it in real life.

2279
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,420
And I remember thinking like,

2280
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,490
you're playing the wrong game,

2281
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,020
like you're in this game,

2282
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:44,854
but this game is,

2283
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,210
you've got to play this game.

2284
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:47,620
The way you're playing that game.

2285
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,900
Like if you went around this game life,

2286
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:54,670
the actual life that the knock on wood
life that you could feel if you played

2287
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:55,271
that as,

2288
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:59,530
if it's a game the same way you're
playing everquest as if it's a game boy,

2289
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,090
you know,

2290
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:00,440
you would,

2291
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,540
you would do amazing.

2292
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:05,290
I mean your fucking balls to the walls
for 12 hours a day playing this game

2293
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,440
where you were a Goblin or some shit.

2294
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,110
You got a battle ax and
run them through more door.

2295
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:10,590
What people.

2296
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:10,780
I mean,

2297
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:13,960
some people make tons
of money from that now.

2298
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:14,320
Right.

2299
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:14,531
Well,

2300
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,250
so I mean,

2301
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:15,491
there,

2302
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:16,660
there's the old school way,

2303
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:18,460
which was a currency stuff.

2304
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:18,901
I was a,

2305
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:19,541
I was a big nerd.

2306
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:19,931
I played,

2307
01:07:19,931 --> 01:07:20,590
uh,

2308
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:21,360
uh,

2309
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:21,850
what was it?

2310
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:24,220
It was like a star wars
mmo and then they ruined.

2311
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:25,560
It was an MMO,

2312
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:27,620
a massive multiplayer online game.

2313
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,410
Most people listening to this
don't know what the fuck.

2314
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:29,880
Sorry,

2315
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,211
sorry.

2316
01:07:30,211 --> 01:07:31,780
I people in before I got on,

2317
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:32,740
Lindsey was,

2318
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,610
my fiance was like,

2319
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,570
be specific.

2320
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,160
Sometimes you just glaze over
shit that no one knows gets.

2321
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:39,760
Oh yes.

2322
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,031
Yeah,

2323
01:07:40,031 --> 01:07:40,331
man,

2324
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:40,960
she's,

2325
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,410
she's,

2326
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:42,310
she's my biggest critic,

2327
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:43,090
which is good.

2328
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:44,710
My wife just tells me not to be retarded.

2329
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:45,890
I'm like,

2330
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:46,960
too late bitch.

2331
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,460
I wish that was a word that was.

2332
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:50,330
That was easier to use
without getting crowded.

2333
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,190
You can use it.

2334
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,971
You just got to fucking.

2335
01:07:51,971 --> 01:07:52,804
Not Given.

2336
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,790
It's not a medical term.

2337
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,151
Okay.

2338
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:58,840
Retarded means to retard to be slower.

2339
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,790
Some people are retarded.

2340
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:03,940
They are slower in
catching on to other folks.

2341
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:07,390
It doesn't mean you're mocking a
disease and I'm not letting it go.

2342
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:12,690
I'm holding onto retard with my greasy
Guinea pause until the bitter end.

2343
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:13,001
See,

2344
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:14,740
I say that until they arrest me.

2345
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,730
I say that in 24 to 48 hours,

2346
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:19,610
there's a tumbler post
with $200,000 like reblogs,

2347
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:22,280
but it's like tell him to suck your Dick.

2348
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,300
Oliver.

2349
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,920
Tell those dummies to fuck off.

2350
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,690
They're all fucking children.

2351
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,010
They're all fools.

2352
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,431
Okay.

2353
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:31,550
It doesn't mean you're an unkind
person and you're saying retarded.

2354
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:33,590
You're not saying it around.

2355
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:34,503
Oh look,

2356
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,560
there's certain terms I won't use.

2357
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,041
Okay.

2358
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:38,690
I won't call someone a nigger.

2359
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:39,261
Okay.

2360
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:40,000
I won't call it.

2361
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,210
I stopped using faggot.

2362
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,660
I'll use it with Brian occasionally
when there's no one around,

2363
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,670
but we're friends and I'm joking.

2364
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:47,361
You know,

2365
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:48,020
I don't,

2366
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,010
but I won't use it.

2367
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:52,010
I never use it when I'm
talking about a gay person.

2368
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,750
I will not use any.

2369
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,370
I won't ever marginalize someone based
on some things that they can't control or

2370
01:08:58,371 --> 01:08:59,204
whoever they are,

2371
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,070
but when someone's retarded,

2372
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,750
it just means they're being an idiot,

2373
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:03,201
you know,

2374
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:05,120
and it's not as good to
say they're an idiot.

2375
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,740
Like you fucking retard.

2376
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:07,910
That's the right one.

2377
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,110
That's what you want to say.

2378
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:09,841
You know,

2379
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:10,200
and it's,

2380
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,480
it's not a medical term.

2381
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:12,620
It never has been.

2382
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,290
It used to be mongoloid idiot.

2383
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,840
They used to actually say
that on people's first.

2384
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:18,743
Soon as you said,

2385
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,140
it was like there was something
in my chest that hurts.

2386
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:21,861
You have a child.

2387
01:09:21,861 --> 01:09:22,250
Yeah.

2388
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,120
It's horrible.

2389
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:24,223
It's horrible that they,

2390
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,250
that we were so insensitive that used.

2391
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,250
We used to say mongoloid idiot,

2392
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,810
but it does feel like there's this list,

2393
01:09:29,811 --> 01:09:30,051
right?

2394
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:32,210
That stuff's just slowly
getting crossed off.

2395
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,133
Bitch.

2396
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:33,840
You're not supposed to say,

2397
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,400
bitch,

2398
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,233
this a new one.

2399
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,370
Come all bells on the podcast.

2400
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:38,540
He said he gave up on the b word.

2401
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:38,901
I'm like,

2402
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:40,400
what be word is this?

2403
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:41,900
What are you saying?

2404
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,120
He won't say you can't say thug.

2405
01:09:44,121 --> 01:09:45,290
I think that was a new one.

2406
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,010
It was thug.

2407
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,230
They were trying to do that with bossy.

2408
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,243
Do you remember that?

2409
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:50,061
Bossy?

2410
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:50,541
Yes.

2411
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:51,091
Feminists.

2412
01:09:51,091 --> 01:09:56,091
We're trying to push the elimination of
bossy because Bossy was disempowering

2413
01:09:56,421 --> 01:09:58,940
young women to call young women bossy.

2414
01:09:58,941 --> 01:09:59,091
Oh,

2415
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:00,080
she's so bossy.

2416
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,550
Like they were trying
to and everybody went.

2417
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:03,283
Not yet.

2418
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,180
We're not that retarded yet.

2419
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:07,460
We're not going to let
you get rid of bossy.

2420
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:07,850
Yeah,

2421
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:08,960
fuck you.

2422
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,160
Fuck you.

2423
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,590
There's a bunch of
social retards out there.

2424
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,390
That's a big part of the problem there.

2425
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:14,810
It is.

2426
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:15,643
Bad bosses.

2427
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,660
I heard him say socially retarded.

2428
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:17,901
I was like,

2429
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:20,480
what's he going to be bossy?

2430
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:22,400
Banning Bossy.

2431
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,460
There's nothing wrong with saying bossy.

2432
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,333
Goddammit.

2433
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,370
Pledged to ban bossy
and pledged to fuck you.

2434
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:33,371
Tumbler went fucking psychos and
they include kids in the campaigns.

2435
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:33,750
Yeah.

2436
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:33,930
Well,

2437
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:34,091
well,

2438
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:35,780
what was that beyond say on the band?

2439
01:10:35,781 --> 01:10:36,760
Bossy bandwagon.

2440
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,300
You're against.

2441
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:37,941
Oh Dude,

2442
01:10:37,941 --> 01:10:38,660
you're against.

2443
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,830
You're against B.

2444
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:40,690
I'm against be.

2445
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:41,830
If she's against b,

2446
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:44,690
he's against the p word.

2447
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,370
That's so crazy.

2448
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,320
People are God damn crazy.

2449
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,090
They're crazy people.

2450
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:51,320
I feel like it's like their job.

2451
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,150
Some fields to just get angry at stuff.

2452
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:53,481
Well,

2453
01:10:53,481 --> 01:10:54,530
you know what it is.

2454
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,670
People have the ability to
affect some form of change.

2455
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:01,130
You know how you touch your
screen and you see that,

2456
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:01,331
you know,

2457
01:11:01,331 --> 01:11:02,350
you touch the LCD screen,

2458
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,360
you see that weird indentation where
your finger is and you're like,

2459
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:05,751
Ooh,

2460
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:07,940
I could change the screen with my finger,

2461
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:11,480
and so you just start poking at it and
some of it makes sense and some of it

2462
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:12,080
doesn't.

2463
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,010
But there's a bunch
people out there that are

2464
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,050
incredibly over-sensitive,

2465
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:16,621
you know,

2466
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:18,510
the social justice warrior crowd.

2467
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:23,780
Incredibly oversensitive and looking to
like in some way pasteurize culture and

2468
01:11:26,431 --> 01:11:29,670
boil it down to this like
completely inoffensive.

2469
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,400
Always punching up,

2470
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:33,270
you know,

2471
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:34,800
sort of a environment.

2472
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:36,060
And that's what,

2473
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,900
that's the same sort of mentality
that's trying to take away victory in

2474
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:40,950
children's games.

2475
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,800
They don't want anybody to win
because then someone has to lose.

2476
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,191
Well,

2477
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:44,611
guess what?

2478
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:45,330
Fuck face.

2479
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:46,890
That's how we get better.

2480
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,630
You get better by feeling like shit,

2481
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:49,381
you know,

2482
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:51,930
one of the ways you get better socially,

2483
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,250
you get rejected,

2484
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:53,870
you know,

2485
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:54,410
you know,

2486
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,380
that's what happens.

2487
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:56,161
Like girls go,

2488
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:57,600
you're a fucking loser and you go,

2489
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:58,051
damn,

2490
01:11:58,051 --> 01:11:58,884
I'm a loser.

2491
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,540
And then he'd go home and
you get your shit together.

2492
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:00,820
Yeah.

2493
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:01,201
When I was,

2494
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:01,801
when I was little,

2495
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:02,634
I uh,

2496
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:04,300
I went to a,

2497
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,320
I went to,

2498
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:06,120
it was like,

2499
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,790
it was always like a subway or something
and then like a karate studio right

2500
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:09,540
next to it.

2501
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,910
And I went there and I
loved it for two years.

2502
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,230
And then I went to my first tournament,

2503
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:16,010
I played like eighth and they,

2504
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,030
the guy that ran it gave me a trophy
for second place and when we got home my

2505
01:12:21,031 --> 01:12:21,481
dad was like,

2506
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:22,380
we're throwing this out.

2507
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,663
You didn't earn this.

2508
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,020
And it's important.

2509
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,670
It's important to earn stuff.

2510
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:28,051
Yeah.

2511
01:12:28,051 --> 01:12:29,400
It is important to earn stuff.

2512
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:33,870
It's also important to realize if you're
freaking out at a lot of the things

2513
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:34,920
that we're saying right here,

2514
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,130
I don't really mean this 100 percent.

2515
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:38,761
You know,

2516
01:12:38,761 --> 01:12:40,380
like when I'm saying looked
at twitter who were like,

2517
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:40,970
oh no,

2518
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:41,300
no,

2519
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:41,550
no,

2520
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:42,630
I'm sure it's happening,

2521
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,201
but I don't,

2522
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:45,510
I don't really mean it
when I'm saying like

2523
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:48,750
when I'm here,

2524
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:50,043
here's a problem.

2525
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:55,550
People are extremely sensitive about
certain subjects and when people joke

2526
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:58,650
around about those subjects,

2527
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,910
people freak out,

2528
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:00,690
you know,

2529
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:02,970
and it doesn't mean that
you're a bad person.

2530
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:07,170
It doesn't mean that
you really hate anybody,

2531
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:12,680
but people like to have fun and talk
shit and when people like to have fun and

2532
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:17,580
talk shit and people jump all over it
as if this is some sort of a statement

2533
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:19,950
they're giving a court like
some sort of an affidavit,

2534
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,031
like you're,

2535
01:13:21,031 --> 01:13:24,450
you're missing out on the subtle
nuances of human interaction.

2536
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,720
Like people say things that they
don't really mean because it's funny,

2537
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,080
right?

2538
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,340
Because they're fucking around.

2539
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:29,791
Yeah.

2540
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:31,460
I think what Bill Burke
covers that in his new,

2541
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,820
a new special on Netflix.

2542
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:33,331
Yeah.

2543
01:13:33,331 --> 01:13:33,680
Yeah,

2544
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,490
it does.

2545
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:34,650
Yeah.

2546
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:36,570
It's just like people taking
stuff where it's like,

2547
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,830
obviously I'm joking.

2548
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:40,320
I don't think I should beat my wife.

2549
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:40,761
Well,

2550
01:13:40,761 --> 01:13:44,090
I had a whole bit about it in
my comedy central special about,

2551
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:45,201
about,

2552
01:13:45,201 --> 01:13:45,440
uh,

2553
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,960
Tracy Morgan about Tracy Morgan's.

2554
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:51,620
I think I actually just confused
you with what I was thinking too,

2555
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:53,930
because I just watched bill special.

2556
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:55,280
I didn't remember that part,

2557
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,510
but that the Tracy Morgan thing with Tracy
Morgan got in trouble for saying that

2558
01:13:59,511 --> 01:14:00,201
if his son was gay,

2559
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:01,034
he would stab them.

2560
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,350
Obviously that's a horrible thing.

2561
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:07,040
But he also said that he would eat a
mile of shit to get to beyonce is booty

2562
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,200
like that's the part of
in my act like come on.

2563
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:12,910
He says ridiculous shit
that's not actually true.

2564
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:18,060
And he's saying it in a medium and
entertainment medium where if you watch a

2565
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:19,420
movie,

2566
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:19,901
okay,

2567
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:23,110
and the transformers destroy these
buildings and someone gets stomped,

2568
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:23,501
guess what?

2569
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:24,610
No one really got stomped.

2570
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,020
No buildings really got destroyed.

2571
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,940
Bob Marley didn't really
shoot the sheriff,

2572
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:28,181
you know,

2573
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:29,320
that's the point of the,

2574
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:30,030
you know,

2575
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:30,863
the bit.

2576
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:31,893
But this,

2577
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:37,050
this idea that everything is supposed
to be homogenized and calm down and come

2578
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:37,751
on,

2579
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:38,410
this is ridiculous.

2580
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:38,590
Yeah.

2581
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:42,760
I think we all want to society right
where we all have our worth based on what

2582
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:43,560
we do and like we,

2583
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,590
we respect each other,

2584
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:47,500
but not so much where there is no fun.

2585
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:48,141
Exactly.

2586
01:14:48,141 --> 01:14:48,980
There's no fun left.

2587
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:49,700
Exactly.

2588
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:54,700
And part of the fun is saying Shit
that you look like you're you,

2589
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:56,660
you say shit.

2590
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,550
That is ridiculous.

2591
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:03,730
That is fun to say because you know that
you don't mean it and you assume that

2592
01:15:04,101 --> 01:15:09,101
your friends know you don't mean it as
well and that's part of the subtle nuance

2593
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:13,940
of fucking around with your friends and
the problem with trying to do that in

2594
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:16,490
public is that people
will latch onto that.

2595
01:15:16,491 --> 01:15:17,181
They'll take it,

2596
01:15:17,181 --> 01:15:18,380
they'll take it as a quote,

2597
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:22,190
they'll put it in quotes and they'll
pretend that this is an actual statement

2598
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:24,710
and this is how you
actually believe and feel,

2599
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,660
and then they'll just
write a blog about it.

2600
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,020
They'll write a tumblr blog and get super
upset about it and that's what you're

2601
01:15:30,021 --> 01:15:30,681
talking about.

2602
01:15:30,681 --> 01:15:33,350
Like don't you say retard someone's
gonna write this huge blog,

2603
01:15:33,351 --> 01:15:34,190
but he hate people.

2604
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,960
That's not what's going on.

2605
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:39,850
It's not what's going on and in pretending
what you're doing is you're focusing

2606
01:15:39,851 --> 01:15:43,850
on something that's not really that
important and you're pretending it is and

2607
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,560
there's a lot of real issues in the world,

2608
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:45,801
right?

2609
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:50,420
You could be focusing your attention
on instead of someone saying retard or

2610
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,201
someone saying,

2611
01:15:51,201 --> 01:15:54,250
your mom's going to have a giant
black robot fucked all that.

2612
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:56,330
That throws Dick all day,

2613
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:58,040
all day,

2614
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,540
and she's going to kick
your dad out of the house.

2615
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:00,710
You fat fucking loser.

2616
01:16:00,711 --> 01:16:01,461
You'd get Outta here.

2617
01:16:01,461 --> 01:16:02,540
Arnold's gonna fuck me now.

2618
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,020
Yeah,

2619
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:03,920
but that's not real.

2620
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:04,190
I don't.

2621
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,390
We don't really mean that,

2622
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:09,440
but we live in this time
where anybody has a voice.

2623
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:14,560
Anybody can just write something on
twitter or write something on facebook or

2624
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,370
Tumblr and I think that's good.

2625
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,233
I think it's good,

2626
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:22,450
but right now there's a sort of balancing
out stage where people are still

2627
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,910
freaking out about these things
and they're just like this,

2628
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:31,280
this sort of new
understanding of this ability,

2629
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:33,980
this new understanding of this
ability to freak out about that.

2630
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:34,341
Yeah,

2631
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:36,260
but I think a lot of people
don't realize the power.

2632
01:16:36,261 --> 01:16:36,500
I mean,

2633
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:36,920
the main,

2634
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,070
the main thing that you see specifically
with celebrities and sometimes they'll,

2635
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:42,890
they'll say something just
offhand and then it'll just,

2636
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,790
it we will get warped and then other
people feeling like they're so small that

2637
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,040
they can just literally say anything,

2638
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:52,880
anything like the most vile crap ever
because it's the internet and they're

2639
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:53,060
like.

2640
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:53,893
And it's fun.

2641
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:54,720
Yeah.

2642
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:54,961
Yeah.

2643
01:16:54,961 --> 01:16:56,490
That is a thing that people do.

2644
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:57,420
Like Jonah Hill,

2645
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,100
when he called some reporter,

2646
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:00,960
he called someone a faggot.

2647
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:02,310
It was like the guy that was like,

2648
01:17:02,311 --> 01:17:02,431
yeah,

2649
01:17:02,431 --> 01:17:03,290
he was like harassing him,

2650
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,050
not alone.

2651
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:04,680
Yeah.

2652
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,251
And then he,

2653
01:17:05,251 --> 01:17:05,430
uh,

2654
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:10,430
he sort of apologized for it and it
became like a big and became the word he

2655
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:15,020
used became more important than someone
like following him around and sticking a

2656
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:15,771
camera in his face,

2657
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:16,700
violating his,

2658
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,780
his personal freedom or
violating his privacy,

2659
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:21,850
you know,

2660
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,360
it became all about a word,

2661
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,440
you know,

2662
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:24,701
that.

2663
01:17:24,701 --> 01:17:25,550
And that's unfortunate.

2664
01:17:25,551 --> 01:17:27,290
It's like he chose the wrong word,

2665
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:27,700
you know,

2666
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:28,330
if he said,

2667
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:28,730
you know,

2668
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:29,211
get out of here,

2669
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,410
you fucking parasite.

2670
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:34,070
Then it would have been more about the
behavior of the person falling him with a

2671
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:37,110
camera that it would have been about
him reacting to that person with

2672
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:38,200
well and the whole,

2673
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:38,511
the whole.

2674
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:39,740
That whole story ended up being.

2675
01:17:39,741 --> 01:17:39,900
Yes,

2676
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:42,500
specifically about the word
and then his apology for it.

2677
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,090
Which it's always interesting to see
famous people go on like a tonight show or

2678
01:17:47,091 --> 01:17:48,310
something like that to apologize.

2679
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:49,190
Tie On.

2680
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:49,431
Yeah.

2681
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:50,890
And you're just like,

2682
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:52,440
we know that this is like,

2683
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:54,200
it's a setup moment.

2684
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,771
Right?

2685
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:56,780
And it's like you giving
this statement and it's just,

2686
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:57,643
it's,

2687
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,513
it's so weird.

2688
01:17:58,530 --> 01:17:59,363
Yeah.

2689
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,383
It's sad.

2690
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:01,463
Yeah.

2691
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:02,401
But it is,

2692
01:18:02,401 --> 01:18:02,971
but you know,

2693
01:18:02,971 --> 01:18:03,990
people are scared.

2694
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:06,540
They're scared of a PR thing,

2695
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,100
but that's also a thing that I understand.

2696
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:11,830
Like I never had to grow up
worried that I was going to beat.

2697
01:18:11,831 --> 01:18:14,970
I get beat up because of my sexual
orientation that no one was ever going to

2698
01:18:14,971 --> 01:18:16,560
like tie me to a fence
and beat me to death.

2699
01:18:16,561 --> 01:18:17,394
So when,

2700
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,210
when I think a lot of people take it
to the next level when they talk about

2701
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:26,211
things like where I like offhand mention
white privilege because I didn't have

2702
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:27,570
to go through that.

2703
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:31,680
I do get annoyed by the people on the
extreme end of the argument that act like

2704
01:18:31,681 --> 01:18:35,930
I can't have an opinion on anything
because of the color of my skin and my and

2705
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,580
my and my and my sexual
orientation or any of these things.

2706
01:18:38,581 --> 01:18:39,240
But it's,

2707
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:39,620
I don't know,

2708
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:40,310
I get it.

2709
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:40,560
It's,

2710
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,330
it's the world is gray man.

2711
01:18:42,331 --> 01:18:42,720
I get it.

2712
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,690
It is very gray.

2713
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,470
It is.

2714
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,010
It's like,

2715
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:45,401
you know,

2716
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:47,020
would you use the term like,

2717
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:47,973
you know,

2718
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:48,550
if,

2719
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:49,750
if I said shut up bitch,

2720
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,340
would you use that?

2721
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:54,460
If you are around a woman who
had just been called a bitch,

2722
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:54,941
you know,

2723
01:18:54,941 --> 01:18:57,850
if someone had just yelled at
you stupid bitch at a woman,

2724
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,460
which is the worst way
you could use that term.

2725
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:02,450
Would I still say to Barnes,

2726
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:02,951
bitch,

2727
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:03,784
get the fuck out of here.

2728
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:06,190
Then you would be more sensitive about.

2729
01:19:06,191 --> 01:19:06,551
He'd be like,

2730
01:19:06,551 --> 01:19:07,690
well I can't.

2731
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,020
We've got to get away from this chicken,

2732
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:09,873
then I'll call you a bitch,

2733
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:10,833
you know,

2734
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:14,590
or I'll use the term bitch about myself,

2735
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,191
you know,

2736
01:19:15,191 --> 01:19:15,760
I'll say,

2737
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,421
you know,

2738
01:19:16,421 --> 01:19:19,150
I'll do something stupid.

2739
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,051
I'll be like,

2740
01:19:20,051 --> 01:19:20,381
bitch,

2741
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,510
do you even know how to
fucking turn your car?

2742
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,373
You know what I mean?

2743
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:23,830
I'll,

2744
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:28,000
I'll use it at me as well as
I'll use it at someone else.

2745
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:31,600
But would I do that if somebody had just
been called it in a very hateful way?

2746
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:32,180
No,

2747
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:33,370
but that's where it gets weird.

2748
01:19:33,371 --> 01:19:34,420
That's where it gets gray,

2749
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,021
you know,

2750
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:38,020
like that's why the word
faggot is just like,

2751
01:19:38,021 --> 01:19:42,610
it's just too complicated because even
though the intent is what's important

2752
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:47,611
when you're dealing with words like
in the intent is not homosexual slur.

2753
01:19:48,911 --> 01:19:51,900
Your friend is a homosexual
and you're making no.

2754
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:54,310
It's like he's a wimp or he's.

2755
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:55,091
And then you go,

2756
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:55,331
well,

2757
01:19:55,331 --> 01:19:55,571
okay,

2758
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:56,111
what does that mean?

2759
01:19:56,111 --> 01:19:56,290
Then?

2760
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:57,550
Does that mean that gay men are wimps?

2761
01:19:57,551 --> 01:19:57,761
Well,

2762
01:19:57,761 --> 01:19:58,001
no,

2763
01:19:58,001 --> 01:19:58,834
that's not what you mean.

2764
01:19:58,930 --> 01:19:59,111
Well,

2765
01:19:59,111 --> 01:20:00,670
you probably need to come
up with a better word.

2766
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:01,690
It's like the word.

2767
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:05,230
The problem with that word is that it's
ineffective and conveying the actual

2768
01:20:05,231 --> 01:20:06,910
thought because it's too easily,

2769
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:12,890
it's too easily connected to gay slurs
or two things that have incredibly

2770
01:20:13,171 --> 01:20:18,171
negative connotations or are
just their prejudice terms,

2771
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,600
so you have to kind of let them go
and come up with something else.

2772
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:20,911
Yeah,

2773
01:20:20,911 --> 01:20:21,744
I leave it alone.

2774
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,580
If it's those two words,

2775
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:24,480
I say,

2776
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:25,020
oh no,

2777
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,110
those groups can talk about it and Louis
Ck can talk about it and that's it.

2778
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,161
I just stay away.

2779
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:29,431
I go,

2780
01:20:29,431 --> 01:20:29,910
nope,

2781
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:30,180
nope.

2782
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:30,910
Not going to say it.

2783
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:31,930
Those two groups.

2784
01:20:31,931 --> 01:20:32,201
Yeah.

2785
01:20:32,201 --> 01:20:34,960
That's the thing about gay people
are allowed to use the f word.

2786
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:35,943
They could say it,

2787
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,120
they call each other fags,

2788
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:38,910
but if I was,

2789
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:39,481
oh man,

2790
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:43,760
if I was black I would just use that
word to all my white friends just because

2791
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:45,210
some like some will get excited,

2792
01:20:45,211 --> 01:20:46,110
but others would just be like,

2793
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:48,293
okay,

2794
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,730
I'm going to leave this
situation right now.

2795
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:51,841
I know.

2796
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:52,381
It's funny,

2797
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:52,711
man.

2798
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:53,270
It's funny.

2799
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:53,850
It's

2800
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,560
languages is an incredible thing.

2801
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,700
I mean there's so much.

2802
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,080
There's so much subtlety,

2803
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:58,741
there's so much.

2804
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:03,600
There's so many different ways you
can say a sentence and have different

2805
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:04,230
meanings,

2806
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:04,831
you know,

2807
01:21:04,831 --> 01:21:09,360
and people are really sensitive about
that today more than ever because we can

2808
01:21:09,361 --> 01:21:12,480
analyze things in a way and
then communicate our analysis,

2809
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:13,340
communicate our,

2810
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:13,860
you know,

2811
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:17,160
our interpretation of how you're
speaking and communicate that.

2812
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:21,240
And all you have to do is say something
like if you say something fucked up and

2813
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:23,250
someone takes it
completely out of context,

2814
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:25,080
you put it on twitter or facebook,

2815
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:26,220
whatever you like,

2816
01:21:26,221 --> 01:21:26,510
you,

2817
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:27,170
you know,

2818
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:29,220
that sort of click baity in a lot of ways.

2819
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,730
But it also a lot of ways
like you did say that word,

2820
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:33,241
you know,

2821
01:21:33,241 --> 01:21:34,680
you did say it in that term,

2822
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:38,520
but it's not in the greater context of
the conversation that you're having,

2823
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:39,001
you know,

2824
01:21:39,001 --> 01:21:42,120
and that's what's lost in
the flat medium of print.

2825
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,870
That two dimensional medium of taking
something in quotes and putting it in

2826
01:21:45,871 --> 01:21:49,350
print and that sort of the point that I
was trying to make in my comedy central

2827
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:50,130
special.

2828
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:50,963
And that's,

2829
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:51,321
you know,

2830
01:21:51,321 --> 01:21:54,960
that's something that's being lost
today when people were just looking for

2831
01:21:54,961 --> 01:21:56,160
things to be upset about.

2832
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,430
Right.

2833
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:58,240
I don't know,

2834
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:58,520
I,

2835
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,600
I feel like I am constantly
dodging stuff like that.

2836
01:22:01,601 --> 01:22:05,440
Just because someone said
you can't say thug anymore.

2837
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:06,291
I was quote,

2838
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:08,980
I was quoting someone and I said ratchet.

2839
01:22:08,981 --> 01:22:10,520
And I liked and I like,

2840
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,070
yeah.

2841
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:11,300
And I,

2842
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,010
and I was like,

2843
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:12,760
oh whoa.

2844
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,120
I was like,

2845
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,301
oh,

2846
01:22:13,301 --> 01:22:14,110
she ratchet.

2847
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:15,150
And that's when I,

2848
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,590
when I say like the tumbler
posts of like 200,000,

2849
01:22:17,591 --> 01:22:18,191
there was a tumblr post,

2850
01:22:18,191 --> 01:22:22,600
I think it has like a $100,000 that I
used a aggressive racialized language.

2851
01:22:22,601 --> 01:22:23,130
And I was like,

2852
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:23,840
wait,

2853
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:24,673
what?

2854
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,103
No,

2855
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:27,820
what's wrong with ratchet?

2856
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:28,421
I don't know.

2857
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:29,180
It's,

2858
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:30,180
you can't say ratchet.

2859
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:31,870
It speaks down to

2860
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:37,170
ratchet is like a tool
in reference to a person,

2861
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:37,480
you know,

2862
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,260
that's like an earth.

2863
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:38,520
Oh,

2864
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,370
I don't know that.

2865
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:39,651
Yeah,

2866
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:39,860
like,

2867
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,290
like,

2868
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:40,630
like,

2869
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:41,381
like that girl,

2870
01:22:41,381 --> 01:22:42,131
look at her shoes,

2871
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:44,560
they're so ratchet or
that girl is ratchet,

2872
01:22:44,561 --> 01:22:47,250
meaning like she is like,

2873
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,510
like what would it be?

2874
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:50,560
Like trashy.

2875
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:50,980
Yeah.

2876
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:51,311
Yeah.

2877
01:22:51,311 --> 01:22:51,491
I,

2878
01:22:51,491 --> 01:22:51,970
uh,

2879
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:53,680
but I also can't keep up with stuff.

2880
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:56,650
I think that's when I realized I'm
getting old where I'm just like,

2881
01:22:56,651 --> 01:22:57,790
I see new words and I'm like,

2882
01:22:57,791 --> 01:22:58,750
I'm not going to care.

2883
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,040
Like I saw there was,

2884
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:02,400
is it pronounced here?

2885
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,360
I don't even know if it's
an inappropriate word,

2886
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,460
but like thought it's like t h o,

2887
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:06,761
t,

2888
01:23:06,761 --> 01:23:07,630
and I think it just means like,

2889
01:23:07,631 --> 01:23:08,280
whoa.

2890
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,090
Right.

2891
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:09,923
And I'm just like,

2892
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:10,250
why?

2893
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:10,760
Wait,

2894
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,350
hold on,

2895
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:11,691
hold on.

2896
01:23:11,691 --> 01:23:13,090
I need a new word that's bigger.

2897
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,070
I am so out of the loop.

2898
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:15,310
God,

2899
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:15,970
I'm getting old.

2900
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:17,830
So ratchet is what,

2901
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:19,390
like trashy,

2902
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:20,140
trashy,

2903
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:20,291
like,

2904
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:21,490
like she's so ratchet.

2905
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:23,830
Hold the neck.

2906
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:24,430
Can you do that again?

2907
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:25,263
She's so rad.

2908
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:28,000
I mean I did a 25 year old Latina.

2909
01:23:28,001 --> 01:23:30,100
That's the only reason I go.

2910
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:31,003
Okay.

2911
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,160
And so ratchet is bad.

2912
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,780
You get in trouble for saying ratchet.

2913
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:35,910
I didn't think I would,

2914
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:36,170
I didn't.

2915
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:37,630
I was quoting it and then uh,

2916
01:23:37,631 --> 01:23:37,871
yeah.

2917
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:38,650
And then it just.

2918
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:41,020
But that's the thing is
people just take the sentence,

2919
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,190
put it in quotes.

2920
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:45,410
As we were doing this conversation,

2921
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:50,440
someone actually responded
exactly the way I was mocking.

2922
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:53,510
This is on twitter in quotes.

2923
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,700
That bitch should just shut the fuck up.

2924
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:59,000
She's lucky you feed her an exact quote,

2925
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:00,380
all caps from Joe Rogan.

2926
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:01,250
Alyssa,

2927
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,660
you fucking dummy.

2928
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,240
We're talking about robots.

2929
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,760
We're talking about robot fuck dolls.

2930
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:08,690
Fake scenarios,

2931
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,430
and by the way dummy,

2932
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:15,230
I also said that in the term of the woman
mocking the man and kicking him out,

2933
01:24:15,231 --> 01:24:17,270
which you conveniently
decided not to quote.

2934
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:18,471
See,

2935
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:19,310
this is what I'm saying.

2936
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:21,760
If women were to just get fucked,

2937
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:23,600
they wouldn't be feminist in quotes.

2938
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:25,670
Literally a thing Joe Rogan just said,

2939
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,690
did I say that

2940
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,940
you should go.

2941
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,640
You should go through and see how
long that person has been quoting you.

2942
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,110
Did I say if women were
to just get fucked,

2943
01:24:33,111 --> 01:24:34,070
they wouldn't be feminist.

2944
01:24:34,071 --> 01:24:34,904
That I say that,

2945
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:36,943
look,

2946
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,180
this is hilarious.

2947
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:41,780
This philly d interviews should
just be called the Joe Rogan sexist,

2948
01:24:41,781 --> 01:24:42,620
our this.

2949
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:46,910
This gal must be a wonderful
person to hang out with.

2950
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:50,090
She's not oversensitive at all.

2951
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:50,241
Oh,

2952
01:24:50,241 --> 01:24:50,781
here's another thing.

2953
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:53,210
She wrote dear men of
the universe in all caps.

2954
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:54,890
In the grand scheme of things,

2955
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,020
your Dick is so insignificant.

2956
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,093
You're right.

2957
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:58,640
Yeah,

2958
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,473
that's true.

2959
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,100
You have to tell everybody that though.

2960
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:05,270
Why would you want to diminish a man by
saying that in the greater scheme of the

2961
01:25:05,271 --> 01:25:05,550
thing?

2962
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:05,750
Oh yeah.

2963
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:06,710
The greater scheme of things,

2964
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,570
your fucking ears are insignificant.

2965
01:25:08,571 --> 01:25:09,290
How about that?

2966
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:11,030
Your nose is insignificant to.

2967
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:13,730
Who cares if you smell farts in
the greater scheme of the universe?

2968
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:14,680
God,

2969
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,880
this is exactly what
we were talking about.

2970
01:25:16,881 --> 01:25:20,930
It's amazing when you
talk about something,

2971
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:24,350
you mock it and then someone misconstrues.

2972
01:25:24,351 --> 01:25:27,590
It's so badly that they literally
become what you're mocking.

2973
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:28,250
It's,

2974
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:28,611
but it's.

2975
01:25:28,611 --> 01:25:32,000
It's amazing to me because I usually have
to wait at least like for the video to

2976
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:32,420
post,

2977
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,490
so I love that it's happening
in real time for you.

2978
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:34,941
Yeah,

2979
01:25:34,941 --> 01:25:35,240
that's.

2980
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:35,421
Well,

2981
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:36,440
that's the beauty of it

2982
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:37,540
being on ustream.

2983
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:38,403
It's hilarious.

2984
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:40,900
People are looking to be upset.

2985
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:41,171
I mean,

2986
01:25:41,171 --> 01:25:42,880
we are in a strange time now.

2987
01:25:42,881 --> 01:25:44,320
We're a hundred Pakistani.

2988
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:46,330
Kids were murdered the other day.

2989
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:50,560
We have what's going on in Ferguson
where there's constant rioting.

2990
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:54,250
We have all this crazy shit
that's every fucking day.

2991
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:57,670
There's some new video of a cop
beating the fuck out of somebody.

2992
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
We have horrific injustice all over the
world and people are getting upset about

2993
01:26:03,321 --> 01:26:04,250
a conversation

2994
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,380
involving robot fuck towels.

2995
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,133
You know,

2996
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,480
sexism,

2997
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:10,551
sexism,

2998
01:26:10,551 --> 01:26:11,331
a real problem.

2999
01:26:11,331 --> 01:26:16,331
No Man would ever freak out that much
about a woman talking about robot.

3000
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:18,170
Fuck men,

3001
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,670
and that is true.

3002
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:21,650
If they would,

3003
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:21,890
they.

3004
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:25,010
They need to give up
their men colored cars.

3005
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,000
They're bitches.

3006
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:27,900
I said,

3007
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:28,733
picture,

3008
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,440
I'm just going to the rest
of this entire podcast.

3009
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:32,660
I'm just going to be
looking at your twitter.

3010
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:33,561
Don't do it,

3011
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:33,811
dude.

3012
01:26:33,811 --> 01:26:34,644
Don't do it

3013
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:35,170
sick.

3014
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:35,950
It's toxic.

3015
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:38,560
It's filled with toxic
masculinity at twitter.

3016
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:43,780
Men's rights associations bother
me way more than feminism tell.

3017
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:44,710
I'll tell you that right now.

3018
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:48,040
I think that's more ridiculous
because men's rights,

3019
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:53,280
I think the only time it's valid at
all is involving divorce and children.

3020
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:53,861
That's it.

3021
01:26:53,861 --> 01:26:54,220
Okay.

3022
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:55,210
Divorce and custody.

3023
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,590
Women's rights,

3024
01:26:56,890 --> 01:26:59,230
like women are way more,

3025
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,170
way more diminished by society.

3026
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:06,070
Way more marginalized
by culture than men are.

3027
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,440
It's like when you have a
men's rights association,

3028
01:27:08,441 --> 01:27:11,570
like really like how much
more do you need to control?

3029
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:13,630
Like men make way more money.

3030
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,020
They,

3031
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:14,390
they,

3032
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,420
they're in the positions of power,

3033
01:27:16,421 --> 01:27:17,800
like as far as like government,

3034
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:22,360
they're way more represented when it
comes to like ceos when it comes to like

3035
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:23,441
head of industry.

3036
01:27:23,441 --> 01:27:26,710
They're way more represented
like men's rights really.

3037
01:27:26,711 --> 01:27:27,270
Like what,

3038
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:27,500
what,

3039
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,660
what rights are we missing?

3040
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:30,640
The only ones there like divorce loss,

3041
01:27:30,641 --> 01:27:31,450
but I mean that's it.

3042
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:32,270
That's an example,

3043
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:34,850
a perfect example of the
extremes of both sides,

3044
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:35,180
right?

3045
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:39,720
Because it's something that comes
from a really valid discussion from,

3046
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:40,830
from like I,

3047
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:42,500
it's not like when I say feminist,

3048
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:44,540
I think of people that
talk about equality,

3049
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,220
but then there's this whole other level,

3050
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:46,570
right?

3051
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:48,110
That goes almost into,

3052
01:27:48,111 --> 01:27:53,111
into hating and attacking a giant group
rather than the bad parts of men are the

3053
01:27:55,401 --> 01:27:59,570
bad groups of men and so then he just
have all these people in the middle going,

3054
01:27:59,600 --> 01:27:59,811
ah,

3055
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:00,570
shit.

3056
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:00,950
Yeah.

3057
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,020
I don't want to talk.

3058
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,501
Yeah,

3059
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:04,191
that's what it is.

3060
01:28:04,191 --> 01:28:05,570
It's like when you don't want to be.

3061
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:08,060
I didn't even know what an MRA was.

3062
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,510
Somebody called me an Mra on twitter.

3063
01:28:10,511 --> 01:28:10,671
I'm like,

3064
01:28:10,671 --> 01:28:11,121
what the fuck?

3065
01:28:11,121 --> 01:28:13,040
Was that a meal replacement
or something like that.

3066
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:14,540
I didn't know what an MRI was,

3067
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:16,950
so I had to google it and I'm like men's,

3068
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:18,500
but then I thought about it like,

3069
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:18,891
wait a minute,

3070
01:28:18,891 --> 01:28:21,290
a men's rights advocate as a bad thing.

3071
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:25,100
Like someone who is a feminist was
mocking me for being an Mra and I'm like,

3072
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:25,380
oh,

3073
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,870
that seems kind of fucked.

3074
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,500
Like you're you.

3075
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:32,930
You were specifically identifying
on your twitter handle.

3076
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:34,460
You look at their page,

3077
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,331
feminist,

3078
01:28:35,331 --> 01:28:36,320
Hashtag feminist.

3079
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:41,450
You are identifying with
support for the female gender,

3080
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:46,190
but you're mocking someone by
using this as a pejorative,

3081
01:28:46,191 --> 01:28:51,191
like using men's rights advocate
as a negative statement.

3082
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:51,650
Right.

3083
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:52,990
That's kind of hilarious thing.

3084
01:28:52,991 --> 01:28:54,080
Seems quite hypocritical.

3085
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:55,550
The thing you have to be scared of though,

3086
01:28:55,551 --> 01:28:55,791
right?

3087
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:59,690
There are so many just troll accounts
that are meant to stir up the conversation

3088
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:03,820
and like that's when I'm like reporting
on stuff and I'm taking stuff from,

3089
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,130
from the Internet and twitter.

3090
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:09,900
It's so hard to tell because some
of the people that are crazy,

3091
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:10,261
crazy,

3092
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:12,600
silly people say the
same stuff as the trolls.

3093
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:13,973
I don't know.

3094
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:14,843
Are you being serious?

3095
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:15,381
Well,

3096
01:29:15,381 --> 01:29:15,951
it's also.

3097
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:18,500
It's funny because a lot
of people that do it,

3098
01:29:18,501 --> 01:29:22,910
they do it just to get everybody
freaked out and then people who are like

3099
01:29:22,911 --> 01:29:23,840
serious about it,

3100
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:26,540
start taking them and
using them as an example.

3101
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:26,870
I go,

3102
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:27,171
yeah,

3103
01:29:27,171 --> 01:29:28,004
he's right and like,

3104
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:28,281
no,

3105
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:28,461
no,

3106
01:29:28,461 --> 01:29:29,300
and we're not right.

3107
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,560
We're fucking around here.

3108
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:35,420
Like there's a lot of people
online that are trolls,

3109
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:38,810
meaning that they literally
are just for sport,

3110
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,570
trying to rile folks up
there just for sport.

3111
01:29:41,571 --> 01:29:45,110
They're trying to push buttons and get
people route and that's another new

3112
01:29:45,111 --> 01:29:47,510
reality that we're faced
with with the Internet,

3113
01:29:47,511 --> 01:29:49,010
like youtube comments,

3114
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:54,610
how youtube comments are just literally
designed to fuck with Philip DEFRANCO's

3115
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:55,070
head.

3116
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:55,491
Oh Man.

3117
01:29:55,491 --> 01:29:57,590
How many times I've seen your comments.

3118
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:58,463
I've had to go.

3119
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:01,170
I think I made something this
week where I was just like,

3120
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:05,310
I know that 80 percent of the people
that watch this do not leave comments or

3121
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:05,850
anything.

3122
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:09,000
Just say what's up because everyone
assumes the community is all awesome.

3123
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:12,780
Twenty percent suck like 20 percent of
the worst people in the world and all it

3124
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:14,340
takes is 200.

3125
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:17,040
Have some people that agree with something
and some people that just want to

3126
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:20,370
fuck with me to get like that
stupid ass comment on the front,

3127
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,241
on the front page,

3128
01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:23,420
at the top comment and I just
see it and I'm like I don't,

3129
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:27,060
I don't want to do this anymore
because I fucking hate you.

3130
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:28,680
I hate you so much.

3131
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,240
And then and then and then
people that don't know it's,

3132
01:30:32,241 --> 01:30:32,850
it's.

3133
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:36,060
But at the end of the day you realize
that it doesn't fucking matter at all,

3134
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:40,140
but it's amazing that a very small
number like say if your videos,

3135
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:42,330
like some of your videos have
like more than a million hits,

3136
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:42,681
right?

3137
01:30:42,681 --> 01:30:42,900
Yeah.

3138
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:43,200
Some,

3139
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,560
I think these days that they
average around half a mil.

3140
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:46,041
Okay.

3141
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:46,801
So think about that.

3142
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:47,634
That's fine.

3143
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:49,730
Hundred thousand fucking hits.

3144
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:52,910
I don't know how many people
that is because I'm sure
some of them watch it more

3145
01:30:52,911 --> 01:30:53,400
than once,

3146
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,300
but let's say it's 300,000 people.

3147
01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:01,540
All it takes is 10 unbelievable Douche
bags to get on that comment section and

3148
01:31:01,911 --> 01:31:02,900
just start pounding.

3149
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:03,700
He,

3150
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,533
uh,

3151
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:05,870
Nah.

3152
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:08,090
And then you have this fuck fest,

3153
01:31:08,091 --> 01:31:10,310
this clusterfuck in your comments.

3154
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:10,711
Yeah.

3155
01:31:10,711 --> 01:31:13,790
It's the best is when there are political
statements on videos that shouldn't,

3156
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,330
like,

3157
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:15,140
like it's like,

3158
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:15,973
uh,

3159
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:16,731
what was it the,

3160
01:31:16,731 --> 01:31:17,380
uh,

3161
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,640
the one where they were dumping
water on it with the ASL challenge,

3162
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:20,330
right?

3163
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:23,600
Just like you would look and then it
would be like some huge commentary about

3164
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:25,670
how Obama was a communist
and you're just like,

3165
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:29,570
why do I hope that was like a copy
paste and you didn't see this video and

3166
01:31:29,571 --> 01:31:29,871
you're like,

3167
01:31:29,871 --> 01:31:33,410
I'm inspired and just start
fucking type in Obama's.

3168
01:31:33,411 --> 01:31:33,720
Yeah,

3169
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,130
communism,

3170
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:37,910
Marxism moments in those terms
that people love to toss around.

3171
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:39,423
You know,

3172
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,353
it's uh,

3173
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:40,690
we,

3174
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:44,450
we live in amazing times in so many ways,

3175
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:45,700
but also the,

3176
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:47,360
the ability to reach people.

3177
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,650
So it's.

3178
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:48,870
So,

3179
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:49,051
it's,

3180
01:31:49,051 --> 01:31:49,884
so,

3181
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,220
it's so everyone is so accessible.

3182
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:52,730
It's,

3183
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:57,730
it's magical in a way that it's
exposing all these weird aspects,

3184
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:02,530
human interaction and human behavior
in a way that's never happened before

3185
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:04,480
because you're not actually
talking to someone,

3186
01:32:04,481 --> 01:32:05,314
you're not in front of them.

3187
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:08,590
Like if you said something and
someone responded to it and said,

3188
01:32:08,591 --> 01:32:08,861
well,

3189
01:32:08,861 --> 01:32:09,280
you know,

3190
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,050
I think that's offensive
and you'd be like,

3191
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:12,290
I'm not really Siri.

3192
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:13,420
I'm kind of fucking around,

3193
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:14,254
but you know,

3194
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:16,000
I see what you're saying.

3195
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:16,810
I see.

3196
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:19,390
Like you could see like if
somebody's really meant it,

3197
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:19,541
yeah,

3198
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:20,470
that would be offensive,

3199
01:32:20,471 --> 01:32:21,304
but you know,

3200
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,880
the way to be funny is to actually
goofed around and then you would have a

3201
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:28,030
conversation with them and you probably
come to some sort of an understanding,

3202
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:29,350
but that's what people do.

3203
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:29,860
You,

3204
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:30,641
you say something,

3205
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:31,421
I say something,

3206
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,640
but when someone wants to
write something about you,

3207
01:32:33,641 --> 01:32:35,830
whether it's a tumbler blog or
something along those lines,

3208
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,810
they're not interacting with you.

3209
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,370
They're just spewing,

3210
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,840
you know all around.

3211
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:41,130
Yeah.

3212
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:41,560
Yeah.

3213
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:42,101
And they're,

3214
01:32:42,101 --> 01:32:45,790
they're spewing out these words and
they're having this reaction where that

3215
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:50,050
would be a completely different
reaction if they actually talk to you.

3216
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:51,071
You know,

3217
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:55,450
and in that way it's an unbelievably
ineffective way of communicating.

3218
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:58,660
It's very self indulgent like to,

3219
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:58,851
to,

3220
01:32:58,851 --> 01:33:02,350
to go off on Tumbler
rants or twitter rants.

3221
01:33:02,351 --> 01:33:03,940
Like it's a very self
indulgent in that way.

3222
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:04,831
Oh definitely.

3223
01:33:04,831 --> 01:33:07,020
But whenever I look at
that or anything in life,

3224
01:33:07,021 --> 01:33:10,020
I kind of wonder like does
the good outweigh the bad?

3225
01:33:10,021 --> 01:33:11,160
And I think 100 percent it does,

3226
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:12,900
like there's way more good.

3227
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:13,601
Oh yeah.

3228
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:14,434
Most certainly.

3229
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:14,800
Yeah.

3230
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,060
I mean the band is kind of funny,

3231
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:18,070
you know there's,

3232
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,920
there's certainly bad
in terms of harassment,

3233
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:23,140
harassment aspect is this,

3234
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,470
that's the creepiest scariest because

3235
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:32,830
especially when it comes to some of the
evil fucking violent death threats and

3236
01:33:32,831 --> 01:33:37,240
shit that some people and almost most
of it teams to go towards women and it's

3237
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:38,050
just these,

3238
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:40,660
there's a lot of men out
there that are just not,

3239
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:44,200
they're not deemed attractive to women.

3240
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:45,300
They're not there,

3241
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:49,480
they're not desirable by women and
they've lived their life in this really

3242
01:33:49,481 --> 01:33:51,220
resentful state.

3243
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,410
This like this painful state.

3244
01:33:53,411 --> 01:33:57,130
Like if you're a guy and you're going
through life and you're constantly being

3245
01:33:57,131 --> 01:34:00,580
rejected and you're looking
at some high school jock,

3246
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:01,960
quarterback type dude,

3247
01:34:01,961 --> 01:34:04,930
it gets all the girls and you
just fucking fuming inside.

3248
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:07,510
You're angry and and you,

3249
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:08,350
you know,

3250
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:12,910
you live your life like this and then
you have this outlet of expressing

3251
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:16,240
yourself and then you see some woman
and for whatever reason you've developed

3252
01:34:16,241 --> 01:34:16,630
this.

3253
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:21,520
I know guys because of
the fact that they've been
rejected by women for so long.

3254
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:26,730
They associate women with pain because
they associate women with rejecting them

3255
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:31,960
or with hating them and they
get angry and they lash out.

3256
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:32,501
You know,

3257
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:33,334
they want,

3258
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:38,110
they want that woman to feel a part
of what they felt their whole life.

3259
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:38,690
That's.

3260
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:38,931
See,

3261
01:34:38,931 --> 01:34:40,520
that's fucking terrifying.

3262
01:34:40,521 --> 01:34:40,940
There was,

3263
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:41,630
there was that,

3264
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:45,080
there was that kid that shot
up all those people at that,

3265
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:46,520
a college party.

3266
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,520
I think it was like earlier
in the year or late last year,

3267
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,420
and he had the,

3268
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:53,510
like the youtube video is where he was
talking about he was going to make women

3269
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,790
pay Santa Barbara,

3270
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:56,060
right?

3271
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:56,361
Yeah.

3272
01:34:56,361 --> 01:34:57,800
The number of that

3273
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,873
were like,

3274
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,241
yeah,

3275
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:00,074
it's women's fault.

3276
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,520
That's what.

3277
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,301
That's.

3278
01:35:02,301 --> 01:35:02,451
Well,

3279
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:05,750
that's the men's rights guys
in the pickup artist guys,

3280
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:09,560
there was a lot of these pickup
artists guys were saying like,

3281
01:35:09,561 --> 01:35:14,240
if these women weren't so stuck
up and if they weren't so prudish,

3282
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,790
like this guy would have gotten laid
and this would've never happened.

3283
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:18,290
Like that's crazy.

3284
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,153
That's crazy.

3285
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:22,010
You're dealing with a mental
health issue for sure.

3286
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:23,000
One hundred percent.

3287
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,910
Like to blame this in some way on,

3288
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:26,550
you know,

3289
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:29,150
that this could have been
cured with promiscuity.

3290
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:30,560
Fucking bizarre.

3291
01:35:30,561 --> 01:35:32,060
Like that level of victim blaming.

3292
01:35:32,061 --> 01:35:33,050
That's what blows my mind.

3293
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:33,860
Yes.

3294
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:34,730
That blows my mind.

3295
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:35,241
Yeah,

3296
01:35:35,241 --> 01:35:36,380
that's fucking crazy.

3297
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:37,100
That's just.

3298
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:39,560
I mean that's just insane.

3299
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:40,430
And that's also,

3300
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,750
that's also like being around
too many likeminded psychos.

3301
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:48,010
Like there's those groups
they get together and they,

3302
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:52,970
they like sort of like reaffirm each
other's ridiculous notions and then they

3303
01:35:52,971 --> 01:35:55,610
feed off of each other and
then they start attacking,

3304
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:56,241
you know,

3305
01:35:56,241 --> 01:35:59,780
and then they start making those little
egg fake twitter councils toss away

3306
01:35:59,781 --> 01:36:02,420
accounts and just talking
mad shit to people.

3307
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:03,680
Yeah.

3308
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:04,220
I mean,

3309
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:06,110
I think in the future you're
not gonna be able to do that.

3310
01:36:06,111 --> 01:36:08,870
I think one of the things that's a problem
with things like twitter is that you

3311
01:36:08,871 --> 01:36:10,070
can be anonymous,

3312
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:10,760
you know?

3313
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:14,480
Do you think that being
anonymous is completely bad?

3314
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:15,580
No,

3315
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:17,240
because I mean because I think it's gray.

3316
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:17,641
I mean,

3317
01:36:17,641 --> 01:36:17,731
I,

3318
01:36:17,731 --> 01:36:18,441
I think it is great.

3319
01:36:18,441 --> 01:36:18,711
Rather,

3320
01:36:18,711 --> 01:36:19,820
I don't think it's black and white.

3321
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:20,721
Sometimes.

3322
01:36:20,721 --> 01:36:24,890
I think you can express yourself
in an anonymous way honestly.

3323
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,570
Whereas if it was your own name,

3324
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,160
like if you wanted a tweet something
about a movie and you're like,

3325
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:31,401
man,

3326
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:33,020
I don't want these people to be mad at me,

3327
01:36:33,021 --> 01:36:37,370
but this was the most fucking pedestrian
piece of shit film I've ever seen in my

3328
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:37,521
life.

3329
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:38,354
Holy fucking.

3330
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,980
How did this guy ever get a job?

3331
01:36:39,981 --> 01:36:40,910
Who fucking wrote this?

3332
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:41,930
You're like,

3333
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:42,680
I don't want to do that.

3334
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:43,970
But that's how you really feel.

3335
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,300
Yeah,

3336
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:44,960
it's.

3337
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:45,621
But that's the thing,

3338
01:36:45,621 --> 01:36:45,831
right?

3339
01:36:45,831 --> 01:36:46,551
So being anonymous,

3340
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:47,660
you can go and you can go,

3341
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:48,321
hey joe Rogan,

3342
01:36:48,321 --> 01:36:49,040
fuck yourself.

3343
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,390
But you can also,

3344
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:51,373
um,

3345
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,060
get the word out slash criticized.

3346
01:36:53,061 --> 01:36:54,470
Maybe like a really bad professor.

3347
01:36:54,471 --> 01:36:54,851
You can,

3348
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:55,160
um,

3349
01:36:55,160 --> 01:37:00,160
you can get something out about someone
without the real life ramifications if

3350
01:37:00,291 --> 01:37:00,650
you,

3351
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:01,850
if you did something else.

3352
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:02,660
So that's.

3353
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:05,480
And that's one of those things where
I think that being an honest on the

3354
01:37:05,481 --> 01:37:07,310
internet overall,

3355
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:09,410
I think the good outweighs
the bad at this point.

3356
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:10,670
Yeah.

3357
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:10,941
Yeah.

3358
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:12,320
I think the good
outweighs the bad as well.

3359
01:37:12,321 --> 01:37:13,910
I think essentially,

3360
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:15,830
like I said about youtube comments,

3361
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:20,831
like you could have 10 people in 500,000
that attack your comments section and

3362
01:37:21,111 --> 01:37:22,910
ruin the whole fucking thing easily,

3363
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:23,511
you know,

3364
01:37:23,511 --> 01:37:28,010
especially if they continue to post
and continue to do it and that's,

3365
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:28,640
you know,

3366
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:32,340
overall 500,000 people are watching
it or whatever and you know,

3367
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:33,650
10 get upset,

3368
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:34,880
it balances out.

3369
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:37,880
The information is not changing.

3370
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,680
Your video is not changing,

3371
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:40,461
you know,

3372
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:44,840
and if you get a certain amount of
negative responses on twitter or a certain

3373
01:37:44,841 --> 01:37:48,500
amount of people that get angry at you,

3374
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:50,240
ultimately the,

3375
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:55,230
the unique ability to express herself
that we experienced today is way more

3376
01:37:55,231 --> 01:37:56,130
positive than

3377
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:56,963
it is negative.

3378
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:57,421
Oh yeah,

3379
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:57,841
definitely.

3380
01:37:57,841 --> 01:37:58,650
I mean,

3381
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:02,610
over the course of doing the show because
there's so much valid conversation and

3382
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:04,470
we also banned the hell out of trolls.

3383
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:05,600
I'm like,

3384
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:06,331
we've had,

3385
01:38:06,331 --> 01:38:09,030
I feel like good conversations
about capital punishment,

3386
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:09,390
you know,

3387
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:13,020
like my opinion has constantly changed
on whether we should have that.

3388
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:14,220
Like that should be a thing.

3389
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,700
And I mean we talked about
it on the show today.

3390
01:38:17,701 --> 01:38:18,421
That was the other one.

3391
01:38:18,421 --> 01:38:18,781
The uh,

3392
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:23,760
there's a 14 year old kid are like 70
years ago he was convicted of murder in

3393
01:38:23,761 --> 01:38:25,690
South Carolina and they
killed him like he was,

3394
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:26,880
he was a 14 year old boy.

3395
01:38:26,881 --> 01:38:28,110
Had to put them on a,

3396
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:28,770
uh,

3397
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:30,420
on a phone book so they
could electrocute him.

3398
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:31,733
And,

3399
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:33,210
and then you look at the numbers.

3400
01:38:33,211 --> 01:38:33,651
We,

3401
01:38:33,651 --> 01:38:34,020
I think it was,

3402
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:35,390
we killed the,

3403
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,820
the smallest number of people in 20 years.

3404
01:38:38,821 --> 01:38:42,210
We sentenced the smallest number
of people to death this year.

3405
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:43,080
Um,

3406
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:43,561
and I don't know,

3407
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:43,930
it's,

3408
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:46,440
it's a good conversation most of the time.

3409
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:47,510
Yeah.

3410
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:48,470
As a father,

3411
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:50,220
one of the things that you realize,

3412
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:56,070
one of the things that's happened to me
is that I've become way more kind and

3413
01:38:56,570 --> 01:39:01,450
way more forgiving of people's
circumstances and behavior because I,

3414
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,931
first of all,

3415
01:39:02,931 --> 01:39:04,370
I really Sam Harris,

3416
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:09,400
who was on the podcast and he started
talking to me about determinism and he was

3417
01:39:09,471 --> 01:39:14,050
talking about the idea of free
will and determinism determinism,

3418
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:16,130
the idea of your life experiences,

3419
01:39:16,131 --> 01:39:16,964
your genetics,

3420
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:19,700
everything that you've gone through
in your life is essentially what makes

3421
01:39:19,701 --> 01:39:22,240
Philip to Franco in 2014 on December.

3422
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:23,270
Whatever the fuck the day is.

3423
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:24,510
You know what I mean like that.

3424
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:27,560
That is who you are and you.

3425
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:32,800
This idea of free will becomes very cloudy
because essentially you are this huge

3426
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:40,220
accumulation of experiences and
genetics and all these different things.

3427
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:40,911
Well,

3428
01:39:40,911 --> 01:39:41,990
when you become a parent,

3429
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,510
at least I've the way I've experienced,

3430
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:46,820
I look at people very differently
now because I don't look,

3431
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:46,950
oh,

3432
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:48,230
there's that guy is a fuck up.

3433
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:48,651
Oh,

3434
01:39:48,651 --> 01:39:49,520
this guy's a loser.

3435
01:39:49,730 --> 01:39:50,810
I don't look at it that way.

3436
01:39:50,811 --> 01:39:53,450
I look at it like that was a baby.

3437
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:54,020
Okay.

3438
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:58,310
That was a baby that was raised in
some probably unbelievably abusive

3439
01:39:58,311 --> 01:40:03,070
environment and they became this
complete fucking idiot and 30,

3440
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:03,560
right,

3441
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:03,891
you know,

3442
01:40:03,891 --> 01:40:08,891
and most likely a large majority of how
they became that person is not because

3443
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:11,510
of their own actions.

3444
01:40:11,511 --> 01:40:15,060
It's because of the way they were raised
and because of the circumstances that

3445
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:17,270
they found themselves in
just completely by chance.

3446
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:20,960
And I look at serial killers that way.

3447
01:40:20,961 --> 01:40:22,040
Now I look at,

3448
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:23,203
I look at,

3449
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:24,103
you know,

3450
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:25,790
negative people,

3451
01:40:25,791 --> 01:40:27,650
male and female in that way.

3452
01:40:27,651 --> 01:40:32,651
I just think a lot of what we're dealing
with in our culture is people that

3453
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:33,260
they,

3454
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:37,580
they've been raised in an insanely
shitty way by people didn't know what the

3455
01:40:37,581 --> 01:40:38,420
fuck they were doing.

3456
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,430
They've had a bunch of
horrible things happen to them.

3457
01:40:40,431 --> 01:40:43,400
They had bad circumstances and
this is the result of that.

3458
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:45,020
But at what point do you just,

3459
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:45,800
is that,

3460
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:49,010
is that a cop out and you don't hold
people accountable for their actions?

3461
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:51,230
That's the big question there was,

3462
01:40:51,231 --> 01:40:52,064
there was the,

3463
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:53,580
the young was like,

3464
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:55,450
I feel like he was 16 from a really,

3465
01:40:55,451 --> 01:40:56,890
really rich family in Texas.

3466
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:57,993
And uh,

3467
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:00,430
he and a bunch of guys
that were under age,

3468
01:41:00,530 --> 01:41:01,510
they got,

3469
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:03,640
they took a dad's car and got really,

3470
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:04,151
really drunk,

3471
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:04,960
drove a,

3472
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,360
ended up killing a bunch
of people and he ended up,

3473
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:12,361
I think not doing any time in jail because
they argued that because he was from

3474
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:13,600
a rich family,

3475
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:14,350
uh,

3476
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:14,890
that,

3477
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:18,100
that he didn't understand
consequences for actions.

3478
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:19,000
Like that's,

3479
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:19,930
that's crazy.

3480
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:20,780
That's,

3481
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:22,750
I think you have to.

3482
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:24,850
What's the point of rules?

3483
01:41:24,851 --> 01:41:25,684
If we go,

3484
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:29,110
he's had too easy of a life or
he's had too hard of a life.

3485
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:31,030
I think that you can make changes.

3486
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:34,030
Like don't don't put people
that smoke weed in prison.

3487
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:35,070
But,

3488
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:36,850
but what about these violent criminals?

3489
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:41,870
There's also a problem in that when
human beings get to a certain point,

3490
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:44,120
is there a way you can fix them?

3491
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:44,850
Oh,

3492
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:48,080
like a guy like a Ted Bundy,

3493
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:48,470
right?

3494
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:49,610
You can't fix that guy.

3495
01:41:49,611 --> 01:41:51,440
Like when they reach a certain point,

3496
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:53,690
like you have to remove them from society.

3497
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:54,350
You got to kill him.

3498
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:56,630
He's deriving pleasure at a killing women.

3499
01:41:56,631 --> 01:41:57,650
What are we going to fix him?

3500
01:41:57,651 --> 01:42:00,650
And then trust that we can release them
out in the public and he's not going to

3501
01:42:00,651 --> 01:42:02,180
go kill a bunch of more women.

3502
01:42:02,181 --> 01:42:02,391
No,

3503
01:42:02,391 --> 01:42:02,931
you can't.

3504
01:42:02,931 --> 01:42:03,764
You can't.

3505
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:08,800
There's a certain point of no return where
human beings reach and it always that

3506
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:13,420
that point of no return always involves
victimizing other people as soon as the

3507
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:16,640
they hurt people or kill.

3508
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:17,570
Okay.

3509
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:19,820
Without death or violence.

3510
01:42:20,030 --> 01:42:20,990
Bernie maydoff,

3511
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:21,830
okay,

3512
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:23,750
how much money can you steal?

3513
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,700
How many lives can you ruin?

3514
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:28,160
How many financial
futures can you destroy?

3515
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:32,180
And we still let you go back into
society and be a free person.

3516
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:33,071
I mean,

3517
01:42:33,071 --> 01:42:34,630
there is also the question of in America,

3518
01:42:34,631 --> 01:42:37,750
I think the thought of
rehabilitation is not there,

3519
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:38,980
at least with our prison systems.

3520
01:42:38,981 --> 01:42:40,080
I don't know if it's because it's,

3521
01:42:40,081 --> 01:42:44,800
it's a moneymaker or it's just we just
want what we consider monsters away from

3522
01:42:44,801 --> 01:42:45,150
us,

3523
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:46,670
but don't really rehabilitate.

3524
01:42:46,730 --> 01:42:47,150
No,

3525
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:48,770
we don't do anything with the mind.

3526
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:49,020
Right?

3527
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:49,360
I mean,

3528
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,740
it's not like we take these
people and we give them Mtma.

3529
01:42:51,741 --> 01:42:53,600
We put them on Iowasca retreats.

3530
01:42:53,601 --> 01:42:57,650
We try to connect them to
their spiritual mother spirit.

3531
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,160
You know,

3532
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,060
we wouldn't know.

3533
01:42:59,061 --> 01:43:03,740
We put them in a jail cell and surround
them with fucking psychos and then leave

3534
01:43:03,741 --> 01:43:06,860
them there for 10 years and hope they get
better because they feel bad that they

3535
01:43:06,861 --> 01:43:09,230
had to live in this shitty
circumstances for 10 years.

3536
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:10,760
That doesn't fix anybody,

3537
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:11,540
right?

3538
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:12,111
Then you jump,

3539
01:43:12,111 --> 01:43:12,351
right?

3540
01:43:12,351 --> 01:43:15,470
So the whole point of like when I cover
things as jumping to the other side,

3541
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,910
the other side would then argue,

3542
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:19,730
what are you going to
fucking caudal murderers?

3543
01:43:19,731 --> 01:43:21,440
Are you going to coddle pedophiles?

3544
01:43:21,441 --> 01:43:22,274
Are you going to,

3545
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:24,170
are you going to punish people?

3546
01:43:24,171 --> 01:43:25,940
Because I think as Americans,

3547
01:43:25,970 --> 01:43:26,571
for the most part,

3548
01:43:26,571 --> 01:43:28,460
we think of prison as punishment.

3549
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:30,140
You fucked up,

3550
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:34,010
we're gonna fuck you up
rather than you messed up.

3551
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:37,010
We want you to be a member of
society that is productive.

3552
01:43:37,011 --> 01:43:40,550
So here are classes and here's how
you can learn and hear his therapy.

3553
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,470
And once again I'm in A.

3554
01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:46,930
I'm in the gray area because
there's like the fucking kid that,

3555
01:43:46,931 --> 01:43:48,830
that bombed the Boston bombing.

3556
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:50,330
Like kill that kid.

3557
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:51,680
That's mindset,

3558
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,843
right?

3559
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:53,170
And,

3560
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:53,870
and it's these,

3561
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:55,280
it's these mass outliers,

3562
01:43:55,281 --> 01:43:55,431
right?

3563
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:59,240
These outlier situations that ended
up changing my mind on when the Norway

3564
01:43:59,241 --> 01:44:00,074
shooter happened,

3565
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:00,440
you know,

3566
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:01,520
it's like you go,

3567
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:02,090
how did that,

3568
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:02,930
they don't kill that guy,

3569
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:03,750
you know?

3570
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:04,760
And so that's,

3571
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:05,050
it's,

3572
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:09,080
it's me constantly dealing with it myself
and talking to the people that aren't

3573
01:44:09,081 --> 01:44:13,580
assholes online and trying to formulate
it and evolve my opinion on it.

3574
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:14,550
Yeah.

3575
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:18,480
And I think also with
really complex situations,

3576
01:44:18,481 --> 01:44:20,640
there is no black and white.

3577
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:23,760
There's no right and wrong and yeah,

3578
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:27,120
we kind of have to punish people
when they do horrible things.

3579
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,530
But again,

3580
01:44:28,531 --> 01:44:29,400
as a parent,

3581
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:32,070
as a person who's watching
human beings develop,

3582
01:44:32,490 --> 01:44:37,490
I'm realizing that a lot of the problem
that we have in our culture is that some

3583
01:44:37,741 --> 01:44:38,970
kids don't get a chance.

3584
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:39,960
They just don't.

3585
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,310
They,

3586
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:40,630
they,

3587
01:44:40,630 --> 01:44:41,010
they're,

3588
01:44:41,010 --> 01:44:45,450
they're in bad situations from the
jump and they are the product of their

3589
01:44:45,451 --> 01:44:48,810
environment and some of them
make it through horrible,

3590
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:51,060
horrible neighborhoods,

3591
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,350
bad situations.

3592
01:44:52,351 --> 01:44:55,380
They become stronger and better and
have more character because of it.

3593
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:56,940
But we shouldn't expect that.

3594
01:44:57,030 --> 01:44:58,990
We shouldn't force them to,

3595
01:44:59,010 --> 01:44:59,270
you know,

3596
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:01,770
to be as good as the best
people in their neighborhood.

3597
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:04,710
Like everybody's circumstances
very different and I always say,

3598
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:07,740
this is the way I've been thinking lately.

3599
01:45:07,950 --> 01:45:10,080
If you lived someone's life,

3600
01:45:10,170 --> 01:45:11,490
you would be that person.

3601
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:12,451
You know you,

3602
01:45:12,451 --> 01:45:13,740
you would be,

3603
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:14,371
you know,

3604
01:45:14,371 --> 01:45:15,181
fill in the blanks,

3605
01:45:15,181 --> 01:45:16,014
ray rice,

3606
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:16,450
you know,

3607
01:45:16,450 --> 01:45:16,800
if you,

3608
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,850
if you live that guy's life and found
yourself in that elevator with your

3609
01:45:20,851 --> 01:45:22,590
girlfriend and punched her in the face,

3610
01:45:22,830 --> 01:45:23,340
you're,

3611
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,020
you're him.

3612
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:26,580
You were that guy that
is possible to become.

3613
01:45:26,581 --> 01:45:29,670
That person should be punished
him abso-fucking-lutely,

3614
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:34,680
but should we also recognize that you
become a god that's willing to hit a

3615
01:45:34,681 --> 01:45:36,180
person or hit a woman?

3616
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:41,330
You become a that through a
lot of different variables
through the way you were

3617
01:45:41,461 --> 01:45:42,180
raised,

3618
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:44,520
the type of people that
you communicated with,

3619
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:46,410
the type of relationship you're in.

3620
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:48,420
She is the wife hit him.

3621
01:45:48,690 --> 01:45:48,991
You know,

3622
01:45:48,991 --> 01:45:50,130
like they're hitting each other.

3623
01:45:50,131 --> 01:45:50,964
They do that.

3624
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,600
There's obviously there is some sort
of a abusive physical relationship.

3625
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:55,020
You know,

3626
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:55,251
I,

3627
01:45:55,251 --> 01:45:57,180
I'm pretty sure you're
not that kind of a guy.

3628
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:59,040
I'm definitely not that kind of a guy,

3629
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:03,840
but is it because you didn't grow up
that way if you grew up around a mom and

3630
01:46:03,841 --> 01:46:07,400
dad that beat the shit out of you and
your dad beat the shit out of your mom and

3631
01:46:07,401 --> 01:46:10,080
you beat the shit out of your girlfriends
and they beat the shit out of you.

3632
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:13,020
You're throwing shoes at each
other and duck and plates.

3633
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:16,430
Then you be that fucking
person I think maybe be

3634
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:19,780
right because like my mom
was nightmare growing up.

3635
01:46:19,781 --> 01:46:20,560
Like she's,

3636
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,780
she's done that thing
where as they get older,

3637
01:46:22,781 --> 01:46:23,480
like she,

3638
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:25,720
she became a nurse and she's
like taking care of people now.

3639
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:27,670
But like she beat the
fuck out of me sometimes.

3640
01:46:27,690 --> 01:46:29,110
Like just for no reason,

3641
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,700
like for no reason.

3642
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:32,110
It was like a bad day.

3643
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:33,180
Yeah.

3644
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:34,960
And it's not like it
happened all the time.

3645
01:46:34,961 --> 01:46:35,201
Right?

3646
01:46:35,201 --> 01:46:35,830
It's not,

3647
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:38,140
it's not the worst situation
that's ever happened.

3648
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:39,280
When I was growing up.

3649
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:40,363
My,

3650
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:44,890
my dad would use me to help steal stuff
from like Walmart so that we can bring

3651
01:46:44,891 --> 01:46:46,490
it back and we could get money like,

3652
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:49,770
so I didn't come from this
place where was just like,

3653
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,410
everything's easy and
everyone's on that open up,

3654
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:57,120
but I also don't do that now that I'm
an adult because I think I saw those

3655
01:46:57,121 --> 01:46:58,980
things and then I looked
outside and I was like,

3656
01:46:59,010 --> 01:46:59,131
oh,

3657
01:46:59,131 --> 01:46:59,880
that's fucked up.

3658
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,810
You don't do that.

3659
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:01,021
Like,

3660
01:47:01,021 --> 01:47:03,060
I'm never going to hit my wife.

3661
01:47:03,061 --> 01:47:05,430
I don't want my kid,

3662
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:06,540
you know?

3663
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:07,380
Like I said,

3664
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:08,101
never hit my wife,

3665
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:09,060
but I don't want to hit my.

3666
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:09,211
Well,

3667
01:47:09,211 --> 01:47:10,920
my dad's little motherfucker gets crazy.

3668
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:12,390
My Dad slapped me one time.

3669
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,670
I was like six years old and I said,

3670
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:15,331
fuck you.

3671
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:16,220
And he slapped me once.

3672
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:17,100
I'll never said it again.

3673
01:47:17,170 --> 01:47:19,790
I like how you said it
in a six year old tone.

3674
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:21,720
Oh Man,

3675
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:22,500
I'm waiting.

3676
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,880
I'm waiting for him to say fuck you.

3677
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:24,930
And I hate you.

3678
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:25,770
Ooh.

3679
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:26,603
Those were mean.

3680
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:27,720
That wasn't mean words,

3681
01:47:27,721 --> 01:47:28,501
but you know,

3682
01:47:28,501 --> 01:47:29,550
it's your responsibility to go,

3683
01:47:29,551 --> 01:47:29,851
no,

3684
01:47:29,851 --> 01:47:31,090
you don't relax.

3685
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:31,650
My Dad,

3686
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:32,940
when my dad would just,

3687
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:33,893
he would annoy me,

3688
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:34,321
he would just say,

3689
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:34,920
I ate you.

3690
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:35,211
He's like,

3691
01:47:35,211 --> 01:47:35,940
you ate me,

3692
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:38,480
and as six year old me just furious.

3693
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:40,033
Angry.

3694
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:41,671
Yeah.

3695
01:47:41,671 --> 01:47:43,020
My six year old gets mad if she,

3696
01:47:43,021 --> 01:47:45,270
if she pouts and starts
whining about things.

3697
01:47:45,271 --> 01:47:46,020
If I go,

3698
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:46,620
oh,

3699
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:48,160
someone whining,

3700
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:50,851
she'll freak out.

3701
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:51,210
I mean,

3702
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:52,440
it could be about nothing,

3703
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:53,353
you know?

3704
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:53,930
Yeah.

3705
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:54,920
She's a little human being.

3706
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:57,110
That's the thing about human beings.

3707
01:47:57,111 --> 01:47:57,440
I mean,

3708
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:02,440
there they are this just bundle of
potential and there's all these events and

3709
01:48:03,891 --> 01:48:06,710
variables that happen in your
life that create who you are.

3710
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:12,280
And I think that most human beings that
raise children really don't know what

3711
01:48:12,321 --> 01:48:16,790
they're getting into when they started
off and hopefully along the way they

3712
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:19,460
develop a better person than they were.

3713
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:20,030
You know,

3714
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:23,690
that they do a better job of parenting
based on the experiences that they've had

3715
01:48:23,691 --> 01:48:27,530
with their parents and the mistakes that
they're aware that their parents made

3716
01:48:27,531 --> 01:48:28,370
and hopefully we learn,

3717
01:48:28,371 --> 01:48:33,371
but we're still just learning the effects
of behavior and what it's like when

3718
01:48:34,581 --> 01:48:34,941
you raise.

3719
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:37,760
Kids were still learning that we're
still going over that and a lot of people

3720
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:38,391
are terrible at.

3721
01:48:38,391 --> 01:48:42,740
I watched some fucking unit yell
at her kid and pull him by the arm.

3722
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:45,530
It's screaming that he's going to
beat the tar out of him and I'm like,

3723
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,060
Oh fuck man,

3724
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:50,120
I'm watching some kid
be raised by a moron,

3725
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:50,571
you know,

3726
01:48:50,571 --> 01:48:52,670
and he's going to have
to unlearn all this shit.

3727
01:48:52,671 --> 01:48:53,960
This more is teaching them.

3728
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:54,973
And that's,

3729
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:55,880
you know,

3730
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:00,880
in some extreme situations like extreme
abuse and extreme neglect and extreme

3731
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:04,010
sexual abuse and violence,

3732
01:49:04,011 --> 01:49:04,221
you know,

3733
01:49:04,221 --> 01:49:07,430
you're going to develop a horrible
person that's dealt with these variables

3734
01:49:07,431 --> 01:49:08,250
their whole life.

3735
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:09,350
This is who they are,

3736
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:09,851
you know,

3737
01:49:09,851 --> 01:49:10,250
this is,

3738
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:10,701
this is the,

3739
01:49:10,701 --> 01:49:14,270
there are the product of all the things
that have happened to them and how

3740
01:49:14,271 --> 01:49:15,650
they've processed those things.

3741
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:16,770
But at the end of the day,

3742
01:49:17,010 --> 01:49:20,160
do you want that end
product next to your kid?

3743
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:20,510
No.

3744
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:21,010
No.

3745
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:21,160
See,

3746
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:21,993
but that's the thing is like,

3747
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:24,640
I wonder how that's fixable.

3748
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,780
I really don't.

3749
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:31,040
I don't know if there's a way to reset
the mind and some sort of a functional

3750
01:49:32,741 --> 01:49:37,741
way and it may be some sort
of a psychedelic thing or
it may be something that

3751
01:49:37,871 --> 01:49:40,920
has to do with neuroscience
in the future with a.

3752
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:45,550
They find out the issues of the human
brain and they can literally reprogram the

3753
01:49:45,551 --> 01:49:50,551
mind and some sort of way and get them
in in some unforeseen future technology,

3754
01:49:53,211 --> 01:49:58,211
some way to understand like
why they've become this person,

3755
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:00,190
why they are abusive,

3756
01:50:00,191 --> 01:50:02,800
why they are self destructive.

3757
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:05,980
Maybe someone who's a drug
addict who hates themselves.

3758
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:06,671
You find out,

3759
01:50:06,671 --> 01:50:06,791
oh,

3760
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:09,100
you really hate yourself
because your mother hated you.

3761
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:09,581
You know,

3762
01:50:09,581 --> 01:50:10,450
this is what it is.

3763
01:50:10,451 --> 01:50:15,451
Like you have this horrible reaction to
being raised by this awful person and we

3764
01:50:16,090 --> 01:50:17,370
found the core of it like,

3765
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:18,880
like you have an electrical problem.

3766
01:50:18,881 --> 01:50:19,091
Oh,

3767
01:50:19,091 --> 01:50:19,811
well here it is.

3768
01:50:19,811 --> 01:50:22,360
We found the wire has a slice in it.

3769
01:50:22,570 --> 01:50:23,360
It's getting,

3770
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:23,770
you know,

3771
01:50:23,770 --> 01:50:24,750
the water's getting in.

3772
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:25,840
It's shorting out.

3773
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:27,280
We'll just fix that wire.

3774
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:28,430
I mean,

3775
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:29,201
if people.

3776
01:50:29,201 --> 01:50:31,480
If we can get to that point at some,

3777
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:34,330
we can fix a lot of the
problems in society.

3778
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:34,911
Right,

3779
01:50:34,911 --> 01:50:35,601
but then who's to.

3780
01:50:35,601 --> 01:50:37,370
Who's to say what's right
and wrong at that point?

3781
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:39,550
Who's to say that you're broken.

3782
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:40,221
You're not like,

3783
01:50:40,221 --> 01:50:41,140
where is that?

3784
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:41,831
You do.

3785
01:50:41,831 --> 01:50:42,650
You take out the human,

3786
01:50:42,650 --> 01:50:43,970
essentially you're taking out the human,

3787
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,230
right?

3788
01:50:45,230 --> 01:50:45,840
Because it's.

3789
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:49,090
I mean at the end we kind of
our wires but kind not wires.

3790
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:50,630
Well then it comes back to the alien,

3791
01:50:50,631 --> 01:50:51,464
right?

3792
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:52,041
Always.

3793
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:53,960
That's the alien.

3794
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,720
Sexless muscle lists.

3795
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,160
Speechless.

3796
01:50:58,610 --> 01:50:59,910
You don't know if that dude,

3797
01:50:59,911 --> 01:51:00,591
if that alien,

3798
01:51:00,591 --> 01:51:01,351
it beats his wife.

3799
01:51:01,351 --> 01:51:02,320
You don't know he could.

3800
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,930
They beat anything.

3801
01:51:03,931 --> 01:51:04,830
They're so skinny.

3802
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:06,470
I think that get away with it.

3803
01:51:06,510 --> 01:51:07,500
Wife kick his ass.

3804
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:13,360
I had this guy on Zoltan Istvan who's
a futurist and he's one of those trans

3805
01:51:14,211 --> 01:51:15,510
humanism proponents.

3806
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:15,990
Okay.

3807
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:17,040
And Fascinating Guy,

3808
01:51:17,041 --> 01:51:21,870
but one of the things that he said is
that these people that have recently,

3809
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:23,880
I don't know if you're
aware of this technology,

3810
01:51:23,881 --> 01:51:28,881
that they've recently been
able to transmit words across
the Internet to someone

3811
01:51:29,161 --> 01:51:31,170
wearing a helmet like with no,

3812
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,030
with no words spoken.

3813
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:33,680
You,

3814
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:37,470
you think a word and
having this helmet on this,

3815
01:51:37,471 --> 01:51:42,471
this series of electrodes that attached
to your head that somehow understand the

3816
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:45,720
what part of your brain is firing up.

3817
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,490
When you think of a word like hello,

3818
01:51:47,570 --> 01:51:48,150
right before it.

3819
01:51:48,150 --> 01:51:48,690
Hello?

3820
01:51:48,690 --> 01:51:49,231
Hello.

3821
01:51:49,231 --> 01:51:51,690
Registers in some sort
of an area of your brain.

3822
01:51:51,870 --> 01:51:55,410
This person wears his helmet and
they hear hello in their mind.

3823
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:56,220
That's wild dam.

3824
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:56,521
Yes,

3825
01:51:56,521 --> 01:51:57,690
and they hear it through the Internet.

3826
01:51:57,870 --> 01:51:58,021
Well,

3827
01:51:58,021 --> 01:52:01,220
he said that they believe that this
technology over the next couple of decades

3828
01:52:01,230 --> 01:52:06,230
going to advance so fast and so strong
that we are going to lose communication

3829
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,670
like oral communication.

3830
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,770
We're going to speak directly,

3831
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,780
mind to mind from now on.

3832
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:12,981
Well,

3833
01:52:12,981 --> 01:52:13,760
I wonder if,

3834
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:16,370
because obviously it sounds
like they have someone go,

3835
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:16,821
okay,

3836
01:52:16,821 --> 01:52:18,860
think of apple 20 different times,

3837
01:52:18,861 --> 01:52:19,191
apple,

3838
01:52:19,191 --> 01:52:19,431
apple,

3839
01:52:19,431 --> 01:52:19,731
apple,

3840
01:52:19,731 --> 01:52:20,600
and then think of banana.

3841
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,670
Is it that big of a difference?

3842
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:25,700
Is it where are you gonna be able to
get all the small intricacies or is it

3843
01:52:25,701 --> 01:52:26,510
going to be like,

3844
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:28,070
this is anger.

3845
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:28,490
Like,

3846
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:29,230
ah,

3847
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:32,590
I wonder if you have to like look at an
apple and send me wonder how many things

3848
01:52:32,591 --> 01:52:36,700
are involved if like you have to see a
visual apple and think the word apple so

3849
01:52:36,701 --> 01:52:41,620
that your mind knows this
is like if you're visually
sending that information as

3850
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:44,020
well as sending the word to the mind.

3851
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:46,190
Well saw a video

3852
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:49,160
this morning of a guy that
was like 40 years ago.

3853
01:52:49,161 --> 01:52:54,161
He lost both of his arms and he went to
John Hopkins and they were testing this

3854
01:52:54,261 --> 01:52:58,760
new stuff on them and they put it on and
they just said like think about moving

3855
01:52:58,761 --> 01:52:59,480
your hands.

3856
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,810
And so we thought about rotating his
hands out and they did like a full three

3857
01:53:02,811 --> 01:53:03,590
60.

3858
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:04,670
He could move them a little.

3859
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,770
Obviously the technology
is really early on,

3860
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:11,480
but the fact that he can think turn
left and a bunch of Zeros and ones or

3861
01:53:11,481 --> 01:53:14,840
whatever gets thrown into this
machine via his nerves and it happens.

3862
01:53:14,841 --> 01:53:15,441
It's amazing.

3863
01:53:15,441 --> 01:53:18,160
Like where are we going to be in 20 years?

3864
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,370
Most of the video today of the
guy with a two percent of arms,

3865
01:53:22,330 --> 01:53:24,380
we lost them in electrical is electrical,

3866
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:26,350
so they called it like a
freak electrical accident.

3867
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:26,980
We're going to,

3868
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:27,910
in 20 years from now,

3869
01:53:27,911 --> 01:53:32,020
we're going to have completely new limbs
just like Luke skywalker did when darth

3870
01:53:32,021 --> 01:53:33,070
vader cut off his hand.

3871
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:33,700
Remember that shit?

3872
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:33,910
Yeah.

3873
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:34,061
Well,

3874
01:53:34,061 --> 01:53:34,894
I mean that's it.

3875
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:36,191
Those are.

3876
01:53:36,191 --> 01:53:38,380
Those are the things that are most
exciting about three d printing,

3877
01:53:38,381 --> 01:53:39,430
like medical reasons.

3878
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:40,361
That's huge.

3879
01:53:40,361 --> 01:53:41,770
Not me making a key chain.

3880
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:44,500
They've already figured out
how to three D print meniscus,

3881
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:49,450
they've figured out a three d print knee
meniscus with this is a special type.

3882
01:53:49,570 --> 01:53:53,110
It's essentially a scaffolding with a
special type of protein in it and when

3883
01:53:53,111 --> 01:53:54,280
they inserted into the body,

3884
01:53:54,281 --> 01:53:59,281
the body replaces meniscus
on the scaffolding and so
like where they are now.

3885
01:53:59,931 --> 01:54:03,250
Like I've had meniscus scoped
on one of my knees so I tore.

3886
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,650
Some of it is really fucking painful.

3887
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:07,300
They had a bucket handle tear,

3888
01:54:07,301 --> 01:54:08,590
which means it would lock,

3889
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:11,820
it would like lock out and so they go
in there and they scoop it out and they

3890
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:14,770
cut it and they and you heal
up and it works great now,

3891
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:19,540
but it's not as effective because you
lose some of the cushioning between your

3892
01:54:19,541 --> 01:54:20,140
joints.

3893
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:20,321
Well,

3894
01:54:20,321 --> 01:54:23,680
what they're going to be able to do now
is create with three d printing this

3895
01:54:23,681 --> 01:54:26,500
artificial scaffolding for the
meniscus with these proteins in it,

3896
01:54:26,501 --> 01:54:28,930
and you're going to have a
100 percent new meniscus.

3897
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:30,580
It's going to grow back in place,

3898
01:54:30,581 --> 01:54:32,320
which is a life changing thing.

3899
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:33,310
What is this?

3900
01:54:33,310 --> 01:54:33,761
Oh yeah.

3901
01:54:33,761 --> 01:54:36,160
We posted this to dog can walk again.

3902
01:54:36,161 --> 01:54:37,450
Thanks to three d printing.

3903
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:38,470
That was he walking?

3904
01:54:38,471 --> 01:54:39,304
It's got wheels.

3905
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:41,190
It's the cuter version of what this,

3906
01:54:42,430 --> 01:54:43,150
what does he got?

3907
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:43,540
What is that?

3908
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:44,890
They printed out like these,

3909
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:45,500
uh,

3910
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:46,660
kind of like legs almost.

3911
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:47,650
I can't play the video.

3912
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:49,420
He's the dog blade runner.

3913
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:51,213
That's cool.

3914
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:51,880
Yeah,

3915
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,140
I mean they're going to
be able to do anything.

3916
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:55,330
They're going to be able to make human
beings like we were talking about the

3917
01:54:55,331 --> 01:54:56,890
artificial fuck robot,

3918
01:54:56,920 --> 01:55:01,150
people thinking to make that it's
going to happen if people live to be a

3919
01:55:01,150 --> 01:55:01,840
thousand years from now,

3920
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,900
if that's going to be real,

3921
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:05,360
I'm going to be so sad that they're
gonna make sex robots before they do.

3922
01:55:05,450 --> 01:55:06,120
Oregon's like,

3923
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:06,390
you know,

3924
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:07,010
that's gonna happen.

3925
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:07,940
I don't think so.

3926
01:55:07,941 --> 01:55:09,290
I think Oregon will be first.

3927
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:12,170
I think it organs would be first before
they can figure out a way to be a whole

3928
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:12,621
person.

3929
01:55:12,621 --> 01:55:12,771
Yeah.

3930
01:55:12,771 --> 01:55:12,940
Yeah.

3931
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:14,440
I mean that's going to be amazing,

3932
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:17,110
but it's always a weird
thing because I have this,

3933
01:55:17,111 --> 01:55:17,211
uh,

3934
01:55:17,211 --> 01:55:18,041
I have this thing called,

3935
01:55:18,041 --> 01:55:18,310
uh,

3936
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:20,530
pkd polycystic kidney disease.

3937
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:22,030
It's a genetic thing,

3938
01:55:22,031 --> 01:55:24,670
but sometimes I look at it and I'm like,

3939
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:25,600
this is,

3940
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:26,650
this shouldn't be here.

3941
01:55:26,651 --> 01:55:28,360
Like I shouldn't pass this on anymore.

3942
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:32,410
Been we as a society and as
technology advances I get to live.

3943
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:34,240
And what is it involved?

3944
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:37,840
Like what cysts grow over
time it'll really hit me.

3945
01:55:37,841 --> 01:55:39,370
I think around when I'm like 35,

3946
01:55:39,371 --> 01:55:39,850
40,

3947
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:40,683
that's when I hit my dad.

3948
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:42,760
I'm cis form on your kidney.

3949
01:55:42,761 --> 01:55:47,400
And it just essentially slowly squeezes
it to death and so late term you need to

3950
01:55:47,401 --> 01:55:48,120
get a,

3951
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:51,360
like you have to go on dialysis because
their kidneys are failing and then uh,

3952
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:53,400
and then you kinda just have
to get on the donor list.

3953
01:55:53,710 --> 01:55:54,410
Wow.

3954
01:55:54,410 --> 01:55:54,840
Yeah.

3955
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:55,470
It's uh,

3956
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:56,250
it's,

3957
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:57,001
it's rough stuff.

3958
01:55:57,001 --> 01:55:57,780
But I mean,

3959
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:58,970
it hasn't affected me yet,

3960
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:03,420
but it's like that thought
that I sometimes have when
I'm laying down at night

3961
01:56:03,421 --> 01:56:04,770
and just thinking of like infinity,

3962
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:05,933
uh,

3963
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:06,700
that I,

3964
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,760
my specific cells,

3965
01:56:08,761 --> 01:56:10,830
my jeans shouldn't be passed on.

3966
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:11,281
Right.

3967
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:13,200
If you think of us advancing,

3968
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:16,230
but then technology kind
of brings me back along.

3969
01:56:16,231 --> 01:56:16,500
It's like,

3970
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,160
no,

3971
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:19,440
in like a hundred years we'll be
able to make those kidneys again.

3972
01:56:19,441 --> 01:56:19,910
You're fine.

3973
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:20,061
Well,

3974
01:56:20,061 --> 01:56:20,410
people,

3975
01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:21,740
you used to have diabetes,

3976
01:56:21,741 --> 01:56:22,400
we're dead,

3977
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,820
right?

3978
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:23,091
You know,

3979
01:56:23,091 --> 01:56:25,370
there was a death
sentence and now it's not.

3980
01:56:25,371 --> 01:56:26,780
Now you get on insulin,

3981
01:56:26,781 --> 01:56:29,660
they figured out a way to change your
diet and that's a huge issue as well.

3982
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,310
Does that have anything
to do with your diet?

3983
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:33,850
With the kidneys is the
right way to long it?

3984
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:33,960
Yeah.

3985
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:34,750
Oregon kind of like,

3986
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:37,020
I have to make sure that
I always drink a lot,

3987
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:40,200
a ton of water and drinking
should be problematic.

3988
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:40,421
Right.

3989
01:56:40,421 --> 01:56:41,610
Is drinking alcohol.

3990
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:42,780
I think that's more.

3991
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,700
I think that's more of a liver.

3992
01:56:44,701 --> 01:56:45,031
Yeah.

3993
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:45,630
I um,

3994
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:46,710
for the most part it's just.

3995
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:47,130
I mean,

3996
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:48,990
I'm starting to think
more about my health.

3997
01:56:48,991 --> 01:56:49,261
I mean,

3998
01:56:49,261 --> 01:56:51,360
you guys were talking about like
going up and down in weight.

3999
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:51,930
Uh,

4000
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:55,560
I dropped 35 pounds this
year mainly because I just,

4001
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:56,580
I don't wanna die.

4002
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:58,920
I wanna I want to be able to.

4003
01:56:58,950 --> 01:56:59,810
Because also when,

4004
01:56:59,870 --> 01:57:01,080
when pkd hits me harder,

4005
01:57:01,081 --> 01:57:02,940
it's gonna be harder to exercise.

4006
01:57:02,941 --> 01:57:07,200
I have to like train myself essentially
to just not eat like an asshole like I

4007
01:57:07,201 --> 01:57:07,690
normally do.

4008
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:08,523
Right.

4009
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:09,380
Wow.

4010
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:10,071
That's intense.

4011
01:57:10,071 --> 01:57:10,370
Man.

4012
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:14,980
Kidneys are a big one in mixed martial
arts because guys cut weight a lot and so

4013
01:57:14,990 --> 01:57:16,880
a lot of them wind up
getting kidney stones.

4014
01:57:17,450 --> 01:57:18,283
That's the worst thing.

4015
01:57:19,370 --> 01:57:21,320
Apparently it's a genetic thing.

4016
01:57:21,321 --> 01:57:22,700
Some people just don't ever get it,

4017
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:24,830
but some people when they cut weight,

4018
01:57:24,831 --> 01:57:28,730
kidney stones become a huge issue and
it has something to do with dehydration.

4019
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:31,640
Dee Dee dee dehydration slash genetics.

4020
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:32,061
Yeah,

4021
01:57:32,061 --> 01:57:32,451
I've had,

4022
01:57:32,451 --> 01:57:36,620
I've had one because I think there's like
a 40 percent higher chance that if you

4023
01:57:36,621 --> 01:57:37,091
have it you will,

4024
01:57:37,091 --> 01:57:39,140
you'll get more kidney stones have.

4025
01:57:39,141 --> 01:57:41,810
You Don't have to pee it out.

4026
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,673
Is that what happened?

4027
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:43,010
Yeah.

4028
01:57:43,010 --> 01:57:45,480
So mine mine was a,

4029
01:57:45,481 --> 01:57:47,810
it wasn't so big that they
had to like try and blast it.

4030
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:48,350
Uh,

4031
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:48,891
but they essentially,

4032
01:57:48,891 --> 01:57:52,340
I think that they gave me percocet and
I was essentially in and out for three

4033
01:57:52,341 --> 01:57:55,160
days at home and at some
point I paid it out.

4034
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:56,511
I was just like,

4035
01:57:56,511 --> 01:57:57,910
I'm going to drug this one out.

4036
01:57:58,390 --> 01:58:00,710
I'm not doing this because I was like,

4037
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:01,101
okay,

4038
01:58:01,101 --> 01:58:03,280
now maybe it's just I have
back pain like first day,

4039
01:58:03,281 --> 01:58:03,920
the second day.

4040
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:04,080
Oh,

4041
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,480
went away third day.

4042
01:58:05,510 --> 01:58:05,661
Oh,

4043
01:58:05,661 --> 01:58:06,494
it just moved,

4044
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:07,520
like that's what it was.

4045
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:10,760
The pain is just a
different place and yeah,

4046
01:58:10,761 --> 01:58:13,610
that was the least fun thing
I've experienced in my life,

4047
01:58:13,611 --> 01:58:13,930
man.

4048
01:58:13,930 --> 01:58:16,620
Being out of little rock and
then imagine giving birth.

4049
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:18,360
Imagine what women goes.

4050
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:19,540
You did your actual

4051
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:25,410
dose dose out twice crazy.

4052
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:26,490
I thought I'd never want to.

4053
01:58:26,491 --> 01:58:27,390
And then I was just like,

4054
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:27,541
no,

4055
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:27,990
I have to.

4056
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:29,010
Got To have to be there.

4057
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:29,710
Yeah.

4058
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:30,310
It's um,

4059
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:31,300
it's beautiful in a way.

4060
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,530
It's strange.

4061
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:33,250
It's,

4062
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:33,500
you know,

4063
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:38,500
it's very oddly psychedelic because when
that child was coming out of my wife's

4064
01:58:40,241 --> 01:58:41,050
body,

4065
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:42,460
I was thinking to myself like,

4066
01:58:42,461 --> 01:58:42,910
wow,

4067
01:58:42,910 --> 01:58:45,580
this is what's happening right now.

4068
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:48,340
All over the world and mass.

4069
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:51,810
There are millions of babies
coming out of a giant,

4070
01:58:51,970 --> 01:58:53,270
like simultaneously.

4071
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:59,500
And I imagined seeing it
on some massive screen,

4072
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,960
like seeing a million windows,

4073
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:05,080
like if you had a massive computer
screen with a million windows open,

4074
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:07,180
just babies being born and people dying,

4075
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:10,210
just seeing if he's getting a destroyed.

4076
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:11,830
I didn't think of it that way.

4077
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:13,410
I thought of it the positive way.

4078
01:59:13,411 --> 01:59:14,520
So on the,

4079
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,070
the,

4080
01:59:15,070 --> 01:59:16,590
the idea of this,

4081
01:59:16,890 --> 01:59:21,040
this giant super organism that's
constantly expanding and contracting,

4082
01:59:21,050 --> 01:59:22,150
expanding and contracting.

4083
01:59:22,151 --> 01:59:22,960
And you know,

4084
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:26,620
most of the time now expanding
more than contracting.

4085
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:28,690
When you find out that the population,

4086
01:59:28,691 --> 01:59:30,190
number of the world,

4087
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:31,083
just like,

4088
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:35,590
I believe like in the 19 fifties
it was only 2 billion in the world,

4089
01:59:35,591 --> 01:59:36,424
something like that.

4090
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:37,360
And now it's seven.

4091
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:38,020
Right?

4092
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:38,920
That's fucking nuts.

4093
01:59:38,921 --> 01:59:39,341
That's crazy.

4094
01:59:39,341 --> 01:59:39,610
Yeah.

4095
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:40,271
That's weird.

4096
01:59:40,271 --> 01:59:44,910
Like less than 100 years
and it's $5 billion plus.

4097
01:59:46,730 --> 01:59:47,590
Well that's what I'm saying.

4098
01:59:47,591 --> 01:59:47,801
Right?

4099
01:59:47,801 --> 01:59:52,801
So as stuff advances and people like
me and people that were supposed to,

4100
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:55,120
well not supposed to
genetically would have died.

4101
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:55,840
Right.

4102
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:00,840
Technology is going to have to advanced
for food and space faster because

4103
02:00:01,781 --> 02:00:02,920
otherwise we're just going to die,

4104
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:03,920
but it's not going to have it.

4105
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:05,260
What the court.

4106
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:06,820
You say just eat corn.

4107
02:00:06,821 --> 02:00:07,061
Yeah.

4108
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:11,590
What does that maybe to cast stella that
eat corn if it's just corn left at the

4109
02:00:11,591 --> 02:00:12,424
end,

4110
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:13,540
but I'm not supposed to.

4111
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:16,690
Nineteen 50.

4112
02:00:16,691 --> 02:00:18,370
There was only 2 billion
people in the world.

4113
02:00:18,371 --> 02:00:19,204
That was what it was.

4114
02:00:19,570 --> 02:00:20,620
That's crazy.

4115
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:21,553
Blowing up.

4116
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:21,881
Yeah,

4117
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:22,631
it was 2 billion.

4118
02:00:22,631 --> 02:00:25,510
Five hundred and $66,000 or 550.

4119
02:00:25,511 --> 02:00:26,310
$6,000.

4120
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:27,143
That's not.

4121
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:28,033
And is it that.

4122
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,050
I'm trying to think how much
of that has the Internet.

4123
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:31,543
Mostly porn.

4124
02:00:32,030 --> 02:00:33,530
Well now it's 7 billion.

4125
02:00:33,531 --> 02:00:33,771
I mean,

4126
02:00:33,771 --> 02:00:34,604
but this is,

4127
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:37,430
this was the world in 1950.

4128
02:00:37,431 --> 02:00:38,780
It was so much smaller.

4129
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:39,850
There was so many.

4130
02:00:40,190 --> 02:00:40,491
I mean,

4131
02:00:40,491 --> 02:00:42,650
how many people were in America in 1950?

4132
02:00:42,651 --> 02:00:43,484
What do we say?

4133
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:44,690
US population.

4134
02:00:44,691 --> 02:00:45,140
Nineteen 50.

4135
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:45,973
What did

4136
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:48,380
you say?

4137
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:49,010
Three.

4138
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:50,180
Three something?

4139
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:51,243
Yeah.

4140
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:51,680
I don't know.

4141
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,280
I'd say what?

4142
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:55,190
Maybe let's go with $3,150 million.

4143
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:56,293
A hundred 50.

4144
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:57,493
Half.

4145
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:58,730
That's incredible.

4146
02:00:58,990 --> 02:00:59,120
Yeah.

4147
02:00:59,120 --> 02:00:59,680
I'm trying to think.

4148
02:00:59,680 --> 02:00:59,951
Yeah.

4149
02:00:59,951 --> 02:01:01,450
I wonder what the United States.

4150
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:04,570
You have the baby boom
compared to other places,

4151
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:05,713
you know,

4152
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:06,701
1940.

4153
02:01:06,701 --> 02:01:07,840
It was only 131.

4154
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:09,910
As soon as they start
figuring out medicine,

4155
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:11,140
that's where it all went downhill.

4156
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:15,010
No child left behind.

4157
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:17,950
I mean that's also how you invent shit,

4158
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:18,460
Ya know,

4159
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:20,920
you have to have surplus and
you have to have leisure.

4160
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:24,160
You have to have people that have the
ability to sit in front of computers and

4161
02:01:24,161 --> 02:01:25,480
desks and figure things out.

4162
02:01:25,481 --> 02:01:26,314
And that's where you,

4163
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:27,910
without agriculture,

4164
02:01:27,911 --> 02:01:31,240
without cities and without civilization,

4165
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:31,751
you know,

4166
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:33,060
you don't have any inventions.

4167
02:01:33,170 --> 02:01:35,920
So all of it comes out
of our ability to relax.

4168
02:01:35,950 --> 02:01:36,130
You know,

4169
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:37,000
we have the food,

4170
02:01:37,001 --> 02:01:38,950
we have a place where we can sleep.

4171
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:39,860
Okay,

4172
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:43,790
let's relax and let's work on other stuff
instead of hunting and gathering all

4173
02:01:43,791 --> 02:01:44,181
the time.

4174
02:01:44,181 --> 02:01:46,400
Let's try to figure out
how to make a wheel.

4175
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:47,150
Oh,

4176
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:51,830
I think we can figure out a way to have
a controlled explosion that powers and

4177
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:55,880
engine and that engine can get us on a
road and we can get places that we can't

4178
02:01:55,881 --> 02:01:56,714
get to by walking.

4179
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:57,110
Right.

4180
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:57,290
Well,

4181
02:01:57,290 --> 02:01:58,700
so I would be interested.

4182
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,260
So technology in general,

4183
02:02:00,261 --> 02:02:00,561
it's good.

4184
02:02:00,561 --> 02:02:00,980
We're all,

4185
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:02,870
we're all going up at some point.

4186
02:02:02,871 --> 02:02:05,000
I mean I think it's very close with um,

4187
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:06,870
with self driving cars and,

4188
02:02:06,871 --> 02:02:08,600
and just even computers in general,

4189
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:11,910
like they're gonna be a lot of
people that they don't have.

4190
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:12,890
They're not gonna have a job anymore.

4191
02:02:12,891 --> 02:02:13,760
They're like their,

4192
02:02:13,761 --> 02:02:14,510
their place,

4193
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:14,751
right.

4194
02:02:14,751 --> 02:02:16,100
If I think of my skill set,

4195
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:19,160
I can be replaced for the
most part by a computer.

4196
02:02:19,161 --> 02:02:21,890
Like you have all the people
in the fast food industry.

4197
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:22,460
I think like,

4198
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:22,670
you know,

4199
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:26,930
they've been going out saying
they want $15 an hour in New York.

4200
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:28,670
At the end of the day,

4201
02:02:28,671 --> 02:02:30,020
if you own that business,

4202
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:32,420
technology isn't a place
where all those front,

4203
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:33,770
the people in the front,

4204
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:35,320
you don't need you.

4205
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:36,920
You just have like a kiosk.

4206
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:37,570
No,

4207
02:02:37,570 --> 02:02:38,620
but isn't that the case?

4208
02:02:38,621 --> 02:02:43,270
Like always like if do we
need blacksmiths to have jobs?

4209
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:44,080
Right?

4210
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:44,621
Should we play?

4211
02:02:44,621 --> 02:02:44,891
Well,

4212
02:02:44,891 --> 02:02:46,090
we without the horses,

4213
02:02:46,091 --> 02:02:47,020
what do I do?

4214
02:02:47,410 --> 02:02:49,240
Maybe you need to come up
with a new thing to do,

4215
02:02:49,241 --> 02:02:51,940
but if we're going to run out of shit to
do and then just go to twitter and like

4216
02:02:51,941 --> 02:02:53,950
give you shit with entire day.

4217
02:02:54,490 --> 02:02:55,001
Sure.

4218
02:02:55,001 --> 02:02:58,750
All those people that are running out
of shit to do a probably if they found a

4219
02:02:58,751 --> 02:03:01,600
thing they enjoyed would have
some other thing that they can do.

4220
02:03:01,650 --> 02:03:02,050
Right.

4221
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:07,050
I just think it's kind of crazy to
think of progress as taking away jobs.

4222
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,461
Yeah.

4223
02:03:08,461 --> 02:03:08,720
And,

4224
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:09,870
but that's the argument.

4225
02:03:09,871 --> 02:03:10,810
So many times the.

4226
02:03:10,811 --> 02:03:12,210
If you look at like the trucking industry,

4227
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:13,210
if you look at,

4228
02:03:13,210 --> 02:03:16,110
I mean right now the big one is Uber,

4229
02:03:16,270 --> 02:03:17,103
right?

4230
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:18,810
I mean that's not even automated cars.

4231
02:03:18,811 --> 02:03:21,450
That's just convenience
and everyone's like,

4232
02:03:21,451 --> 02:03:22,260
no,

4233
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:22,771
we can't.

4234
02:03:22,771 --> 02:03:23,110
This is,

4235
02:03:23,110 --> 02:03:25,050
we have something that's
already established,

4236
02:03:25,051 --> 02:03:29,160
a track sheet community is
upset and so and those guys,

4237
02:03:29,161 --> 02:03:33,660
I bet those guys are the guys that
are sharing any terrible uber story.

4238
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:34,710
Uber's everywhere.

4239
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:38,610
Uber's worth $41,000,000,000
and none incredible right quick.

4240
02:03:38,611 --> 02:03:39,090
That happened.

4241
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:40,140
There were two instances,

4242
02:03:40,170 --> 02:03:45,060
instances of something happening and
everyone's like Uber's shit on in India,

4243
02:03:45,061 --> 02:03:45,894
right?

4244
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:46,770
Yeah.

4245
02:03:46,770 --> 02:03:47,221
There was a,

4246
02:03:47,221 --> 02:03:47,700
there was,

4247
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:49,290
there was a rape accusation there,

4248
02:03:49,291 --> 02:03:50,130
there was also.

4249
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:53,750
And so I think it's good to those stories
come out because it background checks

4250
02:03:53,751 --> 02:03:54,584
super important.

4251
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:56,880
Obviously a huge.

4252
02:03:57,090 --> 02:04:00,540
Someone's driving you around in
a metal box and then there was a,

4253
02:04:00,541 --> 02:04:04,020
I think there was also another one
where a guy that had been convicted or

4254
02:04:04,021 --> 02:04:05,700
charged with a violent
crime killed someone.

4255
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:09,520
Wasn't there one where a guy like took
someone somewhere and wouldn't let him

4256
02:04:09,521 --> 02:04:10,090
go,

4257
02:04:10,090 --> 02:04:14,020
like protect them to some
abandoned warehouse or some
shit or something that was

4258
02:04:14,021 --> 02:04:14,854
an American thing.

4259
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:15,610
I don't know.

4260
02:04:15,610 --> 02:04:17,140
Took them to a parking lot or something.

4261
02:04:18,110 --> 02:04:21,680
Maybe you might be thinking
of fake taxi as a fake tax.

4262
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:22,761
Don't Google it.

4263
02:04:22,761 --> 02:04:23,470
It's okay.

4264
02:04:23,470 --> 02:04:24,303
No,

4265
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:25,210
no.

4266
02:04:25,210 --> 02:04:25,790
Um,

4267
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:26,990
but I also at the same time,

4268
02:04:26,991 --> 02:04:28,130
anytime I hear those stories,

4269
02:04:28,131 --> 02:04:32,510
I think of every drunk friend
I have that's yelled at
or done something wrong to

4270
02:04:32,511 --> 02:04:33,344
an uber driver.

4271
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:34,233
And I'm like,

4272
02:04:34,370 --> 02:04:35,410
maybe it,

4273
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:36,141
yeah,

4274
02:04:36,141 --> 02:04:37,040
there's a bunch of shit.

4275
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,760
It's not the India situation,

4276
02:04:38,761 --> 02:04:40,170
but obviously like the,

4277
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:41,070
the,

4278
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:41,691
there was a,

4279
02:04:41,691 --> 02:04:41,850
uh,

4280
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:45,030
words that turned into fists
really with Uber Drivers.

4281
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:45,331
Well,

4282
02:04:45,331 --> 02:04:45,481
yeah,

4283
02:04:45,481 --> 02:04:46,081
with the story.

4284
02:04:46,081 --> 02:04:46,740
I'm just like,

4285
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:47,160
uh,

4286
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:48,510
there've been those small instances,

4287
02:04:48,570 --> 02:04:50,070
but it's not widespread.

4288
02:04:50,071 --> 02:04:51,120
I think for me,

4289
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:53,730
I don't care if the guy that
owns uber's a huge asshole,

4290
02:04:53,731 --> 02:04:54,720
all I know is it's convenient.

4291
02:04:54,850 --> 02:04:55,100
Right.

4292
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:58,740
And it's forcing the taxi companies to
change where they come out with like

4293
02:04:58,741 --> 02:04:59,551
their versions,

4294
02:04:59,551 --> 02:05:00,870
which I still don't use,

4295
02:05:00,871 --> 02:05:01,740
but I think,

4296
02:05:01,770 --> 02:05:02,730
I think it just makes sense.

4297
02:05:02,731 --> 02:05:04,380
Like let's keep doing
more and more and more.

4298
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:05,111
Yeah.

4299
02:05:05,111 --> 02:05:05,440
I,

4300
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,150
well they're very friendly,

4301
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:07,541
like,

4302
02:05:07,541 --> 02:05:09,130
especially Uber in New York City,

4303
02:05:09,131 --> 02:05:11,340
I found them to be much
more friendly than calves.

4304
02:05:11,341 --> 02:05:12,190
Calves are just like,

4305
02:05:12,191 --> 02:05:12,551
you know,

4306
02:05:12,551 --> 02:05:13,540
that you know,

4307
02:05:13,810 --> 02:05:14,740
that you need them.

4308
02:05:14,741 --> 02:05:17,860
They know you need them and sometimes
they're shitheads a lot of times they're

4309
02:05:17,861 --> 02:05:18,221
friendly,

4310
02:05:18,221 --> 02:05:20,890
but the uber drivers were
like across the board,

4311
02:05:20,891 --> 02:05:25,570
friendly almost because it's this new
thing and they also want you to give them

4312
02:05:25,571 --> 02:05:26,201
stars,

4313
02:05:26,201 --> 02:05:26,411
you know,

4314
02:05:26,411 --> 02:05:26,740
they'll,

4315
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:28,530
they'll want you to rate them and they,

4316
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:29,980
if they were rated highly than people,

4317
02:05:29,981 --> 02:05:34,180
get excited about that person picking
them up and then I'll also tip them as

4318
02:05:34,181 --> 02:05:35,630
well as you know,

4319
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:36,020
the,

4320
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:38,410
the money that they get from the little,

4321
02:05:39,070 --> 02:05:39,330
the,

4322
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:39,600
the,

4323
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:41,500
the application where your
credit cards in there.

4324
02:05:41,770 --> 02:05:42,610
They get a percentage of that.

4325
02:05:42,611 --> 02:05:42,970
Right.

4326
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:43,803
It's like something.

4327
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:45,011
I forgot what the,

4328
02:05:45,011 --> 02:05:46,210
I forgot what the split is.

4329
02:05:46,211 --> 02:05:47,044
I know that

4330
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:52,420
I knew a guy that was part of that watch
my show that was an uber x driver and I

4331
02:05:52,421 --> 02:05:55,060
think they get a similar rate
or something slightly different,

4332
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:56,471
but those,

4333
02:05:56,471 --> 02:05:57,970
I think those weird me out a little more.

4334
02:05:58,300 --> 02:05:59,170
Uber X is weird.

4335
02:05:59,190 --> 02:05:59,290
Yeah,

4336
02:05:59,290 --> 02:06:01,390
that's a car that's
like someone's just car.

4337
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:03,880
Someone rolls up in a cube
and then get in and I'm like,

4338
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:06,890
I had a guy picked somebody
up here in a Prius,

4339
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:10,580
in a certain room or a volt
was like a volt was a fake.

4340
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:12,510
This is way better though,

4341
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:13,200
is it?

4342
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:16,740
Unfortunately my girlfriend uses lyft
and I don't think that they have the same

4343
02:06:16,830 --> 02:06:18,180
quality control.

4344
02:06:18,181 --> 02:06:20,500
And as Uber this guy came in with windows.

4345
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:20,820
What?

4346
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:23,910
F 10 pickup trucks with
the big pickup back in a,

4347
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:24,753
in a cab.

4348
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:25,321
You know,

4349
02:06:25,321 --> 02:06:27,810
like what construction workers she gets.

4350
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:28,741
We both get in.

4351
02:06:28,741 --> 02:06:28,981
I'm like,

4352
02:06:28,981 --> 02:06:30,930
why did you call an uber or
why didn't you call Uber?

4353
02:06:30,931 --> 02:06:31,764
I get in,

4354
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:35,310
there's a shovel in the back of his truck.

4355
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:41,220
The guy seemed like flustered that I
was there because I think he just saw my

4356
02:06:41,221 --> 02:06:43,710
girlfriend's profile pic was corrupt.

4357
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:44,580
So then he,

4358
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:46,110
he fakes a phone call.

4359
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:47,820
Jamie was watching me the whole time.

4360
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,960
He fakes a phone call and starts
yelling at somebody and we're just like,

4361
02:06:51,961 --> 02:06:54,360
what are we doing in this is not driving.

4362
02:06:54,361 --> 02:06:54,901
He's just sitting there.

4363
02:06:54,901 --> 02:06:55,540
I'm like,

4364
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:55,850
like,

4365
02:06:55,850 --> 02:06:56,270
uh.

4366
02:06:56,270 --> 02:06:57,060
So we get out.

4367
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:59,100
He's Jamie's outside taking photos.

4368
02:06:59,101 --> 02:07:01,410
Because he thinks that it
looks something's not right,

4369
02:07:01,770 --> 02:07:04,020
and I'm like thinking
my girlfriend wasn't.

4370
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:05,490
If I wasn't with my girlfriend,

4371
02:07:05,491 --> 02:07:09,240
she would have got in this weird car
with a shovel in the back and he,

4372
02:07:09,241 --> 02:07:10,200
you know what the fuck?

4373
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:11,213
He's a gardener

4374
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:13,680
really into plants.

4375
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:14,510
Yeah.

4376
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:15,180
Yeah.

4377
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:15,361
Well,

4378
02:07:15,361 --> 02:07:16,490
so I mean with the,

4379
02:07:16,530 --> 02:07:17,281
with women I,

4380
02:07:17,281 --> 02:07:18,870
I'm one of the last week were drivers.

4381
02:07:18,871 --> 02:07:20,760
I had my friends,

4382
02:07:20,761 --> 02:07:21,091
once again,

4383
02:07:21,091 --> 02:07:21,421
we're super,

4384
02:07:21,421 --> 02:07:22,920
super drunk and they're
asking all these questions.

4385
02:07:22,921 --> 02:07:23,970
I don't know if he was messing around,

4386
02:07:23,971 --> 02:07:24,440
but he was like,

4387
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:24,780
no,

4388
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:29,160
a good number of uber drivers if they're
like attractive men are constantly

4389
02:07:29,161 --> 02:07:29,994
invited inside.

4390
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:31,170
Like at the end.

4391
02:07:31,190 --> 02:07:31,530
Yeah.

4392
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:32,430
And I was like,

4393
02:07:32,431 --> 02:07:33,390
that seems like a perk.

4394
02:07:33,580 --> 02:07:34,413
Yeah,

4395
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:36,190
a good number of them.

4396
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:37,293
Yeah.

4397
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:39,010
Drunk chicks coming home from bars,

4398
02:07:39,011 --> 02:07:39,221
man,

4399
02:07:39,221 --> 02:07:41,830
there's a guy you might
come in to smoke some weed,

4400
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:42,061
you know,

4401
02:07:42,061 --> 02:07:42,730
Shit.

4402
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:43,410
Probably.

4403
02:07:43,410 --> 02:07:44,050
Pow,

4404
02:07:44,050 --> 02:07:44,350
POW,

4405
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:45,130
POW.

4406
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:48,400
Aaa I think is doing it
now because you really.

4407
02:07:48,830 --> 02:07:49,140
Well,

4408
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:50,380
a lot of people do it to make money.

4409
02:07:50,381 --> 02:07:51,060
I mean,

4410
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:52,270
you could do it on your own time,

4411
02:07:52,271 --> 02:07:52,480
you know,

4412
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,310
you could have your own shifts in a way.

4413
02:07:54,311 --> 02:07:55,510
It's kind of cool if,

4414
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:58,110
if they have real background checks,

4415
02:07:58,160 --> 02:08:01,510
I mean if they really make sure
you have no mental health issues,

4416
02:08:01,511 --> 02:08:01,760
you know,

4417
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:03,170
fucking sex Predator,

4418
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:07,030
fill in the blank know and it's such a
genius idea just because it's like you

4419
02:08:07,031 --> 02:08:08,710
don't really have to have
that much infrastructure.

4420
02:08:08,770 --> 02:08:09,150
Yeah.

4421
02:08:09,150 --> 02:08:09,370
You know,

4422
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:10,300
just to get things rolling.

4423
02:08:10,301 --> 02:08:12,380
Especially with the
introduction a long time ago.

4424
02:08:12,450 --> 02:08:13,283
Uber X,

4425
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:14,913
Uber X.

4426
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:15,660
Yeah.

4427
02:08:15,660 --> 02:08:16,451
That's where it gets weird,

4428
02:08:16,451 --> 02:08:17,284
right?

4429
02:08:17,790 --> 02:08:21,490
They have spotify now where like on your
phone you could sit there and control

4430
02:08:21,491 --> 02:08:25,060
the music that's in the car so you
can put on whatever music you want.

4431
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:25,953
Crazy.

4432
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:29,230
Pretty soon it's gonna be rolling up the
windows and turning on air conditioning

4433
02:08:29,231 --> 02:08:29,680
and.

4434
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:29,801
Well,

4435
02:08:29,801 --> 02:08:30,730
how do you feel about these,

4436
02:08:30,731 --> 02:08:31,090
uh,

4437
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:32,140
Google cars?

4438
02:08:32,141 --> 02:08:33,670
These self driving cars.

4439
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:34,330
It's awesome.

4440
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:35,081
That's fascinating.

4441
02:08:35,081 --> 02:08:35,270
Yeah,

4442
02:08:35,270 --> 02:08:37,330
I mean I think there was
something recently where they,

4443
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:38,920
they're not the best
in the rain right now,

4444
02:08:38,921 --> 02:08:40,000
but it's still early tech.

4445
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:40,930
Oh look,

4446
02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:42,220
they don't the breaking,

4447
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:46,180
they don't think it's something with the
way that it perceives like the outside

4448
02:08:46,181 --> 02:08:46,850
world,

4449
02:08:46,850 --> 02:08:51,670
a slippery traction things on those
lines because they always ended up having

4450
02:08:51,671 --> 02:08:51,911
these,

4451
02:08:51,911 --> 02:08:54,580
these articles and stories where they
talk about things like I don't think about

4452
02:08:54,581 --> 02:08:55,414
like uh,

4453
02:08:55,420 --> 02:08:56,320
people on bicycles,

4454
02:08:56,350 --> 02:08:56,621
you know,

4455
02:08:56,621 --> 02:08:59,860
things that don't look
like cars and I don't know,

4456
02:08:59,861 --> 02:09:01,150
I mean it's baby steps.

4457
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:02,620
It's not going to be there tomorrow,

4458
02:09:02,621 --> 02:09:03,880
but I think it's awesome.

4459
02:09:03,881 --> 02:09:04,370
I think you,

4460
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:04,580
you,

4461
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:04,910
you,

4462
02:09:04,910 --> 02:09:08,260
you're talking about once again more
people surviving because you were a car

4463
02:09:08,261 --> 02:09:08,710
accident.

4464
02:09:08,710 --> 02:09:13,570
If you can have some sort of system
that can be thrown into an old car,

4465
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:14,141
you know,

4466
02:09:14,141 --> 02:09:14,560
people.

4467
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:16,830
I'm not saying make it
mandatory because I like,

4468
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:18,160
I love driving my car.

4469
02:09:18,190 --> 02:09:19,330
Like it gets me excited.

4470
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:21,820
A bacardi drove a challenger.

4471
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:22,833
Oh yeah.

4472
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:24,070
You've seen the hellcat.

4473
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:25,083
Yes.

4474
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:26,170
Really?

4475
02:09:26,170 --> 02:09:27,003
Yes.

4476
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:27,843
It looks exciting.

4477
02:09:27,890 --> 02:09:29,230
It looks like 700 horsepower.

4478
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:29,650
Wow.

4479
02:09:29,650 --> 02:09:30,483
That's not necessarily.

4480
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:31,833
How much is it though?

4481
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:33,130
It's not that expensive.

4482
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:34,630
It's like $65,000.

4483
02:09:34,670 --> 02:09:39,070
That's 700 horsepower car with a warranty.

4484
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:42,670
It's amazing and it's
really comfortable to drive.

4485
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:44,740
We drove around for a few days in Denver.

4486
02:09:44,741 --> 02:09:45,521
It's really nice.

4487
02:09:45,521 --> 02:09:45,940
Yeah,

4488
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:46,630
I uh,

4489
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:46,870
yeah.

4490
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:48,220
Before that I had a,

4491
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:49,390
it was like an rx eight.

4492
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:52,480
It was like a Mazda rx eight and it's
just like this little little tiny car.

4493
02:09:52,481 --> 02:09:57,100
And then I got into that and it's
one Mercedes has this new s class,

4494
02:09:57,101 --> 02:09:58,010
the [inaudible],

4495
02:09:58,070 --> 02:10:02,350
another big luxury sedan that
drives itself up to 30 miles.

4496
02:10:02,351 --> 02:10:04,690
An hour like stays in lanes,

4497
02:10:04,691 --> 02:10:05,740
makes turns,

4498
02:10:05,770 --> 02:10:06,640
it reads,

4499
02:10:06,730 --> 02:10:07,810
it reads speed,

4500
02:10:07,811 --> 02:10:10,540
limit signs and will
follow the speed limits.

4501
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:11,230
Dude,

4502
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:12,670
it's fucking crazy.

4503
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,270
That's awesome.

4504
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:13,810
And it's,

4505
02:10:13,810 --> 02:10:17,650
it's good to about 30 miles
an hour where you set this?

4506
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:19,031
The sensors?

4507
02:10:19,031 --> 02:10:19,161
I don't,

4508
02:10:19,161 --> 02:10:23,290
I don't know all the tech but it
breaks when cars are in front of you,

4509
02:10:23,291 --> 02:10:25,300
slows down when traffic slows down,

4510
02:10:25,301 --> 02:10:26,134
speeds up.

4511
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:29,010
So like around town you were
essentially could be like just,

4512
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:29,860
you know,

4513
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:33,320
hands in your pants and this
thing's driving 30 miles an hour.

4514
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:34,130
This fucking

4515
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:34,600
crazy.

4516
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:35,271
Where are you rolling?

4517
02:10:35,271 --> 02:10:38,780
Thirty miles an hour with your
hands down your pants everywhere.

4518
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:39,920
If I could.

4519
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:40,101
Well,

4520
02:10:40,101 --> 02:10:41,600
especially because it has a screen,

4521
02:10:41,630 --> 02:10:43,480
it has these giant LCD screens,

4522
02:10:43,490 --> 02:10:45,470
these 2:12 inch lcd screens.

4523
02:10:45,471 --> 02:10:48,110
The speedometer is a 12 inch LCD screen.

4524
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:49,160
All your gauges,

4525
02:10:49,161 --> 02:10:51,890
your gauge cluster is all
an lcd screen and you're.

4526
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:53,180
You're fucking nap screen.

4527
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:56,060
Ian Edwards and I rented
one when we were in DC.

4528
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:57,100
Dude,

4529
02:10:57,100 --> 02:11:02,100
they are so slick and the all
your navigation system is huge.

4530
02:11:02,541 --> 02:11:06,710
It's 12 inches enormous and
you could watch movies on it.

4531
02:11:07,730 --> 02:11:08,930
The way it's set up,

4532
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:12,530
only the pasture can see the
movie like when the car is moving,

4533
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:14,180
but when you're parked you can see it.

4534
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:18,590
Say That's the thing that annoys me the
most is when like my gps that's built in

4535
02:11:18,591 --> 02:11:21,890
treats me like a child and I can't
answer that and anything in rides.

4536
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:22,311
Yeah,

4537
02:11:22,311 --> 02:11:25,460
but BMW allows you to do it
on the fly as you're driving.

4538
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:28,400
I liked that you spin the
wheel and you enter into it.

4539
02:11:29,330 --> 02:11:32,300
Mercedes is like a little more goofy.

4540
02:11:32,390 --> 02:11:33,081
The interface,

4541
02:11:33,081 --> 02:11:34,160
like the wheel,

4542
02:11:34,190 --> 02:11:36,350
the BMW we'll is very easy to use.

4543
02:11:36,410 --> 02:11:36,561
Yeah,

4544
02:11:36,561 --> 02:11:37,040
that's it.

4545
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:37,820
That's the.

4546
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:38,050
Yeah,

4547
02:11:38,050 --> 02:11:38,930
that's a sexy car.

4548
02:11:38,990 --> 02:11:40,390
It's a dope car and it's.

4549
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:42,920
You're floating when
you drive in that thing,

4550
02:11:42,921 --> 02:11:43,191
man,

4551
02:11:43,191 --> 02:11:44,390
I mean it just floats over.

4552
02:11:44,391 --> 02:11:45,350
Potholes and everything.

4553
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:47,180
It's super comfortable inside,

4554
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:50,270
but that technology is,

4555
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:52,190
I mean this is like baby steps.

4556
02:11:52,191 --> 02:11:56,180
It's allowing you to essentially keep
your hands off the wheel up to about 30

4557
02:11:56,181 --> 02:11:56,811
miles an hour.

4558
02:11:56,811 --> 02:11:58,580
They don't recommend you take
your hands off the wheel,

4559
02:11:58,581 --> 02:12:03,350
but essentially it really does drive
itself and there's some videos of guys

4560
02:12:03,351 --> 02:12:06,350
trying and working on it
and it really does work.

4561
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:07,550
That's so interesting.

4562
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:12,140
But you have to have a clearly defined
lines on the road because it goes by

4563
02:12:12,141 --> 02:12:16,860
cameras and the cameras interpret what
it's seeing and it figures out how to

4564
02:12:16,861 --> 02:12:17,810
steer and drive.

4565
02:12:17,810 --> 02:12:18,200
It's like,

4566
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:18,351
well,

4567
02:12:18,351 --> 02:12:18,680
if there's,

4568
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,491
if that's already a thing,

4569
02:12:19,491 --> 02:12:19,701
right?

4570
02:12:19,701 --> 02:12:21,820
It's processors get faster
and cameras can do it.

4571
02:12:21,821 --> 02:12:23,000
Go higher frames per second.

4572
02:12:23,001 --> 02:12:25,250
Like I wonder when that can go like 70.

4573
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:26,323
It's going to happen.

4574
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:27,300
It's a matter of time.

4575
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:27,610
Well,

4576
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:29,030
how fast can the Google cargo?

4577
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:29,460
Uh,

4578
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:30,230
I think it's 30,

4579
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:31,340
so I think it's around the same range.

4580
02:12:31,370 --> 02:12:32,120
Oh really?

4581
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:33,170
I didn't know it was that week.

4582
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:33,590
Well,

4583
02:12:33,590 --> 02:12:35,570
not that we're getting on the highway
with those because if you sound like the

4584
02:12:35,571 --> 02:12:37,100
newest one that doesn't
have a steering wheel,

4585
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:40,720
like it's just you
saying that that's crazy.

4586
02:12:40,770 --> 02:12:41,660
Like good luck.

4587
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:41,871
Yeah.

4588
02:12:41,871 --> 02:12:44,060
Because it seems like you
should have a steering wheel.

4589
02:12:44,090 --> 02:12:45,650
Like it seems like it should be.

4590
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:50,860
At least now it should be like just sort
of some sort of an extra thing like not

4591
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:52,940
mean what the fuck.

4592
02:12:52,941 --> 02:12:53,840
What if it breaks,

4593
02:12:54,170 --> 02:12:54,681
you know,

4594
02:12:54,681 --> 02:12:55,400
and you're driving.

4595
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:55,550
No.

4596
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:56,050
Ah,

4597
02:12:56,050 --> 02:12:59,210
and there's no steering wheel
going straight towards the school.

4598
02:12:59,270 --> 02:12:59,960
It reads,

4599
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:02,990
it reads a speed limit sign is
like $200 or something like that.

4600
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:04,723
Let's do this.

4601
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:05,121
Oh,

4602
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:05,954
I didn't even think of that.

4603
02:13:06,080 --> 02:13:07,080
Fake speed signs.

4604
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:09,420
The newest hack.

4605
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:14,330
Well you can hack things like I was
talking about the screen in the car.

4606
02:13:14,331 --> 02:13:17,330
What I meant was you could drive 30 miles
an hour and just beat off to porn as

4607
02:13:17,331 --> 02:13:21,890
you're driving because I used to have
an infinity and I had this guy rick a

4608
02:13:21,891 --> 02:13:22,730
switch it out,

4609
02:13:22,731 --> 02:13:24,730
a DVD player and uh,

4610
02:13:24,731 --> 02:13:28,310
I had this guy rick a switched so that
it thinks that the parking brake is on,

4611
02:13:28,311 --> 02:13:29,360
so it thinks you're in park,

4612
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:32,520
so we just press the switch and you
could watch movies while you're driving.

4613
02:13:32,521 --> 02:13:33,354
You remember that car?

4614
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:33,960
Yeah,

4615
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:36,690
I was watching Bruce Lee movies when
I was on my way to the comedy store.

4616
02:13:36,870 --> 02:13:37,890
I didn't really watch them.

4617
02:13:37,891 --> 02:13:39,890
I paid attention to the
road and responsible adults,

4618
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:41,980
but I liked the fact that it was there.

4619
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:44,310
And a cop actually pulled
me over and he said,

4620
02:13:44,311 --> 02:13:44,520
uh,

4621
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:44,791
yeah,

4622
02:13:44,791 --> 02:13:45,210
you can't,

4623
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:47,010
you can't have that a
plane while you drive.

4624
02:13:47,011 --> 02:13:47,191
I go,

4625
02:13:47,191 --> 02:13:47,431
dude,

4626
02:13:47,431 --> 02:13:48,870
I don't even know what's
going on with this.

4627
02:13:48,930 --> 02:13:50,070
It's not supposed to do this.

4628
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:50,821
Oh yeah.

4629
02:13:50,821 --> 02:13:51,430
Just ask.

4630
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:52,590
Just being the backseat.

4631
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:53,670
Shit's not working.

4632
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:54,030
Sun.

4633
02:13:54,030 --> 02:13:54,960
The thing won't stop playing.

4634
02:13:54,961 --> 02:13:55,681
Bruce Lee movies,

4635
02:13:55,681 --> 02:13:56,460
man.

4636
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:58,020
Most cops don't know shit about tech.

4637
02:13:58,021 --> 02:13:58,854
So you can get away with,

4638
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:00,930
get away with lying to him about that.

4639
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:01,881
I'm terrible with that.

4640
02:14:01,881 --> 02:14:03,990
Like as soon as I see
a cop pulled me over,

4641
02:14:03,991 --> 02:14:04,461
I'm just like,

4642
02:14:04,461 --> 02:14:05,120
ah,

4643
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:05,581
I'm not even gonna.

4644
02:14:05,581 --> 02:14:06,720
Try and talk my way out of this.

4645
02:14:06,721 --> 02:14:07,554
I'm terrified.

4646
02:14:07,810 --> 02:14:08,470
Yeah.

4647
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:13,470
One thing I don't ever do is I don't ever
allow a weed to get into my car inside

4648
02:14:15,731 --> 02:14:16,420
my car.

4649
02:14:16,420 --> 02:14:16,721
Yeah,

4650
02:14:16,721 --> 02:14:19,160
because you see it smells weeds.

4651
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,960
The weird thing about weed
is when you're smoking weed,

4652
02:14:22,990 --> 02:14:24,400
you don't smell it.

4653
02:14:24,700 --> 02:14:25,840
You're smoking it.

4654
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:27,130
But people around you like,

4655
02:14:27,190 --> 02:14:27,941
God damn,

4656
02:14:27,941 --> 02:14:29,410
that's some fucking stinky weed.

4657
02:14:29,550 --> 02:14:29,861
And you're like,

4658
02:14:29,861 --> 02:14:30,694
I don't smell shit.

4659
02:14:30,790 --> 02:14:31,720
It's strange.

4660
02:14:31,721 --> 02:14:35,920
Like friends will come over and they'll
stink of weed and they don't even know

4661
02:14:35,921 --> 02:14:36,870
they stink of which

4662
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:39,713
stinks of weed.

4663
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:40,583
He says,

4664
02:14:41,050 --> 02:14:41,710
yeah.

4665
02:14:41,710 --> 02:14:45,760
See that's something like
talking to people and then
hearing their stories where

4666
02:14:45,761 --> 02:14:46,960
they like bring stuff.

4667
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:47,381
I'm like,

4668
02:14:47,381 --> 02:14:48,214
you're crazy.

4669
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:49,031
You're a crazy person.

4670
02:14:49,031 --> 02:14:50,260
I don't care how easy it is.

4671
02:14:50,290 --> 02:14:51,123
It's easy to get.

4672
02:14:51,130 --> 02:14:51,231
Oh,

4673
02:14:51,231 --> 02:14:52,660
you crazy to travel with it.

4674
02:14:52,661 --> 02:14:53,340
You know.

4675
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:55,840
That's what I'm saying is
like when you're there,

4676
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:56,950
you know,

4677
02:14:56,950 --> 02:14:59,080
like when I talked to people
that are all about it,

4678
02:14:59,081 --> 02:15:01,630
they give me these 80
step plans and I'm like,

4679
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:04,360
or you go a day without it.

4680
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:06,700
That could be cool too.

4681
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:08,620
It's not that big of a deal.

4682
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:11,500
The man tired of the man
tried to take away my.

4683
02:15:11,501 --> 02:15:12,750
We'd like if you want to,

4684
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:14,630
if you want to talk
about the TSA being like,

4685
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:15,671
like bad.

4686
02:15:15,671 --> 02:15:15,971
Okay.

4687
02:15:15,971 --> 02:15:16,570
That's great.

4688
02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:16,871
Yes.

4689
02:15:16,871 --> 02:15:17,170
You know,

4690
02:15:17,170 --> 02:15:18,670
but fucking don't,

4691
02:15:18,671 --> 02:15:21,190
don't go over state lines
with something illegal.

4692
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:24,720
So stupid because in some
places it's really illegal.

4693
02:15:24,721 --> 02:15:25,620
Like Texas,

4694
02:15:25,890 --> 02:15:27,240
if you get busted in Texas,

4695
02:15:27,241 --> 02:15:29,130
that is really fucking illegal.

4696
02:15:29,131 --> 02:15:30,030
That's something that's a little.

4697
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:31,620
There have a little while.

4698
02:15:31,621 --> 02:15:33,480
You see Congress passed this new,

4699
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:33,900
uh,

4700
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:35,870
this new approach to
medical marijuana there.

4701
02:15:35,871 --> 02:15:38,730
They're not attacking medical
marijuana at all anymore.

4702
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:40,860
They've quietly done this
over the last few days.

4703
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:44,580
There are no longer gonna prosecute states
or anybody that's involved in medical

4704
02:15:44,581 --> 02:15:45,001
marijuana.

4705
02:15:45,001 --> 02:15:47,280
They're gonna allow states
to do what they're doing,

4706
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:48,173
which is great.

4707
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:49,050
That's

4708
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:49,830
weed is,

4709
02:15:49,830 --> 02:15:52,020
it ruins old episodes of cops.

4710
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:54,580
Like that's something like
when you see like [inaudible],

4711
02:15:54,581 --> 02:15:55,890
you see some people with like crack,

4712
02:15:55,891 --> 02:16:00,110
but then like you just see a guy that
has like the smallest amount of just

4713
02:16:00,130 --> 02:16:02,010
probably like terrible weed and he's like,

4714
02:16:02,011 --> 02:16:04,350
you're gonna go to jail for a long time.

4715
02:16:04,351 --> 02:16:04,450
The

4716
02:16:04,450 --> 02:16:05,680
Zip tie his risk,

4717
02:16:05,860 --> 02:16:07,090
throwing them into a cage.

4718
02:16:07,091 --> 02:16:07,241
Yeah.

4719
02:16:07,241 --> 02:16:08,140
It's fucked man.

4720
02:16:08,530 --> 02:16:08,921
Yeah,

4721
02:16:08,921 --> 02:16:09,754
it is.

4722
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:10,991
It is strange.

4723
02:16:10,991 --> 02:16:14,260
But Obama's passing these things
until Jeb Bush gets in office,

4724
02:16:14,261 --> 02:16:15,350
then it all gets fucked that up.

4725
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:16,240
You think that's what's going to be?

4726
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:16,961
I'm worried,

4727
02:16:16,961 --> 02:16:17,261
man.

4728
02:16:17,261 --> 02:16:17,651
I think.

4729
02:16:17,651 --> 02:16:17,891
Well,

4730
02:16:17,891 --> 02:16:19,540
if Jeb Bush doesn't get no office,

4731
02:16:19,541 --> 02:16:20,770
Hillary Clinton will be president.

4732
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:21,550
It'd be,

4733
02:16:21,550 --> 02:16:22,420
it'd be one of those two.

4734
02:16:22,421 --> 02:16:23,620
It'll be Jeb Bush or Hillary.

4735
02:16:23,621 --> 02:16:24,431
I'll take hillary over.

4736
02:16:24,431 --> 02:16:25,010
Jeb Bush.

4737
02:16:25,010 --> 02:16:25,450
Yeah.

4738
02:16:25,450 --> 02:16:25,631
Yeah.

4739
02:16:25,631 --> 02:16:28,900
I think it's time for a woman president
still give her chicken chance to fuck

4740
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:29,740
up.

4741
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:30,160
You know?

4742
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:30,790
So we really,

4743
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:34,150
I think once hillary gets in and she
does the exact same shit Obama did,

4744
02:16:34,151 --> 02:16:34,841
everybody's going to go,

4745
02:16:34,841 --> 02:16:35,381
hey,

4746
02:16:35,381 --> 02:16:37,570
I don't think the president
really gets to say anything.

4747
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:41,540
It's going to go through every possible
thing and then it's gonna just go back.

4748
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:41,901
Well,

4749
02:16:41,901 --> 02:16:45,650
remember what it was all bad
bitches be used again as a word,

4750
02:16:45,950 --> 02:16:49,710
but Obama was before he got into office,

4751
02:16:49,711 --> 02:16:52,070
like the most progressive guy ever.

4752
02:16:52,250 --> 02:16:53,420
The most anti,

4753
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:57,740
like his stance on whistle
blowers supporting whistleblowers.

4754
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:59,960
He backtracked on all that shit.

4755
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:00,861
Just going to close down.

4756
02:17:00,861 --> 02:17:02,930
Guantanamo Bay never happened.

4757
02:17:03,130 --> 02:17:07,520
I mean it took forever to get out of Iraq
and then still by saying we're out of

4758
02:17:07,521 --> 02:17:08,120
Iraq,

4759
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:11,750
it's kind of bullshit because there's
thousands of fucking troops still in Iraq.

4760
02:17:12,110 --> 02:17:12,531
You know?

4761
02:17:12,531 --> 02:17:14,270
Afghanistan is still going on.

4762
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:19,480
Most of what they say never comes true
once they get into office and I think

4763
02:17:19,551 --> 02:17:23,030
it's because they can't really
do the things they want to do.

4764
02:17:23,150 --> 02:17:24,530
There's too much going on.

4765
02:17:24,531 --> 02:17:25,364
There's too many.

4766
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:27,110
There's too many influences.

4767
02:17:27,111 --> 02:17:28,160
There's too much money.

4768
02:17:28,161 --> 02:17:29,330
There's too much power.

4769
02:17:29,510 --> 02:17:32,000
I think the president has
way less power than we think.

4770
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:33,201
Well,

4771
02:17:33,201 --> 02:17:37,040
it's always rough weather if there's a
republican or a Democrat in the White

4772
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:37,070
House.

4773
02:17:37,070 --> 02:17:37,480
Oh,

4774
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:37,631
oh,

4775
02:17:37,631 --> 02:17:37,990
sorry.

4776
02:17:37,990 --> 02:17:38,510
Yeah.

4777
02:17:38,510 --> 02:17:40,700
Whether there's a student myself,

4778
02:17:40,790 --> 02:17:42,550
a Republican or Democrat
in the White House,

4779
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:44,660
like people forget about Congress.

4780
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:45,621
Like what?

4781
02:17:45,621 --> 02:17:49,100
That it can be a huge obstacle or the
reason that a president can do so much.

4782
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:50,213
Fuck yeah.

4783
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:50,491
Yeah.

4784
02:17:50,491 --> 02:17:51,210
It's huge.

4785
02:17:51,210 --> 02:17:56,210
And it's also the Republican versus
Democrat fucking mudslinging that like

4786
02:17:56,790 --> 02:17:58,230
nobody wants to give an inch.

4787
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:02,520
They're all just so
this partisan ideology.

4788
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:06,270
Whereas they just stick with the right
wing and stick with the left wing and

4789
02:18:06,271 --> 02:18:08,360
they're all duking it out for control.

4790
02:18:08,361 --> 02:18:13,170
It's just so frustrating and it's like
such a roadblock to any real progress.

4791
02:18:13,550 --> 02:18:13,821
Yeah.

4792
02:18:13,821 --> 02:18:14,140
It's,

4793
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:14,770
I don't know,

4794
02:18:14,770 --> 02:18:15,650
it's A.

4795
02:18:15,651 --> 02:18:16,381
I covered the,

4796
02:18:16,381 --> 02:18:20,960
the rnc just because I got the opportunity
and in and that was a weird thing

4797
02:18:20,961 --> 02:18:22,250
like the rnc and the DNC,

4798
02:18:22,251 --> 02:18:26,240
going to those events and just
seeing how excited everyone is,

4799
02:18:26,241 --> 02:18:31,010
but how sensitive and like you say one
thing and they'll jump down your throat

4800
02:18:31,070 --> 02:18:32,000
on either side.

4801
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:32,721
They're on teams,

4802
02:18:32,721 --> 02:18:34,640
man versus the dolphins.

4803
02:18:35,030 --> 02:18:36,050
I mean that's really what it is.

4804
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:37,550
And then meanwhile you
have people that are like,

4805
02:18:37,551 --> 02:18:38,271
I'm libertarian,

4806
02:18:38,271 --> 02:18:38,601
and they're like,

4807
02:18:38,601 --> 02:18:39,021
that's great.

4808
02:18:39,021 --> 02:18:39,351
That's great.

4809
02:18:39,351 --> 02:18:40,184
Whatever.

4810
02:18:41,090 --> 02:18:45,960
And that was something that I looked at
for awhile and when I would talk to just

4811
02:18:46,220 --> 02:18:47,240
anyone that was in office,

4812
02:18:47,241 --> 02:18:47,571
they were like,

4813
02:18:47,571 --> 02:18:51,110
you could go libertarian or you could
just be a modified version of one of the

4814
02:18:51,111 --> 02:18:51,860
two parties.

4815
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:53,030
And that's a weird thing.

4816
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:54,100
Yeah.

4817
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:54,933
Yeah.

4818
02:18:55,030 --> 02:18:55,611
I don't know,

4819
02:18:55,611 --> 02:18:55,911
man.

4820
02:18:55,911 --> 02:19:00,140
I think until we realized that were being
had across the board and that this is

4821
02:19:00,141 --> 02:19:04,010
all just a big charade that's
being put on by corporations,

4822
02:19:04,070 --> 02:19:05,600
we're never going to figure it out.

4823
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:08,630
We're never going to get
past private prisons.

4824
02:19:08,631 --> 02:19:13,631
And I mean the supreme court giving
corporations the ability to donate on

4825
02:19:14,301 --> 02:19:17,930
limited amounts of money towards
candidates and those candidates obviously

4826
02:19:17,931 --> 02:19:22,040
support these corporations ideas once
they get into office and allow them to

4827
02:19:22,041 --> 02:19:22,671
make money.

4828
02:19:22,671 --> 02:19:24,170
And a lot of times that money,

4829
02:19:24,171 --> 02:19:29,171
making that money is detrimental to the
greater good mankind or the population

4830
02:19:29,481 --> 02:19:32,310
or just people in general were.

4831
02:19:32,340 --> 02:19:33,470
We're in a weird place.

4832
02:19:33,471 --> 02:19:37,460
And I think one of the things that we're
seeing now though is transparency on a

4833
02:19:37,461 --> 02:19:38,960
level that we've never had before.

4834
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:40,580
And ultimately,

4835
02:19:40,581 --> 02:19:44,360
I think that transparency
and this distribution of
information that we've been

4836
02:19:44,361 --> 02:19:45,290
talking about this,

4837
02:19:45,291 --> 02:19:47,120
this ability to access information,

4838
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:51,050
it's going to make a really hard to
hide all the evil shit you're doing.

4839
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:51,913
Right?

4840
02:19:52,060 --> 02:19:52,540
I mean,

4841
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:55,060
there's been stuff coming
out and that's seeing that,

4842
02:19:55,061 --> 02:20:00,061
like whether someone says Patriot or
whistle blower or like not terrorist,

4843
02:20:00,671 --> 02:20:01,700
but a little bit of a.

4844
02:20:02,050 --> 02:20:02,750
what's the word I'm thinking?

4845
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:03,583
Insurgent.

4846
02:20:03,610 --> 02:20:03,821
No,

4847
02:20:03,821 --> 02:20:06,940
I'm just someone that turns on
their own country having trader.

4848
02:20:06,970 --> 02:20:07,390
Huge.

4849
02:20:07,390 --> 02:20:07,750
Yeah.

4850
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:08,583
I'm having a brain fart.

4851
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:10,300
But just like the people that go,

4852
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:10,721
yeah,

4853
02:20:10,721 --> 02:20:11,531
what we did was wrong,

4854
02:20:11,531 --> 02:20:13,390
but they had no right to put that,

4855
02:20:13,391 --> 02:20:15,980
put out that information and just
seeing those arguments and like,

4856
02:20:16,140 --> 02:20:16,770
no,

4857
02:20:16,770 --> 02:20:17,071
right,

4858
02:20:17,071 --> 02:20:19,890
like the Chelsea manning
argument or the uh,

4859
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:23,280
the wikileaks Julian assange's argument.

4860
02:20:23,281 --> 02:20:23,401
Yeah.

4861
02:20:23,401 --> 02:20:25,230
I mean those people are in jail.

4862
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:27,990
Those people did things that
everybody thinks we're right.

4863
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,850
I mean if everyone who's rational,

4864
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:32,580
you look at what Chelsea manning the,

4865
02:20:32,610 --> 02:20:35,280
the life that she's had
since she's been in jail,

4866
02:20:35,690 --> 02:20:36,210
you know,

4867
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:37,950
locked up naked,

4868
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:43,280
left in a cell cold with no clothes,

4869
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:45,750
solitary confinement for years.

4870
02:20:45,751 --> 02:20:46,351
Literally.

4871
02:20:46,351 --> 02:20:46,531
I mean,

4872
02:20:46,531 --> 02:20:48,330
that's psychological torture,

4873
02:20:48,331 --> 02:20:48,810
I mean they're,

4874
02:20:48,810 --> 02:20:53,810
they're trying to break people and this
is someone that just exposed illegal

4875
02:20:54,301 --> 02:20:59,010
activity and released information to
this Julian assange character who now is

4876
02:20:59,011 --> 02:21:01,560
trapped in a fucking house in London,

4877
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:02,491
can't leave.

4878
02:21:02,491 --> 02:21:04,200
He's in an embassy or he goes to jail,

4879
02:21:04,290 --> 02:21:04,891
but meanwhile,

4880
02:21:04,891 --> 02:21:05,730
if you had a vote,

4881
02:21:05,731 --> 02:21:08,730
a worldwide vote as to whether
or not they did good things,

4882
02:21:08,731 --> 02:21:09,900
whether it's Edward Snowden,

4883
02:21:09,990 --> 02:21:10,980
same sort of situation.

4884
02:21:10,981 --> 02:21:12,330
If you have a worldwide vote,

4885
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:16,830
what they did was that beneficial or
was it negative for humanity and I will

4886
02:21:16,860 --> 02:21:19,620
guarantee you the vast majority
would say it's beneficial,

4887
02:21:19,650 --> 02:21:19,921
right?

4888
02:21:19,921 --> 02:21:20,101
I mean,

4889
02:21:20,101 --> 02:21:24,120
the argument is that like you could
potentially put us assets at risk if you

4890
02:21:24,121 --> 02:21:25,770
just throw out all this information,

4891
02:21:25,771 --> 02:21:27,390
but it is very much,

4892
02:21:27,630 --> 02:21:28,080
you know,

4893
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:30,040
we did something wrong and you're,

4894
02:21:30,041 --> 02:21:33,600
you're putting us at risk because you're
bringing it to light rather than going,

4895
02:21:33,630 --> 02:21:33,841
okay,

4896
02:21:33,841 --> 02:21:37,680
well let's bring this to light
and let's not fucking do it again.

4897
02:21:37,770 --> 02:21:38,550
That'd be great.

4898
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:38,701
Well,

4899
02:21:38,701 --> 02:21:43,701
it's certainly in some ways a gray area
because intelligence operates under this

4900
02:21:45,390 --> 02:21:50,010
sort of a really strange blanket and
the idea behind it is they're trying to

4901
02:21:50,011 --> 02:21:53,370
protect society from the evil people of
the world and sometimes you got to break

4902
02:21:53,371 --> 02:21:54,870
a few eggs to make an Omelet,

4903
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:56,580
but you know,

4904
02:21:56,670 --> 02:21:57,503
I mean,

4905
02:21:57,510 --> 02:22:01,590
Obama's whole stance going into office
is completely contrary to what's going on

4906
02:22:01,591 --> 02:22:02,424
right now.

4907
02:22:02,570 --> 02:22:05,490
That whole whole hope and
change website that he had,

4908
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:08,280
they removed the whole
piece on whistleblowers.

4909
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:08,820
Oh Wow.

4910
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:09,511
Because it was a bit.

4911
02:22:09,511 --> 02:22:09,631
Yeah,

4912
02:22:09,631 --> 02:22:10,464
it was a big story.

4913
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:11,221
Big Story.

4914
02:22:11,221 --> 02:22:11,670
Yeah.

4915
02:22:11,670 --> 02:22:12,451
Because people like,

4916
02:22:12,451 --> 02:22:12,930
Hey,

4917
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:13,770
remember this?

4918
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:14,960
And then they like try,

4919
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:19,680
just cut that out and deleted it
and we delete it from the Internet.

4920
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:21,250
Never pop up ever again.

4921
02:22:21,370 --> 02:22:25,960
We can slowly but surely remove
it like Alyssa and tweets and

4922
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,813
she's been deleting.

4923
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:29,310
I'm sure.

4924
02:22:29,310 --> 02:22:29,731
Well listen,

4925
02:22:29,731 --> 02:22:30,564
I'm not mad at you.

4926
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:31,230
Look,

4927
02:22:31,230 --> 02:22:32,820
I'd be mad at me too if I didn't know me.

4928
02:22:33,220 --> 02:22:34,053
So good kid.

4929
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:36,000
But you know,

4930
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:37,253
it's all right.

4931
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:37,770
Listen,

4932
02:22:37,770 --> 02:22:38,460
we got to get out of here.

4933
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:38,760
Okay.

4934
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:39,480
We're out of time,

4935
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:40,380
phil to Franco.

4936
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:41,280
You're an awesome dude.

4937
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:42,210
I appreciate you coming on,

4938
02:22:42,211 --> 02:22:42,361
man.

4939
02:22:42,361 --> 02:22:43,600
Thank you very much for
having a lot of fun.

4940
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:45,900

Beautiful.
