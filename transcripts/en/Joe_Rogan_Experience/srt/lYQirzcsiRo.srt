1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,630
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,920
A lot of us get there,

3
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:03,390
right?

4
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,050
A lot of people that we know came from
a place where when they were really

5
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:08,860
young,

6
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,491
they were like,

7
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:11,710
what the fuck is going on with the world?

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,100
Yep.

9
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,400
Wait,

10
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,000
how old were you?

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,430
Do you think you were
when you had your first,

12
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,001
Oh,

13
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,550
I think my parents might
be fucking crazy thought.

14
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,241
What do you like?

15
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:21,550
These people are in charge
of telling me what to do.

16
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:22,480
This is nonsense.

17
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:22,751
You make,

18
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:23,040
you do,

19
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,240
you're talking crazy talk here.

20
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,310
It happens.

21
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,690
It happened for me,

22
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,230
uh,

23
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,050
the first time that I took a Lsd,

24
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,641
uh,

25
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:31,730
and maybe before that,

26
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:32,720
but when I took Lsd,

27
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,140
I,

28
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,580
when I took LSD for the first time,

29
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:35,820
I can remember when,

30
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,400
whenever you take Lsd,

31
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,301
uh,

32
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:39,051
especially,

33
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:39,470
you know,

34
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:39,990
I mean at the,

35
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,281
you know,

36
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:41,270
when I took Lsd,

37
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,440
what worries do I have?

38
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,940
I'm in fucking high school.

39
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,511
There's no,

40
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,470
there's nothing in there.

41
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:46,304
There's nothing to,

42
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,720
there's no demons to come swimming out
of my brain and taught me with like all

43
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:52,700
the myriad of things you
get when you're older.

44
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,560
There's fucking nothing.

45
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,300
You were just open.

46
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,560
I might,

47
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,300
I might be upset cause like a
cheerleader that came over to my house,

48
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:01,100
I couldn't figure out how to kiss her.

49
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:04,280
Maybe that's like the biggest
problem I'm having at the time.

50
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:04,910
So,

51
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,181
but I,

52
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:05,451
you know,

53
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:06,284
at that time,

54
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,770
when I did it for the first time
and had that initial experience,

55
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:10,490
uh,

56
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,970
you know,

57
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,980
when you go back to your
parents who've never taken it,

58
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,380
and if you mentioned it to
them that you'd even taken it,

59
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:18,710
they might want to put you in a drug
rehab or they think you're insane or they

60
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,180
think you're getting down the wrong track.

61
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,980
You're forced into this place of like,

62
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,053
fuck man,

63
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:23,983
I can't,

64
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,471
I,

65
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:25,910
you w you guys don't even,

66
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,310
you don't even know you,

67
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:28,760
you don't even understand this,

68
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,360
this a new way of experiencing life.

69
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,110
You know,

70
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:33,610
so,

71
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,520
and I think there's a lot of people who
spend their whole lives never knowing

72
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:40,460
that you don't have to take
psychedelics to get to that place.

73
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,960
There's other ways to get to that place.

74
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:42,980
But yeah,

75
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,510
it's a very strange thing.

76
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,490
And those people who
never get to that place,

77
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:47,540
they're the ones who are,

78
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,790
a lot of them are,

79
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,551
are in control.

80
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:49,940
Right.

81
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,940
So your life took inexorable change when
you did acid that was like the point

82
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:56,270
where you look back and you said,

83
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:58,640
this is the point where I
went off into this direction.

84
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,020
Um,

85
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,140
well I know I'd say the,

86
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:01,350
the,

87
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,820
the,

88
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,151
that,

89
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:06,230
that taking acid started
with a series of like books.

90
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,480
It started with contact with like,

91
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,763
you know,

92
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,240
the whole weirdness.

93
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,880
My whole weird weirdness started with,

94
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,290
as I recall,

95
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:20,291
it started with me coming upon this
book that my mom had called Raja Yoga by

96
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,970
Yogi Rama terracotta,

97
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,870
who by the way,

98
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,960
it was never a Yogi was
just some English mistake.

99
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,410
Okay.

100
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,810
Wide about being a Yogi.

101
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,660
But it's a fascinating story.

102
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,440
But the book,

103
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,070
uh,

104
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,371
you know,

105
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:38,270
that was the first time
I'd ever read the idea.

106
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,260
They,

107
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,950
you there that you're an
observer observing yourself,

108
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:43,670
that you,

109
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,040
you aren't necessarily the you,

110
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:46,851
that you think the you,

111
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:49,550
that can be observed is not you.

112
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,020
You're the observer state,

113
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:51,860
the mindfulness,

114
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:52,521
the watcher.

115
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:52,941
That's when I,

116
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,430
that's the first time I'd come upon
the idea of what that's called,

117
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:56,000
the amen.

118
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,070
The thing that observes yourself.

119
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:58,281
You know,

120
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:58,600
when you,

121
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,381
you know someone say,

122
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:00,910
I'm really mad right now.

123
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,490
The moment you say I'm mad,

124
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,230
you're creating a distinction.

125
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,801
You know,

126
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,260
between the thing that's
observing that you're mad.

127
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,370
And the thing that's mad.

128
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,570
So that observer,

129
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,500
that watcher,

130
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,840
that's the thing that,

131
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,860
that mindfulness is what,

132
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,251
you know,

133
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,020
throughout my whole life,

134
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:17,441
I try to,

135
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:17,921
you know,

136
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,540
go into that place of observing
myself rather than being the thing.

137
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,100
And it's a game that you can play in.

138
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:27,080
It really is quite
helpful with a variety of,

139
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:27,851
of problems,

140
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,560
especially if you get really angry.

141
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,100
If you get really angry and you can
stop yourself and just watch and there's

142
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,050
tools you can use.

143
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,431
In that book.

144
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,430
I remember it said as you walk around,

145
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,360
start thinking he is walking.

146
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,800
That was like one of the tools,

147
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,930
like it's in a book and
you're a character in a book.

148
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,380
So when you're going around,

149
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,000
you're like,

150
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,271
you know,

151
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,700
right now he's doing a podcast right now.

152
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:49,600
He's talking.

153
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
And so that's,

154
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,130
these are,

155
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,990
these are activities
designed to create this,

156
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:56,140
like the watch or the state
of presence of watching.

157
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,280
So that started it.

158
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,570
That led me to like,

159
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,500
you know,

160
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,740
I,

161
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,820
and then I found out about,

162
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,540
you know,

163
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,010
I,

164
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,500
uh,

165
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,630
I think I read the
electric koolaid acid test,

166
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,411
you know,

167
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:10,411
about fucking a Ken Kesey and the merry
pranksters blasting themselves on acid

168
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,150
and going to the world's fair in a bus.

169
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,570
And then I read that shit.

170
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:13,811
No,

171
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:14,261
I remember,

172
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:14,710
wait,

173
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,240
I'll tell you and then
I'll stop this weird,

174
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,253
weird rant.

175
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,640
I remember now.

176
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,090
Fucking filmstrip that's
what it started in my head.

177
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,820
I think I was in like fourth
grade and they showed us a drug.

178
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,050
Filmstrip remember film
strips fucking popped up.

179
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,710
This guy like it hot.

180
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,820
There's a guy I still going,

181
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:31,931
right?

182
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:32,764
It's a guy in it.

183
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,540
It's a guy in a fucking,

184
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,374
um,

185
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,900
empty apartment and he's curled against
the law and the fetal position and it's

186
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,030
an LSD and it looks terrible.

187
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,010
And then the narrator says,

188
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,950
Lsd can make you
experience hallucinations.

189
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,810
You can see dragons.

190
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,771
And I remember him saying,

191
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:51,604
you could see drag.

192
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,410
I'm like,

193
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,243
I don't want to see if

194
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,320
you see a track that sounds awesome.

195
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,170
Fuck the UPL empty apartment.

196
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,080
The fetal position.

197
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,200
I'll figure it out.

198
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,440
Sit on that guy's a pussy.

199
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,180
Like what are you crying?

200
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,470
So dragging a little bit.

201
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,130
It took acid and jigs
back in and that was,

202
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:11,401
that.

203
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:12,450
Put it in my head is like,

204
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:13,081
well you know,

205
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:16,230
I think that that's an
interesting thing to explore but

206
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,940
oh that's hilarious.

207
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,290
So you think that you were
like to Dunkin's like Dunkin
one and Dunkin to like

208
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,690
Dunkin one is like
regular Dunkin growing up,

209
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,620
innocent boy.

210
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,010
Sure.

211
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,791
Boom.

212
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,130
Psychedelics and then Dunkin 2.0

213
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:32,660
yeah.

214
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah there's definitely a Dunkin to that.

215
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,560
That happened I'd say.

216
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,191
And then that,

217
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:38,960
that Dunkin to change too man.

218
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:39,560
Cause you,

219
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:39,831
you know,

220
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:40,580
as you get older,

221
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,240
the best thing,

222
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,170
there's two great,

223
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,750
the best thing that can happen
to use you get knocked off track.

224
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,910
That's the best thing that
can happen to you in general.

225
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,090
Cause generally the track you're on has
been set for you by people who never got

226
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:53,300
off their track.

227
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,040
You end up,

228
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,411
you know,

229
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:58,790
you end up the child of someone who
decided to have you in their twenties 2122

230
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,410
they're not going to know a lot of stuff.

231
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,320
They're not going to understand the
universe that much unless they were like

232
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,850
came from a really good family
of artist are intelligent people.

233
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
Chances are they're scared,

234
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,461
hungry,

235
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,210
desperate,

236
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,960
angry.

237
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,180
They don't want to be in
the relationship anymore.

238
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:15,890
They don't want to be monogamous anymore.

239
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,340
The idea of non monogamy to
them might just seem insane.

240
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:19,701
The,

241
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:19,971
you know,

242
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,560
like who the fuck knows?

243
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,350
But you're born into that planet.

244
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,390
That's the atmosphere you're born into.

245
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,610
That's what you're breathing
when you're first born.

246
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,260
And that can set you on a weird path.

247
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,600
And that's a very sad
path that you can get on.

248
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,940
And so hopefully if you're lucky,

249
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:35,571
you'll come across.

250
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,610
Somebody knocks you off that fucking path.

251
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,061
You know,

252
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,830
I remember the guy who
hooked me up with acid.

253
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,950
I remember sitting in the theater
of my school cause I was taking,

254
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:46,700
I was at drama nerd and I sitting in the
theater of my school next to this guy

255
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,670
next to this Guy Brad.

256
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,990
And uh,

257
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,190
I remember sitting and I,

258
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,580
and we're talking and he
mentioned tripping on Lsd.

259
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:56,901
And I'm like,

260
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:57,710
what?

261
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:57,981
It's like,

262
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:58,191
oh yeah,

263
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,330
I took acid over the weekend.

264
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,164
I'm like,

265
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,990
well what you can get acid,

266
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,801
the movie,

267
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,610
the life,

268
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,200
the life of somebody must
animate this somebody please.

269
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,720
I know your folks out
there that animates shit.

270
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,280
You got to animate this,

271
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,030
that,

272
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,420
that moment took me two,

273
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:20,350
and this is really weird.

274
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:20,821
Tell me what the,

275
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:22,140
the first trip was like.

276
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,540
God,

277
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,470
I love to,

278
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,700
the first trip was it was white blotter,

279
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,380
white blotter paper.

280
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:30,010
I don't,

281
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,090
it was just white bladder,

282
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,031
a little Pete,

283
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:32,740
you know,

284
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,120
somehow if you don't know this,

285
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,890
LSD gets put on sheets which
just look like blotter paper.

286
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,060
And sometimes they have designed,

287
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:40,990
sometimes they don't.

288
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:45,310
But the name is always a reference to
usually as a reference to the design on

289
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:45,701
the sheet.

290
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:46,360
So,

291
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,600
uh,

292
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,410
you know,

293
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:47,951
purple,

294
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:48,611
Jesus,

295
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:50,320
White Blotter of lips,

296
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:50,820
you know,

297
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,890
there's a million different names
for the different types of acid,

298
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,310
but,

299
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,210
so this is just white.

300
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,991
You who knows what it was,

301
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:59,470
but it was really good and
I can remember I took it

302
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,020
and you have to,

303
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:02,201
you know,

304
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:05,050
it takes 30 to 45 minutes
sometimes longer for it to kick in.

305
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,060
I still remember I was sitting
in my friend's trailer in
a trailer park in North

306
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,140
Carolina sitting in an empty bathtub,

307
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,390
like when it like an empty Jacuzzi
tub that was in this trailer.

308
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,080
And I'm sitting there and they're
watching star wars and I'm sitting in this

309
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,260
bathtub and all of a sudden the greatest,

310
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,060
it's the greatest feeling just started
going through my legs and up into my

311
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:28,690
body.

312
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,580
And it was a fucking sword fight.

313
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,390
It was a a lightsaber fight
when I'm listening to that.

314
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:36,790
But all of a sudden now the sounds echoey,

315
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,680
like someone's turned an echo up on it.

316
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:39,010
So I was like,

317
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,131
yeah,

318
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:39,964
well,

319
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,220
you know,

320
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,580
parents kind of bouncing around.

321
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,810
It's beautiful.

322
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:46,870
And I feel so fucking
good started laughing.

323
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:47,890
It seems so funny.

324
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,990
Then I went outside and lay in the grass.

325
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm staring at the sky.

326
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,980
Everything's beautiful trails.

327
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,030
You put your hand in front,

328
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,700
your face and it's just this rainbow of
hands drifting in front of your face.

329
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,500
Everything's breathing.

330
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,260
Then my friends come running out because
they knew this is the first time I was

331
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:06,690
tripping and they all
start jumping over me.

332
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:10,650
They're like jumping over me as I'm laying
there and they're laughing and we're

333
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,290
all fucking laughing
and it's just perfect.

334
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,350
Then I remember they
pulled their cock out.

335
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,720
That's when they pulled that.

336
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,430
When we all started fucking,

337
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,820
we fucked and fucked and then a dog came
by and we grabbed the dog and started

338
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,090
fucking the dog.

339
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,340
No,

340
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,860
no know.

341
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,700
It was beautiful.

342
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,570
Very now.

343
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,011
Yeah,

344
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,270
there was no fucking happening.

345
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,340
There was a lot of like laughing.

346
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,840
There is a,

347
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,840
I remember going into my friend's shitty
high school car and like sitting and

348
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:45,300
like pulling the seat back and looking
at the ceiling and I'm looking at the

349
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:50,250
ceiling and it's fucking hieroglyphics
or some kind of like ancient writing,

350
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:50,521
you know?

351
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:52,560
I don't even think I knew
what Sanskrit was at the time,

352
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:53,370
but I'd probably be like,

353
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:53,551
oh,

354
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,690
I'm seeing Stan script.

355
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:59,130
Some kind of runes are glyphs all over
my friend's car that she's kind of

356
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,150
breathing and warping
and it's just beautiful.

357
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,230
So yeah,

358
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:04,800
that was the,

359
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,940
that was the first time.

360
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:07,890
And once you've had that experience,

361
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,560
how do you go back to a world,

362
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,970
a normal kind of world?

363
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,350
First time I ever did acid.

364
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,660
I've,

365
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,720
I've told you this
before I met Kurt Cobain.

366
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,770
How crazy was that?

367
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,633
Whoa.

368
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,270
Wow.

369
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,140
Tell the story again.

370
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,690
I think I died this night,

371
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:22,141
by the way.

372
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,210
I have this very,

373
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,520
that know that this is what made me think
of a theory that like every time you

374
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,200
die you don't know that you died.

375
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,290
But then you left this rural,

376
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,060
then everyone else in
this other parallel road,

377
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,310
you know,

378
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,240
they think you die.

379
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:33,450
Like,

380
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,070
you know,

381
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,920
went to the funeral.

382
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,690
And this is where I thought this one was.

383
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,380
Uh,

384
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,290
the first time I did acid,

385
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,510
me and my girlfriend at the time,

386
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,344
and it was Marissa.

387
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,880
We went to go see,

388
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,520
we went to go see a nirvana
and she had acid and I,

389
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,480
I've never done it before.

390
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:48,721
She goes,

391
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,250
let's do acid and see nirvana.

392
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,040
So we took acid and the
opening band was on,

393
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,191
which,

394
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:55,830
which is some Asian band that
just screamed the whole time.

395
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,490
And it was like,

396
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:56,840
ah,

397
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,120
you know,

398
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,953
it's kind of like,

399
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,531
I don't know,

400
00:10:58,531 --> 00:10:59,364
annoying.

401
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,240
So I was sitting next to the side of the
stage and Kurt Cobain comes around the

402
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,380
corner and it just comes out.

403
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,360
It like it was really dark
so no one could see it.

404
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,830
And he's just standing right next to me.

405
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:08,281
I look over,

406
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:08,491
I'm like,

407
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,540
oh my fucking God,

408
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,410
it's Kurt Cobain.

409
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,131
And I was like,

410
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:11,281
Hey,

411
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:11,701
what's up?

412
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:12,001
And he goes,

413
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:12,600
hey,

414
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,460
you went to Chico?

415
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,020
And he like,

416
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,180
like hold out his bag.

417
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:15,511
And I'm like,

418
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:15,791
yeah.

419
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,780
And then so I held on the cheeto
and then suddenly he just like,

420
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:19,171
somebody goes,

421
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:19,801
oh Kurt.

422
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,070
And then he just like throws all the
Cheetos out in the crowd and the,

423
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:25,000
they cause returns backstage and I'm
holding this cheeto and I'm like,

424
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:25,840
drew the Cheetos.

425
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,490
The crowd.

426
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:26,641
Yeah.

427
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,290
Like he had a bag of Cheetos
that he was eating for him.

428
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,430
He just threw it at the crowd.

429
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:29,910
Yeah,

430
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,110
he just threw Cheetos everywhere.

431
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,590
I mean it was,

432
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,050
this is like a mosh pit in Dayton,

433
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,700
Ohio side of the stage,

434
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:36,570
like a rock club,

435
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,290
you know,

436
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:37,831
hair arena.

437
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,920
I think it was a fucking video of
Dana white getting in a mosh pit.

438
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,803
No,

439
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,040
he went to a range in the machine,

440
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,770
rage against the machine concert
and motherfucker got an a mosh pit.

441
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,330
She gets security guards were going out
for him when she jumped in a mosque.

442
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,580
So I took this cheeto and
I put it in my pocket.

443
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,201
I'm like,

444
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:57,550
I'm going to save this Cheeto,

445
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,200
you know,

446
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,320
uh,

447
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,153
and then I start,

448
00:11:59,170 --> 00:11:59,561
you know,

449
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:03,040
tripping really hard and hadn't was
that amazing concert on the way home.

450
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,900
We're driving and we go by in like,

451
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,110
I'm driving it and this
is a thunderstorm or rain.

452
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,050
I'm still tripping,

453
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:08,884
tripping,

454
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,843
tripping on acid.

455
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,090
And then this is even better.

456
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,800
And I swear to God that you could ask her.

457
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:15,581
I'm not going to say who she is.

458
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,091
I'm on here,

459
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:21,040
but we started fucking while I was
driving in the rain storm on acid for my

460
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,874
first time,

461
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,790
you fucking baby and that's where
I think I died the first time.

462
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,930
One of the first times I died.

463
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,213
It might be okay.

464
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,830
Oh Shit,

465
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,310
iTunes or recording to
server the fuck outta here.

466
00:12:59,311 --> 00:12:59,850
Server.
