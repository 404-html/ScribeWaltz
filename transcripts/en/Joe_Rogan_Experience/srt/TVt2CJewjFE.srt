1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,023
All right,
here we go.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,650
Boom. There we go. So, uh, first
of all, welcome. Thank you.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,890
Thanks for doing this. Appreciate
it. Thanks for having me. John.

4
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:21,710
You are fucking documentary me that
that might've been one of the craziest

5
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:24,080
documentaries I've ever seen in my life.
The seven five,

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,730
if people haven't seen it. Um, dude,

7
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:32,530
what a fucking crazy life you lived. Jesus
Christ. Do you feel lucky to be alive?

8
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:34,620
You're embarrassed.
I'm embarrassed because you know,

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,510
I'm looking at people that's supposed
to be Spec to law enforcement and,

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,640
and it's almost, you know, almost slept,

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,200
almost glorifying some of the crazy shit
we did. I don't think it's glorifying.

12
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:47,440
I hope not. No, it's definitely
not. I don't think it is. It's,

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,480
I think it's an honest portrayal of
people going off the rails because they

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,370
didn't have the, I mean that you had
the ability to do so, you know, I mean,

15
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:59,020
that's what it was. You right. I mean,

16
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:04,021
it's just untamed and the ability to
get away with things that you could,

17
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:09,280
no one else could. Well, I think we're
seeing today with law enforcement,

18
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:12,670
with all the stuff that's going on with
all these kids getting shot and all

19
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:16,270
these, all this, these
videos that get taped of,

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,250
of police abuse.
We're seeing that for the longest time,

21
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,170
this stuff just wasn't filmed, that there
was a lot going on. We've all witnessed,

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,910
I'm sure you more than anybody,

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,930
but we've all witnessed some cops that
were out of control and that I think

24
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:36,160
that's just what happens when people
have power and you just kind of,

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,530
they get a little crazy. They, you know,

26
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:42,550
when you don't have anybody checking
that power and then on top of it and your

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,480
situation,

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,020
there was cocaine and there was crime
and there was all sorts of craziness.

29
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,880
I mean, I learned about your
documented from Nick Depalo.

30
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,840
He was on my buddy Ra should fear show
and he was raving about this documentary

31
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:59,050
and it wasn't even out yet.
It was your preorder it on iTunes.

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,510
I fucking hate that.
When you want to watch something

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,240
calling me like in the middle of the
night, where is this documentary?

34
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:09,920
I can't get it. I'm like, Oh, let me
call the people at all three media.

35
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,980
And you know, like they don't give a fuck,
you know, dentist, they're just like,

36
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,740
I was sleeping right now we're
on California time. I said, okay,

37
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,790
well they're not awake yet.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,410
Ruinous. What did nick see? Like a
prescreening or something like that?

39
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:22,490
Did he see it in the movies?

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,970
Um, I don't know. I think, I
hate to say this on the air,

41
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:26,950
but I think he pirated it as

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,610
that's illegal because he had heard
about it and he couldn't get it.

43
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,880
And I was like kicking the ground saying,
you know,

44
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,510
who's promoting this God damn thing.
They, you know, it's about my life.

45
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,330
And people asking me a lot of
questions about it and I'm like,

46
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,420
why don't you go see the documentary
after like a week of trying to get it.

47
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:49,550
Then they throw your hands in the air
and they're like, we can't get it.

48
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:52,400
So a lot of frustration over
the way it was distributed,

49
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,160
but I wasn't involved in it.
So I walked in that pot,

50
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,960
I white knuckled my way through.
That whole thing was in touch.

51
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:02,230
Shut that off once I'm to tell you, you
and your audience how, I mean I'm a,

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,620
I'm a nut like, sorry,
I love adrenaline shit,

53
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,630
but I really couldn't
sit through most things.

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,380
And when the movie was
premiered the first time,

55
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,570
it was seen ever by myself as well.

56
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:17,890
I sat by the door thinking that
one I'm going to be bored or too,

57
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,890
I'm not gonna like the, the content in
the movie and just leave the theater.

58
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,640
And uh, and my family and some friends
were there, you know, not everybody,

59
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,870
but you know, select
people showed. And uh,

60
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,890
I sat by the door and like
in a minute and a half,

61
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,900
I just turned around in the
seat and didn't fucking move.

62
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,790
And it's hard for me to do.
I mean,

63
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,600
you'll see throughout this practice
conversation here, I'm all over the map,

64
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,380
but have you always been all
over the map? Um, uh, you know,

65
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:44,110
I think it's the Brooklyn, the
expressiveness with the body, you know,

66
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:47,100
we speak more with our body then
our mouth. For some reason I don't,

67
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,220
maybe short tongue down the line
and your English language, but, uh,

68
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,490
just the way we, I don't know, being a
cop, you always watch your back, you know,

69
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:58,980
so it's a lot of, uh, you know,
I don't know how to explain it.

70
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:00,610
It's just that's the way we speak.

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,060
Now, this is a very well done movie, but
excellent. The subject matter itself,

72
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:07,380
the actual story itself,

73
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:12,120
the facts involved in the story are
fucking completely insane. I mean, you,

74
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:16,860
you guys, um, you were
involved in so much craziness.

75
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,160
It was head of control, but here
you are. You're out on the street,

76
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,550
you're doing podcasts, you know,
you're doing press for the movie. Yeah.

77
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,160
You know, it's got to feel weird
for you to have gone through that.

78
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,270
It's different lives, you know, in the
way I see it. You know, I was a young,

79
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,910
young boy, young man, police officer,

80
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,100
convict inmate Parolee,
and at now I'm somebody else.

81
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,380
It's just weird how, you
know, Nikki Chameleon,

82
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:46,130
you'd just change with the environment
then that's how you adapt and overcome

83
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:48,440
anything is you should have to learn how
to live within the environment you're

84
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:53,090
in. And it seems like that's, that doesn't
seem the same. First of all, you know,

85
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,560
let's be real.
I was 23,

86
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,010
24 years old when most of these incidents
took place and then they carried on.

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,400
Uh, the, the more detailed,

88
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,600
the criminality took place later on
as I got closer to my 30 year number.

89
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,940
But you told him I'm 54 today.

90
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:12,020
So my perspective on everything I did
and my perspective on the world today is

91
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,420
way different than it was back then.
You know?

92
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,470
Yeah. Whenever I tried to watch a
documentary about people doing crazy shit,

93
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:22,940
I always imagined myself like, what
would I do if I was in that situation?

94
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,000
Like how, how would I have
reacted if I was a young man?

95
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,100
And I probably would have been right there
with you. Yeah. You know, it's, it's sad,

96
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:31,840
but

97
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,370
no, it's sad about that is it's people
given the opportunity to do wrong and they

98
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:39,160
can get away with it.
You have to ask yourself this question.

99
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,310
If I could take that 200,000 lodge right
now and just plain out question and

100
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,530
never have any negative
consequences happen to me now,

101
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,350
I'm not saying because she broke the
moral code of policing and all that shit.

102
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,470
I'm just saying just be a normal
human being. Woke up. Fine. 200 lodge.

103
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,910
No one's going to miss it.

104
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,340
It's not yours and you're never going
to have bed calm or anything happened to

105
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,750
you.
Would you take it?

106
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,950
It's a good question and you don't
need it until you're right there.

107
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,130
No one's eating no one even no one even
knows except for one person that it's

108
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:12,110
theirs and it depends on where you are
in your life. You're broke, you got kids,

109
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:15,140
you got a mortgage, yet you have
rent to pay, your car's broken down.

110
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,190
You've got no gas money.

111
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,820
If you're a 55 year old man and you
have a happy family and you have a good

112
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:20,191
career,

113
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:24,530
you make a phone call and probably do
something nice and you get on the news and

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,780
look at this Michael Dow, what a gentleman
gave away $200,000. He founded a bag.

115
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,240
Well, I didn't know what to do with this.
Not a good, my life is good, you know,

116
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:38,030
and in a house on the hill and you're
on blow. And I saw pop popping that.

117
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,000
Um,

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and also it's interesting because you
are constantly around people that are

119
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,730
making insane amounts of money and they're
doing it by breaking the law. Yeah.

120
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:54,410
Let's, let's, let's focus a little bit
here. This is the 1980s crack epidemic.

121
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,250
Aish New York, right? So no action
I do was justified. Okay. Right.

122
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,510
I did wrong and I paid the fucking price.
I hope it'll pop.

123
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,310
Some people want me to FALive some
people want me dead, but you know what?

124
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,200
Fuck you too. Right? I'm here.
I'm out. I did my time. I served.

125
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:13,010
It's straight up. I walked the track
by myself for 12 fucking years.

126
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,750
Kiss my ass goodbye.
Okay,

127
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,430
so now I am here to talk about
the stories that made the story,

128
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,440
the seven five what it is.
I didn't bring this upon myself.

129
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,910
I mean the actions and all that.
Yes.

130
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:26,660
But somebody approached me from Hollywood
want to do a documentary about this

131
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,960
mission? Coolum Mollen Commission.
I told it's a piece of shit deal.

132
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,680
Do a story about the boys from the seven
five and I think you'll have a good

133
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:36,590
movie. So what was the original thing
they wanted to come to you about?

134
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,380
Well I was the main focus,

135
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:43,190
which is a thread throughout
the documentary is that
there was these hearings

136
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,590
called the Mollen Commission,
which if people know history,

137
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,840
they can go back to the KNAPP
commission when person, a person,

138
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,930
a surface hub protocols.
The guy that did time with Colombo family,

139
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:58,931
but so Serpico was a cop gets shot in the
face and the movie Serpico and in fact

140
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:05,090
he actually commented on
this, a documentary to
Tila, Russell, the director.

141
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,270
I got to, I don't know, it's two in
the morning. Cause these guys out here.

142
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,190
Don't know what fucking time.
It's two in the morning. My,

143
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,450
my text message goes off cause it's 10
30 at night, 11 o'clock at night to him.

144
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,530
I just got a phone call from Serpico
saying it's the best movies ever seen in

145
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,580
his fucking life. Wow. You know,
and I'm like fuck cervical,

146
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,630
cause I really don't like
second go to be honest with you.

147
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:27,530
Cause he said some nasty things
about me one until he was a rat. So,

148
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,930
but you know, he says, well Mike, he's
a but Americana, he's history, you know.

149
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,730
And so I got to give him his props.
I said fine,

150
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:38,030
but I really don't want to hear it.
He liked my movie so fuck him.

151
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,510
But he's not against them really.
But you know,

152
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,630
certain people would keep at a distance
and he's one of them that I would choose

153
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:48,130
to and I shake his hand and say,
you're a good guy. Serpico the,

154
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,340
he ratted out other corrupt
cops. Is that what it was? Yeah,

155
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:56,670
he did the right thing.
Yeah. No one liked the book.

156
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,330
I mean that's the way it is. Right.
What's that movie accurate that I'll,

157
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,070
but you know, movie. I can't look, I
wasn't there, so I have to tell him,

158
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,310
what is the word? It's a word
that it was accurate or, um,

159
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,280
the word is that the shooting was not
quite the way they said in the movie

160
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:14,260
itself, but he turned into
partners, you know, they what?

161
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,970
They wanted him to take the money and he
wouldn't take the money. And you know,

162
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,330
he was in transit, Jen about it
and someone shot him in the face.

163
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,720
Now that I've been in the building
half a dozen times at nine or precinct,

164
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,250
they actually shot another movie there
by a black. There's, I can't think.

165
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,120
What's interesting is your partner,
when you were,

166
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,480
your partner in this film turned you in,

167
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,940
but he was involved in a lot of it with
you and he never wound up doing any time.

168
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,380
Yeah. I mean, this story can go
many different directions here. Um,

169
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,850
Kenny was, let's consider a good cop.
You know, he was there to put the money.

170
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,120
What was his last name? Kenny
row. He was there for the money.

171
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,820
He would make college.
He'd lock of everybody's a husband,

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,080
like you would have a fight with your wife
in the ghetto and this was like daily,

173
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,140
daily thing, you know? And he would go
there and lock you up and take you out.

174
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,500
That was his gig. Yes, he
did that for years. That was,
that was his overtime money.

175
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,380
And I told him,
I don't really like to do those things.

176
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:13,740
And we got together and he had to like
a specialty. That was your specialty.

177
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,250
Domestic violence.
Ironically. But Anyway, oh,

178
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,030
tp term. There's this story
ironically. I see. Yeah,

179
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,050
I understand what you're saying. So there
was not something, you know, he says,

180
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,180
so, um, so he would arrest these guys
and how would he make money doing that?

181
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, you'd, over time, every arrest
would lend you at least eight,

182
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,410
sometimes 16 hours of overtime to ping
upon what time you made the arrest. Oh.

183
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:40,921
Show.

184
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:44,940
He'd be able to make the arrest and go
to sleep for fucking 12 hours and make it

185
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:48,800
six, $700 on someone's misfortune. And
you know, they may have been legitimate.

186
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,020
You're rested and not saying they weren't.
Yeah.

187
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,370
So how would he make money off of going
to sleep? I don't understand that.

188
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:57,930
So when you are waiting to book a, uh,
a prisoner slash potential inmate, you,

189
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:02,190
uh, you have to wait for hours and
hours and hours so you can sleep on,

190
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,150
on newspaper racks, boxes in the
hallway. It was central booking.

191
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,450
Central booking was like
a mash unit. Really? So,

192
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,480
so your arrest the guy and then
you go take a nap somewhere.

193
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,580
Well that's how it was. Wow. Yeah. So
you would get paid to lock somebody up.

194
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,700
So that's why the city was against
arresting drug dealers. Okay.

195
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,670
This whole thing turns into
a whole conundrum here.
Like that word. Anyway, um,

196
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,010
the crack epidemic caused the city to
go broke in many ways because you'd have

197
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:36,900
police officers arresting people for minor
drug offenses that were, it was crime,

198
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,000
you know, and comps supposed
to arrest people for crime.

199
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,390
So what happened was of course so much
to process and arrest that they would

200
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:45,960
sort of discourage you. And by that
mean they wouldn't say don't do that.

201
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,380
That would never in policy, but you would
find yourself on a foot post somewhere.

202
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,060
Like I would get the post down in
Vandalia, uh, by the weeds. Well,

203
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,100
it was drag racing there

204
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,270
at night and that was it,
you know?

205
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:58,630
And so I would get like high allergies
from standing in the weeds if I made

206
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,670
arrests for drugs in railing.
Yeah.

207
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,300
So that's how they would discourage you
from making arrests and just to save

208
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,790
money. So, well,

209
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,330
would've bureaucracies exist for
profit and loss, but that's it.

210
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,550
They don't exist for the people.

211
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,430
We as police officers supposed
to serve the people, you know,

212
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,500
and then you'd come out of a
system that's not the it for them,

213
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,430
did it for themselves. So were you
there before the crack epidemic?

214
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:24,490
And I was there just before the
crack epidemic started. In fact,

215
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,690
we didn't know what it was. We used to
people just because we get drug calls,

216
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:32,140
you know, so you taught someone,
what the fuck is this from an it out,

217
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:33,700
we know what it was.
Wow.

218
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,210
And then one day one of my partners
brought it home and he came back with like

219
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:40,600
$500. And so that's what that shit was
last night. Or what is it? He goes,

220
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:42,340
it's cocaine. You know, you
gotta be fucking kidding me.

221
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,860
You've been throwing this out.
Wow.

222
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,060
Then that was a 84 or five slash five.
Yeah.

223
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,680
I remember hearing about it because I
was in high school at the time and people

224
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,330
started talking about crack.

225
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,130
Like you would hear it in the news crack
epidemic and then there's violence and

226
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:04,020
crime epic when you heard about it
because Len bias, that's right. Yeah.

227
00:13:04,021 --> 00:13:04,854
In Boston at the time,

228
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,880
he was the basketball player that was
drafted by the Celtics and he never played

229
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,900
a day. Cause after he got drafted and
they gave him this big signing crown and

230
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,550
everything, he went out and
partied, did some crack,

231
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,010
had a bad heart on top
of it and killed himself.

232
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,500
So Ted Kennedy put these laws in place,

233
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:24,010
which would have to urban kids in federal
prison for fucking life sentences,

234
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,420
which now Obama's rightfully
in many cases, rightfully
undoing. And, um, you know,

235
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:32,080
that's a big political issue
that we, yes, it is. We get
into it, but, well, it was a,

236
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,820
it was the only thing I agree with him
on. Is that Ted Kennedy? Yeah, no. Oh,

237
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:41,050
Obama. Obama. Yeah. Well that's a big one
to the war on drugs is one of the most,

238
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,520
well, it's not, it's ridiculous.

239
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,730
They should just get rid of old rug
Lewis and let people go to rehabs. Yes.

240
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,900
Or they'd be no money in it. I agree.
I mean simple. Yeah, exactly. Well,

241
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:53,630
I mean they've known that since the
organized crime epidemic of the, the,

242
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:57,940
the prohibition, right? Shit. That's
what empowered, organized crime.

243
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:59,380
The ability to make shit tons of money.

244
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,270
That's what's going on
down in Mexico right now.

245
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,000
They're making money off the fact
that drugs are illegal in America.

246
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,230
When this was all going down for people
on the outside, like me, you know, I,

247
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,250
I had heard about it, but I didn't
know how much of it was real. You know,

248
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:16,480
you hear things about the news
and the news being, you know,

249
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,660
they blow things out of people are
showing to turn people into criminals.

250
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,060
It really fucking look at us.
I mean we were good guys.

251
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,480
Most of us were good guys from hardworking
families, cops, firemen, you know,

252
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:30,250
blue collar people, you know, sanitation
work is, um, bus drive is plumbers,

253
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:31,930
electricians and he became a cop.

254
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:36,310
You thought you were still in the same
genre of, of, of blue collar and you know,

255
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:40,390
you, you were the ones that the beast
was a quilt. We equated to Beirut.

256
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,960
It was like going to fucking Beirut
and you know, and, and supervisors,

257
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:47,500
which just happy that you with that and
like, and that we can hold a home today.

258
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,250
So, you know, so he took odd 10, 20
grand. No, no one really gave a fuck.

259
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,800
The problem was when people
start complaining and make noise,

260
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,810
then it brings attention. So when, when
you're there, before this is happening,

261
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,093
what,

262
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,600
how much different was the environment
that you were policing before crack and

263
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,900
after crack? It was, it was,
it, it was noticeable warm.

264
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,480
It was like a fucking tornado came in
and ripped the fucking community right

265
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:15,090
apart. Now, don't get me wrong, it
was, you know, urban ghetto that, that,

266
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,980
that to survive the 60s and the turmoil
and all that stuff, and you had your,

267
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,550
your, your racial breakdowns
within communities. But

268
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,310
I got there and I want to say 83 I
don't sell my fucking, I'm old now.

269
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:33,311
So I got there in 83 84 so it was there
about a year and a half and it was

270
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:37,640
getting crazy because coke was expensive.
Coke was 50,

271
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,410
50,000 a key. So it was tough for
the university community to have it,

272
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:46,940
but it was around.
And then when it dropped down to like 15,

273
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:50,300
20,000, 14,000 kilos, of course,
a crack and the volume of,

274
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,010
I guess whoever was bringing in,
you know,

275
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,080
there's many theories on who was helping
bring and I didn't back then. Um,

276
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,920
it just,
everybody can now get it.

277
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,820
And everybody now experience the,
you know,

278
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,300
the studio 54 high now
the kid in, in, in, in,

279
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:09,820
in the city was experienced for five
seconds. Mang goodbye. Oh, I loved it.

280
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,020
Now they're looking for the next hit
and it was just such as rock was.

281
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,900
It was blood on the streets everywhere.
It's fucking ridiculous. Wow.

282
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,820
Now when you go every day, every day,
every day, you just saw just gun shots,

283
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,220
stabbings and shootings every day. Wow.
It was, it was, it was exciting. Yeah,

284
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,850
I'm sure. And it's fucking great.
Well that seems like part of it to me.

285
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:34,250
Like when I was watching
this, I was like, Jesus,

286
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:37,700
it seems like in a way you're
kind of having some fun. Oh,

287
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,500
I have taught every day.
I didn't want to miss work.

288
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,620
I hated fucking three day swings and
the cops will listen to this date.

289
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,691
A lot of cops hate me,

290
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,270
but they sort of respect
me in a way because they
understand not respectful what

291
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:51,770
I did.
My honesty,

292
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:54,110
I hope that's what they take from this
because then you got a lot of cop fans

293
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,010
and shit like that and I respect you
in the [inaudible] guys, you know?

294
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,660
And most of them have really good guys,
but they get it.

295
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,780
It's the ones who get what I'm talking
about that will appreciate this

296
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:06,770
conversation. You and I haven't, well I
think if you're a cop in Orange County,

297
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:08,930
in Europe,
a police officer in Irvine,

298
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,030
you're dealing with the little
bull shit here and there.

299
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,260
You got to kind of know that is a big
fucking difference between that and east

300
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:16,850
New York in the 1980s during the year.

301
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:20,450
I hope not deal cause it got done and
he got to know what's the difference

302
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:24,170
between,
I mean it seems like it wasn't just you.

303
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,120
It seems like your entire precinct was
kind of full of shenanigans, but let's,

304
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:32,840
let's put it like this and this is a
take. Nothing away from the, at that time,

305
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:37,841
let's let's say 90% w w all legit guys
going to work with their lunch pail and

306
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,310
going home and live in
waiting for the next paycheck.

307
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,880
I used to get my paychecks because I was
making so much money. That's the truth.

308
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,730
And that got me in trouble by that
started this whole investigation on me.

309
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:47,960
It was because he forgot your paycheck.

310
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,430
Kept forgetting to pick them and
you pull up your corvette. Yeah.

311
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,300
Was the lieutenant spot. I pulled it
and that sort of pissed him off. Um,

312
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,310
you know, sometimes you wanna
make a point like, fuck you.

313
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,040
He's trying to take my girlfriend
away. Fuck you. Parking in your spot.

314
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,890
You're not getting her on the spot now.
That's hilarious.

315
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,410
Uh, so it was just, it seemed
like it was a lot of fun.

316
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,800
Like there was this one,
one case where you guys are talking about,

317
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:18,420
we kept circling the block. Let's not
get a better story. That, that was fun.

318
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:18,991
That was fun.

319
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:23,991
But I'm going to cheat sheet
with me because I got like
600 stories here and I'm

320
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,280
working with a guy named rob.
See you right now.

321
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:30,870
Him and I started to collaborate on,
we're going to do maybe the book again,

322
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,160
you know, we got to put, please do. Well,
this is a process. You know, how things,

323
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,240
you know, you've been probably
through this yourself personally.

324
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,850
We got some people in. Uh,
but, uh, I'm talking with,

325
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,950
with dealing with Sony a little bit
with trying to get this thing right.

326
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:44,731
I think rob Sia,

327
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,880
who's an ex New York City cop
who's done a couple of bestsellers,

328
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,600
he might be the right one to put the
whole thing together with me. I can speak,

329
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:54,060
he can write, he knows the color
in the middle. Right. You know,

330
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:58,170
we're a writer and uh, could, could make
it happen. Especially since he was a cop.

331
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,340
It was a cop and he's
got some credibility.

332
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:04,530
He does the Gotham comedy show in
Manhattan. I don't know. They run,

333
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:09,570
they run some live shows sometimes
live from golf on TV. Yeah, he does.

334
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,920
He does a lot of that stuff until
he's involved in that. So He's,

335
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:16,050
he's got some credibility as a common
cause he does he do stand up? No,

336
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,320
he's just, he's in the productions
of part of it and stuff like that.

337
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:22,350
But he's a writer a and he
wrote two bestsellers. Uh, so,

338
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:27,220
well I think we're going to have him talk
with, what's his name? Less sure. Less,

339
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:31,010
you're from the gun, unless
you, I think his name is,

340
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,520
he's got the academy award list.
Oh, okay. So, uh, we're gonna have,

341
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:37,860
we're gonna have a little discussion.
Him and I,

342
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:40,440
and about doing a month or
something about the seven,

343
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,260
five movies at Sony owns the rights.
Right.

344
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,460
We'll just try and make it
work right now, you know. Uh,

345
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:47,340
so there's a lot of discussion going on,
on making it come together properly.

346
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:52,090
So Sony owns the rights to do a dramatic
recreationary creation. The 75. Yeah.

347
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,620
Wow. Okay. Yeah. You
got to do a book though,

348
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:59,340
because I got to imagine there's just
no way they're going to jam that big to

349
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:04,230
tell you a funny story. So I'm, I'm on
patrol in Brooklyn and I'm working with,

350
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:06,690
um, I can't remember. It could have
been Kenny. I don't fucking know.

351
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:10,650
I don't care cause I'm just telling you
from my perspective and a down the block

352
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,990
comes, uh, this guy chicky
chicky is in the movie,

353
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,880
he's Pis and uh, he's in, he's in
the back of his trunk of his car.

354
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,430
The trunk is wide open in the back.

355
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:23,130
End's got to choke a poker machine
in the back of his car. Right.

356
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:27,540
The patrol car shut the joker
poker machine. Uh, people rambling.

357
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,960
Gambling machine. Yeah, you, you put
your money in and they don't pay out.

358
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:34,150
But they do pay out if you know the
right people behind the counter there and

359
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,841
you know,
so it's,

360
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:37,650
it's a gambling device that you can get
away with gambling or not. You know,

361
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,530
we hand out candy instead of the hand
out money it depending upon who the

362
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,370
patriarch. I see. Okay. So with
back in the 80s that was the game.

363
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,010
So we're driving down the block and he
comes to sergeant. He's driving this way.

364
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,510
I'm driving this weight.
I helped him load the machine into the,

365
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:53,500
into the back of a
patrol cop cause it's heavy.

366
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,750
It's about a thousand pounds,
this machine.

367
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,110
So we load this into the
back of his patrol car. Then
up pulls the Sargent. Yeah.

368
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,150
Sarge has no idea what's going on.
It's like, what's going on? Oh,

369
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:06,790
this guy pissed me with chicky. He did.
Should I say? And this guy pissed me off.

370
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,240
Who'd you know, the guy
behind the counter? You know,

371
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,950
he made me pay for solar as something.
Meanwhile,

372
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:15,650
he's got illegal joker poker machines
in his store. So chicky says,

373
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,920
that's it. These your machines.
He goes, yeah, the owner
of the patron of the store.

374
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:24,910
He goes, yeah, that's my machine.
So he says, okay, he takes the shit,

375
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,620
blows him in the back of his car.

376
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,010
He can take them home and empty them out
cause it's a $4,000 in quarters in the

377
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:33,670
machine. Right. So He's, the guy
made him buy a soda for a dollar.

378
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,700
Now he's going to take all the quarter
that a machine. So He'd come to sergeant.

379
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,180
So cars driving by, he's on probation,
cops going to probation, they pay us,

380
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,690
then he moves state patrolman, steady, uh,

381
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:47,590
sergeant gills from patrolman to sergeant.
And then he's on probationary period.

382
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,200
So he comes inside and on probation.
He's,

383
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:53,110
he's just four or five year veteran cop
would've with a joker poker machine in

384
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,890
the back of trunk of his car.
And he goes, what's going on?

385
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,540
He says,
Oh,

386
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,850
the guy pissed me off side and I'm not
letting him do this illegal gambling shit.

387
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:04,380
And then maybe there's everywhere.
Every fucking store has one, right?

388
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,350
So it's this, the 600 stores, this six,
that's 6,000 machines in the precinct.

389
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:11,410
But this one's got to go, you know, so, so
on and says, what are you doing? He says,

390
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:13,060
I'm taking, he goes, why
would the guy pissed me off?

391
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:16,630
He was rude and disrespectful and uh,
and it, this is illegal. It's a crime.

392
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,460
We got guys getting shot, murdered,
stab, selling crack on every corner.

393
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,030
He's taken this guy joker poker machine.

394
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:27,550
So that's how insignificant these things
normally are. So the, it's like chicken.

395
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,490
He may have disrespected you,
he may be pissed off,

396
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:34,390
but you gotta put it back please. It's
like, he's like, why? She goes, Oh,

397
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,960
I'm on probation. I don't need any
problems. So ps, we go, okay. So I,

398
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:42,220
besides no problem, bring it
back to chicky. Turns around
and looks at me. He goes,

399
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,880
all right. So as we're putting it back,
we drove back to the store. So I left,

400
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,690
went right from his, right from the stuff
from the store to chickies apartment.

401
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:52,210
Like you said you wanted to
apartments before anyway,

402
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,890
he had an apartment
local in the precincts.

403
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:56,950
We went to the apartment up the joker
poker machine offers his apartment.

404
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,900
I mean these are things we would do,
you know,

405
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:02,800
because just because you
could just because he could
cause you could what seems

406
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:04,840
like it was just,
there was a lot of excitement.

407
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,860
Like I'll do an all that like every
driving around the block store was my

408
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:12,310
favorite. Because you were driving around
the block for like an hour and a half.

409
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,100
Yeah. Well cause it, cause chicky
could, didn't get there in time.

410
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:18,390
He didn't have a car. Chicken had left
the job because of all the investigations.

411
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,180
It, you get that from the
documentary. So I needed someone,

412
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,930
Kenny wasn't available so I don't even
know if I was working with him yet.

413
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,880
You know, he'll say he probably was,
but whatever. Anyways, so he check,

414
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,320
he had his car in the shop being repaired.
So I'm like,

415
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:35,830
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
I need someone now with a car and a badge.

416
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,380
That's all I need. So I didn't want to
lose sight of the house in case you know,

417
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,660
for people who haven't seen
the documentary, what was
going on? What, what house?

418
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,440
There was a burglary call at house.

419
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:49,700
So we responded as patrol rifle and we
checked out the place and inside was two

420
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,400
young girls who uh,

421
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,160
were sitting there on the floor in this
home and it was a door knob broken off

422
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,420
and they said that they
were given permission by the
owner of the home to spend

423
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:02,930
the afternoon or day here in her home.
I'm aware, I had asked her, where did,

424
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:04,560
where did the owner happened
to be since you, you know,

425
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,060
you broke the door in order to get in.
Oh, she's in prison right now. I said, Oh,

426
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:12,080
and for what? And she goes, well,
I think for drugs. I said, okay,

427
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,300
thank you. So I turned left hard
and there's a box of fucking shoes,

428
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:20,750
piles about to shoes. I, if anyone
knows anything about the drug business,

429
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,050
they spend a lot of money on their
personal issues because what else are you

430
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:25,070
gonna spend money on?
You know,

431
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,740
you can't build a new house in the
ghetto here that she's just wasting your

432
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:30,860
money, but you could have a lot of
shoes. So I see all these boxes of shoes,

433
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:33,200
nice high heels, pumps, all
this stuff. So I said, okay,

434
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,310
it's a girl and he has spent a lot of
money on shoes and the furniture looked

435
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,450
pretty good for the location.

436
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,180
So I opened the closet and he has a
fucking duffel bag filled with cash.

437
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,390
I pick up actually that's really
not exactly what happened.

438
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,200
Some anti crime guy went in there,
picked up the big, he looks at me,

439
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:52,270
I look at him and go,
what are they going to do?

440
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:55,370
A voucher this come out and spend
all day in them. I leave it there.

441
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,060
He looks at me, he looks at me,
he goes out, he puts it down.

442
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:01,400
I put my hand in the bag and start
stuffing the money in my pockets.

443
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,490
But I had no room. I didn't have enough
room. I was wearing summer clothes.

444
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,211
I didn't have,

445
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:09,140
I went to uniform on with the jacket
where you can stuff everything. So anyway,

446
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,280
I said, this is not going to work.
It's too much money here. You can't,

447
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,790
you can't run out of a building with a
big field with money and have the cops

448
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:19,440
see you because they're gonna say
we had the bed go. Right, right.

449
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,300
So my enemy was the cops at this point.
So you know,

450
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,490
I found a way to circle a house for
an hour and a half and every possible

451
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,960
direction you could and it,

452
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,900
and then chickie finally pulled up with
another guy that was retired from the

453
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:30,734
jail.

454
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,860
They walked in with their Duke badges on
and the landlord lets them in and yeah,

455
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,790
up there. That's it.
Just, they just left that,

456
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:40,960
built that apartment right up there when
he went in and come out with the bag.

457
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:43,610
And about a minute later I pulled him
over, boop, boop. Pulled them over.

458
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,900
How are we doing? Real good. I
go, what are you going to use?

459
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,630
That's called Atlantic city. I go, great.
I go back to the cell phone, cell phone,

460
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,400
I go back to the payphone on the corner.
Back then we had the original call form.

461
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,660
You would drive the patrol car up on a
curb and just reach out to the fucking,

462
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,540
uh,
at t and t phone booths.

463
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,520
So you'd sit in a patrol car and dial
the precincts right out of the precinct.

464
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:09,400
It was a free call by the way. He didn't
have to pay for it. And uh, and uh,

465
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,710
it, boy, my wife, it needs to
be at home right now. You know,

466
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:14,720
one of the kids broke a toe or
whatever, you know, whatever excuse,

467
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:18,130
you can come up with it. Okay, no problem.
Come in and you can take less time.

468
00:26:18,131 --> 00:26:20,840
It's called the lost time. So, uh,

469
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,330
I told the girl in the car I was working
with who was an IED plant by the way,

470
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,140
she was, she was internal affairs plants
sitting with me the whole time. I said,

471
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:28,680
okay. I says, you know, I kind of go home,

472
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,850
my wife just page who
had beepers back then.

473
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,100
My wife just page me the kid's
sick or something. And, uh,

474
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,700
so I went back to the precinct,
signed out,

475
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,540
went to Atlantic city in the
limousine and so cleaned the money.

476
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,890
The girl who was driving around with
you as you were going around for an hour

477
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,010
and a half was a plant. Yes, she

478
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,870
was internal affairs comp. I don't leave.
I ever told anybody that. But yeah,

479
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:49,990
she was an internal affairs comms.

480
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,520
So did she get suspicious that she asks
questions while you were driving around

481
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:56,790
in a circle? I told her, I said, just in
case someone comes back and breaks in the,

482
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,340
you don't want to see these people's
House get being sacked. The money,

483
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,780
she didn't know there was money in there
otherwise she would probably bounce you

484
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:04,130
to write. Right. We didn't
let her know that. Right.

485
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,640
But did you know she was a
plant or jazz so you knew? Yes.

486
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,650
Wow. Very good job of
hiding the plant. In fact,

487
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:15,060
I had a beer would have two days before.

488
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
It seems like all this
stuff that you were doing,

489
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:22,000
all these criminals that you
were dealing with, like the, the,

490
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,020
the heightened sort of environment that
you were in must've been very addictive

491
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,090
because it was just so much going on.
There was so much action.

492
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,330
It was,
listen,

493
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,770
when you're 28 years old and you drive
into work and you've got the nerves on

494
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:41,010
one side of your body freezing up on the
other side from the ahead to your arm's

495
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:44,310
going numb. Yeah. There was a lot
of shit going on. Why was it going?

496
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:46,140
I don't know if it was from
the coke or from the nerves,

497
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,930
just because she didn't know it was
gonna happen from one day to the next,

498
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,470
but you just couldn't get out of it.
The stress must have been insane.

499
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,800
It was insane. It was. I pull up on
the side of the road and say, okay,

500
00:27:55,801 --> 00:28:00,470
if I die over here, it's okay. They'll
find me. I'm like, that's how crazy it.

501
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,210
So if you die from a heart
attack, I didn't know what, okay.

502
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,510
I didn't know what was going to be
driving to work. I'm just not sure.

503
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:10,500
So I just feel my body's starting to
go out, so I pull off to the right.

504
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,900
So it didn't hurt anybody. And I'm
thinking very conscientious here. Right.

505
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,750
That's weird. Wow. So there
was so much going. I mean,
how much coke were you doing?

506
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,810
Not that much. You know, I was just steady
bumper. I wouldn't do a lot, you know,

507
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:26,850
she's doing it all the time. Yeah. So
it wasn't like giant lines like that.

508
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,910
I'd be dead. Yeah. I don't know how
they did it. Well, I tried that once.

509
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:34,120
It almost killed me. When you
were testifying in that film, uh,

510
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,230
w that was one of the more intense parts
of that movie because you were just a

511
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,250
hundred percent open,
100% to your own fault.

512
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,280
Do you think you should have some things
that you should never fucking mentioned?

513
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:50,720
It's like what? Like with the girl
and the money under the fucking Bible.

514
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,660
Excuse me. God, you know,
I'm still scared of God.

515
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,560
I ask him for forgiveness every
day, you know? But, uh, you know,

516
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,540
that was the most horrific thing
I ever did. I think, you know,

517
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,970
the thousands of things I did, I took
some someone's $340, whatever it was.

518
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,280
I don't know. I don't know. Kiss
Kenny. He counts it better than me.

519
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,670
But was it just seemed like it
seemed almost for you at the time,

520
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:15,210
like when I was watching it,

521
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:20,070
like you were just so overwhelmed
with the pressure of everything,

522
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:23,610
that it was almost a relief
to get everything off your
back when they locked me

523
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:26,580
up when they hit. But if I tell you
how the investment down, it's insane.

524
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:27,414
But anyway,

525
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,410
when they finally put me in the car
and tell me I'm under under arrest,

526
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,250
it was like a, I can go to sleep.
Really. I can actually sleep.

527
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,910
And funny thing of it all was, you know,
and this is a little touching maybe,

528
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:41,980
but we're not, but I'll try
to be lighthearted. Yeah. I

529
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,600
call my wife when you county jail
and she goes to me, I'm like,

530
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,840
please don't take this the wrong way.
She says,

531
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,450
but I had the best night's sleep in my
life list cause I knew what you want and

532
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,620
you gotta be fucking,
yeah,

533
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,060
that's hilarious. I don't know.
It was, I knew where you were.

534
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:03,080
I knew where you where. I know she
slept like a baby. I had roaches

535
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,920
pulling in and my, he is, but yeah, it's
all good. How much of what was going on?

536
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:11,000
Did she know about? She only knew what
I was doing wrong for the most part.

537
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:15,620
And she knew there was drugs involved,
but she didn't never touched it.

538
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,280
Got Involved in it. You know, she
just begged me every day. Stop.

539
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,940
But it seems like you kind of can't.
It's hard.

540
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,020
Does anybody ever go corrupt
and then just go cold Turkey?

541
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:30,950
Like a heroin addict glitch
story? I tried. Did you?

542
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,580
I called internal affairs. Really?
Yeah, it was a cop. How old were you?

543
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,930
It was a cop. Like I was in the
middle of my hay day. I said,

544
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:40,370
I'm gonna have to stop
and turn over a new leaf.

545
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,750
My son was born and I had to become
a responsible father. I said,

546
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:47,330
and this is not going to work
out doing what I'm doing, right.

547
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,550
So I was in Coney island,

548
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,740
which is where I think the movie's
going to start if they do it the way I

549
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:55,350
suggest. Uh, I'm in Coney
island in front of the, uh,

550
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,190
Nathan's right by Nathan is
this a the bumper car station,

551
00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:59,600
wherever he goes and
drives the bumper cars,

552
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:01,880
they bang into each other and
it was a rainy, rainy summer.

553
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,580
They might have been 30 good days and the
rest of the lousy for the whole summer.

554
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,690
And this was one of the days that it
wasn't. And uncles, this Mercedes Benz,

555
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:13,190
the guy in the car with a gold rope
chains, the whole drug package going on.

556
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,890
I just turned my head to my
partner and I said to him,

557
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,840
look at the fucking gold one,

558
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:21,170
this guy's neck now he's got boombox
going on those big wolf and everything,

559
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,600
convertible Mercedes, that's all I said.
All of a sudden they hear Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo,

560
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:30,560
Yo and I don't turn it for y'all,
y'all, y'all, y'all for nobody. And, uh,

561
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,390
but I hear the footsteps
feel the weight of it,

562
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,030
and I just glance back and I
see a shield in the guy's hand,

563
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:39,920
the big black dude monster. I go,
what's up? What do you want? You know,

564
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,510
you don't know where the fuck y'all
yet, but it's what I, Whoa, Whoa,

565
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,060
what's going on? He goes, you said, I
asked you can I park here? And you said,

566
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,020
can't you read? I said, where'd
that happen? That conversation,

567
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:55,940
all I did was turned him on. He was a
cop. Yeah. So he was undercover and then,

568
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:00,530
no, no. So he was a corrupt, comes
into Epcot. Wow. I didn't know this.

569
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:01,840
I didn't know him.
So you thought he was right?

570
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,300
I thought it was a drug dealer.

571
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,390
All I was doing was complimentary
about the comment and the book,

572
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:11,800
the package he had, you know,
the whole goal and the hopes,

573
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,560
the girls had the hoops with the dollar
signs. And it was, it was the package.

574
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,730
The girl had hoops with dollar
signs. That was the, you know,

575
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,050
those are the past. Any
girl, the dollar sign,

576
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,870
that's my kind of girl [inaudible] sleeve.

577
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,820
It's pretty clear where this is
going. Right, right. So anyway,

578
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:35,780
so he doesn't know you're a cop.
I'm in uniform. What? The island.

579
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:38,780
I was sent to Coney island detail cause
I was in trouble and east New York.

580
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,020
So giving you a hard time and he knows
you're a cop and I'm in uniform and he's

581
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:44,720
giving me a hard time, a very embarrassing
moment because you don't do that.

582
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:46,750
You don't pray,
you don't punch each other out like that.

583
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,940
Cause now you create a scene where
something has to be, you know, mediated.

584
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:54,890
So he's probably coked up at the
very, I'm not going to answer for him,

585
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,040
but he's whacked out. Let's put it that
something's going on. What's going on?

586
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,090
He's full of himself.
He's full of self important switch.

587
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,690
The fuck is he think he is
when he's talking to me,

588
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,680
talking about self importance.
Right. So anyway, he uh,

589
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,180
he makes us big scene and
I can't squelch the scene.

590
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:14,180
The sergeant comes and it's over
with. Okay. What about a week?

591
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,180
I could tell the story of different ways,
but the fact there's a couple of days,

592
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:20,540
couple of weeks later go by, I'm out
sick, which I should be home in my house,

593
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,850
but I'm out.
I just left the beach with my wife.

594
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,370
I'm driving home from the beach and I
see this call Paul because I'm on 11 by

595
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,430
the gross from the cleaners,

596
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:30,680
which is known for having a
crack spot above it anyway.

597
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,030
And it's his call and this is
fucking name on the license plate.

598
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,250
That's how we know that
the color stands out,

599
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:39,530
but it has his name on the license plate.
You can't fucking, you can't miss that.

600
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,470
And I asked my wife, I says,
what does he look like?

601
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:45,890
Get a good look at them cause I
didn't want to, I didn't want to stop,

602
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,230
turn around, make it obvious,
but I could see him, you know,

603
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,620
I've seen him a few times and I'll
get with them for 20 minutes. Anyway,

604
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,520
long story short, I go home,
I quilt internal affairs.
They brushed to my house,

605
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:57,230
joke from Bali,
the guy in the movie that says,

606
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:58,790
you get the hair on the back of his neck,
stood up.

607
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,770
He comes in my house with Lieutenant Ma.

608
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:04,160
They start grilling me about
my fucking life. I'm like,

609
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,660
I called up on a guy selling drugs. No
wonder why no one 12th to people. Anyway,

610
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,270
the tenant moss into Joe Trembowla
out of the house. And uh, I go,

611
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,840
is this about me?

612
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:18,410
It cause I just get a fucking lawyer
and I don't know what's going on.

613
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,440
I called you because some guy was selling
crack around the neighborhood. He goes,

614
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:23,180
well, how do you know he's selling
crap? I said, look, I don't know,

615
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:26,330
but he's in a crack spot and he's
a cop. So I'm telling you, right.

616
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,360
So I want to turn over a new leaf.
Start my new life. I got a new baby.

617
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:33,560
I think it gonna be good now. It'd
be a good cop. Four weeks later,

618
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,130
three weeks later, I'm getting calls
at midnight and whatnot. Midnights,

619
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,400
two in the morning.
I'm getting closed at three.

620
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:40,400
I work six to two shifts at Coney island,
three o'clock in the morning,

621
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:44,400
my phone rings, nothing, nothing,
nothing. This went on for about I,

622
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,920
if I say three weeks,
it could have been two,

623
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:47,840
whatever it went on for an
extended period of time.

624
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,460
Finally get the guy to talk one day
and I go, but what the fuck, man,

625
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:55,100
why don't you just come out
with this? He goes, he goes,

626
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,090
I'm banging your wife every day when she
gets off the train in Brentwood. I said,

627
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:03,590
really? That's nice. Yeah. When she comes
home from work, she don't work, man. Yeah.

628
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:05,840
Okay, so she's, so he
goes to train from work.

629
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,780
You picking her up and prep when you're
banging her? He goes, yeah. I said, okay,

630
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,080
so what else can you tell him? I says,
well, why don't you come to my house?

631
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:14,600
I tell him, and we just do this since
you seem to know where I am. He goes,

632
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,670
why don't I put a bullet in
your fucking head right now?

633
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,900
He tells me that I'm standing in front
of a plate glass window. So I'm like,

634
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,560
meanwhile my wife screaming
and they'll fuck what the fuck

635
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,480
you're fucking this whole thing.

636
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,150
So now I'm sucking sand out of the bottom
of my rug and trying to stay alive.

637
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,480
Oil into the back room with,
with my son and my wife was sleeping.

638
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,550
They're not in anymore. And
I'm like, I can't believe this.

639
00:35:42,551 --> 00:35:44,880
This guy's fucking heat. He knows where
I live and he's got gotta be a cop.

640
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,790
I don't know that he,
until that moment I realized,

641
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,880
cause no one has my number and cops can
get each other's number by calling the

642
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:51,714
precinct.

643
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,110
I wanna get in touch with Joe and so
I want you to touch with so and so.

644
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,730
And we have a private numbers
in the Internet in a log.

645
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,890
It's a precinct that you can get my
number right if you need to speak to me.

646
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,420
It turns out that he was already arrested
and he was out on bail when he's doing

647
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:07,260
this to me. So it was the same
guy, single chain guy, same guy.

648
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,420
So here we are trying to turn over a new
leaf. You asked the question. I didn't,

649
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,770
I didn't pose it as you said.

650
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,730
So what you went cold Turkey like a heroin
junkie and tried to start from there

651
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,730
while I did and look what happened to me.
I they threatened to kill me.

652
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,280
They threatened to kill me. That's
the beginning of it. Then they go.

653
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,690
Then I leave the Coney island detail.

654
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:27,060
I'll go back to the seven five
and no one wants to work with me.

655
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,800
So if you'd go to the documentary here,
Mike's no good. Stay away from him. Nikes.

656
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,470
No good. He's this. They didn't want to
work on because they heard I was a rat.

657
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:39,660
What gave up a cop for corruption
night? He wears a wire. I never did.

658
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:42,390
By the way, Ken. He's good
with them. I never wore a wire.

659
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:45,270
I never Gayley gave up a
good cop or cop that did it.

660
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,940
Got was selling drugs on the fucking
long island trying to do the right thing.

661
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:51,100
Turn them in. I know they're looking at
me for drugs, but not no more. I'm no,

662
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:53,040
but when we're involved with drugs,
I gave up the game.

663
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,560
I wanted to be straight so you can't go
straight is what I'm trying to tell you.

664
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,360
Once you get labeled in
the police department,

665
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,670
you're done because no one would
work with me cause that was straight.

666
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,230
Well no one wanted to work with you
because they thought that you were

667
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:06,600
untrustworthy because you
were turning this cockpit.

668
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,170
Well that's what I'm telling you. Right.
But they would never admit to that.

669
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,200
They go every, anybody you talk to
the house, there's no, he was raw.

670
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:14,034
He was corrupt.

671
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,760
But the fact is they wouldn't work for
me because they were afraid I was going

672
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:18,900
to turn them in.
And if you hear in the documentary says,

673
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:21,030
well Kenny says we don't think you
turned me in for is having a beer.

674
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,470
You mentioned that Mike and I had to be
together and I could just walk away from

675
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:27,240
this partnership and they
put us in the farm together,

676
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,000
which I went to the farm three times,
so I'm pretty good. But the farm too,

677
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,020
what's the farm? The farm is where you'd
go when you go for Rehab. You know,

678
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:39,000
like if you need help, you're
like a intervention. Like
to do interventions today.

679
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,290
Right. Well they do. They did farms back
then. You went farms. He went to the farm.

680
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,790
Like an actual farm.
Yeah.

681
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:49,791
He would go to the farm like where cows
were cows and they had a fish pond.

682
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:54,300
They had hay fields and shit. And
what would you do there? Just relax.

683
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,550
You dry out. You know, there was a place
for mostly alcoholics, but you know,

684
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,150
and they called it the farm. It was
called the farm. Okay. Yeah. Cool.

685
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:06,780
Hops would go there too. You'd
be in rehabilitation. Okay.

686
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,450
But it was known as the farm,
right? Yeah, it's, well,

687
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:13,210
it's really renowned in the police
department. In Lingo. Okay. Yeah. So,

688
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,420
so I went to the farm three times in
like nine months. Wow. I needed to,

689
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,970
they were after me too. You know, they
were fucking hard on me and him up.

690
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:23,410
Two of my friends just went to prison.
Walter, who was in the phone, you,

691
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,970
they went to a prison for a robbery. They
committed. It was Walter the big guy.

692
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,190
Yeah. Wealth is the monster. Yeah.
Yeah. Always helps having a giant cart.

693
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,610
The fluff, the fluff is good. Was a
pretty sharp guy too. But you know,

694
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:39,640
he was young and dumb to, you know,
he, so he wound up going away,

695
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,400
did chicken and a short beard.
He did like two years and he came home.

696
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:46,240
Chicken went away for nine months and
then they came back and he needed work.

697
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:51,240
So I felt find them work different times,
you know? Right. He went to work for,

698
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:55,450
for, for Adam as one of my point men when
I was off, I put chicky on the, on the,

699
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,010
on the clock. So if I want it to
go home, do my, you know, go home.

700
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,970
They have to work.

701
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,550
I'd have chicky cover the next six or
eight hours a shift that they would be,

702
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:08,290
the Bodega would be open selling their
cocaine. Now that's where it gets crazy.

703
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,640
The boat day, that's where it gets, but
that was when you guys escalated. Yeah.

704
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,220
Well that's all we got really
little cocaine dealing. Yeah. Yeah.

705
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,700
Well what it was was w w the
handwriting was on the wall that,

706
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,710
cause the 77th suit went down for shaking
down local thugs and drug dealers. And,

707
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:31,270
uh, the rumor was that seven five was
going down. So we stopped doing that.

708
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,720
I went to Coney island, half the guys left
the fuck at the precinct to just quit,

709
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,840
quit the police department and
chicky one of them. And, um,

710
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,240
when I came back to the 75, no one
wanted to work with me. And, uh, in fact,

711
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:45,190
not one of my first days back, I hook
up with Walter, who's a rookie kid,

712
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:46,670
didn't know anything except that,
you know,

713
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,810
he liked to make arrests and get involved
and shit. And then I'm like, dude,

714
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,370
you don't know who I am.
I just don't mind.

715
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,300
I just want none of nothing
to do with this stuff. And um,

716
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,990
he's like, yeah, I'll, I'll make the
arrest that they look at him like, Hey,

717
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,900
you're going to really stop crime in here.
You can make an arrest for a fucking,

718
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,410
for a drug. Okay, good. But I want to do
with it cause I don't want the attention.

719
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:07,020
Meanwhile,
Joe Trembowla to guidance following,

720
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:08,950
he's across the street
watching us interact.

721
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,970
So time I call,
that's a long story.

722
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:16,300
I called for the sergeant to give us a
scratch so he can be done for the day.

723
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,020
Scratching me.
He's the sergeant comes by a note,

724
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,130
give you notification that you were on
what you're supposed to be. I'm asking,

725
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,670
exploding to give us a scratch just by
calling something over the air and not

726
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,830
asking for the scratch cause
that would be inappropriate.

727
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,890
But I been calling him a car license.
Blatant sergeant shows up.

728
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,070
It gives us a scratch with done
for the day. I get my private car,

729
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,850
go to the Bodega pickup for
Hamburgers and eight pack.

730
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,560
A little nip bud lights of,

731
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,120
no they weren't but the regular
bucks back then and the,

732
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,810
so I was following us the whole time.
He's watching the store list. Shit,

733
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,680
I'm over now.

734
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:47,750
I'm over in the other end of the precinct
because one of my favorite but they

735
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:51,740
get from, makes a nice burger. And,
uh, we came back to the spot eight,

736
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,960
eight this stuff through the shit out the
window because it was the ghetto in it.

737
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:57,280
It's what you do like an asshole
instead of respect in the community.

738
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:59,110
You're fucked the community. Cause
you're an idiot. You know, you're dumb.

739
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,280
You're dumb, young and
dumb. So I threw the six,

740
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,010
the 12 eight pack of
beer is out the window.

741
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,700
And so I didn't see this flying out the
fucking window. He goes and grabs it.

742
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,530
Cans. Now he's going to call me in and
investigate me for drinking on the,

743
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,120
on the job. But Walter stood up and said,
no, we didn't have nothing. He goes,

744
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,300
I got the fucking kids. He goes,
well, they weren't ours. Uh,

745
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,160
what the hell was mud early on?

746
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,640
So I gotta I gotta you gotta love them
so they could have lost his job because

747
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:26,641
he was on probation when you guys started
dealing with the guys who owned the

748
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,610
Bodega. That's when the
documentary gets most crazy. Right.

749
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,160
And that's when it seems like you
guys had escalated, did gone from

750
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,370
just taking a little money here and there.

751
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:39,470
And having some fun and
going to Atlantic city.

752
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:44,370
Now you are deep with deep
and serious drug dealer.

753
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:49,600
And that's why, you know why when I had
the meeting with Diaz I said, listen,

754
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:52,430
you're gonna have to just to talk to
what you got to pass money cause I don't

755
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:55,000
know where this is going to go, but I
know it's going deep. Right. You know,

756
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,820
so I kind of put a number, 24,000,
don't ask me why he didn't say 44,000.

757
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:01,640
I have no idea. I just,
I think I, in my mind,

758
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:05,030
I broke down like this three months
clear pay for each of us, you know,

759
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,790
right at the taxes at that time we
probably would've cleared, you know,

760
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,600
do the math, you know, 3000
a month, whatever it was at
that time. And I said, okay,

761
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,430
so let's have three of
four months of Clia pay.

762
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,160
So if we get jammed up
we can survive like that.

763
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,220
That's the number I came up in
correlation to something like that.

764
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,160
So it was in case you got jammed
up right away. Yeah. Okay. Um,

765
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,180
brilliant, brilliant thinking. Right?

766
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,490
Knowing that something was not
going to be good at that of this.

767
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,820
And where's that guy now?
He's in like the Dominican Republican.

768
00:42:30,821 --> 00:42:33,690
I can get them on the phone if you
want. Really? Oh, I get them. All right.

769
00:42:33,691 --> 00:42:37,180
And it was fucking hilarious. He's
one of the best, oh, shaking him.

770
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,490
Speaking to him. He asked me to
give you this. Oh really? Yeah.

771
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,480
I don't know if he likes her. I do
like cigars. What kind of this? Yeah,

772
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:49,100
this is the Adam d as king of Brooklyn
Cigar. What? He's got his own cigar.

773
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah. Uh, we just started in the
development process right now,

774
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:55,340
but if you check out the label,
you really can't see it well.

775
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
But as a picture of him with a unit brow,
he,

776
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,310
did you ever see the movie hit
with you at the university? Yeah,

777
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,080
I respect to commitment to a
unibrow. Yeah, he was. Yeah.
Yeah. I think he's good.

778
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,550
Yeah. No, no, they're, they're
uh, the tech tobacco letter
in the Dominican monkeys.

779
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,660
The delicious you smelling me and Marty
had one smoke. No, no, I wouldn't do that,

780
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:17,420
but I would that delicious. That's okay.
We can smoke and we've got a little,

781
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,370
if you wanted to we could. All right,
let's do it if you want it to. Yeah,

782
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,200
I've got a knife shaming. I don't, I don't
know her scissors. These are delicious,

783
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:28,880
by the way. I don't have
a clipper, but, so he,

784
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,530
but he's a fucking character.
That guy,

785
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,330
that fucking unit brow.
That's, that's a commitment.

786
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,990
I tell all pussies today.
You've going to tell you the story.

787
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:42,760
We're comfortable with blacks in
the ride to like a bitch, but pluck,

788
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,650
pluck, I shave. Do he really shaved
the middle right in the middle.

789
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:47,840
Otherwise I might have to
have more hair there than now.

790
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:49,930
I don't know what happened. I think
from doing this all the time. Yeah.

791
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,420
From frowning. Which is it just your
word off? Yeah. Well maybe from the Mat.

792
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:58,880
Maybe get that show that defense defense.

793
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,870
A funny story with Adam and I think most
people appreciate this. I hope they do.

794
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,710
Uh, I had him pay me 8,000
a week right now and um,

795
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,490
I don't see him for two weeks now I'm
getting fucking nervous. Right, right.

796
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,230
What do we got? Oh, Paris. Hey,

797
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:17,070
go and fuck happened to these two guys.
What are you doing?

798
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,690
Checking crazy when I'm out here.
So Adam d as in,

799
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,370
I haven't seen each other in two weeks.

800
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,980
I'm getting a little annoyed because
I want my money. I want it on time.

801
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,850
And part of the deal was whether
you're making money or not,

802
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:31,000
you're paying me because we've
already opened the door to,

803
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,100
I'm going to start living

804
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,620
the life. Right. And uh,
can, can you open it by?

805
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm going to start living. I couldn't,
my, my neck is killing me. What's wrong?

806
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:43,920
I got, I got two vertebrae
out of banged up there.

807
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,400
Someone probably agree I to run away.
No, I hurt myself at work. Right? Yeah.

808
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,600
Just recently. So Adam did. So anyway,
I haven't seen this guy and he's,

809
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:57,090
and he owes me now two weeks. Right.
Okay. And if you learn anything about me,

810
00:44:57,091 --> 00:44:59,640
I don't like to be old and I
don't like it. Oh, I like to pay.

811
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:02,160
I like to be paid on time and
I'm always early. So anyway,

812
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,110
um,
I,

813
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,200
I finally see him, uh, uh, I've seen him,
he's got the Red Porsche, I mean nine, 11,

814
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:12,940
Targa 22 years old,
right?

815
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:16,770
Yeah,
go ahead.

816
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,620
Nine 11 title, but blonde hair, blue eyed
Dominican, 22 years old, convertible air.

817
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,630
He goes down a new lots avenue.
We had new lots in Vermont,

818
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:27,930
that meat in this little
a triangle and uh,

819
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,820
so on Kenny's with me in the car at
the time for probably the first time he

820
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:33,654
wants.
But anyway,

821
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:38,263
he's pretty good.

822
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,370
I just love the fact that I'm smoking,
not do it cigar. Yeah, I guess

823
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,350
so. So I pull him over and uh, he goes,

824
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,210
he doesn't know who it is.

825
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,830
So Diaz is getting pulled over by
the police in east New York and,

826
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,980
and I'm just hook.
Right.

827
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,690
But he doesn't know that it's me because
you don't reckon I always use this blow.

828
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,400
Right. This tall guy and he's
sitting down low on the porch,

829
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,063
trout

830
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,600
license, registration, insurance, got,
he's fumbling around looking for a shit.

831
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,100
He probably doesn't have anything,
but anyway,

832
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,243
so

833
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,080
he's got a Dominican pants on is nice
loaf is, he's this sharp looking kid.

834
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:21,230
He was fair, always dressed to the nines.
He looked good and finally he goes,

835
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:26,320
I looked at him and go, Adam, it's me. He
goes, Mike, he jumps up out of the car.

836
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,630
What the fuck have you been like? I'm
annoyed. I'm annoyed, but I'm being nice.

837
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,840
What have you been? I
was in Yale. Yale. Yeah.

838
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,400
Don't jail. I go, wait, hold on.

839
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:45,190
Just the only thing I can coin in my
life that I know of. So I go, yeah,

840
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,970
you're in Yale. He goes, yeah. I go, how
long were you in Yale? He goes, three,

841
00:46:48,971 --> 00:46:52,570
four days. You're up in the
l three or four days. I said,

842
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,010
who do you know when Connecticut,
I swear to Christ.

843
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:02,110
Who Do you know in Connecticut?
He goes, Connecticut. I go, yeah,

844
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:05,920
Yale is in Connecticut, the college.
He goes, no, no, no, not college.

845
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,270
I was in Yale, Rikers island.
He says that perfectly. I go,

846
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,230
you mean jail? Not Yell?
He goes, yes. Yeah,

847
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:18,580
like a son of a bitch. So I think
I coined this fucking term jail.

848
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,160
Not yet or yeah. Not Jail. Agreed.

849
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,610
This is 1987 88 how long have
you been hearing Otero? Yale.

850
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:30,190
Not Jail. Yeah, we have a
jail. Not Yale. No, I heard 34

851
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,180
seconds ago. So here's the thing. Yeah.

852
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,690
So here's this guy,
Shane.

853
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,580
I

854
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:42,360
wasn't it in Yale. I was in Yale.
I'm like, you mean jail? Not, yeah,

855
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,380
you just can't say jail. Say it. Yeah.

856
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,160
Well if he texts me all the time and
then he goes instead of going, ha ha ha.

857
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,450
He goes, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay. Yeah.

858
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:57,320
They do that all the time. What
is that? He goes, ha ha ha.

859
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,680
That's so strange. Yeah. That's how you
know Spanish people and making fun of you.

860
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,290
Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay,
Jay, Jay, a. Okay. Yeah.

861
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:11,410
So anyway, so just, you know, you can't
make that up. You know we're, well, yeah,

862
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,030
I'm thinking he's in college,
right? Because he's a sharp kid.

863
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,330
Why didn't you automatically assume like
I did that he meant he meant? I said,

864
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,550
I'm not as sharp as you,
but you're around Spanish people.

865
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:24,320
All the cheese out in the fucking street.

866
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,990
He's out in the street driving a Porsche.
He was in jail.

867
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:31,090
But who the fuck let them go. The guy
sells kilos of mine. Second. Well,

868
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,190
how did he get out? I don't know. I
didn't want to ask too many questions.

869
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,530
I just wanted my money and you
want to hear or learn about me?

870
00:48:36,531 --> 00:48:38,810
I don't ask a lot of questions cause if I,
if I don't like the answer,

871
00:48:38,811 --> 00:48:42,020
I'm going to get really
fucking mad. Right, right,
right. Well I want the money.

872
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:47,180
But dealing with a guy like
that and dealing with an
organization like that, you,

873
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:51,020
you had to know that, okay,
now I've taken this giant step.

874
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,940
I'm involved with a serious murderer,
cocaine dealing.

875
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:58,280
Motherfucker like this is horrible.

876
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,370
Yeah, it's horrible. It's horrible.

877
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:07,000
You sell your soul and you know,
what's the, what's the safe I can,

878
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,040
other than this, I, I got a little
annoyed with them. Right. So I get,

879
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,940
I'm not living at home anymore. My life
is a disaster, a complete disaster.

880
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,190
It's like, well my wife
up, I says, listen,

881
00:49:19,191 --> 00:49:21,500
things aren't going too good on you
want to, we want to get back together.

882
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:26,210
I want some stability in my life. Right.
So she goes to me and I'm okay from here.

883
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:33,310
Oh No. She goes, I'm okay from
here. And uh, so she goes, um,

884
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:34,910
I go,
listen,

885
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,990
I'm going to Dominican Republic and I'm
going with this woman I'm seeing at the

886
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:42,530
time who was a police officer,
sweetheart girl. Anyway. And uh,

887
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,910
I go, what'd you, what'd you come with
me instead? She goes, take all right.

888
00:49:47,911 --> 00:49:48,744
Have a good time.

889
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,110
Can wife telling me,
wow.

890
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:59,010
Wow, what a good kid. That's
a good woman right there.

891
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,180
I ruined everything I touch
anyway, so I hope my son, you know,

892
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:06,570
sometimes like,
I think adversity makes some women better.

893
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:11,190
There's some women that like to dealing
with the, uh, no offense, asshole husband.

894
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:15,300
Sometimes it just makes him
a better person. They just,
they learn how to learn.

895
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,460
They learn a lot.
Yeah.

896
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:20,130
Cause they're sitting back observing
this whole disaster town place. You know,

897
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,930
cause they're trying to
stop you. Anyway. Listening.

898
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,200
Yeah.
So I go to Dominican Republic,

899
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:29,870
right and thanks and I'm on a,

900
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:34,230
I'm on the plane and this guy,
would it be um, well groomed.

901
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,580
He's making small talk with us being the
girl and he's got some moment with him.

902
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,010
I was like,
I'm on vacation.

903
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,650
I'm not going there to fucking
rob anybody or make any deals.

904
00:50:43,651 --> 00:50:46,110
And going there to see my
Dominican drug kingpin and see,

905
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,630
see if we can get the money pipe
glowing again, but a little,

906
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:49,680
just this destroy it yet.

907
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:53,640
Now my income's cut way down to
only make them out to 3000 a week.

908
00:50:53,641 --> 00:50:54,600
I was getting six,

909
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:57,820
7,000 a week between his payoffs and
all my other shakedowns going on. Yeah,

910
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,470
I was doing good now and get a little
tight, you know, I got fucking four homes.

911
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,410
I got a kid I want to put away for
his college. Sorry I never made that.

912
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,680
But anyways,
yeah.

913
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,270
So there's a lot of things like I plan
to you and he's fucking it up right now

914
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:11,910
cause he's hiding in Dominica.
Right. So I'm going to see him.

915
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,950
So I got off the plane and
they're speaking Dominican
to meet these people and I

916
00:51:16,951 --> 00:51:20,200
could speak a little Spanish. Uh, so I
said you'll swipe police were bullies.

917
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,980
[inaudible] got anyone
taxi or [inaudible].

918
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,850
Uh,
and Casa de Campo,

919
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,680
I'm talking to a cop and uniform as
a sergeant stripes on, right, right.

920
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,810
The cab drivers stuck,
beating them up,

921
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,260
start beating the copy and the grabbing
and pushing and trying to knock them out

922
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:41,100
in a way because they want to take the
ride and I want it to this guy cause he's

923
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:42,400
thinking he's a cop.
He's to mediate for me,

924
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,870
get me the right price
because I know to take you,

925
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,310
it'll take advantage of the
green from America. Anyway,

926
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,370
I ended up ducking, paying,
pay in hand and fist for this
ride. But in the interim,

927
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:58,120
some guy steps over to me to guy that
was on the plane with me and says, Hey,

928
00:51:58,121 --> 00:52:02,790
yeah, you're doing, what are
you guys doing? What are you
going and like? I'm like,

929
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:06,070
I'm like, what you hear on vacation
two and we're talking back and forth.

930
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,610
I'm going to see this buddy of
mine. Yeah, Diaz. He's done.

931
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,560
He's a bodega owner in new East, New
York. And the guy like, Oh really?

932
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,450
Where's this? Where's he
live? I go, I don't know,

933
00:52:13,451 --> 00:52:17,560
someplace in a lower amount or
whatever. I said, turns out if the DEA,

934
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,940
they fucking followed me on the plane.
How would you,

935
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,900
how did you not automatically assume that?
Because as soon as you said,

936
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,330
I'm talking to this
sort of my guess,

937
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:31,870
that's what the problem is.
I'm looking at it.

938
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,090
20 2027 28 yeah.
Well,

939
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,310
well I'm 48 I was 28 I probably
would have told him everything.

940
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,390
So I'm on vacation and they
don't have a good time, you know,

941
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:47,390
and I'm just looking for like
a friendly face, you know,

942
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:50,540
and he speaks to a mannequin and don't
worry, I'll take care of you. He says,

943
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,200
I'll get you where you got to go. I
said, great. So [inaudible] guy says,

944
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:58,250
I'll get you where you want to know.
It's fucking DEA. Oh fuck. So anyway,

945
00:52:58,251 --> 00:52:59,700
we ended up in call,
we get with this,

946
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,800
we get all the way to this girl
Cassidy camp. I took it back,

947
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,300
I think it took three different ways to
get there. Should we finally get there?

948
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,390
And they put us in his house
with four different couples.

949
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:12,970
What like was sharing a fucking house,
but somebody, okay, no one's there.

950
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:16,150
Who are these other people?
I don't know them. Okay.

951
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:18,760
I want to love as retreat for the weekend.

952
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,760
And they got me in a house like for people
that want to go camping and hang out

953
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:25,470
together and sweat something.
I don't know. So I look around,

954
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:30,090
I got this for the couples in this
fucking house. Like I'm sharing a kitchen,

955
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:32,250
I'm sharing this. I'm like,
I'm not here for this.

956
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,930
So they drive us back to a, I
said, no, get me out of here.

957
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:39,780
So now they drive us back to this
little retreat right by the beach,

958
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,740
getting there. Everything's
good. Have a nice time. And uh,

959
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,010
I'm calling Adam every night. I mean
your country, Bro. I fucking like.

960
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:51,120
Do you see how I'm here, Joe? I'm in La,
right? I live in Long Island. I'm here.

961
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:56,130
I don't fuck around. I'm
coming. I'm coming. Right? So
I tell Diaz I'm here. He goes,

962
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,950
his wife, we won't answer the phone.
His wife says he's playing basketball.

963
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,790
Now if you show it the, as in the
film, he's five foot three. I don't,

964
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:03,780
maybe he showed it in five
foot three but he, she cute.

965
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:08,190
He's five foot three and cute. So
I'm okay. That's 10 30 at night.

966
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:12,780
Prince is really good at
basketball. What's it uses? Charlie?

967
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,230
Charlie Murphy talked about it. What
are you guys playing? Basketball.

968
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,320
So I'm calling him every day and every
night. Now I'm a little annoyed. I mean,

969
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:23,480
your country, I'm here. Don't show
respect. Show up. Right, right.

970
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,120
Plus the fact that you will be fucking
like $14,000 right now I'm getting a

971
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:31,020
little nervous, maybe three
weeks, four weeks pay.

972
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,470
And I'm told about myself, you
know, so I'm a little annoyed,

973
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,640
but I'm spending $1,000 $1,500
come see you for a reason.

974
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,310
Actually 4,000 by the time I figured
the trip out, man. Fucking, anyway, so

975
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:45,860
he's playing basketball. It's midnight.
I call this fucking house now.

976
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,730
Mad midnight in brewing
in this fucking phone.

977
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,030
His wife answers the phone at midnight.
Mike, he's playing basketball. I said,

978
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:54,690
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
It's midnight. He's five foot three.

979
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,570
How much basketball could he possibly be
playing? I mean, it's country. I said,

980
00:54:57,571 --> 00:54:59,400
this is not to disrespectful.
Tell him I said that.

981
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,180
I don't know if you can have somebody
hit me. Kill me. I don't fucking know.

982
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:06,000
I'm pissed. I don't know at this
point. Who Cares? Right. Anyway,

983
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,070
we turned around and we leave. We get
nothing. We get ready to get on a plane.

984
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:13,140
About an hour before the plane.
I'm staying in a hotel and in a sense,

985
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:17,120
the center of Santa Domingo
and as a casino downstairs, um,

986
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,100
I left the fucking gamble eight Atlantic
city. Every time we hit a big load,

987
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:23,730
we hit Atlantic city. So I'm in the
casino. The Lights go out in the casino.

988
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:27,530
I got like 20 minutes. I put American
money and Dominican and money.

989
00:55:27,531 --> 00:55:31,740
I used American, I hit him for like six
800 lodge right there like 10 minutes.

990
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:34,320
They want to stab me.
They don't want to let me leave.

991
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,410
They tried to hold me Pete there.
I got to catch a fucking plane.

992
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:40,440
Like I know it's a,
it's a 40 minute ride from where I am.

993
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:43,590
So I got to get going now they're
like your kitchen and I go, yeah,

994
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:44,250
let me go that.

995
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,710
They got flashlights on the table
cause the lights go out like every,

996
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,770
every hour or two to go
out for like 15 minutes.

997
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:52,800
The casino's not back then it did.
So he's standing with flashlights,

998
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,260
making sure everybody's money's not
getting stolen or robbed from him.

999
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,660
I can't shout and I leave to get
on a plane and come back home.

1000
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,970
So I get home on the way home.

1001
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,460
I get strip searched in the APP
now if you've gotta be kidding me,

1002
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,710
coming from the Dominican Republic,

1003
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:07,590
there's nothing but packages where
people with ropes and cardboard boxes.

1004
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,750
I got walking like real luggage. You know
these people have stamps on the side.

1005
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:15,670
Yeah. Yo won the fucking side of
their boxes coming in and right.

1006
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,280
Women's have their thighs cut open so
they can stuff packages are fucking coke

1007
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:23,700
in their thighs. Right. But I'm coming in
with a little bag and a little, no. My,

1008
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,730
my little Guinea tee,

1009
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:27,640
whatever fucking wearing and coming from
Dominica and I'm getting strip searched

1010
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:32,170
in the airport. So I'm looking around them
and saying, this is fucking some setup.

1011
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:37,020
Anyway, I, it's a set up right
now, Mike Gout is finally,
you're waking up, you know,

1012
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,180
and I go, what's that fucking
Trump? I didn't know his name.

1013
00:56:40,181 --> 00:56:42,630
I thought it's a track bound. His
name is [inaudible] boldly. I goes,

1014
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,840
that fucking track bomb. I'm, I know
it is. Anyway, get strip searched.

1015
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:51,310
She gets cavity search. I choke up on the
plane. I broke up with her on the plane,

1016
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:53,920
on the plane on the way back because
I was going to, my wife said, okay,

1017
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:58,920
go have fun. Come back. We'll talk. Right.
So on the way back, you're like, yeah,

1018
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:03,040
but you know, I'm going back. I'm
going home or at the wall. Right.

1019
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,300
So, yeah, she's a, she's distraught
now. She's getting bent off.

1020
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:13,210
I just fucked up and now these people
are fucking her. It was horrible.

1021
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,380
I mean that's me laughing because you
know, life is, you know, the horrible,

1022
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:21,770
you know well after the fact,
right. Exactly. So anyway,

1023
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,880
so we get home and whatever
we do at lists, deeds and uh,

1024
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,120
outside the fucking salt. I didn't want
to tell us zone was outside. Fucking it.

1025
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,330
A license plate numbers down.
They'd flashlights on the,

1026
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:32,910
on the inspection stickers for a cause.

1027
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,570
The turtle affairs with outside marked
in the locations and the times and

1028
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:39,250
everything else that,
that I was at the house.

1029
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:43,210
I didn't want to tell him and spook.
Uh, so, uh, anyway, a week goes by,

1030
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:46,570
two weeks go by. Whenever it was
finally a, I met Byron Sharp.

1031
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:50,970
What are sound city with this whole
thing basically centers around and uh,

1032
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:57,370
Adams there and I want to fucking, I
don't know for the bite him, kick him,

1033
00:57:57,371 --> 00:57:59,910
hug him or stab him. I'm fucking,
I want to kill him. Right?

1034
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:04,810
Like what the fuck I was in your country.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1035
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:09,850
He goes, the DEA had your phones
while you were in Dominican Republic.

1036
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,040
He said, they tapped you,
they volunteer. He said,

1037
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:15,040
I was warned by the
Dominican beliefs department,

1038
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,350
the state of fuck away from you.
Wow.

1039
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,320
You think you would've
sent a pigeon or something?

1040
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:22,750
Send me a message while
he probably couldn't,

1041
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,850
probably probably couldn't trust anybody.

1042
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:28,360
It's probably one of those situations
where what can you do if you're,

1043
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,560
if you know that you're being tapped
and you know that they're watching,

1044
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,840
it's probably best to just play
basketball. That's what he was doing,

1045
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:39,790
which you got to do sometimes just
lay low and hope that he sees you.

1046
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,250
That makes sense. Yeah. Well he's a smart
guy. Why did you avoid getting killed?

1047
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:49,990
That's, that's what is most shocking
that you were involved with.

1048
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:55,360
I mean, listen, you go into a ring,
you think he coming out, right? Yeah.

1049
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:58,990
That's it.
So just do realize now,

1050
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:01,330
like we're looking back on
it like Jesus fucking Christ.

1051
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:03,920
Like I came really close.
Well,

1052
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:08,260
the most serious of front that I faced
was that guy cello that you mentioned in

1053
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:09,094
the documentary.

1054
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,010
And why I say that it's not because
at any moment something could have,

1055
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:14,470
could have gone wrong in
any deal, you know? Um,

1056
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,070
cause at some point I began purchasing
the coke from these guys because they

1057
00:59:18,071 --> 00:59:21,230
couldn't constantly front you fucking
kilos cause they loved you and I can only

1058
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:22,190
get by them,
provide

1059
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,040
them protection cause I wasn't,
they took my guns and badger away.

1060
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,950
Actually I should, I should've ended
it. Done. Let's not just keep it real.

1061
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:30,050
I surrendered my gun and badge.
Why don't you surrender it?

1062
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,720
Cause I was trying to get up to job on
a psycho disability, psycho disability,

1063
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:39,320
you know, I mean it makes sense,
right? But they gave me my guns back.

1064
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:42,350
This was what's ruinous. They gave
it to you back. They go, nope,

1065
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,330
we did an investigation. We
decided you're gay. Okay.

1066
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:49,040
And I'm reading the fucking papers.
You don't even know. This is surreal.

1067
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,580
I'm reading this. It see a piece of
paper. I have you on this piece of paper.

1068
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:56,750
There's a guy, he's about 90 years old.
This is no joke, not a bit, not here,

1069
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,440
but there's a 90 year old guy.

1070
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:01,220
He's the head shrink and the
whole new city police department.

1071
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,880
He's got this piece,
this dossier in front of him.

1072
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:07,410
He leaves it out and I'm in there
to get my gun and badge back

1073
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,470
is 90 so he turns around and he's
got to go about 50 feet this way.

1074
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:17,040
Open a locker with a lock on it. I take
my gun in my bag and give it back to me.

1075
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:23,180
So I'm sort of like doing a nick twist
and curl and it says four or five

1076
01:00:24,631 --> 01:00:29,460
separate allegations for selling
narcotics and have a red corvette and this

1077
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:34,410
guy's giving me back my gun and badge.
I'm like, this is fucking unbelievable.

1078
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:38,370
It's the first time I have
a sore officially in writing
what they had me under

1079
01:00:38,371 --> 01:00:38,990
investigation,

1080
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:43,260
well there's 19 different fucking listed
investigations of four specifically at

1081
01:00:43,261 --> 01:00:48,261
one period of time from like 86 87 88
specifically laid out week after week.

1082
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:52,230
What they were looking for me for. I'm
like, and this is from a red corvette.

1083
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,760
So I knew exactly what time that was.

1084
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:57,630
I only had the red corvette for a
short period as well. So I'm like,

1085
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,440
I can't believe they give me my shit
back. I mean, this is, this is now I know.

1086
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,050
I'm scared.
I don't know.

1087
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,660
Do, do you think that
they were giving you ship?

1088
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,590
Actually you could keep doing what you're
doing. They catch you on more shit.

1089
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:14,480
Was that the idea behind it?
They don't ever want to catch you.

1090
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:17,850
Really. They don't ever want to catch
you. They want you to stop at that point.

1091
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,560
It's saying,

1092
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,750
I don't want to catch you because if
they catch you at Fox with the whole

1093
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:24,710
department and then a black guy for
everybody, which is true when it's hot,

1094
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,750
you know, listen, what I did was
not good. We know that. Right?

1095
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:30,410
What you were just talking about
it right now. Do you know that, uh,

1096
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,680
what it was it Tamir rice is that the
kids named the 12 year old kid that got

1097
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:37,980
shot, they uh, they decided that
it was okay that there was no,

1098
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,470
nothing wrong that didn't
investigation show.

1099
01:01:40,471 --> 01:01:42,050
There's nothing wrong with
the way the officer acted.

1100
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:46,160
Got Out of his carbon and two seconds
shot this 12 year old kid who had a gun,

1101
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,360
fake gun,
toy gun.

1102
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:53,700
Joe. A lot of these things
that you mentioned, I don't
know all the facts on a,

1103
01:01:53,701 --> 01:01:58,320
I'm not here to bash what cops do cause
what they do as an impossible job, right.

1104
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,430
The problem is that everybody
makes mistakes and when
you're a cop and you make

1105
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:06,840
a mistake can cost somebody their life
and that's, that's the reality. You know,

1106
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:11,220
and you know, if you ask me is it
other solutions and other alternatives,

1107
01:02:11,221 --> 01:02:14,010
I say absolutely. Uh,
you know, give a cop, uh,

1108
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,430
the body cameras give them more body
cameras. Why not? I mean, you know,

1109
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,500
everyone else is filming. You might
as well be the filming it. Yeah.

1110
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,810
Problem was this story. Totally unrelated
story, but this story was on camera.

1111
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:29,250
[inaudible] I, you know, I caught a
little glimpse of some stuff, Joe.

1112
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:32,010
I try not to pass judgment
because I'm not the one there.

1113
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:36,390
I've been in a hundreds. Listen, in East
New York, I pulled my gun out every day.

1114
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,040
I probably pull my gun out 15 times
a day and I never shot anybody.

1115
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,270
So you pulled your gun out
to Warren people. You pull
you to let them know that,

1116
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,940
let them know that this
is serious and that, uh,

1117
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:50,520
I need to know where your hands
are right now. Right now. Right.

1118
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:51,960
Your hands on my threat.
Right.

1119
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,170
And if I don't see your hands and you
don't comply with me with your hands,

1120
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:58,170
then I may have to kill. You
may have to. I don't want to,

1121
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:01,940
but I'm letting you know. It's
amazing. You never shot anybody. Yeah.

1122
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,420
Clothes cut for cars.

1123
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:06,980
I actually shot a cop ones really
undercover on the cover cheese.

1124
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,990
It was beating up some kids,

1125
01:03:07,991 --> 01:03:11,550
some he had a gun on a kid and
I told him to drop his gun.

1126
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,320
He wouldn't drop his gun.
I was with Kenny that time.

1127
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:15,240
He could probably tell the story as
well because he remembers everything

1128
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:19,680
perfectly. Um, but he talked to
that guy anymore. Kenny? Not really.

1129
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,830
They're not, but we don't have a good
relationship, let's put it that way.

1130
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:25,880
I would imagine that would be a strain
on the friendship when a guy puts your

1131
01:03:25,881 --> 01:03:28,680
way to 12 years.
It's not even that anymore.

1132
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:32,250
It's more the way he's handled
things since then. He's just, listen,

1133
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,530
I don't begrudge him for
what happened to his life.

1134
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:37,530
He made decisions in his life based on
more than just his own freedom. Okay.

1135
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:41,980
His wife's freedom was at stake
as well. Okay. Has Children's, uh,

1136
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:46,430
being put into a foster home possibility
was there because you know, right.

1137
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:50,640
I understand that I, dory was directly
involved in certain things. His wife,

1138
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:55,560
you two together on a podcast would be
fucking epic. What we tried to audience,

1139
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:57,980
we couldn't do it together.
Did you know we worked on all these,

1140
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:58,920
we wouldn't sit in the same room.

1141
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:02,550
I listen because I really don't want to
give him the credibility that he does

1142
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:04,650
not deserve because he continually,

1143
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,780
we have were at odds over certain things
and aspects of the story in certain

1144
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:14,350
aspects of the story. And, uh, when I
confront him and he just tells me, well,

1145
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,070
you're a liar. You know, what
do I have to lie about it?

1146
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,180
What do I have to fucking
lie about? Right? I'm the
guy who did the fucking time.

1147
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:23,940
I have nothing to lie about. If you'll
remember things differently than I,

1148
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:27,730
that's fine, you know? But
the reality is, uh, you know,

1149
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,000
I'm just going to touch on it briefly.

1150
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:35,730
This kidnapping slash murder slash
whatever execution slave functioned at the

1151
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:39,510
end. We weren't going to the
woman's house to do that. Okay?

1152
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,120
You weren't going to the woman's
House to survey her house.

1153
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:45,810
He insisted that we welcome
to the front door. I said,

1154
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:47,610
what are you out of your fucking mind?
That's not even in the plan.

1155
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,710
That doesn't make the tapes. That's
what I've been in the plant, Kenny.

1156
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,980
Yeah. Well, I'm not driving all the way
here and not going up to the front door.

1157
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,133
First of all,

1158
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,300
that shouldn't even be a
discussion because we're not
going to have to the front

1159
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:02,710
door. This other people involved in
this. They're going to go in and tell me,

1160
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:06,960
get you on recording saying they
had to get rid of this woman.

1161
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:12,450
He said to quit. You don't, here
is what he's saying for 20 minutes,

1162
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:15,210
30 minutes saying they're going to
execute them. Like you don't look at me.

1163
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,010
I'm like, who? Who's going to execute
it? The Colombians. He keeps saying,

1164
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,610
right. First of all, where
are the Colombians? Second.

1165
01:05:20,611 --> 01:05:23,170
Well they're not here and third of all,
whatever we throw,

1166
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:26,490
whatever I want to get past the
compensation. Right. Cause I've,

1167
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:30,260
since he's fucking taping
it, quite sensitive to, to,

1168
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,890
I've asked him numerous times,
Kenny, you wearing a wire? Come on.

1169
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,500
Just tell me the truth.
So who this before he was wearing a wire,

1170
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:37,640
you thought he was wearing a wire?
No, while he was wearing a watch.

1171
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:42,340
So you knew when shit was going down. That
wasn't making sense. So I kept saying,

1172
01:05:42,341 --> 01:05:45,010
I'm be wearing a wire. No, no Mike, I've
been able to do that to you. I'm like,

1173
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,350
I want to believe this guy. You
know, I want to believe him.

1174
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,590
Should one of those things
like remembering those
old stupid TV shows where

1175
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,140
you'd have to say you'd ask a cop,
are you a cop?

1176
01:05:53,141 --> 01:05:54,940
And then they would have to tell you.

1177
01:05:56,330 --> 01:06:01,330
Remember that what people fucking
believe that which is God damn hilarious.

1178
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:05,700
You know if a cop, if you just ask him if
he's a cop, they got to tell you. Yeah,

1179
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:09,490
right. Good luck. Fucking fantasy land
that you're living in luck with that one.

1180
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,010
That's,
that's God damn.

1181
01:06:11,011 --> 01:06:14,530
Alexia cop is allowed to do a bump
if he has to stay alive. Well,

1182
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:17,260
there are allowed in Hawaii to
fuck prostitutes. Well that's good.

1183
01:06:17,261 --> 01:06:21,910
I'm on a job there. Did
you hear that? That's true.

1184
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:22,750
It's a recent thing.

1185
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:27,751
They made a recent decision that police
officer's in a y or allowed to have sex

1186
01:06:28,241 --> 01:06:31,840
with prostitutes on the job as a
part of an ongoing investigation let,

1187
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:34,360
because they can't get enough on
their own. I mean come on. Well,

1188
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:38,350
because they have to find out
things and the yes, I understand.

1189
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,950
Let's say fuck,
you got to fuck me and then we can talk.

1190
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:45,440
We'll probably work intimacy.
Like I said, let's go there.

1191
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:48,280
Your own private detective agency.

1192
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:52,300
Well undercover women wind up fucking drug
dealers and stuff all the time. Right.

1193
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:55,630
It's a dark secret, isn't
it? Release. It isn't moving.

1194
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:57,890
Well they could've gotten me pretty
easily that way then couldn't they?

1195
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:01,190
Why didn't they do that? Yeah,
why don't we send Kenny and

1196
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:04,923
good and I

1197
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:09,100
just that,

1198
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:12,670
that build the neighborhood I would have
done just sending one of those little,

1199
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,240
you know, dime packages and we'll
the tape recorders back then though.

1200
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,350
We're fucking giant monsters
VCR looking things man.

1201
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,210
And I didn't check them because
I, it was too, I was too proud.

1202
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,210
Like you wouldn't do that to
me. And my brother says to
me, Mike, did you toss him?

1203
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:29,050
I go, yeah, I didn't. Wow.

1204
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,540
And thank God I didn't that
day cause I well thank God.

1205
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,390
I mean what's the difference? I see I
was going to do with my time either way,

1206
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:38,710
but what if he had killed him or something
or what if you would've been messy.

1207
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:42,430
Thank God. None of us think I didn't find
out. Yeah, anything could have happened.

1208
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:42,930
I don't know.

1209
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:46,870
It would have been an assault and
violence and brought another level to

1210
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:47,471
something else.

1211
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:50,500
And you had threatened to witness how
the fuck that I know he was a witness

1212
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:54,850
still a minute ago. Right? Exactly.
That's the sneaky thing about it.

1213
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,060
Now you went away for 12 years.
I'm sentenced to 14 years.

1214
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:03,310
I took a plea agreement that was 10
to life. Okay. That's the [inaudible].

1215
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,000
That was the play.

1216
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And so how does it fall like they offered
me 24 to 30 that was my first offer.

1217
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:11,930
I call my lawyer. What the fuck
did I kill somebody? He goes, well,

1218
01:08:11,931 --> 01:08:14,050
I'm not just the way the federal
government, as I said, that's nice.

1219
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,340
So 12 to 12 to 24

1220
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:20,060
to 30 was my first offer. Now,
what pisses me off is here's a guy,

1221
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,570
he doesn't realize what he's dead just
dead to a guy who he was eating my house,

1222
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,051
Debbie,
you know,

1223
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:27,860
a couple of weeks ago and now he doesn't
realize that instead of just doing our

1224
01:08:27,861 --> 01:08:30,260
time together, like
just take the w, let me,

1225
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:33,860
let me backtrack a little bit and we'll
try to remember that where we were. Okay.

1226
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:35,120
When we were out on bail,

1227
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:40,100
Kenny handsome options as I did to either
cooperate with the government and give

1228
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:42,670
everything up and just go on and do
your memory a little bit in your life,

1229
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,960
whatever it might amount
to have been too little.

1230
01:08:44,961 --> 01:08:48,980
It might've been more so I
get off on a shrimp boat trip,

1231
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:53,540
a job in Nicaragua to run shrimp shrimp.
They often,

1232
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:58,700
who the fuck is offering your shirt,
the owner of the story of hotel,

1233
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:04,130
not story of manner. In in a
story queens, he's got a k,

1234
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,290
a catering hall with a bunch of
weddings and most weddings they loved,

1235
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:10,490
they had shrimp and every wedding, here's
11 rooms in the, in the catering wall.

1236
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:15,050
So he's got 11 people, sometimes twice
a day filtering shrimps or was business.

1237
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:18,530
So he says like, Mike, you're going
away for a long period of time. He said,

1238
01:09:18,531 --> 01:09:21,440
so I got an option for you. I need
a shrimp boat, Captain Nicaragua,

1239
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:25,340
you want to go? I went, oh man.
So you know, I'm looking for any,

1240
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:29,870
anything to grab onto at that point in
my life. And I go home and I'm like,

1241
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:33,210
I give Kenny a call. I said, Kenny,
listen, I want to talk to you Mike.

1242
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:36,530
I don't know if we should talk as Ken,
let's meet and talk.

1243
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:40,070
So we have a conversation and
he says, Mike, I got a pension.

1244
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,740
I've got a wife and a kid. He says, I'm
not giving that shit up. And you go, shit,

1245
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:46,700
if I ever have to, if I have to do a
little bit, I have to do it fine. I says,

1246
01:09:46,701 --> 01:09:49,880
but I'm not giving it all to a shrimp
boat fishing in Nicaragua. I said, okay.

1247
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:53,620
Done story done. Case closed,
done. Never happened. Okay.

1248
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,100
Three, four days later, maybe less,
two days later, the phone rings. Mike,

1249
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,530
I'm interested in gold fishing.
Nobody talking about fishing.

1250
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:05,570
So he comes to see me. He says, ah,
now I see the fucking DEA over here.

1251
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,380
I see something over here. I see
everybody. I'm, I'm being followed. I go,

1252
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:12,190
what are you talking about?
He goes, I want to go fishing.

1253
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,030
Remember the fishing trip
you're talking about last week?

1254
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:17,690
I know what fishing trip. Fucking, you
know the Marlin fishing trip. What?

1255
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:22,580
Fishing trip. He won't say the
word shrimp boat in Nicaragua.

1256
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:27,590
Why? Wow. It's has to come from me.
Why does it have to come from me?

1257
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:30,590
Because it, if you're working
for the government at this point,

1258
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:35,030
you can't be the one that interacts the
person. It has to come out of my mouth.

1259
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:39,470
So him saying, let's go fishing
trip. Let's go fishing. Yeah. Right.

1260
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:42,740
So he wants you to see, cause he wants
you to say, I'm going to skip the country.

1261
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:45,050
Correct.
He wants me to say,

1262
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:50,120
you mean like I do the shrimp
boat job in Nicaragua, right? Yes.

1263
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,980
She jumps up out of his fucking chair.

1264
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,500
I'm like looking at what the fuck are
you so excited about and now I know

1265
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:58,370
something's wrong. So
yeah, he's ridiculous.

1266
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,570
So now I go, okay, something's not right.

1267
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:05,880
And I started finding the fucking set
up everywhere around me and he's opening

1268
01:11:05,881 --> 01:11:08,600
the window in his car, his
perfectly quaffed. I said, Kenny,

1269
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,600
what do you open the window for?
The fucking air conditioner is on.

1270
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:14,820
It's 95 degrees out. You here's
gonna get missed. Oh No, no. Anyway,

1271
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:18,300
he disputes. He disputes that. And why
would you dispute that? Anyway, so,

1272
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:24,900
so now
think of what just happened.

1273
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,520
He's now come back to me and says he wants
to go on the shrimp boat trip, right?

1274
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,940
He goes home, I go home. I
said, listen, it's a good idea.

1275
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,500
We need a half a million plus cause
I can't leave. My family broke.

1276
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,990
Only houses are a foot and bail.

1277
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,080
Two days go by and some Colombian
close me up and says, I got,

1278
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,520
I need a half a million dollars.
It is a,

1279
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:46,470
I need a half a million dollars recovered
and 10 kilos from this woman's house

1280
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:50,810
in Jamaica. [inaudible] a claim number.
Just what I need, exactly what I need it.

1281
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:54,040
Right. So, uh, suspicious. Yeah,

1282
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:59,310
I'm a little suspicious,
but I can't believe God is
good. I'm saying he's great.

1283
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:03,870
Look what he's doing. Something really
believed it. They played it off well. So,

1284
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,590
and I'm looking for anything.
I don't know. I'm desperate.
Are you doing coconut?

1285
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:11,220
No. No, no. Six weeks
clean while I was in jail.

1286
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,190
So I was out on bail and no
one would sell anything to me.

1287
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:17,250
I tried to pick up a package to my
own dealer, wouldn't sell it to me.

1288
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:22,860
So that's when times are tough.
And the road on Coke dealer, my own

1289
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,190
mine.
I'm not going to go to Yale.

1290
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,433
I'm not going to yell.

1291
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,840
So I ended up in the discussion with him
and a distinct presents itself and um,

1292
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,130
he's all over it now. Yeah. I want
to go home like [inaudible] Kenny,

1293
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:44,730
you didn't want to go before he says,
yeah, but now I want to go like,

1294
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:48,990
he's like fucking screaming it. I'm like,
okay. You know, it sounds a little odd.

1295
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:53,550
Do you remember why or no? Okay.
Just checking. Just checking.

1296
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:54,931
Anyway,

1297
01:12:54,931 --> 01:12:59,100
so on and on and on we went and eventually
the sting was sad and this thing

1298
01:12:59,101 --> 01:13:03,690
turned into what it turned into. And
uh, you know, it is what it is. Well,

1299
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:07,920
you dispute it in the film.
You say that you, yeah,

1300
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:12,090
but I dispute the premise of the beginning
of the whole process. What the woman,

1301
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:15,330
there's a controversy back and forth.
I never saw her, never met her,

1302
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,640
never intended to touch
it myself personally.

1303
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,590
Ever now how she was gonna get in
my car and gagged and whatever.

1304
01:13:22,591 --> 01:13:24,210
I don't fucking know.
Okay.

1305
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:27,870
But the fact is that we were
supposed to do anything to her.

1306
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:32,610
So for people listening to this that
haven't seen the documentary there was,

1307
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:38,280
it was sort of like a last thing that
you guys could do to make a shit load of

1308
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:43,281
money and it involved kidnapping a
woman who would eventually be murdered.

1309
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,120
Well, this is in the film,
right? It's horrible. Yeah,

1310
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:48,590
but the only his offense,

1311
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:52,740
she was nothing that I never had
anything to do with the eventuals.

1312
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:55,380
I never knew them. He knew
right, and they spoke Spanish.

1313
01:13:55,381 --> 01:13:58,170
I don't fuck with Getty know what
they was saying. Right. I don't know.

1314
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,310
Maybe the government translated
for him, but what part, if any,

1315
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:06,360
were you playing in or anticipate it's
going to take the money from a woman's

1316
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:08,340
house? Come on. You could
do that in your sleep.

1317
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,250
Take the money from a woman's house
and the drugs and go home. Give,

1318
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,040
split it up with the,

1319
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,250
with the Colombians and
God somehow along the way,

1320
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:18,940
whether it be the government fishing,
Kenny fishing, someone pushing.

1321
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:23,330
This woman was going to go
from being money that wasn't
hers. It was a drug deal.

1322
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:27,190
Money that was killed. Her husband
was Dominican drug dealer who was,

1323
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:29,890
who was killed by whom? I, I
can't answer that question,

1324
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:33,610
but the fact is that he had a half a
million in cash and that home according to

1325
01:14:33,611 --> 01:14:37,540
the set up people and 10 kilos and we
can take it off and split it down the

1326
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:40,330
middle and you'll have your money.
You can leave the country. I mean,

1327
01:14:40,331 --> 01:14:44,380
very convenient. Very. Yeah,
very nice. All I was like,

1328
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:48,190
wow. What a crazy scenario though. So,

1329
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:52,210
and that trope in front of shaking down
street drug dealers for a couple of

1330
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:55,560
hundred a day to a, you
know, but see that's us.

1331
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,940
That's like an attempted murder.

1332
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:02,050
That's a whole conspiracy trying to get
me a new charge. No, no, no, I'm not.

1333
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:04,420
But I'm saying like they obviously
couldn't pin that on you,

1334
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,730
otherwise you would've went away
for a lot longer than 12 years.

1335
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,980
So you answered that. You
answered the question. So,

1336
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:12,850
but it seems like that was something
they were trying to concoct to make

1337
01:15:12,851 --> 01:15:15,280
everything a lot more
severe. Correct. Okay.

1338
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,950
Now when you go where you went,

1339
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:21,250
but think about how many years
you were involved in actual crime.

1340
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:26,700
How many years do you think you were
involved as a cop committing crime? Well,

1341
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:28,780
every time you put the uniform on
and you don't do the right thing,

1342
01:15:28,781 --> 01:15:30,850
you'd pretty much be committed a
crime. Right. And you have gone yet.

1343
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:35,050
So how many years was that about? I'd
say a solid five. A solid five years.

1344
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:39,420
So not that bad to go
away for 12 for a song.

1345
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:43,270
You want to minimize my sentence
now? I mean every nasal,
no fucking day. I'm sure.

1346
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:47,020
But I was going to bring that up too.
But what is it like when you go in there?

1347
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:51,010
I mean first of all, you're a cop. They
know you're a cop. Everywhere I went,

1348
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:51,971
they know what is,

1349
01:15:51,971 --> 01:15:54,280
that was the first person they do on
the compounded when I hit the compound.

1350
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:59,200
And what is that?
It's like having 1800 men times too,

1351
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:01,390
because they each got to wise,
most of them not, not all.

1352
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:06,070
So you have 3,600 eyes on you. Never
mind the 600 staff in there watching you.

1353
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:10,920
24 seven watch new threatening you.
You know,

1354
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:13,870
you I both someone that could be a threat,
right? Even if you're in a fight game,

1355
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:18,010
ice can mean either compliance,
you know, or fuck you.

1356
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:20,560
And then then it's up to you.
How do you want to handle this date?

1357
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,760
Did they think of you as almost one of
them because you were also involved in

1358
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:28,270
crime and there was a
strange relationship.

1359
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:33,610
Many of them wish that they
were me because they would
love to have that power.

1360
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:37,480
I mean, right? Dozens if not hundreds of
said, man, I wish I was a fucking cop.

1361
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:40,240
All right.
I think it really

1362
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,050
well if you see in the film it
felt like he would, it just,

1363
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,540
you could do anything you wanted.
It was horrible.

1364
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,890
But that's what was my point
about having that kind of power.

1365
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,740
But in prison you have none,
right? You're the least one.

1366
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:58,420
They want you and the child analysis,
you know,

1367
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:02,590
that's so is that how they lump you in
the right in the same category? Wow.

1368
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:06,820
So basically when they say a the yard by
myself for 12, other than Mickey Monday,

1369
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:10,160
who came up to me and said hello
to me. It was Mickey Monday. I

1370
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,670
use that blonde hair guy from the
cocaine cowboys. You ever seen it?

1371
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:14,810
Fuck yeah. Yeah. He's my buddy.

1372
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:18,680
That's my friend Billy carbons
documentary, both of them.

1373
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:21,800
Cocaine cowboys one and two.
That guys, your buddy? Yeah,
he went to jail with him.

1374
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:26,801
I got a picture on the two of you together
was fucking great stories last week

1375
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,190
and my ass crimes in Miami
and his favorite book and
a greasy spoon spot down.

1376
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,410
Oh, he's out to, yeah. Beautiful.

1377
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:37,660
Yeah. I was sitting there with
this guy, John Cod Dillo, uh,

1378
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,520
who does a radio show on
Iheart radio down there, uh,

1379
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:43,210
at of Fort Lauderdale a him and he and I,

1380
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:47,470
he's a retired cop and he's a
great host on a show. And uh,

1381
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:51,090
but talking about maybe doing something
together too as well, and the good cop,

1382
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,380
bad cop show, that sounds like a
great idea, but you fucking piss all.

1383
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:58,170
If you don't have a podcast, there's a
fucking crime being committed right now.

1384
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,410
You should ask fucking easiest shit.

1385
01:18:01,411 --> 01:18:05,160
Jamie will tell you it's easier.
No, Gigi, he's sweating over there.

1386
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:08,130
This is a way more complex
setup than anybody really needs.

1387
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:10,920
I mean we only do it this way because
it's kind of fun to have video of it.

1388
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,570
Live streaming, right? Yeah. We're live
right now. Yeah. How's my hair look great.

1389
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,113
It's easy.

1390
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:23,900
I wish I'd done this when I was 20 but
the point is like all you need is a

1391
01:18:24,331 --> 01:18:25,550
little MP record.

1392
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,850
If we had a little recorder that's like
the size of a cell phone like this,

1393
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:33,780
like I can each of the size of Kenyon.
Well No,

1394
01:18:33,781 --> 01:18:36,660
if he wishes yet something
this small back then, but uh,

1395
01:18:36,661 --> 01:18:38,850
I've done a few of them
just with my iPhone.

1396
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,450
We just set it down on a table and the
microphones and these things are really

1397
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,760
good. Yeah, you could do
it and then you upload it.

1398
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:46,730
It doesn't mean it's fucking easy shit,

1399
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:50,950
but I need someone like you to feed off
of. I'm not the ghetto ghetto. Like,

1400
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:55,000
you just find somebody, you
just fine. I'm telling you,

1401
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,600
one of the guys that I shook
down, you could do that. He's

1402
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:59,090
funny story. I'm at, I'm at the, uh,

1403
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:02,420
one of the premiers and I did
a lot of a great idea actually.

1404
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,730
I am had a premiere and I see these guys
come walking up and they looked fucking,

1405
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,450
they look a little
haggard, you know, and uh,

1406
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:13,520
they looking at me with that
like cheapest, like look
and like, you know, I'm,

1407
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,220
I'm like semi star the thing.

1408
01:19:15,221 --> 01:19:17,560
So I got to look all proper and
everything and looking, you know,

1409
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:21,820
will ever date that.
And up comes these guys,

1410
01:19:21,821 --> 01:19:23,680
it looked like they from
the street, you know? Right.

1411
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,270
So they got their hats on sideways.

1412
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:28,180
Half their teeth are missing and the guy
sticks his hand out and he goes, Mike,

1413
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:33,120
I go, yeah. He goes, I used to
hang out on picket and fucking,

1414
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:37,230
uh, picking and um, [inaudible] not north,

1415
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,460
cause no one does it meet it, but picking
and pressing and picking and chestnut.

1416
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,040
And I'm like, okay. He goes,
yeah, you used to shake me
down. I'm like, Oh really?

1417
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:46,243
He goes,

1418
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:50,350
but we both made it like it was like
almost a fucking initial bond that you

1419
01:19:50,351 --> 01:19:54,880
could, you couldn't imagine like
I did my bed whenever he did.

1420
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:55,690
You know,

1421
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,320
30 fucking years later he's shaking my
hand like that at a movie premiere thing.

1422
01:19:59,321 --> 01:20:03,060
It was just saying, he was like, well,
the pouty, I don't know if that's like,

1423
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:05,860
that makes sense. Wow. Go
of, you'll live through it.

1424
01:20:05,861 --> 01:20:08,130
We look at us and like only like 10

1425
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,300
people live through it now.
Right.

1426
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:12,450
Those three of those three and
me and a couple other people.

1427
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:17,170
So in a sense where you both
survivors in a sense, no respect.

1428
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:20,490
There was respect. It was nice to see.
That's bizarre. Right? And tell you,

1429
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:22,440
a couple of cop came up to me,
they really didn't like it,

1430
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,740
but they didn't like that. But they
came up and hugged me and said, hey man,

1431
01:20:25,741 --> 01:20:29,550
you made it, you know, go on with
your life, but you really, to me, you,

1432
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,710
I'd have to be honest with you. You
know, you're still a company, you're hot.

1433
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,840
You know, they were fighting. You were
a fighter in your heart, you know,

1434
01:20:33,841 --> 01:20:35,850
you know that, you know, it's respect.

1435
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:40,610
That's a strained relationship
between you and the other cop.

1436
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,280
But you give up your whole community.
Yeah.

1437
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,730
You know when you fuck you fuck up
like I did, you gave it, you know,

1438
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:48,750
and my whole family is involved in it
and you know what the police department,

1439
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:51,780
fire department to your destroyed your
relationship with that whole community

1440
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:55,410
and that's how you grew up. So I
basically destroyed every fabric of my,

1441
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:57,060
of Hawaii. I am, you know,

1442
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:01,110
but then again they have to watch that
documentary be fucking entertained.

1443
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:05,400
They loved it. I taught people come to
me, you don't listen. It was back then.

1444
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:09,060
So now they know and they know who I am
as a human being and really mean good.

1445
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,740
I don't always do good. But I
do mean well. Right. Well like,

1446
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,491
like I said,

1447
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:19,260
if I was 23 years old and I was living
when you were living and doing that job,

1448
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,580
I probably would have been right
there with you. I probably would have,

1449
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:27,120
yo Yo one in a thousand of said the same
exact words. So this is some comfort.

1450
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,540
Maybe it is, there's some comfort.
I, you know, there's this, um,

1451
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:34,620
I used to have this different look about
people I should say. Well, you know,

1452
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:38,300
you're responsible for your own actions,
which in a sense you absolutely are.

1453
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:43,580
But there's also this concept that all
of your own actions and whoever you are

1454
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:47,880
in a lot of ways are
determined by your environment,

1455
01:21:47,881 --> 01:21:51,720
by how you grew up,
by what situation you find yourself in,

1456
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:56,520
by the circumstances you find yourself
in that situation. Yeah. And there's,

1457
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,030
there's a lot going on.
And then there's the fun.

1458
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:04,400
There was a lot that's a fucking
problem. Say I have to say, you know, I,

1459
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,150
but I was watching that documentary.
I was like,

1460
01:22:06,151 --> 01:22:08,160
this guy looks like he's
having a great fucking time.

1461
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,440
I don't know if that's a good thing.
It's not a good thing.

1462
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:13,740
It's not a good thing what I
did. But here's the thing, right?

1463
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,080
One of the things you alluded to,

1464
01:22:16,081 --> 01:22:18,960
so like who's bringing the
fucking drugs into that community?

1465
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:21,300
You know who's bringing
the drugs into the country,

1466
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:24,670
and I hate to go all
crazy conspiracy theory,

1467
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:29,360
but the reality is there
were a bunch of rogue CIA,

1468
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,290
CIA agents.
We're bringing it in bunch of rogue Agios,

1469
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,910
Olly norths crew fucking
demeanor airport at a,

1470
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:39,630
my mom can show dark listens
family that was involved.

1471
01:22:39,631 --> 01:22:42,810
I was in jail with his cousin. Yeah.
What was the guy that got killed?

1472
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,820
The bearings seals.
Barry Seal's,

1473
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:48,330
who was the pilot because
all these photographs of
him with all these Colombian

1474
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:50,790
drug lords and and this guy,
he went,

1475
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,550
he was murdered on his way to testify.

1476
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:57,540
He had George buses phone number in
his fucking pocket when he was killed.

1477
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,860
This is, this is, there's a lot of
fucking shit going on with this.

1478
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:06,190
There's so much money involved in
drugs. That's why I don't I, I'm for

1479
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:11,230
total legalization and decriminalization
of all narcotics. Everything.

1480
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:16,330
Because you make criminal how the
people that generally not criminals.

1481
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:20,680
Yes. It was just a lot of money in it.
I mean, yeah. The guy goes to a school,

1482
01:23:20,681 --> 01:23:21,720
becomes a stockbroker.

1483
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:25,210
He finds out that the bill money isn't
being criminal criminal instead of making

1484
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:27,970
his 60 70 or a hundred thousand
and you must make 66 million.

1485
01:23:27,971 --> 01:23:31,090
So he has to be a criminal. So, and
that, that's choice you made though.

1486
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,411
He made that choice.

1487
01:23:32,411 --> 01:23:37,300
But being exposed to the
opportunity people find out
who they really can become.

1488
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:40,300
Yes. Or we, we, you know,

1489
01:23:40,301 --> 01:23:42,700
I like to say you're not what you've done.

1490
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,710
It's what you've become afterwards though.

1491
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,480
Like someone hurt somebody,
you know,

1492
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:53,550
in a moment of rage or something
or inadvertently does something.

1493
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:57,130
Or will they go out of their way to
do something because for whatever the

1494
01:23:57,131 --> 01:24:01,810
driving reasons are. So they're forever
defined by that act. Yes. But that,

1495
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:03,790
that's not necessarily who someone is.

1496
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:07,800
People love to forever define people
by that act because they, they,

1497
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:12,310
they in some way are very
happy. It's not them. Right.

1498
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:16,600
And so they want to say you pieces,
you're a piece of shit forever. Forever.

1499
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:20,350
But how many people did what I did got
away with it and throwing fucking stones

1500
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:22,300
at me a lot. Okay. I'm sure.

1501
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,780
Let's go back into the histories
in the list from between,

1502
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:31,000
let's go a 85 to 95 every single,

1503
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,780
call it ghetto precinct cause that's
what it's called in the police world.

1504
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,830
Every single ghetto precinct had a scandal
very similar to mine except maybe not

1505
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:39,664
to the,

1506
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:44,690
the depth like you had initially said
when I really got into the paying straight

1507
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:48,160
out dealing with the guys, let's
be honest, you're an all star.

1508
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:52,050
You were an all star in the
world of corruption. That's
what it's like. It's like,

1509
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,420
you know, there's a pretty shot to take
it to the next level. It's quite, I mean,

1510
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:58,180
not everybody can be Ronda Rousey,
you know what I'm saying? You know,

1511
01:24:58,190 --> 01:24:59,520
not got everybody with Joe Jones,

1512
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:03,090
he's had her last guy on TV
to the next level and you,

1513
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,660
you took it to the next
level in the world.

1514
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:08,200
I must say my mother and my
children are quite proud of that.

1515
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:13,030
But you know what I'm saying? I mean,
whenever you have any sort of an act,

1516
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:16,540
whether it's a guy who's,
uh, a marijuana dealer,

1517
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:18,520
a guy who's a fucking bow hunter,

1518
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,160
you're going to have people that
just take it to the ultimate,

1519
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:25,120
they take it to the furthest extreme and
that's what you did as a corrupt cop.

1520
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:27,980
I just found ways to continue to get it.

1521
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,360
When you say better,
the guy like Serpico,

1522
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,990
like you think he's a piece of shit
or you think he's a man? I mean,

1523
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:37,760
I have nothing personal against, no. You
understand what I'm hang out with him, uh,

1524
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:42,220
you know, for any period of time. But
you kind of dabbled in that when you,

1525
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:45,530
when I turned it on and the guy
with the gunshot, right, right.

1526
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,690
And quickly went back to being a criminal,

1527
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:53,560
but it paid better until, uh, it was
lot more fun now when you go away.

1528
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:57,940
Okay. And you're, you're in
that, what, what prison did
you go to? I was in several.

1529
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:01,060
I started out in Fcc New York. I did
two years there waiting to be sentenced.

1530
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:05,180
So that's a state, it's, it's
diff 10 all federal, federal.

1531
01:26:05,181 --> 01:26:07,400
And then it's not the camp that
you think it is, by the way.

1532
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:11,630
And then I was sent out to Mariana
Florida and uh, that's nice weather.

1533
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:15,720
Well, there's 105 in the summer.
I had to go outside. Oh yeah. No.

1534
01:26:15,721 --> 01:26:19,280
What happened was I was in isolation
for nine months in nine months in total

1535
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:21,440
isolation in MCC, New York.
And what is that like?

1536
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:23,570
It's the worst thing in the world.

1537
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,360
It's total deprivation
and sensory deprivation.

1538
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:29,810
Every it's lights on all
the time. Uh, not always,

1539
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,030
but depending upon the
location you were at,

1540
01:26:32,031 --> 01:26:35,870
sometimes they keep a light
on so that they can see you,
you know, so, you know, so,

1541
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,360
but it does it feel
like the worst thing is,

1542
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:43,361
the worst thing about being in isolation
is your loss of interpersonal skills,

1543
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,990
which I, I don't know if I have any, any
way, but it just, when you pass people,

1544
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,440
like in a physical manner, you don't
know whether they're going to stab you.

1545
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,480
You should stay up there and he should
hug them. You should shake their hand.

1546
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:57,560
It's, it's total. Um,
it's hard to explain,

1547
01:26:57,561 --> 01:27:01,760
but it's like that physical presence of
another person next to you and you in

1548
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:05,420
your space. I mean you're, you're
a fighter. You know, you're a cop.

1549
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:07,910
Someone gets in a certain space,
you need to protect yourself.

1550
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,480
But being a convict slash inmate,
slash,

1551
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:13,880
prisoner when someone steps
in your personal space,

1552
01:27:13,881 --> 01:27:15,680
of course you need to check them,

1553
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:19,040
but when you're in isolation
you don't know what it is.

1554
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:24,090
Like your personal space becomes
whatever you can grasp whenever you can

1555
01:27:25,191 --> 01:27:26,024
control.

1556
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:31,120
So when I was first example was my
first pass somebody, we had a room,

1557
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,260
let's say the size of your
studio here and he was like,

1558
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,930
he was out on the floor and I was
out on the floor at the same time,

1559
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:38,870
which is very odd, my situation because
I never was, I wasn't around anybody.

1560
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:42,490
I didn't know what to do. You know,
how to respond to his presence in my,

1561
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:43,400
in my world.

1562
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,040
And he was another guy that was also in
solitary for a short period until he was,

1563
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:48,470
he just got in trouble for something.

1564
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:51,890
But at that point I was probably getting
at that moment probably five or six

1565
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:55,910
months when I was five or six months with
no contact, except when they feed you.

1566
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:58,580
Right. And when they feed
you, they talked to, you know,

1567
01:27:58,581 --> 01:28:02,220
they throw the food through a slot and
you go, no one says anything to you.

1568
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:06,490
Very little, very little interaction.
How are you today? You know? Yeah. Good.

1569
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:10,280
I'm good. Great. I just
finished another book. It okay,

1570
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:15,410
so that's the entire extent of your
human interaction for nine months.

1571
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,110
It's essentially, yes, I
do. You do get visits, uh,

1572
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:23,000
once a week or something like that for
an hour. What? Your family members. Wow.

1573
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:25,630
You know, that's, you know, it's a
little different cause she's, you know,

1574
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:30,230
it's a warm thing, you know, but people
that are criminals, convicts and same,

1575
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:32,880
you're not really touchy,
Lovey, feely type thing.

1576
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:36,630
So you don't know how to respond,
you know? Yeah. I would imagine like,

1577
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,480
but didn't Bradley Manning,

1578
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:43,481
I think he was in for like two years
plus before he became Chelsea manning.

1579
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,280
Right.
Two years plus solitary.

1580
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:50,030
No interaction with anyone
at and I believe no clothes
because they were worried

1581
01:28:50,031 --> 01:28:53,730
about him killing himself or herself.
I don't know when,

1582
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:58,820
when does the transition, when do you
officially say him or her? Either way,

1583
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:02,040
but like I've heard it argued that like

1584
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,140
you go insane.
Like if you,

1585
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:07,290
if you leave someone alone for two or
three years and there's no interaction at

1586
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:10,020
all with other people, yeah. You
might as well just fucking shoot.

1587
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,850
You guys used to sleep
underneath their bed,

1588
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:15,410
put the mattress on top of the bed
and sleep underneath it underneath.

1589
01:29:15,411 --> 01:29:19,410
Like there's the bed. We
hang up the walls. I Dunno, I
didn't want to ask him. Wow.

1590
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:22,830
It was just like, that's what they
life became. You become insane. They,

1591
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:25,320
pappy mason is at one of
the guys that he killed her

1592
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:29,170
competent. Uh, it was responsible
for the killing of Eddie Burns.

1593
01:29:29,171 --> 01:29:30,310
I think one of the,

1594
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:33,430
one of the offices that was executed
and he used to sleep under his bed.

1595
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:36,040
It was part of the fact
that he wanted to be,

1596
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:37,210
you know,

1597
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:41,220
him to be cycled rather than be
responsible for what he was doing things.

1598
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,540
But then it became him. Ooh. Yeah.

1599
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,470
It's dreads were fucking
like 12 feet long.

1600
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:52,740
He's life became whatever, you know, I
have no sympathy for what, but he did.

1601
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:55,320
But just people,
human beings in general.

1602
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:57,990
That's what happens when they start
to go on the other side of that. Well,

1603
01:29:57,991 --> 01:30:01,100
the thing about the Bradley manning cases,
if more fucked up cause,

1604
01:30:01,101 --> 01:30:02,940
cause all he did was exposed crime.

1605
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:07,170
I mean that was the guy who gave away
the wikileaks documentary. Oh, documents.

1606
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:10,090
Okay. And he gave it to Julian
Assange's. Now they're both fucked.

1607
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:13,500
He's the Julian Assange just stuck in a
fucking embassy in London. He can't move.

1608
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:16,890
They just recently,
I think in the last couple of days,

1609
01:30:16,891 --> 01:30:18,540
they got rid of his 24 hour guards,

1610
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:22,980
had guards outside the gate making sure
he didn't bolt and now and now they're

1611
01:30:22,981 --> 01:30:27,900
like, yeah, fuck he stays, he's done.
Yeah. It wasn't gonna go stuck in this,

1612
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:32,580
I think the Ecuador Embassy.
And, uh, so he's fucked there.

1613
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:37,640
And then Chelsea manning is fucked in
jail forever and they're never going to

1614
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:39,240
let her out now.
And that's it.

1615
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:42,660
And it's all exposing crime,

1616
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,140
which is even more fucked up because
Julian Assange is not a criminal.

1617
01:30:46,141 --> 01:30:47,910
Bradley Manning, he's not a
crowd other than, you know,

1618
01:30:47,911 --> 01:30:52,220
the crime of exposing government
corruption and documents.

1619
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:55,440
I'll give you an interesting detail
and one of the hundreds of stories,

1620
01:30:55,750 --> 01:31:00,500
uh, my boys, they do a
shakedown. They, they hit, they
hit, they robbed this Bodega,

1621
01:31:00,501 --> 01:31:04,670
which is why chickie and Walter become my
buddy. I mentioned it briefly before. So

1622
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:10,140
they're out on bail. Walt is living in
my house and Trimboli one of the, uh,

1623
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:12,260
internal affairs detective
is constantly at my house,

1624
01:31:12,261 --> 01:31:16,100
like surveilling my house and
Shit. Right. And Walter, uh,

1625
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,960
chickies out on bail, getting ready
to do a little nine month bit.

1626
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:22,400
Walter's getting ready to go upstate for
two and a half years cause he's like,

1627
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:27,220
he was on duty and he was the police
officer that was still on the job. And um,

1628
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:29,383
so

1629
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:34,910
I find out that they get
ready to go to trial.

1630
01:31:34,911 --> 01:31:38,930
Now they're all putting herself,
this is prior to them please.

1631
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:44,030
They get ready to go to trial. So I get
in touch with Barron and I tell Baron,

1632
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:48,560
tell the owner to Bodega that he needs
to leave the country right away because

1633
01:31:48,561 --> 01:31:51,480
trials coming up in a week.
So

1634
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,900
barren reaches out and tells the guy that,
you know,

1635
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:01,120
the cops stopped by my office today and
said, you guys got to leave the country.

1636
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:05,950
You know, you got to leave the
country. And he says, and you know,

1637
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:09,100
you gotta leave because things can get
bad if you don't leave the country.

1638
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:12,220
So guy leaves country.

1639
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:15,910
Immediately I got a phone
call from one of the guys,

1640
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:17,800
whether it was Walter with
chickie says to fucking trials,

1641
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:22,300
but they don't know the trial has
been postponed. I said, okay, good.

1642
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,170
I don't know the details, but
I know he's gone. The Guy,

1643
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:27,700
I'd had them leave the country.
So

1644
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:32,620
about eight or 10 months later,
the case is ready to fall apart.

1645
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:38,200
Internal Affairs goes and arrests
this guy's wife or sister.

1646
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,480
She's working some bookies spot, uh,
one of those bodegas that sales numbers.

1647
01:32:43,481 --> 01:32:46,790
And didn't really sell
food. And uh, the rest,

1648
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,490
his wife tell them they're
gonna deport her and take her,

1649
01:32:48,491 --> 01:32:52,840
keep her kids and put them in PC.
BCW One of those bureau of Child Welfare.

1650
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,160
So we'll call you, call your brother
and tell him to get back. Yeah,

1651
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:00,100
I can't come back. They're going
to have me killed by the Aba.

1652
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:04,690
So he comes back on the protection
and the trial goes forward.

1653
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:09,670
But the fact is that what I'm getting at
and what I'm telling you is that's what

1654
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:11,470
you can actually do when you were a cop.

1655
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:14,140
If you really don't want
something to happen,

1656
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:17,380
you could actually have that kind
of control over a situation. Well,

1657
01:33:17,381 --> 01:33:20,140
because I mean, it wasn't them who
did it. It was, it was us who did it.

1658
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,520
We had this guy leave the country.

1659
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:25,890
So these are the stories
that the book layout or,

1660
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,960
or even if the movie takes a
spin in that direction, I mean,

1661
01:33:28,961 --> 01:33:31,990
there's really some intense shit
that we were able to do. I mean,

1662
01:33:31,991 --> 01:33:35,050
if a guy put a complaint in against us,
we call it was house,

1663
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:37,200
you know,

1664
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,270
if you wanted to complain that the cop
some treated me unfairly or something

1665
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:44,050
like that. Really, you know,

1666
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,380
you got to realize what
you were dealing with.

1667
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,110
Well that kind of shit
goes on to this day,

1668
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:52,450
that kind of subtle versions of that.
I,

1669
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:55,500
I'm not looking at disparage anybody here.

1670
01:33:55,501 --> 01:33:58,660
I'm just telling you what we were able
to do by understanding in order to keep

1671
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,580
our moving the ball forward. Right. You
know, that's the way you could do things,

1672
01:34:03,581 --> 01:34:06,460
you know, uh, if I put it, what they
call the civilian complaint in against,

1673
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:10,300
let's say yourself and you are my either
my, my buddy, one of my coworkers,

1674
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:13,570
you're not going to go to the guy's
house and you know, and say anything,

1675
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:17,530
but you might have your friends sit in
front of his house for a week and just

1676
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:21,640
freak them out. You, I have
to do anything. Right. I think
it's enough. It's pretty,

1677
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:26,110
it's pretty clear how we did
that. The cello, the, the,
uh, the kingpin drug dealer.

1678
01:34:26,111 --> 01:34:29,560
And then that's when he tried to threaten
to kill me, man for the movie. Get Out.

1679
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:33,220
He put her head on me because I sat in
front of his Bodega cause he showed her

1680
01:34:33,221 --> 01:34:36,560
the $700. I sat in front
of his Bodega for, um,

1681
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:38,650
all week probably,

1682
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:42,430
and then he notified Barron
that he put a hit out on me.

1683
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,780
I don't know if that was part of the
fluff for the reality is so barren and

1684
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:48,010
called me and he says,
there's a hit on you.

1685
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:52,870
So that's when I went and I found them
the next day and day one, whatever it was,

1686
01:34:52,871 --> 01:34:57,750
and uh, pulled them over and, uh,
confronted him in the street. And uh,

1687
01:34:57,830 --> 01:35:02,240
he called it off and got my 700 bucks
though, which was a nice day. Kenny says,

1688
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:04,850
I never gave him the three 50. He's
got to be full of Shit. I mean, what?

1689
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:07,910
And he that he, oh, he wasn't there. Like
I said, I'm not sure. I don't remember,

1690
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:12,500
you know. Wow. Um, now
when you go away, okay,

1691
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:16,580
you do your nine months in solitary,
right. Why did they put you in solitary?

1692
01:35:16,581 --> 01:35:19,670
Initially cop, because you're a
cop, but just to protect you. Yeah.

1693
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:23,330
So once you get out of solitary, yeah.
Now you're in with everybody else.

1694
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:27,280
And what is that like?
Yeah.

1695
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,880
Should I go back? Solid area is
this maximum security, minimum,

1696
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,320
maximum high security.

1697
01:35:33,321 --> 01:35:36,050
So you're dealing with everybody
that was in late with the guys.

1698
01:35:36,051 --> 01:35:38,300
So you named him their names there
that I was there with them. You know,

1699
01:35:38,301 --> 01:35:41,330
the [inaudible] crew
was on the 11th floor.

1700
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:46,120
I was on the ninth floor or the seventh
floor, you know, and MCC and uh,

1701
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,390
so I mean guys,
for whatever,

1702
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:50,630
all the gang bangers were in there
that were around that time. You know,

1703
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,730
some of my good buddies, we're were, were
cop impersonators, you know, they were,

1704
01:35:55,731 --> 01:35:58,580
uh, one of those gangs that was
going out, basically executing.

1705
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:00,650
I was an executing anybody,
but they were, you know,

1706
01:36:00,651 --> 01:36:03,020
they were going in his cops and execute
and the drug dealers taking their money.

1707
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:07,250
So they going in with lights,
the whole deal. All badges,

1708
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,600
coach bulletproof vests,
38 Smith and Wessons and taking people,

1709
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:14,120
killing people and taking their drugs.
I mean that was the 80s.

1710
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:17,750
And it's Brooklyn and Manhattan
and the Bronx. And when,

1711
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:22,810
when you're in there and you
go from solitary to just,

1712
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:26,390
just general population or a population
or watch it back every to every step of

1713
01:36:26,391 --> 01:36:29,390
the way, what does that, what
does that like? Eh, you know,

1714
01:36:29,391 --> 01:36:32,300
it's like how when I was driving to work
one and if I was getting arrested every

1715
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,010
day,
what was the first day like the first day?

1716
01:36:34,011 --> 01:36:37,520
Like they let you out and now all of a
sudden do you have to share a cell with

1717
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:40,880
somebody? Yeah. Who was
the, um, I can't recall.

1718
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,250
You don't know who you should have
saw with that? There was hundreds.

1719
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,610
Hundreds of guys. Yeah. Just different
gods all times. All the time.

1720
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:51,410
We were in transition in MCC, New
York. You're in transition. You know,

1721
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:55,470
I ended up sharing a cell with patsy conti
one time was one of the wise guys. Uh,

1722
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:55,790
you know,

1723
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:58,910
they tried to keep the white guys
with the white guys cause prisons very

1724
01:36:58,911 --> 01:37:03,200
racially divided, divisive, you
know, black guys with black guys,

1725
01:37:03,201 --> 01:37:05,240
white guys with white guys. That's
how it, how it was, you know,

1726
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:07,130
Spanish guys and Spanish guys,
you know.

1727
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:10,140
So that's just the way prison now
do you have to align yourself with a

1728
01:37:10,141 --> 01:37:12,590
particular groups or anything while
you're in this and no one's going to lend

1729
01:37:12,591 --> 01:37:16,370
themselves with me, you know, but happen
chances that when you're in MCC, New York,

1730
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:20,900
it's like
60% black guys,

1731
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:24,920
35% Hispanic guys,
2% Asian and 1% white.

1732
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:27,230
So thank you.
Missing some numbers.

1733
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:34,700
Don't hold me to the, let me
get my pen out. So it was, yeah.

1734
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:38,690
And so like, even if you were a wise
guy in the street, you saw a white face,

1735
01:37:38,691 --> 01:37:41,990
you know, you talked whether you liked
each other or not, you know, I understand.

1736
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,750
And you know, being that with young
and still a little, uh, you know, not,

1737
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:46,820
I was pretty good shape at this point.

1738
01:37:46,821 --> 01:37:50,070
Now down about a year or so
and doing probably, you know,

1739
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:54,930
push 600 800 pushups, pushups a
day, Chin ups, dips, back, bends,

1740
01:37:55,540 --> 01:37:59,940
and the whole bit, right? Right now
I'm in great shape. I'm doing the bar,

1741
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:02,500
I'm doing 160 Chet pullups a,

1742
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:06,330
you know what's backwards and people see
you moving around. They're like, okay,

1743
01:38:06,331 --> 01:38:09,090
you know, this isn't an easy trip.
Right, right, right. No matter how,

1744
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:12,820
what do you think of me? It was a cop and
I, it wasn't an easy ride. So, and then,

1745
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:16,050
you know, all the older wise guys, you
know, their feeble guys, most of them,

1746
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:18,820
when he finally got arrested,
most of them are banged up anyway.

1747
01:38:18,821 --> 01:38:22,950
There's 65 70 you know, and what happens
to those guys when they get in? Well,

1748
01:38:22,951 --> 01:38:27,030
they align themselves with a young guy
does most of their bidding and hopefully

1749
01:38:27,031 --> 01:38:30,770
you don't have to take a knife for one
of them or something like that. But look,

1750
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,180
they got money when you've got money in
prison, it's like money in the street,

1751
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:35,730
you know, and when you're in, okay.

1752
01:38:35,731 --> 01:38:39,660
So when you go from being in
solitary to general population,

1753
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:43,650
like what are your days like? What did
well, there's different worlds, you know,

1754
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:47,310
MCC, new neocon, you're in a
jail, so you're really just
inside the building and,

1755
01:38:47,311 --> 01:38:50,780
and, and, and some people have jobs,
some people don't jog meetings.

1756
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:51,421
They go to the kitchen,

1757
01:38:51,421 --> 01:38:55,270
they cook and they provide meals for
the rest of the prison. I was in a,

1758
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:59,890
like an orderly, I have to clean a
floor or something like that. And um,

1759
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,660
basically sat there and waited and took
it sentenced. It was horrible. You know,

1760
01:39:03,661 --> 01:39:06,050
you sat inside a building,
you know you're coming. Yeah.

1761
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,700
It looked like a piece of paper white.
You got no son,

1762
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:11,940
you got no vitamin C or D or B,
e or g,

1763
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:13,950
whatever the fuck the
vitamins are from the sun.

1764
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:17,580
They got none of them and the food's
horrible and you can't wait to get

1765
01:39:17,581 --> 01:39:18,420
sentenced.
Right.

1766
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:22,350
Cause you want to go out and live a life
now being sentenced prisoner opposed to

1767
01:39:22,351 --> 01:39:27,330
a prisoner in waiting like a bride and
waiting, you finally get out. You know?

1768
01:39:27,331 --> 01:39:29,400
So how long has this waiting period was?
Two years.

1769
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,960
So for two years or nine
months instead of military.

1770
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:35,130
And then another year or 15 months,

1771
01:39:35,131 --> 01:39:38,970
you're just in this jail waiting to be
sentenced. So finally get sentenced.

1772
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:42,530
Once they get sent to I get put on a lia
jet. It was like first class I could,

1773
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:43,050
yeah,

1774
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:48,050
I could take it from MCC new you'll
welcome to in a limousine prison limousine

1775
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:53,850
to over to uh, um, uh, Teterboro airport
with a, with a federal jet is Lia jet.

1776
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,010
Me and like two other people
get on this jet and we,

1777
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,740
they whisk us off to a
two people. Yeah. W Yeah,

1778
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:04,560
they whisk us off to Florida. We land in
Jacksonville. We pick up some, some girl,

1779
01:40:04,561 --> 01:40:06,630
I don't know.
And then the Wisconsin West.

1780
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:11,010
So this is how they transport prisoners.
They put them in a federal jet. Yeah.

1781
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,930
Yeah. Wouldn't my case in my case, because
I was getting, I was leading the, the,

1782
01:40:15,931 --> 01:40:20,130
the, the region. They have
a big bus. Normally they'll,

1783
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:22,050
they'll deposit yet along the way.

1784
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,930
And then some people get moved
around on different size jets. Just,

1785
01:40:24,931 --> 01:40:28,180
this happened to be a, which is like four
or five passenger jet, which was nice,

1786
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:30,580
but I have done that. I'm sorry,
federal, like a VIP and this is right.

1787
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:35,160
This is great. I love this.
Peanuts, nuts, lots of nuts,

1788
01:40:36,110 --> 01:40:37,250
but no peanuts.

1789
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,560
So then it was a cute girl on the
fucking playing with me. I'm like, well,

1790
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:47,220
isn't that a girl prisoner? How'd that
work out? I don't remember her name,

1791
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,190
but anyway, she was cute and
you have to look at something.

1792
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:53,920
She just elbow me a little bit.
You know? Where's she? I Dunno.

1793
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:55,990
To a woman's prison in Tallahassee.
What does she do?

1794
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,930
I don't know if we don't
talk to ask her questions,

1795
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:04,450
but I'm fucking trying to keep my,
my world smaller. When you were,

1796
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:07,780
when you were a guy like me in prison,
you don't open your mouth.

1797
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:11,290
You don't talk to anybody. You don't
elicit a conversation with anybody.

1798
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:15,130
That'd be really difficult for
you, I would imagine. Horrible.

1799
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,400
It was like pulling my tongue out and
throw it on the ground for fucking 12

1800
01:41:18,401 --> 01:41:20,410
years. So you just doing
this for survival purposes,

1801
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,010
state your own little world you open,
cause he opened yourself up.

1802
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:27,640
People want either in or to to
use things against you. You know,

1803
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:30,700
like in the ref free world. But in this
case there, it's a microcosm. Right.

1804
01:41:30,701 --> 01:41:31,990
You know,
if come back to your real quick,

1805
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:36,340
the way people use information
against you. Wow. So, so I,

1806
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:40,110
so I feel from there and then I ended
up in some small county jail, uh,

1807
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:43,980
which I ended up with one of the guys
from cocaine cowboy who ends up dying. Uh,

1808
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:46,330
if you bought it from, a couple of them
did. But this fella, he was telling me,

1809
01:41:46,331 --> 01:41:48,550
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here and
I'm in the county jail. And he's like,

1810
01:41:48,551 --> 01:41:52,470
well a piece of Barb wire around this
fence and he's telling me there's a guy in

1811
01:41:52,471 --> 01:41:56,200
a, in a, in a, in a tree tree house. It's
like I get a tree house with a shotgun.

1812
01:41:56,230 --> 01:41:59,830
That's it. A shotgun. Yeah. That's
it. What's security for this?

1813
01:41:59,831 --> 01:42:02,350
For this little county jail,
but their shotgun. Yeah.

1814
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:04,060
He said that they would show far away.
Is he

1815
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:09,940
60 80 feet from the Bob white
fence? Oh yeah. Some kill Ya.

1816
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,760
16 Gotcha.
If he's not sleeping,

1817
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:17,400
but they're only making 10 $12,000
a year. Oh. So he's saying,

1818
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:20,140
and he's big money cocaine count.
We guys,

1819
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:23,080
he's thinking he could have some
money sent to this guy's fucking,

1820
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:25,000
I don't know his mother.
Who the fuck knows?

1821
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:28,000
All you have to do is give the
guy something to puts him out.

1822
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:30,130
If some chew tobacco,

1823
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,370
you just give them a
pill that knocks him out.

1824
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:36,550
Like tell him you're going to hit
me responsible. I'm gonna give you,

1825
01:42:36,551 --> 01:42:39,280
I'm going to dummy up your dress and
I'm going to jump and no one's going to

1826
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:42,100
know how it happened. You're going to
wake up. We should huddle of your own.

1827
01:42:42,101 --> 01:42:45,760
He said, done time together. That's where
I would have done. This is real simple.

1828
01:42:45,761 --> 01:42:50,440
Here go 48 you know these guys,
I mean, they weren't that young,

1829
01:42:50,441 --> 01:42:51,490
but these guys, you know, they wouldn't,

1830
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:53,890
they were already fighting for
their lives. When El Chapo,

1831
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:57,820
when that guy got out and he dug
that hole a mile long run underneath,

1832
01:42:57,821 --> 01:43:02,180
they gave him a pill. No, but didn't
you respect that? I respect that.

1833
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:03,520
I'm not even put pot.

1834
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:08,850
The fact that they had the fucking the
thought process involved and this is no,

1835
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:12,750
but I mean still,
I was like I gotta respect it.

1836
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:17,360
Had to know that I made a fucking mile
long tunnel willing tricity the money

1837
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:20,620
you'll get wet when you got that kind
of money you're getting out. Okay.

1838
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:23,710
And there's a lot of people getting
paid to along the way that he's got a

1839
01:43:23,711 --> 01:43:26,360
hundred million dollar bounty
on Donald Trump. Oh really?

1840
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,150
Trump talk shit about Mexicans too much.

1841
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:34,680
Let's not talk politics here
cause political assassinations
are political too.

1842
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,120
But when guys want to get out,

1843
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:41,290
you know and you all day all that's all
you're thinking about the stuff they

1844
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:44,350
were digging out more. I was too, but
they stick out. They caught them. Yeah.

1845
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:46,310
The thing it was someone
gets you up right?

1846
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:51,250
Cause they cause they want to go to with
a better place. Like, like, let's say you,

1847
01:43:51,251 --> 01:43:53,680
I mean, I ended up in Mariana, well
let me, let me tell you this. Okay.

1848
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:57,500
So we get off the bus and I'm like,
this is going to be fucking horrible.

1849
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:58,860
I can do another now at this point,
another,

1850
01:43:58,861 --> 01:44:01,790
the 10 and a half years like this walking
the fucking place like this and it's

1851
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:05,870
hot. It's fucking the middle of the
summer. Like I say, July, whatever it was,

1852
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:08,870
and panhandle of Florida, it's
fucking hot. It's a hundred.

1853
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:10,970
And I get off the bus and I see this,

1854
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:14,630
you know this fence and gate and shit
and then it looks okay, you know,

1855
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:18,020
and they bring you into r. And.
D. It's like you're a package.

1856
01:44:18,021 --> 01:44:20,800
They're bringing into R. And, d,
they process you, they give you the,

1857
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:24,470
if you had to see him on TV,
they got the fucking bags,

1858
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:28,450
they've got their bedroll dead role in
their hand that has something that glows

1859
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:32,750
and Shit, and you're walking through
this compound and this God opens a God,

1860
01:44:32,751 --> 01:44:35,120
whatever pack he opens up the,

1861
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:38,630
the report to this compound.

1862
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:41,550
And I say to myself,
strike me dead now.

1863
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,030
I just came from a fucking hole
in the wall for years. Right?

1864
01:44:44,031 --> 01:44:48,830
Two years I've been looking at nothing
but cement and Polish on the floor and he

1865
01:44:48,831 --> 01:44:53,090
opens it up and I see the
luscious fucking place I problem.

1866
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,910
Other than the my vacations
in the Cayman Islands,

1867
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,940
this was the most picturesque
place I've ever seen.

1868
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:01,640
Like up close and in person
now it doesn't matter.

1869
01:45:01,641 --> 01:45:02,900
It's two years I've been seeing cement.

1870
01:45:02,901 --> 01:45:07,370
So I mean lush flowers
call is beautiful grass,

1871
01:45:07,371 --> 01:45:11,390
beautiful cement. Gorgeous. A big
beautiful Chow Hall. What my name?

1872
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:13,160
My name's st come and eat.

1873
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:16,100
You know I haven't had a good meal and
fucked him forever. And the food was good.

1874
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:21,290
I was eating fucking Hash, right? Food's
going to be good in a lot of Wa wa.

1875
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:25,940
So I go like this, I go to myself,
I know this is fucking paradise.

1876
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:29,480
Swear to God. I just finished
saying it and the God goes,

1877
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:32,930
welcome to Paradise. Whoa. Like this.

1878
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:37,940
Like the thing we have to
know code hilarious and I'm
going to this fucking guy.

1879
01:45:37,941 --> 01:45:41,900
I don't want to let them know
that I agree. Why fucking agree.

1880
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,780
So when he's saying welcome to Paris,

1881
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:47,690
he fucking with you or is he know
because he knows where I just came fry.

1882
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:51,130
You understand? And he knows that
this, this is nice. It's a, it's a,

1883
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:55,750
it's a college campus with fences
around it, you know, but the habit,

1884
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:59,600
the inhabitants are not quite right.
You know,

1885
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:01,580
the average sentence was,
uh,

1886
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:06,260
I think 18 years when I worked in that
place and it was 300 and I want to say 40

1887
01:46:06,261 --> 01:46:09,410
some odd men that would never going home
that it was, now I'm going to bunk with,

1888
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:14,150
okay, those are the dangerous ones. Right.
You know what, that Elise dangerous,

1889
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:19,250
there were nothing to lose guys,
not the ones that are doing their time,

1890
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,440
you know, why are they
the least dangerous? Well,

1891
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:24,290
because they just want to live
their lives out. You know,

1892
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:27,950
with the young bucks that you know
that to just want to make a name for

1893
01:46:27,951 --> 01:46:31,250
themselves and that they don't see,
they don't see the 10 years,

1894
01:46:31,251 --> 01:46:32,660
15 years from now,
they're going home.

1895
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:35,540
They just see the same immediate
gratification that got them there.

1896
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:40,610
So right now I like your sneakers or
I like your fucking soup, you know,

1897
01:46:40,611 --> 01:46:43,490
and I don't have any soup cause my
parents, I don't even know my parents.

1898
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:45,540
You know what I mean? And so I
don't get the extras, you know,

1899
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:48,770
prisons about extras. You know, if you
get extras in prison, you'll, you'll,

1900
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:52,330
you know, so explain that
to me. Commissary. You know,

1901
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:55,800
people live on commissary
in prison because it's like,

1902
01:46:55,801 --> 01:46:56,940
it's like as part of rebellion,

1903
01:46:56,970 --> 01:46:59,640
no one wants to be beholden to the
government for what they're going to give

1904
01:46:59,641 --> 01:47:04,170
them. So when you go into prison, yeah,
you'd get good square meal, you know,

1905
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:07,540
food's okay. You know, it's cooked
for fucking 1800 men. Right.

1906
01:47:08,150 --> 01:47:12,210
There's plenty of it. It's
a control mechanism. Okay.

1907
01:47:12,211 --> 01:47:14,120
Food is a control mechanism,
exercises,

1908
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:16,620
control mechanism and all the frills
that control mechanisms and how do you

1909
01:47:16,621 --> 01:47:20,250
control population, water, food,

1910
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:24,090
sex that they can't have. So certain
things are controlled mechanism,

1911
01:47:24,091 --> 01:47:27,270
food and exercise in prison
as a control mechanism. So

1912
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:32,280
the way to control guys is to, to, to
provide them with, with a good meal.

1913
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,980
And you don't want to lose
that good fucking meall. Right.

1914
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:36,360
So you're gonna be good.

1915
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:39,390
Cause cause I just came from a
place where I was eating shit of a,

1916
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:42,200
of a plastic container all day long.

1917
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:46,590
Now I get a plate with a knife and a fork.
I can eat like a gentleman. You know,

1918
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:50,680
you start to feel like a
human being again. But upon
with the guy, next years is,

1919
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:53,700
you know, you don't want to take
him home necessarily, you know,

1920
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:57,690
so he listens to me. The guy next to
you is not getting the same food. No,

1921
01:47:57,691 --> 01:48:02,180
he's getting the same and he wants
that. Right. So he went to keep the,

1922
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:05,460
maintain the status quo. So if he's
down there doing a life sentence,

1923
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:10,000
he's okay with this cause he's accepted
it. It's the young guys that think that,

1924
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:12,600
you know, they want your
food or they, you know,

1925
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:15,090
they want to get over the
good that get over mentality.

1926
01:48:15,091 --> 01:48:17,070
You have to let go of
that get over mentality.

1927
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:20,160
Otherwise you're going to live that
fucking happy life in prison and get over

1928
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:24,420
mentality. Meaning you're always looking
to get ahead a little bit. Scam a little,

1929
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:27,870
this scam a little easier.
Some mags sell them to this guy.

1930
01:48:27,871 --> 01:48:30,030
A lot of people send
money home from prison,

1931
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,170
so it turns into another rat race that
you know. When you say the commissary,

1932
01:48:34,171 --> 01:48:36,930
like what? What do you, what can
you get at a connoisseur? Well,

1933
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:38,540
one of the biggest things stamps,

1934
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:43,220
so he can use that to bought her stamps
is currency stamps into an official

1935
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:46,860
currency in prison. So you could
send letters, you can send letters.

1936
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:51,570
So you have to have stamps, scandal,
you can gamble to come. Yeah, right.

1937
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:53,880
What kind of gambling? Well, sports,

1938
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:56,690
usually it's sports gambling and then
there's cards, you know, and it's called,

1939
01:48:56,691 --> 01:48:59,070
it's a checkers and chess, you
know, people gamble on anything.

1940
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,680
So can you watch games
and stuff like that? Well,

1941
01:49:01,681 --> 01:49:05,380
the unit I stayed in had five or six
TVs really in, in a common area. Yeah.

1942
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,870
One had the rap station on,

1943
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:11,930
one had a basketball all the time
and the other one had Spanish TV.

1944
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:14,550
So then you had CNN once in a while,

1945
01:49:14,551 --> 01:49:17,230
which we sold the nine 11 attack and it
will come out looking at me, my eyes.

1946
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:20,460
Did you see what happened?
I'm like, uh, okay. You know,

1947
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,140
they look to you because you were a cost.

1948
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:24,250
Of course I was from New
York and I was oh right.

1949
01:49:24,330 --> 01:49:27,040
You know all the staff and everybody came
over. You know, that was, it was, it was,

1950
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:30,160
it was a difficult fucking moment
to say the least. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1951
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:32,100
So I went to a lot of
that stuff in prison.

1952
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:36,570
So when the comments are you can get
extra things. That's for food after food.

1953
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:41,280
Yeah. What kind of food? Like I
said, tuna, fish, octopus. Oh yeah.

1954
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,140
Some places. Yeah. So yeah, we got
to buy it. How much does it cost?

1955
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:49,190
If you paid a dollar for a tuner and
the street, it was two 50 in the air.

1956
01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:51,160
Let that type of thing, you know,
or whatever the current rate is.

1957
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:54,250
You paid a little bit more
in prison. Yeah. And then
if you're working in prison,

1958
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:55,990
you very little money,
you get very little money.

1959
01:49:55,991 --> 01:49:58,510
So the money from the outside
is what you'll be maintained.

1960
01:49:58,511 --> 01:50:01,180
So guys that go to prison and have
outside connections with family that would

1961
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:06,030
still help them support themselves become
a commodity in prison. So you know, you,

1962
01:50:06,610 --> 01:50:08,160
you're a hustler in prison,
so you,

1963
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:10,570
you would like to take extra
eggs and make some exile.

1964
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:13,390
Let's say it cause the guys work
out all day long. It's what they do,

1965
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:14,800
increase their protein,

1966
01:50:14,801 --> 01:50:17,680
they want to stay in shape because
they want to go home one day, you know?

1967
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:21,730
And so you learn to adjust your life
in order that you have an end game.

1968
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:25,440
Some kids only cared about today,
you know, and they signed him,

1969
01:50:25,450 --> 01:50:28,690
don't go home because they ended up
getting in a fight or stabbing, killed,

1970
01:50:28,691 --> 01:50:31,910
whatever. And then they get another
bid, they get on the bed because I had,

1971
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,280
and there you go.

1972
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,630
So is that what you did most of
your time down there in Florida?

1973
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:41,380
Five years plus in Marianna, Florida. And
then I wanted to get closer to family,

1974
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:43,950
you know, so cause I was
getting ready to be Libby least,

1975
01:50:43,951 --> 01:50:45,400
that had not been seven years.

1976
01:50:45,401 --> 01:50:48,280
I am anticipating and release
in about three or four years,

1977
01:50:48,281 --> 01:50:51,910
which didn't turn out. And, uh, I
lost a year when I got on a plane,

1978
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:56,280
which is a legal argument that I made for
the next five years and lost. But, uh,

1979
01:50:56,290 --> 01:50:58,180
I wanted a year off down in Marianna,

1980
01:50:58,181 --> 01:51:01,630
Florida for my drug program participation
and, but had to go to court to get it.

1981
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:05,040
So when I got on a plane to come back
to Devon's Massachusetts where I served,

1982
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:08,350
uh, in a or mass, and if you're familiar
with that area of Massachusetts at all,

1983
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:13,240
whereas air, what's air?
It's near from the W uh,

1984
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:17,450
fort Devins on, um, it's, it's a,

1985
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:22,290
it's west West of Boston,
about 45 miles. Okay.

1986
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:28,150
Washed, washed Worcester. It's near
worse demand. Okay. Um, anyway,

1987
01:51:28,151 --> 01:51:30,610
so they had to open a new federal prison
there and I want to get closer to my

1988
01:51:30,611 --> 01:51:34,270
family. So I ended up getting on a plane.
You know, you request, you make a request,

1989
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:37,630
got on a plane, they've fulfilled
my request. They ended up in Devon,

1990
01:51:37,631 --> 01:51:39,520
Massachusetts.
And when I got off the plane,

1991
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:43,900
I lost a year off of my sentence because
I now know different legal jurisdiction

1992
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:46,720
than the legal jurisdiction
that I was in in Florida too.

1993
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,050
You have to do an extra
year because of it.

1994
01:51:48,051 --> 01:51:52,150
So I got the put back onto my sentence
Dierdorf and I just wanted to fucking, ah,

1995
01:51:52,210 --> 01:51:55,400
I was on fucking medications and
it's like, it's like you, I said,

1996
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:58,990
can you just send me
back? They went, no. Oh

1997
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:01,170
yeah.

1998
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:05,410
So I love the federal house to come to
New York because I wanted to be closer to

1999
01:52:05,411 --> 01:52:07,510
my family, so they would get to
know me as I get released, you know,

2000
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:09,870
get closer bond that you family,
make it easier,

2001
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:13,360
make it easy for everybody
visiting a, exactly. And then,

2002
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:14,410
so of course we another the year,

2003
01:52:14,411 --> 01:52:17,740
so I ended up in a fight over that
and physical fist fight, whatever.

2004
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:18,850
I lost my fucking mind.

2005
01:52:18,851 --> 01:52:22,690
And they ended up causing a hunger
strike because a hunter, you,

2006
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:27,250
you want to understand that I organized
one, it wasn't a bad, I couldn't do,

2007
01:52:27,251 --> 01:52:30,040
I can't go six hours without eating.
I'm getting hungry right now.

2008
01:52:31,450 --> 01:52:34,960
I help organize a hunger strike and
I organize a hundreds hunger strip.

2009
01:52:34,961 --> 01:52:37,870
He didn't participate.
I participated for an hour.

2010
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:42,310
I got locked up in an hour. You
don't know. The stories are crazy.

2011
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:46,900
So I ended up in, uh, in MCC, New
York again, a place where I had just,

2012
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:50,780
oh no, back in the fucking hole
over there in isolation. Oh,

2013
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:55,370
Michael is another hunger strike
there. Oh God. And not done.

2014
01:52:55,371 --> 01:52:58,320
They listened to us and uh,
they shipped me out to Mckeon,

2015
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:02,520
Pennsylvania and I did like three
years there. I mean, it just gets old.

2016
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:06,620
It gets tired just going through the
shit and you live the life out there and

2017
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:09,850
you know, I don't need any sympathy by
the way. Just, it is what it is, you know?

2018
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:11,560
Yeah. I know. I'm not
giving you any sample that,

2019
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:12,860
I'm just trying to think about it.

2020
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:16,020
What it was like to add a
year to someone's sentence. I,

2021
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:20,150
they actually called for an ambulance
after he told me, you want an ambulance?

2022
01:53:20,151 --> 01:53:24,490
I'm like, I'm not sure. I
was going down like, right.

2023
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:25,740
I don't know what happens.
It was like,

2024
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:30,180
get up for five years to get this fucking
four years to get the sentence reduced.

2025
01:53:30,190 --> 01:53:32,840
The here and now you're getting
it back to me in one day when I,

2026
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:35,690
cause I got off a plane and you're
bucking state. I hate this fucking state.

2027
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:39,710
Send me back to Florida. I know you
got, you got, here's the good news.

2028
01:53:39,711 --> 01:53:42,140
She says to me, this bitch,
she goes, here's the good news.

2029
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:45,930
The good news is you've got
four years to fight us. Ooh,

2030
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:50,150
I just got finished fight number
four years. Oh, of course.

2031
01:53:50,151 --> 01:53:52,580
So much to fight these
cocksuckers you have no idea.

2032
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:55,910
And I'm living on stamps and the goodwill
of people sending me money and some of

2033
01:53:55,911 --> 01:53:58,520
the money that I earned in prison,
you know, just fucking horrible.

2034
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:02,660
Now are you allowed to make
money off of your case now? Um,

2035
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:07,630
I did a lot of research. My, the
people I'm involved with and you know,

2036
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:11,420
unless there's a specific victim
that was specifically out there,

2037
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:13,910
unless the guy says I stole his
kilos, you know, I don't know.

2038
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:15,650
What's he going to do though?

2039
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:19,190
Say you'd have to prove how many kilos
you sold or didn't get that I, you know,

2040
01:54:19,191 --> 01:54:21,620
so, so it's not like
a violent crime, like,

2041
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:24,590
like Oj Simpson can't make
money off us. Yes. Right.

2042
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:27,950
But the details are slightly different
because, you know, I was, uh,

2043
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:31,130
I don't know why I would fuck you would
call it, but you know, the people that,

2044
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:35,580
that research for me said that there is
the law that some that's understandable

2045
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:38,300
does not directly affect you.
Yeah. It would make sense.

2046
01:54:38,301 --> 01:54:42,980
You have to have a specific thing that
you victimized and then you profit off of

2047
01:54:42,981 --> 01:54:47,840
that for their misinformation. Right,
right, right. That you caused, right.

2048
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:50,850
Yeah.
So this is not that this is the son,

2049
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:54,220
the same executed people on
island, you know, in fact, the guy,

2050
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:56,650
the detective's name is a distant
cousin of mine, Timothy Dow,

2051
01:54:56,651 --> 01:55:01,070
to the rest of them. Really? Yeah. That's
called the son of Sam. Yeah. Yeah. So,

2052
01:55:01,071 --> 01:55:05,750
you know, my family's got the legacy
on both sides, I guess. Pro Con. Um,

2053
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:09,340
now, what is it like the first
day he got out? You know,

2054
01:55:09,341 --> 01:55:13,130
I thought you might ask that
question. [inaudible] yeah. Uh, well,

2055
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:17,780
the first day I got out, um, know
there's this, this different outs. Okay,

2056
01:55:17,781 --> 01:55:20,530
you get rid of it, you get released to
a halfway house. So I was in Mckean,

2057
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:22,630
Pennsylvania.
Now if I finish with my bed and my,

2058
01:55:22,631 --> 01:55:25,430
my parents wanted to send a limousine
to pick me up and welcome me home,

2059
01:55:25,431 --> 01:55:29,270
like a big shot, you know, but not,
not in a boisterous way, just just to,

2060
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:32,840
just to show me, they show
me love, show me love. Right.
So I said, you know what, no,

2061
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:37,870
I want to take the bus home,
the gray hound. So I got on
a Greyhound bus and I, uh,

2062
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:39,890
drove the gray him. I didn't
drive at night. Like I,

2063
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:43,890
it was a passenger on a greyhound
bus to, to MCC, MCC, the bus,

2064
01:55:43,950 --> 01:55:47,670
the bus terminal in new, in Manhattan.
And my family was there waiting for me.

2065
01:55:47,671 --> 01:55:51,000
You know, about 10, 15 of them were
there. It was. It was a nice welcoming,

2066
01:55:51,001 --> 01:55:54,000
but all I can do is say I need a quarter.
And they're like,

2067
01:55:54,001 --> 01:55:57,660
what do you need a quarter four? I said,
I need to fucking make a phone call.

2068
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:00,180
I said, can anyone got a quarter?
I got, I need it right now.

2069
01:56:00,181 --> 01:56:03,640
I'm panicking because I'm running late
and they halfway house and I'm a rule

2070
01:56:03,641 --> 01:56:05,400
follower at some time,
so I don't want to go back.

2071
01:56:05,570 --> 01:56:07,650
So I need to notify the halfway house.

2072
01:56:07,651 --> 01:56:10,010
I'm gonna be running late
because the bus was late. Right.

2073
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:15,500
So all of a sudden people start handing
me these things to talk on what the

2074
01:56:16,701 --> 01:56:20,220
fuck? Cell phones, the phone.

2075
01:56:20,221 --> 01:56:24,300
I go look up, dial it from
me. I never dial up. I don't
know what I'm doing. Right.

2076
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:28,200
So you'd never seen a cell
phone before? Never swore. If
I tell home, I'm like, wow,

2077
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:32,460
that's not true. I showed the original
cell phones, the brick, the bricks.

2078
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:36,600
I was debating on the handle of the
bricks, but now I had no idea what,

2079
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:40,350
you should have one of those things. No,
but my drug dealers did. Oh, all those,

2080
01:56:40,370 --> 01:56:43,260
they have those like the ones
from Gordon Gekko in Wall Street.

2081
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,461
They look like this.

2082
01:56:44,461 --> 01:56:47,340
It was squared and then they had
the ones with the long cords,

2083
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:51,960
they could talk on it. It has a
suitcase. They were my heroes.

2084
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:57,160
I'm calling my house from my wife's going,
what are you calling from? I go, I'm,

2085
01:56:57,180 --> 01:57:00,900
you don't want the book deal was cell
phones right now. The guys, like I said,

2086
01:57:00,990 --> 01:57:02,700
20 favorite race,
that number when I finished talking.

2087
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:08,060
So you call it the halfway house and
now you have to have to live there for

2088
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:10,830
which is back in the ghetto.
I'm back in the ghetto,

2089
01:57:10,831 --> 01:57:14,150
living in a halfway house and a amount
about, I don't know, two, three days and,

2090
01:57:14,151 --> 01:57:17,940
and, and uh, the news, the newspaper would
front circle and like fucking, you know,

2091
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:21,270
bees around honey flies on shit.
They're all over the place.

2092
01:57:21,271 --> 01:57:22,320
And then someone snaps a picture,

2093
01:57:22,321 --> 01:57:25,020
a guy puts it up front page
of the Daily News and said,

2094
01:57:25,021 --> 01:57:28,510
doubts still walks like a comp.
It wasn't me. You walked her car.

2095
01:57:28,770 --> 01:57:30,990
What the fuck does that mean?
Well, you know, we know.

2096
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:34,050
They know what they're saying.
Own a baton.

2097
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:38,010
One white guy and they get a welcome.
Like I owned it.

2098
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:42,690
And so this guy was interesting,
but it wasn't even in your lesson.

2099
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:45,550
Maybe somebody else should the guy
shoes and get to half a million.

2100
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:46,770
I'm still broke. Really? Yeah.

2101
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:50,790
That guy sued and got a half a million
dollar walking like a cop. It was,

2102
01:57:50,791 --> 01:57:53,970
they put his picture on the front page
of the, Oh, that's a miss. And they,

2103
01:57:53,971 --> 01:57:57,040
and they tarnished just criminal
image that said he was a rogue cop.

2104
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:01,240
He was only there for something
else. That's hilarious. Yes.

2105
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:05,230
So he had to deal with that as the daily
news wrote. What was it? Which one?

2106
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:10,080
That was the daily news. Wow,
man. Man, man, man, you go, well,

2107
01:58:10,081 --> 01:58:12,780
how's that? Enough said when people,
yeah, people don't know those,

2108
01:58:12,781 --> 01:58:16,480
those tabloid newspapers in New York,
those are hilarious newspapers.

2109
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,100
The fucking covers are always very funny,
right.

2110
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:21,710
Not when your face is on it for
fucking like six months. Yeah.

2111
01:58:21,890 --> 01:58:26,520
Well I would imagine, did you
save any of those? No, but yes.

2112
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:31,950
No, I mean I didn't want to cabinet my
property when I landed in a different

2113
01:58:31,951 --> 01:58:35,400
institution like, oh, oh this is,
you just put these up on the wall.

2114
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:37,500
Some family members had
like every one I guess.

2115
01:58:37,501 --> 01:58:40,050
But now when you get out and
you're in the halfway house,

2116
01:58:40,051 --> 01:58:43,390
I want to go down and you have to stay
on and go back to prison. Really? Yeah.

2117
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:46,980
Cause the halfway house that bad. No,
because I don't know what to do it.

2118
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:51,820
So you were institutional. I'm done.
Yeah, I'm cold. I'm cold. This is not,

2119
01:58:51,821 --> 01:58:55,000
that's what they always say cooked.
I don't know what to do or how to do.

2120
01:58:55,001 --> 01:58:58,320
I don't have to walk across the street
and I'm afraid because if I walk across

2121
01:58:58,330 --> 01:58:59,790
it, don't walk. Sign. I'm standing there.

2122
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:01,660
Imagine standing in Brooklyn
in front of it. Don't walk.

2123
01:59:01,661 --> 01:59:06,200
Sign for like five minutes and
there's no fucking cards upstanding.

2124
01:59:06,201 --> 01:59:08,410
They're waiting for the don't walk.
So I had to turn, so the hand,

2125
01:59:08,450 --> 01:59:10,130
they have to handle the
future someone and doing,

2126
01:59:10,190 --> 01:59:13,760
he was doing anything wrong because
they're following me everywhere I go. Why?

2127
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:15,930
I don't want the newspeople
snapping a picture of me walking up,

2128
01:59:15,931 --> 01:59:19,540
girls against the don't walk sign sort
of toast guy comes up to me and says,

2129
01:59:19,541 --> 01:59:24,060
Mike, I looked at him. Yeah, I don't want
acknowledgement, but when do I look like?

2130
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:27,550
He goes, can you just sign
this affidavit for me that you,

2131
01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:30,620
that that this issue that I'm about to
take your picture of? I call them on.

2132
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:32,560
I got to do your fucking job.
Leave me alone.

2133
01:59:32,561 --> 01:59:37,450
Please sign and date because the other
guy just sued the fucking Daily News.

2134
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:41,200
That's hilarious. Hilarious. That's
hilarious. I'm taking a shower.

2135
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:44,720
This is my epic moment.
I first shower and freedom.

2136
01:59:44,721 --> 01:59:49,721
I talk about this often because it's epic
and I'm looking out the window and he

2137
01:59:49,771 --> 01:59:52,010
was my brother's two kids.
I don't know these kids and I've met them.

2138
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:54,810
My mother's side and my
mother's apartment upstairs,

2139
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:56,150
my mother's house upstairs looking out.

2140
01:59:56,151 --> 01:59:58,960
The shower has a window I'm looking at
and I see these two little kids running

2141
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:01,820
across my brother's living next door.
My brother was a cop.

2142
02:00:01,821 --> 02:00:05,000
He retired because of me, but he'd
got a pension. Thank God. Anyway,

2143
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:08,060
that's another story. Play
good hockey player. So that's
where he got his pension.

2144
02:00:08,061 --> 02:00:08,894
Anyway,
so

2145
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:15,230
I see these two kids and uh, I
realized the loss that, you know,

2146
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:19,490
I mean the whole world took place while
I walked that track by myself, you know,

2147
02:00:20,330 --> 02:00:25,330
and my brother who idolized me to no end
now has two kids and I don't even know

2148
02:00:26,301 --> 02:00:30,260
mine. And I'm like, oh my
God, this is fucking horrible.

2149
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:35,710
And now I've got to make a living and the
first thing I want to do is help those

2150
02:00:35,811 --> 02:00:39,890
that I left behind. You
know, yours truly included.

2151
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:43,850
And I'm like,
I don't think I can do this.

2152
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:47,310
And I'm in the fucking shower
crying so hard that I don't know.

2153
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:50,600
I'm getting wet from the
shower or my tears and like,

2154
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:53,170
I don't know if you've ever cried in your
life. I'm a man. I can say it. You know,

2155
02:00:53,450 --> 02:00:56,720
I've never, I don't cry.
Okay. I've wept so hard.

2156
02:00:57,260 --> 02:01:01,880
I wept so hard that I wanted
to take a nap when I was done.

2157
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:05,330
It was just like, I was like, Shit,
just kept pouring out of my body.

2158
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:10,650
The first shower and freedom was like I
was getting all the poison of life now

2159
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:16,640
because you know, you gotta realize
this is at this time of 44 years old,

2160
02:01:16,641 --> 02:01:20,290
I have nothing.
Zero.

2161
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:24,550
My whole life is a fucking
zero at 44 years old.

2162
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:29,560
But you still have kids and I don't
feed anything, but you're out.

2163
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,940
I have nothing. I don't have
kids. Someone else has kids.

2164
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:38,470
I happened to be a guide that
they heard about. I have nothing.

2165
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:40,120
It'd

2166
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:43,810
be easier for me to turn around
and go back. Wow. So do you,

2167
02:01:43,811 --> 02:01:47,510
you really wanted to go back? Of course.
I didn't want to. You didn't want,

2168
02:01:47,511 --> 02:01:52,511
it just seemed like the easiest thing to
do was to go back and thank God at that

2169
02:01:53,291 --> 02:01:58,291
moment I had good parents and solid family
support and couple of young kids that

2170
02:02:02,111 --> 02:02:05,160
wanted to get to know
me. You know? Uh, cause

2171
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:09,520
that's, I don't know what
else to say. I mean it just,

2172
02:02:09,521 --> 02:02:12,010
it was like I didn't know what to do.
I had to do to earn a living.

2173
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:14,320
I never had a fucking job.
And my life, I was a cop.

2174
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:19,120
So what did you do for a job after that?
Because it's gotta be hard to get a job.

2175
02:02:19,150 --> 02:02:20,230
I still can't get a job.

2176
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:23,013
Do you want one?

2177
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:27,770
Well, you got one from me. If I had, when
I give it to you, I just, I'm a good word.

2178
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:30,800
I need a real podcast network.
That's what I need.

2179
02:02:30,801 --> 02:02:33,710
I need to actually have a network.
Yeah. We start, give, give,

2180
02:02:33,711 --> 02:02:36,680
giving guys like you shows.
I couldn't get a fucking job,

2181
02:02:36,870 --> 02:02:39,800
but my brother was doing some construction
and then I get mixed up with the

2182
02:02:39,801 --> 02:02:42,560
construction industry for about four
or five years and I did pretty well.

2183
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:44,180
And that was in the boom time,

2184
02:02:44,181 --> 02:02:47,710
so anybody could hold the brush in
their hand or a hammer in their hand,

2185
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:49,430
got a job and they made a decent salary.

2186
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:53,240
And I turned down some union office
because I had family that runs one of the

2187
02:02:53,241 --> 02:02:56,690
unions on. And I turned it down
because I needed money now.

2188
02:02:56,720 --> 02:03:01,640
I wanted to try to help now. And,
um, so I did what I call it and um,

2189
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:06,260
and uh, you know, listen, I I,

2190
02:03:06,261 --> 02:03:09,980
I put an ankle bracelet on me when I got
home cause I was banging on the chicks

2191
02:03:09,981 --> 02:03:13,670
from the halfway house.
You're not supposed to do that,

2192
02:03:13,671 --> 02:03:16,790
but you're not supposed to
know. Why not? I don't, I don't,

2193
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:20,450
I don't they own you are, you're free.
You're not. No, cause she's a convict too.

2194
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:22,790
So can't associate with convicts.
Right.

2195
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:25,730
But you're sleeping in the
house with them. Right. But
you can't fuck them. Right.

2196
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,340
Can you hug them? No. No.

2197
02:03:28,341 --> 02:03:32,170
Patronize and [inaudible] or
sexualizing any of them. Well,

2198
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:36,110
so it was very difficult. I broke the
rule from the day. So the first rule.

2199
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:39,260
So did you get in trouble for that?
Yes. Breaking that rule. Eventually.

2200
02:03:39,261 --> 02:03:40,490
What do they do?
What do they say?

2201
02:03:40,491 --> 02:03:44,720
I tried to get rid of her because she was
a psycho. I found out, uh, gee, how weird.

2202
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:47,300
Psycho ex con, that doesn't
even make sense. It makes sense.

2203
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:50,100
And I want to talk disparagingly about
the dead by the way. She passed. Oh,

2204
02:03:50,101 --> 02:03:52,400
what happened? Yeah, I think I
don't live or something anyway,

2205
02:03:52,401 --> 02:03:56,090
but hold them horrible death. But,
uh, I had to get away from her,

2206
02:03:56,091 --> 02:03:59,750
so I made the decision to go
back to prison just to get
away from her real. Yeah.

2207
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:02,300
And uh,
she threatened to call and she did,

2208
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:06,350
she called my probation officer and he
came in a put an ankle bracelet on me.

2209
02:04:06,351 --> 02:04:07,370
He spared me prison.

2210
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:10,790
He put an ankle now and then I got you
ended up again with the ankle bracelet on

2211
02:04:10,791 --> 02:04:13,860
because like I said, it was going
to church, but I didn't, uh,

2212
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:19,610
where'd you go? I don't want to put
it out there. Okay. But it wasn't bad.

2213
02:04:19,611 --> 02:04:21,290
It was at someone's house,
you know, it's getting late.

2214
02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:25,210
I understand that because they wouldn't
leave my house. So finally I got out.

2215
02:04:25,211 --> 02:04:28,340
And so you were under house
arrest? Is that what the uh, the,

2216
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:32,000
I could price it does, it keeps you up
within, within a beacon of the machine.

2217
02:04:33,470 --> 02:04:37,710
Yeah. So I was willing to
go back to prison to get rid
of this relationship and,

2218
02:04:37,711 --> 02:04:41,660
um, uh, um, I almost did. Yeah.

2219
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:44,850
Jesus Christ.
So that was my reentry into society.

2220
02:04:44,851 --> 02:04:47,820
So how much time do you have to spend
doing this halfway house thing before

2221
02:04:48,460 --> 02:04:52,110
that's like it. But what it is, you go
from halfway house, the home confinement,

2222
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:55,140
and then after home confinement you
go on to supervise, release home,

2223
02:04:55,141 --> 02:04:59,160
can find it so you can find your home
for during the, during the hours of the,

2224
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,850
like if you're not working for now that
you're locked in your house, you know,

2225
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:04,590
and that's, yeah. Yeah. So they can
call at any minute. And he said,

2226
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,940
you can't go to the movies.

2227
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:09,270
You can ask for permission to go shopping
and things of that nature, you know,

2228
02:05:09,271 --> 02:05:13,410
and then come back in. It's,
you're clocked, you checked
constantly on your toes.

2229
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:16,500
I don't understand that. Like why is
that? If you're afraid, if you're free,

2230
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:19,560
and if you can go to the movies was
you're not free. You're not free.

2231
02:05:19,561 --> 02:05:21,450
You're not free yet.
You're still part of your sentence.

2232
02:05:21,451 --> 02:05:25,410
It was just why I said 12 and a half
years, not 11 years, nine months,

2233
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:29,340
because the last six months of my
prison sentence was in the street. Wow.

2234
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:32,400
And then from there you do five
years of supervised released,

2235
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,690
which is when she called up on me
when I broke up with her, you know,

2236
02:05:36,691 --> 02:05:39,380
and then he was fucking pissed as, I mean,
how could you blame the guy? You know,

2237
02:05:39,381 --> 02:05:40,410
I been trying to him for like two,

2238
02:05:40,411 --> 02:05:43,860
three years now at this point when she
can drop the dime on me. Let's pause.

2239
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:48,990
He says, he says, well, I'm
gonna tell you. He said, what
do you mean? I said, look,

2240
02:05:48,991 --> 02:05:51,950
you're going to tell the judge that
I, I fell in love. Come on. Yeah,

2241
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:54,950
she was the love judge. Judge,
judge, Judge Kimba what?

2242
02:05:54,951 --> 02:05:57,450
The ones who got it was all over the news.
What happened to her?

2243
02:05:58,050 --> 02:06:00,240
I don't know that story. I don't want
to talk bad about judges. You know?

2244
02:06:00,241 --> 02:06:03,090
I may see him again. Well, you don't have
to talk bad. No, she, she got jammed up.

2245
02:06:03,091 --> 02:06:05,660
Whatever relationship she was
wanting and it was all their news.

2246
02:06:05,690 --> 02:06:08,990
They dispatch to understand.
That's what I thought. Nope.

2247
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:12,420
It's not quite as understanding
as you think hypocrites.

2248
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:16,890
How dare they. So then
how do you, what do,

2249
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:20,280
what do you eventually want
up doing for, for work? Um,

2250
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:24,900
so I continue on in the construction
field and um, uh, I can't remember.

2251
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:28,350
No, I can see continue on
in this limousine driving,

2252
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:29,640
I ended up being a limousine driver.

2253
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:33,300
The job that Kenny actually got me fired
from before I went to prison because I

2254
02:06:33,301 --> 02:06:35,070
got the job done the
limousine for one hour,

2255
02:06:35,071 --> 02:06:39,870
but never drove the limo because my lip,
I don't want to tell the story.

2256
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:43,650
I'm about to get a job
driving a limousine. So Kenny
goes, where are you working?

2257
02:06:43,651 --> 02:06:45,150
Where you working?
But he's wearing a wire and go,

2258
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:46,680
I'm just talking to
driving a limo tomorrow.

2259
02:06:46,690 --> 02:06:49,830
I'll have some decent pay all the plants
about leaving the country, you're off.

2260
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:53,640
Well you don't, don't even fucking
really knows the depth of this.

2261
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,870
This is about round bail. So I go look
good. If I got a job down in limbo, I'm,

2262
02:06:58,010 --> 02:07:01,390
you know, six, 800 a week for now.
I had a lot of money coming in,

2263
02:07:01,391 --> 02:07:05,610
in rental incomes. I'm good cause it had
four homes and a condo on the ocean. And

2264
02:07:07,290 --> 02:07:10,870
so he turns around and he
says, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2265
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:15,780
What do you fucking care where? He goes,
well in case I want a job. So I go,

2266
02:07:16,650 --> 02:07:17,610
well I tell him,
I don't know.

2267
02:07:17,611 --> 02:07:20,550
It was in the fucking newspapers
in deer park somewhere. Boom.

2268
02:07:21,570 --> 02:07:25,380
Next day to go to start the job. I'm on
my way. Yeah, I just bought the last $300.

2269
02:07:25,381 --> 02:07:29,130
I bought a suit. Black suit guy
goes, I go, I'm on my way. It's just,

2270
02:07:29,131 --> 02:07:31,320
I haven't heard from you to put the call
me. Tell me what time to be at the shop.

2271
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:36,000
He goes, we've got a problem. I know.
What's the problem? He says, so I got

2272
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:39,610
a visit. I go, what? He
goes, I got to visit.

2273
02:07:39,611 --> 02:07:43,360
They're going to open my books and my
taxes and leave me a new asshole if I give

2274
02:07:43,361 --> 02:07:48,310
you a job here. I said, you gotta
be kidding me, motherfucker.

2275
02:07:48,311 --> 02:07:49,950
I just spent my list 300 cash.

2276
02:07:49,951 --> 02:07:51,490
Cause the government takes
everything when they get you.

2277
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:55,630
So now I can't even get a job fucking
doing a hat while I'm out on bail.

2278
02:07:55,631 --> 02:07:58,360
So I wouldn't have had the Desperado
to leave the fucking country.

2279
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:03,010
So Kenny set that up. I don't
know. Allegedly. Possibly.

2280
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:05,140
Probably. Probably. I'm sure.

2281
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:08,321
Wow.

2282
02:08:08,321 --> 02:08:13,060
So it wasn't just wearing a wire
[inaudible] who is conspiring on going?

2283
02:08:13,061 --> 02:08:15,430
You know what? He fucking walks around.
He's saved someone's life. Yeah,

2284
02:08:15,431 --> 02:08:20,020
you're fucking ruined. Mine probably
saved it in a way to that. I'm not mad.

2285
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:23,960
I just, you know, just, just be, just
this, keep it real. He saved my life and,

2286
02:08:23,961 --> 02:08:27,180
and whatnot. You know what are some
of the cops saved my life, right?

2287
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:31,780
They locked me up. Right. Wow. I couldn't
get a fucking package after that.

2288
02:08:32,050 --> 02:08:35,680
You're sitting on a gold mine though.
You are sitting on a gold mine.

2289
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:40,390
These fucking stories. Oh, it's fucking
ridiculous. If you just write it,

2290
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:44,140
if you can you write, can you
type? I can do a lot of things.

2291
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:48,070
You should shoulder hurts
though. Well, yeah. You keep
doing this. Keep doing this.

2292
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:49,481
What's going on with,

2293
02:08:49,481 --> 02:08:52,780
I got to fucking two pins Stinger and
you're going to pitch two vertebrae.

2294
02:08:53,370 --> 02:08:55,410
What do you call this? Have
you ever, uh, do you know what,

2295
02:08:56,010 --> 02:08:58,510
I'm going to treat prep and treatment
right now. What are they doing for you?

2296
02:08:58,630 --> 02:09:02,800
I'm doing the third physical therapy act.
I've had some serious spinal shit.

2297
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:08,050
Bulging discs and stuff working out. Yeah,
you can, uh, you can get rid of that.

2298
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:10,600
I've got rid of it. A harmless sound
it right now I'm working on it.

2299
02:09:11,230 --> 02:09:13,470
It's a process. You just got
to do it slow. And you know,

2300
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:17,070
spinal decompression is a big thing to
stretching, hanging by her neck and shit.

2301
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:20,770
They have these, um, things that you can
actually set up. They're fairly cheap.

2302
02:09:21,070 --> 02:09:22,480
He just set them up on a door.

2303
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:25,990
They hang off the back of the door
like a little chain. My actually,

2304
02:09:25,991 --> 02:09:28,360
my friend Denny has one that
he likes even better than that.

2305
02:09:28,361 --> 02:09:32,080
It's inflated actually.
And you put it on your neck and he's had,

2306
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:35,960
he's got some spinal issues too
and it actually just lifted.

2307
02:09:36,170 --> 02:09:37,540
It's shade it,

2308
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:42,040
you pump it up and it kind of lifts up
on your neck and stretches because a lot

2309
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:47,041
of it is either injury or bad posture
and everything gets compressed and it

2310
02:09:47,231 --> 02:09:49,420
stays compressed and the distance pop out.

2311
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:52,210
And what you got to do is
relieve some of that compression.

2312
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:56,020
And one of the ways is these, I
have this one, it's like a harness.

2313
02:09:56,021 --> 02:09:59,830
I strap it under my chin, I velcro it
in place, and then I crank on it, click,

2314
02:09:59,831 --> 02:10:01,600
click, pulls my neck, click,

2315
02:10:01,601 --> 02:10:06,340
click pulls my nervous or afraid
that you might overdose him down. No,

2316
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,720
no, no. It's not that.

2317
02:10:07,870 --> 02:10:12,100
It's not listen to change yourself
for a second. You're right.

2318
02:10:12,101 --> 02:10:16,570
But I appreciate the, the uh, medical
advice, you know, because I'm in pain,

2319
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:21,620
but uh, the Mike down.com and
people can get my, um, uh,

2320
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:23,180
they can download the um,

2321
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:26,830
the seven five from my
website and Nafa I might get,

2322
02:10:26,831 --> 02:10:30,110
I might get 25 cents if they do that. So
did you, do you get a cut of that? Okay.

2323
02:10:30,340 --> 02:10:32,410
I had a little something
so it would be nice.

2324
02:10:32,411 --> 02:10:33,950
I'll definitely something to be nice.
I mean,

2325
02:10:33,951 --> 02:10:37,510
I lost my job due to the documentary.
What job was at a,

2326
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:41,030
I was doing mechanical services in,
uh,

2327
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:44,470
in a location that I'm still
in flux with them. Right?

2328
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:47,600
Even when he fucking
describing a legit job,

2329
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:50,930
everything is the problem is you
gotta understand something. Uh,

2330
02:10:50,990 --> 02:10:55,220
I lost the position because of my past.

2331
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:59,350
So if I put their specific location,
I understand I,

2332
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:02,000
and I'm still trying to work
something out with them. Right?

2333
02:11:02,001 --> 02:11:05,210
So they found out about your thing,
knew about it when they hired me,

2334
02:11:05,211 --> 02:11:08,180
but the documentary became
so compelling and riveting,

2335
02:11:08,181 --> 02:11:12,370
so interesting and so detailed that,
you know,

2336
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:13,550
probably some cop called up and said,

2337
02:11:13,551 --> 02:11:17,120
I don't want my wife working with
this guy around and fucking CEO said,

2338
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:21,260
you got to find a way to get
rid of him. Yeah. Well listen,

2339
02:11:21,261 --> 02:11:24,770
they're doing your favor. I swear to God,
you're sitting on a fucking gold mine.

2340
02:11:25,070 --> 02:11:27,080
These stories you have and you have,

2341
02:11:27,081 --> 02:11:30,980
I guarantee you probably have a fucking
thousand of them all your years in the

2342
02:11:30,981 --> 02:11:34,310
job. Easily. 10 years, 10 years, five
months. I didn't the street. Yeah.

2343
02:11:34,311 --> 02:11:39,050
You just need to sit down with somebody
and write these out and then edit them

2344
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:40,940
and make the most compelling ones.

2345
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:44,960
You could probably have a
fucking 500 page book. 500 yeah,

2346
02:11:44,961 --> 02:11:49,410
I'm trying to cut it down, cut it
down. But if you cut it down to d,

2347
02:11:49,460 --> 02:11:51,650
the gems and just,
you know,

2348
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:56,030
honest about all the fucking craziness
and all the weird shit that's going on in

2349
02:11:56,031 --> 02:12:01,031
your head and the family and
Pussy and drugs and God damn,

2350
02:12:01,101 --> 02:12:04,060
it's a gold mine. I'll fucking buy it.
I'll buy it in the God damn heartbeat.

2351
02:12:04,210 --> 02:12:07,850
You know my friend Joey Diaz is
a, a a nut for crime books. He's,

2352
02:12:07,851 --> 02:12:11,300
he's turned me on like a fucking hundred
crime books. He's always like Joe Rogan.

2353
02:12:11,301 --> 02:12:14,630
You gotta read this fucking book
and had the kind of time to read.

2354
02:12:14,631 --> 02:12:19,180
Cause today people don't.
That's good. Once you get on
planes to yeah, planes out,

2355
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:19,821
that's a good time.

2356
02:12:19,821 --> 02:12:23,390
If I just force myself a couple of days
a week to force myself to go to bed,

2357
02:12:23,391 --> 02:12:25,940
where before I go to bed, sit
down and, and that's, you know,

2358
02:12:25,941 --> 02:12:27,370
that's what I used to do in the joint.
I have,

2359
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:29,360
I've had probably four or
500 books while I was away,

2360
02:12:29,361 --> 02:12:31,730
so I tried to expand my vocabulary.
However,

2361
02:12:31,731 --> 02:12:33,590
when you've talked to
welcome police terms,

2362
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:37,280
you vocabulary narrows back to the
vocabulary you use while you're,

2363
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:41,240
while you're doing your job. Yeah.
Like, fuck you, motherfucker.

2364
02:12:41,241 --> 02:12:42,800
Get over you and get that right now.

2365
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:45,470
Let me see your fucking hands and
don't fucking move. Meanwhile,

2366
02:12:45,471 --> 02:12:50,270
I want you to raise your hands. Well,
the, um, audio books are great too.

2367
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:51,473
I love that.

2368
02:12:51,490 --> 02:12:54,560
Cause I'm always stuck in traffic and
especially I do like to sit costs so far.

2369
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:57,760
Very good. Very good. Not Bad,
right? I put it down after. Yeah, no,

2370
02:12:58,090 --> 02:13:01,790
we're talking about, you know, it's
hard. It's pretty bit lit. It's rude. No,

2371
02:13:01,791 --> 02:13:04,930
it was great. Yeah, it was good though.
It's good. It's good. It's very solid to,

2372
02:13:04,990 --> 02:13:09,030
yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's funny that
it's got that guy's fucking face brown.

2373
02:13:09,050 --> 02:13:11,810
Everything actually has,
if the details really,

2374
02:13:11,811 --> 02:13:14,810
really cool cause it has the
street in there, you don't see it.

2375
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:19,310
It has the location of his drug spot in
the fucking band on this is like when

2376
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:22,220
you buy these, well we're working
on right now. We'll put it together.

2377
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:26,930
You know there's a big tobacco letter
they call it in in Dominican Republic who

2378
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:29,540
saw the documentary.
Oh that's hilarious.

2379
02:13:29,870 --> 02:13:33,900
And Adam didn't know, I said, Adam, do
you have a relationship with this company?

2380
02:13:33,901 --> 02:13:36,540
He says, yeah. I said, well go
tell him what the fuck you are.

2381
02:13:36,690 --> 02:13:40,900
So he went and saw them and they
showed a documentary and they,

2382
02:13:40,950 --> 02:13:44,280
I think they listened to Audi's podcast
with me or something and he went,

2383
02:13:44,281 --> 02:13:46,950
Holy Fuck yes,
we got to Ciga for you.

2384
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:49,380
So I put his face on this fucking cigar.

2385
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:53,490
I think when we get mine to say
the seven five on it, doubt maybe,

2386
02:13:53,491 --> 02:13:57,090
you know that's not bad. So you can
even just Dowd, well doubts cigars.

2387
02:13:57,270 --> 02:14:01,600
Now this Guy Adam, is he stuck
in, he can't come here. Yeah,

2388
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:04,350
we can call them if you want to call
them. I mean, he's dying to say hello,

2389
02:14:04,351 --> 02:14:08,940
but you know who really more
interesting. Oh, Walter. Well,
Walter, seem interesting.

2390
02:14:09,090 --> 02:14:13,110
Walt is pretty fucking cool. Can we
do that or no? You don't do this.

2391
02:14:13,111 --> 02:14:14,490
No need to do it now,
but listen,

2392
02:14:14,491 --> 02:14:18,150
this ain't the first podcast you and
aren't going to do. I'm sure we got money.

2393
02:14:18,151 --> 02:14:21,150
More things to talk about
it. As more things come out
and you start doing things,

2394
02:14:21,151 --> 02:14:23,770
I'll be happy to help you
promote on. That'd be nice. Yeah.

2395
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:27,520
When the book comes out, fuck, what
do you think that's gonna. I mean,

2396
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:31,860
if it's in flux right now, you
know, because the thing is,

2397
02:14:32,420 --> 02:14:36,690
uh, we've come to see a
couple of publishers right
now that are a little nervous.

2398
02:14:36,750 --> 02:14:39,910
When the fuck is wrong with
that. Listen, you pussies,

2399
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:46,800
he's done the time. Shut the fuck up
so people can't get behind the ball.

2400
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:51,570
I did bad things. I don't think I'm
that bad of a guy. You know what I mean?

2401
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:55,320
I hope not. Anyway. I've known a lot of
bad guys. I don't think you're a bad guy.

2402
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:59,320
No thank you. Did bad shit. Like I said,
I could've done that same shit. Yeah.

2403
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,980
I think, I think people
being honest, if you're,

2404
02:15:01,981 --> 02:15:06,981
if you're honest about circumstantial
situations that you find yourself into and

2405
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:11,100
poor decision making and being young
and doing drugs and then also being

2406
02:15:11,101 --> 02:15:14,700
involved in a heinous
crime riddled situation,

2407
02:15:14,850 --> 02:15:18,600
like your environment that
you're in, you're going to
these places, these ghettos,

2408
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:22,160
you're constantly around crime. You're
constantly are on drugs. And I got,

2409
02:15:22,161 --> 02:15:25,830
I imagine like as you detailed in the,
in the documentary,

2410
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:31,190
the crime aspect of it slowly
sort of started creeping in.

2411
02:15:31,230 --> 02:15:33,690
It gets you, and that was Jill.
I was young and impressionable.

2412
02:15:33,780 --> 02:15:37,770
You know when you see a 17 year old kid
in a Jaguar with a gooseneck fucking

2413
02:15:37,771 --> 02:15:42,020
equalizer, like he's the, he's the
bomb, right? And he's got, you know,

2414
02:15:42,050 --> 02:15:46,890
25 $30,000 in his pocket and he's got
ropes and diamonds hanging on his neck.

2415
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:51,870
I'm like, what the fuck? What am I
doing here? Right? Listen, it's wrong.

2416
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:53,940
Do you remember seeing that wrong?

2417
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:57,750
Sometimes you remember the first piece
of crime that you did while you were a

2418
02:15:57,751 --> 02:16:02,530
cop? Like you never forget your
first pussy pussy like I like,

2419
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:05,790
like it's an object first
woman. Excuse me. Pardon me?

2420
02:16:05,791 --> 02:16:10,750
People perse woman that you've had
sexual relations with. Not with that.

2421
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:14,700
Who's that? Not with that. Monica.

2422
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:20,460
Monica Lewinsky sex really, really did
one of these things with the thumb.

2423
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:25,350
I did not as finger bent.
It's something fucker.

2424
02:16:26,090 --> 02:16:30,150
He had his cigars and everything
and one of these we should have.

2425
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:35,720
Yeah. Well that's another story
of a rat, right? Not even her.

2426
02:16:35,740 --> 02:16:39,450
The other check. Doggedly won. Then
remember the whole story one? Yeah.

2427
02:16:39,451 --> 02:16:43,550
You just got a blonde. No, Monica Lewinsky
was friends with some old hag. Yeah,

2428
02:16:43,551 --> 02:16:47,230
the blonde that ratted him
out. Yeah. Yeah. It was a
blonde was a different one. Oh,

2429
02:16:47,231 --> 02:16:49,690
that Clem was on a
ramp. Yeah, he did good.

2430
02:16:49,691 --> 02:16:52,510
The last great American Dick's
Lincoln present. Yeah. Yeah.

2431
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:54,460
Because now you're not allowed.
You're not allowed anymore.

2432
02:16:54,490 --> 02:16:56,320
We lost what it meant to be.

2433
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:59,230
Do you think Schwag laughing
at these fucking idiots.

2434
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:03,880
I don't want to get into that
touching. Haha. Checkmate.

2435
02:17:04,390 --> 02:17:06,850
He gets head and then shoots the hooker
and throws her off the top of the

2436
02:17:06,851 --> 02:17:11,820
Kremlin. Lao witness, he
doesn't even know. They don't,

2437
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:14,200
it doesn't matter if it's a witness,
doesn't matter.

2438
02:17:14,201 --> 02:17:15,490
It just doesn't even have to shoot.

2439
02:17:15,491 --> 02:17:17,620
They got nuclear poisoning
drops for these people.

2440
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:20,170
All they have all kinds of things.
But do you remember,

2441
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:25,020
do you remember like the
first crime loud often?

2442
02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:27,730
What is, because listen, when
you, when you were a comp,

2443
02:17:27,731 --> 02:17:30,100
if you're not doing what you're
supposed to do by the book,

2444
02:17:30,101 --> 02:17:32,410
you're on the edge of
committing crime every fucking,

2445
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:35,960
every time you even let somebody off
when they're supposed to be arrested,

2446
02:17:35,961 --> 02:17:38,160
you basically, you've committed
a crime, you know, cause you,

2447
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:41,260
you've used this to discretion in an
area where there was no discretion,

2448
02:17:41,650 --> 02:17:44,240
you know, so, you know, so, so, but the,

2449
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:46,950
but the thing I talk about is when they
took the money from the Hispanic kid,

2450
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:50,380
the Puerto Rican kid, uh, in, in,
in the movie, I talk about it. Yeah.

2451
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:52,050
What was that situation?
Well,

2452
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:56,830
he had what we called the Puerto Rican
mystery at the time. I didn't listen.

2453
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:59,020
I Love Puerto Rico's. They're my
favorite people in the word fun thing.

2454
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:00,880
That's the best, you
know, they got the Remy,

2455
02:18:00,881 --> 02:18:03,460
they got everything going on in
the Bodegas. I loved them. They,

2456
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,320
they helped me grow up.
I love it.

2457
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:07,660
They're very flavor with me
at the same time oriented.

2458
02:18:07,661 --> 02:18:09,250
They love them and they
ruined me at the same time.

2459
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:13,170
So what happened was this is
vet driving down and together,

2460
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:15,430
when you see a vet in the ghetto, you're
going to notice it, right? I mean,

2461
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:19,390
look at me. Yeah, I put it little
Ted spotless. I gotta be noticed.

2462
02:18:19,690 --> 02:18:23,290
But so this kid's got this vet and I
pulled him over and he's got nothing.

2463
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:27,710
I mean, nothing, no license
plates, no insurance. I mean,

2464
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:31,660
I'll plates on the fucking car driving it.
So,

2465
02:18:31,661 --> 02:18:35,590
but I noticed he had a thick wad of
hundreds in his fanny pack back then.

2466
02:18:35,591 --> 02:18:40,400
You know, I still wearing one or you
say back then, see that Bruce Beck,

2467
02:18:40,510 --> 02:18:43,690
he goes,
his dual all you got the whole thing.

2468
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:48,340
I started wearing one again not too
long ago where one, I don't give a fuck.

2469
02:18:48,341 --> 02:18:52,820
I'm married, I'm not trying any pussy.
Yeah, you don't need to get laid for you.

2470
02:18:52,830 --> 02:18:56,560
I'll come, man. If I was trying to get
lit, hey girl, go get yourself a Trump.

2471
02:18:56,561 --> 02:18:58,990
Fuck you with a fanny pack.
Wanna fuck fucker.

2472
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:03,880
That's what you and I have to dress
up for you the fuck Outta here.

2473
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:07,900
Well your wife, Oh no, don't do anything.

2474
02:19:08,260 --> 02:19:12,310
Don't do the color headache. I get
headaches. I wouldn't want to do it.

2475
02:19:12,311 --> 02:19:17,200
So I pull a guy I respect. I pulled the
guy over and he goes, um, this is my,

2476
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:20,550
I got nothing but he's got his benjamins
and Franklins and his fucking bay.

2477
02:19:20,870 --> 02:19:23,890
Right. So I just tried that he
could buy us nice lobster lunch.

2478
02:19:23,891 --> 02:19:27,800
Cause you know everybody eats
lobster for lunch, right? So he says,

2479
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:33,110
I said, so you know, lobster lunch
kid, you know, he goes, yeah, yeah,

2480
02:19:33,350 --> 02:19:37,550
yeah. I said, and leave it on the back
seat. Now what you're handing me nothing.

2481
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:41,060
Right, right, right. I don't want
someone to see it. First thing.

2482
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:42,500
That's the first thing. So he, right.

2483
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:45,070
So he leaves it a couple of
bucks on the fucking backseat.

2484
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:48,680
I Dunno if it was a hundred or 200 or
there's no backseat in a corvette here.

2485
02:19:48,681 --> 02:19:52,280
But this was the backseat of
the police car that I had it.
Oh, I see. Yeah. Okay. So,

2486
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:57,520
oh he was in the car. He was like under,
under arrest basically in the car.

2487
02:19:57,730 --> 02:19:59,740
And so he just takes a couple
of hundreds of his pocket,

2488
02:19:59,810 --> 02:20:03,650
leaves it on the fucking seat.
Okay. Okay. You have a nice day.

2489
02:20:03,651 --> 02:20:06,350
I don't ever want to see you again.
You hit me. That's I'm down parent.

2490
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:08,990
I'm scared to death. How long had
you been on the job at this point?

2491
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:11,870
Not Two years. Year and a half. Wow.

2492
02:20:12,050 --> 02:20:14,900
So for year and a half I
was good as a big straight

2493
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:20,600
out of me. But that doesn't
really count as a year in the,

2494
02:20:20,601 --> 02:20:24,470
in the training you're in training and
so now in East New York and I see money.

2495
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:27,620
Wow. So it's really only a
couple of months on the job.

2496
02:20:28,250 --> 02:20:32,850
A couple of months free. Free actually
under your own discretion back there.

2497
02:20:32,870 --> 02:20:35,720
Cause you gotta realize short quite a bit.
Go on in my training now.

2498
02:20:35,721 --> 02:20:39,090
What did you see in your trainer? Well,
I was confronted with a, under this,

2499
02:20:39,150 --> 02:20:41,930
this is an odd story. I was confronted
with training officers, but I,

2500
02:20:41,970 --> 02:20:43,160
by the time I get to train,

2501
02:20:43,190 --> 02:20:47,540
they had 3,600 cops graduate
the academy the same day. Okay.

2502
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:48,650
Not just think about that.

2503
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:51,320
That's the size of the six largest
police department in the country,

2504
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:55,670
and now we hit the street like a bunch
of fucking cockroaches going everywhere.

2505
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:58,640
Right. And we don't know what
the fuck we're doing. This list.

2506
02:20:58,641 --> 02:21:00,770
They had comp knows what he's doing
when he goes, hey kid. And he's nothing.

2507
02:21:00,830 --> 02:21:02,660
He has no clue. Okay. Well he knows.

2508
02:21:02,661 --> 02:21:05,030
It's like an accountant who
graduated county school and says,

2509
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:07,820
go check this guy's books.
Oh my God.

2510
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:10,970
You know what the fuck you're doing
actually doing it in practice,

2511
02:21:10,971 --> 02:21:14,190
how you're doing it. Right. Okay.
One of the first things happened me,

2512
02:21:14,191 --> 02:21:18,740
I walked out of the Madison Square Garden.
It was graduation day. My father's Dad,

2513
02:21:18,770 --> 02:21:21,140
I'm father retired fireman.
He's standing there with me,

2514
02:21:21,141 --> 02:21:24,680
but walking down the street and I'm
wearing the dress blues and sharp looking

2515
02:21:25,010 --> 02:21:29,750
pretty young, haven't shaved yet. And,
and uh, some woman comes walking up to me,

2516
02:21:29,751 --> 02:21:33,320
officer, officer, and I'm looking
like this, where's the fucking office?

2517
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:38,540
I follow us. That's you. Wow. Yes ma'am.

2518
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:42,500
Yes ma'am. She goes, do you know where
the Empire State building is? So I go,

2519
02:21:42,810 --> 02:21:44,540
I'm trying to find the
empire state building.

2520
02:21:44,690 --> 02:21:48,110
It's all my 34th Street in Manhattan
is the Empire State Building,

2521
02:21:48,590 --> 02:21:52,370
34th Street in Manhattan, Fifth Avenue.
It's two blocks straight in front of me.

2522
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:55,250
Right? So I go, I'm looking around,
I go, I'm going to the standard,

2523
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:59,690
go down two blocks, make a left, right.
Make a left. And so you tell people,

2524
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:04,730
so my father goes, Mike is straight
ahead. I know what guy. Oh yeah,

2525
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:06,920
go straight ahead up there. It's, you're
on your right and then you look up,

2526
02:22:06,921 --> 02:22:07,251
you see it,

2527
02:22:07,251 --> 02:22:09,860
you see this spire at the top of the
empire state building right there.

2528
02:22:09,861 --> 02:22:13,260
So anyway, that was my first day, you
know, being a cop. I didn't know I was,

2529
02:22:14,060 --> 02:22:17,150
I actually have one now. Right now
you're actually like, I'm one now.

2530
02:22:17,151 --> 02:22:21,590
I realize the magnitude is uniform. He
got on people come to you. Right? Oh Shit.

2531
02:22:22,190 --> 02:22:26,140
Serious. What did you see in the
[inaudible] training and training

2532
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:27,960
with PSD Academy Academy?
Right. A bunch of shit.

2533
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:32,890
So in training now I did six
months in the street by myself.

2534
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:36,550
No one wants to cause Christa
training the other rookies.

2535
02:22:36,551 --> 02:22:38,640
First I was in the
second tier of training.

2536
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:41,140
So now I'm learning the
street a little bit, you know,

2537
02:22:41,141 --> 02:22:42,870
and learn how to get a
donut. Yeah, whatever.

2538
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:47,040
I got to get it done.
Not

2539
02:22:49,210 --> 02:22:52,160
Cause they give cops free food.
Right. Most places they did.

2540
02:22:52,650 --> 02:22:56,820
Legitimate establishment establishment
is, yeah, but sometimes some places do.

2541
02:22:56,821 --> 02:22:59,520
Some places didn't back then. And if they
do, if they didn't, you didn't go back.

2542
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:03,750
So I thought everybody did. Well you
would think it's not a crime, but it is.

2543
02:23:03,751 --> 02:23:07,950
So you kicked her crying to fucking crime.
Why? Yeah, so that's what I'm saying.

2544
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:12,550
So that's what I'm saying. Wait a
minute, wait a minute. It's a crime.

2545
02:23:12,590 --> 02:23:17,010
A fucking car. Free meal.
It's a crime that's wrong,

2546
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:20,250
that's wrong. But it's fun. You
can give you a construction worker,

2547
02:23:20,260 --> 02:23:23,510
a free fucking meal. What about firemen
can give a fireman for same, same,

2548
02:23:23,511 --> 02:23:27,020
same thing. That's a crime, correct.
Right. Whoa. But they cook for themselves.

2549
02:23:27,021 --> 02:23:28,710
Nice Dick. They cook a
nice meal. And if I ask,

2550
02:23:28,711 --> 02:23:32,660
what should I end up going to them
quite a bit. But anyway, so, so now,

2551
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:34,830
uh,
I'm committing crimes now.

2552
02:23:34,850 --> 02:23:38,470
W where now you were wandering
around trying to get donuts, right?

2553
02:23:38,471 --> 02:23:40,750
I'm getting donuts and
uh, that's it. You know,

2554
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:42,810
and I'm like running
till like radio calls.

2555
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:45,370
You get to see like cops running
in uniform that, you know,

2556
02:23:45,371 --> 02:23:48,550
it's like a little silly because you're
walking the beat because you're walking

2557
02:23:48,551 --> 02:23:52,270
the beat, you know, put your rookie, uh,
10 54, which is an 80 case, you know,

2558
02:23:52,271 --> 02:23:55,810
someone's got, you know, uh, a hernia,
whatever. In a way it location,

2559
02:23:55,811 --> 02:23:57,400
you don't know what the fuck it
is. You know, you start running,

2560
02:23:57,870 --> 02:23:59,060
you know you've full blocks later,

2561
02:23:59,061 --> 02:24:01,780
you see the patrol car sitting
there and they're like, kid,

2562
02:24:01,990 --> 02:24:05,300
you don't fucking run to
these things. That's what I
think a patrol cause for. Oh,

2563
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:06,550
okay.
We just wanted to help.

2564
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:11,950
We're standing on Queens Boulevard at
80 mile an hour wind blowing my skirt up

2565
02:24:11,951 --> 02:24:14,720
all day long. I want to see something.
You're waiting to see some action. Right.

2566
02:24:15,250 --> 02:24:19,210
So anyway, this goes on for six months.
So finally my first tour in the car,

2567
02:24:19,211 --> 02:24:21,670
I kept with these two veteran
detectives with 22 years on the job.

2568
02:24:21,671 --> 02:24:25,990
Each and the precinct that I was in
had just finished this scandal in the

2569
02:24:25,991 --> 02:24:28,360
newspaper.
It was called the one 10 sergeants club,

2570
02:24:28,610 --> 02:24:31,360
who my neighbor actually was involved
and he went to jail. But anyway,

2571
02:24:31,510 --> 02:24:35,770
so they get right to the meat of it. So
he says to me, this veteran, he goes,

2572
02:24:35,771 --> 02:24:39,760
you know the last guy, I don't, don't
ask me how this conversation started.

2573
02:24:39,761 --> 02:24:42,520
He goes, the last guy that's
connected with the scandal,

2574
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:48,000
he fell over a railing on the fifth floor
during a Christmas party in the snow.

2575
02:24:49,630 --> 02:24:53,560
And he died. I said, oh,
what do you mean? They go,

2576
02:24:54,280 --> 02:24:55,630
what it does is he was rat.

2577
02:24:56,260 --> 02:25:01,180
He told on the cops and the one 10
precinct and he fell over the top of the

2578
02:25:01,181 --> 02:25:04,080
railing.
I said,

2579
02:25:04,081 --> 02:25:08,010
how do you fall over the top of the
fucking railing? Right? You're being,

2580
02:25:08,370 --> 02:25:12,240
it's a four foot ground brought I in
railing. How you go over the top of it.

2581
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:17,190
Right. He just did. He
just managed to, yeah,

2582
02:25:17,220 --> 02:25:20,760
so he, he, I love the considered
it as suicide or accidental death,

2583
02:25:20,761 --> 02:25:21,720
but it was not a homicide,

2584
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:26,440
so they told me that's what
happens when you turn another cup.

2585
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:31,060
So I said, okay, I'm on the job
now. Little less than a year,

2586
02:25:31,061 --> 02:25:33,660
six months in the academy,
six months chasing people around.

2587
02:25:33,661 --> 02:25:35,080
They didn't know what I was doing,
eating donuts,

2588
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:38,290
and now I'm being told by veteran
cops that that's what happens.

2589
02:25:38,291 --> 02:25:42,190
If you tell a cop that
they murdered people, well,

2590
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:47,410
that things can happen. Right. Mysterious.
You can mysteriously get injured.

2591
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:51,880
It doesn't seem that mysterious.
How old are you now? 48 okay.

2592
02:25:52,550 --> 02:25:55,020
Back then, who was pretty
mysterious then. It was just,

2593
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:57,340
I was scared to ask what
happened to him. Okay, I'm good.

2594
02:25:57,510 --> 02:26:00,910
But I think I put the dots together.
Don't tell on a cop. Right.

2595
02:26:01,210 --> 02:26:03,980
So right away you're like, Oh God,
well this is, that's done this.

2596
02:26:03,981 --> 02:26:07,210
And within a week or two, I see him,
Robin fucking cocaine from spots.

2597
02:26:07,211 --> 02:26:11,530
I wasn't the same guys. Same
crew, not that same. Right.

2598
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:15,130
So you're seeing, right. It wasn't,
it was, it was in corona, Elmhurst,

2599
02:26:15,131 --> 02:26:19,390
Jackson Heights, which is cool to
cocaine capital of New York. Actually,

2600
02:26:19,391 --> 02:26:22,020
the world at the time, it was more
than Miami because it was weird.

2601
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:25,030
We call it a little
Columbia, was Wally, Wally,

2602
02:26:25,031 --> 02:26:28,330
major Colombian cartels with shipping
their cocaine to Jackson heights and

2603
02:26:28,331 --> 02:26:31,210
corona, and it was being shipped out
around the whole metropolitan area.

2604
02:26:31,211 --> 02:26:32,044
From there,

2605
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:36,760
it was huge because they had the
airports then they fucking Kennedy and

2606
02:26:36,870 --> 02:26:38,540
Laguardia, they ran them. You know,

2607
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,990
they ran all the fucking transportation
in and out of those locations.

2608
02:26:41,610 --> 02:26:45,210
So they would get jobs or get people
that would get jobs doing that pilot

2609
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:49,780
baggage checked baggage handlers.
They will fucking like a free fall.

2610
02:26:50,090 --> 02:26:54,580
Wow. So I'm working in
this low profile precinct,

2611
02:26:54,581 --> 02:26:58,600
but that's what really was going
on in that. Right. And um, anyway,

2612
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:01,090
what else was I gonna say?
So you're right away,

2613
02:27:01,091 --> 02:27:03,010
you're seeing what's going on right away.

2614
02:27:03,090 --> 02:27:06,790
Right away you're being indoctrinated
like almost instantaneously seeing a lot

2615
02:27:06,791 --> 02:27:08,440
of things that don't add up.
Right.

2616
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:12,970
And now I leave there and I go
to the ghetto and I'm like, okay,

2617
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:16,840
I really should've stayed in fucking
school cause this doesn't look right.

2618
02:27:17,230 --> 02:27:21,670
I got tears in my eyes.
I got Elvis in the ghetto playing on my,

2619
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:24,360
God strike me dead.
I'm driving down Sutter Avenue.

2620
02:27:24,361 --> 02:27:27,370
I've just got graduated from
fucking Queens to East New York.

2621
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:29,260
And that comes in the ghetto.

2622
02:27:29,310 --> 02:27:34,150
It was the song in the ghetto and the
young and Amala cries and I got fucking

2623
02:27:34,151 --> 02:27:35,860
tears in my eyes.
Oh my God,

2624
02:27:35,861 --> 02:27:39,340
they should have stayed in school and
you're just hating the, your choice.

2625
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:41,650
You're just stuck. Scad, scared.

2626
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:46,300
How long was it for you first saw your
first dead body? I had already seen that,

2627
02:27:46,330 --> 02:27:48,710
but because that guy actually
fell from a roof. Well,

2628
02:27:48,711 --> 02:27:50,910
you saw the guy and plenty
of dead bodies by that point.

2629
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:52,180
Probably half a dozen at that point.

2630
02:27:52,181 --> 02:27:55,060
But so you actually saw the guy
who fell from the roof? No, no, no.

2631
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:58,060
I saw a guy that fell from a roof
though. I know what happened. Oh yeah.

2632
02:27:58,061 --> 02:28:02,650
Head gets egg shaped. Um, yeah,
so he's committed suicide.
But anyway, that was my,

2633
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:03,580
one of my first deal ways.

2634
02:28:03,850 --> 02:28:07,870
But so now you're in the ghetto and
you're there and you're scared and you're

2635
02:28:07,871 --> 02:28:11,120
saying I ain't got to sink or
swim. You know, it's, it's, it's,

2636
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:15,130
it's time dd in the sink or you got
to swim. And I had a choice to make,

2637
02:28:15,131 --> 02:28:20,090
so I learned to swim quick and uh, I
was probably in the precinct, you know,

2638
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:25,160
a day I saw my first murder and
then, but my dad, yeah, but I wasn't,

2639
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:27,170
it wasn't my case,
so I really didn't handle it.

2640
02:28:27,171 --> 02:28:30,440
A couple of stabbings and then my
first midnight shift, Jesus gets shot.

2641
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:34,730
Jesus gets shot. My first midnight shift.
Jesus. Hey Suze, what happened to him?

2642
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:38,960
The story goes like this. I'm
working with my buddy sal. Nice guy.

2643
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:42,260
He's a little older than me, the moment.
Sure. He really ready for this action.

2644
02:28:42,261 --> 02:28:45,560
Please. Not An active guy.
So he just wants to, he wants
to do a shift and go home.

2645
02:28:45,830 --> 02:28:48,410
Great. But I'm not. I'm like, I
want to be a cop on to police work.

2646
02:28:49,370 --> 02:28:52,610
Two guys work with a crowbar down the
street or a tire iron down the street.

2647
02:28:53,060 --> 02:28:56,240
It's one, one o'clock at one, two
o'clock in the morning. I'm like, Sal,

2648
02:28:56,270 --> 02:29:00,020
that looks a little suspicious because
it was one. I got the fucking guy.

2649
02:29:00,021 --> 02:29:04,070
He's got a tire iron in his hand. A little
suspicious. What do you think, Mike?

2650
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:07,440
Do you really want to get involved?
I don't know.

2651
02:29:07,441 --> 02:29:08,370
That's what you were supposed to do.

2652
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:10,760
Are the police supposed to
ask some questions? I mean,
the guy's got a tire on.

2653
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:13,580
It's two in the morning.
What do you think? All right,

2654
02:29:13,581 --> 02:29:18,040
so I'd make a u turn go the wrong way on
Fulton Street, right by Cleveland. Uh,

2655
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:21,110
one of those streets.
Cleveland, Fulton and

2656
02:29:23,970 --> 02:29:26,470
W. We're going back to check
up on these guys that we just,

2657
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:29,530
we drove past and now we're going back
and all of a sudden we pull up in this

2658
02:29:29,531 --> 02:29:32,590
fucking scene in the middle of the
street guy, he's got a hole in his head.

2659
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:35,140
He's laying on the ground,
obviously debt already.

2660
02:29:35,710 --> 02:29:40,600
And I see a tire iron sitting
right here like this, right?

2661
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:43,990
But he's here in Tyrion's
over here about 15 feet away.

2662
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:50,560
And I go, what happened? They
go, these two guys, I said,

2663
02:29:50,980 --> 02:29:53,890
the tire. And they go, yeah,
the Tyrion's right there.

2664
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:57,580
It was them with the tire iron. They
ran. So they shot this kid, Jesus.

2665
02:29:57,700 --> 02:29:59,650
He probably went out and
confronted them and said,

2666
02:29:59,651 --> 02:30:04,330
what are you guys doing in
the neighborhood with a, with
a tire iron, uh, you know,

2667
02:30:04,900 --> 02:30:07,480
stealing because stealing cars and
tires and hubs, whatever they could get.

2668
02:30:08,290 --> 02:30:12,610
So he confronted them, they shot and
killed him and they took off in the wind.

2669
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:17,550
So I go to sal, I go, you know what?
Nothing. Nothing. I'm glad you did.

2670
02:30:17,830 --> 02:30:21,130
I'm glad we didn't stop them first,
but Jesus did.

2671
02:30:21,250 --> 02:30:24,340
So that was my first actual shooting
that I was the, what they call it,

2672
02:30:24,370 --> 02:30:26,140
the first responding
officer on the scene up.

2673
02:30:26,410 --> 02:30:28,000
I was there about probably
a week and a half.

2674
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:31,720
So I see my first murder at a week and
a half, and this is before the crack.

2675
02:30:32,740 --> 02:30:36,400
This is before the crack. So this is
just trade. This is straight violence,

2676
02:30:36,401 --> 02:30:40,390
violence, poverty. Get a home,
let's, let's just kill this guy.

2677
02:30:40,391 --> 02:30:42,040
Because he confronted me.
What's crazy?

2678
02:30:42,041 --> 02:30:44,860
The idea that the poverty in
the ghetto was already fucked.

2679
02:30:44,910 --> 02:30:48,160
The amazing thing was that it probably
could have been us or they would have

2680
02:30:48,161 --> 02:30:52,090
rent and most people try not to shoot
it out with the police right now.

2681
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:54,630
Just put a right and then
I wouldn't have those.

2682
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:59,680
We'll have shit to talk about
or more want it to or who knows.

2683
02:31:00,190 --> 02:31:00,930
Yeah.

2684
02:31:00,930 --> 02:31:05,830
She's amazing that the crack came along
and accelerated what was already fucked

2685
02:31:05,831 --> 02:31:09,430
up. Yeah. You know, I don't
know what to say. It was just,

2686
02:31:11,350 --> 02:31:12,010
it was amazing.

2687
02:31:12,010 --> 02:31:15,020
I'll tell you the one thing that was
interesting that during the correct thing,

2688
02:31:15,021 --> 02:31:19,650
when, when he took the cocaine from
the Panamanian government, um, in, uh,

2689
02:31:22,050 --> 02:31:25,920
Dionne kind of meaning army was involved
in bringing a lot of cocaine with

2690
02:31:25,921 --> 02:31:29,940
Noriega through the,
into our country. So w

2691
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,800
back then it was the Kangol hats familiar
with the case, never the Cadillac. Well,

2692
02:31:34,801 --> 02:31:36,840
the Kangol hats,
they were getting robbed from people.

2693
02:31:36,841 --> 02:31:38,900
So this one kid stealing Kango,

2694
02:31:39,030 --> 02:31:41,700
they fucking killing each
other for the triple fat goose.

2695
02:31:42,510 --> 02:31:43,590
The triple fact goes tonight.

2696
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:48,560
He is, and, and, and, and, and the Kangol
hats. So this kid robs has guy friends.

2697
02:31:48,570 --> 02:31:51,640
Kangle had someone calls nine
one one on robbery, suspect boot.

2698
02:31:51,641 --> 02:31:53,530
But boy he runs into a home over on,

2699
02:31:53,650 --> 02:31:56,190
I think it was being sick one and one
of those streets up there bite off

2700
02:31:56,191 --> 02:32:00,140
Atlantic Avenue and he
had a bit up on the guy.

2701
02:32:00,230 --> 02:32:03,380
The kid came off the subway when the kid
standing there waiting from stolen can

2702
02:32:03,381 --> 02:32:05,310
go at gunpoint and ran into his own home.

2703
02:32:05,340 --> 02:32:08,100
So we knocked on the door where the kid
lives, he won't open the fucking door.

2704
02:32:08,101 --> 02:32:10,470
That keeps up.
I had opened the door for you.

2705
02:32:11,730 --> 02:32:16,200
So he goes back upstairs and hides
the kid and it was a two family home.

2706
02:32:16,201 --> 02:32:19,320
The people downstairs open the door
to a common hallway cause they see the

2707
02:32:19,321 --> 02:32:21,180
police. They don't want to fucking
know. They didn't do nothing wrong.

2708
02:32:21,210 --> 02:32:24,240
They opened the door. Let me go
upstairs. Place has the shoes,

2709
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:27,450
the fucking beads separate in
each room. You, you see the beads,

2710
02:32:27,451 --> 02:32:30,810
it's separate the rooms. Some people make
noise when it goes through the room. No,

2711
02:32:30,811 --> 02:32:33,090
it's sort of like, you're supposed to
know that this is two different rooms,

2712
02:32:33,091 --> 02:32:36,840
but they hang the beads. Oh yeah. That's
like, this is a door. But it's really not.

2713
02:32:36,900 --> 02:32:40,230
You know, you can see through there
pretty good. So this is how it was.

2714
02:32:40,231 --> 02:32:41,520
That's the given. Her
getaway is, you know,

2715
02:32:41,521 --> 02:32:45,040
just all the hang a curtain
to different rooms. Um,

2716
02:32:45,870 --> 02:32:47,110
so we get inside new seal,

2717
02:32:47,130 --> 02:32:49,470
the shoes and all the money that's spent
in this place, it's something's up.

2718
02:32:49,770 --> 02:32:53,850
So we grabbed the kid. The kid downstairs
says that's him. We can't find a gun.

2719
02:32:54,030 --> 02:32:55,770
So we ended up going
downstairs in the basement.

2720
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:58,170
That's when you see me in
the movie talking about the
study where we found this

2721
02:32:58,171 --> 02:33:02,370
fucking call, the suitcase,
a wooden suitcase.

2722
02:33:02,371 --> 02:33:03,270
It was fucking like,

2723
02:33:04,690 --> 02:33:06,030
it's like two inch pie almost.

2724
02:33:06,031 --> 02:33:08,820
That's how thick the suitcase was wrapped
in leather. I couldn't get it open.

2725
02:33:08,821 --> 02:33:11,100
I'm like, I'm pretty fucking
strong guy. I couldn't get it up.

2726
02:33:11,101 --> 02:33:13,170
I'm trying to rip this thing open.
I don't have the combination.

2727
02:33:13,230 --> 02:33:15,600
There's no one standing there with
the gate. So finally one of my,

2728
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:19,380
my partner comes up with a hacksaw and
I started hacks or in this fucking thing

2729
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:23,730
open. What am I worried about? What about
the police? There's police all around.

2730
02:33:23,731 --> 02:33:24,780
This is an armed robbery suspect.

2731
02:33:24,781 --> 02:33:28,050
So there's a half a dozen cops Millen in
and out of the place. I killed my buddy,

2732
02:33:28,250 --> 02:33:30,660
watch the watch the staircase
because it was down in the basement.

2733
02:33:30,661 --> 02:33:35,020
Now I cut this thing open the fucking
door. When you finally get it open,

2734
02:33:35,140 --> 02:33:38,180
diploma fucking cocaine comes flying out
and smells like that. Bubblegum Shit.

2735
02:33:38,181 --> 02:33:41,520
The delicious. So I'm like,
Holy Shit, we hit pay dirt.

2736
02:33:42,280 --> 02:33:45,960
I'm trying to get the shootout
out and he goes, my palm, it was,

2737
02:33:46,050 --> 02:33:50,190
they come and they come in like who?
He goes, the owner. I go, fuck it.

2738
02:33:50,330 --> 02:33:54,870
Never mind the police. The owner of the
coke is coming. What do we do? Well,

2739
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:58,830
we can't lock them up with steel at
his coke and now it's like the worst,

2740
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,620
the worst position to be in. And I
find out, I'm walking out my, I'm like,

2741
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:04,350
I put 50 12 pounds on, I'm trying
to get the coke out of his house.

2742
02:34:04,770 --> 02:34:09,480
And he's looking at me like
I stole something from him.
I feel guilty and I go,

2743
02:34:09,481 --> 02:34:12,450
set your stuff. He goes, no, no,
not mine. I go, okay, see you later.

2744
02:34:14,690 --> 02:34:18,220
So I got to patrol call, we go to
the Bodega, we wait on a fucking

2745
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:21,340
scale. How much? It was like a pound
and a half, something like that.

2746
02:34:21,341 --> 02:34:24,430
It wasn't all that. Half of cocaine is a
lot of money, right? Well at that point,

2747
02:34:24,431 --> 02:34:28,720
yeah, it was. It was like we got
28,040 we have 28,000 for it,

2748
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:31,750
so I bought a condo with them.
That's when I bought the condo.

2749
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:38,310
At least you are investing.
That's actually smart.
Yeah, very smart. A lot of,

2750
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:40,300
I mean when you said you
had four houses in a condom,

2751
02:34:40,301 --> 02:34:43,450
like that's actually for
a guy doing blow Robin.

2752
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:46,510
I wasn't Duplo at this time
at the time just selling it,

2753
02:34:46,570 --> 02:34:51,330
but no one would on it. And then, yeah,
I mean you were selling it, texting.

2754
02:34:51,331 --> 02:34:54,220
You're technically right tech. Any
time you transfer cocaine, by the way,

2755
02:34:54,550 --> 02:34:57,800
if you give me a half of April right now,
you've sold it really for it.

2756
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:01,770
Not just remember that now I know what
about me not, don't get me anything.

2757
02:35:01,930 --> 02:35:04,750
Same thing. When you transfer something,
you don't have to give money for it.

2758
02:35:04,870 --> 02:35:09,620
It's still considered. Wow. 20
tell us Joey d is handles it.

2759
02:35:09,820 --> 02:35:14,220
Hands out fucking pot candies
everywhere he goes. So you,

2760
02:35:14,530 --> 02:35:18,430
this was like one of the first really
big ones that you were involved with.

2761
02:35:18,490 --> 02:35:20,170
This is always an exciting
one to say the least.

2762
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:23,740
I left there and went out and to South
Carolina, bought a condo on the ocean.

2763
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:25,270
So you would kind of like,

2764
02:35:25,930 --> 02:35:29,110
but what happened was I went
back to the location to get more,

2765
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:31,900
cause there was a lot more in there.
But when I got there,

2766
02:35:32,110 --> 02:35:34,420
there was a fucking limousine out front.
I swear to Christ,

2767
02:35:34,630 --> 02:35:36,100
there's a limousine out
front with two guys.

2768
02:35:36,101 --> 02:35:38,950
One stayed on each side with the
full link, trench coats on it.

2769
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:41,950
I like standing there like this
and looking right at us like,

2770
02:35:41,951 --> 02:35:45,360
what are you going to do?
And I went, let's get the
fuck outta here. And I'm not,

2771
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:48,610
this is no, this is no
yoke. I was like, okay,

2772
02:35:48,611 --> 02:35:50,830
I'm the police and I'm scared
to death right now. Got It.

2773
02:35:50,831 --> 02:35:55,450
Go Seeds is Christ and how mine did,
I ended up in the joint with Noriega.

2774
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,990
That's all that you were in the same
place as Noriega. Did you see him? No,

2775
02:35:59,110 --> 02:36:03,370
he was in a, um, they give him his own
house because he's still alive. I think.

2776
02:36:03,371 --> 02:36:06,970
So the game is on the house? Yeah,
he had, he's like this little little,

2777
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:10,610
they get in a little warehouse, a little
something going on with him, homey.

2778
02:36:10,670 --> 02:36:13,550
No him. There's the government have
all something going on with him.

2779
02:36:13,570 --> 02:36:18,550
Like give him some pussy. I
shot my hopes. No stories.

2780
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:22,210
He hasn't said anything as well.
You always hope that, I mean,

2781
02:36:22,211 --> 02:36:25,140
or you always hear that route.
Yeah. Well this is a movie,

2782
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:29,050
the witness protection program.
You get, you get pussy.
Yeah. Yeah. He wasn't in it,

2783
02:36:29,170 --> 02:36:30,370
but I know from guys that were,

2784
02:36:30,380 --> 02:36:33,400
that got kicked out of it and they get
pussy while they're in the program.

2785
02:36:33,550 --> 02:36:35,280
They bring him to [inaudible].
Well,

2786
02:36:35,350 --> 02:36:40,330
they bring in to a hotel to meet their
family. Just for you. Oh, reunion. Oh,

2787
02:36:40,331 --> 02:36:44,170
well that's your family though. But I
mean like Noriega. We're all family.

2788
02:36:44,350 --> 02:36:46,120
They got them in a warehouse somewhere.

2789
02:36:46,210 --> 02:36:48,510
I would imagine he's got his
own little spot and listen,

2790
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:52,270
I'm not sure if you go there and
it's all fucking plush carpet.

2791
02:36:52,300 --> 02:36:56,260
Fucking beautiful TV. The story that
everybody drinks. Wow. You had some bid,

2792
02:36:56,380 --> 02:36:58,510
you know you did.
That's what everybody dreams of.

2793
02:36:58,511 --> 02:37:00,900
It's like that Goodfellas scenario.
It's not seen.

2794
02:37:00,901 --> 02:37:04,520
The movie where the cooking steaks and
slicing and dicing the goal is called

2795
02:37:04,540 --> 02:37:06,610
liquid base plates. Don't kid
yourself. Really? Yeah, absolutely.

2796
02:37:06,611 --> 02:37:10,450
And they mistake you really get steak
in joy and if you know where the right

2797
02:37:10,451 --> 02:37:14,230
people, oh, well what else can you get
when you're in there? Can you get girls?

2798
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:18,770
Yeah. You have to pay the gods, you
know? Really? Yeah, but it's, it's rare,

2799
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:22,370
but it happens. So usually it's the God
you bang and female guides Dara here,

2800
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:25,340
right? That you should state. That
was that I stayed in New York.

2801
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:28,190
The fenced a little more classy. You got
to send money to their private account.

2802
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:31,160
Oh really? Yeah. But you can,

2803
02:37:31,190 --> 02:37:34,200
it all can be how anything can happen
if you have the right number. I mean,

2804
02:37:35,290 --> 02:37:37,700
like what's, what's the, how much you
gotta pay a guard and get some pussy?

2805
02:37:38,270 --> 02:37:40,910
I think the going rate was 500
but I'm not sure. 500 bucks.

2806
02:37:40,911 --> 02:37:43,970
He paid them 500 bucks and you can
get laid. You don't hand it to them.

2807
02:37:43,971 --> 02:37:46,580
You have it. Right. That seems
like it'd be worth just saying,

2808
02:37:48,440 --> 02:37:50,960
I'm going to double that if you have to,
certain amount of time.

2809
02:37:50,961 --> 02:37:54,290
It seems like a really good
deal. Really. Girls, you know,

2810
02:37:54,610 --> 02:37:57,440
they were out in the country,
they weren't like city girls, so,

2811
02:37:57,441 --> 02:38:00,680
but female guards would oftentimes
get mix it up with some person.

2812
02:38:00,750 --> 02:38:02,300
If I had to go back and fucking prison,
okay,

2813
02:38:02,301 --> 02:38:05,030
this is not a good thing for me to say
so well you're not going to go back and

2814
02:38:05,031 --> 02:38:10,010
just say it happened. The government
can find ways, but why would you,

2815
02:38:10,011 --> 02:38:14,750
why would we find we have
ways. Listen, it's not going
to happen. I know. Keep your,

2816
02:38:15,050 --> 02:38:17,240
keep your nose clean, keeping
those clean, you'd be fine.

2817
02:38:17,660 --> 02:38:19,700
But that was what happened
in upstate New York, right?

2818
02:38:19,701 --> 02:38:22,600
Those guys that got out when I had
the girl was supposed to wait for 10

2819
02:38:22,610 --> 02:38:25,880
relationship with one of them. And
it happens. It happens quite often.

2820
02:38:26,420 --> 02:38:29,170
It's a difficult position to be in your
a woman getting attention by men who

2821
02:38:29,450 --> 02:38:31,930
most of them pretty good shape,
you know, all day long like,

2822
02:38:31,931 --> 02:38:33,590
and I've been doing sweet
talk you and you know,

2823
02:38:33,591 --> 02:38:36,650
you have to fight your husband that
day and now you know you're vulnerable.

2824
02:38:36,651 --> 02:38:40,000
Like anything else.
I think Tupac Scott,

2825
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:44,990
a song about that doesn't
mean the vulnerable when I
get free. Yeah, that's uh,

2826
02:38:45,410 --> 02:38:49,390
just hand you a piece of paper they're
going on. He sounds given, you know,

2827
02:38:51,350 --> 02:38:53,090
I don't really know if I
should talk about that.

2828
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:56,960
What I made $38,000 but phone
sex in prison. Did you really?

2829
02:38:57,500 --> 02:39:02,040
Why would you not talk about that? He
said illegal. No, it's just I'm over it.

2830
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:02,960
Wait a minute.

2831
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:06,800
You make phone sex for like calling him
like gay guys would call you up? No, no,

2832
02:39:06,801 --> 02:39:09,680
no, no. They don't call you.
You call out and I don't have,

2833
02:39:09,681 --> 02:39:12,470
I didn't have a hotline in
prison now. I had a, I had a,

2834
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:15,120
I had a following of
people that, you know, so

2835
02:39:16,940 --> 02:39:19,670
I had a woman that sent me books
on dominate trick stuff. You know,

2836
02:39:19,671 --> 02:39:24,000
she wanted me to dominator but master
slave books. The story of all right.

2837
02:39:24,020 --> 02:39:26,610
You know, if you guys, you guys
don't be too old for that, but not,

2838
02:39:26,750 --> 02:39:29,080
not old enough story of all was like
an incredible book about a woman.

2839
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:33,300
I like to be sort of manipulated
and whatnot. And some kind
of ways. And so women,

2840
02:39:33,301 --> 02:39:36,710
this woman sent me, this woman sent me,
there's a bunch of books related to that,

2841
02:39:36,950 --> 02:39:39,440
and then I would have phone sex with
her on the phone. Of course, you know?

2842
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:43,380
And she would give you money.
Yeah. I mean, wow. Yeah.

2843
02:39:43,550 --> 02:39:47,170
So girl pay you for phone sex.
That's pretty God damn day.

2844
02:39:47,171 --> 02:39:50,000
That that's pretty special. Yeah. They
call it, they call it cell phones.

2845
02:39:50,950 --> 02:39:52,250
I was in the sell on the phone,

2846
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:58,490
but back then like that's, that's
pretty rare though, isn't it?

2847
02:39:58,491 --> 02:40:01,070
That like a woman would pay
a guy for that. They like,

2848
02:40:01,180 --> 02:40:04,930
they always say that men who are in jail
for like murder and stuff like that,

2849
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:08,600
a lot of money got love. Send
them. Yeah. I had a lot of bands.

2850
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:12,890
Yeah. Mostly women. People are lonely.

2851
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:16,210
You [inaudible] people only, even
people in the, in the, in the free,

2852
02:40:16,211 --> 02:40:19,170
in the free world, that lonely, they
need tension in affection from anybody.

2853
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:20,520
And you know,

2854
02:40:20,521 --> 02:40:25,521
it wasn't really done in a manipulative
way because I needed attention and

2855
02:40:25,531 --> 02:40:30,531
affection and just so happened that
she wanted me to do this right.

2856
02:40:30,770 --> 02:40:34,110
Right, right. I got good at it. The
gods would fight to get my Chris,

2857
02:40:34,220 --> 02:40:36,990
they would won't be listening because
every conversation in prisons,

2858
02:40:37,290 --> 02:40:39,630
I booked down the compound. They'd
be looking at me like, okay,

2859
02:40:39,631 --> 02:40:42,050
when are you going on tonight?
Yeah. So you would like,

2860
02:40:42,330 --> 02:40:45,180
like going on like it was
a performance like us now.

2861
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:47,990
They couldn't wait till I got
on the phone. I don't know.

2862
02:40:48,010 --> 02:40:49,530
It was sweating on the other end.
I don't know.

2863
02:40:49,590 --> 02:40:51,500
And they were listening to
guards were listening in. Yeah.

2864
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:54,240
That's fucking hilarious.
So they got mad at me.

2865
02:40:54,241 --> 02:40:56,130
They just make me make me
send the money home. You know,

2866
02:40:56,131 --> 02:40:57,840
you got too much money in your account.
You got to send it on.

2867
02:40:58,890 --> 02:41:01,560
The guards would make you send the money
home because you can't have too much

2868
02:41:01,561 --> 02:41:04,440
money in your account while
you're incarcerated because
then you could control

2869
02:41:04,470 --> 02:41:08,700
people in the prison. Uh, well how much
can you keep in your account? And then,

2870
02:41:08,701 --> 02:41:11,440
I don't know, they made I, I had
16,000 in there. They said, well,

2871
02:41:12,320 --> 02:41:16,800
you got to fucking sense of home and
it's saw from this one lady. Yeah.

2872
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:19,920
Did you have other people who were
doing this phone sex? No, she was,

2873
02:41:19,930 --> 02:41:24,030
my copy was the main,
she was the Peggy.

2874
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:26,290
How much did you make her prayer?
I didn't make it.

2875
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:29,250
There was no salary and it wasn't, uh,
she just was sending you donations.

2876
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:33,630
She had an escort business.
She had an escort business.

2877
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:38,430
I didn't want to talk about this.
She had an escort business in Orlando.

2878
02:41:38,431 --> 02:41:41,670
She ends up getting arrested for it while
I'm on the phone with her having sex.

2879
02:41:41,730 --> 02:41:44,880
She gets arrested. Feel like they
broke into her house. Yeah. Oh,

2880
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:49,780
y y y y. Y. So what right.

2881
02:41:49,781 --> 02:41:51,040
Because none of this
shit the rest of people,

2882
02:41:51,060 --> 02:41:54,120
but the fact is that she
ends up going to trial.

2883
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:58,360
She ends up going to trial
and winning. Oh, that's a
great story for her, you know,

2884
02:41:59,070 --> 02:42:03,990
but my fucking donations stopped
cause she was going through hell. Wow.

2885
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:08,730
That's crazy though. It was interesting.
I would say so. Yeah. I would say,

2886
02:42:08,731 --> 02:42:11,760
you know what, it is interesting. You
know, you have a life. We all live a life.

2887
02:42:11,761 --> 02:42:14,820
We all do things. And, um,
as it turns out, you know,

2888
02:42:15,270 --> 02:42:17,490
you can write books and
movies about everybody's life.

2889
02:42:17,490 --> 02:42:21,420
Everybody has listened to me right now.

2890
02:42:21,510 --> 02:42:25,710
Your life is way more fucked
up than most people's lives.

2891
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:28,230
It was interesting,
very interesting.

2892
02:42:28,231 --> 02:42:31,470
But a lot of fucked up things are
interesting. But your, your story,

2893
02:42:31,471 --> 02:42:33,990
I mean like you saying, oh, everybody's
got an interesting, like you write a book,

2894
02:42:33,991 --> 02:42:38,550
but everybody like, no, no.
Listen, you wrote a book
about, you know, Jamie's life,

2895
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:42,030
it'd be boring as fuck New York. He's
got a beautiful boy. He's a great guy.

2896
02:42:42,031 --> 02:42:46,500
Don't get me wrong. I'm just
saying no, no coke, no, no phone,

2897
02:42:46,501 --> 02:42:51,150
sex business, no murders. He's never
seen a dead body. I don't think. No.

2898
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:55,370
See, everybody's got, you know
what I'm saying? Yeah. See you've,

2899
02:42:55,560 --> 02:42:58,620
you've seen some shit.
He just don't think he's seen some shit.

2900
02:42:58,621 --> 02:43:00,600
You know what it is. You take
things for granted, you know, short,

2901
02:43:00,680 --> 02:43:03,960
he lived the life I lived and even though
like I'm lucky to be alive, you know,

2902
02:43:03,961 --> 02:43:07,080
in many ways, um, you just,
you know, like you can,

2903
02:43:07,470 --> 02:43:10,730
we haven't even discussed police work
here because heroin be a bit, well,

2904
02:43:10,731 --> 02:43:12,100
the reason is because to me

2905
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:16,390
it was a normal day. You know, I
handled 28 day jobs, average a day,

2906
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:21,120
so, and then backed up on another
28. So the reality is, you know,

2907
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:24,320
fucked up things I was involved in.
I mean, I don't tell you to store,

2908
02:43:24,321 --> 02:43:26,800
I got to tell you a story, right? You're
going to, I hope you guys enjoy this one.

2909
02:43:26,801 --> 02:43:29,950
This isn't entertaining. I laugh about
it myself and you know what, when I left,

2910
02:43:29,951 --> 02:43:32,200
don't take it the wrong way
because it's just crazy, you know,

2911
02:43:32,201 --> 02:43:36,610
I don't mean to demean anything or anyone.
So I'm getting ready to go to Atlanta,

2912
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:40,500
to The Bahamas. And so
what I do is I do, I do,

2913
02:43:40,980 --> 02:43:43,630
I change my shift from, uh, from um,

2914
02:43:43,750 --> 02:43:47,410
from a four to 12 to a day
shift so that after the,

2915
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:51,940
after the day shift I can go on my merry
vacations instead of set it ending in

2916
02:43:51,941 --> 02:43:55,020
four to 12 at night.
So I get a signed, uh,

2917
02:43:55,420 --> 02:43:59,510
a prisoner in King County Hospital and um,

2918
02:44:00,460 --> 02:44:02,710
she's just so many fucking
stories in my head. It just spins.

2919
02:44:02,860 --> 02:44:06,760
So now you realize I'm going on
vacation at the end of the shift,

2920
02:44:06,850 --> 02:44:09,480
I'm going to The Bahamas when it came
to the islands, I don't know someplace,

2921
02:44:09,520 --> 02:44:13,620
I think The Bahamas, so I don't,

2922
02:44:13,700 --> 02:44:15,720
I have three days growth on my face.
Now you'd get this,

2923
02:44:15,721 --> 02:44:19,050
is this how a cop thinks like a three
days growth on my face because I'm going

2924
02:44:19,051 --> 02:44:21,600
away. You can't have growth on your
face as a cop shows to be clean shaven,

2925
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:24,990
mustache. But you got to be clean
shaven otherwise. So when you turn out,

2926
02:44:25,230 --> 02:44:26,063
you gotta look tight.

2927
02:44:26,610 --> 02:44:30,570
So now I'm in this hospital three days
growth on my face and I'm drunk because I

2928
02:44:30,571 --> 02:44:34,020
just did an all nighter because I did
a four to 12. Instead of going home,

2929
02:44:34,140 --> 02:44:37,410
I stayed at the precinct tap down, you
know, half a dozen or dozen, whatever.

2930
02:44:37,650 --> 02:44:40,020
And uh, and now I'm back at the
hospital guarding this prisoner.

2931
02:44:40,950 --> 02:44:45,090
I walk in the hospital and I take
the handcuffs. I switched to the kid,

2932
02:44:45,091 --> 02:44:49,210
wears a fucking handcuffs. He goes, he's
a rookie. He goes, what do you mean? I go,

2933
02:44:49,970 --> 02:44:52,390
he's a fucking prison. He's
got to be handcuffed. Well,

2934
02:44:52,690 --> 02:44:56,580
he wasn't handcuffed when I got here. And,
uh, I said, I take the handcuffs. I said,

2935
02:44:56,581 --> 02:44:59,250
I have a nice day. I put the cuffs on.
The guy didn't cuff him to his bed.

2936
02:44:59,890 --> 02:45:03,310
She said, what are you doing? I says, for
Christ's sakes, you're a fucking prison.

2937
02:45:03,330 --> 02:45:06,210
I got to sleep.
I got things to do here.

2938
02:45:06,250 --> 02:45:08,820
And I had a sleep catch up cause I'm
going to The Bahamas to them tonight,

2939
02:45:08,821 --> 02:45:12,780
tomorrow. Long Story Short, I'm
trying to shorten it. He goes,

2940
02:45:13,740 --> 02:45:16,350
look, I gotta take a Piss.
That's just the bathroom.

2941
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:21,030
She's waking me up and I was sleeping
already. He wakes me up, so on uncuff him,

2942
02:45:21,270 --> 02:45:25,280
he goes to the bear of my fall back to
sleep. I thought, I bet he's in the back.

2943
02:45:25,380 --> 02:45:29,190
It comes back, wakes me up, I'm back
from the bathroom. I said, okay.

2944
02:45:29,191 --> 02:45:31,170
I got up and he goes, I just woke
you up. What? He put in the fucking,

2945
02:45:31,171 --> 02:45:35,470
he handcuffs on me for so I go, listen.

2946
02:45:36,210 --> 02:45:39,660
Anyway, he goes, I got it
now he now he wants to take
a shower, so I go, all right,

2947
02:45:39,661 --> 02:45:42,750
go take your fucking shower. I'm
sleeping. I said, wake me up.

2948
02:45:42,751 --> 02:45:46,350
When you come back and all
of a sudden about, I dunno,

2949
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:50,310
10 1520 minutes later,
officer, yeah, it's a nurse.

2950
02:45:51,750 --> 02:45:56,550
You're a prisoner has
gone. I go, oh, no, no.

2951
02:45:56,551 --> 02:45:58,560
I didn't shave for three days.
I'm drunk.

2952
02:45:58,860 --> 02:46:01,350
I'm over and I'm going
to Bahamas tomorrow.

2953
02:46:03,170 --> 02:46:04,520
If you make an arrest right now,

2954
02:46:05,030 --> 02:46:07,460
you've got a problem because you've got
a process to the rest of all the way

2955
02:46:07,461 --> 02:46:10,280
through.
I got 17 overtime stood up in front of me.

2956
02:46:10,281 --> 02:46:11,420
I'm not making this Bahamas trip.

2957
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:18,800
Oh fuck. Show I tried and
put a description over to
you haven't escaped prisoner.

2958
02:46:20,210 --> 02:46:23,480
Possibly escaped prisoner cause I don't
want to admit that the prisoners escaped

2959
02:46:23,481 --> 02:46:26,390
yet because I don't know if he is, but
he's just not here. I don't see him.

2960
02:46:26,391 --> 02:46:30,200
He's gone. So if, if I put over the
hair and escaped prisoner, I'm already,

2961
02:46:30,260 --> 02:46:32,870
I just cost myself 10 days vacation.
Okay.

2962
02:46:32,871 --> 02:46:35,720
That's mandatory minimum by
law and the police department,

2963
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:40,610
if you lose a prisoner, you lose 10 days
vacation. Whoa. So now I'm not shaving.

2964
02:46:41,770 --> 02:46:45,170
All right. I can't. I'm running
around fucking kings county hospital.

2965
02:46:45,171 --> 02:46:48,560
I left my gun. Only I have on
is my gun. I have, you know,

2966
02:46:48,561 --> 02:46:51,890
cops have a jacket with your badge on
it. I took the jacket off. So all it,

2967
02:46:51,900 --> 02:46:54,830
all I have is a radio and a gun and
running around looking for a fucking

2968
02:46:54,831 --> 02:46:57,470
prisoner was cops pull up. They
see a guy with a radio. When a gun,

2969
02:46:57,471 --> 02:46:59,870
they don't see cop in uniform.
They don't know what the fuck I am.

2970
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:02,870
I'm putting over there a
possible escape prison.

2971
02:47:02,871 --> 02:47:06,470
So the communication communicate,
I don't get shot,

2972
02:47:06,590 --> 02:47:10,940
but the communications office on the
phone goes, says, can you call me?

2973
02:47:10,970 --> 02:47:14,540
So I call her off with a course.
We call it central.

2974
02:47:14,541 --> 02:47:17,570
So I call central essentially. What's
your number? So I call it, she goes to me,

2975
02:47:17,940 --> 02:47:20,900
officer,
what is a possible escaped prisoner?

2976
02:47:21,020 --> 02:47:25,010
It's either he's escaped or he's not.
I go central.

2977
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:28,100
It's not something I want to put over
the air that the fucking guy, he's gone.

2978
02:47:28,310 --> 02:47:31,310
I said, he may be gone. He may be
down the block, he may be sleeping.

2979
02:47:31,311 --> 02:47:36,080
I can't find them. She goes, okay. And
she says, what's he wearing? He says,

2980
02:47:36,081 --> 02:47:39,560
hospital garb. Green Hospital garb. Okay,

2981
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:42,620
shoot.

2982
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:46,520
She puts over the year a possible escape
prison from Kings County hospital.

2983
02:47:46,521 --> 02:47:51,320
We're in Green Hospital garb.
15 minutes later, seven,

2984
02:47:51,321 --> 02:47:56,030
five hospital posts on the air. Six,
seven sergeant. Yeah. What's up?

2985
02:47:56,031 --> 02:48:00,140
So yeah, we have a guy here. Can
you come meet us at the front lobby?

2986
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:02,810
The king and the king's county hospital
people don't know is the size of the

2987
02:48:02,811 --> 02:48:06,500
fucking whole neighborhood. It's
huge. It's probably a mile this way.

2988
02:48:06,501 --> 02:48:10,670
A mile that way with 50 buildings in it.
And it's like a guarded fence.

2989
02:48:10,671 --> 02:48:12,580
But you know there's no gods
and there's no real fancy.

2990
02:48:12,581 --> 02:48:14,030
It's just brick walls all over the place.

2991
02:48:15,380 --> 02:48:18,830
So all of a sudden he comes
walking in with the guy,

2992
02:48:19,310 --> 02:48:22,880
the sergeant in this and a driver come
walking in with the guy and all I can do

2993
02:48:22,881 --> 02:48:24,710
is want to kill this
fucking guy cause I'm done.

2994
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:27,380
Now the duty captain has to come down,

2995
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:29,120
three captains going to
see that I haven't shaved.

2996
02:48:29,121 --> 02:48:32,440
And so now I'm upstairs trying to shave
and I'm bleeding now cause they give

2997
02:48:32,450 --> 02:48:35,510
these safety raises,
they go cut anything but you.

2998
02:48:35,690 --> 02:48:38,780
So I'm shaving my face with the
safety razor. I got blood all over me.

2999
02:48:38,781 --> 02:48:40,600
I'm trying to wipe it up
because as soon as he escaped,

3000
02:48:40,601 --> 02:48:42,380
it's the first thing I did
after I called for the bat,

3001
02:48:42,530 --> 02:48:45,020
I started shaving his beard on my
face. Or if, cause I know I'm done,

3002
02:48:45,140 --> 02:48:46,940
I'm getting interviewed by a duty captain,

3003
02:48:47,030 --> 02:48:49,670
it's going to smell the fucking booze
on my breath. And My, and my, I got,

3004
02:48:49,671 --> 02:48:52,980
my face is not quaffed
so I'm done because,

3005
02:48:53,060 --> 02:48:55,640
not because this is going to
bring attention to my drunkenness.

3006
02:48:57,020 --> 02:48:59,660
So I'm shaving and bleeding
incomes of sergeant,

3007
02:48:59,810 --> 02:49:04,460
but this fucking inmate convict
whatever he is and Perp and, um,

3008
02:49:06,020 --> 02:49:09,630
I look at him, he looks at me, I go,
what the fuck did you do? He goes,

3009
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:13,220
there was voices telling me I had to go.
They were telling me I had to run. I go,

3010
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:17,190
I pick them up. You know,
you get superhuman stinks.

3011
02:49:17,400 --> 02:49:18,780
I pick them up at one hand like this.

3012
02:49:18,781 --> 02:49:22,350
I got them against the class in Kings
County hospital and I go to him.

3013
02:49:23,220 --> 02:49:25,590
I want to fucking knock them out,
but the silence right there, right.

3014
02:49:25,830 --> 02:49:27,790
So I just go take it easy, take
it easy, take it easy. You know,

3015
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:32,160
he just cost me fucking 10 days,
but I can't go on my vacation now.

3016
02:49:32,430 --> 02:49:35,280
So I let him down and uh,

3017
02:49:36,590 --> 02:49:37,423
I go

3018
02:49:37,870 --> 02:49:41,740
drag them back to this, his, his, uh, his
appointed bad. Now I'm going to fucking,

3019
02:49:41,770 --> 02:49:44,180
I want to put the cuffs around
his neck. Right? I'm like,

3020
02:49:44,310 --> 02:49:45,840
I know I shouldn't have fucking know.
I Dunno.

3021
02:49:45,880 --> 02:49:49,870
I Dunno what the voices are telling
me. I look up on his bed, it says HIV.

3022
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:52,463
No.
Back then

3023
02:49:53,660 --> 02:49:57,360
HIV was like, you know, yeah,
you're done. I'm done. Right.

3024
02:49:57,440 --> 02:50:01,190
I think I got aids now touching them.
I think I got fucking aids.

3025
02:50:01,330 --> 02:50:04,550
So here am I just touched
your stays patient. I'm dying,

3026
02:50:04,580 --> 02:50:08,270
he's dying and I'm going on vacation
and I'm not, what am I gonna do now?

3027
02:50:08,540 --> 02:50:10,490
How do you respond to this?
So I don't know what to do.

3028
02:50:12,140 --> 02:50:14,830
So I'm waiting for the duty captain to
come by. I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding still.

3029
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:18,080
I got holes in my face right now.
I can't even touch myself. I was,

3030
02:50:18,110 --> 02:50:21,500
I just touched him with my hands right
now. I got AIDS on my hands. I'm bleeding.

3031
02:50:21,530 --> 02:50:24,470
I'm done. I might as well just
signing my death warrant right now.

3032
02:50:26,030 --> 02:50:30,170
Not to mention, you know, I'm not
making this vacation because anyway,

3033
02:50:31,070 --> 02:50:35,990
they come to relieve me. And uh, how
the story turns out is I ended up,

3034
02:50:36,110 --> 02:50:40,070
I ended up on vacation in a timely manner.
I'm supposed to process the arrest.

3035
02:50:40,100 --> 02:50:41,900
The arrest took me about
15 minutes to process.

3036
02:50:41,901 --> 02:50:46,490
So I walked back into the precinct and
lieutenant on the desk goes, doubt,

3037
02:50:47,450 --> 02:50:49,980
you got to go back down to central booking
and processed the rest of that didn't

3038
02:50:49,990 --> 02:50:54,350
make that, that escaped. I don't,
I do. You're going to see that go.

3039
02:50:55,070 --> 02:50:57,950
I hand them a piece of paper.
Here's the arrest report to 61, uh,

3040
02:50:58,140 --> 02:51:02,180
the aided card and my overtime
slip. He goes, you're done.

3041
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:05,000
Cause it's the guy who was trying to bang
my girlfriend. I ain't got shit done.

3042
02:51:05,660 --> 02:51:09,200
The guy who spotted popped in with the
red corvette. He goes, you're done. I go,

3043
02:51:09,201 --> 02:51:11,450
there's my, my arrest number. He
hated me. Hated each other. I go,

3044
02:51:11,451 --> 02:51:12,350
there's my arrest number,

3045
02:51:12,500 --> 02:51:14,960
there's the fucking the complaint
number and there's the aided card.

3046
02:51:15,140 --> 02:51:18,260
And then them overtime slip.
He knew I was going on vacation.

3047
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:22,700
He called shot fucking fuming.
So ps, I lost the perp.

3048
02:51:22,701 --> 02:51:26,000
I got him back and I still
made the vacation. Wow.

3049
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:31,370
And I ended up not losing the 10 days.
They forgot. They forgot to interview me.

3050
02:51:31,850 --> 02:51:33,870
They forgot their view. You. Yeah, I get,

3051
02:51:33,950 --> 02:51:37,280
I get end up getting interviewed about
a year later on that and they took

3052
02:51:37,281 --> 02:51:40,280
something from me, but it was like, yeah,
it's like it was happening. She hands.

3053
02:51:40,281 --> 02:51:42,090
Then they have this whole,

3054
02:51:42,290 --> 02:51:45,440
we have the sole thing
sitting around on our desk.

3055
02:51:45,830 --> 02:51:49,460
I got whatever it's over with now.
So the, the sting wasn't there and I,

3056
02:51:49,870 --> 02:51:53,360
I talked to lose my job.
You know, I'm drunk on duty,
losing the prison to come on.

3057
02:51:53,390 --> 02:51:56,510
Right. How could you not
lose your job? You got lucky.

3058
02:51:57,260 --> 02:52:00,830
Maybe did I definitely, I would've
lost my job. I would have safe. Right?

3059
02:52:00,980 --> 02:52:04,940
I don't know. I don't
know. I mean, I hate to,

3060
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:06,040
everything happens for

3061
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:06,461
a reason.

3062
02:52:06,461 --> 02:52:11,461
I fucking hate that saying sometimes
it applies scary Jesus Christ.

3063
02:52:12,970 --> 02:52:17,500
But you got to feel lucky that you went
through all this and you're still alive

3064
02:52:17,501 --> 02:52:21,740
and he's still healthy. And I
am very lucky and blessed. Yeah.

3065
02:52:22,660 --> 02:52:27,530
Yeah. I mean, you, you've lived off, I
mean to say you've lived a colorful life.

3066
02:52:27,770 --> 02:52:31,620
Tired. He'd have to be Jesus Christ.
You've been running up hills. Fuck.

3067
02:52:31,630 --> 02:52:36,070
Just telling you these stories you carry
and awaits your whole life on Coke on

3068
02:52:36,071 --> 02:52:39,370
these sticks. She spindles of
Aleks, Jesus fucking Christ.

3069
02:52:39,790 --> 02:52:43,940
It's a crazy story and, and I'm sure you
have a million crazy stories like that.

3070
02:52:44,350 --> 02:52:47,230
That's, that's an easy one. That
was an easy one to tell you. No,

3071
02:52:47,650 --> 02:52:50,500
that's a four minute one.
Yeah. I just couldn't imagine.

3072
02:52:51,190 --> 02:52:54,570
I really do hope that this
does become a book. Well,

3073
02:52:54,580 --> 02:52:57,250
I'd like to share the stories because
they're interesting and funny, you know?

3074
02:52:57,360 --> 02:52:59,990
Yeah.
And you know what a lot of people like to,

3075
02:53:00,580 --> 02:53:03,910
not that they don't want to give the
recognition to that. This is what life is.

3076
02:53:03,911 --> 02:53:07,150
People live a life and you have to
share your story for people. You know,

3077
02:53:07,180 --> 02:53:11,410
you really do know. I like to talk
so well in the little the time.

3078
02:53:11,440 --> 02:53:15,940
It's like you, you were alive during
the perfect time or all this happened.

3079
02:53:16,820 --> 02:53:20,710
Right. The crack notice that like
you started out before the crack era,

3080
02:53:20,860 --> 02:53:25,860
the crack era happened while you were
in destroyed a large community of people

3081
02:53:26,081 --> 02:53:29,560
and people that weren't even part of the
community got destroyed because of it.

3082
02:53:29,620 --> 02:53:33,160
And it's think about how much would,

3083
02:53:33,190 --> 02:53:35,980
how much of it would be different
today because of cell phones,

3084
02:53:35,981 --> 02:53:38,650
because of the Internet. I
mean, it's just, you know,

3085
02:53:38,651 --> 02:53:40,750
we can bring it to this conversation,
that direction.

3086
02:53:40,750 --> 02:53:42,300
It wouldn't be the way it was,
that's for sure.

3087
02:53:42,370 --> 02:53:46,060
There's no way I talk about this
often. I think you really, you know,

3088
02:53:46,061 --> 02:53:49,120
you have to get with it. You
have to, you have to move along.

3089
02:53:49,310 --> 02:53:53,140
The police society has to move
along. You know, I, I listen,

3090
02:53:53,860 --> 02:53:56,620
I tell a story in the movie,
got a cop gets shot, right?

3091
02:53:56,680 --> 02:54:01,480
I ended up taking him to the hospital,
uh, and I didn't deserve to feel his pain.

3092
02:54:01,481 --> 02:54:05,410
And that's, that's a really hard
thing for a guy who was a cop.

3093
02:54:05,800 --> 02:54:10,120
I didn't deserve to feel what happened
to him and his family. And, uh,

3094
02:54:10,870 --> 02:54:13,720
you really, when you're a cop, you don't
want to ever feel that way. I mean,

3095
02:54:13,900 --> 02:54:18,820
did you feel like you were a cop did
when they were in the middle of it all?

3096
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:22,390
You know what, Joe, I always felt
like a cop. I just always do.

3097
02:54:22,391 --> 02:54:25,450
I can come back and be a comp sci.
You always thought like,

3098
02:54:25,451 --> 02:54:27,970
eventually I'm going to let
this stuff called to grow up.

3099
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:33,270
Just never got a chance.
I'm going to smell up,

3100
02:54:33,670 --> 02:54:37,820
piled up so much. You know,
you know, it's, it's Kinda,

3101
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:42,430
it's a fucking crazy life man. It's really
crazy. It's not a good life, you know,

3102
02:54:42,431 --> 02:54:44,450
and the fact that we pay,
we're saying that, you know,

3103
02:54:44,470 --> 02:54:48,400
I could sit on a pile of gold or whatever,
but I love to hear that he wants to,

3104
02:54:48,580 --> 02:54:51,370
you know, that it's just as you turn
something bad into something good is, is,

3105
02:54:51,371 --> 02:54:56,260
is a good thing. But it was fucking hell.
And still, you know, I mean I'm sometimes,

3106
02:54:56,560 --> 02:54:58,990
I can't even go up to a comp today and
say, hey, you're doing, I'm like down.

3107
02:54:59,530 --> 02:55:02,980
You could do that to any cop. And they
said, Joe, nice to meet Ya. I love Ya.

3108
02:55:03,170 --> 02:55:04,340
I do that. I'm like, you know,

3109
02:55:04,970 --> 02:55:08,180
they really want to say hello to me or
what do you want to just clean it fucking

3110
02:55:08,181 --> 02:55:10,620
hand? You know, I had a guy
come up to me to at, at, uh,

3111
02:55:10,670 --> 02:55:14,400
I don't want them to previews
I did or screenings and said,

3112
02:55:14,401 --> 02:55:18,470
you're a fucking low life piece
of shit. Go Fuck Yourself.
It was a cop. Yeah. Yeah.

3113
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:21,860
I probably couldn't squash them like a
bug, but that's not the point. You know,

3114
02:55:21,861 --> 02:55:26,080
and I want to show, I looked at him and
I fucking squash you. You couldn't it be,

3115
02:55:26,081 --> 02:55:28,750
you have to cop. I was, when I, when I
did my job. Well you couldn't be helped,

3116
02:55:28,751 --> 02:55:30,130
right. What it was. But you know,

3117
02:55:30,290 --> 02:55:32,810
the problem was like dabbled
on both sides of the same time.

3118
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:36,080
That's why in the movie they said,
what were your copper? A gangster both,

3119
02:55:36,350 --> 02:55:37,310
you know?
Yeah.

3120
02:55:37,490 --> 02:55:42,110
There's that scene where the one
cop sees you coming out and he says,

3121
02:55:42,111 --> 02:55:45,770
he looks at you and he goes, and I don't
see cop. I see purple. Right. Well,

3122
02:55:45,780 --> 02:55:49,520
he's a Douche bag. They don't like
him. Why is that? No one likes him.

3123
02:55:49,610 --> 02:55:51,110
Internal affairs doesn't
like him. Really? Yeah.

3124
02:55:51,111 --> 02:55:53,600
I'm working with internal affairs right
now by the way. You're working with them?

3125
02:55:53,630 --> 02:55:57,820
Yeah. I didn't tell him something. No,
no, no. I'm trading them. I'm in the,

3126
02:55:57,830 --> 02:56:02,830
we're in the midst of finishing of a
training video for bosses comps and uh,

3127
02:56:04,140 --> 02:56:07,850
and, and recruits three different
videos. Wow. Well that makes sense.

3128
02:56:07,880 --> 02:56:10,330
That seems like something that you
would really be able to help. Yeah,

3129
02:56:10,430 --> 02:56:13,340
I think I could. And I,
you know, I put a little,

3130
02:56:13,830 --> 02:56:16,400
a lot of these films are so dry
and boring and I couldn't live.

3131
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:19,750
I give it a little character
to the fucking training
session, you know, listen,

3132
02:56:19,760 --> 02:56:23,090
I met two beautiful women and I'm being
honest, and he told us pledge spoke,

3133
02:56:23,091 --> 02:56:23,924
I want to,

3134
02:56:24,050 --> 02:56:28,010
one was the chief of internal affairs
and one was a lieutenant and turn off is

3135
02:56:28,011 --> 02:56:30,590
both smoking hot. Yeah. For Real.

3136
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:33,740
And they would have had me in a
minute if they just sent that man.

3137
02:56:33,741 --> 02:56:38,720
I would've been caught in
1987. But anyway, uh, these
two girls, uh, women and they,

3138
02:56:38,721 --> 02:56:41,060
uh, they fucking just, they knew,

3139
02:56:41,510 --> 02:56:45,680
they knew that their internal affairs
division needed something that was after

3140
02:56:45,681 --> 02:56:50,270
the word poignant or, or riveting.
And they said, we need you,

3141
02:56:50,390 --> 02:56:53,330
can you help us? It needs some character.
They need some character. Yeah.

3142
02:56:53,331 --> 02:56:55,500
People don't pay attention
to information for the list.

3143
02:56:55,501 --> 02:56:57,560
It's distributed in an entertaining way.

3144
02:56:58,010 --> 02:57:00,350
There's a big difference
between just flat, boring,

3145
02:57:00,351 --> 02:57:04,430
dry information information that's
got some, some flavor to it. And so I,

3146
02:57:04,440 --> 02:57:07,370
I did something with them
and, uh, I in fact, in fact,

3147
02:57:07,371 --> 02:57:09,560
I spoke to them last week
briefly and I told him, you know,

3148
02:57:09,561 --> 02:57:11,930
some of the things I was doing, they were
sort of acting jealous. I said, jealous,

3149
02:57:11,931 --> 02:57:14,210
you got to fucking pension.
Don't be jealous. Okay.

3150
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:17,300
I'm selling my soul right now just to,
to, to, to make ends meet, you know,

3151
02:57:17,301 --> 02:57:19,970
and they get a pension and retirement
system, they're gonna be fine, you know,

3152
02:57:20,570 --> 02:57:24,710
but interesting conversation with them.
And, uh, so they are looking to, um,

3153
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:29,630
to do something with that and have me
back and speak before w academy class or

3154
02:57:29,690 --> 02:57:30,740
you know,
I don't know about the precincts.

3155
02:57:30,741 --> 02:57:33,830
The guys might not open their arms to me
the way that the rookies are forced to,

3156
02:57:33,950 --> 02:57:37,370
you know, and then, and then I'm doing
a little some colleges right now.

3157
02:57:37,420 --> 02:57:40,550
I'm [inaudible] yeah, that sounds
great. A humanities classes,

3158
02:57:40,580 --> 02:57:42,480
some ethical classes,
uh,

3159
02:57:42,500 --> 02:57:47,060
for the law students and the criminal
justice departments. Uh, one of the, uh,

3160
02:57:47,120 --> 02:57:51,980
one of the, uh, police
departments is actually reached
out to me, um, in the south.

3161
02:57:52,010 --> 02:57:54,260
I don't want to put their name out
there just in case you decide not to,

3162
02:57:54,650 --> 02:57:56,660
but they have like 750 officers.
They want me to come.

3163
02:57:56,661 --> 02:57:59,240
And actually it's a great idea
and it makes a lot of sense.

3164
02:57:59,241 --> 02:58:02,010
I'm a very smart idea, you know, look, uh,

3165
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:07,050
what I did was horrific. You know, I've
used a position to trust. I did my time.

3166
02:58:07,080 --> 02:58:11,430
Now I hope I can help people avoid guys
that can do what I did and it will pick

3167
02:58:11,431 --> 02:58:14,070
up, pick up on it. And, and
how maybe how to stop before,

3168
02:58:14,250 --> 02:58:16,980
like this may be guy has
the characteristics of a
guy that could go that way.

3169
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:19,260
You know,
this is not an innocent happening.

3170
02:58:19,440 --> 02:58:22,290
This thing's just didn't happen for
because I was like greedy, which,

3171
02:58:22,500 --> 02:58:24,150
which is definitely part
of the reason it happened,

3172
02:58:24,300 --> 02:58:27,090
happened because of a bunch of political
things I will put in place back in the

3173
02:58:27,090 --> 02:58:29,850
80s we started promoting people based on,
based on their,

3174
02:58:29,890 --> 02:58:33,090
the color of their skin or their ethnicity
rather than on their promotional,

3175
02:58:33,091 --> 02:58:36,630
a ratings, passing tests. And
it was very, very divisive.

3176
02:58:36,631 --> 02:58:41,130
The police department became divided
and we all became our own actors.

3177
02:58:41,850 --> 02:58:45,060
And it was, it was a difficult
time for the police department.

3178
02:58:45,090 --> 02:58:49,890
And what you got from it was a lot of
internal strife called we hated the job,

3179
02:58:49,891 --> 02:58:52,770
what we love being cops.
So it was very difficult.

3180
02:58:52,771 --> 02:58:55,560
And the guys that love being
cops that were true to the job,

3181
02:58:56,100 --> 02:58:57,620
they became good cops
and got the pensions.

3182
02:58:57,660 --> 02:59:01,380
The guys like myself who turned into me,
they began to rebel,

3183
02:59:01,580 --> 02:59:03,720
come in and they're telling you
not to make arrests. You know,

3184
02:59:03,721 --> 02:59:06,810
they're telling you not to do this and
your boss failed three tests and you

3185
02:59:06,820 --> 02:59:09,390
passed. You didn't, if you
didn't pass a Meta, but you know,

3186
02:59:09,391 --> 02:59:12,180
so you both should be in the same ground.
Now he's your boss or she's your boss.

3187
02:59:12,480 --> 02:59:13,141
So it was a very,

3188
02:59:13,141 --> 02:59:17,250
very political upturning upheaval
within the police department itself.

3189
02:59:17,310 --> 02:59:22,060
When this rife time in the crack
era hit all at the same time. Yeah.

3190
02:59:22,330 --> 02:59:24,780
It's like a perfect storm. It was
a perfect storm. The whole thing.

3191
02:59:24,790 --> 02:59:27,880
It wasn't fresco and they didn't want
another fucking scandal like they had in

3192
02:59:27,881 --> 02:59:29,050
the 77th precinct.
Right.

3193
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:32,520
Which people aren't aware of unless
they know the police department history.

3194
02:59:33,090 --> 02:59:35,040
Mike, we just sit three hours. Oh fuck.

3195
02:59:35,190 --> 02:59:37,970
That was it. That's just, that's
three hours. Just fucking listen.

3196
02:59:38,390 --> 02:59:40,530
We talked about the
[inaudible] dot com yes.

3197
02:59:40,560 --> 02:59:43,740
[inaudible] dot com and that's where
people should buy the documentary,

3198
02:59:43,741 --> 02:59:48,180
the seven five and Dubai, the documentary
because it is fucking five stars.

3199
02:59:48,240 --> 02:59:51,990
Thank you. It's outstanding. And it was
well done. It was very, very well done.

3200
02:59:51,991 --> 02:59:56,010
And it's, it's compelling. And, uh, so are
you, man. Thank you very much, brother.

3201
02:59:56,011 --> 02:59:59,200
I really appreciate it. I'm
very happy, man. You've got
to do this again. Oh, great.

3202
02:59:59,350 --> 03:00:01,590
Hey, look to thanks. All
right, fuckers. See soon.

3203
03:00:05,840 --> 03:00:06,673
Ooh,

3204
03:00:16,290 --> 03:00:16,360
yeah.
