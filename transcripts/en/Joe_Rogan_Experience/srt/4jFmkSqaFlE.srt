1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,670
you gave it an eight.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,620
I think garage bands pretty amazing too.

4
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:05,020
The,

5
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,360
the program where you can pretty much
make your own song pretty easily.

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,340
Don't they have programs
like that for your phone now?

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,761
Oh yeah.

8
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,150
Yeah,

9
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,810
absolutely.

10
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,643
Absolutely.

11
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:14,750
There was,

12
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,780
I don't know if we ever talked about it.

13
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:16,380
There was this,

14
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,520
back in the day in my space,

15
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,354
somebody linked,

16
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:18,900
uh,

17
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,900
one of my songs on their myspace page
and like stole it from my web host.

18
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,460
And so like when you went
to their myspace page,

19
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:29,310
it automatically played a song for myself.

20
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:29,850
So I,

21
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,190
what I did is I took that file,

22
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:32,971
took it down,

23
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:35,970
and then made up a quick song
and garage band about like,

24
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,301
ah,

25
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,160
Stacy from Hollywood,

26
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:38,994
California.

27
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,630
I want you to suck my Dick and made a
whole song just about how I wanted to fuck

28
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:43,980
this girl and stuff like that.

29
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,780
And I replaced that song,

30
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,853
that file,

31
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,710
what the original file so that when
people went to her myspace page,

32
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,440
it just started playing that song.

33
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,523
Yeah.

34
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,921
I just love it.

35
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,550
I don't know how that,

36
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,500
why even thought about that,

37
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,800
but it's pretty funny video.

38
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,210
It's funny when you think that with a
hot linking and speaking of my space,

39
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,780
I think the yesterday what
officially really just downsize.

40
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,240
They shut off Germany,

41
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,440
my space,

42
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,370
Germany is dead.

43
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,370
Somebody tweeted me,

44
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,700
my space cut all their
employees like three months ago.

45
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,870
Like half of their employees,

46
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,910
they cut Jordan and
they just did it again.

47
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,481
Jordy.

48
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:15,840
Yeah,

49
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,740
Jordy was rich and now you're lucky to,

50
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:22,530
you know he's worth comedy central
but they use working memory.

51
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:22,861
We would come.

52
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:24,210
My sweets comedy was thriving.

53
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:25,790
I'm sure you did one
of those secret shows.

54
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,210
I do want a secret shows.

55
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,450
I'm thinking about deleting
my mind space live on the air.

56
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,790
What do you think do it
if they're going to cut,

57
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,200
show and ruin.

58
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,650
You know,

59
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,570
it's funny how we did it with a,

60
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:37,350
I think,

61
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,320
I forget who we did it with,

62
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,260
like Jason Tebow or something like that.

63
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:41,190
Somebody deleted their,

64
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:44,020
my space the other day live on
air a on the old one podcast.

65
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:44,370
Christ.

66
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,200
I can't even come up
with one original idea,

67
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,390
but watch how many steps it is.

68
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,224
It's pretty hilarious.

69
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,040
It was Ari.

70
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,770
Ari did it and it was like three steps.

71
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,880
Like they make it really hard.

72
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,210
Like are you sure you

73
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,040
still have people on it
trying to talk to you?

74
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,791
Very,

75
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:00,271
very,

76
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:00,751
very,

77
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:01,620
very few.

78
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,530
Almost all of it is
completely dead as well.

79
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,120
You want to go into my
mind that also will duel?

80
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,470
Yeah,

81
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,001
dual one.

82
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,200
I paid some money to have my
tricked out too at one point.

83
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,743
Yeah.

84
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,910
Did you have glitter tags?

85
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,460
I don't know.

86
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,360
It seems like you would
probably cause a failure.

87
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm just,

88
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,633
I can even say it.

89
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,150
So if you want to delete
your my space now too,

90
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,470
and we could have a double my space
and I'm going to keep mine hide this

91
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,313
motherfucker.

92
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,153
It's not easy.

93
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,380
I don't even know where to go.

94
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,340
Um,

95
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,031
here,

96
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:34,110
I'll tell you guys where to go.

97
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,810
Hold on.

98
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,550
Um,

99
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,383
more.

100
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,410
Delete my space.

101
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,480
I don't even know if I know my
family that it's time to let it go.

102
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,081
You know what I mean?

103
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:46,590
It's like the girl that you dated 10
years ago and his phone number still in

104
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:47,424
your book.

105
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,810
Throw that shit out,

106
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,713
son.

107
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,710
Moldovan it's in your book.

108
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,191
Listen to me.

109
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:53,581
Your book,

110
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:54,900
who is a phone book anymore?

111
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,550
Phone books are worth nothing.

112
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,421
Fuck you.

113
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,530
And your phone book.

114
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:58,910
What?

115
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,280
I to write it on paper.

116
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,540
Like some caveman.

117
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,740
The good for standing on.

118
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,950
Yeah.

119
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,240
Why don't you just give me some burnt
sticks and I'll use it to carve the

120
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,680
fucking numbers on a rock.

121
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,150
How did delete,

122
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,133
how did he do it?

123
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,921
And now I can't even,

124
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,740
can't even figure it out.

125
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:12,791
Oh,

126
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,420
here you go.

127
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,253
There you go.

128
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,920
All right.

129
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,990
If you decided to delete my space,

130
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,360
what you do is more,

131
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:19,660
um,

132
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,730
you go to my account and then,

133
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,840
uh,

134
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,740
where's my account?

135
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,290
It's under more my stuff.

136
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,190
My stuff.

137
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,560
Account settings right here.

138
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,580
Account settings.

139
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,510
And then you go,

140
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,111
it looks different.

141
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:32,831
I have to give them that.

142
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:33,310
Yeah,

143
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,130
it looks different.

144
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,210
It doesn't lie.

145
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,260
Logo this case,

146
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,600
should we give him a chance now
that they redesigned everything?

147
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,640
Damn Owl.

148
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,780
We committed to this,

149
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:44,614
bro.

150
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,730
We've committed to this man.

151
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,290
We're going to show us everything in here.

152
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:47,731
It looks good.

153
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:48,281
Hey look,

154
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,060
white details.

155
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,570
Remember the,

156
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,710
I constantly had those
horrible fucking ads.

157
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,650
Full account.

158
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,483
Here we go.

159
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,490
I don't want to cancel.

160
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,290
She was smiley face or something.

161
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,260
I said Brian is not just cancel account.

162
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:02,531
Right?

163
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:03,130
It's deleted.

164
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,860
I want to delete.

165
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,090
No,

166
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,930
you want to cancel account?

167
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,650
Where's it?

168
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:05,850
Yep.

169
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,050
Am canceling.

170
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,361
Yeah,

171
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:08,350
we're sorry.

172
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,370
You want to leave,

173
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,990

help us improve my space.

175
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,411

177
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,960
privacy and email.

178
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:20,794
I'm going to go with spam.

179
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,890
That's the one thing that annoyed him.

180
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,630
Where is it Joe?

181
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,160
Where's the cancer council account?

182
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,600
Under settings.

183
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,060
Under settings go under
account settings and privacy

184
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,020
settings and cancellation comments.

185
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,600
Thanks for the love and
the last but it's over.

186
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,070
Bitchiness it's not down there.

187
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,590
Yeah.

188
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,400
Oh there we go.

189
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,233
We go privacy.

190
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,530
But they do hide it.

191
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,700
They hide it a below the fold.

192
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,534
Yeah.

193
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,460
And then you just got to
keep on scrolling down.

194
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,750
Oh for bitches.

195
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,160
Um,

196
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,740
and you know what's even
pisses cancel account hose.

197
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,850
It's over.

198
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,410
My request has been sent.

199
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,670
You will receive an email shortly
with instructions for confirming.

200
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,663
Yeah.

201
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,563
Yeah.

202
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,100
Why won't you just let me walk away?

203
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,111
That's what they're doing.

204
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:04,590
A divorce.

205
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,850
Now you have to go to your
email and click on a link.

206
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,991
It's like a divorce.

207
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,200
So do it now because they don't want to,

208
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,160
they want to pretend they have
more people on my street toward,

209
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,830
yes,

210
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,920
we had one on my space for a while
until you did you end up deleting it?

211
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,200
No,

212
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,490
no,

213
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,001
I can't.

214
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:16,781
I tried to delete it.

215
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,430
They won't let him know he's fucks.

216
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,440
My space are so tricky.

217
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,601
Like,

218
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:19,751
yeah,

219
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:20,920
we'll get back to you with an email.

220
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,840
It's like a girl that you
can never break up with.

221
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,380
Right.

222
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,120
I'll call you back and then
we'll break up the pitch.

223
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:25,954
Never calls you back.

224
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:35,990
Okay.
