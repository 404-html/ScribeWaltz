1
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,520
Gentlemen tardy,
but here nonetheless,

2
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,940
sort of,
it's like halfway through because the 

3
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:38,950
uh,
the one on Ustream says 3:00

4
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,020
and this one says a and I said at 2:00
because I'm an Indian,

5
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,540
but it's supposed to be 3:00,
so we figured we'll start somewhere 

6
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,291
around.
Now it's all about checking out the 

7
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:52,291
twitter that I to find out when really 
going on.

8
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:52,720
Well,
that's ridiculous Brian,

9
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,600
because some people have lives and they 
can't just be on the fucking twitter all

10
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:56,380
the time looking for you.

11
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Shit.
Have you met people that have their 

12
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:01,500
twitter setup?
So when twit they

13
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,100
automatically get like a text message.
I don't know.

14
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,080
People get mad at me sometimes you may,
you're tweet too much,

15
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:13,081
man.
It's blowing up my phone to take you 

16
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:13,081
off.
That's ridiculous.

17
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:17,161
Why would you have.
I think maybe in the beginning it was 

18
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:17,161
almost like an instant message for 
people,

19
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,940
you know,
but it really,

20
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:20,800
that's just text messaging.
That's someone who,

21
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,650
you know,
text messaging but text messaging to all

22
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,530
their friends.
Right?

23
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,920
And then it got crazy,
you know,

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,070
it's a strange way of communicating.
Now,

25
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,460
twitter is one of the weirdest fucking 
interventions that the Internet has ever

26
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,080
spurland sparring.
Spring gives birth to shit out.

27
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
It's amazing.
It's just,

28
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:43,840
it's so simple.
Keep it to 140 characters so that,

29
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:44,530
uh,
you know,

30
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:48,700
you don't get to fucking verbose stupid.
You learn how to edit your shit,

31
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,480
you know,
you can't have these long run on.

32
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,950
You ever read someone's blogs?
And even my own blogs ramble so much,

33
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,230
too much sometimes.
But some people,

34
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,250
your blogs are for smart people that you
know,

35
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:02,230
like,
like readers,

36
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:07,231
like I have to be in a reader mode most 
of the time I'm in more of a video to 

37
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,040
bullshit.
I don't want to read anything like that.

38
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:11,910
I write,
but,

39
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,240
but uh,
it,

40
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:15,070
it's.
Sometimes I do,

41
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,560
I times I think when I have what I want 
to write it,

42
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,030
I have to write it.
Whatever the,

43
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,240
if I'm writing something,
it's just because that's what I'm 

44
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,281
thinking about and I've been fucking 
with it and I've been rolling around in 

45
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:26,281
my head,
you know,

46
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:29,140
and they might not be correct.
I have no idea.

47
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,180
Most of them,
most of my ideas are just pure 

48
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,151
speculation,
but the only way to really be honest 

49
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,090
about it,
so write in a blog.

50
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:38,890
You can't like tell people stuff like 
that.

51
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,090
You start talking to people about your 
theories and you suddenly got nut least 

52
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,590
if you write it down for whatever 
reason,

53
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,940
it looks more thought out.
Isn't that weird?

54
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,200
You know,
have you just tell people that you think

55
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:58,201
that technology,
some sort of a symbiotic life form 

56
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:01,310
that's existing with us and eventually 
it's going to overcome us and then 

57
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,470
everybody's looking at it like we 
control it always,

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,490
you know?
No,

59
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,290
no,
like those terminator movies,

60
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,090
those guys got it right.
Like,

61
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:10,180
that's like super possible.
It really is.

62
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,430
I mean,
no one wants to believe that,

63
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:16,680
but if you look at how fucking chaotic 
human life is and not,

64
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,840
not really in America,
you know,

65
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:24,841
this is pretty bad ass country,
but if you watch like documentaries on 

66
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,250
like that vice squad guide to Liberia,
is that what it was?

67
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,810
What is the,
the website?

68
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,400
Did we talk about that last week?

69
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,160
Uh,
W,

70
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:35,140
W,
what was it about those vice tv guys,

71
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,320
those guys that go to Liberia and talk 
about all the cannibalism and shit 

72
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,410
that's going on?
It seems like you did.

73
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,700
We did talk about it.
If you haven't seen it.

74
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Well,
I'm going to find the link and throw it 

75
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,441
up anyway because it's so crazy.
There's that link also that you talked 

76
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:49,510
about last week that somebody said that 
you didn't.

77
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,830
Did you ever.
They were like,

78
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:53,440
this links not working.
A lot of people are saying a,

79
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,470
I forget what it was about maybe the 
lions that you were talking about the 

80
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:58,470
lions last last week that,
that,

81
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,120
uh,
the amped up.

82
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,240
Oh yeah.
Really that was the wrong.

83
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,790
Maybe it was that one.
There was a few,

84
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,860
there was.
I just remember because somebody said 

85
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:07,860
that they saw it.
It was amazing.

86
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:07,860
Maybe they googled it or something.
Maybe.

87
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,170
Maybe they were smart.
They were like,

88
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,740
oh,
maybe we should use google talking about

89
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,010
something or I'll give you the wrong 
way.

90
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Just let me know.
I'm sorry that that is annoying when 

91
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,090
you're trying to figure out what it is.
But most of the time Google works out 

92
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,550
pretty well.
Don't you feel like a little genius when

93
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,050
you figure out where they fucked up 
though,

94
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,940
you go back to the url and you go,
oh,

95
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:30,941
there's the bottom part of it.
You've got to copy and paste the whole 

96
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:30,980
thing they put in your browser.
It's like,

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,840
solves a little bit,

98
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,730
a little puzzle.
That's awkward.

99
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
That's a Papaya.
Kombucha.

100
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,310
Shit's good for you.
Or is it mango?

101
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,830
Papaya.
Cuban.

102
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,110
A male.
Um,

103
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,230
well it's up to other people.
The flux Kragen how's life?

104
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,350
It's like that lion shit was crazy.
Yeah.

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,670
If you haven't seen what we're talking 
about with the Lions Shit,

106
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,090
there was a,
these gigantic lions that lived in 

107
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,640
Africa and they got cut off from the 
rest of the continent and there was a,

108
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:03,641
there was stuck on an island and they 
were like regular size lines at first 

109
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:05,360
they presume and because they were on 
the island with only water,

110
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:08,750
buffalo water buffalo,
hardest to kill.

111
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:13,751
So these lions got gigantic.
They grew fucking huge from taking down 

112
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:15,980
water buffaloes.
It's really pretty fucking spooky stuff.

113
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,110
You know,
it's intense.

114
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,190
Like they looked like the hulk,
they didn't look real like,

115
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,600
yeah,
those mice that have that milestone and 

116
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:28,600
thing that they like.
Those dogs was whippets.

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,820
When they do those experiments on them 
and make them look like cartoons

118
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,400
you ever seen that?
That disease,

119
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,760
I guess it would be that makes you grow 
fast.

120
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,450
Like they just showed this a woman that 
was 12 years old,

121
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:43,820
but she looked like she was 62 and a 
smoker.

122
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,770
It has to do with the fat and your skin.
It doesn't have to do with growing fast 

123
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,990
and it has to do with the fat in your 
skin.

124
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,560
When you get older,
one of the things that happens is the 

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,171
fat leaves your skin and these people 
who are like 13 and 12 and we're little 

126
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,780
babies even they have this disease where
that's how their body like starts 

127
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,041
treating it right away so their skin 
starts to behave like an old person's 

128
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,510
skin.
Oh yeah.

129
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,560
It was weird though.
I felt so bad for her because she was 

130
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,600
really.
Her mother had it too.

131
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,610
It's terrible.
Super rare though,

132
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:17,970
so don't worry about.
It's.

133
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,420
Yeah,
but it's pretty free

134
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,480
when you find diseases like that,
you know,

135
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:23,160
but this Liberia Shit,
man,

136
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:28,161
if you haven't seen this,
I have to throw this link up because 

137
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,910
it's one of the gnarliest fucking 
documentaries I've ever seen ever.

138
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,890
And these guys,
I think this show's called vice guide TV

139
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,460
vice guide to Liberia.
I'm going to give you exactly

140
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,280
the last,
last night.

141
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,700
Yes I did without giving any spoilers.
What do you think?

142
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,450
No spoilers,
no spoilers.

143
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,620
I think uh,
I'm getting tired of it.

144
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,800
You are.
So you didn't find it exciting.

145
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,320
It was exciting,
but I like,

146
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:55,830
come on,

147
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,650
you're just jumping back in time and you
know,

148
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,570
people are dead but then they're not and
like come on really.

149
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,600
You know what I'm saying?
It's like,

150
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,100
really?
That's what's going on now.

151
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:10,180
Well,
when that one thing with the one thing 

152
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,180
and he was like,
I'm sorry for being that thing.

153
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,180
It was crazy.
Yeah,

154
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,920
it was like a certain point in time.
I was like,

155
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:14,570
God damn,
this is like comical.

156
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,430
Yeah,
it was a caricature.

157
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,400
You know what I really hated also how 
many commercials they're worried.

158
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:23,030
There were like every three minutes.
There was a commercial in the future.

159
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:24,750
Hopefully you could like go.
All right.

160
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:25,640
No,
I don't want commercials.

161
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:27,900
I want pop up ads on my tv,
you know,

162
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,980
pretty pretty nutty because that was 
just like you were into it,

163
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,000
out of it,
into it,

164
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,480
out of it.

165
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,240
Yeah.
It is pretty naughty.

166
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,670
It's,
you've got to watch it on Dvr and even 

167
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,751
then you've got to fast forward through 
commercials are a very inefficient way 

168
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:43,900
of reaching people because you're 
annoying the shit out of him,

169
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,410
you know?
I mean it does have you stuff enough 

170
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,770
shit down.
Our throats will eventually take it.

171
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:54,040
But putting it out in the middle of like
shows and stuff like that.

172
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,050
What if you could go to like a group 
once a month for like 10 minutes and 

173
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:01,250
they showed you a bunch of products and 
then they're like,

174
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:06,251
all right,
no more advertising for you on the 

175
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:06,251
internet or for the TV.
Just because you,

176
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:08,300
you know,
you went to like a group meeting just so

177
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,670
advertisers can sell their products to 
you in person.

178
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,650
You know what I mean?
Like this is coke here.

179
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:13,700
Taste tasted.
Yeah.

180
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,950
Alright.
So we won't advertise on TV anymore.

181
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Well I think there's maybe a better way 
would be to do it the way they do it in 

182
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,380
the movies where they show you the ads 
first.

183
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,640
Yeah.
And then the movie.

184
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:25,990
Yeah.
But you have to watch it.

185
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,670
That's the thing now.
But still,

186
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,370
it's like once the show begins,
you shut the fuck up.

187
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,150
You know when you go to the movies,
the conceded,

188
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,180
the you're conceding is it?
You give them money so they're only 

189
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,800
going to know you in the beginning and 
then they're gonna stop annoying you.

190
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,930
They're going to let the thing play out 
in its full form,

191
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:45,931
which is the most enjoyable way when you
appreciate any like a coca cola or any 

192
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:49,270
one of those people just stepped in and 
said,

193
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:51,940
listen,
we all know the TV shows are better when

194
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:53,560
you let them play from the beginning to 
end.

195
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:55,570
You don't want to interrupt him with 
commercial all the time.

196
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,060
How about we'll do this.
We'll advertise in the beginning.

197
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:00,400
Thank you very much.
I hope you enjoy our product.

198
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,350
Hope you enjoy this movie.
Bam.

199
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:04,330
Yeah.
That's how it's supposed to be.

200
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,670
They've got it nailed.
These movie guys.

201
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:07,330
Got It.
Nailed.

202
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,900
These TV guys are retarded.
It'd be putting shit on the middle of 

203
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:12,900
the fucking show.
Stupid.

204
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,690
It was.
Yeah,

205
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,160
and it was so bad last night that I was 
just like,

206
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:19,870
really?
This is getting an insane 15 minutes.

207
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,380
Come on.
It wasn't even 20 minutes.

208
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,330
Maybe.
Maybe every hour.

209
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:26,570
If you have a two hour show every hour.
Trolling a few commercials.

210
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,510
Fuck it.
It pretty much was one hour show,

211
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,420
one hour of commercials,
but they built it as a two hour event.

212
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,130
Yeah.
Well it's a lot of money,

213
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,210
man.
There's a lot of money.

214
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,540
I wasn't.
I really enjoyed the series up until 

215
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540
now,
but especially early on.

216
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,670
I'm a fellow is.
It's like a really creative series,

217
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,760
but I got to admit that last night just 
seemed kind of like hokey.

218
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,620
It's like,
you know,

219
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:53,710
the Chinese guy who doesn't like to a,
I don't want to say anything right now.

220
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,240
Yeah,
you

221
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,120
gotta just go replace everything that 
blah blah blah,

222
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:56,320
blah.

223
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,300
I'm not.
No,

224
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:02,301
no spoilers.
I don't want to give it away if you 

225
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:02,301
haven't seen it.
So,

226
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:02,800
uh,
that's what I think it's a,

227
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:06,150
it's still a great show still,
even though it seems Hokey,

228
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,250
it's still fun,
but at a certain point in time,

229
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:10,020
the whole premise is hokey.
I mean,

230
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:10,980
come on.
It's silly.

231
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,770
It's ridiculous.
It's the suspension of disbelief show.

232
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,300
Yeah.

233
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,000
Now when you jumping back in time with 
nuclear weapons,

234
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,170
like,
what the fuck are you doing?

235
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,470
You know what?
You can just hit that thing and you go 

236
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,470
back.

237
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,470
Oh,
okay,

238
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,470
cool.
No,

239
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,570
it's just utter nonsense.

240
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,850
It's like I want to talk about it,
but there's something I want to talk 

241
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:30,850
about it,
but I'm trying to censor it,

242
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,610
but I.
There's no way to do it.

243
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:33,330
Yeah.
You can't eat snacks.

244
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,000
Well,
how did you,

245
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,410
did you enjoy it?
Yeah,

246
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:41,411
I did.
I was so pissed off about the 

247
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:41,411
commercials that kind of upset me very 
upset.

248
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:43,020
I,
I like being in a rural road and imagine

249
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,490
watching Avatar and every five minutes 
you got to take commercial.

250
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:47,750
No,
you're absolutely right.

251
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:52,751
It's ridiculous.
There's got to be a better way to sell 

252
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:52,751
shit.
That's not the best way to sell shit.

253
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,350
That's stupid.
If they think that just by,

254
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:56,750
you know,
by conditioning people to be used to,

255
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,790
you know,
interrupting and over and over again 

256
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,840
that that's the best way.
Make us watch it in the beginning 

257
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:03,840
they're like,
well,

258
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:03,840
we're not gonna.
Watch it anyway.

259
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,291
Then you have a Webcam set up on top of 
your TV that detects if you're sitting 

260
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:08,291
there watching it.
You know,

261
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,460
people get excited for previews.
Man.

262
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,160
I get excited for the whole preview.
I don't know why,

263
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:18,310
but I get excited.
I'm more amped up to see the wolf man 

264
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,310
this year.
Then I think like anything,

265
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,820
man,
that looks awesome.

266
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,060
Can you do it?
That's going to be like in a gang sign,

267
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,260
dude,
do the wolf man.

268
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,350
It looks sick.
It looks cool because it's like old 

269
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:30,350
school.
The wolf man,

270
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,880
you know,
and Rick Baker did all the makeup.

271
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:36,480
He's that dude who did star wars and 
he's done like everything.

272
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:41,481
He did an American Werewolf in London 
and this is like real old school makeup,

273
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,140
you know,
it's not like Cgi,

274
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:46,320
like parts or CGI,
like the transformation that CGI when it

275
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:49,380
becomes the wolf man,
but then it's like a dude in an outfit,

276
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,440
you know,
and Rick Baker's the master.

277
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:57,441
That shit.
When I was a little kid I used to want 

278
00:13:57,441 --> 00:13:57,441
to be a makeup artist,

279
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:02,350
Hollywood guys that made the makeup of 
the guy on the hog video up there.

280
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,380
But I used to want to do like werewolf 
masks and Shit and like special effects 

281
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,380
movie,
special effects,

282
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,271
mass stuff.
I thought that was the coolest shit 

283
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:15,271
ever.
I wanted to do that for a while,

284
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,180
man.
I was a big fan of that guy.

285
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,340
Rick Baker.
He's the dude.

286
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,280
He's doing this movie too.
So that's what was going to be the shit.

287
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,510
It looks good.
Fucking del Toro's probably a part where

288
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:28,640
he sings like a wolf man song or 
something like that.

289
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,920
This fucking ass off that dude.
You know,

290
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,330
he's one of those dudes white when when 
he's playing like angry or crazy,

291
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,630
like he goes so far you would worry that
he's going to like,

292
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,270
you've worried he's going to do 
something fucking crazy,

293
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,640
you know?
Then when he's in a role,

294
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:47,090
he,
he,

295
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:52,091
he's one of those dudes.
It's like I always look forward to his 

296
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:52,091
movies,
like whatever is he knows how to

297
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,590
do it.
Acting such a tricky thing,

298
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,270
isn't it?
Like some actors,

299
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,190
you look really look forward to seeing 
them in movies,

300
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,800
you know?
Yeah,

301
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,880
definitely.
It's a weird thing now.

302
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,660
Sissy spacer.
Some dudes get like super obsessed with 

303
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,070
it.
How about those guys guys?

304
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,430
We're like super obsessed with movies,
movie trivia and Shit.

305
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,680
You know what's really gay?
Is that gross is that there's a John 

306
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,490
Travolta movie that's coming out where 
it's a love story and it uses a cross 

307
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:22,560
movie reference.
That's how bad it is.

308
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:27,561
He's like embarrassing goes.
I always like a royale with cheese and 

309
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:27,561
I'm like,
oh no.

310
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,410
Oh my God.
It was like John Travolta seems to be 

311
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,230
losing his mind.
I would love to talk to that.

312
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,150
How dare he ruined a character.
You didn't.

313
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,970
And you know what I mean.
He's ruined and then he's creating a new

314
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,950
one.
I don't think he's ruining it.

315
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,950
You can't ruin it.
What it is is a slice of time.

316
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,580
Now you go back and you could see it not
as gross as commercials to me.

317
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,140
Well,
he was good in that Pelham one,

318
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:51,010
two,
three movie.

319
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,190
If you didn't see that pal.
Who moving here was fucking good in it,

320
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:55,750
man.
He plays a good psycho

321
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,640
tape.
I didn't like.

322
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,920
Is the hurt locker?
Have you seen that?

323
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,200
I didn't see it.
Rent it on Amazon.

324
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,160
Already have it.
Oh,

325
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,830
you got it.
Everybody says it's the best movie ever.

326
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,810
It's so slow and boring.
It's like,

327
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,460
let's go to one mission anymore.
I don't know.

328
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,730
This is running.
Nothing.

329
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,400
Go to one mission to another mission.
Oh,

330
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,390
let's go to another mission.
That end.

331
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,110
It's like,
why am I watching this?

332
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,990
Like I felt like I was just

333
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,640
watching.
You know what?

334
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:22,340
I felt like that with no country for old
men.

335
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,480
Yeah.
I never saw that.

336
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,160
No country for old men.
I was like,

337
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,140
listen,
I know what you're trying to do.

338
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,830
I know you're trying to be crafty and I 
ain't trying to be unconventional,

339
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,730
but here's the deal.
When I go to movies,

340
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,100
I want you to stick with the fucking 
framework.

341
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:39,101
Okay?
Here's good guys and bad guys and maybe 

342
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:39,260
monsters.
Okay?

343
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:40,490
And at the end.
Good guys,

344
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:42,640
win any questions?
Okay.

345
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,290
Make your shit okay.
I like watching good guys.

346
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,420
When you fucking Weirdo.
I don't watch.

347
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't like watching people just drive 
off.

348
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,930
The whole thing is fake.
All right.

349
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,540
Are you pretending that?
Well,

350
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,030
in the real world,
things don't turn out well.

351
00:16:56,031 --> 00:17:01,031
This isn't the real world stupid.
This is a God damn fucking movie and I 

352
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:01,031
want a good ending.
Right?

353
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,510
I want an interesting ending with a 
fucking cunt

354
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,190
avatar.
Avatar.

355
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:09,191
I,
I've talked to so many people that have 

356
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:11,081
been in the military that are pissed off
at that movie for killing what they say 

357
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:14,951
represents US soldiers,
but yet nowhere in there did they say 

358
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:15,230
they're like us or anything.
They're just like an army,

359
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,570
you know?
That's a good point really,

360
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:18,910
when you think about it,
like,

361
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:24,210
well,
they're saying who are whatever that 

362
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:24,210
the,
the one guy was a marine,

363
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,070
but he was one of the blue guy.
I can see it,

364
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,900
I can see it,
but it's like,

365
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:27,800
all right dude,
calm down.

366
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:28,910
There's Smurfs,
you know?

367
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,060
Well that's this.
He's got a point,

368
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,590
man.
You could see it that way because you're

369
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,120
not a a military.
Right.

370
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,150
That's what I'm saying.
Especially a military person in the 

371
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,330
middle of two wars that they mean not 
support and there's a lot of people that

372
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:46,331
are,
that are in the military that don't 

373
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:46,580
think we should be there anymore.
A lot of people.

374
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,630
Yeah,
but I think Avatar in general is just 

375
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,561
like,
it was like Joe wasn't real us army 

376
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:53,561
troops,
you know,

377
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:54,450
there's no reason to get mad that 
they're just an army.

378
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,670
They're representing like a space army 
or something.

379
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,440
It was so much in the future.
It was like a thousand year old man.

380
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,660
It was to human life.
If you want to be real to me,

381
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,990
don't get mad at Predator.
Could you imagine though,

382
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,820
for Real,
if if

383
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,160
was such a planet and there was such a 
mineral and there were mercenaries who 

384
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,610
were going to that planet if it wasn't 
broadcast to us,

385
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,160
we don't know what the fuck is going on 
in Afghanistan every day.

386
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,430
We don't know about these crazy drones 
and they're firing missiles into 

387
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,821
Pakistan.
I mean this is real stuff that's on the 

388
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:31,821
news.
It seems like science fiction,

389
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:36,081
this is going on every day and other 
parts of the world and how ain't that 

390
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,860
much different men and ate that much 
different.

391
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,580
It's people that don't know people and 
people for their shit,

392
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,280
you know,
and that's what's going on right now and

393
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,450
that's what it was going on in the 
movie.

394
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,230
It's not that unrealistic,
you know?

395
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,300
And in fact it might be,
it might be generous.

396
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:54,390
The idea that they would go so far as to
make artificial ones,

397
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:59,391
to try to be friends with them really,
but more like kill them more like kill 

398
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,070
them.
I mean that's what people do mean.

399
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:06,960
That movie painted a much more,
a much brighter picture of humanity than

400
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,000
the real humanity.
The real humanity,

401
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:14,001
we're not making like Arab clones and 
we're operating with remote control to 

402
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:16,170
go in and infiltrate the Taliban and go,
hey guys,

403
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,350
what's wrong with being American?
We could,

404
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,160
maybe we can all be cool.
You know,

405
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,280
you know,
I mean if the United States government

406
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,020
had that kind of insight and innovation 
into the human body,

407
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,030
could you imagine that kind of shit that
they would do?

408
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:36,810
They would just make billions and 
billions of Republicans that would just 

409
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,201
start cloning Republicans and making 
them and operating them with a remote 

410
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:44,761
control republican girls fucking all the
important guys getting all their deals 

411
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,080
past just.
They'll do.

412
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,980
You're just shaking your robot girl.

413
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,790
That's,
that's an Avatar for the real life if 

414
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:57,790
that.
If they.

415
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,530
We don't,
we're not that Nice,

416
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,190
okay,
we're not going to make fake Arabs were.

417
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,320
No,
that's not gonna happen or fake whoever 

418
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,691
the fuck we're fighting.
We're going to figure out a reason to 

419
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:12,301
convince everybody on this side that 
those people are evil and that's what 

420
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:16,171
we've always done.
Those people are evil and then we jack 

421
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:16,171
them.
You know?

422
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,300
I mean,
it's,

423
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,330
it's fucking amazing that the same game 
can go on for so long and in this age of

424
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:25,470
information it can still be passed off 
as like,

425
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,460
you know,
as the important thing to do.

426
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,310
You know,
the important thing to do at a certain 

427
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,990
point is to try to fucking help 
everybody try to get all these countries

428
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:39,640
to chill the fuck out.
But that's never gonna happen man,

429
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,260
because they live in somewhere that 
sucks.

430
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,210
And when you live somewhere that really 
sucks.

431
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:45,280
There's a lot of Goddamn conflict,
you know,

432
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,310
that's just a fact.
They got a fucking roll the dice and 

433
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,001
they're living in a part of the world 
that stuck hundreds and hundreds of 

434
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:58,621
years ago.
They've got technology but they've got 

435
00:20:58,621 --> 00:20:59,610
chaos and you know,
it doesn't,

436
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,110
it's just a mess.
They've been fighting forever.

437
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,760
They've been fighting forever over 
there,

438
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:05,620
man.
I mean that's what they do.

439
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,460
That's what these fucking people do in 
the Middle East.

440
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:11,410
War has been going on in the Middle East
for so long.

441
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Like you talked to Israelis,
like due to a live in Israel already 

442
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,820
talks about all the time.
Those motherfuckers are hard,

443
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,830
you know,
those people are different,

444
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,510
you know,
those,

445
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:24,730
those people were experiencing war on a,
on a daily basis.

446
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:29,731
Man,
that's like a part of their culture 

447
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:29,731
almost,
you know,

448
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:33,541
it's like this conflict has been going 
on for so fucking long over there and 

449
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,870
it's almost impossible to see a way 
without evolving,

450
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,580
without evolving as a species.

451
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,440
It's almost impossible to see a way it's
going to end.

452
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:44,890
It just keeps going.
It doesn't show any sign of letting up.

453
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,610
You know,
if you looked at it as a,

454
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,770
you know,
as a wave,

455
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,950
you know,
and you see the wave bouncing back and 

456
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,950
forth.
Like what?

457
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,900
It doesn't seem like it's gone away.
It seems like there's always some 

458
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,460
bullshit going down.
There's always this motherfuckers mad at

459
00:21:57,461 --> 00:22:00,640
that motherfucker and he's gonna launch 
bombs and dented the.

460
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,940
It just,
it,

461
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:05,500
it seems like it takes a little time off
and then it bounces right back in.

462
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:08,040
Palestine wants their land back and 
tipped it to an,

463
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,520
a settler as an oh shit.
Someone got run over by a tank to to,

464
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,050
to,
to,

465
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,780
you know,
it's like,

466
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,180
it's always there this spring backing 
forth.

467
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:21,181
Violent tension is always there and it's
like something's gotta be done at the 

468
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,680
core of that shit.
Something's gotta be done.

469
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,740
Unless you're.
I mean,

470
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,930
unless that's what people really want.
Once people what they really want,

471
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,360
it's conflict lumens.
That's just human nature.

472
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,050
You know?

473
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,040
It's possible,
right?

474
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,990
So avatar is nicer than people 
advertise,

475
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:46,870
nicer than people I think.
I don't think we would make fake people 

476
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,870
to deal with our animals.
We would fucking kill him.

477
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,760
So for people that say that,
that's.

478
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,480
Oh,
you moved pitch people in bird load

479
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,730
mercenaries,
man.

480
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,860
That's,
that's crazy job.

481
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:59,080
Those kinds of space mercenaries.
Motherfucker,

482
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,570
don't you play doom,
right?

483
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,680
Those dudes are serious space 
mercenaries.

484
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,030
That's an excellent character.
If you're playing quake three,

485
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,750
you know,
it'd be a space marine.

486
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,670
Fuck you bitch.
Tough characters.

487
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,060
So I have an eight year old pole that 
was revisited recently.

488
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,830
It was about pooping poop.
Standing or sitting or wiping.

489
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,560
It's pretty funny though.
It's gained popularity.

490
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:31,200
Again,
wipe,

491
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,210
standing up or sitting down.
What do you know how a white 

492
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:36,210
motherfucker,
we've talked about this.

493
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,711
I know we've talked on this.
W O W I stand up to get a good goddamn 

494
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,430
white bed.
I'll tell you this,

495
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:45,470
I was using those flushable wipes,
you know,

496
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,210
to keep my button

497
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,490
nice and fresh and tidy.
You got 50,

498
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,910
58.
Those aren't good man.

499
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
Fifty slash 50.
No,

500
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,180
no,
no,

501
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,190
no.
Even if 50 slash 50 that the problem 

502
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,190
with those wipes is can't really flush 
them.

503
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,810
They call them fly and bone,
but I've added to my house twice.

504
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:02,900
That's how stupid bitches.
The pack up in your pipes.

505
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,700
You can't flush them.
You know?

506
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,550
How many are you using?
Like 15 to Russia.

507
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,520
But you can do that.
So then the only other option is you 

508
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,690
have to either have a bad day,
which I have never used.

509
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Why don't you use it?
I would totally love one because I'm an 

510
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,530
American.
I think it's great.

511
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,820
It's like,
Hey American,

512
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:27,821
I want to force it up my butt hole.
It doesn't even look remotely 

513
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:28,250
comfortable or inviting fracture so 
hard.

514
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:30,650
Whoever the fuck invented that,
that asked me to machine.

515
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,880
They're hard people,
man,

516
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,070
because that thing is just like 
polished.

517
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,440
It's white and there's like steel and 
chrome.

518
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:40,610
It doesn't look like anywhere.
You want to put your asshole really warm

519
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,890
and soft and inviting.
Police your asshole here.

520
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:46,390
We'll clean it off for you know,
it looks like metal and fucking.

521
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:51,430
It's 2010.
If you need a better way to clean my 

522
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,540
asshole with a machine and this stupid 
little monster looking thing.

523
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,960
It looks like a torture contraption.
It looks like a faucet and looks like 

524
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,010
someone's going to shut that other stick
right up your asshole and you turn it on

525
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:02,810
and water goes inside your body or 
something.

526
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,840
I mean that's what it looks like.
It's just make like a robot Asian face 

527
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,730
head that just eats your ass.
I can pick her up.

528
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,920
He was like leaning against it and he's 
like,

529
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:17,921
yeah,
clean it because it looks like Lucy Lu.

530
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,870
What about for you?
What about for girls though?

531
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:25,871
We need something for girls.
Wouldn't be a black guy with the same 

532
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:29,100
one that cleans her husband's asshole.
I guarantee if there was an asshole 

533
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,110
cleaning machine and it was a woman's 
face like a really hot Asian woman,

534
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,250
will your wife would want her own 
asshole cleaning machine right next to 

535
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,190
magic Johnson or you send a picture,
a photo to the manufacturer over father 

536
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:48,860
and they send back the father.
Imagine if you could do that.

537
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:53,861
I mean,
why can't you do that soon in the 

538
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:55,511
future?
I guarantee you in the future there's 

539
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:55,511
going to be toilet seat that looked like
celebrities.

540
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,880
They can eat your ass hole.
Julia Roberts.

541
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:04,210
Look,
somebody's twitter this down that this 

542
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,370
is the future because we're going to 
forget this.

543
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:10,570
Twitter me this please toilet seats.
They look like celebrities and they 

544
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,190
clean your asshole that that is the 
future.

545
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,210
Genetic like fake leg.
They're so close to like replicating 

546
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,000
different parts of human beings.
You know they.

547
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,030
They created a woman's bladder,
took her bladder and they've used stem 

548
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,560
cells and they created.
They took a piece of her bladder.

549
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:28,700
They created a big bladder for her,
were doing do incredible things.

550
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:31,340
Now that's going to be a.
that's going to be able to happen.

551
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,990
You're going to have to be able to have 
puff Daddy,

552
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,860
right?
Your asshole.

553
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,780
It's gonna look like,
like those wax figures,

554
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:40,781
like that's famous.
It's gonna feel like flash and they're 

555
00:26:40,781 --> 00:26:42,630
going to have emotions and all he wants 
to do is lick your asshole.

556
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,130
That's it.
But yeah,

557
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,360
but they have emotions.
Sometimes they would cry and be sad when

558
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:52,040
I think Julia Roberts face going.
No,

559
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,990
no,
no.

560
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,330
Who would you have if you had,
if you have the ability to buy any 

561
00:26:59,330 --> 00:26:59,330
celebrity.
Megan Fox,

562
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,310
Megan Fox News.
But as a gag gift I would get my friends

563
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:02,670
like,
Hey,

564
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:03,600
I got your uh,
Brad Pitt.

565
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,080
Be Brutal though.
If like,

566
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,580
what if your friends really liked.
It's not even a real person bro.

567
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,460
Fuck.
I want my asshole clean.

568
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,820
I liked,
I liked it.

569
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,570
What do you give a shit?
It's not even a real guy because it's 

570
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,370
the guy's image because image,
images eat your ass.

571
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,140
Who would you do?
I don't know man.

572
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,810
I have to think about that.
I would go right from Megan Fox,

573
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,580
but I would also have like a,
like,

574
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,650
like a different one for special 
occasion.

575
00:27:27,651 --> 00:27:32,651
Maybe I'd go with like Traci Lords right
when she became legal chapman.

576
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:43,060
It's like Tracy Chapman,
Tracy Lawrence.

577
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,560
Because like the craziest porno story 
ever.

578
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,590
You know that story.
I was thinking a divided lims player 

579
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:50,590
from Mathis.

580
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:50,590
I met her.
Oh No.

581
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,370
Oh,
vh one thing.

582
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,810
One of those,
uh,

583
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,490
like uh,
they did a bunch of shows called the 

584
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,100
list and I got to sit down with a rob 
Halford from Judas priest.

585
00:28:00,101 --> 00:28:05,101
He was one of the guests.
Meatloaf was one of the guests and I 

586
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,970
hosted it and she was on a tour.
She was one of the guys.

587
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:08,130
She was very nice,
very.

588
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,380
She seems like an like a normal human,
but she was so super hot man when she 

589
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,910
was young.
Who?

590
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,660
Not that she's not super on now.
It's pretty hard now,

591
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:21,661
but God damn,
when she was young it was just 

592
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:21,661
ridiculous.
She got into porn at like 16.

593
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:23,560
Lied about her age.
They're all illegal.

594
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,500
Yeah.
I've never seen one on my computer ever.

595
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,590
Yeah,
I mean it should be illegal.

596
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,390
I totally understand.
I'm with you.

597
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,730
I know there's plenty of porn.
It's so funny.

598
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:37,820
Back then though,
the seventies looked like an old lady,

599
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,560
you know,
like,

600
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,940
like I,
you look back at 70 videos.

601
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,330
Those kids don't look like kids.
They look like older women like cougars.

602
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:47,510
Here's something that I really like.
Your hair and your makeup.

603
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,010
They did dress crazy,
but it's so fascinating,

604
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:54,490
man.
Those whole pawns are fascinating.

605
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,280
Know Donna,
you liked that one?

606
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,570
I like her.
She's,

607
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,250
she's always favorite too,
I think.

608
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,650
Yeah.
I just like her because she's like real.

609
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,790
It's like,
hey look,

610
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,430
here's a picture of my butthole.
Very real.

611
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,400
She'll shock you with her.
Yeah,

612
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,960
she's got great twitter's.
If you don't follow her,

613
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:16,961
it's not safe for work.
And you click on it and it's a gaping 

614
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:20,080
butthole with.
Yeah.

615
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,900
Kind of like,
yeah,

616
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:24,510
that's kind of not safe for work.
Talk about,

617
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,670
you know,
the understatement of the year award.

618
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,990
Okay,
hold on.

619
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:30,890
If you don't want to see a gaping 
butthole dog,

620
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,970
God dot.
It's funny because she was doing an 

621
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,600
asshole movie and she was like 
practicing all week.

622
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,480
He's like,
I got to practice more like a fist up or

623
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,160
God bless

624
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,990
her.
God bless you girl.

625
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,350
Keep going with it.
Enjoy.

626
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,730
So a three d porn coming soon.
It is coming soon,

627
00:29:52,731 --> 00:29:54,350
man.
I was at the uh,

628
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:57,240
the Sony store,
the Sony store at the mall and they have

629
00:29:57,241 --> 00:30:02,241
the three d tv and you put glasses on 
and you turn them on with a button and 

630
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,520
it's just like watching anime tie three 
dates.

631
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,940
Fucking insane.
They had sports on.

632
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,230
I had soccer and the soccer balls 
fucking flying by you.

633
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:16,280
I mean it's really wicked.
It just like so much more immersive.

634
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,660
It's really,
really cool.

635
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,670
And that's going to be on TV soon,
man.

636
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,850
It's coming out this summer in 2010.
They're going to have the first units 

637
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,640
out and then it's going to just explode 
so crazy.

638
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,370
They're going to be filming in three 
days.

639
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,970
Everything.
Everything's going to be in three d.

640
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,190
yeah.
I got something to add to the old crop 

641
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,190
dusting theory.
I was thinking of this the other day.

642
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,880
It was like the crop dusting pot on 
people.

643
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,750
No,
no.

644
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,740
I mean Shit.
Kim Trail.

645
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,270
That's something I did the whole Kim 
trails discussing.

646
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,850
I thought of you better night.
So if you're going to do like spray this

647
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:52,851
shit over cities,
we know where people are going to be 

648
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:52,851
like,
what the fuck is that?

649
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,960
Why don't you do it at night?
Yes.

650
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,950
Hey,
should we do it when everyone can see it

651
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,680
in is awake or should we do at three in 
the morning?

652
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,690
That's part of the eval or well-planned.
The evil plan is that they sprayed right

653
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:08,650
above them.
They willingly,

654
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,890
you know,
allowed these politicians to control 

655
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:13,930
them with the spray in the sky.
You know,

656
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:14,800
who really,
really,

657
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:18,850
really believes that shit is prince 
prince is like crazy.

658
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:20,560
But chem trails,
he was like,

659
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,060
you know,
so crazy.

660
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,300
We would all be in the ghetto and 
everybody would be playing and having a 

661
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,180
good time.
And then they'd start spraying that shit

662
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:31,450
over our heads and all of a sudden 
everybody was fighting like,

663
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:33,280
why are we fighting?
What's it about?

664
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:36,640
Like what the fuck are you talking 
about?

665
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,710
All right.
People always fight.

666
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:41,260
There's always violence.
Like what are you insane?

667
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,690
Any place where people are poor,
people are violent.

668
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,750
Shut the fuck up.
Like you really think that they're 

669
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,220
spraying shit from the sky that's making
people in poor communities be violent.

670
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,360
Wowza people believe some nasty shit.

671
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,120
Can you imagine being stuck in an 
elevator with prints that would be.

672
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,960
Love it for that.
He's a genius.

673
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,390
She to just be in that guy's presence 
and just talk to him.

674
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,730
A fascinating dude,
but sometimes even dudes who are 

675
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,230
geniuses at anything,
whether it's playing chess or you know,

676
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:17,231
being a martial artist,
there's sometimes there's something 

677
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:20,351
wrong with them to get them there.
There's something about getting really 

678
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,120
amazing at something.
People that are the very,

679
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:26,480
very best at something who almost all 
crazy.

680
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,730
It's really hard not to be,
you know?

681
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,870
Could you imagine if you like the best 
in the world?

682
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:34,940
Like a Lance Armstrong type dude?
How's that?

683
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:36,110
Do not fucking crazy.

684
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,290
It is.
Pancakes.

685
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,580
Pancakes was on about waking up in the 
morning making a difference.

686
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,570
Kicks.
Oh,

687
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:48,290
that story.
Yeah.

688
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:53,291
I can't tell you a personal story.
Ladies and gentlemen.

689
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:57,200
I protect my friends.
Who was Joe Rogan?

690
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,430
Who are you,
man?

691
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,640
How Dan Jones home?
I was thinking deep thinking deep being 

692
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,900
mean to me.
Yeah.

693
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:13,901
But if he has,
if he to be asked that same question to 

694
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:15,530
John Malcovich,
you'd be like,

695
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,120
who is John Malcovich?
I'll tell you,

696
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,740
you know,
like,

697
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,360
you really look at that different 
products.

698
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,920
We boot this up,
my shit is whack.

699
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,480
How awesome is that?
Uh,

700
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:31,200
Dana White's playing or the pride shit 
on spite of so much.

701
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,160
Awesome man.
I've been addicted to it.

702
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,950
There is so much fun.
I showed Brian the,

703
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:41,951
uh,
the difference between the rules Brian 

704
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:46,601
was alive,
talked about in my blog where when the 

705
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:46,601
dude tried to stomp the dude,
he went,

706
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:46,601
he could do that.

707
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,080
You remember?
Yeah.

708
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:53,110
I was really stoned.
And next thing I know this guy is like 

709
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,330
stopping this guy's brain.
And I'm like,

710
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:53,800
Whoa,
whoa.

711
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,850
Is he trying to kill the guy?
Fucked up.

712
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,400
It was pretty fucked up.
It's like when you watch those,

713
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:59,960
uh,
those pride fights,

714
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,870
like they were pretty fucked up.
You know,

715
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,930
it's like old school,
UFC.

716
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,940
ECI.
Yeah.

717
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,130
But you know,
there's something about the way they did

718
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:07,490
it.
Man.

719
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:12,491
I like it.
I love the fact that they did 10 minute 

720
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:12,491
rounds.
The first round was cold.

721
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:13,400
That's great.
That's how it should be.

722
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,180
Yeah.
Well,

723
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:19,270
you know,
and everybody says no bullshit because 

724
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,390
it's too hard in the fighters.
I don't necessarily know if that's true.

725
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,440
You know,
there's a lot of times where a momentum 

726
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,551
is being established and it's been 
established and you would like to see 

727
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:27,551
where it goes.

728
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:29,810
You don't want to see him like fuel up 
and have some water in the corner.

729
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:31,760
I want to see where it goes from there.
From there,

730
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,090
have a dude works for like four minutes 
and finally gets out of the ground.

731
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,180
Or if a guy gets taken out immediately 
and a dude finally gets up and there's 

732
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,871
only 20 seconds left and then the dude 
starts bombing on him and then the guy 

733
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:46,781
who took him down as tired,
I want to see what the fuck is 

734
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:46,781
happening.
Keep going.

735
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:46,781
You know?
I mean,

736
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:48,020
that's what I think.
That's what the best guys would want.

737
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:53,021
The best guys would want to see that 
they would want to see a big ass 10 

738
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:56,321
minute round,
but he put it in the interest of the 

739
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:59,171
safety of the fighters though they're 
going to take less damage than a five 

740
00:34:59,171 --> 00:34:59,171
minute round.

741
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:02,200
That's why I accepted.
I accepted unified rules because if you 

742
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,721
look at it like in terms of like what's 
what's going to be the most palatable 

743
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:06,350
for the American people for the American
public.

744
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:11,351
Yeah.
That's the most palatable five minute 

745
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:11,351
rounds,
five rounds for championship fights.

746
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:15,491
I totally agree with all that stuff.
The only thing sometimes I think that I 

747
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:17,540
would substitute knees on the ground for
elbows,

748
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,780
I think needs from that position when 
you're holding onto a guy and you can 

749
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,810
name and the face,
elbows on the ground,

750
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:27,680
cut that shit out to dudes and sometimes
they fuck up fights,

751
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,210
you know,
they,

752
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:28,720
they,
they,

753
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,790
they'll end a fight early.
That was like a really good fight and 

754
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:33,790
it's because of a cut and they usually.
That doesn't happen,

755
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,380
but occasionally,
you know,

756
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,070
the UFC is so much better about that 
than

757
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,860
boxing the.
Any,

758
00:35:38,861 --> 00:35:41,430
any kind of a bad cut and they'll stop 
the fight like right away,

759
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,690
UFC lit Stephan struve fight and he had 
like a hatchet wound in his head.

760
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,050
I mean it was a giant cut.
It was a giant cut and then led the 

761
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,981
fight,
go and eventually got the dude down and 

762
00:35:54,981 --> 00:35:54,981
choked him out.
And it was an incredible fight.

763
00:35:54,981 --> 00:35:57,420
I mean he was busted wide open,
covered with blood.

764
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,670
It was insane.
And after it was over,

765
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,620
the guy was so dizzy,
he had lost so much blood,

766
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,070
he could barely talk to me and I was 
talking to him after the fight.

767
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,120
It was incredible though.
They would never let that happen in a 

768
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,291
boxing match.
I think it was kind of crazy that that 

769
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:16,401
fight took place in Germany because the 
Germans were kind of reluctant to have 

770
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:17,160
the UFC there.

771
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,550
And then I was like thinking like,
wow,

772
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,330
this is one of the bloodiest fights ever
and you know,

773
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:28,770
this is where it's going to take place.
And that place where they were 

774
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:28,770
apprehensive about it,
you know,

775
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,370
apparently a bunch of German dudes came 
down to see the UFC.

776
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,430
And I'm in Vegas and you know,
they didn't like it.

777
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,310
They thought it was horrific and 
violent.

778
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,860
What's kind of like pink spinning with 
the water?

779
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,940
You see that on the grammy's that,
that girl is so talented.

780
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:48,090
That's pretty amazing though.
She's very talented and she something 

781
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,090
about her,
her,

782
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,690
her performance charisma.
Like when she walks on stage it's like 

783
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,950
you have to like step back,
you know,

784
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,570
she's got it.
Whatever it is,

785
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,820
she's got it,
she's hot.

786
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,420
She's,
she's like,

787
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,260
there's something about just the way 
that she just walks on stage and sings 

788
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,570
so confidently and so commonly like her 
energy.

789
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,600
It's like that's a girl that's like born
to perform.

790
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,240
That bitch can perform her fucking ass 
off.

791
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:15,220
And when and then when she goes up in 
the air,

792
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:20,221
you're going to go,
oh well the other ones are going to do 

793
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:20,221
the acrobatic.
She ain't gonna do shit.

794
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:21,160
She's just kinda like get lifted up.
No,

795
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,220
she gets all fucking crazy and she's 
looking in this half naked outfit and 

796
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,330
she dumped in one arm.
She's spinning around and then she turns

797
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:28,610
up,
she,

798
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:32,170
she spinning with her head down and 
she's singing at the same time.

799
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,530
That's,
that's the baddest bitch and music 

800
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:37,530
period.
Everybody else.

801
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,470
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up,

802
00:37:38,471 --> 00:37:41,530
man.
Pink just owned all those bitches.

803
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,490
All of them.
Lady.

804
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:45,160
God got sit the fuck down.
But did you not see what happened?

805
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:47,740
Can you do that if you can't Shop Lady 
Gaga?

806
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,120
It was pretty good too.
I didn't see it.

807
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,290
That fucking poker face song made me 
want to punch holes through walls.

808
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,110
I like leading.
I like it all.

809
00:37:56,111 --> 00:38:00,810
You Want Fella?
Busy man.

810
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,210
I love.
I love chick songs.

811
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,030
I love when chick saying people get in 
my car and the thick.

812
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:07,990
It's a joke,
dude.

813
00:38:07,991 --> 00:38:12,991
You got to get this us CD tieger APP.
Let me think.

814
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,320
Maybe I told you already.
Tig Rue twitter recently.

815
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,410
They've fucking jam man.
You know punk checks puncture?

816
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,640
Yeah,
I'll do it.

817
00:38:24,641 --> 00:38:25,450
I'm all over that.

818
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,520
I love chicks with great voices.
Like people get in my car and like I 

819
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,090
have sheryl crow on and they would think
it was a joke.

820
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,180
Like what are you joking like that?
I like the long.

821
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,420
That's good cd.
It is her voice,

822
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,920
her voice is like comforting.
You know,

823
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,980
her voice makes me want to like,
feel like you're going to cuddle up in 

824
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,561
the corner of the fire ceremony locking.
She's given you a big hug with her 

825
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:49,870
voice.

826
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,000
No,

827
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,240
it's French for breeders.
The breeders remember them.

828
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,530
There were lines that sing a big song in
nineties,

829
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,710
uh,
mean splashed

830
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,000
turner and every man in our banner 
banner,

831
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,650
they were like big and then they just 
went away.

832
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,250
Yeah,
I think it's really hard to keep a 

833
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:17,250
musical band together.
You know,

834
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,320
I know Eddie has a hard time,
like keeping,

835
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:25,350
like he's,
he does a bunch of different projects 

836
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,421
all at the same time,
so it doesn't ever has to rely on any 

837
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:27,421
one person.
Right.

838
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:31,710
And he runs all of them.
It's got to be super hard to keep a 

839
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,000
bunch of people who are like wanting to 
be stars and you know,

840
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:39,001
wanting to just can't wait to get rich 
and get nutty and fucking lose their 

841
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,420
marbles and think that they're the 
reason why this bands there in the first

842
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,730
place and how many arguments like that 
happen in bands,

843
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,160
you know,
they're all nuts.

844
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:46,510
They're all wanting to want to be the 
outfit.

845
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,940
So very rare that a band like can 
really,

846
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,230
you know,
like foo fighters,

847
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:53,170
band or something like that could really
come together and just be that she's bad

848
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:58,171
ass band and keep it together and make 
good music so hard.

849
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,210
You know,
it seems like bands,

850
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:06,211
bands are good for like,
they're good for like a couple of cds 

851
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:09,690
and then it just gets rough for,
for most of all the rare few can just 

852
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,390
keep jamming on,
you know,

853
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:15,570
the rare few,
like the rolling stones just keep it 

854
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:15,570
together forever.
That's nuts.

855
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,270
No,

856
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,180
like they don't go out.
Like the crazy thing about the rolling 

857
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,000
stones is they're calling out like a 
young rock band.

858
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,790
Like they,
they,

859
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,110
they fucking,
you know,

860
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,640
Mick Jagger still bounced around on 
stage and yelling and shit.

861
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,700
Like he's in incredible shape,
you know?

862
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,920
That's that,
that's the amazing thing about how the 

863
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:36,920
stones are doing it.
It's not like he's just,

864
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,830
you know,
decided in his later years,

865
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:43,620
he just gonna stand there and sing the 
song still fucking running around and he

866
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:46,850
still takes his shirt off and shit and 
least it looks like a monster,

867
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,630
you know,

868
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:52,830
looks like a bunch of Nice.
He just glued a bunch of Nice Lotion in 

869
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:58,090
the basket.
Guy made a hilarious,

870
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,600
but he's got like a six pack and shit.
The dude has to be in insane shape to do

871
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:06,040
that act that says that's incredible

872
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,830
men.
Mick Jagger still keeping it out there.

873
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,770
Yeah.
So his,

874
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:12,710
uh,
what's his name?

875
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,570
Springsteen and all those guys.
Yeah.

876
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,650
Yeah.
He's still out there doing crazy for our

877
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:24,010
concerts and shit.
You know what man?

878
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,310
Those guys have people that have them.
There's people,

879
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:32,340
there's people that have fans.
And then there's people like Bruce 

880
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,731
springsteen that have people that 
worship him and live for the fact that 

881
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:40,541
Bruce springsteen is alive and their 
whole day revolves around springsteen 

882
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:44,830
and they probably post on a message 
board some there somewhere and their 

883
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:48,161
message board name.
It's probably like be springsteen or 

884
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:48,161
something like that.
You know what I'm saying?

885
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:52,210
Or some obscure nicknamed that they know
that Bruce springsteen had when he was 

886
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,230
younger that they dropped after awhile.
You know what I'm saying?

887
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,230
You know the fucking,
the Long Island Expressway,

888
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:58,270
whatever the fuck it would be.
You know,

889
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,890
whenever they were calling people get 
nutty,

890
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:01,250
mad.

891
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,860
You know,
people get nerdy about people.

892
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:06,470
Especially Jersey guys.
He's from Jersey.

893
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,390
Bruce Springsteen,
he's from Jersey City,

894
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,610
New Jersey and Jersey.
They get fucking crazy.

895
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,700
People are so crazy.
They're savages.

896
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,330
They are savages.
That's why I was born by the way,

897
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,410
don't get angry.
I'm talking about me.

898
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,100
I just saw a kitchen nightmares that was
in Jersey and it's like the whole family

899
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:25,370
was just out of out of their mind.
There are some of the toughest guys that

900
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:28,340
fight in the UFC or from church.
Frankie Edgar,

901
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:29,900
Jim Miller,
Dan Miller,

902
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,840
those guys are all Jersey guys.
They're fucking savages there.

903
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:36,200
Are there different kinds of dudes?
They will fight you.

904
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,910
They will fucking punch you in the head.
It's like this.

905
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,960
It's a totally different type of human 
being than like the average dude that 

906
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,150
grows up.
Like in California.

907
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,400
People are so much more relaxed in 
California,

908
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,380
so much friendlier,
so much nicer.

909
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,810
Jersey people will punch you in your 
fucking head.

910
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,970
It's not all of them,
you know,

911
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,860
and they're not bad guys.
They're not.

912
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,600
They're not mean.
They're just.

913
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:59,780
There's a level of tension in certain 
towns.

914
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,300
Philly's another one.
There's a level of tension and Philly,

915
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,820
you know,
that the dudes would come out of.

916
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:08,480
There are so many bad assets come out of
Philadelphia.

917
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,970
Boxers.
Joe Frazier came out of Philadelphia.

918
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:15,971
Bernard Hopkins came out of Philadelphia
and MMA got Eddie Alvarez comes out of 

919
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:17,830
Philadelphia and Philadelphia is filled 
with fucking and nimbles.

920
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,630
You know,
that's a crazy ass tough town.

921
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:25,810
It's weird how there's towns like that 
is that there's certain towns that just 

922
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:25,940
have like,
like,

923
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
you know,
no one thinks of like San Francisco is 

924
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,000
being like aggressive.
You know what I'm saying?

925
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,170
Like it's like that's like kind of a 
relaxed town.

926
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,690
You'd almost feel like if you got mugged
in San Francisco,

927
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:37,160
you're a pussy,
but no,

928
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,230
there's like regular people in San 
Francisco.

929
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,510
There's violence there to but some 
places is just way more violent.

930
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:44,990
Right.
Columbus,

931
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:46,250
you grew up in Columbus,
Ohio.

932
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,910
Was that don't get tense in the winter?
No,

933
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:52,730
not really,
but the worst is I like Cleveland,

934
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:58,150
Cleveland's getting bad,
but Michigan driving through Michigan 

935
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,360
and go to the casinos.
That was scary.

936
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,600
Like cars on fire and houses.
They got bears walking through Detroit.

937
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,940
They're spotted bears in the city of 
Detroit.

938
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:07,970
There's so many abandoned houses that 
bears are starting to move back around.

939
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:09,520
That's nuts.
Yep.

940
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,870
Bears in Detroit.
Wow.

941
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,690
That's spooky shit,
man.

942
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:18,700
That's like one of my bits really is.
That's like the the bed I have about 

943
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,250
the,
the,

944
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,800
the dumb people out bringing smart 
people,

945
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:26,801
smart people die off and everything 
shuts down and then the dumb people are 

946
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:27,320
stuck there,
but in this case it's poor,

947
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:30,140
unfortunate people that were actually 
born in this one town.

948
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,190
It's happening.
So you know,

949
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:37,191
Detroit is falling apart like this 
insane rate and it's not getting any 

950
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:41,541
better.
It's like they say that it's over 50 

951
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:43,410
percent joblessness in Detroit because 
they report like 20 something percent,

952
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:45,510
but the rest of them are just people who
have stopped.

953
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:48,630
They stopped counting them after a year.
It's crazy,

954
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:50,430
man.
Scary.

955
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,640
You know,
we used to make the coolest fucking cars

956
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,540
ever.
If you compare just on a coolest factor,

957
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,930
like some of the cars that America is 
making in like 1969 and then like Alpha 

958
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,580
Male,
those gay looking pieces of shit,

959
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,790
those goofy looking clump boxes take a 
19,

960
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:11,940
67 corvette over all those bitches.
You know,

961
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:14,670
America is making so radical fucking 
cars,

962
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,010
man.
60 seven vet,

963
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,930
69 Camaro.

964
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,910
Pretty good.
Pretty good.

965
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:25,911
Cars are starting to a jk just got news 
today that she has two recalls on our 

966
00:45:25,911 --> 00:45:27,780
Toyota and she's like,
Holy Shit,

967
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:29,730
I have one of these cars,
and she's like,

968
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:31,260
what am I supposed to do?
And they're like,

969
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:31,950
oh,
well,

970
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:33,360
you know,
just drive careful.

971
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:35,940
And uh,
she's like,

972
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,370
whoa.
Have you heard that gets stuck on.

973
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,810
No,
they're not even saying that.

974
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:44,811
There's some people that are saying that
whatever programming is a Steve Wasniak 

975
00:45:44,811 --> 00:45:47,490
I said that he's figured out that it's a
software error.

976
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,050
Omar.
And so now we're thinking,

977
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:53,240
wait our cars to go crazy over software.
Now you got,

978
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,680
you got pc in your car,
now it's got a virus,

979
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:57,780
and now I can control your car and lock 
the doors.

980
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,210
Oh my God,
I didn't even think about that.

981
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:04,680
Somebody can bluetooth your fucking and 
it hack your car right next to you.

982
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:09,860
They can hack your car,
lock the doors like mission impossible 

983
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:09,960
style on the breaks.
Yeah.

984
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,330
I wonder what the fuck they can do to 
stop shit like that from happening.

985
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,660
That's craziness.
I didn't even think about that.

986
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:20,661
And did you hear that nine one,
one call of the people that were in one 

987
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:22,140
of the cars that led to the recall,
there's a nine one,

988
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:24,090
one call that you can listen to where 
the guy's like,

989
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,650
hi,
we're going to have three words.

990
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,260
We're going to be at 120.
Our brakes aren't working.

991
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:29,610
We can't turn off the car.
And we're.

992
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,620
And we're,
we're going towards the end of the 

993
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:34,620
freeway and we're,
we're,

994
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,590
we're going through an intersection like
family of four,

995
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,640
something like that.
It's awful.

996
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:44,150
All because of this Toyota Bullshit.
I don't even want to hear about this 

997
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:44,150
one.
Yeah,

998
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,460
that's scary as fuck man.
Check out google a nine slash 11.

999
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:48,960
Call Toyota.
Recall

1000
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,100
Jesus.
Well,

1001
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:54,200
I have Alexis.
Alexis has made by

1002
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:59,470
right?
I think actually it wasn't lexis that 

1003
00:46:59,470 --> 00:46:59,470
have you checked to see cars on a recall
list?

1004
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:00,480
No.
You better do it right now.

1005
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,510
Jessica just did it today to two recalls
on her car.

1006
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,940
Get the fuck.
I swear to God.

1007
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,990
Doing it with.
And Alexis was the one that was now 

1008
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:09,990
correct.
So yeah,

1009
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,960
I'm pretty sure here.
Let's Google that.

1010
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,140
Alexis,
nine one one call

1011
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,910
toilet lexis.
It's a matte recall.

1012
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:24,970
It's a mat.
They're not saying anything about a 

1013
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:24,970
software software

1014
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:24,970
thing.
No.

1015
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,530
Steve Wasniak the lake.
We're wozniaks said doubt about it.

1016
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,560
It was on in gadget yesterday.
Let's,

1017
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:30,190
um,
let's

1018
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,620
post it up for people because this is 
kind of important.

1019
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,730
Otherwise we can get in trouble,
right?

1020
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,920
Not really,
but he said that if he didn't know you 

1021
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,220
could say he says he likes to suck cock.
You know,

1022
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,350
she just made something of them.
You can't be saying that.

1023
00:47:49,351 --> 00:47:50,660
I can make that up.
Brian,

1024
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,260
when Steve was neck,
my dog.

1025
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,360
Shit.
Dog.

1026
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,420
You guys tight?
Yeah,

1027
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:56,690
I didn't know bu my gosh,

1028
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:01,930
they added a multitouch to the that new 
google phone.

1029
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,550
Yeah,
just like an iphone does the same thing.

1030
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,540
It's about time now.
Nobody owns the right to do that.

1031
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,440
Nobody owns it.

1032
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,820
Supposedly apple had the US patent 
night.

1033
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:13,130
So.
So what are they selling it to?

1034
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:15,020
All these people probably,

1035
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,990
but I don't know if that's all 
speculation.

1036
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:21,880
Actually.
It's probably Gizmodo there.

1037
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,660
You can't find that you mother was 
google.

1038
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:29,661
Is this Gizmo Gizmo Bitch fucking 
Internet.

1039
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,860
Shelly's,
well,

1040
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,690
we've got to find out which cars were,
uh,

1041
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,520
were recalled and whether or not Steve 
was nag actually said it was a software 

1042
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,460
issue.
That's scary.

1043
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:47,470
She's really pissed.
That's scary shit because that guy's a 

1044
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,160
super genius.
One of the guys who helped create apple,

1045
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,440
you know,
and uh,

1046
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:56,330
you know,
that's not something that Erica would 

1047
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:56,330
say lightly.
Okay.

1048
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:00,390
Toyota,
to borrow Steve Wozniaks Prius for a 

1049
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:00,390
week.
No,

1050
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:03,750
that's not it.
No,

1051
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,410
no.
That's software and duplicate either.

1052
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,340
That's it.
Yup.

1053
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,120
Toyota Prius has scary software program.
He could duplicate.

1054
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,810
Told the crowd chromosomes.
Social situation problem in the Prius.

1055
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,200
Oh,
it's not under a recall.

1056
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,710
This is software.
It's not a bad accelerator pedal.

1057
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,630
It's very scary.
Whoa.

1058
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:32,530
Toyota has had.
Toyota has this accelerator problem 

1059
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,161
we've all heard about.
I have many models of Prius that got 

1060
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:40,541
recalled,
but I have a new model of didn't get 

1061
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:42,821
recalled.
This model has an accelerator that goes 

1062
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:45,371
wild,
but only under certain conditions have 

1063
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:47,891
cruise control.
And I can repeat it over and over again 

1064
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:47,891
safely.
Whoa.

1065
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:54,790
That's fucking terrifying.
That's what's the greatest thing about 

1066
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:57,491
old cars.
Old Cars are fucking terrible to drive 

1067
00:49:57,491 --> 00:49:57,491
like my old 1970 Barracuda.
Yeah.

1068
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:02,650
But there's,
there's something about old cars where 

1069
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,531
there's no computer running.
Nothing was like a direct experience 

1070
00:50:05,531 --> 00:50:06,650
between you and the engine.
You know what I'm saying?

1071
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:09,620
Like those old,
the old sound of the engine,

1072
00:50:09,621 --> 00:50:11,420
everything about it connected to the 
car.

1073
00:50:11,421 --> 00:50:14,440
It was all connected.
There ain't no fucking computer is going

1074
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,040
to save you bitch.
It's just a car.

1075
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,440
You better not get crazy but better.
I think you can,

1076
00:50:18,441 --> 00:50:23,441
you know,
take that turn to too quick and you 

1077
00:50:23,441 --> 00:50:25,871
know,
the wheels will lock up on the outside 

1078
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:25,871
so you'll be all right.
No you're fuck man.

1079
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:28,160
That's not gonna save you one of the 
many reasons

1080
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,330
not to buy a prius.
You know,

1081
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:31,120
it's really interesting.
Um,

1082
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,280
I think it was a prius that they did.
They did this because a priest is a 

1083
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:36,280
hybrid,
right?

1084
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:36,440
Yes.
Yeah.

1085
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,720
There was a prius.
Then they took a prius.

1086
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,000
This is what they did.
This on top gear.

1087
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:44,690
That fucking awesome car show on the BBC
if you haven't seen it.

1088
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,860
So you can get it on BBC on like do you 
get direct TV?

1089
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:52,870
They have like BBC America and it's a,
it's an awesome car show and they did 

1090
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:56,900
this test with a.
took a prius and they ran around a track

1091
00:50:56,901 --> 00:51:01,901
as fast as it could go as fast as they 
could get it to go around the track and 

1092
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:05,921
they followed it with a bmw m three,
which has a big Vat and they found out 

1093
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:10,571
that all the BMW,
all BMW had to do was to stay at the 

1094
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:10,640
same pace as the Prius.

1095
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,350
Just keep up with it.
That's all it had to do.

1096
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,630
Well when they measure the miles per 
gallon,

1097
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:17,240
the BMW got more miles per gallon in the
Prius.

1098
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,440
It's like when you drive it fast,
it looks like it's a piece of shit.

1099
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,240
It's like yeah,
that's your reasoning.

1100
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,110
There's no reason to.
And the long run,

1101
00:51:25,111 --> 00:51:30,111
the price also costs so much more money 
that you'll be spinning on the car that 

1102
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:33,410
it's not even worth the money you save 
on their gross look into.

1103
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,560
And it was.
I think they said it was like the 

1104
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,631
difference between like the Prius was 
only getting like 14 miles to the 

1105
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:41,210
gallon.
The BMW got like 17 or 18.

1106
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:41,930
Yeah.
By the way,

1107
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:46,931
I posted a number of Steve Wiszniak 
video has posted at my twitter,

1108
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:49,670
which is backslash red band.
I'm going to retweet,

1109
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,340
retweet,
retweet,

1110
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:57,110
retweet,
fucking know how we do and what's 

1111
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:58,650
awesome.
We're talking about the IPAD now,

1112
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:03,680
so a manufacturer a that's going to fix 
I pads.

1113
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:08,430
He has a company that fixes i-phones 
fixes like a third party warranty guy.

1114
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,050
Could you tweet that?
Yeah,

1115
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,820
I just thought,
well you just gotta you just gotTa do it

1116
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:13,260
now.

1117
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:14,730
Oh,
that's it.

1118
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:21,470
Just because you're using that.
I'll go to my twitter page to how you're

1119
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,070
supposed to do it.

1120
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,480
That's gross.
And your twitter page if you don't use 

1121
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:30,480
tweet deck,
man,

1122
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,030
you live in.
So 2000.

1123
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,040
I don't tweet that much.
Oh yeah.

1124
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:36,820
Whatever lies.
I forgot what I was saying.

1125
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,170
Yeah,
because you're stoned.

1126
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,540
Oh,
so this ipad manufacturer that is going 

1127
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:44,540
to fix it pads,
he fixes iphones.

1128
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,100
Just got a shipment.
Every placement bezels for the IPAD.

1129
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,280
So if he ever has to replace that and it
has a spot for a camera in it and that 

1130
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,200
the software has caused to a camera and 
all those other things.

1131
00:52:55,201 --> 00:53:00,201
So the IPAD,
they might not even be done with the 

1132
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:00,201
Ipad,
like it's going to come in with a camera

1133
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:01,980
and all these other things.
Probably that's what it looks like.

1134
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:07,390
So this is just the beginning.
So the first one is just this plane.

1135
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,430
The first one was not finished as well.
A lot of people are thinking like it was

1136
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:12,940
like a prototype because that's why it's
two months away and stuff.

1137
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,570
They were still really.
This is all,

1138
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,600
this sounds like some fucking 
conspiracies type marketing shit to 

1139
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,510
probably think probably.
Why would you do that though?

1140
00:53:22,511 --> 00:53:25,060
Why would you release a crappy one or 
you get a crappy ones?

1141
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:27,240
You were going to be talking about it 
every time there's a new rumor,

1142
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,810
you know,
like,

1143
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:32,811
oh now it has a.
well maybe they'll hold off for a few 

1144
00:53:32,811 --> 00:53:33,360
months and then come up with a version 
two.

1145
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,120
Maybe they'll do that.
But if there are any doing anything like

1146
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:41,121
the iphone,
it's probably once a year down man.

1147
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:46,370
They got people that bitches.
Apple has more people that are bitches 

1148
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,361
and than any other company in the world.
Did you see the spice shot of the next 

1149
00:53:49,361 --> 00:53:49,361
iphone?

1150
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:55,890
Which is funny because I was just 
thinking how I'm a little bit of an 

1151
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:55,890
apple bitch.
I'm going to be honest with you.

1152
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:00,390
They got me a little while.
I get all fucking hyped up when I fly 

1153
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,351
out to have a new announcement.
I get fired up and I don't remember the 

1154
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:05,650
last time I ever got fired up for 
anything that Microsoft makes a.

1155
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:08,320
it's funny because these photos that get
released like this photo,

1156
00:54:08,321 --> 00:54:13,321
the next iphone is so awful.
It could be just like a box on the 

1157
00:54:13,321 --> 00:54:14,650
ground and it's like people are freaking
out about this.

1158
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,360
You know what's really funny?
People?

1159
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,740
What does that.
That is what people are hilarious about.

1160
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:22,620
That looks like an iphone man.
People retarded.

1161
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,660
I know who gives a shit whether you use 
windows or Mac,

1162
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
everybody gets nutty.
That's what's really crazy about all 

1163
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,030
this shit is that people pick teams,
you know,

1164
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:35,610
they're on team windows or Mac.

1165
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:38,010
Like what the fuck do you care?
Like really?

1166
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:38,970
You want to.
Why do,

1167
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,030
why does everybody want to using the 
same shit?

1168
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:42,910
It's,
if you don't prefer it,

1169
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:47,911
that's fine.
I don't give a fuck and taken pictures 

1170
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:47,911
and had a picture online,
you know,

1171
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:49,900
have me on a laptop and you see the 
little apple thing.

1172
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,570
Oh Joe,
what the fuck do you know you use Mac so

1173
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:53,800
gay.
Like what?

1174
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,540
You're upset at the choice of computer.
I make weird what?

1175
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:00,490
I'm on the wrong computer team.
Really?

1176
00:55:00,491 --> 00:55:03,010
We have computer teams.
We team up for everything.

1177
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:05,980
We are fucking dumb.
God Damn.

1178
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:09,040
People are dumb.
We argue over fucking operating systems.

1179
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:12,100
People get mad if you choose the wrong 
brand of car.

1180
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:17,220
Like there's dudes would get mad at 
their buddies for buying Chevy's the 

1181
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:17,230
fuck bro.
Ford for life,

1182
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,910
for life bro.
We were Ford for live dumb assholes.

1183
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:26,200
They have like the picture of the Calvin
and hobbes peeing on the Chevy logo.

1184
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,850
You know,
and it's weird thing.

1185
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,200
There's just certain things that are 
like,

1186
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,120
like coke and Pepsi,
Pepsi,

1187
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:32,940
what the fuck?
What the fuck is wrong with?

1188
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,770
Is there a definitive difference between
the two of them?

1189
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:40,830
Who Fountain when you go to like a sub 
shop and he ran the fountain.

1190
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,380
That could be anything.
Diet coke,

1191
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,960
diet coke.
It's like there's a certain amount of 

1192
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,941
sweetener,
a certain amount of color and just shut 

1193
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:53,941
the fuck up and drank it.
That's pig slop,

1194
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:55,330
man.
That's some shit.

1195
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:57,130
You only drink because you're starving 
or you're drunk.

1196
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,150
Motherfuckers.
People are so God damn dumb.

1197
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,610
US included sometimes,
but not as much.

1198
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,800
Not as much as last year.
Moving forward for the future.

1199
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,620
Always trying to evolve.
Hey,

1200
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:20,770
how you see that video of this?
Somebody filmed at the space shuttle 

1201
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:20,770
blowing up.
Yeah.

1202
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:21,560
It's pretty trippy.
Those two old George,

1203
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,850
weird,
dire trouble

1204
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,400
growing up in the.
When it exploded

1205
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:32,010
in this guy and started spinning around 
separate pieces.

1206
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,660
That's not trouble.

1207
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,620
Brian.
The Usual Jimminy cricket.

1208
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,170
I know I'm never going to get in 
trouble.

1209
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:49,090
You've got to go to school.
Come here and that trouble in this guy.

1210
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,790
What a horrible,
tragic handkerchief

1211
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,200
feed the woman.
Not to belittle the challenger,

1212
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:56,940
exploding.
I remember I was watching that.

1213
00:56:56,941 --> 00:56:59,160
I was at this girl's house.
I was like,

1214
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,920
it was 1986,
so I was.

1215
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:05,670
It wasn't any sex like 19 years old.
Completely lost it.

1216
00:57:05,671 --> 00:57:08,190
No idea what I was doing my life.
I had a hard time getting laid.

1217
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:14,060
Very difficult.
So this ex girlfriend who lived like an 

1218
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,630
hour and a half away and I was talking 
on the phone and we're talking dirty and

1219
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:19,320
she wanted me to drive up to visit her 
and it was such a fucking long drive and

1220
00:57:19,321 --> 00:57:24,321
it was the winter.
It was snowing out and I'm an idiot and 

1221
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:24,321
I went out there and

1222
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,790
completely forgot what I was talking 
about.

1223
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,770
How high am I work out and you're 
watching challenger,

1224
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,390
so what?
So we're sitting there and we're sitting

1225
00:57:32,391 --> 00:57:36,680
there in front of the television in the 
morning and she goes to the bathroom and

1226
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:39,860
I turned on the TV and right when I 
turned the TV it fucking exploded.

1227
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,750
It was that second.
Wow.

1228
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:44,150
Right when I turned on the TV,
they were showing it and I don't know if

1229
00:57:44,151 --> 00:57:45,980
it was a replay,
I don't think it was.

1230
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:51,210
It's hard to remember,
but I remember like very clearly at the 

1231
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,790
moment I turned on the TV,
the image of the thing exploding,

1232
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:57,820
what's happening right there,
and you were seeing spiral and you're 

1233
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:57,820
like,
what the fuck is that?

1234
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,520
It was like a weird,
like,

1235
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:00,560
what is that?
What's going on over there?

1236
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:06,890
And then people started talking about it
and then it took a while before they 

1237
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:07,620
just flat out admitted,
okay,

1238
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,510
everybody's dead.
Like that shit just blew up.

1239
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,260
Like I think for awhile they were like 
wondering whether or not the people that

1240
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,110
survived,
if the capsule it made it to the ground,

1241
00:58:16,111 --> 00:58:17,160
you know,
they're looking for parents,

1242
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:22,161
shoots and shit.
It was all sorts of different kinds of 

1243
00:58:22,161 --> 00:58:22,161
reports.
But I remember thinking,

1244
00:58:22,161 --> 00:58:25,341
Holy Shit,
those people just got shot through the 

1245
00:58:25,341 --> 00:58:28,761
fucking air and exploded in the sky.
What a crazy way to go.

1246
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,860
What a crazy thing to do.

1247
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:32,650
No,
it's so weird.

1248
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:37,651
When I saw it,
I saw it with a bunch of people and we 

1249
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:40,531
all had to watch tv because we were in 
middle school and it happened and to 

1250
00:58:40,531 --> 00:58:41,380
start crying and I just remember like,
oh,

1251
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:46,381
what's going on?
And the teachers were all freaking 

1252
00:58:46,381 --> 00:58:46,381
because you couldn't like just text your
mom like,

1253
00:58:46,381 --> 00:58:46,900
hey mom,
do you know what happened?

1254
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,960
So you have to get like these birds and 
tight messages to a man who swift to 

1255
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:58,931
foot knows the way home quickly run some
amazing how back in the day you just had

1256
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:05,491
no communication with friends and family
and you call people and if you've got a 

1257
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:07,360
hold of them,
you got a hold of them.

1258
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:07,720
Yeah.

1259
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:12,860
Have you didn't mean it must've been so 
easy to get away with everything back 

1260
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:12,860
then.

1261
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:12,860
Oh,
everything.

1262
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:15,210
I was thinking about having a second 
where you were.

1263
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:20,270
When I was a teenager,
I would have sex in public places 

1264
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:20,270
because I went.
I wasn't allowed to have sex at home,

1265
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:23,090
so I'd go to like behind little Caesar's
and fuck behind beside the dumpster.

1266
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,580
And one time this guy came out and was 
like shocked.

1267
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:26,780
Like he worked at these places,
he goes,

1268
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:28,400
Oh,
I'm sorry you want some pizza?

1269
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:33,401
Because he thought we were homeless,
but I'm thinking nowadays you on the 

1270
00:59:33,401 --> 00:59:35,930
ground laying on her and it was just 
like God,

1271
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:39,770
but now ground on the dirt dude.
We used to do it in movie theaters,

1272
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,590
theaters all the time.
Or I could just get her to like climb on

1273
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:44,110
top and he goes to fern.
Golly,

1274
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,190
you know,
because no one else was there during the

1275
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:51,190
day watching fern gully.
But you're in the back half the fern 

1276
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:51,190
gully having sex.
But nowadays,

1277
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,930
can you imagine I can't do that because 
it will be filmed and on youtube done on

1278
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,960
youporn because like everyone just 
filming and I wonder if kids are having 

1279
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,470
a hard time finding places to have sex 
without cameras are being back.

1280
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,730
Yeah,
it's not,

1281
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:08,820
it's not like nasty.
They know what's really fucked up is 

1282
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:08,970
this whole sexting thing with young 
kids.

1283
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,180
And what's happening if you don't know,
is that these young kids are sending,

1284
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,430
you know,
you give a 13 year old cell phone.

1285
01:00:14,431 --> 01:00:17,700
They're going to take pictures of their 
dicks to girls.

1286
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,860
Girls are going to take pictures of the 
posters.

1287
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,500
The boys,
it's musical girl.

1288
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,810
There's always going to be one freak 
bitch in the class.

1289
01:00:24,811 --> 01:00:26,280
It's willing to take it to the next 
level.

1290
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:31,380
All right.
There's always one girl whose dad was 

1291
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,060
not around and she needs male attention 
and she needs it extremely bad and she's

1292
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:38,061
willing to fucking logout.
We are so lucky because my shit would 

1293
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:41,621
have been everywhere.
There'd be live video of me just having 

1294
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:43,290
sex on web cams if this gets pretty 
crazy,

1295
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,210
pretty crazy.
You know?

1296
01:00:45,211 --> 01:00:48,930
It's just really wrong that kids,
when you're that young,

1297
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:51,000
you make all kinds of fucking mistakes.

1298
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,950
People,
they do all kinds of stupid shit.

1299
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:55,500
Your dumb.
The fact that kids today,

1300
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:58,720
like anything you say and do.
Back then it was like,

1301
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,530
that shit is like a record forever.
You know,

1302
01:01:01,531 --> 01:01:03,130
any,
any blog you write,

1303
01:01:03,131 --> 01:01:08,131
any space picks you post up like that 
Shit's a record of you for the rest of 

1304
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,240
your life.
You know,

1305
01:01:09,241 --> 01:01:13,690
and for some kids,
fuck up and pictures of them suck.

1306
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,430
A deck.
Then some dude who ordinarily would like

1307
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:20,130
really loved this chick,
but can't get over the fact that there's

1308
01:01:20,131 --> 01:01:25,131
this picture that every one of his 
friends has of her sucking her ex 

1309
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:25,131
boyfriends,
cock that's online.

1310
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:30,340
I think he just freaks out.
He can't fucking deal with it and that 

1311
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:33,050
ruins the relationship because this dude
can't deal with the fact there's a 

1312
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:33,990
picture online that anybody could say 
where I've his wife,

1313
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:39,540
the mother of his children,
supposedly someday and some other guys 

1314
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,350
deck,
especially if it's a black guy,

1315
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,000
right?

1316
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:48,060
We go back to the Julia Roberts hurt,
hurt and that black eyes,

1317
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,290
let's be honest,
you know,

1318
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,980
for the most part,
except for obviously Brock Lesnar,

1319
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:58,830
he says that brock Lesnar was like a 
white guy with black guys.

1320
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,010
Check this shit out.
This is a great email I got today from.

1321
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,380
Listen man,
we're in a very tricky subject.

1322
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,210
Just interrupt me when I'm talking about
genetics,

1323
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,510
black people,
until I clarify that I'm not a racist.

1324
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:14,690
How dare you.
It's very important because going to go 

1325
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,871
into another medical thing,
it's a funny thing that you would think 

1326
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:17,871
that people would think that,
uh,

1327
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:18,990
like saying that a black guy having a 
bigger deck.

1328
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,930
I'm black,
I've been better sexually and you know,

1329
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,010
more,
more troublesome to white dudes.

1330
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,780
You why?
How would that be racist?

1331
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:26,610
Wouldn't that be like positive for black
eyes?

1332
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,020
Could you imagine what people are saying
that about you racist?

1333
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:36,070
He's digging,
but there's a lot of people that if you 

1334
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:36,070
say that,
if you put it that way,

1335
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:40,641
like there,
there's people that think that black 

1336
01:02:40,641 --> 01:02:40,641
eyes

1337
01:02:40,641 --> 01:02:40,641
oversexed black lives

1338
01:02:40,641 --> 01:02:41,510
more well endowed.

1339
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,770
Hold on.

1340
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:49,720
Is that your page or making that noise?

1341
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,680
What the fuck?
What the fuck got suckered

1342
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:06,160
anyway,
ladies and gentlemen,

1343
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:08,770
what we're talking about guys.
Dicks.

1344
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,700
If you're not scared,
you're not paying attention.

1345
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,070
Go Online.
There's some incredible fucking porn out

1346
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:16,210
there where you can't believe that's 
really.

1347
01:03:16,211 --> 01:03:18,290
That guy's dead.
How many black guy?

1348
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:23,370
Because it's fake though.
Like there's a lot of them is fake and 

1349
01:03:23,831 --> 01:03:25,930
there's a lot of them that are real 
giant dicks.

1350
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:27,970
There's a lot of them do.
There's some dudes like,

1351
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:33,210
what's that guy's name?
Lexington steals dicks like 14 inches 

1352
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,150
long and it's like like an arm.
It's huge.

1353
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,060
It's gigantic.
That's real snow.

1354
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:39,520
White guys like that online,
you know,

1355
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,620
because even like John Holmes,
you want to go old school.

1356
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:46,621
John Holmes at a big duck,
but he was club you with it it and 

1357
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:46,621
stabbing me with it.
It was so big.

1358
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:48,900
It never totally got hard.
It was like an elephant's trunk.

1359
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:50,980
Never got hard.

1360
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:56,010
It was disappointing.
He had like this super hot checks and 

1361
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,591
they were trying to suck his dick,
but he was on heroin doubt with this 

1362
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:01,020
giant rubber monster.
Dick has trying to snake it into their 

1363
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:01,020
mouths.
You know?

1364
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,590
It was never like a,
like a black guy's giant Dick Black.

1365
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,020
I was trying to dig.
That thing's going to do south.

1366
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:11,021
Done some shit's going down.
Have you been to the playboy mansion 

1367
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:11,021
before?
Yeah,

1368
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:12,430
I was there a couple times for the 
strikeforce fights.

1369
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,530
I went there for once.
I had to do a,

1370
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,760
a fear factor broadcast.
It was early in the morning and for a 

1371
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,951
marijuana project where you going to 
told me that like everything's like so 

1372
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:23,020
antique,
like the old way old.

1373
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,910
Yeah.
There's something cool about it.

1374
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,870
I mean there's something ridiculous 
about that.

1375
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,780
They have an upgraded it and change it 
for the.

1376
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,230
But there's something kind of cool but 
a.

1377
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,890
because it really stopped thinking 
about.

1378
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,490
I mean this is just a party house,
right?

1379
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:37,090
Like isn't it kind of dope that this is 
the same phone from 1970?

1380
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,130
I mean it's a fucking,
it's like a rotary phone and shit man.

1381
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,060
You know?
Or if it's a push button phone,

1382
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,610
I can't remember.
It's a rotary or push buttons,

1383
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,420
but if it's pushed by some old wack ass 
look and Shit,

1384
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,300
you know.
But that's kind of cool because it makes

1385
01:04:49,301 --> 01:04:51,040
you part of is like,
yeah,

1386
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:51,730
that's,
you know,

1387
01:04:51,731 --> 01:04:53,710
they should upgraded,
that's not even cool anymore.

1388
01:04:53,711 --> 01:04:58,711
That's shit too tired.
But there's so much history to it that 

1389
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:00,550
it's almost like a living museum to like
Hollywood,

1390
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:05,910
you know?
I mean think about how many people 

1391
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,910
partied in that place.
You know,

1392
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:07,060
that's like where James Caan was always 
hanging out.

1393
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:08,820
Holly shore,
pauly shore,

1394
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:11,980
and fucking first is always hanging out 
there.

1395
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:14,890
Have you seen the biodome thing that's 
been abandoned by scientists?

1396
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:18,490
Remember that thing that like the movie 
the biodome is all about the indoor

1397
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:20,630
don't those with pauly shore,
Steven.

1398
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:22,300
That's a real.
Don't know.

1399
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:23,860
That's a real biodapt really?
Yeah,

1400
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:26,270
and now it's like abandoned and like 
they showed it and has been.

1401
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:31,360
This is where they were doing 
experiments with seeing people could 

1402
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:31,360
live together in this one.
Right.

1403
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,770
And they abandoned it.
What happened in those experiments?

1404
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:33,960
Right.
I don't know.

1405
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,440
I thought that was a funny mood at the 
time.

1406
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,380
I thought it was silly.
It was funny.

1407
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,230
Andrew dice clay is all the movie 
forward.

1408
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,440
Farrell,
where he's jumping off the building.

1409
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:49,441
He was like my hair,
my hair back when that came out last 

1410
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:49,441
year.

1411
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:49,960
Dice Clay.
And not that I'm not anymore,

1412
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:51,220
but I am.
I am still.

1413
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,560
I think he's hilarious.
I've got to see him.

1414
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,120
I've got to see dyfs,
the comedy store.

1415
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:59,320
So many nights go up and who was just 
crushing people in the audience.

1416
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,210
He's a nut.
He's a fun dude.

1417
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:04,150
You know,
I liked this whole thing.

1418
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,450
I like his whole,
his whole attitude,

1419
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:09,760
his demeanor.
I think he's Hilarious,

1420
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:12,160
but when I was a kid,
he was gigantic.

1421
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:17,340
There was no comedian.
The kids were more excited about when I 

1422
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,820
was a kid then dice clay when dice 
client blew up and when he started doing

1423
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:22,240
like Madison Square Garden and Shit,
that's all anybody talked about.

1424
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:24,550
Dude.
There was kids all day in school.

1425
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:27,430
Everybody below like,
you know what's in the bowl bitch,

1426
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,530
you know,
people would sit everywhere.

1427
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,760
Yeah.
Something.

1428
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,510
Everybody was doing vice clay lines.
You do a good dice.

1429
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:36,790
Clay.
I've been around him so many years,

1430
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,170
you know,
at the comedy store.

1431
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:41,770
That was one of the craziest things 
about being a kid and being a fan of his

1432
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:43,090
and then being,
you know,

1433
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,030
then starting to be an amateur comedian 
and then,

1434
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:46,680
you know,
doing,

1435
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:52,050
getting paid gigs after a couple of 
years and then moving to California 

1436
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,920
years and years later because that I 
would go on and I would have to 

1437
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,510
introduce dice,
you know,

1438
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:59,050
like the comedy store,
the way it used to work and still does.

1439
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:04,150
Um,
but the way it works is each comic 

1440
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,190
brings up the next comment.
So like I got brought on stage by Martin

1441
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:11,190
Lawrence.
I was one of the first time somebody 

1442
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:11,620
famous ever did it and you know,
he brought me on stage and I was like,

1443
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:16,650
Holy Shit.
Like Martin Lawrence just said my name 

1444
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:16,650
and brought me.
I was like,

1445
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:17,680
to me that was like a crazy deal.

1446
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:18,450
Like,
you know,

1447
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:23,520
see that guy on TV and movies and all of
a sudden I'm shaking his hand and now 

1448
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,160
I've got to go on stage after him and 
nobody knows who the fuck I am.

1449
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:29,580
But dice clay was the coolest.
That was the craziest one ever that was 

1450
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:29,580
like,
you know,

1451
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,930
getting the WHO's next?
Who?

1452
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:36,931
Joe Rogan,
who the fuck is Joe Rogan and I don't 

1453
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:37,120
remember how it said it,
but what he brought me on this date,

1454
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:38,020
I was like,
Holy Shit.

1455
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,750
Dice fucking clegg has brought me on 
stage.

1456
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:43,810
Like that was a.
to me that was a fun moment.

1457
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:45,630
That was a crazy moment comedy.
You know,

1458
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:51,120
when I was a kid,
that guy was a the most hyped up comic 

1459
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,630
ever.
Mark Gaydon?

1460
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,760
Yes you did.
You did open up for me in.

1461
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:59,260
I'm an England mark.
Hayden is going to freak out.

1462
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:03,550
He keeps insisting that this mark Gaydon
guy is not him,

1463
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:08,551
but whoever this guy is,
I think he's representing Mark Hayden 

1464
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:11,971
very well,
so I'm going to keep pretending that he 

1465
01:08:11,971 --> 01:08:11,980
is him.
Who is Joe Rogan?

1466
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,320
You're doing standup and CEO before the 
versus.

1467
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,580
Oh,
who is Joe Rogan?

1468
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:22,140
Hmm.
Is that like how these kids are talking 

1469
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:22,140
these days?
Who is Joe Rogan is a new way of talking

1470
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,140
to people.
That doesn't make any sense.

1471
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,030
That sounds cool.
That does kind of sound cool.

1472
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:28,100
You know,
what is your name dude?

1473
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:33,100
Carpet version.
Carpet version.

1474
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,890
Who is copper version?
You know,

1475
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,700
if that's what you say when you see 
people instead of like,

1476
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:37,300
Hey,
what's up dude?

1477
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:41,130
Say who is Joe Rogan?
I'm I doing stand up in Colorado.

1478
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,010
Yeah,
I'll be doing it somewhere.

1479
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:45,400
I don't know how many books,
but I will definitely be there the night

1480
01:08:45,401 --> 01:08:47,400
before.
Whatever the uh,

1481
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:51,100
I think the UFC fights or on a Sunday 
night I think.

1482
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,600
I'm not sure,
but whatever,

1483
01:08:52,601 --> 01:08:54,390
whatever night there on the night before
that,

1484
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:58,090
whether it's a Saturday or Friday,
I'll be doing standup and I'll put it on

1485
01:08:58,091 --> 01:08:59,470
twitter and I'll let you bitches now.

1486
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:07,200
Have you heard of the cat that was 
predicted over 50 deaths in a nursing 

1487
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:07,200
home?
You know what that's like?

1488
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,400
That's like predicting alcoholics are 
going to drink.

1489
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:12,550
That's ridiculous.
That's a terrible fucking prediction.

1490
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,790
Tell that fucking faggot cat to go 
predict.

1491
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,250
I know it is only curls up around people
when they get to die.

1492
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:18,790
Yeah,
right.

1493
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:20,950
When they're about to die,
they're dying the job,

1494
01:09:20,951 --> 01:09:25,951
but like flies thousand years old.
They're a bunch of old people living 

1495
01:09:25,951 --> 01:09:26,830
with other old people that are dying.
It's not a fun environment.

1496
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:31,831
It just goes back to that whole weird 
thing about how animals might have 

1497
01:09:31,831 --> 01:09:33,730
sensors that we don't even know about 
them and then when that video of the dog

1498
01:09:33,731 --> 01:09:38,731
in here,
it might be or it might be these people 

1499
01:09:38,731 --> 01:09:40,671
are hanging on by a thread so thin that 
tat hops in that last bucket that night.

1500
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,720
Yeah,
that's possible too,

1501
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,430
man.
You gotTa admit it's possible.

1502
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:49,630
Can you discuss vaporizers?
I would recommend vaporizers.

1503
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:55,500
The volcano is a very good one.
It's sometimes kind of a pain in the 

1504
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:55,870
ass.
I mean at the end of the day,

1505
01:09:55,871 --> 01:09:59,290
you don't want to be that guy that's 
sucking out of a plastic bag.

1506
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,400
It just seems like a junkie move.
I'm not a fan.

1507
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:03,250
Right.
It seems like junky behavior.

1508
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,890
Do we suck it out of a plastic bag?
Something seems wrong,

1509
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,780
but there's another vaporizer that I 
enjoy.

1510
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,050
It's like a glass pipe,
like a,

1511
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:15,080
like a glass lip,
like sort of like a bond with a tube 

1512
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:15,670
attached to it and you stick it on this 
thing and yeah.

1513
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:16,960
That's cool.
That's cool one.

1514
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,730
You know what I like about that one?
You don't need,

1515
01:10:18,731 --> 01:10:21,100
you don't need like five friends around 
you to get high.

1516
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:22,720
You know,
like when that bag fills up,

1517
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:24,110
you don't know when to stop.
Right.

1518
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,860
You keep sucking it in and then you're 
too high and then you're like,

1519
01:10:26,861 --> 01:10:29,500
I can't even think that's not good.
This is the other vaporizer.

1520
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:31,840
You can take one hit and Bam and you 
know what's up?

1521
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:34,690
I liked that one better,
but if you got a party,

1522
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:37,700
you've got a bunch of people hanging 
around and you're all medical patients.

1523
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:39,130
Many bongs.
No.

1524
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,490
Have you got a bunch of people around 
them?

1525
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,520
The volcanoes to shit,
then it's perfect because for all being 

1526
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,350
junkies together,
man,

1527
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,500
I suck out of this plastic bag.
It's weird.

1528
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:51,490
I'll keep it together.
Yeah.

1529
01:10:51,491 --> 01:10:53,210
There's some weird about sucking out of 
a plastic bag.

1530
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:53,750
Me,
I'm just like,

1531
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:54,600
you know,
like a joint.

1532
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:55,480
Just give me a joint.
That's cool.

1533
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,640
I'm a fan of the joint too,
you know.

1534
01:10:57,641 --> 01:10:59,830
Well I joined because,
first of all,

1535
01:10:59,831 --> 01:11:01,390
because you don't have to keep lighting 
it.

1536
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:03,700
And I hated the taste of lighter fluid.
No,

1537
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:08,790
that shit's nasty.
Like if you have a glass pipe and you 

1538
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:08,790
keep tasting that lighter fluid.
Yeah.

1539
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:10,390
That shit ain't good for you.
Especially when it's like a Zippo.

1540
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,500
You're like,
Oh really?

1541
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,030
You got that shit.
Ain't good for you man.

1542
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,070
I don't like it.
I liked

1543
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,930
joints.
I'm converted joints,

1544
01:11:15,931 --> 01:11:18,000
man.
I liked that shit with a match,

1545
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:23,180
you know,
if I can or if I'm doing it with a 

1546
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,371
lighter,
I'd get it real quick and I'll let it 

1547
01:11:25,371 --> 01:11:25,371
sit for a minute.
And uh,

1548
01:11:25,371 --> 01:11:26,010
I think there's a residue man that gets 
on,

1549
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,920
on the weed with those lighters and I 
think that Shit's bad for you.

1550
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:32,190
It's probably worse for you than smoking
for some people.

1551
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:34,410
Like for your lungs.
It's going to be very unhealthy man.

1552
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:36,930
It's like a toxic fume you're inhaling,
you know,

1553
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:38,730
that ain't good.
You know,

1554
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:40,120
we don't.
There's no studies done.

1555
01:11:40,121 --> 01:11:42,570
And you know how many times you can 
fucking suck off,

1556
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:46,230
lighter fluid and breathed into your 
lungs and not do permanent damage,

1557
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:51,290
you know,
joint bitches matches and joint stop 

1558
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:55,101
fucking around or go with vaporizer if 
you don't know what the vaporizer is.

1559
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,820
The beautiful thing is,
is there's no fire,

1560
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,690
there's no smoke.

1561
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:59,030
It's like a mixed.
And what it is,

1562
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:03,180
is you pack the product,
the memorable and put into,

1563
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:08,181
into this little filtered area.
And then you connect that to this 

1564
01:12:08,181 --> 01:12:11,091
machine and then it heats up and then 
you inhale and it's literally like 

1565
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:13,380
missed.
And that missed is just the pure thc.

1566
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,290
It's a very heady experience.
It's very,

1567
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:21,291
um,
like you'll come up with some of your 

1568
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:21,291
craziest thoughts on vaporized.
We'd,

1569
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,960
except the only thing crazier is eating 
when you eat it.

1570
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:27,330
That's the craziest.
I don't like that anymore.

1571
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,130
Eating.
It gets scary.

1572
01:12:29,131 --> 01:12:31,030
We've talked about that overheard of 
nutmeg.

1573
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,360
Man.
Your Mama.

1574
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,580
Oh one.
Oh eight,

1575
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:36,030
nine.
Three.

1576
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

1577
01:12:37,531 --> 01:12:42,531
I heard you can get high off nutmeg 
somehow or another one of the guys are 

1578
01:12:42,531 --> 01:12:43,080
message board hr.
I think he did it.

1579
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:45,930
He tried it and documented it.
He said it was really tripping.

1580
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,670
It lasted a long time and it's kind of 
gross.

1581
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,800
I think anything that's really good 
people would be doing it left and right.

1582
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,420
And I think there's plenty of shit to 
get high on.

1583
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,550
You know,
we don't.

1584
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,180
But the one thing that I think is 
interesting,

1585
01:12:57,181 --> 01:13:02,181
they came up with a new marijuana.
It's a synthetic marijuana and it gives 

1586
01:13:02,181 --> 01:13:02,181
you like the same effects as regular 
marijuana,

1587
01:13:02,181 --> 01:13:04,180
but you don't test positive.
Yeah.

1588
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,320
And they're trying.
They're scrambling right now to make it 

1589
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:09,540
illegal and they call it two.
It's called k named after that mountain.

1590
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:11,430
And it's a synthetic version of 
marijuana.

1591
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,440
So if you have,
if you're a cop,

1592
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,440
if you have a government job and you 
have to piss tests all the time,

1593
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:17,050
you could smoke.

1594
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,510
Does Shit.
I used to in Ohio had the piss tests all

1595
01:13:19,511 --> 01:13:24,511
the time.
I need to go to the store and buy the 

1596
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:25,120
shit.
And it was scary when we be keeping pots

1597
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,520
for cops from smoking weed,
if anybody should be smoking weed,

1598
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:31,270
it's cops.
If anybody what?

1599
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,470
Cops should be smuggling weed.
Cops should be smoking weed.

1600
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,800
Fuck yeah.
The people that I'm down,

1601
01:13:35,801 --> 01:13:39,100
everybody calm the fuck down.
These are like intense people on.

1602
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,430
We'd like to be a cop.
You kind of have to get like a bully,

1603
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,090
like stuff.
I know a lot of guys so became

1604
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:51,090
cops and a lot of them became cops 
because it's good money and they're 

1605
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:52,630
tough guys.
They do martial arts and they figure,

1606
01:13:52,631 --> 01:13:55,300
you know what?
I can handle most situations.

1607
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:56,980
I'm pretty friendly.
I can handle this.

1608
01:13:56,981 --> 01:13:58,690
This is good money.
It's a good career.

1609
01:13:58,691 --> 01:14:00,670
I could set myself up,
have a nice pension.

1610
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,880
You got to look at it.
Realistically people look at it as it's 

1611
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,030
an economic choice for a lot of people.
Know I have a lot of buddies that became

1612
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:08,530
cops.
It's an economic choice.

1613
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,240
They just.
There's a lot of people did a great job,

1614
01:14:10,241 --> 01:14:15,241
man.
If you can get into Boston police 

1615
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:15,241
department

1616
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:15,241
is.
That's good.

1617
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:15,241
Fucking money.
You can make a nice living.

1618
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:15,850
You know,
you can get some,

1619
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,340
some detail work on the side,
you know,

1620
01:14:18,341 --> 01:14:20,320
and weekends and shit like that.
You pick up big money,

1621
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:23,800
no guardian places and shit like that,
and it's a good job,

1622
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:26,200
man.
It's not all Douche bags,

1623
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:32,230
but there's a lot of douchebags that 
work for better cops that if they were 

1624
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,130
stone would be horrible,
man.

1625
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,270
Maybe they'd be more sensitive.
We're not for everyone,

1626
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:36,600
that's for sure.
It's not.

1627
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,980
They don't have to do it,
but I think if they wanted to,

1628
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:45,040
they wanted a male out of the weekend,
like Serpico memory when Serpico got 

1629
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:45,170
high back in the seventies,
so have a go.

1630
01:14:45,171 --> 01:14:47,520
Didn't have.
They didn't have a drug test for Shoboko

1631
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:47,870
Albert,
you know,

1632
01:14:47,871 --> 01:14:49,530
and he was a cop who's just walk away 
with

1633
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:53,140
girl hanging out just like that movie 
superfly.

1634
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,140
That's remember.
Yeah.

1635
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,230
I've never seen super fine.
You never seen

1636
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:01,480
superfly ladies and gentlemen,
if you ever watched one blacksploitation

1637
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:04,130
movie from the seventies,
it should be super fly.

1638
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:08,140
It's one of the most God damn brilliant 
film to have ever been created.

1639
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:13,230
And when you're high it becomes a mother
fucking masterpiece because it's real.

1640
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:18,660
I mean,
this is a real move where they're 

1641
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:19,030
playing off real cool cats and one,
one time this guy says,

1642
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,940
you know everything he's thinking about 
getting out of the game.

1643
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,220
I got off the thing.
I ever

1644
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,270
bonded my hall,
my vines,

1645
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:30,140
a white woman like you,
my hall,

1646
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,010
my vines of white with my hall,
my car,

1647
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,830
my vines,
my clothes and white women like you.

1648
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:39,050
Wow.
It's genius,

1649
01:15:39,051 --> 01:15:40,550
Dude.
It's hilarious.

1650
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:43,910
It's such a bad movie.
It's so fucking good.

1651
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:49,240
It's so bad.
And so you could take a parody like 

1652
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,291
airplane and they'll be funny but 
they'll never be as funny as something 

1653
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,940
that's supposed to be good but isn't an.
It's funny on accident.

1654
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:59,000
There's something about those that it's 
like a different kind of funny.

1655
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,760
You know what I mean?
Like a holy shit funny.

1656
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,830
Like what the fuck were they thinking?
Funny,

1657
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,510
you know,
and superfly is one of the best of that.

1658
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:09,690
Like sort of like showgirls is 
showgirls,

1659
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,410
you see showgirls and it's like,
what the fuck are they doing?

1660
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:14,750
Like this movie crazy.
You know,

1661
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:15,960
it's one of them.

1662
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,040
What other movies are like that?

1663
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,300
I just can't believe some movies from 
the eighties.

1664
01:16:21,301 --> 01:16:24,870
I just can't believe people actually 
bought like the Howard,

1665
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:25,770
the duck maybe.
I'm like,

1666
01:16:25,771 --> 01:16:30,771
are you serious?
Your cartoon or I'm a comic book goes 

1667
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:30,771
Marvel Comics.
I know.

1668
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:33,900
I can't believe he was cool in the 
seventies and the eighties to when I was

1669
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:34,650
a kid.
I was a Howard.

1670
01:16:34,651 --> 01:16:36,480
The duck fan.
I would have by Howard.

1671
01:16:36,481 --> 01:16:37,600
The duck books.
Yeah,

1672
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,140
it's weird.
I was a marvel comics fan and Howard the

1673
01:16:40,141 --> 01:16:45,141
duck was a big part of marvel comics who
had drifted in and out all sorts of 

1674
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:48,261
comic books.
They did a lot of cool shit with Howard 

1675
01:16:48,261 --> 01:16:51,351
the duck.
I saw that movie theater and it was 

1676
01:16:51,351 --> 01:16:51,351
great because I was a kid and he was 
like.

1677
01:16:51,351 --> 01:16:54,900
I remember he pulled out condoms,
condoms to the Howard.

1678
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:57,660
The duck was cool when I was a kid 
because he was a duck,

1679
01:16:57,661 --> 01:16:59,610
but he was an adult.
He would.

1680
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,260
He was like a creepy duck,
you know,

1681
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,910
just trying to get laid.
I never read it.

1682
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:07,610
That was the Douglas Dope.
I was a huge vitamix.

1683
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,030
Spiderman mostly.
I love the x

1684
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:12,170
men.
I love Spiderman.

1685
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:17,380
The whole goes a big hug fan.
A big Conan the barbarian fan got 

1686
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:17,380
download,
loved in,

1687
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,310
you know,
I wish someone would have done.

1688
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:23,630
Someone will do a real cone and like 
almost in the style of gladiator,

1689
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:25,460
you know what I'm saying?
Like a real high end,

1690
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:28,700
not a cheese ball one.
I think they're doing another one,

1691
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:29,820
but it seems,
I don't know,

1692
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:34,880
it's got the rock in it.
I hate to be prejudiced coney island now

1693
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:41,860
and there's an image of him as cone and 
I mean he certainly looks the part and 

1694
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:42,290
who knows,
but maybe he could pull it off,

1695
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:47,770
but there's a certain amount of movies 
when you do a certain amount of kids 

1696
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:47,770
movies,
you know,

1697
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:51,701
after awhile I just felt like it's hard 
for me to watch you and something where 

1698
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:52,220
you're crazy,
you know,

1699
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:55,650
is making crazy money and still did 
good.

1700
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:58,100
Fake aggression.
Conan the barbarian.

1701
01:17:58,101 --> 01:17:59,680
If you ever read the book,
awesome.

1702
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:03,170
That was a big fan of the books.
This Guy Robert e Dot Howard,

1703
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:08,320
wrote him and he was just mad genius who
super depressed wrote all these books 

1704
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,220
and I think he was only like 36 when he 
blew his fucking brains out.

1705
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,070
Just couldn't take it anymore.
I just lived a terrible life,

1706
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,950
lived at his mother,
was super depressed apparently,

1707
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:19,340
and just wrote these incredible fantasy 
books about,

1708
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:24,341
you know,
far off lands and a fucking crew could 

1709
01:18:24,341 --> 01:18:25,490
not be beat,
would destroyed cut men down,

1710
01:18:25,491 --> 01:18:30,491
fight monsters,
shit and all fucking all these chicks 

1711
01:18:30,491 --> 01:18:30,830
and drinking wine.
And it just,

1712
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:36,040
he was just a,
like a human but yet hyper human 

1713
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,570
character that represented all this 
guy's frustrations.

1714
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,390
Fucking genius shit man.
You know,

1715
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:44,000
especially if you think about the fact 
that God was writing in the fifties,

1716
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,560
you know,
and then by the time they made it a 

1717
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:49,560
movie,
you know,

1718
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:49,560
Arnold Schwarzenegger was like,
Damn,

1719
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:49,910
dude,
why are you so much?

1720
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,010
That's ridiculous.
You know what's,

1721
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:57,080
what's the reason for that?
That's not cold in Canada there's a 

1722
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:57,080
tournament is more like a,
uh,

1723
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,780
George St Pierre type build.
Did you like to.

1724
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:03,640
That's how the gay more like,
um,

1725
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,440
James Irvin's build that would be a good
corner,

1726
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:09,980
like thick,
but it looks like an athlete,

1727
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,840
you know,
like a Herschel Walker.

1728
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:14,720
Herschel Walker.
How about that motherfucker?

1729
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:19,840
Forty seven years old.
Dude has his first MMA fight beat to 

1730
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:19,840
shit ass.
I'm young boy.

1731
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:24,230
Hershel Walker's 40 fucking seven dude.
And he looks like a Goliath.

1732
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:29,210
He's still just swole as fucking 
chiseled and just cut and dudes down.

1733
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,190
That guy's a suit.
That's a super athlete.

1734
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:36,370
They should be saving his DNA.
I don't know how many kids that guys 

1735
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:36,370
have.
How many kids do you have?

1736
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:38,060
Kids have no idea.
If he doesn't have kids they need to get

1737
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:41,180
the guy shoots him loads into some cops 
for sure.

1738
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,260
Right?
Don't you think?

1739
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:47,500
Get Him.
You imagine if you got Herschel Walker 

1740
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,530
and one of the Williams sisters and,
and,

1741
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:51,970
and they fell in love and I mean,
I don't know.

1742
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:57,010
No disrespect to her.
So I believe he's married and I don't 

1743
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:57,010
know if the Williams sisters are 
married.

1744
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:00,791
So let's just hypothetically make that 
and not in the real world is the fake 

1745
01:20:00,791 --> 01:20:00,791
world.
Nobody got upset,

1746
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,850
but I'm saying,
you know,

1747
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,970
you get to super athletes like that and 
put their genetics together.

1748
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:07,980
It'd be incredible.
Incredible.

1749
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:12,210
Like you ever know who Lucy a riker is 
lucy a rikers,

1750
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:17,211
a female boxer.
This chick could punch like harder than 

1751
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:17,211
men.
She was incredible.

1752
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:22,160
She was so good.
All the other female boxers avoided the 

1753
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:22,560
fuck out of her.
This is back in the Tonya harding days.

1754
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:26,220
This chip was like leaps and bounds 
above other female boxers.

1755
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:28,080
She was just a freak athlete,
right.

1756
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:30,540
I don't remember what nationality she 
was.

1757
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:34,330
I feel like I want to say something,
something Latin American or so,

1758
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:39,400
but she was from Holland,
but I don't remember what her 

1759
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,661
nationality.
I'm totally guessing she was a a dark 

1760
01:20:41,661 --> 01:20:44,031
skinned chick,
but God damn it was just this fucking 

1761
01:20:44,031 --> 01:20:44,031
freak athlete.
Just beat the fuck out of church.

1762
01:20:44,031 --> 01:20:46,170
She even fought dudes.
She got flatline though.

1763
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,050
She fought a dude and the dude 
connected.

1764
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:53,060
Our John just.
She went in [inaudible] 99 and it was 

1765
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:53,060
weird to see him because she was at 
attacking.

1766
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:57,520
She was trying to cut this dude down and
they do just bang and she just flatline,

1767
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:02,660
stiffened up and face planted.
But it looked like before the flat line,

1768
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:04,350
like she was getting the best of the 
dude.

1769
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:08,160
The dude just hit too hard.
There's a thing about bone structure.

1770
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:08,910
I think,
you know,

1771
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:10,140
like if you.
One of the things,

1772
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:11,670
if you meet someone,
meet a guy like this,

1773
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:14,460
like a big puncher,
like I met Michael Moore once.

1774
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,180
Michael Moore was the boxing heavyweight
champion of the world.

1775
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,500
And uh,
he was uh,

1776
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:21,240
the light heavyweight champion at one 
time too,

1777
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:23,670
for a long time.
It was bad ass as a light heavyweight.

1778
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:26,040
I just couldn't keep cutting the way he 
was too big,

1779
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,630
but it was like one of the best light 
heavyweights ever.

1780
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:30,800
But he's got like a frame,
like,

1781
01:21:30,801 --> 01:21:32,370
you meet that dude.
He's like frame.

1782
01:21:32,371 --> 01:21:33,500
It's heavy,
you know,

1783
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:38,501
his fists are heavy shoulders heavy.
That's the type of dude when he hits 

1784
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:38,501
you,
it's just,

1785
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:40,560
there's so much.
There's so much to him,

1786
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,270
you know what I'm saying?
And a check.

1787
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:47,330
Even if a chicken is really talented,
ultimately they're not built the same 

1788
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:47,790
way,
you know,

1789
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:50,610
so it just makes you think like a chick 
like that,

1790
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:51,990
like a Lucier,
weicker,

1791
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:57,200
you know,
matching her up with like an Anderson 

1792
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:57,200
Silva,
some other freak athlete,

1793
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,770
you know,
God damn,

1794
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,500
I sound like some sort of a genetic 
engineer.

1795
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:05,640
I'm trying to make future warriors.
It's going to happen.

1796
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:07,170
It is going to kind of be like,
well,

1797
01:22:07,171 --> 01:22:12,171
you know what's going to happen?
It's going to happen in a laboratory 

1798
01:22:12,171 --> 01:22:12,171
before it's going to happen with two 
people having sex.

1799
01:22:12,171 --> 01:22:15,850
Sex is not going to happen the old 
fashioned way with the gladiator meets 

1800
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:15,850
the warrior princess.
It's not gonna happen like that.

1801
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:18,300
The way it's going to happen now is you 
know you're going to,

1802
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,150
someone's going to take the attributes,
you're going to get some fat,

1803
01:22:21,151 --> 01:22:23,010
dumpy dude,
you know who's,

1804
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:25,440
who's got a little Dick,
but he's got a lot of money because he's

1805
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:30,441
crazy and he's invested all of his time 
to learning the stock market and 

1806
01:22:30,441 --> 01:22:33,801
swindling people and he's going to have 
children that are like psychotic warrior

1807
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:38,070
genius offspring because he's going to 
like manipulate all his shitty genes and

1808
01:22:38,071 --> 01:22:43,071
it's gonna create some super offspring 
and wanting to fucking his young wife 

1809
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:43,920
and killing him coming in.

1810
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:46,110
Yeah.
Brock Lesnar is Kona.

1811
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,090
That would be a real conan.
Yeah,

1812
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:53,091
that's a real cool.
And that's exactly what I'm talking 

1813
01:22:53,091 --> 01:22:54,831
about.
Like Brock Lesner is like somebody put 

1814
01:22:54,831 --> 01:22:54,831
that up there.
Whoever put that up there,

1815
01:22:54,831 --> 01:22:56,550
we lost her money in Japan.
Yeah,

1816
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,390
yeah.
Money.

1817
01:22:57,391 --> 01:22:58,950
Japan.
That's you're correct sir.

1818
01:22:58,951 --> 01:23:00,570
That's the perfect bill.
That's what you talking about.

1819
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,600
Just a big giant motherfucker doesn't 
look like a bodybuilder.

1820
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,100
Looks like a dude.
He'll smash you.

1821
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:06,880
You know,
like the best fighters.

1822
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:10,450
I don't want to say all of them,
but most of them don't.

1823
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:12,490
Look that ripped,
you know,

1824
01:23:12,491 --> 01:23:14,140
I think when you accept George St 
Pierre,

1825
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:16,000
he's fucking chiseled,
but like Bj,

1826
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:20,020
when he is in as best shape,
he still has like a good layer of fat on

1827
01:23:20,021 --> 01:23:22,360
him.
And Bj I think also has thick skin too.

1828
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,270
I think that's one of the reasons why Bj
doesn't cut that easy.

1829
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:26,230
You know,
nobody,

1830
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:31,500
nobody's got a tougher facing in Bj,
Bj and will fight like a fire round 

1831
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,830
fucking war and commander,
there were a couple of scratches,

1832
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:34,630
like it's crazy,
you know,

1833
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:35,500
I mean,
and they just,

1834
01:23:35,501 --> 01:23:37,210
that he's,
he's fucking awesome.

1835
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:38,290
Which it is.
I mean,

1836
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:43,291
he is,
but there's something about that dude's 

1837
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:43,291
genetics,
you know,

1838
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:43,330
everybody's there.
Everybody's got different genetics.

1839
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:48,750
So that's one of the most amazing things
about life is the variation amongst 

1840
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:49,660
human beings.
I mean,

1841
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:52,030
we vary so much more than any other 
animal.

1842
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:57,240
If you look at like the only animal that
comes close is dogs and dogs supposedly 

1843
01:23:57,701 --> 01:23:59,680
are like that because we engineered 
them,

1844
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:04,420
which makes you wonder what the fuck 
made so many people so different because

1845
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:06,540
we vary so much.
I mean,

1846
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:07,690
the,
the fact that,

1847
01:24:07,691 --> 01:24:08,110
uh,
uh,

1848
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:13,140
Chinese midget could have sex with 
Shaquille o'neal and make another baby 

1849
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:18,300
and that baby would look a combination 
of those two and there's that much 

1850
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,640
variation between pygmies and women from
Iceland,

1851
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:24,370
you know,
in like a muscle tones,

1852
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:29,260
ex wife Bridgette Nielsen,
that big giant Icelandic Nordic look and

1853
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:30,640
check,
you know,

1854
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:36,010
that,
that her and flavor flave they can have 

1855
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:36,010
babies,
you know,

1856
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:36,010
and they can.

1857
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:36,010
I mean,
they're so different.

1858
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:38,920
There's so much diversity.
There's no other animal like that except

1859
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:39,970
dogs,
you know,

1860
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:42,760
rhinos that looked like rhinos.
You know what I'm saying?

1861
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:48,270
Some fish look different and they,
you get a small mouth bass flux or a 

1862
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:49,120
large mouth bass.
They get crazy to get freaky with it,

1863
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:51,640
you know,
and you get a hybrid that's possible.

1864
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,540
Tigers and lions make loggers,
but for the most part,

1865
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:56,950
man,
human beings are.

1866
01:24:56,951 --> 01:24:59,590
We're the most diverse world,
weird fucking species.

1867
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:04,960
It's kind of incredible to,
when you think about the fact there's so

1868
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:07,330
many of us,
we think there's so many humans.

1869
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:10,450
You would think by now,
we'd all be a big fucking blurry mess.

1870
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:15,780
It's crazy when you see like countries 
like Asian countries where almost 

1871
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,530
everyone has a very similar appearance,
you know,

1872
01:25:17,531 --> 01:25:20,140
almost everyone has dark hair.
Almost everyone is,

1873
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:22,600
you know,
within a certain height rates changing.

1874
01:25:22,601 --> 01:25:25,030
Now I get Japan and making big giant 
dudes now.

1875
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:30,320
Big giant athletic dudes.
A lot of them are changing their diet 

1876
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:34,171
too.
I think it has something to do with 

1877
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:34,171
that.
Have you,

1878
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:34,171
you motherfucker.
What kind of showing running here,

1879
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:35,050
man,
the phone rang and how dare you.

1880
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,140
How dare you,
you do you do.

1881
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:42,460
What does this kind of fish I fuck talk 
ladies and gentlemen.

1882
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:47,490
What does that mean?
Or I shouldn't encourage that guy's 

1883
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:47,490
pocket.

1884
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:47,740
Not encouraging him.
Joe,

1885
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:52,741
talk about Nibiru folks.
I'm going to tell you right now and the 

1886
01:25:54,431 --> 01:25:56,770
bureau is not going to save you.
Okay?

1887
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,060
It's not happening.
It's not.

1888
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:00,880
It's a myth.
Not In the beer was a mess.

1889
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:03,100
I don't know if the bureaus are true,
but there's some.

1890
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:08,130
This is something that we have in our 
head about someone coming down and 

1891
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:08,160
fixing everything.
And uh,

1892
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:14,050
I don't think their shit's happening.
I think we're looking for daddy to come 

1893
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:17,411
down and throw down the rescue boat and 
pull us out of this mess and I think 

1894
01:26:17,411 --> 01:26:19,340
that's why people look at,
if you don't know what Nibiru this,

1895
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:21,640
there's people that,
there's people that believe that there's

1896
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,790
a planet that's in an elliptical orbit 
and every 3000,

1897
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:30,050
600 years it travels between Mars and 
Jupiter travels like very close to earth

1898
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,430
or between us and Mars rather.

1899
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:35,600
And this gigantic huge planet is 
responsible for many,

1900
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:38,120
many catastrophic events in Earth's 
history.

1901
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:43,121
And it's also responsible for these 
beings called the Annunaki to come from 

1902
01:26:43,121 --> 01:26:47,921
this planet and go on earth and create 
human beings with genetic engineering.

1903
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:51,200
I mean,
it's some fascinating shit.

1904
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:56,201
It's all from the Sumerian text in the 
Sumerian texts is the oldest known 

1905
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,460
written language.
It's like,

1906
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:01,820
it's called uniform and they write it 
and he's like little weird strokes.

1907
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,440
And they,
the,

1908
01:27:03,441 --> 01:27:05,780
they're one of the oldest civilizations 
that we know of.

1909
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,060
They had the first,
uh,

1910
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:10,040
astronomy,
the first astrology,

1911
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:15,041
including they had detailed depictions 
of the solar system with planets in all 

1912
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:20,831
the right orbits.
They had like Mars and Pluto even had 

1913
01:27:20,831 --> 01:27:24,131
pluto,
we didn't know about Pluto until 1970 

1914
01:27:24,131 --> 01:27:27,221
and they had a drawing of Pluto that was
carved into stone or that was rolled 

1915
01:27:27,221 --> 01:27:29,000
into a tablet 6,000
years ago,

1916
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:29,990
5,000
years ago.

1917
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,710
I mean,
it's really,

1918
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:33,900
really crazy stuff.
And when this guy,

1919
01:27:33,901 --> 01:27:38,901
Zacharias [inaudible],
and this is where it gets controversial 

1920
01:27:38,901 --> 01:27:42,220
because some guys who are scholars who 
are a language scientists and guys who 

1921
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:48,401
are archaeologists breaking down ancient
languages and trying to figure out the 

1922
01:27:48,401 --> 01:27:52,811
roots of the word,
they don't necessarily believe that 

1923
01:27:52,811 --> 01:27:52,811
citizens.
Right.

1924
01:27:52,811 --> 01:27:56,000
And I think that maybe he's leaped leapt
to some conclusions and his depictions.

1925
01:27:56,001 --> 01:27:56,210
Oh,
it's,

1926
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,140
I don't know.
I'm,

1927
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,020
I have no knowledge when it comes to 
foreign languages.

1928
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:01,340
So I don't understand the argument.
No.

1929
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:04,280
So I,
I see it back and forth and I.

1930
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,050
It's fascinating to me.
It's interesting.

1931
01:28:06,051 --> 01:28:07,520
You can't prove it.
Who the fuck knows?

1932
01:28:07,521 --> 01:28:11,450
But what is interesting is that culture,
the Samarian culture is crazy.

1933
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:12,950
They had the first,
everything,

1934
01:28:12,951 --> 01:28:16,340
the first mathematics,
they had the first use of the wheel.

1935
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,650
What the fuck bro.
Shut you shit off man.

1936
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:24,490
How dare you anyway.
Who the fuck knows what's more 

1937
01:28:24,741 --> 01:28:28,570
fascinating than this idea of a planet?
Because there's not enough evidence that

1938
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:33,580
there is another planet,
but there is enough evidence that these 

1939
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:33,580
people,
back then 6,000

1940
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:36,650
years ago,
had some amazing view of the world.

1941
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,270
They had some amazing technology they 
had.

1942
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:44,320
They knew about the DNA,
the double helix of the DNA that was 

1943
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:44,480
there.
Their signed for medicine.

1944
01:28:44,481 --> 01:28:46,130
They're signed for pharmacy.
They,

1945
01:28:46,131 --> 01:28:47,540
uh,
they drew a caduceus,

1946
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:50,330
which they still use today as a sign of 
medicine.

1947
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:51,860
That's crazy shit,
man.

1948
01:28:51,861 --> 01:28:54,430
They,
they had all these depictions of a,

1949
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,560
there was like large people with small 
people in their labs and the small 

1950
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:00,890
people had tails.
And you know,

1951
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,250
the,
the people that look at these goals,

1952
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:03,780
look,
this is genetic engineering,

1953
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:06,550
the giants they made in the monkey to 
the,

1954
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:09,930
the DNA of the alien.
They created this hybrid.

1955
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:15,500
Maybe.
Maybe they're just drawn a fucking big 

1956
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,811
guy with a monkey on his lap and make 
the monkey like curious George and 

1957
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:17,811
looked like a person.
You know,

1958
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:18,510
what the fuck man,
how do you,

1959
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,430
how can you tell me that?
That's exactly what that doesn't mean.

1960
01:29:20,431 --> 01:29:23,310
It could be like their cartoon.
There's their little character.

1961
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:28,580
This is the crazy monkey.
Looks like a human once asked stupid 

1962
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:29,910
questions,
sit in my lap and that could be it.

1963
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:30,150
Right?

1964
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,360
I forgot what your.
I can't bitch.

1965
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,220
You don't even pay attention to me 
anymore.

1966
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:39,630
He goes so deep into stuff that like 
halfway through I'm like,

1967
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:44,660
alright,
this is my brain is I can't even catch 

1968
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:44,660
up anymore.
To be honest with you.

1969
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:45,200
Half the time I don't know what I 
started talking about.

1970
01:29:45,201 --> 01:29:48,390
By the time I get to the end,
what I found is

1971
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,300
that I'm a conduit,
ladies and gentlemen.

1972
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:55,301
These thoughts come to me and I just 
have let a girl that's sort of sounds 

1973
01:29:55,301 --> 01:29:56,510
faggy.
That sounds completely factored,

1974
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,050
but that really is the truth.
You know,

1975
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:03,760
the better I get at comedy,
the more I feel like I'm not really 

1976
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,030
responsible for what I'm doing.
It's like I got to just do the work.

1977
01:30:05,031 --> 01:30:07,460
I got to write and I got to perform 
enough,

1978
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,380
but when I get it,
when I nail it,

1979
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:11,600
whatever it is that when I tuned back 
into the frequency,

1980
01:30:11,601 --> 01:30:13,130
whenever it is,
I just ride it.

1981
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:18,450
It's like it's,
it's almost like the easiest thing in 

1982
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:18,450
the world.
It's like it's difficult to maintain.

1983
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:22,660
It's you got to maintain your enthusiasm
and maintain your writing and maintain 

1984
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,290
your performing,
but when you're in that groove,

1985
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:26,180
when you lock in and it's the fucking 
show,

1986
01:30:26,181 --> 01:30:26,810
it's fun.

1987
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:30,020
When that's going on,
that's just a ride.

1988
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,490
You just ride the ride.
You're not,

1989
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:36,760
you're not doing anything.
I don't feel like it's like if I dig a 

1990
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:36,920
hole in the dirt in the backyard,
I feel like I just did something.

1991
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:38,510
You know?
I started at fucking hole.

1992
01:30:38,511 --> 01:30:41,060
It sucked every day,
but I got to the end.

1993
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:44,270
I get this feeling of satisfaction when 
I got off stage.

1994
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:46,160
I never had like a feeling of 
satisfaction.

1995
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:48,380
I always have a feeling of Ooh,
that was crazy.

1996
01:30:48,830 --> 01:30:52,400
Was like our road something.
Like I just got off a crazy ride.

1997
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,400
You know?
You don't know.

1998
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,640
Like I'd be like,
wow,

1999
01:30:55,641 --> 01:30:56,810
that was fun,
or that was,

2000
01:30:56,811 --> 01:30:58,280
that was cool.
That was great audience.

2001
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,830
But I never feel like I just did 
anything.

2002
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:03,380
I always feel like I just wrote a crazy 
ride,

2003
01:31:03,650 --> 01:31:05,030
you know,
that's what it feels like.

2004
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:10,450
Know,
it's like you have to do it enough so 

2005
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:12,600
that you're comfortable enough so that 
when you get up it's all smooth,

2006
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,390
you know,
and it's all fun.

2007
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:15,350
You know,
what you're talking about,

2008
01:31:15,351 --> 01:31:16,190
you know,
what you want to say,

2009
01:31:16,191 --> 01:31:21,191
you know,
and you're working on what you want to 

2010
01:31:21,191 --> 01:31:21,191
say all the time so that it's always 
fresh,

2011
01:31:21,191 --> 01:31:25,330
so it's always relevant in your mind.
So then who's the asm is there and it 

2012
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:29,131
didn't do zasmine is there,
and then the audiences enthusiastic and 

2013
01:31:29,131 --> 01:31:31,040
then you lock to those things together 
and then you just ride it.

2014
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,360
Once you get the laugh,
start going,

2015
01:31:32,361 --> 01:31:37,130
you just start writing it so much fun.
It's like you're skiing downhill.

2016
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:40,250
I think you're going to get a segway on 
your lap.

2017
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,200
If you live in mountains,
you can be like,

2018
01:31:43,201 --> 01:31:48,070
oh,
I've be to jump off right quick.

2019
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,490
I had a crazy Jaguar dream last night,
man.

2020
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:54,520
I had a dream that jaguars big ones.
We're trying to break into my house.

2021
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:58,870
I'm having very strange apocalyptic 
dreams lately.

2022
01:31:59,250 --> 01:31:59,760
No,
not,

2023
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,200
not serious ones because I survived the 
apocalypse.

2024
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:08,370
The retail apocalypse dream who's ever 
the end had been having dreams pretty 

2025
01:32:08,370 --> 01:32:11,200
much at all lately or ones once.
I remember for some reason.

2026
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,960
Yeah.
I get every now and then I get these,

2027
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,730
the system fails dreams,
you know,

2028
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,610
every now and then like some mad max 
type shit.

2029
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:21,330
Maybe it's just because all these 
assholes are screaming,

2030
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,950
the sky is falling.
You know,

2031
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,550
one of the things that's really 
interesting,

2032
01:32:24,551 --> 01:32:29,551
I was listening to some recordings of 
hunter s Thompson speaking at the 

2033
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:33,670
University of Colorado and it was like 
1974 and he was talking about,

2034
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,750
you know,
like the car,

2035
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:39,310
which is like supposedly the group of 
people that control the world,

2036
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,140
you know,
the global bankers,

2037
01:32:41,141 --> 01:32:42,550
the Bilderberg group,
that type of shit.

2038
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,740
And he was talking about,
uh,

2039
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,120
uh,
you know,

2040
01:32:46,121 --> 01:32:51,121
like what's going on overseas and what 
the United States is up to and how 

2041
01:32:51,121 --> 01:32:52,300
corrupt the political system is and how 
it's probably,

2042
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:54,430
you know,
if it goes this way much longer,

2043
01:32:54,431 --> 01:32:59,431
the country is going to fall apart,
but then you look at it like 30 years 

2044
01:32:59,431 --> 01:33:00,100
later,
it's still the same shit.

2045
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,320
It's still the same shit.
It's like,

2046
01:33:02,321 --> 01:33:03,550
is it getting any worse?
Well,

2047
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:08,551
there's more people,
so it seems to accelerate a little bit 

2048
01:33:08,551 --> 01:33:08,680
because there's more activity,
there's more humans,

2049
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:11,170
but it all seems to be going along the 
same lines.

2050
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,040
You know,
and this,

2051
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:17,041
the sky is falling crazy shit like 
really mean what takes something big 

2052
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:18,190
man.
And if it takes something big,

2053
01:33:18,191 --> 01:33:20,720
you're probably going to be dead anyway.
This guy is really gonna be following.

2054
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:23,080
It takes like a meteor.
We need like a volcano,

2055
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:25,030
like yellow stone,
which by the way,

2056
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,700
ready for this.
This is January 17th.

2057
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:31,390
There's been over 1,600
earthquakes in yellowstone.

2058
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:36,470
What the fuck is common?
If you don't know yellowstone is a giant

2059
01:33:36,471 --> 01:33:37,560
volcano.
See,

2060
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:40,400
nobody ever taught me this in school.
They ever teach you this in school.

2061
01:33:40,401 --> 01:33:42,130
Do you remember this?
Yeah.

2062
01:33:42,410 --> 01:33:44,620
Do you get the Caldera?
What would the.

2063
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,750
The whole volcano thing with then it's 
going to blow up.

2064
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:49,010
I think it's weird when you live there 
too.

2065
01:33:49,011 --> 01:33:52,250
It's like a lot of people can't live 
with it because they're in constant fear

2066
01:33:52,251 --> 01:33:53,020
of it too.
I've heard.

2067
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,650
How could you not?
I forget who it was.

2068
01:33:54,651 --> 01:33:58,790
I think it was a Adam Corolla or 
somebody or was talking about when I was

2069
01:33:58,791 --> 01:33:59,620
in high school.
I know.

2070
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:01,540
Well I'm older than you.
How old you?

2071
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:03,170
A $30.

2072
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:05,080
Shh.
Don't tell these people though.

2073
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:07,630
They're cruel from seven.
I'm seven years older than you.

2074
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:11,490
So you have to think about like if we 
were in high school,

2075
01:34:11,491 --> 01:34:13,030
like I was in high school earlier than 
you.

2076
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:16,060
They probably didn't even know yet 
because one of the things they found out

2077
01:34:16,061 --> 01:34:17,480
about with these,
um,

2078
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:22,550
yellowstone is a,
they had satellite images and when they 

2079
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:22,960
took the satellite images,
that's when they realized that what they

2080
01:34:22,961 --> 01:34:26,020
were dealing with was a called era,
which was a volcano.

2081
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:29,230
That was so explosive that the top 
literally disappeared,

2082
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:34,470
like be like Hawaii,
but Hawaii fucking explodes and it's 

2083
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:36,100
just flat.
I mean that's how big this volcano is.

2084
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:40,570
It's 300 miles across.
That's insane.

2085
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:45,990
And when it blows up,
you imagine 300 miles of explosion 

2086
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:46,570
straight up into the air.

2087
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:50,730
Everything will be okay here or will be 
fucked.

2088
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,540
The whole continent would be fucked.
We'd be fucked.

2089
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:54,770
But we would have like,
like a good,

2090
01:34:54,771 --> 01:34:58,040
like one hour slow lava or no,
it wouldn't be

2091
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,710
lava.
You'd be fucked because the ash wood rat

2092
01:35:00,711 --> 01:35:02,960
and fuck everything up.
It would kill animals.

2093
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:05,540
It would.
It would pollute the water supply.

2094
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:08,170
So what way would fuck everything you 
think about it?

2095
01:35:08,171 --> 01:35:10,430
How much it was?
It's like heavy,

2096
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:13,880
heavy [inaudible] is like snow.
Okay.

2097
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,120
Except it's much heavier.
So rooms would collapse.

2098
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:18,710
So you would get like,
you know,

2099
01:35:18,711 --> 01:35:23,711
two,
three feet of certain that would come 

2100
01:35:23,711 --> 01:35:23,711
down.
And even if you stayed inside your house

2101
01:35:23,711 --> 01:35:25,820
and relax,
your house would very likely get crushed

2102
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:30,821
from this fucking sit because there's 
certainly thousands and thousands of 

2103
01:35:30,821 --> 01:35:32,060
pounds on your roof.
So it's going to cave your fucking house

2104
01:35:32,061 --> 01:35:37,061
and you can't breathe outside.
The sky is filled with cert you don't 

2105
01:35:37,061 --> 01:35:39,410
understand everywhere and it's heavy,
thick shit.

2106
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,090
Volcanic ash,
soot.

2107
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,450
You're fucked.
You're fucked.

2108
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,010
And it covers the continent.
It comes over us.

2109
01:35:47,011 --> 01:35:49,550
Like I said,
the volcano.

2110
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,020
How long does it.
Do you have any?

2111
01:35:51,021 --> 01:35:52,640
They don't have any idea.
Well,

2112
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:56,570
they know that there's been smaller ones
where it's just killed a lot of things.

2113
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:01,660
And then there's been these gigantic 
earth shattering ones every six to 

2114
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:01,660
800,000
years.

2115
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:04,130
And the last time there was one with 
600,000

2116
01:36:04,131 --> 01:36:06,020
years ago.
What if it was something like,

2117
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:11,260
it wouldn't hit you for like a week and 
say you just get out and people will 

2118
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:11,630
segue there going,
fuck,

2119
01:36:11,631 --> 01:36:14,000
would you do.
You'd have to leave the continent yet.

2120
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:19,110
Well,
I think you could be okay if you could 

2121
01:36:19,110 --> 01:36:20,891
get off in North America to Europe.
Even if you knew that shit was going 

2122
01:36:20,891 --> 01:36:23,960
down and you could get on a plane and 
fly to England,

2123
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:29,170
just take your family and a crazy movie.
A evacuating the whole United States.

2124
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:30,290
Well,
you know,

2125
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:32,780
there's a,
there's a rock shelf in Africa,

2126
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:35,530
um,
that if it breaks off like it's,

2127
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:38,760
they have these underwater,
uh,

2128
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:43,990
these underwater landslides occur with 
these big shelves of these mountains 

2129
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:46,250
fall off and it's happened thousands of 
times throughout history.

2130
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,820
Well,
if this one particular rock flat,

2131
01:36:49,821 --> 01:36:54,821
this,
this whole area which they predict one 

2132
01:36:54,821 --> 01:36:57,251
day we'll break off and go into the,
the ocean is one particular side of a 

2133
01:36:57,251 --> 01:36:57,350
mountain.
If it does that,

2134
01:36:57,470 --> 01:37:02,240
it's gonna repeat a gigantic tsunami 
that engulfs the whole east coast of the

2135
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,770
United States,
like miles in.

2136
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:07,040
It's just going to just miles in water.
I mean,

2137
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:12,110
just a gigantic chunk of raw pouring 
into the ocean and these fucking waves 

2138
01:37:12,711 --> 01:37:17,711
that are like a mile high.
So it's going to roll in wreck 

2139
01:37:17,711 --> 01:37:17,711
everything.
It's going to be insane.

2140
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,200
Or it's just gonna be mildly irritating 
to be insane.

2141
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:24,000
It's going to be insane and it's 
probably gonna happen.

2142
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:24,710
Yeah.
You know,

2143
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:27,080
it might not happen in our lifetime,
but the,

2144
01:37:27,610 --> 01:37:32,610
but you can't say it was so against it.
So not though they probably are.

2145
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:35,810
There's so many things,
but there's so many things.

2146
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,090
Do there's so many different things.
The odds aren't against it.

2147
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:43,270
If you look at all of them together,
the odds aren't against it because if 

2148
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:43,400
you look at like meteors,
man,

2149
01:37:43,401 --> 01:37:45,500
they don't know when the fuck those are 
coming.

2150
01:37:45,501 --> 01:37:48,170
They have no idea how many asteroids are
out there,

2151
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:53,290
how many big chunks of fucking rock and 
metal and iron are flying through space 

2152
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:56,640
in any one of those Kojak us and they've
happened so many times over history.

2153
01:37:56,641 --> 01:38:01,641
It's been proven.
There's so many planets that are 

2154
01:38:01,641 --> 01:38:01,650
scattered with craters.
There's no way we can predict it.

2155
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:06,770
There's,
I mean they could monitor the sky and 

2156
01:38:06,770 --> 01:38:09,351
hope they catch most of them,
but there's always ones that are 

2157
01:38:09,351 --> 01:38:10,650
sneaking right bias that we miss and 
it's happening left and right man.

2158
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:12,670
Well,
when you black,

2159
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:15,180
what the fuck?
That's the government man.

2160
01:38:15,910 --> 01:38:19,110
Can you guys still hear us well?
Let's start recording.

2161
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:20,250
Hm?
Well,

2162
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:22,960
refresh your browser.
Refresh that.

2163
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:30,510
I don't even know what the fuck we're 
talking about.

2164
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,580
This is interrupted math.
Hello?

2165
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:34,860
Ladies and gentlemen.

2166
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:38,830
A long time scale.
Everything is inevitable.

2167
01:38:38,831 --> 01:38:39,590
Yeah,
that's,

2168
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:41,200
that's,
that's really,

2169
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,820
dude.
Just nailed it on the head.

2170
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:44,620
That guy money,
Japan again,

2171
01:38:44,621 --> 01:38:49,621
money,
Japan for the wind and motherfuckers 

2172
01:38:49,621 --> 01:38:49,621
raise money to have two good quotes.
He,

2173
01:38:49,621 --> 01:38:51,820
if he listened to that one is money,
money,

2174
01:38:51,821 --> 01:38:52,630
money,
money.

2175
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:55,630
And if you talked to Eddie about being 
in Japan and how cool it was.

2176
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,160
No,
he just got back last night.

2177
01:38:57,161 --> 01:39:00,010
I haven't seen him yet.
I would love to get to Japan and he,

2178
01:39:00,011 --> 01:39:01,270
um,
he's been to Japan,

2179
01:39:01,271 --> 01:39:03,160
but though he,
when he used to work for pride,

2180
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,590
what am I in Japan.
So yeah,

2181
01:39:05,591 --> 01:39:07,150
a long time scale.
Everything is inevitable.

2182
01:39:07,151 --> 01:39:12,151
That's what people have to realize.
Like we know for sure that human beings 

2183
01:39:12,151 --> 01:39:15,361
have a lifespan.
You're going to die as much as you plan 

2184
01:39:15,361 --> 01:39:15,850
for the future.
It's where you're going to die.

2185
01:39:16,210 --> 01:39:19,720
We know that planets have a lifespan as 
much as you plan for the future.

2186
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:22,990
Flagging signs eventually run into 
energy am I take billions of years,

2187
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:27,991
but it's going to happen.
And what we have to worry about is not 

2188
01:39:27,991 --> 01:39:29,470
just that,
not just earthquakes,

2189
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:32,320
not just super volcanoes,
not just media.

2190
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:34,840
We have to worry about gamma ray 
explosions.

2191
01:39:34,841 --> 01:39:39,841
We have to worry about supernovas that 
happen out in space that make these 

2192
01:39:39,841 --> 01:39:41,890
giant gamma ray bursts and fucking flood
the earth.

2193
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,100
Crushing all our communication systems,
crushing off satellites,

2194
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,250
breaking everything.
No wireless Internet,

2195
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,220
no oprah.
Everything shuts the fuck down.

2196
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:52,780
I mean,
that Shit's all possible.

2197
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,700
Giant,
crazy solar flares.

2198
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:56,950
There's a lot of shit that could fuck 
human beings up.

2199
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:58,480
You know,
there's a lot of shit,

2200
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:03,720
you know,
and they say that the polar ice caps 

2201
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:06,220
have shifted more than once in the past.
And they also say that 10,000

2202
01:40:06,221 --> 01:40:08,080
years ago,
during the last ice age,

2203
01:40:08,110 --> 01:40:12,130
the North American continent,
like half of it was under a mile of ice.

2204
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:14,680
I mean,
North America was fucked up,

2205
01:40:14,681 --> 01:40:15,940
dude.
It was all ice,

2206
01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:17,220
you know?
I mean,

2207
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,820
that's crazy shit.
That's only 10,000

2208
01:40:18,821 --> 01:40:19,540
years ago,
man.

2209
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:25,110
Crazy things can happen if.
How would we stop North America from 

2210
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:26,080
turning all ice again?
If the earth got that cold again,

2211
01:40:26,081 --> 01:40:27,850
what the fuck would we do?
What we do?

2212
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:30,190
Turn on the heat.
What the fuck would we do?

2213
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:35,430
What would we do if all of a sudden 
North America started turning into a 

2214
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:38,701
fucking mile high sheet wall of ice?
Odds are dinosaurs would come back 

2215
01:40:39,401 --> 01:40:40,450
first.
Why?

2216
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:41,800
Why do you say that?
I don't know why.

2217
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:43,080
Listen,
Brian,

2218
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:44,680
you can't give me.
That is what makes.

2219
01:40:44,681 --> 01:40:47,790
What makes these climate changes is very
mysterious.

2220
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:50,560
Most likely have nothing to worry about.
Maybe.

2221
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:51,580
Yes,
most likely,

2222
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:55,980
but there's been some gigantic things 
that happened to men at times.

2223
01:40:56,020 --> 01:41:01,020
I could.
I could freak out about that shit or I 

2224
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:01,020
could just be like,
hey,

2225
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:01,390
let's talk about real things that are 
freaking me out.

2226
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:03,750
Shit.
I gotta pay my bill tomorrow and do this

2227
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:06,160
tomorrow.
And I think people avoided though.

2228
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:11,310
I think people.
It's not just the fact that people 

2229
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:13,260
choose not to think about it.
I think they typically avoid it so they 

2230
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:13,260
don't ever have to think about like the,
the,

2231
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:15,460
the real,
the real big picture.

2232
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:18,160
The real big picture is very frightening
to a lot of people.

2233
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:23,250
And now there's the big picture.
Like what are you gonna do with your 

2234
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:23,250
life and you know you're going to get 
married,

2235
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:23,890
you're going to have kids going to get a
good job,

2236
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:28,950
you're gonna.
Be Able to put your kids through 

2237
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:28,950
college.
That's the,

2238
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:31,680
that's the real picture.
And then the big picture and the big 

2239
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,080
picture is what the fuck are we doing?
You know,

2240
01:41:32,081 --> 01:41:35,020
we're involved in two wars.
It's 2010.

2241
01:41:35,021 --> 01:41:40,021
This is the age of information we see 
everywhere that were being fucked left 

2242
01:41:40,021 --> 01:41:40,021
and right.

2243
01:41:40,021 --> 01:41:41,730
You know that your bailout money is 
going to these corporations,

2244
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,760
the corporation ceos are taking hundreds
of millions of dollars in payouts for 

2245
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,520
bonuses and all this insanity and you're
like,

2246
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:53,670
what fucking bonus like that.
They used the United States tax payers 

2247
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:55,210
money to bail out the company and now 
they get to get money.

2248
01:41:55,211 --> 01:41:57,820
They get bonuses,
big giant checks for what?

2249
01:41:57,821 --> 01:42:02,821
For fucking up.
Like what kind of a criminal 

2250
01:42:02,821 --> 01:42:02,821
organization is this and we're accepting
it.

2251
01:42:02,821 --> 01:42:05,410
What the fuck is this country running 
under?

2252
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:10,830
That's part a of the big picture.
And then part b of that picture is what 

2253
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:12,280
the fuck we're in space.
That's,

2254
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:15,250
that's the crazy one.
The Part B is we are,

2255
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:20,280
we are on a planet and this planet is 
one of an infinite amount of planets and

2256
01:42:21,211 --> 01:42:26,211
an infinite amount of solar systems and 
an infinite amount of galaxies spread 

2257
01:42:26,211 --> 01:42:30,601
throughout an infinite amount of space 
and that space and the universe itself 

2258
01:42:30,881 --> 01:42:33,160
may be some sort of a geometric pattern.

2259
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:36,940
That model is get on this face thing.
Well,

2260
01:42:36,941 --> 01:42:39,190
that's the most amazing thing.
I do always get on the space now,

2261
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,410
but it's because I get on those space 
thing in life.

2262
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,600
When I think about,
when I think about life,

2263
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:45,160
when I think about anything or I think 
about,

2264
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:50,270
you know,
Obama talking about gays in the 

2265
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:50,270
military,
we must repeal,

2266
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:50,270
don't ask,
don't tell.

2267
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:53,500
Finally Gay people go to die too.
Like this is nuts.

2268
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:57,220
Like who the fuck wants to be in the 
military now at this point in time,

2269
01:42:57,221 --> 01:42:58,360
they're saying to them,
you know,

2270
01:42:58,361 --> 01:42:59,130
like,
oh look,

2271
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:00,670
okay,
we need gay people.

2272
01:43:00,671 --> 01:43:05,671
Let's just be cool about this.
Gay people were running out of people 

2273
01:43:05,671 --> 01:43:05,990
who want to join the military.
Let's get some gay people in it too,

2274
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:07,440
right?
You know,

2275
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:09,160
the military,
I think in our,

2276
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:11,200
our grandparent's era,
you know,

2277
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:12,760
I think they were,
you know,

2278
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:17,850
they were at least less under the 
illusion that they were getting fucked.

2279
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:23,430
You know this,
I've talked to so many dudes that come 

2280
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:23,430
back and are so disillusioned.
You know,

2281
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:25,750
that Pat Tillman Guy,
that's the best example ever.

2282
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:30,870
There's a dude who's a NFL football star
who decides that he wants to go fight 

2283
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:32,470
for his country.
The nopal list of virtues.

2284
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:37,650
You know,
for a man to want to represent his 

2285
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:38,080
country in a time of need to realize 
that he has to step up.

2286
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:41,590
That there are certain times in history 
where men have to do things and fuck all

2287
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:46,591
the glory for being an nfl player.
He's going to do the right thing and 

2288
01:43:46,591 --> 01:43:48,190
fight for his country and he goes over 
there and gets killed in friendly fire,

2289
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:51,680
accidentally gets Kennedy quick,
make it work.

2290
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:57,180
Crazy thing was how quickly he was 
talking about how fucked up it is over 

2291
01:43:57,180 --> 01:44:00,221
there and how disillusion he is and how 
it's a mess and his brothers talking 

2292
01:44:00,221 --> 01:44:04,151
about it and they completely incompetent
and he was talking about how just 

2293
01:44:04,151 --> 01:44:04,550
completely unorganized it is over there 
and,

2294
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:08,480
and chaotic and how he didn't believe in
what he,

2295
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:10,730
what he joined up for the army in the 
first place.

2296
01:44:10,830 --> 01:44:12,290
It was,
he was being tracked and that's not what

2297
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:14,570
it was.
And it was fascinating,

2298
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,220
fascinating fucking story,
you know,

2299
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:18,860
and that represents everything that's 
best about America.

2300
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:22,640
Like a guy who is willing to look at it 
and say,

2301
01:44:22,641 --> 01:44:24,800
man,
I need to fucking do something.

2302
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:26,870
Fuck all his football plan.
I'm going to go over there.

2303
01:44:26,871 --> 01:44:28,910
I want to make a difference.
And then when he gets there,

2304
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,650
he's man enough to go,
oh shit,

2305
01:44:30,651 --> 01:44:33,220
this is a mess.
Like this is not what I wanted.

2306
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:35,030
I'm not gonna.
I'm not going to be United States.

2307
01:44:35,031 --> 01:44:36,800
This bitch over there.
So this is craziness.

2308
01:44:36,801 --> 01:44:38,600
This is chaos.
And then

2309
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:39,550
he's dead.

2310
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:42,610
Which is what happens,
man.

2311
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:44,430
You know,
you got to fucking war people died.

2312
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:46,900
It's terrible,
but it's just at this point in time,

2313
01:44:46,901 --> 01:44:48,040
man,
you know,

2314
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,020
there's gotta be better ways around 
this.

2315
01:44:50,170 --> 01:44:53,680
There's gotta be better ways to and I 
don't know what the fuck they are.

2316
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,750
What are you doing with that shit back?
So we could see each other.

2317
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:01,930
I want to read the fucking truck,
man.

2318
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,740
They'll be going on TMZ,
you know,

2319
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:06,950
but I'm looking at yours so I don't do 
like that.

2320
01:45:06,951 --> 01:45:11,951
So we don't look at two totally 
different things that are a couple of 

2321
01:45:11,951 --> 01:45:11,951
weird geeks.
What about the ether?

2322
01:45:11,951 --> 01:45:16,470
Who's doing the either?
That was a good Nazan I'm getting into 

2323
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:20,170
Nas again lately.
Nice to move on,

2324
01:45:20,171 --> 01:45:21,470
man.
You should listen to a kid.

2325
01:45:21,471 --> 01:45:21,930
Cuddy?
No,

2326
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:24,440
there's some good.
There's some good music.

2327
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,880
I Hate Nizam.
I've overheard too much of his stuff 

2328
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:29,880
now.
Oh,

2329
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:33,100
don't be a bitch.
She don't get sick of the same music or 

2330
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:33,100
I do,
but I liked.

2331
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,310
I liked going back to it on occasion.
Yeah.

2332
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,300
Yeah.
I tried to listen to Nas recently,

2333
01:45:37,301 --> 01:45:38,860
but it was like,
how dare you.

2334
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:39,760
Kate cuddy though.

2335
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,790
I recommend kid cuddie kid cutting.
What does kid cuddy do?

2336
01:45:42,791 --> 01:45:46,510
This kid cutting smooth little wrapper.
Okay.

2337
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,580
This is the song.
Whenever I travel,

2338
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:52,720
this is the move he eat a cookie like 
right before you get to the airport.

2339
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:55,420
So then any board,
you're not riding dirty.

2340
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,910
You have to worry about anybody arrested
him.

2341
01:45:57,390 --> 01:45:59,710
He doesn't even kick in until like an 
hour into the flight,

2342
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:01,540
you know,
an hour into the flight,

2343
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:05,020
Dan Daniel barbecued,
and then that's the best way to fly.

2344
01:46:05,021 --> 01:46:08,830
I mean suddenly you're operating heavy 
machinery or you're going to think about

2345
01:46:08,831 --> 01:46:10,210
yourself.
You're going to think about life.

2346
01:46:10,211 --> 01:46:15,211
You can think about a lot of deep,
important shit when you're high on an 

2347
01:46:15,211 --> 01:46:15,211
airplane.
That's the only way I travel.

2348
01:46:15,211 --> 01:46:16,600
This is the best way to do it,
but then when I land,

2349
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:21,310
every time I land Atlanta this song,
think about yourself.

2350
01:46:21,311 --> 01:46:23,640
You've got to think a little deeper.
Let's.

2351
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:24,610
Woops.
That's me.

2352
01:46:24,611 --> 01:46:25,830
There's a delay.
I don't want to listen to that.

2353
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:38,340
This hip hop is dead song by now.
This is the best barbecue.

2354
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:47,460
Contemplating your role,
overseeing all these different 

2355
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:47,460
characters.
Walking through the airport,

2356
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:53,740
Dr Dre headphones on and I get it down 
before I don't like this,

2357
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:03,100
but I've heard it a million times.
Shit,

2358
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:08,440
same shit over and over like new music.
This is the God damn

2359
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,250
classic.
Look at this thing.

2360
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:15,610
It's like Nirvana would be the.
Somebody tells me what the fuck is wrong

2361
01:47:15,611 --> 01:47:16,930
with ustream?
Ustream,

2362
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:17,950
get it together.
People.

2363
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:21,370
I know you're free.
This shit is wack.

2364
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:23,740
Can I read this social stream?
Yes.

2365
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:27,520
Ryan.
L Egg 10.

2366
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:28,970
I can.
But uh,

2367
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:31,870
here's the deal son.
We've got to keep this bitch flowing and

2368
01:47:31,871 --> 01:47:36,871
sometimes we're going to look at what 
you have to say and sometimes we're not 

2369
01:47:36,871 --> 01:47:36,871
know.
There's no rhyme or reason.

2370
01:47:36,871 --> 01:47:38,320
Don't get crazy.
Don't spam.

2371
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:43,410
Let the universe that the University of 
guide

2372
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:51,180
just went down a notch in my book 
jamming to that.

2373
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,570
The other side I like to listen to in 
all fairness,

2374
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:56,220
is Jimi Hendrix.
Voodoo child.

2375
01:47:56,221 --> 01:47:58,980
That's another bad ass landing song.
I used to have.

2376
01:47:58,981 --> 01:48:03,981
That one is my main one.
I would land and listen to what the 

2377
01:48:03,981 --> 01:48:04,590
other one is a little gay.
Tori Amos,

2378
01:48:04,591 --> 01:48:07,260
crucify.
I liked that song,

2379
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:14,740
that song.
I like it landed in the Tori Amos House.

2380
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:21,060
Heavy.
Her playing the piano.

2381
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:24,160
Oh,
sexy on white sheets.

2382
01:48:24,161 --> 01:48:25,500
Like sheets.
She's white.

2383
01:48:26,710 --> 01:48:31,710
I get to see you in your car with your a
fanny pack and pack on blasting out the 

2384
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:36,351
Tori Amos.
Most of the time I don't drive in my 

2385
01:48:36,351 --> 01:48:38,541
fanny pack on.
The only time I do is when I'm on the 

2386
01:48:38,541 --> 01:48:38,541
way to the airport.

2387
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:40,650
People like give the fanny pack a hard 
time.

2388
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:43,100
Matt Serra.
I saw you on your,

2389
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:45,840
your video blog,
which is fucking hilarious.

2390
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:50,960
Leading up to this week's UFC and I'm 
very much looking for do you fight with 

2391
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:54,261
frank trigg?
But I saw you coming down with a fanny 

2392
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:54,261
pack,
my brother and you got to let it go.

2393
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:55,190
Not Wrong with fanny pack.
Okay.

2394
01:48:55,290 --> 01:49:00,290
Y'All reason there is something wrong 
with a fanny pack is because you know 

2395
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:00,290
you can't get laid if you wear a fanny 
pack.

2396
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:04,940
So who gives a fuck?
Anybody that want to fuck you because 

2397
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:05,670
you wear a fanny pack,
you don't want them.

2398
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:08,850
That's what I have to say.
That's a functional piece of wardrobe.

2399
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:13,910
It's excellent.
You fucking strap that bitch on right 

2400
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:13,910
there and you've got all your shit right
here.

2401
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:14,820
It's nice.
It's right there.

2402
01:49:14,821 --> 01:49:16,170
You go to the airport and you take it 
off.

2403
01:49:16,230 --> 01:49:18,390
Bam.
You walked through the metal detector.

2404
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:19,770
Not saying you have to wear it every 
day,

2405
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:21,930
but if I were it,
fuck you man.

2406
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:23,490
Fuck you.
I got a fanny pack on boy.

2407
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:26,050
That shit on stage before people get all
angry.

2408
01:49:26,051 --> 01:49:27,850
I think it's a prop.
You sent a proud.

2409
01:49:27,851 --> 01:49:31,020
This is my fanny pack bench.
It seems like it would be a prop.

2410
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:33,030
Yeah,
because it's very unstylish,

2411
01:49:33,031 --> 01:49:36,050
but guess what I'm.
The reality is I'm a 42 year old married

2412
01:49:36,051 --> 01:49:41,051
dude with a,
with a family trying to come at you 

2413
01:49:41,051 --> 01:49:41,070
trying to cover.
You're not trying to fuck you.

2414
01:49:41,071 --> 01:49:44,670
I'm trying to walk into the airport 
which is trying to cover your hog.

2415
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,060
I'm Daniel.
We're gonna.

2416
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:47,590
Have to pull that

2417
01:49:49,390 --> 01:49:51,940
fanny packs.
Haida bone or really well now my bone or

2418
01:49:51,941 --> 01:49:53,950
bitch.
Maybe your boner.

2419
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,070
Maybe.
I guess maybe maybe it would hurt if you

2420
01:50:00,071 --> 01:50:05,071
had like a cell phone digging into your 
deck as I like more of like a little 

2421
01:50:05,071 --> 01:50:09,511
backpack slingbox.
It's very rare that I walk with boners 

2422
01:50:09,511 --> 01:50:10,930
anymore though was when I was a younger 
man.

2423
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:13,240
Boners like,
you know,

2424
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:14,740
walking through the airport for some 
reason.

2425
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:18,100
Just got this random boner cooking that 
don't get those random boaters anymore.

2426
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:21,340
I get morning loners but I'll get no 
random daytime boners.

2427
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:25,140
Especially if I do a lot of Jujitsu and 
that's mixed Jujitsu.

2428
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:28,000
Sound very gay because it kills your 
boner I guess I never was.

2429
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:31,030
There'll be do a lot of Jujitsu.
You're tired all the time.

2430
01:50:31,031 --> 01:50:36,031
Your testosterone's down,
you know you're worn out and if you get 

2431
01:50:36,031 --> 01:50:38,410
laid all the time,
do those two things.

2432
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,330
Keep your bonus from just occurring 
randomly.

2433
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:43,000
But if you're not getting laid and 
you're not even working out,

2434
01:50:43,001 --> 01:50:45,750
you're not doing anything,
your bonus would just start firing away.

2435
01:50:45,950 --> 01:50:50,950
It's fuck who fucked bro.
If you're not paying attention,

2436
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:54,390
have,
you know,

2437
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:56,310
given your dick the proper maintenance 
work.

2438
01:50:56,490 --> 01:51:01,490
And you know,
I had a joke that was in one of my cds 

2439
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:01,490
from way back,
I don't remember which one,

2440
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:05,690
I think it was shiny happy Jihad.
It was a day you got to jerk off first 

2441
01:51:05,690 --> 01:51:06,600
and then think about what you're doing.
You should always do that.

2442
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:09,120
It's really important because your 
biology will trick you.

2443
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:14,300
Your biology will have you convinced 
that you should go file some crazy girl 

2444
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:17,961
home,
live in a bad neighborhood and leave 

2445
01:51:17,961 --> 01:51:19,671
your car on the,
on the corner and her cousin's going to 

2446
01:51:19,671 --> 01:51:19,671
watch it.
Like,

2447
01:51:19,671 --> 01:51:19,890
why?
Because you're Horny,

2448
01:51:19,891 --> 01:51:21,390
you know,
you'll do some dumb shit.

2449
01:51:21,391 --> 01:51:23,280
You'll do some silly shit,
you know?

2450
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:28,400
And if you jerk off,
you're much less likely to do any of 

2451
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:28,400
that.
Keep every play racquetball.

2452
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:33,420
No.
That's the funny thing you say that 

2453
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:35,001
because I was just at a gym the other 
day that had all these racquetball 

2454
01:51:35,001 --> 01:51:37,641
courts and I was like,
that was one of the first times I've 

2455
01:51:37,641 --> 01:51:37,641
ever seen racquetball and I was reading 
a long time.

2456
01:51:37,641 --> 01:51:37,641
Now

2457
01:51:37,641 --> 01:51:38,830
you would seem like a scary racket ball 
partner.

2458
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:40,190
You'd be one of those,

2459
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,460
man,
this is why I don't like my racquetball.

2460
01:51:44,461 --> 01:51:45,920
I've had two knee surgeries.
Yeah,

2461
01:51:45,930 --> 01:51:50,930
yeah.
I bet both of my acl reconstructed and 

2462
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:53,160
my had another a meniscus surgery on my 
left knee and they work great.

2463
01:51:53,161 --> 01:51:56,120
Now I'm like,
I have no problem doing Jujitsu and it's

2464
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,400
their fun and it's fine,
but I think if I did stuff like that,

2465
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:01,620
like cutting back and forth all the 
time,

2466
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:03,990
you run the risk of injuring yourself,
you know,

2467
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:09,500
Jujitsu.
I can kinda control the movements a 

2468
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:09,500
little bit more.
Especially if you pulled guard and he,

2469
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,370
you know,
he control where your legs are going.

2470
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:13,740
You know when you're going back and 
forth like that,

2471
01:52:13,741 --> 01:52:18,741
you're putting a tremendous amount of 
pressure on your joints and your 

2472
01:52:18,741 --> 01:52:19,170
explosive movement like that.
It's really,

2473
01:52:19,171 --> 01:52:20,070
it's like,
you know,

2474
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:25,100
it's,
it's an interesting thing to watch 

2475
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:26,871
athletically,
but like for your body eventually that 

2476
01:52:26,871 --> 01:52:26,871
Shit's going to where the fuck out of,
you know,

2477
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:28,380
you know,
what's the craziest thing,

2478
01:52:28,381 --> 01:52:28,590
man?

2479
01:52:28,590 --> 01:52:30,540
So you see like old football players,
man,

2480
01:52:30,690 --> 01:52:34,440
you got to respect the fucking 
dedication that goes into that sport.

2481
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:37,020
The amount of pain those guys have to 
deal with.

2482
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:40,590
Those guys get fucking clipped.
You know what I mean?

2483
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:43,740
Some fucking football games that you 
see,

2484
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:48,890
like we see the clips on youtube where 
dudes are running full steam and just 

2485
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:54,980
right into another dude and send him 
smashing into the ground and another guy

2486
01:52:54,981 --> 01:52:57,600
fucking piles into it.
At the same time you're watching.

2487
01:52:57,610 --> 01:53:00,200
You just go,
Jesus Christ,

2488
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,820
your body,
your fucking bond.

2489
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:07,870
Just gonna get mangled.
And some of these guys like wanting 

2490
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:07,870
back.
So like not that big dudes.

2491
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:10,190
You know these big fucking gorilla.
You're trying to get at them.

2492
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:14,060
Wooo.
Football's a crazy ass game man.

2493
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:17,750
You know when football will be the shit 
when they can fix any injury,

2494
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:20,630
anything they have,
anything that happens,

2495
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:25,040
they just zap you and it's like they 
have apple backup for your hard drive.

2496
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:30,040
That's all we have for your life right 
before you go in and do anything 

2497
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:30,040
dangerous.
They back up your life,

2498
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:30,770
you know,
like a couple of weeks ago,

2499
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:32,540
and then they reload your back into the 
grid.

2500
01:53:32,541 --> 01:53:32,840
Like,
oh,

2501
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:33,860
I'm back.
Did you die?

2502
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:34,670
Die,
die,

2503
01:53:34,671 --> 01:53:35,600
dude,
I fucked up.

2504
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:38,090
You know I got crazy.
You know,

2505
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,700
how crazy would that be?
I mean,

2506
01:53:40,701 --> 01:53:43,040
look,
if you believe in like Ray Kurtzweil and

2507
01:53:43,041 --> 01:53:48,041
these futurists that believed that one 
day we're going to be able to download 

2508
01:53:48,041 --> 01:53:50,981
consciousness into a computer,
I mean at a certain point in time it 

2509
01:53:50,981 --> 01:53:54,881
becomes.
The real question becomes what is 

2510
01:53:54,881 --> 01:53:57,341
reality?
Then if your downloaded into a computer 

2511
01:53:57,341 --> 01:53:57,710
who keeps the computer on the computers,
keep the computers on,

2512
01:53:57,860 --> 01:54:01,270
and then we're part of this new life,
this new world that exists inside of Huc

2513
01:54:01,271 --> 01:54:06,271
and machine,
and then your consciousness exists in a 

2514
01:54:06,271 --> 01:54:06,620
machine and what happens to the original
version of your consciousness?

2515
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,930
What does guy I have planned for you?
After you die?

2516
01:54:08,931 --> 01:54:12,070
Do you really go into some great well of
souls and you know,

2517
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:14,510
and go to the next stage of existence.
Does that happen?

2518
01:54:14,511 --> 01:54:17,210
And if that does happen and you're 
already downloaded into the machine,

2519
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:19,760
does the well of souls except you or the
wellstone goes,

2520
01:54:19,761 --> 01:54:24,761
listen bitch,
I don't accept software piracy up in 

2521
01:54:24,761 --> 01:54:27,731
heaven.
He can't be copying my shit and put it 

2522
01:54:27,731 --> 01:54:27,731
on bit torrent down on earth and have it
all these,

2523
01:54:27,731 --> 01:54:28,250
you know.
C'Mon man,

2524
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:29,390
you're time's up,
bitch.

2525
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,950
It's over.
You have to move on.

2526
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:32,870
You know,
maybe it doesn't accept you if there's a

2527
01:54:32,871 --> 01:54:35,210
version of you running this parallel 
dimension,

2528
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:37,820
maybe having one except you because you 
gotta you gotta let go.

2529
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:41,780
But that's the whole idea of living and 
dying is to know that this is a stage.

2530
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:42,770
Don't be greedy.

2531
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:46,010
Don't try to live for a thousand years.
Just get the fuck out of here.

2532
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:47,000
Go,
go,

2533
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:47,690
go,
go.

2534
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:50,990
Don't download yourself.
Not makes you know,

2535
01:54:51,290 --> 01:54:54,410
it's almost like a kid who wants to go 
down the slide and he's holding onto the

2536
01:54:54,411 --> 01:54:59,411
back of the slide and he wants to go 
down the slide and hold on at the same 

2537
01:54:59,411 --> 01:54:59,411
time.
Well you can't.

2538
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:02,750
Did he go down a slide or you hold on,
you'd be a bitch.

2539
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:08,020
So either downloads or something,
a computer live forever or you see 

2540
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:08,020
what's next.
Like,

2541
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:11,720
like you're supposed to write.
Aubrey de Grey believes we will live 

2542
01:55:13,221 --> 01:55:15,260
forever in biological form.
Yeah,

2543
01:55:15,261 --> 01:55:20,261
I've seen that guy,
that professor Aubrey de Grey Day 

2544
01:55:20,261 --> 01:55:22,901
sleeper in 1988.
He's that crazy English dude with the 

2545
01:55:22,901 --> 01:55:23,180
big long crazy beard who drinks a lot of
beer.

2546
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,980
Yeah,
he's a fascinating guy.

2547
01:55:24,981 --> 01:55:26,010
He's a,
um,

2548
01:55:26,230 --> 01:55:27,230
you know,
some crazy,

2549
01:55:27,231 --> 01:55:32,231
mad scientist,
genius character who is working on a 

2550
01:55:32,231 --> 01:55:33,940
changing human beings at the molecular 
level level to,

2551
01:55:33,941 --> 01:55:35,060
uh,
to prevent aging,

2552
01:55:35,061 --> 01:55:38,900
the change agent and working all these 
different science for our anti aging.

2553
01:55:38,930 --> 01:55:42,470
And the idea is that if you can survive 
for a few years,

2554
01:55:42,471 --> 01:55:43,720
the next 20,
30 years,

2555
01:55:43,721 --> 01:55:44,060
so you're

2556
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:47,070
likely that you could live forever,
which is really crazy.

2557
01:55:47,090 --> 01:55:51,300
It's just insane to think about like so 
many people as it is right now,

2558
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:54,570
you know?
Did you see Pandora them by the way?

2559
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:57,140
Unsolicited plug here.
Hold on a second.

2560
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:00,520
I'm going to grab this.

2561
01:56:07,230 --> 01:56:09,030
I watched this the other night on Blu 
Ray.

2562
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:14,060
It's called Pandora them.
And this is a movie that a con Lee is 

2563
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:14,060
in.
And that's,

2564
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:15,180
I think how I found out about it the 
first time.

2565
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:20,540
And then a dude named angry Amadeus on 
my message board made a post about it 

2566
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:22,490
and he's a pretty smart guy and he was 
talking about how great it was.

2567
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:23,010
I said,
all right,

2568
01:56:23,011 --> 01:56:23,780
fuck it.
I'll give it a try.

2569
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:24,410
Like,
okay.

2570
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,860
As an intelligent dude.
And it's a,

2571
01:56:26,861 --> 01:56:30,350
a space horror film and a Conley,
isn't it?

2572
01:56:30,351 --> 01:56:34,110
Dennis Quaid is in it and pretty God 
damn fucking good movie man.

2573
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:35,850
What is it?
Pretty Fun fucking movie.

2574
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:41,090
It's a horror movie and space.
Kind of surprised that it didn't get 

2575
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:42,210
more people into it.
It was good.

2576
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,270
What's the rotten tomatoes score?
I didn't even look.

2577
01:56:45,271 --> 01:56:48,500
Let's look.
The rotten tomatoes score for Pandora.

2578
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:51,840
I pretty much trust that shit.
Rotten tomatoes.

2579
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:54,600
Yeah,
it's pretty good.

2580
01:56:54,650 --> 01:56:56,070
It's pretty accurate.
Usually.

2581
01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:02,320
What do I think about the nexus one?
I think it's got a lot of problems now,

2582
01:57:02,321 --> 01:57:07,321
but once it comes to verizon,
it might be interesting to see what 

2583
01:57:07,321 --> 01:57:07,321
happens.

2584
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:10,340
I'm kind of more excited about the tour 
to now.

2585
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:12,380
I think what the thing about the tour 
too,

2586
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:14,450
which means a lot to me,
is that,

2587
01:57:14,451 --> 01:57:15,590
uh,
it's a world phone.

2588
01:57:15,591 --> 01:57:20,591
I need a world hot travel bitch.
I'm international and was saying 

2589
01:57:20,591 --> 01:57:20,960
sometimes I'll be visiting my homies in 
the UK,

2590
01:57:21,530 --> 01:57:26,530
Twenty eight percent tomatoes,
28 percent damn consensus.

2591
01:57:26,571 --> 01:57:30,230
While my approve somewhat satisfying for
devout Scifi fans.

2592
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:35,390
Pandora was bloated.
Derivative plot an ultimately leaves it 

2593
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:36,410
drifting in space.
Okay.

2594
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:38,030
I completely disagree.
Yes.

2595
01:57:38,031 --> 01:57:40,220
It was not perfect,
nor was avatar.

2596
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,410
I'm not looking for perfect movies 
anymore.

2597
01:57:42,411 --> 01:57:44,870
I'm looking for an escape.
I'm looking for some fun.

2598
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:47,360
If I want to be intellectually 
stimulated,

2599
01:57:47,361 --> 01:57:49,370
it's not going to be from your gay 
fucking movie.

2600
01:57:49,371 --> 01:57:54,371
Okay.
It's going to be from a documentary is 

2601
01:57:54,371 --> 01:57:56,801
going to be from some real life shit.
It's going to be from something on 

2602
01:57:56,801 --> 01:57:56,801
space.
If I'm watching a movie,

2603
01:57:56,801 --> 01:58:00,170
I want crazy shit with monsters and 
explosions.

2604
01:58:00,171 --> 01:58:05,171
I don't want to excitement and I want 
some tits and that movie had all that 

2605
01:58:05,171 --> 01:58:07,040
click on top critics and read some of 
the bitch was kicking everyone's ass.

2606
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:08,100
Top critics.
Yeah.

2607
01:58:08,101 --> 01:58:13,101
And then read some of just little blurbs
from what their reviews are because I'm 

2608
01:58:13,101 --> 01:58:13,550
kind of interested to see if.
Because if you'd like it so much,

2609
01:58:13,551 --> 01:58:15,050
what they have to say about it.

2610
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:21,910
Hm.

2611
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:25,970
Throughout some obvious questions pop up
immediately.

2612
01:58:25,971 --> 01:58:27,260
Yeah,
no kidding.

2613
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:29,930
Jesus Christ folks.
Lazy.

2614
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:31,610
Derivative.
Perhaps.

2615
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:33,290
Perhaps a bit,
but.

2616
01:58:33,291 --> 01:58:34,370
So what,
man?

2617
01:58:34,371 --> 01:58:38,630
It's like a fucking cheeseburger.
Tori Amos in soundtrack.

2618
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:39,470
How dare.

2619
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:44,560
Listen folks.
Yeah,

2620
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:45,550
it's.
You know what?

2621
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:47,770
I'm looking forward to the wolf man.
Okay.

2622
01:58:47,890 --> 01:58:49,990
The wolf man with Benicio del Toro's 
coming out.

2623
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:55,230
I know the fucking plot.
I know it's been done a thousand times 

2624
01:58:55,230 --> 01:58:56,230
before.
I don't give a shit.

2625
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,510
I want some escape.
I want to see the wolf man.

2626
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:01,850
I want to see like it's an old school.
Wolf men too.

2627
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:03,820
It's going to be bad.
And you like the old ones?

2628
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:05,080
Yeah,
I loved all of them.

2629
01:59:05,081 --> 01:59:07,120
Dude.
I loved American Werewolf in London.

2630
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:09,610
I loved the old wolf man.
I'd love.

2631
01:59:09,611 --> 01:59:11,740
There's so many different ones that came
out.

2632
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,920
You know,
there hasn't been a good one in a long 

2633
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:16,920
time though.
Those likened movies,

2634
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:20,050
the vampires and the fucking.
Those are cool looking werewolves.

2635
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:22,590
They're kind of crazy looking,
but they're so CGI that's.

2636
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:24,670
It's hard to take them serious.
They look dope,

2637
01:59:24,671 --> 01:59:26,770
but they look fake as fuck,
you know?

2638
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:32,100
Anyway,
a lot of people felt that movie sucked 

2639
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:32,400
and you might think it sucks to be a 
huge team wolf fan.

2640
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,660
No,
but I like some science fiction.

2641
01:59:34,661 --> 01:59:36,700
I love horror and science fiction 
movies,

2642
01:59:36,730 --> 01:59:39,310
aliens like that kind of old school 
aliens.

2643
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:41,470
Now.
This was one that was like that,

2644
01:59:41,471 --> 01:59:42,880
that I hadn't seen,
so it was fun,

2645
01:59:42,881 --> 01:59:44,200
man.
I'll watch that shit again.

2646
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:46,030
I liked it.
I liked that.

2647
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:50,410
I liked to stupid shit.
Stupid Shit is not always bad folks.

2648
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,840
It's like what I was saying about 
cheeseburgers.

2649
01:59:51,841 --> 01:59:56,841
Sometimes you want a fucking hot dog.
Sometimes you need to gourmet meal and 

2650
01:59:56,841 --> 02:00:00,271
you want to have a nice healthy salad 
first and we'll have spring water with 

2651
02:00:00,271 --> 02:00:00,640
lemon in it.
You want to feel good about yourself.

2652
02:00:00,641 --> 02:00:05,641
You want to feel sometimes you want to 
fucking hot dog and you want a hot dog 

2653
02:00:05,641 --> 02:00:05,641
with Chili on it.

2654
02:00:05,641 --> 02:00:06,460
All right,
and that Shit's good when you want it.

2655
02:00:06,461 --> 02:00:11,461
It's good.
He notes pig ass holes and the horse 

2656
02:00:11,461 --> 02:00:12,490
dicks.
You don't give a fuck if it tastes good.

2657
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:15,190
And when we got sauerkraut in it and 
mustard,

2658
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:18,580
that's what this fucking movie.
I live by a wiener Schnitzel.

2659
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:20,270
And have you ever been there?
I think so.

2660
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,330
It's amazing.
It's pretty much whatever you want.

2661
02:00:22,370 --> 02:00:24,810
They a chicken corn dog hot dogs.
Oh yeah.

2662
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:26,620
I think I went to one in Colorado 
actually.

2663
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:28,930
That was one of the first ones I went 
to.

2664
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,310
Corn beef.
Hot Dog.

2665
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:31,210
That's great.

2666
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:36,640
Unoriginal plot like Carlsbad Sia.
How dare you,

2667
02:00:36,641 --> 02:00:39,070
your Momma while you were doing so well 
before the.

2668
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:42,820
Let's not bring up that full red band.
Doesn't like old music.

2669
02:00:42,870 --> 02:00:44,100
Oh,
I do like music.

2670
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:46,460
You don't know what you're talking about
frank over there.

2671
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:47,620
Shit,
Bro.

2672
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:52,760
I Love Beatles.
Mostly Beatles with my favorite zipline 

2673
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:52,760
is probably my second favorite old 
school.

2674
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:53,320
Old Music.
Yeah.

2675
02:00:53,321 --> 02:00:55,990
To hold out a love is one of my favorite
songs of all time.

2676
02:00:56,230 --> 02:00:58,030
There was something about the seventies 
man,

2677
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:00,550
they had a certain sixties and the 
seventies.

2678
02:01:00,730 --> 02:01:05,730
They had a certain energy to their music
that like what was representing the 

2679
02:01:05,730 --> 02:01:10,411
changes that were going on in the 
culture that we haven't had in a long 

2680
02:01:10,411 --> 02:01:13,681
time.
Like the thing about Jimi Hendrix and 

2681
02:01:13,681 --> 02:01:14,980
the thing about the doors and the 
Beatles and all the zipline,

2682
02:01:14,981 --> 02:01:18,040
the bands from that era is like they 
really were,

2683
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:20,650
they,
they were bursting onto the scene in one

2684
02:01:20,651 --> 02:01:25,651
of the most,
the one of the biggest changes and in 

2685
02:01:25,651 --> 02:01:28,861
our human culture ever,
like between the fifties in the 

2686
02:01:28,861 --> 02:01:32,580
seventies,
shit just went haywire and whacked out 

2687
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:32,740
of fucking control and all of a sudden 
there's,

2688
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:37,920
you know,
love power and stop the war and 

2689
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,321
everyone's doing acid and Ken Keasy and 
the fucking Mary Pranksters and they're 

2690
02:01:40,321 --> 02:01:44,501
all doing acid and hanging out with 
fucking Timothy leary and Hunter 

2691
02:01:44,501 --> 02:01:46,790
Thompson and everyone's trying to change
the world and everybody's fucking.

2692
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:51,790
Everybody left and wide.
And Jimi Hendrix is onstage this jam 

2693
02:01:51,790 --> 02:01:54,770
into his guitar doing the Star spangled 
banner with his fucking guitars,

2694
02:01:54,771 --> 02:01:59,771
the craziest version of it ever.
And his dirty hippies on acid wallowing 

2695
02:01:59,771 --> 02:02:00,470
in the mud in front of them.
I mean,

2696
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:03,740
there was nothing like it.
There was nothing like it before.

2697
02:02:03,741 --> 02:02:05,420
It changed the culture,
you know,

2698
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:07,070
so that music,
when I listened to it,

2699
02:02:07,071 --> 02:02:08,990
man,
I feel that shit in it.

2700
02:02:09,140 --> 02:02:13,100
When I listened to like some old Hendrix
or some stones from that error,

2701
02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:17,810
so like you feel the fucking,
the time you feel that era,

2702
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:23,050
you know,
it's like imprinted in the really great 

2703
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:23,050
art of that era.
Like voodoo child,

2704
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:25,880
you know,
like so many fucking songs.

2705
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:27,710
Mother's little helper,
you know,

2706
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:29,660
so many stones,
songs,

2707
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,530
brown sugar.
Come on man.

2708
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:36,590
Digital underground.
What you just ruined.

2709
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:40,820
I didn't even know what you're talking 
about because they were good to.

2710
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,710
Digital underground was good when they 
first came in.

2711
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:45,200
You know what else was good man?
Um,

2712
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:47,570
who does opp naughty by nature.
Naughty by nature.

2713
02:02:47,590 --> 02:02:51,040
Was young and used to be the shit.
Yeah,

2714
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,760
but naughty by nature.
Yes.

2715
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:57,820
But I,
I liked young Mc a couple of songs but 

2716
02:02:57,820 --> 02:03:00,131
naughty by nature.
What I liked about them was that dude's 

2717
02:03:00,131 --> 02:03:00,740
flow was so original.
Third Base,

2718
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:04,220
you know,
they couldn't fuck with that dude.

2719
02:03:04,230 --> 02:03:07,910
Treach had that,
that rhythmic flow that was like,

2720
02:03:07,911 --> 02:03:12,911
he made all the words Ryan cool.
But he also did it almost like he was 

2721
02:03:12,911 --> 02:03:16,331
singing,
like he was talking shit and singing at 

2722
02:03:16,331 --> 02:03:17,450
the same time and doing it really fast 
to show you that he's good at it,

2723
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:20,660
you know?
I mean he was like way more skilled than

2724
02:03:20,661 --> 02:03:25,661
most of those guys.
Like way more transitions and wait 

2725
02:03:25,661 --> 02:03:26,000
craftier,
you know when you have it with that duty

2726
02:03:26,001 --> 02:03:28,460
to do know that you dealt with LPP.

2727
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:32,390
That was a great fucking song.
That was a great.

2728
02:03:32,620 --> 02:03:34,630
That's a perfect example.
That song I overcame,

2729
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:36,980
I never went and listened to that song 
and now I could probably listen to it.

2730
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:38,750
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

2731
02:03:38,751 --> 02:03:41,270
Like back then after awhile it got to 
the radio and you're like,

2732
02:03:41,271 --> 02:03:43,690
Jesus Christ.
It's like the poker face on it.

2733
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:47,330
That's like enough enough Nwa,
express yourself,

2734
02:03:47,770 --> 02:03:52,770
express full capabilities in the 
correctional facilities because some 

2735
02:03:53,991 --> 02:03:58,540
don't agree with how I do this.
A good straightened meditate like this.

2736
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:04,120
Yeah.
That shit was a revolution in the 

2737
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:04,340
morning just in black and what it was 
freaking me out.

2738
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:06,920
I first got into Nwa,
had heard about Nwa,

2739
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:11,950
like a little late to the game,
and this is back when I was still 

2740
02:04:11,950 --> 02:04:13,670
fighting and I was on the treadmill 
doing my workout and I had a Walkman on.

2741
02:04:13,671 --> 02:04:18,671
It was a walkman back then,
a cassette one and I was listening to 

2742
02:04:18,671 --> 02:04:19,040
it.
I think I've met a bit a CD player.

2743
02:04:19,041 --> 02:04:20,660
I don't know.
It definitely wasn't an MP.

2744
02:04:20,661 --> 02:04:23,150
Three player.
He might've been a CD player,

2745
02:04:23,151 --> 02:04:25,040
I can't recall,
but I remember listening to,

2746
02:04:25,041 --> 02:04:26,960
I think it was a cassette.
I remember listening to it and go,

2747
02:04:26,961 --> 02:04:28,280
God,
these guys are so mean.

2748
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,820
Like they're all like anti white people 
and white bitch and white.

2749
02:04:31,821 --> 02:04:34,760
This what they want to shoot people 
like,

2750
02:04:34,761 --> 02:04:35,600
wow,
this is crazy.

2751
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:38,010
It's a must have the music.
And I started getting into like

2752
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:40,470
ghetto boys and shit.
It's all people want to kill people.

2753
02:04:40,650 --> 02:04:43,350
Ice Tea.
I know there was nothing before that.

2754
02:04:43,351 --> 02:04:43,870
You know,
like the,

2755
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:46,800
the rockstars of like the sixties and 
the seventies.

2756
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:48,420
Nobody ever talked about killing 
anybody.

2757
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:52,470
Then all sudden in the eight,
all these rappers are killing people.

2758
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:56,120
Colors see nightmare walking.
Psychopath talking,

2759
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:59,230
let's get butt naked and fuck tonight.
Yeah,

2760
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:04,480
that was like later stuff,
but the early stuff that he came out 

2761
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:04,480
with.
Yeah.

2762
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:09,160
H U s t l e member.
What's the two live crew?

2763
02:05:09,790 --> 02:05:12,610
I used to listen to like two live crew 
and it's weird.

2764
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:17,620
Like I grew up listening to black people
talk about sex like nasty.

2765
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:23,690
They're freaking were put in to live 
greener jail for being too dirty.

2766
02:05:24,430 --> 02:05:26,570
It was so dirty.
They want to lock them in cages and they

2767
02:05:26,571 --> 02:05:27,550
did it.
You know?

2768
02:05:27,580 --> 02:05:32,580
That's how crazy Florida is in Florida.
You can get oxycontin's everywhere you 

2769
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:34,160
turn.
You can go to a store,

2770
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:39,280
you know right next to a fucking 
apartment building and they go to pain 

2771
02:05:39,291 --> 02:05:41,780
management center and you go these pain 
management center.

2772
02:05:41,781 --> 02:05:46,781
There's always oxycotton junkies who's 
sitting around wanting to get their 

2773
02:05:46,781 --> 02:05:46,781
shit.
That's okay,

2774
02:05:46,781 --> 02:05:50,250
but you can't have a black guy talking 
about get his dick sucked,

2775
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:53,540
you know what is that?

2776
02:05:55,110 --> 02:06:00,110
We're terrified of that.
Stopped doing it because I want to read 

2777
02:06:00,110 --> 02:06:00,110
the Stream.
Faggot.

2778
02:06:01,450 --> 02:06:04,050
Why do you keep fucking on trying to 
read what people have to say?

2779
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:09,440
Public enemy minus flavor,
flave don't hate on flavor flavor just 

2780
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:12,030
because you got paid tornado flavor 
because he figured out a way to turn his

2781
02:06:12,031 --> 02:06:14,700
eccentricities into a show.
Kool g rap,

2782
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:17,040
Kool g rap and Dj Polo.
Fuck yeah.

2783
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:22,670
The Beatles or the stones?
Depends on the mood or what do you 

2784
02:06:22,670 --> 02:06:22,670
think?
Beatles or stones.

2785
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:28,750
Beatles million really well.
The beaters were definitely the stones 

2786
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:29,960
too much.
You know who I really liked?

2787
02:06:29,961 --> 02:06:34,961
Man,
that I don't think got enough credit 

2788
02:06:34,961 --> 02:06:34,961
with soundgarden.
I think soundgarden,

2789
02:06:34,961 --> 02:06:35,130
soundgarden,
soundgarden.

2790
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:38,480
Just blow up the outside world.
I'm sorry man.

2791
02:06:38,481 --> 02:06:40,760
That's one of the greatest.
Tap on that dog.

2792
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:46,350
Temple of the dog was great,
but blow up the outside world that just 

2793
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:46,350
that song alone.
That's one of the greatest songs ever.

2794
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:51,341
Man.
They had some really creative fucking 

2795
02:06:51,341 --> 02:06:53,801
songs and Chris Cornell,
his voice just worked so well with that 

2796
02:06:53,801 --> 02:06:57,851
band.
You know this other shit that he's been 

2797
02:06:57,851 --> 02:06:57,851
doing.
I'm not really into it.

2798
02:06:57,851 --> 02:06:57,851
Yeah.
I can't get into it at all,

2799
02:06:57,851 --> 02:06:59,900
but God damn.
He was awesome with soundgarden.

2800
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:03,070
You know his new shit that he did like 
the the pop shit like,

2801
02:07:03,530 --> 02:07:06,750
oh,
maybe I give the guy a chance once.

2802
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:08,930
Fuck around.
People don't know.

2803
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,550
Sometimes you take chances.
You don't want to fuck you.

2804
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:13,910
Doing that new gorilla is awful.
Is it?

2805
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:16,040
God?
They were so good.

2806
02:07:16,090 --> 02:07:18,350
They knew it's because it has like this 
guy screaming,

2807
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:21,900
bluesy,
jazzy type stuff in it.

2808
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:23,600
I don't know.
It's pretty good.

2809
02:07:23,810 --> 02:07:26,960
The first time I made out with a chick I
listen to the comfortably numb like pink

2810
02:07:26,961 --> 02:07:30,440
floyd.
I was watching wwf,

2811
02:07:30,441 --> 02:07:33,740
number two,
the basement of my friend's house.

2812
02:07:33,770 --> 02:07:36,220
The first time I read steps,
wf number two,

2813
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:38,260
whatever used to be called.
Which one was that?

2814
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:43,770
I don't remember,
but it was on the TV and it was first 

2815
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:43,770
time I ran wrestling,
wrestling.

2816
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:48,570
Wwe.
You were progressing while progressing 

2817
02:07:48,570 --> 02:07:48,570
was on.
Wow.

2818
02:07:48,570 --> 02:07:50,520
Did she make like a little muffled?
I don't remember.

2819
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:53,710
I don't remember when you get too loud 
so nobody could hear some weird.

2820
02:07:53,711 --> 02:07:58,711
I don't remember now because it was like
after homecoming and my friend was 

2821
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:03,160
upstairs having sex on the family were 
just jamming it so nobody was home.

2822
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:05,020
Exactly.
So then you put on a show.

2823
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:06,940
You're trying to try to make your 
friends here.

2824
02:08:06,941 --> 02:08:09,310
How loud you right.
I did it.

2825
02:08:09,311 --> 02:08:11,570
I don't think I did macro around shit.
Fuck up.

2826
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:16,580
It's soccer,
but let them know you're doing crazy 

2827
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:16,580
shit down there so they feel 
uncomfortable.

2828
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:16,580
If I didn't,
I don't remember it.

2829
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:17,410
Trying to do that and try to kill your 
friends.

2830
02:08:17,411 --> 02:08:20,410
Boner just by over over freaking.
No.

2831
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:21,570
The room down the hall.
No,

2832
02:08:22,090 --> 02:08:25,850
no.
I'm a quiet sex man.

2833
02:08:26,700 --> 02:08:27,790
You got a gorilla?
Fuck them.

2834
02:08:27,791 --> 02:08:32,791
Every now and then dude.
You probably Purim and everything while 

2835
02:08:32,791 --> 02:08:32,791
you're having sex.
I'm quiet man.

2836
02:08:32,791 --> 02:08:34,240
Style.
I drove into a pillow,

2837
02:08:34,241 --> 02:08:36,310
a lot of rape jokes,
a lot,

2838
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:40,210
a lot of positional dominance.
I'm very good at guard passing.

2839
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:45,480
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
Guard passing shit.

2840
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:52,880
It's funny how you know you can date one
girl and think that like it's cool to 

2841
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:54,430
choke girls because that's what they 
want.

2842
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:57,040
Jumping and jumping and like what?
They don't like that at all.

2843
02:08:57,041 --> 02:09:02,041
I don't like that.
That's confusing that you don't want 

2844
02:09:02,041 --> 02:09:02,041
that.
That was sacked.

2845
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:03,580
Yeah.
Or He loves that.

2846
02:09:03,610 --> 02:09:08,610
He likes smacking girls too,
but as long so I can see them in real 

2847
02:09:08,610 --> 02:09:08,820
life now.
Like slapping him when he's bone them.

2848
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:11,920
I don't,
I don't want to connect those two things

2849
02:09:11,921 --> 02:09:13,360
together.
Violence and sex.

2850
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:16,480
I don't because I think you can connect 
things in your head.

2851
02:09:16,481 --> 02:09:19,330
You can set up a little pathways and 
like it or not,

2852
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,370
they're in there.
You know?

2853
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:22,270
I think sometimes dudes get obsessed 
with feet.

2854
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,830
You don't know what the fuck was that 
all about,

2855
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:27,880
but it's a thing and dudes get horny and
excited about feet.

2856
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:33,120
Well,
that same shit can happen with slapping 

2857
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:33,120
people.
Dunkin likes to be spanked and you could

2858
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:36,330
date a girl and she likes you to slap 
her and then you get into that and you,

2859
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:41,510
you guys have logo sex because you're 
slapping and fucking in the ass and 

2860
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:42,040
she's nutty and then you know,
that's your shit now.

2861
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:44,770
Like you're all fired up and the next 
year you try to slap her and fuck her in

2862
02:09:44,771 --> 02:09:48,450
the ass and she's like,
you fucking piece of shit and you ruined

2863
02:09:48,451 --> 02:09:50,620
like the best relationship ever.
Why?

2864
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:55,740
Because you're addicted to ask fucking 
and slap and bitches and that's just 

2865
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:56,440
wrong man.
I need to get your shit together.

2866
02:09:56,441 --> 02:09:58,380
It's funny how different every girl is 
to.

2867
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,340
Some of us want to be fucking.
Other guys are like,

2868
02:10:00,370 --> 02:10:02,070
why are you doing it so rough?
You know,

2869
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:03,810
some girls,
they want you to look at their clit like

2870
02:10:03,811 --> 02:10:04,250
this.
All right?

2871
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:09,840
They want you to go like this.
And the other girls who want you to 

2872
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:12,120
fucking shake your head.
Like,

2873
02:10:12,210 --> 02:10:17,210
I want you to punch it.
They want to get crazy with it.

2874
02:10:17,850 --> 02:10:20,320
Then asshole,
they want to go nutty.

2875
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:21,640
You know,
some girls want,

2876
02:10:21,650 --> 02:10:23,710
didn't want the whole thing,
didn't want fingers.

2877
02:10:23,890 --> 02:10:25,570
They want you to fuck their face.
They want money.

2878
02:10:25,571 --> 02:10:27,310
Shit.
But if you try that with other girls,

2879
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:31,390
you got problems son.
That's why I just let them take control.

2880
02:10:32,110 --> 02:10:34,010
Sometimes you got to take a chance.
Sometimes you got to roll

2881
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:39,010
the dice,
but you got to know how how freaky girl 

2882
02:10:39,010 --> 02:10:41,111
is at.
Some girls would have never done it 

2883
02:10:41,111 --> 02:10:43,331
before,
but you just tried it and then all of a 

2884
02:10:43,331 --> 02:10:43,890
sudden you parties on.
I would recommend as men have experience

2885
02:10:43,891 --> 02:10:48,891
in it in his elder years.
Don't get all excited about that ass 

2886
02:10:48,891 --> 02:10:49,160
fucking.
That shit is not sanitary.

2887
02:10:49,190 --> 02:10:51,240
It's not good for anybody.
It's only.

2888
02:10:51,310 --> 02:10:52,550
It's only.
It doesn't feel better.

2889
02:10:52,551 --> 02:10:54,590
It's just because it's taboo.
That's Nettie.

2890
02:10:55,070 --> 02:10:58,300
That's the trick and it's unsanitary and
you could ruin your wife's butthole.

2891
02:10:58,570 --> 02:11:00,170
Right?
You'll break that shit.

2892
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:05,200
They're all going to have problems 
shitting with like 20 years when they 

2893
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:07,100
get old dudes who are gay,
a lot of gay dudes just go with the blow

2894
02:11:07,101 --> 02:11:09,170
job,
a blow job jerking each other off.

2895
02:11:09,171 --> 02:11:10,310
They give up.
Yeah.

2896
02:11:10,430 --> 02:11:11,550
A lot of gay dudes.
They're like,

2897
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:14,840
you don't target your asshole pounded 
some big Dick.

2898
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:17,690
Lexington steel type character.
Ripping your asshole part.

2899
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:19,760
You know,
and there's a lot of that online.

2900
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:22,890
We were talking about that,
about how easy it is to see porn online.

2901
02:11:22,891 --> 02:11:24,520
Like ass fuck porn.
Pam.

2902
02:11:24,521 --> 02:11:26,930
Like within a couple clicks,
you know,

2903
02:11:26,990 --> 02:11:29,060
I'm all you have to do is just put it in
your google,

2904
02:11:29,061 --> 02:11:34,061
go to a site and it's free.
You just pay a lot of money for like 

2905
02:11:34,061 --> 02:11:37,510
little shitty ass tiny videos that you 
can download online or in magazines or 

2906
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:39,740
sears catalogs,
but mean the porn.

2907
02:11:39,741 --> 02:11:42,050
Just the evolution of porn over the last
few years.

2908
02:11:42,051 --> 02:11:45,340
I mean now you've got like these youporn
science and you know,

2909
02:11:45,450 --> 02:11:50,450
pornhub meet your giant big pictures.
I mean it's a giant big image and it's 

2910
02:11:50,481 --> 02:11:55,481
high quality and it's free.
Like how the fuck are they able to do 

2911
02:11:55,481 --> 02:11:55,481
that?
Who's,

2912
02:11:55,481 --> 02:11:56,870
how is everybody getting paid?
Like how's that work?

2913
02:11:57,080 --> 02:12:00,350
And if that's happening,
who the fuck is buying porn these days?

2914
02:12:00,351 --> 02:12:01,090
There's any.
I mean what,

2915
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:06,120
how down to their sales,
if anybody needs a bailout horn and 

2916
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:06,730
period is down,
there's no reason for pointing.

2917
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:11,990
People have moved on.
Were people in with webcams are now 

2918
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:11,990
giving it for free on their facebook 
page.

2919
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:15,080
I've always said about porn.
Why would you need to make more porns?

2920
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:20,170
They have.
There's like billions of points you 

2921
02:12:20,170 --> 02:12:20,170
couldn't possibly have jerked off to all
of them.

2922
02:12:20,170 --> 02:12:20,870
It's not even possible.
There's so many,

2923
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:26,230
unless you're so goddamn specific,
you know the like you follow one girl 

2924
02:12:26,230 --> 02:12:27,380
and you know,
it's a fantasy adventure.

2925
02:12:27,381 --> 02:12:29,000
Porn,
it's all acted out as long.

2926
02:12:29,001 --> 02:12:31,190
Only three fuck scenes in the whole hour
and a half movie,

2927
02:12:31,191 --> 02:12:33,800
but there's a lot of bad acting.
There's dudes who are into those,

2928
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:39,060
you know,
they follow like one particular porn 

2929
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:41,030
starting to get into it and get obsessed
by her and go to meet her at the Avn 

2930
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:41,030
awards and sign autographs with them.

2931
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:43,280
You know,
some dudes just lock onto one chip,

2932
02:12:43,281 --> 02:12:48,281
but if it's just,
you're just looking to jerk off to 

2933
02:12:48,281 --> 02:12:49,961
stuff.
You don't have to ever make new porns 

2934
02:12:49,961 --> 02:12:49,961
there's plenty of points.
Nobody's seen them all.

2935
02:12:49,961 --> 02:12:51,950
It's impossible.
How many points are there?

2936
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:53,240
Do you know?
Twitter verse.

2937
02:12:53,930 --> 02:12:55,880
Anybody have any idea?
Yeah,

2938
02:12:55,881 --> 02:13:00,881
it's a lot of these porn stars that 
moved onto just paying per like live 

2939
02:13:00,881 --> 02:13:01,340
like this kind of web streaming.
Like,

2940
02:13:01,341 --> 02:13:03,250
you rent them for an hour and you tell 
them,

2941
02:13:03,330 --> 02:13:03,890
you're like,
all right,

2942
02:13:03,891 --> 02:13:06,290
I want you to put this into your 
butthole and that's a good move.

2943
02:13:06,450 --> 02:13:08,600
She probably do the one on how much I 
can get something.

2944
02:13:08,610 --> 02:13:11,300
My buddle.

02:13:28,010 --> 02:13:31,040
They did a porno up and he's a real cool
dude.

2954
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:31,420
He's just

02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,260

he's just porn actor who,

2956

2957
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,000
He's got this grant,
I don't know his blog title 

2958
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,000
unfortunately,

I'm going to find it for you because 

2961
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:47,060
he's really write some crazy shit,
but he's a really cool dude and he does 

2962
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:48,750

in Hollywood.

2963
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:50,580
Yeah.
He's a really tough guy too.

2964
02:13:50,610 --> 02:13:53,040
He boxed.
He had a boxing match and Mario Lopez,

2965
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:57,050
but Mario made them things on them.
Mario gave him a bed,

2966
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,250
not a beating,
but he beat him.

2967
02:13:59,370 --> 02:14:00,890
I shouldn't say that.
Let me follow up.

2968
02:14:00,940 --> 02:14:03,750
Tyler Lopez fight a lot.
Uh,

2969
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:06,660
I think he has fought a bunch of times.
He's a tough dude,

2970
02:14:06,661 --> 02:14:08,940
man.
He likes to box and he's really athletic

2971
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:14,350

2976
02:14:26,381 --> 02:14:28,390
Don't be gay.

2978
02:14:36,110 --> 02:14:37,290
Hold on.
Start again.

2979
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:41,350
It's really interesting stories because 
he's a porn star,

2980
02:14:41,351 --> 02:14:43,160
but he's a really intelligent dude and 
uh,

2981
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:45,640
a good writer and a really fucking cool 
guy.

2982
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:47,520
I'd go really nice.
Guy.

2983
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:50,350
Board is not accepting new people to 
register.

2984
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:53,140
It's not that somebody just tweeted.
No,

2985
02:14:53,141 --> 02:14:54,580
it is.
I'll accept people.

2986
02:14:54,850 --> 02:14:59,850
You just got to give me a day or two.
I do it myself because I don't want 

2987
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:00,650
anybody getting crazy.

2988
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:04,460
I don't want to keep track of this whole
thing.

2989
02:15:04,461 --> 02:15:08,720
I'm going to follow him.
Follow night.

2990
02:15:09,860 --> 02:15:10,160
My,

2991
02:15:11,860 --> 02:15:14,240
my large penis friends.
I haven't seen his car.

2992
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:15,490
All right here go.
So hold on

2993
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:29,250
when steam,
how dare you.

2994
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:33,930
We're just getting started soon,
right?

2995
02:15:34,050 --> 02:15:35,400
That's it.
That's our next thing.

2996
02:15:35,950 --> 02:15:37,770
We're going to just a few more questions
and then we're gonna get it.

2997
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:39,630
I haven't been doing it for two hours 
man.

2998
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:41,580
So we've been doing it for two hours.
No,

2999
02:15:41,581 --> 02:15:43,560
I'm just saying I'm just ran out of 
steam.

3000
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:46,200
Watch such great heights.
What are you talking about,

3001
02:15:46,201 --> 02:15:46,590
son?
Oh,

3002
02:15:46,591 --> 02:15:47,760
the video,
the porno video.

3003
02:15:47,970 --> 02:15:49,020
Um,
I'm sure you can,

3004
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:51,630
you porn or something?
Those fucking things are everywhere.

3005
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:53,820
What I want to know about these things,
about these,

3006
02:15:53,821 --> 02:15:56,910
um,
you porns is how they make money and how

3007
02:15:56,911 --> 02:16:01,911
to make money now.
I mean are a lot of people that are 

3008
02:16:01,911 --> 02:16:01,911
doing that.
A lot of people that are there,

3009
02:16:01,911 --> 02:16:04,320
they still like filming things and 
paying for them.

3010
02:16:06,290 --> 02:16:11,290
Yeah,
I think right now it's things like the 

3011
02:16:11,290 --> 02:16:13,811
cosby show type porn stuff where it has 
to be like a gag gift on those types of 

3012
02:16:13,811 --> 02:16:15,020
wonder man because they're still filming
a lot of them.

3013
02:16:15,021 --> 02:16:17,630
Derek always working.
I wonder where.

3014
02:16:17,631 --> 02:16:22,631
I mean maybe I'm websites are eventually
going to start sponsoring their own 

3015
02:16:22,631 --> 02:16:22,631
porn,
you know?

3016
02:16:22,631 --> 02:16:25,100
Well that's what I was saying.
Most porn stars have gone to doing their

3017
02:16:25,101 --> 02:16:30,101
own web cam type thing.
But what I meant was websites getting 

3018
02:16:30,101 --> 02:16:31,920
exclusive content deals with porn stars 
of film in their own porns,

3019
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:37,290
you know,
and like people get to ride in 

3020
02:16:37,290 --> 02:16:37,290
suggestions,
you know,

3021
02:16:37,290 --> 02:16:37,660
hey,
I want to watch Jessie James Suck.

3022
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:42,840
Lexington steals deck on a boat when a 
Japanese Samurai outfit and then okay,

3023
02:16:43,661 --> 02:16:46,960
we're gonna film that they filmed it and
put it online and pay for it.

3024
02:16:47,050 --> 02:16:48,770
There's no reason to pay for it,
but you wouldn't pay for it.

3025
02:16:48,780 --> 02:16:50,350
But if you felt like you were creating 
it,

3026
02:16:50,610 --> 02:16:55,610
you know,
maybe it's like one of those builders 

3027
02:16:55,610 --> 02:16:57,350
shoe websites.
We could put your own purple stripe on 

3028
02:16:57,350 --> 02:16:57,350
your.
If you go to use dream at night,

3029
02:16:57,350 --> 02:17:02,161
you can find the same shit for free man.
There's a whole website devoted ab 

3030
02:17:02,161 --> 02:17:02,260
dishes.
The future.

3031
02:17:02,261 --> 02:17:07,261
How about this?
Maybe the future is people will fuck 

3032
02:17:07,261 --> 02:17:07,261
live in front of you.
You can tell them what to do.

3033
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:10,530
Yeah,
but they already do that though.

3034
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:11,860
Know what I mean?
Like hot checks.

3035
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:13,260
Oh yeah.
I mean there's pretty good high.

3036
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:16,830
There's a lot of websites that do sit in
front of the TV,

3037
02:17:17,090 --> 02:17:19,420
sit in front of the laptop and then you 
go and suck his cock.

3038
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:22,330
It happens all the time and it happens 
every day.

3039
02:17:22,331 --> 02:17:23,770
Yeah.
That's been happening for a long time.

3040
02:17:23,771 --> 02:17:27,630
There used to be thing whatever that are
dirty pervert I'll talk.

3041
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:32,640
Is that it's all piled talk is it's 
people having sex going like there's 

3042
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:36,300
people that like people to watch them 
have sex and people are just sitting 

3043
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:36,300
there like,
Oh,

3044
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:37,980
do it in your book,
and then they do that.

3045
02:17:37,990 --> 02:17:38,890
Yeah.
That's been happening since like,

3046
02:17:38,891 --> 02:17:40,720
Hey,
well I'll talk.

3047
02:17:40,721 --> 02:17:42,630
That's the problem with having.
It's not even on pal talk.

3048
02:17:42,631 --> 02:17:44,760
I don't think anymore to cut it out.
It's on everything now.

3049
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:46,660
It's on ustream.
It's on Justin TV.

3050
02:17:46,661 --> 02:17:49,600
It's not.
There's actually links.

3051
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:52,300
There's somebody posted a couple of 
weeks ago to watch people from.

3052
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:57,370
What is it about about [inaudible] 
that's so private?

3053
02:17:57,730 --> 02:17:58,600
You know,
it's funny.

3054
02:17:58,601 --> 02:18:01,300
It's like we want to do it so badly.
Everybody lives for it.

3055
02:18:01,301 --> 02:18:02,860
We all acknowledge that we all live for 
it,

3056
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:05,050
but if anybody catches you doing it,
anybody catches you.

3057
02:18:05,051 --> 02:18:10,051
Engaging in that sort of pleasure.
It's so intimate and revealing about 

3058
02:18:10,051 --> 02:18:14,071
you.
It's like we're so terrified of 

3059
02:18:14,071 --> 02:18:15,661
revealing things about ourselves and 
that's the big one is people seeing you 

3060
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:15,661
fuck people seeing,
you know,

3061
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:18,260
you suck someone's pussy.
People seeing fuck,

3062
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:20,210
some girl never sucked a dick.
All crazy.

3063
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:21,550
That's craziness.
You know,

3064
02:18:21,551 --> 02:18:23,200
there's something about that that 
people,

3065
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:25,750
people associate that with like almost 
like madness.

3066
02:18:25,751 --> 02:18:27,730
You know,
like the people that are willing to like

3067
02:18:27,790 --> 02:18:30,040
watch standing there while people watch 
them fuck.

3068
02:18:30,041 --> 02:18:31,120
Like wow,
they're crazy.

3069
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:32,890
Too crazy.
Like they can just take it,

3070
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:37,900
just do it.
Perform in front everybody like dudes 

3071
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:37,900
get creeped out by it.

3072
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:41,260
If a guy,
if you're at a party and everybody's 

3073
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:42,901
having a good time,

He couldn't be nervous,

3076
02:18:45,941 --> 02:18:47,740
right?
Why is that?

3077
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:49,970
If because if,
if he had only anonymous Nag,

3078
02:18:50,060 --> 02:18:50,840
it's like,
Ugh,

3079
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:55,950
that was killing me and his girlfriend 
was like massaging them while you guys 

3080
02:18:55,950 --> 02:18:55,950
were all talking.
That will be cool.

3081
02:18:55,950 --> 02:18:55,950
Like,
oh,

3082
02:18:55,950 --> 02:18:57,700
we're having a nice conversation.
Everything's cool.

3083
02:18:57,790 --> 02:18:59,710
She just making him feel better,
but if she's like,

3084
02:18:59,730 --> 02:19:01,120
oh,
I'm going to suck my dick real quick.

3085
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,380
Well,
how come everybody can't go?

3086
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:04,380
Okay.
He's getting uploaded.

3087
02:19:04,430 --> 02:19:05,380
I right there in front of us.
Whoa,

3088
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:05,840
Whoa,
Whoa,

3089
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:06,670
whoa.
No.

3090
02:19:06,671 --> 02:19:10,210
Everybody gets like really freaked out 
because it feels too good.

3091
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:13,030
It's like the background feels good but 
sucking your Dick.

3092
02:19:13,031 --> 02:19:18,031
It's just too crazy.
Just kind of sticking them out for 

3093
02:19:18,031 --> 02:19:18,550
everybody.
You know some about that.

3094
02:19:18,790 --> 02:19:20,080
Right?
It's weird.

3095
02:19:20,710 --> 02:19:21,820
Closer.
Weird too.

3096
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:24,820
It's almost like clothes and covering.
You're covering,

3097
02:19:24,821 --> 02:19:28,070
you're pushing.
It's like just somehow or another

3098
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:33,250
we've intellectualize that not only do 
we have to survive and all these 

3099
02:19:33,250 --> 02:19:33,840
different climates and we have to,
you know,

3100
02:19:33,860 --> 02:19:36,560
make sure that we have some stuff to 
cover us and keep us warm,

3101
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:40,580
but we also got to slow the fuck down.
Make it tougher to fuck.

3102
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:43,580
It can't just be like right there,
it can't just be dicks hanging out,

3103
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:45,500
pussy taken out because we're just gonna
fuck.

3104
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:46,880
You could just going to make too many 
people.

3105
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,060
Even in hot weather.
It's totally unacceptable to walk around

3106
02:19:50,061 --> 02:19:52,980
naked everywhere and just start fucking 
people at the supermarket that.

3107
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,760
But that's what would happen if 
everybody was naked.

3108
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:58,040
If you lived in Florida when it's 110 
degrees,

3109
02:19:58,041 --> 02:19:59,540
you don't have to wear fucking clothes.
Okay?

3110
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:01,260
And if there was no laws against wearing
clothes,

3111
02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:02,480
people just started walking around 
naked.

3112
02:20:02,690 --> 02:20:07,690
People would fuck everywhere.
They'd be fucking in bushes and trees 

3113
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:08,810
that fuck in the car.
There'd be checks sucking guys.

3114
02:20:08,811 --> 02:20:10,700
Dicks while they were driving.
Everywhere you looked,

3115
02:20:10,701 --> 02:20:12,470
it would be going on.
It will be everywhere.

3116
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:17,700
You'll be way more crashes from getting 
your Dick sucked dry and then it would 

3117
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:17,700
be from twittering or from texting

3118
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:22,450
or it might be the exact opposite and 
you're seeing people's floppy tate's 

3119
02:20:22,450 --> 02:20:22,450
everywhere.
You're like,

3120
02:20:22,450 --> 02:20:22,940
oh look,
these floppy tits everywhere.

3121
02:20:22,941 --> 02:20:25,850
I can't see this floppy tip for about a 
day,

3122
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:27,410
and then you're gonna want to get your 
dick sucked.

3123
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,340
Right?
Trust me,

3124
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:29,670
trust me.
Alright,

3125
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:33,410
you're gonna.
You're gonna fucking starbucks.

3126
02:20:33,411 --> 02:20:34,580
And I'm like,
Oh God,

3127
02:20:34,581 --> 02:20:36,200
everyone's shits everywhere.
Yeah,

3128
02:20:36,201 --> 02:20:41,201
maybe you can handle it.
Maybe it's because the dude right next 

3129
02:20:41,201 --> 02:20:43,200
to a giant snake dick or no fucking this
white bowman's math.

3130
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:43,760
Well,
you're trying to.

3131
02:20:43,761 --> 02:20:48,761
Julia Latte can take one 80 year old 
lady tits to ruin my whole day to say 

3132
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:57,370
that,
but if Jessica beals naked fingering 

3133
02:20:57,370 --> 02:20:57,370
herself right next to that 80 year old 
lady,

3134
02:20:57,370 --> 02:20:58,670
you'll snap out of it and they forget 
about that old lady.

3135
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:02,360
Jennifer has a hairy ass.
Hello?

3136
02:21:02,361 --> 02:21:05,330
And it's a razor and I got some free 
time.

3137
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:07,710
I don't care if she's got to hear about 
it all getting there.

3138
02:21:07,740 --> 02:21:09,330
Oh No,
I'll clean it all up.

3139
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:12,930
I'll Polish it down a buffet.
I put cream on it.

3140
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:16,560
Whatever she wants,
whatever.

3141
02:21:16,570 --> 02:21:17,910
I got a shaver.
That's it.

3142
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:21,810
That's kind of a weird thing that all 
women agree.

3143
02:21:21,811 --> 02:21:24,960
That hair is gross.
It's like this is what we look like.

3144
02:21:24,961 --> 02:21:25,740
God Damn it.
Okay.

3145
02:21:25,741 --> 02:21:26,670
We grow hair.
We go.

3146
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:31,690
I mean,
some women like this kind of shit that 

3147
02:21:31,690 --> 02:21:31,690
like men to have hair or might have 
inherit chest or hairy legs,

3148
02:21:31,690 --> 02:21:34,360
but they all agree that women with 
Harris grows and there was no,

3149
02:21:34,361 --> 02:21:37,320
no one like it was like all psyched up 
about girls being Harry,

3150
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:39,060
something like that Shit.
Hairy feet,

3151
02:21:39,070 --> 02:21:40,610
fiery legs and shit.
Really?

3152
02:21:41,050 --> 02:21:42,980
Supposedly hippy dudes.
Really?

3153
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:44,560
You think so?
Fuck yeah man.

3154
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:45,560
Wow.

3155
02:21:45,690 --> 02:21:46,080
Well,
okay.

3156
02:21:46,081 --> 02:21:47,010
Maybe,
but you.

3157
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:52,100
Almost universally.
I mean there's gotta be a few 

3158
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:54,081
exceptions,
but almost universally we've accepted 

3159
02:21:54,081 --> 02:21:54,081
the fact that girls hair is not sexy,
right?

3160
02:21:54,081 --> 02:21:54,920
I don't think so.
Fucking hair.

3161
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:59,930
It's disgusting.
Especially when they have it like on 

3162
02:21:59,930 --> 02:21:59,930
their back and just that amazing though,
but

3163
02:21:59,930 --> 02:22:03,400
it's amazing that we make girls take 
stuff off their body that grows 

3164
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:06,821
naturally to perpetrate some new,
some new sleeker model that's coming in 

3165
02:22:06,821 --> 02:22:07,160
the future.
That's less monkey.

3166
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:12,520
You know?
That's clearly what we're trying to do 

3167
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:15,010
when you're in a shave pussies and 
shaved legs and even when dudes shave 

3168
02:22:15,010 --> 02:22:16,670
themselves down and get all oiled up and
try to look all sexy,

3169
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:21,850
what you're trying to do is you're 
trying to get as far away from the 

3170
02:22:21,850 --> 02:22:23,270
monkey as possible.
You're becoming some sleek,

3171
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:26,460
you know,
almost like silver surfer looking thing.

3172
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:27,700
You know where you're,
you're,

3173
02:22:27,710 --> 02:22:30,450
you're evolving.
You know you're a form,

3174
02:22:30,570 --> 02:22:35,570
you know your round and smooth and 
you're not Harry and fucking primitive 

3175
02:22:35,660 --> 02:22:37,710
and ape like,
you know,

3176
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:39,120
like whatever.
We're trying to do weird.

3177
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:43,350
Like that's like about evolution.
We're trying to get rid of as much money

3178
02:22:43,351 --> 02:22:44,970
as possible before we fuck you.

3179
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:48,360
We don't want no crazy bitches.
Gonna go nutty and ate the babies.

3180
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:53,540
We're try.
We're going to want this bitch to get 

3181
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:53,540
rid of all the hair.
Get rid of everything.

3182
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:54,390
What's this shit with bleach that he 
believes that?

3183
02:22:54,391 --> 02:22:54,990
No,
this is wax,

3184
02:22:54,991 --> 02:22:56,030
that shit.
Wax It,

3185
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:57,600
watch it.
But if I'm going to keep boxing,

3186
02:22:57,601 --> 02:22:58,590
I just want to shave it.
We're gonna.

3187
02:22:58,620 --> 02:22:59,820
Get rid of it.
We're going to give you hormones.

3188
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:01,940
Can't remember that you got to get rid 
of all this.

3189
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:03,810
Why is this down here?
Why you have you right there?

3190
02:23:03,811 --> 02:23:05,410
Can you ask that?
Can you ask that we.

3191
02:23:05,440 --> 02:23:10,440
Whatever we want to do,
we want to make you as less monkey as 

3192
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:10,440
possible.
That's weird man.

3193
02:23:10,830 --> 02:23:15,830
You know,
I mean when you see like a big hairy 

3194
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:15,830
dude.
Do you remember George the Animal Steele

3195
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:17,070
from wrestling?
George the animal steele was fucking bad

3196
02:23:17,071 --> 02:23:20,550
ass pro wrestler and one of the things 
about him was he was so hairy.

3197
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:23,400
I mean it was incredible.
He was like an animal.

3198
02:23:23,401 --> 02:23:28,401
He really was like a monkey.
I mean he was just this thick fucking 

3199
02:23:28,401 --> 02:23:31,440
bald dude who had just hair everywhere.
His back,

3200
02:23:31,441 --> 02:23:36,441
his arm.
He had been in a bunch of movies too 

3201
02:23:36,441 --> 02:23:36,441
because he's such a character.
Such a unique look and God.

3202
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:39,270
But man,
if there's anybody that ever looked more

3203
02:23:39,271 --> 02:23:40,590
like an ape,
me.

3204
02:23:40,591 --> 02:23:43,590
So Harry,
like that's why his nickname work.

3205
02:23:43,740 --> 02:23:46,200
I mean if it was the same guy,
but you shaved all that hair off,

3206
02:23:46,201 --> 02:23:48,000
you couldn't call him George the animal 
steele.

3207
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:50,740
That wouldn't be nearly as good.
The part was cool.

3208
02:23:50,741 --> 02:23:55,741
It was that he's a fucking gorilla man.
It was crazy to see three girls and a 

3209
02:23:58,131 --> 02:24:03,131
cup made you gang.
This is one of those guys with fucks up 

3210
02:24:03,131 --> 02:24:03,131
everything.
Yeah.

3211
02:24:03,131 --> 02:24:03,131
No,
you know,

3212
02:24:03,131 --> 02:24:04,400
those guys will tell you a story.
He said,

3213
02:24:04,401 --> 02:24:06,220
fucking guy,
three coats,

3214
02:24:07,810 --> 02:24:12,810
Tracy Morgan guy.
You know there was three girls.

3215
02:24:14,241 --> 02:24:15,590
One Cup.
I don't need to see that.

3216
02:24:15,591 --> 02:24:16,670
I saw two girls.
One Cup.

3217
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:19,100
That was bad enough.
My.

3218
02:24:19,150 --> 02:24:21,840
I'm surprisingly soft when it comes to 
shock [inaudible] stuff.

3219
02:24:22,030 --> 02:24:22,870
How dare you,
Eddie,

3220
02:24:22,871 --> 02:24:25,090
strike.
How dare you question my manhood.

3221
02:24:25,390 --> 02:24:25,930
Yeah,
no,

3222
02:24:25,931 --> 02:24:26,710
you're right.
I,

3223
02:24:26,711 --> 02:24:31,711
you know what I think too much.
So when I see something really fucked 

3224
02:24:31,711 --> 02:24:31,711
up,
I don't just go,

3225
02:24:31,711 --> 02:24:32,950
ah,
faggots dead.

3226
02:24:33,370 --> 02:24:37,510
I think of all the different shit that 
led up to it and how it happened and who

3227
02:24:37,511 --> 02:24:42,170
did it and what the fuck is going on.
Hook Dane Cook is having us alive.

3228
02:24:42,250 --> 02:24:45,550
Exclusive comedy show or order.
You have to pay for it.

3229
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:48,300
Wow.
That's what they're doing now.

3230
02:24:48,630 --> 02:24:53,630
People are doing live shows and you pay 
for some people when you know when 

3231
02:24:53,630 --> 02:24:56,931
you're selling out selling out theaters,
there's a reason he's not selling out 

3232
02:24:57,541 --> 02:25:02,541
theaters.
She's telling out arena arena and 

3233
02:25:02,541 --> 02:25:02,541
there's a reason for that.
You got a different beast.

3234
02:25:02,541 --> 02:25:05,850
You got people that are just 14 and 
ready to go.

3235
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:09,420
Maybe it's the ejaculation at the end.
No one wants to get hit.

3236
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:14,450
I don't know.
I was talking about like that was too 

3237
02:25:14,450 --> 02:25:16,461
long ago.
Sometimes people post something about 

3238
02:25:16,461 --> 02:25:16,461
what we were talking about five minutes 
ago.

3239
02:25:16,461 --> 02:25:17,760
We don't remember what the fuck we were 
talking about five minutes ago.

3240
02:25:18,450 --> 02:25:20,760
Mr Hans is horrific.
Yes,

3241
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,620
it is horrific.
If you haven't seen it,

3242
02:25:22,621 --> 02:25:26,470
you must watch it.
What are my thoughts on breast implants?

3243
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:28,230
Is it a ridiculous concept,
vic?

3244
02:25:28,350 --> 02:25:29,260
Norcal?
Yeah,

3245
02:25:29,290 --> 02:25:30,850
it is right.
Breast,

3246
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:31,900
breast implants.

3247
02:25:32,190 --> 02:25:37,190
One of the weirdest things about human 
beings that it makes a girl more 

3248
02:25:37,190 --> 02:25:39,961
attractive.
Maybe stick some things under her chest 

3249
02:25:39,961 --> 02:25:42,750
and parts of her body and pressed 
forward in our larger finger nipples.

3250
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:44,200
Anything like that.
I love it.

3251
02:25:44,380 --> 02:25:46,000
Who Do like like,
um,

3252
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:50,320
silver dollar ones are big point.
You want big silver dollar area,

3253
02:25:50,790 --> 02:25:53,050
those are great,
but like big tits,

3254
02:25:54,030 --> 02:25:59,030
big tits.
You know what's strange is how many 

3255
02:25:59,030 --> 02:26:00,070
people are getting jobs these days 
apparently took a real issue by job,

3256
02:26:01,810 --> 02:26:03,100
by job or anything that's real.
No,

3257
02:26:03,140 --> 02:26:04,570
it's real apparently.
That's awesome.

3258
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:10,090
She's always had that.
It's not like there's any pictures of 

3259
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:10,090
her back in the day,
you know,

3260
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:11,700
she's just got those freak genetics.
But there was um,

3261
02:26:12,270 --> 02:26:15,460
um,
a buddy of mine and he was joking around

3262
02:26:15,461 --> 02:26:17,020
with this.
He's been dating this girl for like four

3263
02:26:17,021 --> 02:26:18,040
months.
He's joking around.

3264
02:26:18,041 --> 02:26:18,340
What'd you get?

3265
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:20,470
A job like joking around about her ass 
being nice.

3266
02:26:20,860 --> 02:26:22,480
And she goes,
actually I did.

3267
02:26:22,660 --> 02:26:23,560
And he's like,
what?

3268
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:28,840
And it turns on like girls are getting 
them left and right to getting butt 

3269
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:28,870
implants to make their butt stick out 
more.

3270
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:33,400
How about you just go to the gym?
You fucking lazy bitches.

3271
02:26:33,401 --> 02:26:36,130
Okay.
You crazy lazy bitches.

3272
02:26:36,670 --> 02:26:40,570
Put some weights on your back and do 
some fucking squats.

3273
02:26:40,630 --> 02:26:44,240
Okay?
What is your whole 24 hour day failed?

3274
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:46,330
You can't do some of this.
Yes you can.

3275
02:26:46,331 --> 02:26:51,331
You Lazy Bitch.
Don't go to a fucking doctor's office 

3276
02:26:51,331 --> 02:26:51,800
having to cut a hole in your snatch and 
stuff.

3277
02:26:51,801 --> 02:26:54,490
Some fucking airbags up there.
That's ridiculous.

3278
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:57,340
Okay.
You need to go to the fucking gym.

3279
02:26:57,341 --> 02:26:59,980
If you want to grow an ass,
go to the fucking gym.

3280
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:02,350
Jesus,
right?

3281
02:27:02,710 --> 02:27:03,580
Am I right?
Brian?

3282
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:08,660
Now know you like fake,
but I think there's nothing wrong with 

3283
02:27:08,660 --> 02:27:08,660
the difference between fake boobs and 
fake,

3284
02:27:08,660 --> 02:27:09,880
but I think you're crazy.

3285
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:12,340
You're not getting the real genetics.
Let me tell you something.

3286
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:14,860
It's like fake steak.
Okay?

3287
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:18,640
Girls who have like a real juicy ass or 
that real.

3288
02:27:18,641 --> 02:27:19,990
The real wide hips,
small waist,

3289
02:27:20,590 --> 02:27:22,600
those girls are freaks.
Okay?

3290
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:24,610
That's what.
That's why guys are attracted to them.

3291
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:26,950
They have so much hormones in their 
body.

3292
02:27:26,951 --> 02:27:29,800
They have so much going on.
Those girls are horny as fuck.

3293
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:32,080
It's nature.
Little wings,

3294
02:27:32,081 --> 02:27:37,081
big ass.
That's why you're attracted to them 

3295
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:37,081
because they're the most capable of 
giving birth.

3296
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:41,610
They have birthing hips and we find 
those attractive and they have enough 

3297
02:27:41,610 --> 02:27:42,970
fat on the ass to ensure that they're 
going to survive during the pregnancy.

3298
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:44,950
We liked that with like a little 
plumpness.

3299
02:27:45,190 --> 02:27:49,480
It's attractive to us and those that 
feels better.

3300
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:51,040
Trust me,
those girls are freaks.

3301
02:27:51,140 --> 02:27:52,390
Butter.
But yeah,

3302
02:27:52,391 --> 02:27:54,580
that's a real ass though.
That's her real ass.

3303
02:27:55,490 --> 02:27:57,410
It is,
dude.

3304
02:27:57,420 --> 02:28:01,270
It's a real ass.
It's been confirmed scientists and uh,

3305
02:28:01,290 --> 02:28:06,290
the fucking mythbusters got involved.
They know it's a real ass fake tits.

3306
02:28:07,061 --> 02:28:08,080
Look ridiculous.
He's like,

3307
02:28:08,110 --> 02:28:10,150
Yo will not go tell anybody.
It's fake.

3308
02:28:10,151 --> 02:28:15,151
Tits do ridiculous.
But they still do look good sometimes 

3309
02:28:15,151 --> 02:28:15,151
too,
man.

3310
02:28:15,151 --> 02:28:15,151
You know,
I'm not gonna lie.

3311
02:28:15,151 --> 02:28:19,441
I know as a human being,
I know it's completely ludicrous that I 

3312
02:28:19,441 --> 02:28:22,741
find a girl more attractive because 
she's got these bags and her skin and 

3313
02:28:22,741 --> 02:28:22,741
make her tits

3314
02:28:22,741 --> 02:28:23,420
hanging out more.
But it's still,

3315
02:28:23,421 --> 02:28:25,970
you do,
you're more attracted to the frame.

3316
02:28:25,971 --> 02:28:29,090
It's like there's something going on in 
our bodies.

3317
02:28:29,091 --> 02:28:34,091
There's,
there's a frequency that we try to hit 

3318
02:28:34,091 --> 02:28:35,960
physically that men try to hit and women
try to hit to make themselves attractive

3319
02:28:35,961 --> 02:28:39,170
to the opposite sex and whatever.
Whatever the fuck it is.

3320
02:28:39,300 --> 02:28:39,790
We,
we,

3321
02:28:39,850 --> 02:28:42,140
we try to,
we try to be in and we try to nail it.

3322
02:28:42,150 --> 02:28:47,150
It's being a certain weight and being 
healthy and smelling good and it's also 

3323
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:51,911
being a certain shape.
There's like women want a certain shape 

3324
02:28:51,911 --> 02:28:53,210
to men as guys who get like peck 
implants because they can't grow,

3325
02:28:53,230 --> 02:28:55,880
they don't grow muscle very well I 
guess,

3326
02:28:55,881 --> 02:28:57,840
and they try to do a lot of bench 
precedent.

3327
02:28:57,880 --> 02:29:02,880
They get lazy and so they just stick 
these plastic things in their chest and 

3328
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:02,880
make their,
their,

3329
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:07,210
their own boobs grow out and they have 
things for their arms to and for the 

3330
02:29:07,210 --> 02:29:08,420
calves to make their bodies look bigger.
I mean,

3331
02:29:08,421 --> 02:29:10,340
it's all craziness.
It's all,

3332
02:29:10,420 --> 02:29:12,230
but it's all desire to be loved,
you know?

3333
02:29:12,231 --> 02:29:14,360
It all comes from some weird thing we 
want to be.

3334
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:17,390
We want to be the desirable shape that 
everybody's looking for.

3335
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,920
Very strange,
you know?

3336
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:23,860
Alright,
what else we got here?

3337
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:26,820
The painting behind me.
What is it?

3338
02:29:26,970 --> 02:29:28,620
It's not a painting.
It's a photograph.

3339
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:32,340
It says an American girl in Italy in 
1951,

3340
02:29:32,580 --> 02:29:37,580
and it's by this lady Ruth Orkin,
and she took a picture of this poor girl

3341
02:29:39,090 --> 02:29:44,090
walking down the street and American 
girl and she's in Italy where my 

3342
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:46,320
ancestors are from all fucking savages 
and they're all grabbing their dicks.

3343
02:29:46,321 --> 02:29:47,450
Look at this,
this picture,

3344
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:50,670
mad magazine.
This guy's grabbing his dick is and he's

3345
02:29:50,671 --> 02:29:54,300
making them that face and these guys are
all laughing.

3346
02:29:54,301 --> 02:29:57,600
There's an old guy and he's going to 
fucking cigarette out here like this and

3347
02:29:57,601 --> 02:30:02,601
this guy's got his pants up through his 
rib cage and they're all staring 

3348
02:30:02,601 --> 02:30:05,250
mercilessly at this one chick.
And she walks through this fucking snake

3349
02:30:05,251 --> 02:30:10,251
pit of men.
This gauntlet of Shitty dudes just 

3350
02:30:10,251 --> 02:30:10,260
hanging out in the street looking for 
trouble,

3351
02:30:10,261 --> 02:30:12,570
looking at stick the Dick and somebody 
there.

3352
02:30:12,570 --> 02:30:14,430
Those people are savages.
Living Room.

3353
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:17,460
They got loafers with no socks.
Nineteen 51.

3354
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:20,330
And you know when people talk to you 
about the good old days and you know,

3355
02:30:20,470 --> 02:30:25,470
you watch TV and see father knows best 
and you think that's what people really 

3356
02:30:25,470 --> 02:30:25,980
liked.
Now that's what the people on tv,

3357
02:30:25,981 --> 02:30:28,050
we really like.
This shit was still going on.

3358
02:30:28,290 --> 02:30:30,120
Human beings don't get,
don't get tricked.

3359
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:32,550
We're not crazy.
We've always been crazy.

3360
02:30:32,551 --> 02:30:34,260
It's not like this generation's fucked 
up.

3361
02:30:34,290 --> 02:30:37,320
Every generation's fucked up.
So that's why I liked that picture.

3362
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:39,090
And on that note,
ladies and gentlemen,

3363
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:41,220
I think that should be it.
Right.

3364
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:47,040
Anything else?
What about stick?

3365
02:30:47,041 --> 02:30:48,870
Cam was a no go.
What do you stick?

3366
02:30:48,871 --> 02:30:50,610
Cam Junkie fellow.
Was that your favorite site?

3367
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:54,140
I don't know if I'm,
I don't know.

3368
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:59,160
Stiff Cam will be better,
but ustream shoots you pretty good 

3369
02:30:59,160 --> 02:30:59,220
except right now it's frozen now.
I just paused it.

3370
02:30:59,290 --> 02:30:59,870
Oh,
okay.

3371
02:31:01,150 --> 02:31:03,540
Our upload is not as good as our 
downstream.

3372
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:07,070
That's way more sinister than I 
expected.

3373
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:08,170
What is sinister?

3374
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:13,600
Alright.
Um,

3375
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:18,800
the Taliban is putting explosives and 
women's suicide bombers.

3376
02:31:18,801 --> 02:31:20,880
This guy just said.
Yeah,

3377
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:23,370
I did hear about that.
That's pretty nutty.

3378
02:31:23,790 --> 02:31:25,400
Yeah.
Um,

3379
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:30,940
I don't know how they,
I don't know how they talk those chicks 

3380
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:33,531
into what I heard.
What they're doing is they're raping 

3381
02:31:33,531 --> 02:31:35,190
women and they're getting these women 
and humiliating them and getting them to

3382
02:31:35,191 --> 02:31:36,390
the point where they,
uh,

3383
02:31:36,570 --> 02:31:38,730
Coco's butt implants.
Oh my goodness.

3384
02:31:39,180 --> 02:31:44,180
This gentleman here just nailed it.
And we're going to find out if you're 

3385
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:44,180
correct,
sir.

3386
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:45,930
If this guy's right,
we've got a fucking scandal in our hands

3387
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:47,700
and this will be another case by the 
way,

3388
02:31:47,701 --> 02:31:50,820
if it is right,
a brian being able to spot the phony.

3389
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:56,060
Brian is awesome at spot in the phony.
Brian spots more fake shit on the 

3390
02:31:57,801 --> 02:31:59,690
Internet than anybody I've ever met in 
my life.

3391
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:02,330
I think that's true.
I think you deserve that designation.

3392
02:32:03,490 --> 02:32:05,570
We get that dirty bitch.
Oh,

3393
02:32:05,571 --> 02:32:07,580
that's her.
Oh my God.

3394
02:32:07,581 --> 02:32:08,920
It's a fake ass.
Fuck you.

3395
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:13,960
Oh my God.
It makes you think that was real way to 

3396
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:14,210
measure what makes you think that's 
real.

3397
02:32:14,211 --> 02:32:17,480
Really.
Oh my God.

3398
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:20,880
Oh my God.
It's so real.

3399
02:32:21,150 --> 02:32:22,200
Oh Jesus.

3400
02:32:23,690 --> 02:32:25,280
Coco before.
But implants.

3401
02:32:25,790 --> 02:32:27,260
God,
she ruined a perfect.

3402
02:32:27,261 --> 02:32:32,000
Asked to look at her ass and it looks 
pretty fucking high now.

3403
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:33,520
Hell yeah.
It's cartoon asked.

3404
02:32:33,570 --> 02:32:35,730
It's like Pamela Anderson back in the 
day.

3405
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:39,800
Now that I find out there's some bags of
shit in there.

3406
02:32:40,130 --> 02:32:41,450
No,
I'm not into it.

3407
02:32:41,690 --> 02:32:44,180
I liked the old hotel.
It was a beautiful ass.

3408
02:32:44,780 --> 02:32:46,630
Did you put it online?
Did you retweet that?

3409
02:32:46,631 --> 02:32:49,970
The gentleman.
Did you tweet that to me,

3410
02:32:49,971 --> 02:32:51,410
buddy?
I'll retweet that shit.

3411
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:54,990
That's pretty,

3412
02:32:56,200 --> 02:33:01,200
pretty powerful.
So it looks like Coco has a God damn 

3413
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:01,200
button implant plant.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3414
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:06,110
what the fuck man?
What the fuck is there anything sacred 

3415
02:33:06,110 --> 02:33:09,490
in this world anymore?
So do twitter that to me man.

3416
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:14,520
My friend told her that to Joe Rogan.
Got Net and I'll retweet it at Coco's 

3417
02:33:15,221 --> 02:33:17,620
butt implants then otherwise if you 
could post it,

3418
02:33:17,950 --> 02:33:20,040
post that link post that way.

3419
02:33:21,340 --> 02:33:22,100
Okay.
What is it?

3420
02:33:22,240 --> 02:33:23,480
I'll get it.
I'll do it right now.

3421
02:33:30,290 --> 02:33:30,730
Um,

3422
02:33:31,030 --> 02:33:33,610
so that's really what's important.
Moral Ladies and gentlemen,

3423
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:36,640
we went from space to Coco's button 
plants.

3424
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:40,990
That's how we roll here.
And the Joe Rogan podcast.

3425
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:42,790
Uh,
I think that was the end.

3426
02:33:42,791 --> 02:33:47,791
Ladies and gentlemen,
Brian and I are going to go get 

3427
02:33:47,791 --> 02:33:47,791
something to eat.
I'm hungry actually.

3428
02:33:47,791 --> 02:33:49,060
Now I'm going to try to beat the 
traffic.

3429
02:33:49,061 --> 02:33:50,290
The traffic.
All right,

3430
02:33:50,480 --> 02:33:51,550
Patricia,
to Jill Scott,

3431
02:33:51,551 --> 02:33:53,050
you can't leave me.
I don't know who that is.

3432
02:33:53,140 --> 02:33:54,530
I'm happy to.
Happy.

3433
02:33:54,531 --> 02:33:59,531
I don't know to ask.
These gentlemen have been inundated by 

3434
02:33:59,531 --> 02:34:01,540
human beings and information.
I wish you well in your battle to try to

3435
02:34:01,541 --> 02:34:03,040
figure out what the fuck this is all 
about.

3436
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:04,630
Until then,
see you next week.
