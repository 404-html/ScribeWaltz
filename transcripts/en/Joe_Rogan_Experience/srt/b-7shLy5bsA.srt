1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,640
Yeah,
oh,

2
00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:06,030
you dirty bitches with live.
This is a woman playing the background.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,080
It's a band called honey honey and it's 
the song's called the angel of death.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,060
I'm in love with this chase voice.
I heard this like an hour ago.

5
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:20,061
Somebody posted on my message board and 
then I just listened to it and I've 

6
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,230
listened to like 10 times such as such a
pitch.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,410
I'm such a bitch for like a hot girls 
voice,

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,430
a girl with a beautiful voice man.
There's like a weird harmony that it 

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,280
connects to in inside yourselves.
You know?

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,250
I don't think I bet women to understand 
it.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,530
You know?
I don't know.

12
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:42,300
I don't even know.
I don't even think this chick knows what

13
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,740
she's doing.
She knows how to do it though,

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,400
but the,
the impact that it has on the male 

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,640
standing,
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is 

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:52,640
brought to you by the flashlight.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,710
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for the flashlight

18
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:58,980
and into her in the codename Rogan,
you'll get 15 percent off.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,410
Number one sex toy from her.
There's no other way to say that.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,150
I got to come up with a better way,
Brian.

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,120
I got to come up with something creative
that have been there.

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,310
Yeah.
They've been saying they'll help you get

23
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:09,930
you one.
Do you want one?

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,610
I'm missing out on life otherwise.
So if you want one dude,

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,580
I got one for you.
I,

26
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,980
I,
they just sent me a big buck

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,440
and I brought one for studio flashlight 
and it lasted less than 24 hours.

28
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,180
I brought it here and I was just going 
to use it.

29
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,660
Just show it you just in case people ask
about flashlight because everyone always

30
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,370
asks about what,
what's,

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,010
Hey,
what's this?

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,800
And so I had it for less than 24 hours 
and was like,

33
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,810
dude,
please can I have one sea herring?

34
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,660
Uh,
so.

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,580
So see stole your flashlight.
I gave it to him,

36
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,410
gave it to him.
He's fucking right now.

37
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:36,950
Probably.
Yeah,

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,710
I gave him the black

39
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,830
model.
One,

40
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:39,950
two.
Nice.

41
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,780
Well look man,
it works.

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,150
Solid product.
We wouldn't doors it less.

43
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,220
It was good.
It's a funny thing to get behind.

44
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,120
You know,
people,

45
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:50,750
people find it very offensive and 
pathetic and juvenile.

46
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,270
And I'm not sure,
but I like it.

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,840
I liked the fact that people are 
bothered by it and it's so stupid.

48
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,540
It just highlights how fucking 
ridiculous we are.

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,990
Completely ridiculous that we would care
at all about pleasure.

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,270
You know,
that we care at all about like a device.

51
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,990
It's really good at extracting sperm.
That's all it is.

52
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,760
You know,
what's your fucking problem?

53
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:14,000
People were also brought to you by 
[inaudible] Dot Com,

54
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,000
o n n I t,
makers of Alpha brain,

55
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,360
the cognitive enhancement supplement.
I didn't take mine today.

56
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:22,160
I hope I don't sound stupid.
Got Some right here.

57
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:26,390
If you want to hook a brother up,
I would say a Nigga,

58
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,830
but I'm not that confident.

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,370
Beautiful.
Um,

60
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,310
if you go to on it.com,
o n n I,

61
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:35,840
t,
all of this will be explained.

62
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:39,260
What it is is essentially nutrients for 
your mind.

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,470
It's not gonna make you a genius if 
you're a retard,

64
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,740
but it's going to enhance the way your 
brain works,

65
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:50,741
going to give you.
It gives you like a feeling of mental 

66
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:51,180
clarity and energy.
Um,

67
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,760
there's a lot of people that don't 
understand.

68
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:56,090
Nootropics are,
they don't know what new nootropics are.

69
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,080
I suggested you as Google.
It's an Oh,

70
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,090
new tropics,
and it's all about vitamins and 

71
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,800
nutrients that help your brain function 
at a good level.

72
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,360
And um,
you know,

73
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:12,361
there's plenty of studies that had been 
done on this and you should research it 

74
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:12,361
before you buy any of this stuff.
Also,

75
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:16,921
I want to say that if you,
if you see on its products and you want 

76
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:20,761
to try it,
you're not sure if it's gonna work for 

77
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:20,761
you.

78
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:20,761
You don't know,
try it.

79
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,140
The first 30 pills are 100 percent money
back guarantee.

80
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,170
If you don't like it,
we want to make it as easy as possible 

81
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,330
for you so you even have to send the 
stuff back.

82
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,510
If you try it and you don't feel like it
has any effect on you,

83
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,690
then send,
send the pills back or d or excuse me,

84
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,670
don't even send the pills back.
You don't have to do shit.

85
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,730
You just get your money back.
Uh,

86
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,900
used to be with as many as people 
ordered.

87
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,700
But unfortunately a bunch of people 
decided to just buy a bunch of it.

88
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,450
Get all their money back and then sell 
it on Ebay.

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,580
That old story.
It's not even a story.

90
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:53,581
It's a fable.
It's a true story and it's their story 

91
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:53,581
though.
I've sounded it so many times.

92
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,970
That's the problem,
but it is always ultimately true.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a fairytale.
You think so now it's fairy because 

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,130
patrols,
if I've said it too many times,

95
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,830
it's become.
It's become like not real anymore.

96
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:03,490
Yeah,
you're right.

97
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,590
It does.
It changes a little bit every time.

98
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:06,250
Like you know.

99
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,260
Well they did.
They bought a bunch of them.

100
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,180
They bought like nine owners and they 
sold them on Ebay.

101
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,300
That's the story.
That's all I know though.

102
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:13,830
Dude.
I don't know.

103
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,020
Next weekend is going to be Amazon 
marketplace too.

104
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,290
I didn't make this up,
man.

105
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,530
Don't be an asshole trying to do a 
little commercial here.

106
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,970
You're going to help him.
Brian.

107
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,000
We're also a.
We make a shroom tech sport,

108
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,940
which is a quarter step mushrooms,
a supplement.

109
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,870
It's got beat 12 in it too.
It's great for any,

110
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:35,871
any really,
really hard workout people if you're in 

111
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:35,871
the crossfit or anything crazy like 
that.

112
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:40,830
It's a.
it's a great endurance enhancement 

113
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,261
supplement,
really helps you push into points where 

114
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:44,700
you would ordinarily be fatigued.
You know,

115
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,960
I don't.
I wouldn't suggest any of this if you're

116
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:49,240
not someone who works out though.
There's also shroom,

117
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:49,870
tech,
immune,

118
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,930
all this stuff,
if you're fascinated by it,

119
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,110
a far better description than I could 
ever give is on [inaudible] dot com.

120
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,090
That's o n n I,
t and M.

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,400
There's also a,
an enhanced science of Alpha brain where

122
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:08,890
we've updated due to some criticisms 
updated.

123
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,130
We hired a science advisor and updated 
the way everything is described and 

124
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,720
everyone's trying to be as above board 
and cooled this as possible.

125
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,350
So that's what it is.
If you're fascinated by nootropics,

126
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,770
go to [inaudible] dot com.
O n n I t enter in code named Rogan.

127
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,590
You get 10 percent off,
not just the first order either.

128
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:29,260
Now it's as many orders as you want.
We fixed that shit.

129
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,790
Alright.
Powerful.

130
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,370
Daniella boat.
At least in the house.

131
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,910
You're like a 12 year old DJ.
That's like the kind of like sound 

132
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,630
effects.
I would be really interesting.

133
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,820
I was a Dj and I was 12.
Yeah.

134
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,230
Or it sounds like a sports broadcast,
you know,

135
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,070
like this week.

136
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,060
Yeah.

137
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,060
A lot of those sports guys are hard to 
handle.

138
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,890
Intense.
Yeah.

139
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:07,640
With this special breed of guys that 
like shit on athletes,

140
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,530
you know,
there's like some of them that are just 

141
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:13,530
sports broadcasters,
but some of those dudes like they do.

142
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,720
Um,
and then the like he's a bomb.

143
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,290
He's always been a bomb.
He'll never get off the bench and you're

144
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:18,920
like,
whoa.

145
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,930
Like you're talking about like a 
professional athlete.

146
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:23,480
Their son,
you better settle the fuck down man.

147
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:25,040
You're getting a little crazy with your 
insults,

148
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,690
their fat guy in front of a microphone.
How dare you,

149
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,710
you know,
I like that insult shit.

150
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,730
Right?
Daniella Bolelli my friend or shut up.

151
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,060
Exactly.
So brother,

152
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:42,380
you are a scholar of religious history,
right?

153
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,780
I mean you are essentially.
Why not?

154
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,010
Yeah,
I mean that's the best way to describe 

155
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,010
it.
You are actually a professor on it.

156
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,030
Yup.
How do you think that it is that we live

157
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,090
in 2012 and we have this incredible 
depth of religion.

158
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,960
It's still controlling our lives.
How is it possible that something that 

159
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,981
seemed so like it,
it seems so if you were rationally 

160
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:12,380
looking at it,
you would go,

161
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:17,381
okay,
maybe there's some truth behind any of 

162
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:17,381
this.
Maybe,

163
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:20,410
maybe,
maybe there's some truth behind the 

164
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,911
origins of the creation of the universe,
but clearly this shit has been written 

165
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:24,020
by people and we're going to base our 
lives on this.

166
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:29,021
This is fucking bananas.
People when they say base our lives,

167
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,260
most people will say they do,
but then of course when it's convenient,

168
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,330
when it's not,
it's like,

169
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,620
let's conveniently forget a couple of 
passages.

170
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:40,330
Like there's um,
but aren't those the safest ones?

171
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,210
The ones that stick to the code,
those are the most danger.

172
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,520
The ones that want to throw rocks at 
you,

173
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:49,880
like dancing a Christian girl who slept 
around every now and then.

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,650
You know what I mean?
That's like way better.

175
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,410
I've seen someone who completely stick 
to the code.

176
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah.
No,

177
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:00,010
but I mean several of the sinks are 
because they boiled it down to wheat or 

178
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,720
now the type of questions that no one 
has an answer to and sort of fact these,

179
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,610
unless you know,
people always say,

180
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:09,611
oh,
it's good already in decades we go for 

181
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:10,580
science and reason and we need to be 
irrational and don't get me wrong.

182
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:15,581
Give me a reason why he's a great tool,
but if it doesn't give you answers to 

183
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:16,580
things that scare the hell out of 
people,

184
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,940
people are going to want some answers.
Whether they are bullshit dancers or 

185
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:21,940
not,
doesn't matter.

186
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,331
It's like,
give me some answer because otherwise 

187
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:26,810
it's just damn scary.
His religion than a tool to allow people

188
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:30,110
to psychologically adapt to the next 
stage of evolution.

189
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,630
Like,
like something like a placeholder.

190
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Yeah,
I mean I think it's what people need to 

191
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,971
deal with.
The fact that I can't deal with 

192
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:41,891
uncertainty.
Is it possible at all that any of it is 

193
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:45,521
based on reality?
I mean know that so it sounds 

194
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:45,770
ridiculous,
but so does the universe itself,

195
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,140
like the universe itself is pretty 
ridiculous.

196
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:51,440
The Big Bang is pretty ridiculous.
I don't claim to know shit,

197
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:53,330
so who knows what's up there.
I,

198
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,830
I don't believe or disbelieve,
you know,

199
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,040
my

200
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
attitude is there's what I've 
experienced and there's every single 

201
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,040
house.
Yeah.

202
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,440
What I've experienced,
I kind of know.

203
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,140
And every single males who the hell 
knows,

204
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:09,141
you know,
I mean it pissed me off when people 

205
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:11,421
assume that stuff,
that they themselves as an Evan 

206
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:14,540
expedience somewhere that's the ultimate
truth and everybody needs to believe 

207
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:14,540
that.
It's like,

208
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,480
what the hell?
Why?

209
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,480
How nuts would it be if you died and you
really were at a date in the cloud,

210
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,160
how psychedelic would that be if you 
really did have a dude,

211
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,510
St Peter who's like the FBI who's just 
been following your license,

212
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,010
you're a baby and he's like going over 
day,

213
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,770
why'd you do this and why'd you do that?
Like fucking really.

214
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,850
That would really,
that would wearing a mom and she.

215
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Can you imagine,
what does that really stand for 

216
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:43,960
something though?
I mean,

217
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,240
I wonder if that ideal that this ideal 
of,

218
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,480
you know,
having to live like a Karma free life 

219
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,221
and having to like have done only good 
things only be pure and then you get to 

220
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,750
um,
a moment.

221
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,710
I mean,
is that what they're,

222
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,100
are they envisioning a moment of 
ultimate enlightenment?

223
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,180
When you're framing what is the idea of,
you know,

224
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,330
of,
of the heaven,

225
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,510
like where's it coming from?
Is it coming from the need for the next 

226
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:11,510
level?
We're the,

227
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,510
the possibility.
What would be the best possible 

228
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:16,510
scenario?
The best possible scenarios.

229
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,270
All loved ones would be in the clouds 
forever and ever.

230
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,540
But really,
how fucking long would that last before 

231
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,260
you were bored as fuck.
But you imagine if that's heaven,

232
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,980
you're just hanging out in the clouds.
You can't drive anywhere.

233
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:33,390
You can't go to the movies.
Everybody's up together and having,

234
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,970
what the fuck is that?
That's ridiculous.

235
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,670
No flashlights were.
We all have wings now,

236
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,680
so we just fly around up here.
You know,

237
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,690
what do we do after a while?
You get bored.

238
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Where are you getting your food?

239
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,450
You're in the clouds,
you know,

240
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
you eating fucking cloud fish.
What are you doing?

241
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:50,400
Where are you getting your food?
This is ridiculous.

242
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,590
We don't need food anymore.
Oh my God.

243
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,650
What is there to live for?
That would be my question.

244
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,170
Are their flashlights in Africa?
Can you fucking have it?

245
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,920
How about that?
How about that question?

246
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,230
You know,
you fucking heaven.

247
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,650
If there was heaven,
would you be allowed to?

248
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,950
So what if it was just like a smoker?
Replace.

249
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:06,660
The whole thing was just smoke here.
You know,

250
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:08,170
like you're like,
you're not allowed to smoke,

251
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,270
you know,
all the time.

252
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,510
So like you can have full relationships 
and get girls pregnant.

253
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,930
You can still get a driver's license,
but everything's just really smokey.

254
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,310
Yeah,
that sounds.

255
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,440
That makes sense.
But fucking talks because you're in 

256
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,100
heaven.
It's all cloudy clouds.

257
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,510
So it's like real life book Seattle,
like maybe hit Seattle.

258
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,070
Seattle.
Exactly sucked.

259
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,200
I'm definitely going to vegas.
Oh Wow.

260
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,000
Vegas.

261
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,730
Vegas is some sort of purgatory.
No,

262
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:42,680
that's definitely.
Oh,

263
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,210
it's like in their logo.
State motto.

264
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,890
Hi.
I think it is.

265
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,760
Well,
you know what?

266
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:53,990
There's about the

267
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,040
human behavior man,
when you get them in that frying pan 

268
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,860
frying pan.
That is Las Vegas,

269
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,390
you know,
I hate it now.

270
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,510
I just don't even want to go there.
I just went two days ago and Jesus just 

271
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:06,820
that drive there.
I was like,

272
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,770
fuck,
I forgot how bad it is,

273
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,360
but it's fun to.
As it is,

274
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,770
it's the best place to go see fights.
It's like no other place.

275
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,390
Like it's going to the best club,
like a bar one night and then you're 

276
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:20,950
hanging out there for a couple of days.
Yeah,

277
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,080
it's,
it's a weird town.

278
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:25,840
I like Vegas.
There's a lot of things I like about.

279
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,080
There's plenty of cool people in Vegas,
you know?

280
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,390
It's just the reality is when you get 
people and you just let them go free 

281
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,520
like that.
Do you give them 24 hour free rein,

282
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,730
go drink and you just wind up doing 
ridiculous shit.

283
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,820
That's what I need though because you 
see these people that are doing or why 

284
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,060
do we know this sheets and you know that
they are the ones who are at 9:00

285
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,900
AM at tie.
Then I'm like,

286
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,790
this is the current,
Florida's lave is the.

287
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,420
I know it must be a fucking grind and 
try to go back to work after a weekend 

288
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,890
of that,
but people who lived there,

289
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:04,891
man,
they must get an extraordinary view of 

290
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:04,891
humanity.
They have like,

291
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:08,530
they would be like great psychologists.
People live in Vegas.

292
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:10,510
They probably understand a lot about 
people.

293
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,790
You know,
if you work at a casino,

294
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,870
say if feel like some dude,
you could be like a guy who's like a 

295
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,960
real crafty dude who lives in vegas,
could really describe humanity in a very

296
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:24,961
unusual level.
Probably know any of the show and just 

297
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:24,961
see them at their real estate.

298
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Just the idea that you would get people 
and allow them to drink through all 

299
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,780
hours of the night thinking,
drink whenever they want.

300
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,760
Like nobody ever tells you to stop 
drinking.

301
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:37,250
It's so ridiculous that just drinks it,
that you need a drink.

302
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,640
Like why are you can still drink.
This is crazy.

303
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,060
It's just that alone is nuts.
You know,

304
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,280
we're just a note.
No one's used to that shit.

305
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,900
So that's.
So that's a weird thing.

306
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,330
Alcohol removes inhibition and then you 
have.

307
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:53,440
So it's like just that alone is what 
makes Vegas fucking completely insane.

308
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,460
I mean,
you wanted freedom.

309
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,390
Here you go.
You got it.

310
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,020
Let's see how it goes.
That is.

311
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,300
Dan was the first time that I actually 
was anywhere rather than on the street.

312
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:01,900
I was like,
Whoa,

313
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,400
there are actually people living here.
It is.

314
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,850
This weird filter was just an adult.

315
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,570
He's not on there.
So I'd love it though.

316
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:09,520
I love the fact that there's is a place 
like that.

317
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,220
I love the fact that there's a place 
where people can gamble.

318
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,920
I don't even gamble,
but I love that you could just go gamble

319
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,000
at 3:00
in the morning.

320
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,070
I don't do it,
but if I was into it,

321
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,960
I would love the fact that I could just 
do that.

322
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,770
You know?
I just,

323
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,040
I hate the fact that you can't,
you know,

324
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,970
you have to go somewhere for something 
like that.

325
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:30,150
You know that we restrict that sort of 
behavior everywhere else that's big 

326
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:35,401
enough that our lead Gen is one other 
thing that pissed me off the most 

327
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:35,860
because I mean people being religious,
I have nothing against it.

328
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:40,861
If it,
if it helps you being nicer to your 

329
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:40,861
neighbors or whatever.
Good for you.

330
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:45,550
The stamina piece me off to no end is 
when they want to impose their own 

331
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,240
morality on you and so the victim of 
this crime slow,

332
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,450
you know,
no gambling,

333
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:51,920
no show,
no drugs,

334
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,310
no.
But is there a positive message in 

335
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,630
trying to control some vices?
I mean,

336
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,640
is there a.
is there anything that you could say as 

337
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:03,640
far as like social engineering,
like man,

338
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,940
if you wanted to have a really safe 
environment,

339
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:07,160
maybe what'd you make?
Prostitution illegal.

340
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:12,161
Would you make drugs illegal?
Would you try to suppress it or would 

341
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:17,171
you do.
Do you think that the safer thing would 

342
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:19,691
be to just decriminalize it and let 
people figure it out for themselves?

343
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,330
Mediamath regulation.
I'm kind of like the way that the dam or

344
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,830
something.
Yeah,

345
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:29,831
exactly.
Where do you have some safety standards 

346
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:32,510
is good for everybody involved.
You limit the damage that people can do 

347
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,270
to themselves and to others that,
hey,

348
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,750
it's your choice.
Which our life.

349
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,220
Yeah,
that's weird thing,

350
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:37,880
man,
isn't it?

351
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's a weird thing,
but just the idea that you can control 

352
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,820
what other people do,
but only to a certain extent.

353
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,040
Like we don't say that we can control 
porn yet.

354
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,430
Although there was a thing about Newt 
Gingrich and Mitt Romney and Rick 

355
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,470
Santorum,
all of them are going to go after porn.

356
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,540
Was that who it was?
It was that.

357
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,640
It was at least two of those characters 
we're going to go after porn I think was

358
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,040
gingrich and Santorum.
I don't think about.

359
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,150
Not that it makes much difference 
because those guys are,

360
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,130
you know,
different shades of gray.

361
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:12,131
But man,
it's so weird the now anyone on or could

362
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,020
devote for Santorum scare the shit out 
of me.

363
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,020
A lot of people are voting for him.
They love this guy.

364
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,240
What do you think they're connecting to?
I mean,

365
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,160
you as a person who,
I mean,

366
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,930
he's obviously the message,
uh,

367
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:26,260
quite a bit of it is that is religious.

368
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,830
I mean that kind of stuff you'd boys 
down to somebody will give you the image

369
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,600
of what you would want to have.
We are,

370
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,300
we promote all the good guys will,
uh,

371
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,640
be rewarded old.
The bad guys will be pioneers.

372
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,550
We stand for morality,
we squash anything else.

373
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,610
And the thing that makes some of these 
people feel good is we'll squash every 

374
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,191
one else who doesn't agree with living 
life the way we do so we can impose our 

375
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:57,061
happy dog mountain of anyone else 
because that ultimately is the kind of 

376
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:57,390
shit that he stands for.
And it's a,

377
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,990
people like it.
I mean,

378
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:03,991
he's not just 30 Joanie.
If you look even outside of early John 

379
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:03,991
People voted for a color,
you know,

380
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:05,620
it's not,
it wasn't just purely taking power.

381
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:10,621
People like Nazism,
people like the hardcore form of 

382
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:10,621
communism,
people like,

383
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:15,540
they like certainties.
They like somebody with least puts up a 

384
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,910
strong face and is like a stand for all 
of this volume of solid,

385
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,320
clean know that shit.
Then simplify life.

386
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,290
And that's scary to me.
It's really scary.

387
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,430
Yeah.
Big Time because uh,

388
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,350
I mean it's not real.
It's based on a,

389
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,150
it's based on numbers.
Yeah.

390
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:34,300
And he must have a belief.
You must have a belief.

391
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,450
I mean,
there's no way he could be talking this 

392
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,281
much if he doesn't have a belief,
but anybody who believes something that 

393
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:45,490
they can't really prove and believed it 
to a point where they're willing to base

394
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:46,960
their lives on it like that.

395
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,120
And,
and you want

396
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,740
just run the biggest nuclear arsenal in 
the world.

397
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,150
Really?
Look what,

398
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,340
look what you're banking on.
Look,

399
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,370
look what liquid corner you're in.
You're in the corner of fire and 

400
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:01,370
brimstone for real.
Yep.

401
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,110
You're in the corner of gays.
Shouldn't be allowed to get married.

402
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,500
And like,
what?

403
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,610
What are you doing in 2012?
Why do you want to give a fuck about 

404
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:10,610
what gay guys are doing?
Your Weirdo.

405
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,650
What kind of Weirdo gives a fuck about 
what some gay guys are doing?

406
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,180
Like,
oh,

407
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,850
we have to stop that.
Birth control is bad.

408
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,440
Yeah.
Birth control is bad.

409
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,460
Such fucking crazy.
It's like he's.

410
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,420
He's like pulling us back in the 1960 
[inaudible] his birth controls.

411
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,510
Awesome.
Did you can shoot loads in a checks and 

412
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:32,510
I don't get pregnant.
You stupid.

413
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:32,510
Fuck

414
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,050
dummy.
You fucking dummy.

415
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,050
Have you ever tried the female condom on
a girl?

416
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,210
Who was that?
Like a dental dam?

417
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,260
Yeah,
it's like a dental dam,

418
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,750
but like you could just come as much as 
you want into her.

419
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,810
Like it's amazing but you have to change
it because it's like a vagina diaper 

420
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,860
because it gets really full.
So that team that you just gave us the 

421
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,480
bus draw girl.
Nobody was killed my son.

422
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,750
Seriously?
Yeah.

423
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,840
Who's going to be all excited like my 
vagina diaper.

424
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,900
It is.
Guys will still fuck you if you have a 

425
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:08,900
diaper.
We don't care.

426
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,210
We can get over that real quick.
You know,

427
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,740
for a woman that would be a w.
probably a a deal breaker.

428
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,120
You know,
he'd pull off a diaper,

429
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,150
bunch of goobers in a bag.
What if a girl got a diaper on,

430
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,210
had shit all over it and she was really 
hot and you had a bunch of Napkins and 

431
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,620
some hot towels and what?
You'd cleaned her ass and then her fuck.

432
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:25,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

433
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,590
Wouldn't even bother you.
Really hardly be like a little whatever.

434
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,720
Just got to deal with it.
Wipe her ass clean baby with big tits.

435
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,800
But for a girl,
for guy and like Shit's middle.

436
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,640
His Dick and his pubic hair,
she believed that's it.

437
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,510
It's all women know what it nearly as 
much as we do.

438
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,820
I agree.
We'll clean ship.

439
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,200
We will clean your shitty ass

440
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,350
for real.
Right?

441
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:54,010
That's true.
I don't know why we're free.

442
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,240
We're free gear,
right?

443
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,810
Is that in the Bible?
Do you think that the Bible was 

444
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,380
initially created just to try to keep 
people in line?

445
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,260
You think it was created,
like look and these are some stories.

446
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:11,261
This is some lessons that we've learned 
and then it just kinda like got out of 

447
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:12,860
control.
Like I think it goes both ways.

448
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,890
There's some.
Sometimes you use it as a tool to 

449
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,380
control people's behavior if you feel 
that they are to fuck it up,

450
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,290
but also it's an internal thing.
I think he's not just a,

451
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,340
I know this is bullshit about.
I'm going to feed it to them just so I 

452
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,220
keep it a crazy scene line.
I also think that sound,

453
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,200
the people themselves who started some 
of these things feel needy.

454
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,860
They desperately need it to the point 
where they will.

455
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,550
They are going to be the first one to 
stick their own lives on it and that's I

456
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:38,780
guess the Santorum thing.
You know?

457
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:40,520
You want to leave that way.
I mean,

458
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,290
I think our knots,
but whatever.

459
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,320
It's your life.
You should be free to do whatever you 

460
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,320
want when you want to impose it on 
everyone else.

461
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,600
That's when you'll piss me off.
That's when it gets scary.

462
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:49,940
Yeah.

463
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,140
Which is bizarre to me.
Anybody who really absolutely believe 

464
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,570
something that much is bizarre to me.
Yeah.

465
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,960
Like why do you believe in what you.
Where are you seeing this?

466
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,600
You really believe that book Zen.
What's going on?

467
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:01,240
Man?
This said,

468
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:05,070
that's how that seems crazy,
but you're banking it all in one book.

469
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,480
There's a lot of books,
man,

470
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,190
don't let a lot of shit has been 
written,

471
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,050
you know,
and they're really.

472
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,060
The shit that's the weirdest is the 
oldest.

473
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,530
You can't.
That's nonsense.

474
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,040
We need like a new behavior standard 
guide for humans.

475
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:21,690
That's what we need instead of a Bible,
just a behavior standard guide so we can

476
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:26,691
all get through this world like this.
These are the rules that we agree to 

477
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:28,470
instead have bestowed upon us by a 
higher power.

478
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,960
Yeah,
you definitely shouldn't do most of this

479
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,030
shit.
The Bible says.

480
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,230
Tells you not to do.
Don't be killing anybody.

481
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,750
Don't fuck your neighbor's wife.
All that stuff.

482
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,010
That's all good.
Yeah,

483
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:39,160
you really should.
That's.

484
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,220
Those are good,
but we need some more of those and we 

485
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,200
need like a comprehensive guide just 
based on what we all know to be.

486
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:48,060
Right.
We all know,

487
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,840
I think this is the best time ever to do
something like that because even though 

488
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,830
people were complaining that times are 
tough and unemployment is bad,

489
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,800
and it certainly is economies and in 
terrible position,

490
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,710
but still better than any time in human 
history.

491
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,740
Right.
There's really been no better time as 

492
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,460
far as like safety as far as like the 
access to get food and medicine.

493
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,890
This if there's ever a time for us to 
get our shit together.

494
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Like on paper now,
is it like together as like a group of 

495
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,671
humans instead of instead of bound by 
some crazy words that were written first

496
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:25,590
in ancient Hebrew.
First of all,

497
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,450
they were.
They were told as an oral tradition,

498
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:31,010
Philip for thousand years first.
Yet it's not for seven.

499
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,510
Orlando,
Dr Kim.

500
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:38,511
Imagine what the fuck happens to a story
when you tell it for hundreds of years 

501
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:39,990
before somebody figures out how to write
things.

502
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,070
Whoa.
That's nuts.

503
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,860
What do you think about those Dead Sea 
Scrolls?

504
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,940
Do you know much about that?

505
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,140
I mean,
his artist sinks.

506
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,200
There's what are you fish?
Our scriptures of every religion are one

507
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,930
tiny part of what used to be out there,
and then people,

508
00:22:57,931 --> 00:22:59,400
I mean you get to the kids as 
Afghanistan,

509
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,820
literally,
they get to vote on which books are 

510
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:04,820
sacred and come from God and which ones 
are not that mean.

511
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,800
Can you believe that?
It's like somebody's seat around the 

512
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:09,800
table.
What it's like today,

513
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,380
right now we pull out some book and go,
okay,

514
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:12,510
what do you think about it is these gods
are not.

515
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,670
Okay,
next let's talk about this one.

516
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,790
It was really that arbitrary.
I mean I nearly.

517
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,300
That's amazing.
How many books were like left out?

518
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,940
Are those available?
Who knows because a lot of these.

519
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,140
This is the end,
the Bible.

520
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,780
A lot of these was because he wasn't 
like,

521
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,910
oh,
we decide this is God stuff and sold the

522
00:23:35,911 --> 00:23:36,990
other stuff.
Well read it.

523
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:41,991
If you want to noise like we have to 
burn it because it must be the Davao 

524
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:44,731
son,
so it must be terrible and horrible and 

525
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:46,791
we need to squash any possible other 
alternative and soul that's burned them 

526
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:46,791
old.
Wow.

527
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:50,870
And so when something goes pops up that 
shows a different side to it that wasn't

528
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,110
made a part of the official Canon,
that it makes everybody feel like,

529
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,000
what the hell is going on like is so we 
can base our life on this or can we or I

530
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:01,550
mean most people are going to ignore it 
anyway because otherwise he masters with

531
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,820
categories.
But that's a good idea.

532
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,350
What a weird time.
Yeah,

533
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,900
I mean,
thinking about like the concept of 

534
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:13,900
faith,
the stuff that's at the basie self,

535
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:13,900
uh,
Judaism,

536
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,330
Christianity,
Islam,

537
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,560
think about like the story that they 
own,

538
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,260
the revere.
They all think he's a great idea.

539
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:20,670
You know,
God the shows up that say,

540
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,690
but um,
I really think you should kill your 

541
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:25,690
song.
And they,

542
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:25,690
it's like,
well,

543
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,230
I don't want to kill my song,
but you know,

544
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,340
if it's God speaking wedding decades,
sorry,

545
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,100
bye.
Come on,

546
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,540
let's go.
He's about to kill him.

547
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,350
And then God sends an angel.
Say,

548
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,590
no,
no,

549
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:35,030
no,
wait,

550
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,310
just kidding.
Just testing your faith.

551
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,150
You know,
just checking.

552
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:43,151
You pass the test.
You did very well and now you're 

553
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:43,460
rewarded for it.
You know,

554
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,850
last time I check when you hear these 
embodied voices telling you,

555
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:51,851
you should kill people,
least thinning to that is not what 

556
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:52,910
should make you the guy who everybody 
looks up to.

557
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,190
One thing we want a great example of 
faith.

558
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:59,300
You analyzing what a crazy story God 
wants you to kill your baby.

559
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:01,040
Yeah,
what the fuck,

560
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:06,041
and you're gonna kill your baby for God 
and that was the right thing to do and 

561
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,580
God said he was just testing you.
Holy Shit.

562
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,400
That's a sign.
That good job you'll pass.

563
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:15,401
The test is that Old Testament.
The Old Testament is about as wonky as 

564
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:15,401
it gets,
right?

565
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,460
Predictive,
but they said that the Dead Sea scrolls 

566
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:20,460
were even wonkier.
Like you know,

567
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,191
there's,
there's a lot of dead sea scrolls stuff 

568
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:24,250
that hasn't even been included.
That is the oldest written version,

569
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,550
right?
Jazz,

570
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,110
because it's not part of the official 
cannon,

571
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,120
doesn't mean that it's all good stuff.
I think it's not like he's easy to fall 

572
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120
into the pattern of,
oh,

573
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,621
these evil bastards a manipulated the 
seeings put on these horrible things in 

574
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:38,930
the books.

575
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,030
And so every scene that got squashed 
must be good.

576
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,900
No,
not really.

577
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,440
You know,
some of the stuff that got squashed,

578
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,810
it's probably even worse.
Who knows?

579
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,720
So I love the fact that the Dead Sea 
Scrolls,

580
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:50,750
it was always linked to crazy shit.
People were always like,

581
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:55,751
it's always,
you have photos and mushrooms and it's 

582
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:55,751
like every,
every wacky,

583
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:58,190
crazy story is linked to the Dead Sea 
Scrolls,

584
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,100
you know,
even the fact they found them,

585
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,020
you know,
one of the coolest things is,

586
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:08,021
uh,
the science of putting together the 

587
00:26:08,021 --> 00:26:08,060
pieces because a lot of them were in 
leather.

588
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,100
One of the ways they put together the 
pieces,

589
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:15,101
what they did,
genetic testing on them to find out 

590
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:18,521
which ones came from the same animal.
So they knew that it was a piece of 

591
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:20,000
one's skin.
Incredible stuff,

592
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,140
man.
That's amazing.

593
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,200
Amazing stuff.
It was really incredible.

594
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,600
And they're still putting that fucking 
thing together,

595
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,760
you know,
people are still trying to decipher it,

596
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,830
which broadly over the last 2000 years.

597
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,450
And they found that banter over those 
things.

598
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,820
But you know,
500 years ago somebody would have looked

599
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:35,360
at it.
It's like,

600
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,150
hmm,
you know,

601
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,360
maybe I can start a fire with it or 
something.

602
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Yeah.
When you're starving and you have to 

603
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:44,680
cook the book,
it,

604
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:44,680
it,
you cook the book,

605
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,560
you know when you need something to 
light a fire,

606
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,300
you're going to fuck that book.
Light it on fire.

607
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:50,280
We're going to die tonight.
You know,

608
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,850
bicycling.
Yeah.

609
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,930
Fuck yeah.
How much stuff was lost in the burning 

610
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,130
of the library of Alexandria,
south of disordered.

611
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,140
I mean,
you're talking about thousands and 

612
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,140
thousands of volumes.
It's pretty damn scary.

613
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,240
Yeah.
It's amazing to think that human beings 

614
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,411
can be so fucking creative.
And then so destructive when people 

615
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:14,541
don't understand is there was some sort 
of incredibly advanced society that was,

616
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,300
that it created ancient Egypt.

617
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,940
I mean,
to this day it's a.

618
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,010
there's a bunch of puzzles when it comes
to the immense construction,

619
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,430
the,
the fact that how much just actual mass 

620
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,800
was moved the size of some of these,
these,

621
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,000
uh,
old ballistics.

622
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:36,030
I mean,
it really is incredible society and they

623
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:41,031
knew a lot of things and all of it was 
wiped out in a fire.

624
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,300
And I think it was two fires.
I think there was two different times 

625
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:47,300
they were attacked.
Yeah.

626
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:47,590
I'm sort of like a man.
Well,

627
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,570
how much further would we be if we knew 
all that Shit,

628
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,900
you know?
But it's the same kind of stuff that 

629
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,810
happened even in other places because 
when the Spaniards came over out here,

630
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,870
when they conquered the aztecs and the 
Aztecs who are one of the indigenous 

631
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,111
people that had big lied,
but our reason that books and written 

632
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:07,110
language and the whole thing and the 
Spanish approach was like,

633
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:09,650
well there's these look like in the 
volleyball.

634
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,360
No,
while,

635
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,370
in decades.
It's gonna wait,

636
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,120
we can burn it.
Burn it though.

637
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,740
Hey,
that's nice.

638
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:19,360
But so if it wasn't a Bible,
they just burned it bazzy.

639
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,570
I mean,
it's like your guys that are not 

640
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:24,570
curious,
don't see.

641
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,711
It must be devil worshipers and we 
shouldn't burn evidence and you have 

642
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:29,010
ever done because it's all crap.
Did they burn and Maya and stuff?

643
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,230
Yeah,
I mean basically anything that was in 

644
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,270
mines inklings,
anybody you know there's still fine in 

645
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,350
Mayan temples.
That fascinates me,

646
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:42,351
man.
They said that they might be as many as 

647
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:43,350
a thousand unfound temples in South 
America.

648
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,480
That's crazy.
But then again,

649
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:50,481
when you hike through the jungle that 
there are some tiny or you can see how 

650
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:51,390
that could be because you can't unsee 
it.

651
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,860
You know what?
Going to be 10 feet away and sold them a

652
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:55,830
theme that you have no idea where they 
are.

653
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,470
Fucking incredible culture.
It existed here.

654
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:02,280
What a bizarre,
strange culture that made these,

655
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,300
you know,
these,

656
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,340
these cities that were aligned to like 
astronomical,

657
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,280
you know,
points like really amazing,

658
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:14,610
like he could look the way the sun would
come up through some doorways.

659
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:17,610
It was like perfectly built.
It's incredible.

660
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:19,530
It's like the stuff that they had 
figured out how to do.

661
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:21,300
It's like,
how did you do this?

662
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,520
This is amazing.
One of the pyramid,

663
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,910
the bottom of the pyramid,
there's a gigantic store and ahead of as

664
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,060
snake and he's like,
where the hell is the body?

665
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,890
It's like because of that one day of the
year when the standardize,

666
00:29:32,891 --> 00:29:37,891
this eats the shade of the steps in such
a way that it looks like the body's 

667
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:38,550
coming down here.
I mean it's like,

668
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,210
can you imagine like building that whole
thing and then you have like shitty 

669
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,210
weather

670
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,680
that would really suck.
Just the calculations involved.

671
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,750
I mean it is it.
Is it possible that some of them could 

672
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,090
be coincidental?
I guess the snake thing could be.

673
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,210
It's possible,
but there's so many of them.

674
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,330
There's one in the temple of Luxor.
I think it is,

675
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:05,331
where the light comes down this corridor
and illuminates his whole room on one 

676
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:05,790
day of the year.
No,

677
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:10,791
I mean these guys were awesome because 
this incredible with the had figured 

678
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:16,071
out.
They've figured out some amazing shit 

679
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:17,931
them in the mind.
It's like so much stuff was lost in the 

680
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:20,930
past would have been so fascinating to 
really know what it would.

681
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,660
What,
what?

682
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,690
Like how much knowledge really was 
around during the construction of the 

683
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:26,890
pyramids.
I mean,

684
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,500
what did they really know?
How much?

685
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,830
Well,
how much is lost in just the sand and 

686
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,220
erosion and how much is gone and fire.
What the fuck did they really know?

687
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,410
You know,
good.

688
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Ninety nine percent of the human 
population today with modern technology 

689
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:42,540
and tell them.
Build a pro.

690
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,470
Yeah,
of course.

691
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,930
Nobody.
Yeah.

692
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,770
Everybody liked.
Makes it like it's no big deal.

693
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,420
Canada here.
It's crazy.

694
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,470
If you were asked by just a little bit 
anywhere so it gets the top.

695
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:54,930
It's fucked.
It's amazing.

696
00:30:54,931 --> 00:30:59,931
And they used to be covered in smooth 
limestone to east to be shiny and then 

697
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:03,180
there was a gold cap on the top of them.
God Damn.

698
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:05,250
That must've been magnificent.
Theater Islam.

699
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,130
And what happened if people don't know 
you,

700
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,060
look at the pyramids were they're so 
fucked up.

701
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,850
That's because people stole the 
limestone.

702
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:16,110
They chipped it off of those buildings.
Those Gross,

703
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:21,111
disgusting rat people chewed away at 
that beautiful construction,

704
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:27,110
one of the most amazing things a human 
being has ever created and they chewed 

705
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,311
away it just pulling chunks of beautiful
stone off and building their shitty 

706
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:36,180
houses with it.
Fucking crooks,

707
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,450
rat people.
So you're in a good mood today.

708
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,990
What kind of a human being would deface 
the pyramid date?

709
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,360
There were people that did that terrible
human beings.

710
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,680
I mean,
could you imagine,

711
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:48,600
man,
what kind of a person would fucking chew

712
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:51,920
up the Pyramids and steal the stone?
Jesus Christ cookies,

713
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,330
your own limestone bench.
You know?

714
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,180
Can you make a house out of wood?
Right.

715
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,890
Even the three pigs had options.

716
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,660
They knew some shit though.
Huh?

717
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,120
That's a fact.
That's what kind of religions

718
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,060
around in ancient Egypt,
like what did they worship?

719
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:16,090
It was all like hanging around that.
Or you see the transition from tribal 

720
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:19,961
religions that tend to be more mad,
a little flexible because they are not 

721
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:20,480
written down is relatively small 
society.

722
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,600
So there's a lot more flexibility about 
the beliefs.

723
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:25,280
So there are generally mystic 
shamanistic kind of beliefs,

724
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,590
but then when you turned them into a big
society,

725
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:30,140
we like millions of people living in it.
They become,

726
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,450
you still have a lot of these traces of 
that stuff.

727
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,010
It's all about spirits and these and 
that,

728
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,800
but then they become much more hoodie 
juvenile fish.

729
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,090
Ow there's a clergy leaders if it comes 
and there's the and you know.

730
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,150
So it's kind of a more structured type 
of funny museum that in my mind kind of 

731
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,040
pretty much hitting mean whatever his 
mood about only museum to begin with.

732
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,830
You tweeted a Robert e Dot Howard quote 
the other day.

733
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,180
I love that guy.
Oh,

734
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,400
me too.
When I was,

735
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,320
when I was a kid,
I was a huge.

736
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,630
What was the exact tweet?
It was a Conan quote,

737
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,490
unquote.
I forget what the hell it is,

738
00:33:02,491 --> 00:33:04,520
but it's basically cannon going off.
Yeah.

739
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,570
Find it because I'm about to write down 
their lies.

740
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,360
Yeah,
it was um,

741
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,220
cone in,
in uh,

742
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,580
it was one of A.
I forget which book,

743
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,310
but it's a famous quote.
Where the fuck is it?

744
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:19,500
I live,
I burned with life.

745
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,650
I love Islay and damn content

746
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,270
women are like,
that's so gay for a man.

747
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,360
You know the Sumerian culture,
like what a little fucking chrom what a 

748
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,991
hard ass God he was.
People don't know Robert e Dot Howard 

749
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:39,800
was as bad motherfucker who's an 
incredible author who created.

750
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,220
He created a,
what's called a conquer and Conan the 

751
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,210
barbarian.
It was all these crazy fantasy books.

752
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:51,140
They're amazing.
They're fucking really fun to read.

753
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,370
When I was a kid,
man,

754
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:56,480
I became hooked on,
on the Conan novels and he was,

755
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:57,770
uh,
he was uh,

756
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:00,800
a really nutty dude and wound up taking 
his own life.

757
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:02,510
Right.
I don't know if he's throwing out by the

758
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:06,320
legend has it that he would say that I'm
at night.

759
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,400
He would see these as he would have got 
derrick to it,

760
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:13,401
right.
And suddenly he would see the shadow 

761
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:14,810
behind him and he wouldn't turn,
but he cooked out that he was calling on

762
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,180
Kevin and John Tax ready to shop.

763
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,190
You set off on last year,
all told night.

764
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,500
And he would stay there and like sweat 
that right there.

765
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,510
Right in the morning he was gone.
So he could finally sleep because I know

766
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,320
wouldn't be back ready to shop.
He said,

767
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:35,321
oh wow.
That was the coolest fucking character 

768
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:38,120
in any book ever written down.
You know,

769
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:40,600
the people like Conan the barbarian with
Arnold Schwartzenegger.

770
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,140
That was pretty cool and everything like
that.

771
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,510
But really the,
the real.

772
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:49,660
If someone got ever figured out how to 
do the book justice and make it really 

773
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,720
put it together,
right?

774
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,720
Like the last one was Kinda corny.
The dude was pretty bad ass.

775
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,410
He was.
That dude was a good call,

776
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,890
man.
He,

777
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,450
he seemed to me like what Kona and 
should look like now look great.

778
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,910
But the screenwriting was the screen 
writing was bad,

779
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:04,070
but he was good.
His fight scenes were great.

780
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,750
He looked like Conan,
you know,

781
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,050
I think he people were hating because 
he's too fucking good looking.

782
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,080
That's what it is.
The dude is just way too good luck and 

783
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,140
you make students super uncomfortable.
But if you,

784
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,920
if you not a hater.
I met the dude,

785
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:18,380
he was super cool.
And if you're not a hater,

786
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:19,010
you know,
look man,

787
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:24,011
he got lucky.
He's born six foot five fucking perfect 

788
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:24,800
chiseled face.
You just got to deal with that bitch.

789
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,600
You gotta deal with that.
But guess what?

790
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,400
That's what Colin and supposed to look 
like.

791
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,160
That fucking guy is coming at.
They just need to do it right,

792
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:33,230
man.
The fucking writing was all corny.

793
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:37,010
Like the ending was all corny.
What if like Michael Bay did it?

794
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,090
What Dude?
Yeah,

795
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,080
something like that.
Or swords blowing up.

796
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,870
Horses spinning around everybody you 
know who would do it right?

797
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,750
Quintin Tarantino.
It right.

798
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,240
Tina would fucking do it.
Right?

799
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,450
He would dig into that bitch and if you 
can get Quintin Tarantino to direct the 

800
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,060
movie,
God Damn Son.

801
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,810
That would be bad ass.
Show it.

802
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,900
It would be good magic.
Get him to write it to get him to write 

803
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,390
the screenplay and put put together like
one of the,

804
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,390
one of the better books.
It was so many good books too.

805
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:10,450
I gotta give you.
Having Tarantino would be a freaking 

806
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:10,450
dream,
but I like,

807
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,240
I have to say I liked the,
the original Canon.

808
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,280
Yeah.
And I find it interesting that,

809
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:18,590
that he's the same guy will come up with
some of the concepts were UFC,

810
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,570
you know,
our old gracie said,

811
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:25,571
but all over it because he wasn't one of
their students of the students off the 

812
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:29,570
graces and he was the gracies.
They had the art Davey and they were 

813
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,120
immediately as,
as kind of a creative director or into 

814
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,601
the first UFC started coming up with 
some of the ideas that then somebody 

815
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:38,420
else designed for the arc that go on and
all of that.

816
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,580
And I'm like,
I love that guy.

817
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,700
He created Conan the barbarian and was 
at the beginning of USC.

818
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,310
That's incredible.
I didn't even know that.

819
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,340
That's interesting.
You have some UFC trivia that I didn't 

820
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,950
even know that I can go home.
Satisfied now I'm,

821
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,160
my work is done.
Rampage Jackson is mad at me.

822
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,810
Why?
I don't know is an interview.

823
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:58,730
Read it.

824
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,370
I was watching.
I was just call me fake ass.

825
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,290
And he was saying that shit.
Really?

826
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,390
Yeah.
He was saying that all I want them to do

827
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:11,391
is throw low kicks and reasoning.
It doesn't throw low kicks is because 

828
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:12,330
he's fighting a wrestler.
You dumb asses.

829
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,230
Look,
man,

830
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,880
you know,
I don't.

831
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,970
I'd love rampage.
I don't mean to be rude when I assess 

832
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,280
things.
I'm just trying to objectives.

833
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,320
Really try to figure out how this guy 
could be doing better than he's doing.

834
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,930
When I look at a guy like rampage,
I look at a dude with.

835
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,790
He's fucking,
first of all,

836
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,370
one of the most exciting fighters of all
time.

837
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,180
You go back to his fights and pride like
the Ricardo Arona fight or the or the,

838
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,520
the uh,
Kevin randleman knockout.

839
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,570
Remember that?
Random and knockout.

840
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,200
God damn the slam on a roll.
And I meet so many.

841
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,260
He had a great,
great fucking fights in pride.

842
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,500
Know rampage.
I liked him a lot.

843
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,130
I like him as a person.
I enjoyed hanging out with them.

844
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:54,570
I did a thing with him for the UFC once 
it was,

845
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:56,640
um,
there was a show that we did,

846
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:01,790
I think it was called ultimately.
Was it ufc ultimate inside or something 

847
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,700
like that?
Is that the one we're doing now?

848
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,070
I don't even remember the name of it.
It was,

849
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:07,410
it was on spike.
Oh fuck.

850
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:08,810
What was the name of it?
You know,

851
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,350
UFC unleashed is Michael Goldberg's.
What the hell is it called?

852
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,830
Any idea right now?
Alright,

853
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,960
what time at UFC?
Whatever it was.

854
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:20,670
I don't remember what it was.
Um,

855
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,600
we,
uh,

856
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,530
we drove around in his tracks.
He has this giant monster truck with his

857
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:28,170
face on the side of it and shit.
It's fucking awesome.

858
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,790
It's hilarious.
It's all lifted and shit.

859
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,270
And we drove around and uh,
I even trained with them.

860
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:35,350
We went to the gym and trained and we 
filmed everything.

861
00:38:35,351 --> 00:38:36,100
We went and got chicken

862
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,670
together and yeah,
we went to popeyes.

863
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,740
He's cool as fuck.
I like them.

864
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,740
I don't mean anything when I,
what I'm trying to,

865
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,110
like when I'm judging a fight or what 
not,

866
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,190
I'm not judging a fight,
but when I'm,

867
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:53,430
when I'm doing commentary and a fight,
all I'm trying to do is sort of 

868
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,660
objective,
really assess what I think someone could

869
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:00,690
be doing differently to try to get 
themselves out of a spot if they're not 

870
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,990
winning or you know,
I'm just trying to commentate.

871
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:05,530
It's not,
I'm not like critiquing the guy soul,

872
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:08,110
I'm not like breaking down who he is as 
a person.

873
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,530
I liked the guy a lot,
but even ran pitching himself admits 

874
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,050
that he was more exciting back in the 
day when he was in.

875
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,570
I mean,
it doesn't have to be.

876
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,100
He's a great fighter.
You can do whatever the fuck he wants.

877
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,130
One,
when I'm doing what I'm doing.

878
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:25,420
Commentary is just my objective opinion.
That's all it is.

879
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,510
It's not that I don't like the guy.
Why do you think he stopped?

880
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:31,660
Because even prior to pretty much every 
fight he would picked somebody up,

881
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,060
leave them up in the air,
slammed.

882
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,960
I mean it was like he's saying,
do you know he needed every fight?

883
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,030
No facade.
Then never again.

884
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,440
I'm like,
what the hell happened?

885
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,570
I don't know.
I mean he has a lot more tools now.

886
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,980
He's,
you know,

887
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:46,100
it's,
it's hard to tell him.

888
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,790
Also he was finding people in a ring 
more.

889
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,730
I wonder if that's different.
One thing can actually be easier to pick

890
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:55,410
people up in the cage because they are 
age would.

891
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,340
Well He,
you know,

892
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,500
it also you could get fucking after 
doing that for a long time.

893
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:02,920
You could get,
it's possible you could hurt your back,

894
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:06,400
you could have like issues like a lot of
wrestlers of really powerful guys.

895
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,260
I don't know if he does,
I'm just guessing.

896
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,460
But a lot of guys eventually have like 
kinks in their neck and shit.

897
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,530
Tito's had to,
a disc replacement and data wasn't even 

898
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:16,910
lifting people up was just shooting 
straight,

899
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,880
lifted some people up to.
He knocked out Evan Tanner,

900
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,140
that was with a big body slam and when 
he was younger he would hold these guys 

901
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,140
up a lot.
You know,

902
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,710
I think as you get older you get 
smarter.

903
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:28,750
As you get smarter,
you fight more conservatively.

904
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:29,560
Right.
You know,

905
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,180
but I just wish the guy wasn't mad at me
when I tell them to throw leg kicks,

906
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,740
it's just because he has awesome leg 
kicks.

907
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,340
Oh yeah.
Is,

908
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,240
you know,
he's like,

909
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:38,190
you know,
I'm fighting a wrestler.

910
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,220
Dumb ass.
Like I know,

911
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:40,900
I know I'm Dutch.
I'm just saying man,

912
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,690
he landed a few and his leg kicks are 
fucking bad ass.

913
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,090
I would like to see that if I was in his
corner,

914
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:46,540
you know

915
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:52,170
when rampage is mad at you,
is that something that you should be 

916
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,571
worried about?
Like if you're out and you see them 

917
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:54,571
somewhere and you're like,
oh,

918
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:55,230
I would talk to him and I'd take,
we'd be cool instantly.

919
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,500
I'm not a,
I'm not a bad person and he's not a bad 

920
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:00,500
person either.
He's just,

921
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,710
he's just upset and he's sensitive and 
he's also got the toughest fucking job 

922
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,251
on the planet.
There's a lot of pressure and a lot of 

923
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:07,251
stress involved in being a fighter,
you know.

924
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:11,220
And the last thing I want to do is add 
more pressure and add more stress.

925
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,460
All I'm doing is trying to just 
analyzing the fight.

926
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,530
That's all it is.
It's just I have to be objective.

927
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,260
I can't,
I can't protect someone's feelings,

928
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,860
you know,
at the expense of doing what I'm 

929
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,081
supposed to be doing,
which is sort of analyzing what's going 

930
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:27,081
on,
you know?

931
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:28,920
And some people say I'm biased and he 
was standing a bias towards Jujitsu guys

932
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,010
because yeah,
your lego second deck.

933
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,120
That was cute.
That was funny.

934
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:34,010
It

935
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,030
was funny,
it was good.

936
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:36,850
He was animated and Shit.
You know,

937
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,390
he's,
he's a funny guy,

938
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:39,950
man.
I like rampage.

939
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:45,250
But if anything I'm more biased.
I always say towards like really 

940
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,001
aggressive strikers.
Like vendelay Silva is my favorite all 

941
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:49,001
time fighter.
Rarely.

942
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:49,001
Yeah,
I think so.

943
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:51,500
If I had to pick like one guy,
like the vandelay and pride,

944
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:55,640
he because he was so wild man.
Just every vandelay Silva fight,

945
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,370
you know exactly what the fuck you were 
getting into.

946
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,110
It was like a Tyson fight and then that 
same sort of feeling.

947
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:00,770
Right.
You know,

948
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,450
when he was on top,
you know,

949
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,510
when,
when vandelay was just smashed and 

950
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:07,510
dudes,
when he was at his like,

951
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,260
he's very peak.
He was so wild.

952
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,010
Yeah.
It was a wild guy to look.

953
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,210
There was an excitement as a fan,
like holy shit.

954
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,720
You know what I mean with vandelay was 
gonna fight man.

955
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,060
Everybody would get hyped up and still 
to this day,

956
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,750
like that commonly fight proved it.
Still to this day he's got that,

957
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,900
you know.
So my all time favorite style of 

958
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,500
fighting is really not Jujitsu.
I,

959
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,340
you know,
I,

960
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,370
I liked strikers to watch,
I like to,

961
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,280
I still like watching beautiful Jujitsu 
technique.

962
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,430
I absolutely do.
But for the Oh shit moments for the Oh 

963
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,900
shit,
like almost always chaos.

964
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,850
It's almost hit its head kicks and Mirko
Cro.

965
00:42:46,851 --> 00:42:48,980
Cop was like the king of the Oh shit 
moment.

966
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:50,150
Of course,
you know,

967
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,460
his,
his left high kicks and Fan Angela,

968
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:57,461
you know,
those are the guys that I always like 

969
00:42:57,461 --> 00:42:57,740
really enjoy watching maybe the most,
if anything,

970
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,340
I'm biased towards those guys but I 
just,

971
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,720
you know,
I appreciate all of it man.

972
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:07,721
I appreciate wrestling.
I think wrestling is one of the most 

973
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:10,811
important aspects.
I always show that that's the biggest 

974
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:10,811
base of the pyramid,
you know,

975
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:11,870
and I was never really a wrestler.

976
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,940
I wrestled for one year in high school.
You know,

977
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:18,941
it's,
I don't have a bias when I'm looking at 

978
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:20,981
it.
I'm really trying to look at it as 

979
00:43:20,981 --> 00:43:22,310
objectively as possible and it changes 
all the time or what's important.

980
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:27,311
It changes all the time because 
different levels of guys will enter the 

981
00:43:27,311 --> 00:43:28,280
game and that's when things gets weird.
Like gets things get weird,

982
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:33,281
like when you get like a really high 
level striker that all of a sudden 

983
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:34,580
learns how to sprawl and is really good 
at wrestling.

984
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:37,310
Maybe we wrestled a little bit in high 
school and then all sudden boom,

985
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:39,110
he's in the UFC and you got to deal with
this.

986
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:40,130
Like,
you know,

987
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:45,650
you get to like a really high level 
professional Moitai type fighters who 

988
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,290
have really crisp striking.
If one of those guys,

989
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:53,291
one of those really top end guys,
but one of those are Nesto who slept in 

990
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:53,291
his prime.

991
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:57,790
One of those guys stepped into the UFC.
Everything changes in that division and 

992
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:57,950
then everybody has to figure that guy 
out.

993
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:58,960
Now you have to,
you know,

994
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,160
everyone has to either evolve around his
skills,

995
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,380
find a way to,
to be able to stand with him.

996
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,010
I hope he gets beat up in the gym,
you know,

997
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,050
shooting before the man.
It's such a,

998
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,890
it's constantly changing.
What's important,

999
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,920
what's important is constantly changing.
Where are we seeing like a new version 

1000
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:17,920
like,
oh,

1001
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,221
and then what if,
what if one of these guys show site and 

1002
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:21,221
then all of a sudden you got this Jon 
Jones version,

1003
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:23,690
this new thing,
how do you fucking deal with this?

1004
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:26,960
You've got some young kid who's really 
confident,

1005
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,590
very smart and has unbelievable 
strength,

1006
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,010
comes from a background

1007
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,900
and has the longest reach of any fucking
human being on the face of the planet is

1008
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:40,930
blasting you and you can even get close 
to him and he's getting better every 

1009
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:40,930
day.
Every,

1010
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:41,580
every time he blinks he's getting a 
little bit better.

1011
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,840
You know?
It's ridiculous.

1012
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:47,841
And also he's creative because there are
lots of guys today that are awesome 

1013
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:47,841
athletes.
They're great fighters,

1014
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:50,640
but they are kind of boring to watch 
because they do what everybody else does

1015
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,300
and so,
I mean,

1016
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,360
don't get me wrong,
it's like all the respect in the world 

1017
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:56,360
because they are doing something 
amazing,

1018
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,901
but it's not that you'd watch somebody 
like Jen Jones so you would watch 

1019
00:44:59,901 --> 00:45:00,270
Anderson,
CEO of some of these guys.

1020
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,300
There's like,
it's a master at work and you sit back 

1021
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,300
and it's like,
Jesus,

1022
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,300
what is going to do now?
You know,

1023
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,440
he's an artist.
There's a reason why it's called martial

1024
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:07,770
art.

1025
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,100
Martial artists.
That's.

1026
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,660
That is exactly what he's doing.
That's artwork,

1027
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,060
right?
When you watch his shogun fight,

1028
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,390
watch the John Jones shogun fight.
If that's not like a symphony,

1029
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,780
it's like a beautiful work of art.
You know what he did is he.

1030
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:27,050
He destroyed one of the best fighters on
the planet and he made it look easy and 

1031
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,830
it puts it in perspective because you 
know,

1032
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,660
fucking Leonardo didn't have some six,
four do it,

1033
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,440
trying to punch him in the face while he
was painting his masterpiece.

1034
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,770
Absolutely believe if you watch the John
Jones Leo Machida fight that that is a 

1035
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:44,391
work of art.
I absolutely believe that that's 

1036
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:44,490
artwork.
That's fascinating.

1037
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,640
The finish was so beautiful.
Everything about it,

1038
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,500
everything about the fight is 
incredible.

1039
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,810
The fact that the yellow tagged him a 
few times,

1040
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,000
Liotta look great,
but he just,

1041
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,260
he caught Leo.
Oh God,

1042
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:56,190
I'm on the ground of days.

1043
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,000
I'm on the ground and caught him in that
standing gear,

1044
00:45:58,001 --> 00:46:03,001
Tina God damn woo.
But you put it all together like as far 

1045
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:04,470
as like,
it's awesome entertainment impact.

1046
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:06,780
You cannot.
That's a work of art,

1047
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:09,690
man.
Absolutely is a different type of art.

1048
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:15,020
I like watching some time somebody's 
entire career kind of radar than 

1049
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,400
watching a bunch of fights from 
different people.

1050
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,420
Like watch one guy and watch back to 
back finds of their stuff and you see 

1051
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:20,970
the evolution of their style and you 
really see a style.

1052
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:22,500
They're at work and it's,
it's awesome.

1053
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,890
Yeah.
That is a fascinating thing to watch 

1054
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:27,890
guys evolve.
You know,

1055
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,510
I remember Anderson Silva's first couple
of fights when he first started fighting

1056
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:35,511
in pride.
He was primarily a standup guy and he 

1057
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:35,511
had submitted,
when he went to the ground,

1058
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:36,870
like Takahashi,
I think it was,

1059
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:39,480
got him in a mounted triangle and then 
um,

1060
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,080
with wrestling shoes on,
I think he did was hit Takahashi.

1061
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,750
Now somebody,
uh,

1062
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,190
some dude who had a losing record of all
the things,

1063
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:47,990
the same guy.
You.

1064
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,760
No thinking about shown it before,
um,

1065
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,760
before,
uh,

1066
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,960
he's the same guy.
You'll meet Carlos Newton by decision 

1067
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,390
and in one of the Bushido events that 
cause it.

1068
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,990
That's it.
Yeah.

1069
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,190
Okay.
Now that's awesome.

1070
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,880
Yeah,
and so he mounted them and guide them in

1071
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:07,100
a triangle.
And then Rio.

1072
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:11,020
Joanne got him in that flurry flying.
He'll book.

1073
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:16,340
You never seen Anderson Silva lost in 
one of the most spectacular finishes of 

1074
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,700
all time.
It doesn't get any better than that.

1075
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,490
I'd be stewed Rio shown and fluid him 
sideways,

1076
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,880
tied his legs up together in the 
scissors like a movie that's like some 

1077
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,320
shit from a movie that's like some shit 
from a pro wrestling show.

1078
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,010
And then caught him in this

1079
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,410
flying.
He'll hook and Anderson like immediately

1080
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:35,230
tapped in screaming in pain,
you know,

1081
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,480
that's really the best submission I've 
ever seen.

1082
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,940
Crazy.
And there's anything that craziness.

1083
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:44,941
And on top of it I apparently Anderson's
foot was fucked up when it was going 

1084
00:47:44,941 --> 00:47:46,620
into that fight.
It looked like the second he touches him

1085
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,060
and is already tapping and screaming and
going crazy.

1086
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:49,650
Apparently.
Yeah.

1087
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,670
He went into that fight with a fucked up
foot.

1088
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,490
That's why he wasn't.
He wasn't moving so well.

1089
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,540
Yeah.
That's what it looked like.

1090
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,230
So that guy goes from that and then all 
of a sudden he fights in the UFC against

1091
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,400
Chris Leben and now you see this master,
you know,

1092
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,370
you see like,
wow,

1093
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:06,880
like the way he took leaving a part like
this is a master,

1094
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:12,390
you know,
the way he moved when he liked 

1095
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:12,580
everything leaving through,
he's like shocked out of the way,

1096
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,410
encountered Bam,
Bam,

1097
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:14,800
Bam.

1098
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:20,010
These just precise counters and lievens 
charging forward and he's blasting them 

1099
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,760
with kicks and knees and punches and 
you're like,

1100
00:48:21,761 --> 00:48:25,120
God damn is he good?
Holy Shit.

1101
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,960
His fight for as good a fiend.
I mean I do.

1102
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,770
What the hell can you say?
Well,

1103
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,380
you know,
you know,

1104
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,260
one of the interesting thing is that 
forest,

1105
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:37,410
I had an interview with him about that 
and he told me that he had gotten 

1106
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:37,960
knocked out twice in training camp 
before that fighting.

1107
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,320
So right.
Right away he probably shouldn't have 

1108
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,320
even been in it.
Right.

1109
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,450
You know?
Right.

1110
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:48,451
I mean,
if you get knocked down in a training 

1111
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:50,581
camp like two times,
how many concussions are you allowed to 

1112
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:50,800
have like really close back to back,
right?

1113
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:55,801
That already are disclosed to somebody 
touching you the right away and you're 

1114
00:48:55,801 --> 00:48:55,801
like,
well,

1115
00:48:55,801 --> 00:48:59,761
there's been a few fighters that have 
had that happen to them and they both 

1116
00:48:59,761 --> 00:48:59,761
got knocked out exactly the same way.

1117
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,040
One of them was a,
there was a dude who was fighting in the

1118
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,180
UFC for awhile.
Um,

1119
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:11,030
fuck was Marvin Eastman.
Marvin Eastman got knocked out.

1120
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,480
He was a.
He got caught by Travis.

1121
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:17,650
What the fuck's his name?
Luther Travis Luder.

1122
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:18,580
Of course,
Jesus Christ.

1123
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,780
How can I forget that guy's name?
Who's sick?

1124
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:25,890
Jujitsu guy,
but not really known for being like a 

1125
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:26,390
super powerful striker,
real strong guy.

1126
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,850
I can't believe I forgot his name.
Travis.

1127
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:29,620
I'm so sorry.
I love that guy.

1128
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:31,180
Actually,
I just had too much weight.

1129
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:36,181
Do I blame it on the weed?
That's way too much weight and really 

1130
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:40,231
strong.
I've been sitting here stone like a 

1131
00:49:40,231 --> 00:49:40,231
crazy person over here.
Yeah.

1132
00:49:40,231 --> 00:49:41,710
It's not good for your brain.
Stuff's terrible for him.

1133
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,920
Anyway,
Travis Luder caught Marvin eastern with 

1134
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,841
a right hand and just like at the end of
the punch and eastern went down like he 

1135
00:49:48,841 --> 00:49:49,730
got shot,
but he got snipe from a,

1136
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,190
from a fucking tower.

1137
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,640
It was a.
He had gotten knocked out twice in 

1138
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:56,830
training camp as well by a.
He was a knockdown once,

1139
00:49:56,831 --> 00:50:01,831
I think by Tito Ortiz accidentally ran 
into a knee and knocked down another 

1140
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:04,690
time when I take down attempt so you 
know when that's happening,

1141
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:05,180
man,
you,

1142
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:07,150
you know you can get knocked out super 
easy.

1143
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,980
It's big enough.
MMA and religion.

1144
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:13,981
That was one of my favorite moments ever
when a eastern mountain lost a fight to 

1145
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:18,090
vitor belfort,
did that crazy knee and sprite and then 

1146
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:23,431
they added the cameras in the post fight
interview on Belford saying thank you 

1147
00:50:23,431 --> 00:50:25,330
Jesus for giving me the strength to do 
what I do.

1148
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:27,980
And then they pan on.
Marvin eastern phases like you

1149
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,300
sold that is pretty top one looks at a.
I think you said,

1150
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:34,370
if I remember correctly,
you said he looked like a good spot,

1151
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:37,250
Diana,
which has the best line server,

1152
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,280
but it's really,
really unfortunate that I actually saw 

1153
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,520
that it just kept it to myself and you 
see Belfort going out about Jesus giving

1154
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:49,670
him the strength that you see somebody 
had been plead with blood everywhere and

1155
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,810
you're like,
really?

1156
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:54,200
That's what was going on.
But I thought that was pretty funny,

1157
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:59,290
but that'd be a good guy.
But I think a lot of fighters really,

1158
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:05,171
uh,
liked to believe in the Lord and like 

1159
00:51:05,171 --> 00:51:05,171
to,
you know,

1160
00:51:05,171 --> 00:51:05,690
to be on a good path because first of 
all,

1161
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:10,691
I think it helps their fighting.
I think a lot of guys who were 

1162
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:10,691
Christians,
you know,

1163
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:14,141
they have a little bit of extra faith.
They have a little bit of extra 

1164
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:14,600
calmness,
like extra belief in themselves.

1165
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,770
If you truly are a believer,
there is a benefit to that psychological

1166
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,060
as a tool,
right?

1167
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,780
That's why do exist for edits and Dane 
doesn't look like it makes sense,

1168
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:26,690
but that's why it succeeds because he'd 
believers the huge benefit.

1169
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,900
It helps people be disciplined and stay 
on certain paths,

1170
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,040
you know,
helps people,

1171
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:31,580
uh,
you know,

1172
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,550
stay on,
uh,

1173
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:33,740
uh,
if you,

1174
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:35,810
if you really truly believe in a higher 
power,

1175
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:40,811
you know,
it's much more likely that you're going 

1176
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:41,020
to have a,
at least some sort of a code that you're

1177
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,930
living by.
Right?

1178
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,030
Does that make sense?
Totally.

1179
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:50,670
What is it possible to live life like?
It'd be really nice without that mean is

1180
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:54,230
it possible to give Vince people to live
like a,

1181
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,510
like,
you know,

1182
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:01,350
live like a free person,
but also live within principles of 

1183
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:01,940
decency and just abandoned everything 
else.

1184
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,250
I'm very much thing so,
but it takes,

1185
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:09,251
um,
it takes special people because not 

1186
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,010
everybody can handle it because a lot of
people,

1187
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:13,910
unless you keep them in a little cage,
dale go crazy and do all sorts of messed

1188
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:14,450
up stuff.

1189
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,230
It's kind of like the daoist I left out 
is because you see them,

1190
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,150
they are.
The first fatality is like,

1191
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,640
our staff is,
you need to be smart,

1192
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:27,641
you need to be sensible,
you need to have all these tools that 

1193
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:28,730
you don't have.
So go to take confucianism instead,

1194
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:31,250
it's better for you because you won't 
fuck things up too bad.

1195
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,260
They'll give you a simple rules to 
stick,

1196
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:37,280
to limit how much damage you can make.
Confucianism is bad,

1197
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,220
therefore you seriously just go there.
Our stuff,

1198
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,720
it's too,
you know,

1199
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:46,721
they are elitist.
Obviously they are a little bit with 

1200
00:52:46,721 --> 00:52:46,721
this,
but so is life,

1201
00:52:46,721 --> 00:52:47,090
you know,
not everybody's gonna get it.

1202
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,320
That's how it is,
you know,

1203
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:53,650
it takes a hell of a human being to live
with no rules and steel behaving amazing

1204
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:55,370
way,
but that doesn't mean it can be done.

1205
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,950
And uh,
so in that sense I find,

1206
00:52:57,951 --> 00:53:00,250
you know,
all the rules,

1207
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,380
giving her allegiance useful for a 
segment of humanity.

1208
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,850
But then if you want to talk about full 
potential of human beings,

1209
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,990
I feel like no,
you can do better than that.

1210
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,120
People have a real hard time with that 
though.

1211
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:19,121
When you start segmenting human beings 
and saying that some people are more 

1212
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:21,800
worthy or some people are more capable 
or some people are more even evolved.

1213
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:26,830
You know,
I haven't ever last cell so I don't 

1214
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:26,830
care.

1215
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:31,190
But I mean to be,
let me explain it so I don't sound too 

1216
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,900
much like a vassal butts eats,
I believe in being nice to anybody.

1217
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,460
Okay?
I don't care.

1218
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:40,620
Meyer stupid,
whatever you should treat everybody 

1219
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:40,720
giving them opportunity,
you know,

1220
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:42,600
it's like prove to me that you're not a 
moron.

1221
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:47,601
Great.
I'll give you all the opportunities in 

1222
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:47,601
the world.
But at the same time I can be delusional

1223
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:51,830
and expect that everybody's going to be 
amazingly smart and you walk into any 

1224
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:55,100
room and you can throw.
It's like I kind of expect people to 

1225
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:55,980
suck,
but I'll give them all the opportunities

1226
00:53:55,981 --> 00:54:00,981
in the world to prove otherwise.
And I feel like that weighs a healthy 

1227
00:54:00,981 --> 00:54:04,650
balance between being realistic about it
and being without turning into a jerk.

1228
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,480
You know?
Um,

1229
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,930
so you think that if,
if the government came out and said,

1230
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:10,560
hey,
listen,

1231
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,290
we,
uh,

1232
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,340
we did some studies,
it turns out religions,

1233
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,280
totally bullshit.

1234
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,760
And we're going to start from scratch 
because we don't know what the fuck is 

1235
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,331
out there.
What percentage of people do think we 

1236
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:24,420
just go completely batshit crazy and 
riot in the streets?

1237
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:29,460
Would it be any,
would anything change it on isn't not 

1238
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,641
based on evidence anyway,
so it doesn't matter what anybody tells 

1239
00:54:31,641 --> 00:54:31,641
you.
You a lot of people wouldn't be marching

1240
00:54:31,641 --> 00:54:33,150
through the street.
That would be one way where people would

1241
00:54:33,151 --> 00:54:35,660
like really show how much they believe 
in March.

1242
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:36,860
They would start marching through the 
streets.

1243
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:41,610
They would organize it,
would really put out a message,

1244
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,040
but that's one of the coolest things 
about living in us today.

1245
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:48,210
The in general in the Western world,
you'll find a few.

1246
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,970
Not even that long hand.
They're 200 years ago they were,

1247
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
you know,
you'll burn people on the public square 

1248
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,000
kind of thing.
They,

1249
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,000
they disagreed today.

1250
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,590
Even the hardcore fundamentalist,
they got all riled up and they got 

1251
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,110
piece,
but they are not the Taliban,

1252
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,430
you know,
they may think like them,

1253
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:07,431
but they don't act like them,
but we were trying to stop it from 

1254
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:10,641
getting any further than this.
It's anybody that has that much faith in

1255
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,500
what they can't see.
That's,

1256
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,510
that's,
that's a disturbing thing.

1257
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,880
You're willing to die for this.
That's an issue,

1258
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,960
so they're willing to die.
Part of worries me is you're willing to 

1259
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,931
kill whatever you know.
It's your life willing to enforce your 

1260
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:27,260
ideas.
Yeah.

1261
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,340
The one that pissed me off the master of
this things is the euthanasia debate.

1262
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,700
The fact that today in 2012 with the 
technology that we have where you could 

1263
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:40,840
let people die in a good way,
you could black,

1264
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,120
you know somebody say,
look,

1265
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:47,150
when I get to that point,
I want to be able to shoot me an 

1266
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:47,150
injection.

1267
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:50,630
You put me to sleep.
You give me the other one that puts me 

1268
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:50,630
out without being,
yeah,

1269
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:55,400
that's their damn life.
Nobody's saying that you need to die 

1270
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,721
that way.
You want to go in whatever way you want 

1271
00:55:59,721 --> 00:55:59,721
to go,
good for you,

1272
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:00,910
but you really want to tell everybody 
else how they die.

1273
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,360
It's a tricky thing,
man,

1274
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:08,361
because I think there's a lot of people 
that have cranky old grandparents push 

1275
00:56:08,361 --> 00:56:09,600
them motherfucker into that bed.
I go,

1276
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:11,100
look,
he's been delusional right now,

1277
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,140
but he's been telling us to kill him for
a couple of days.

1278
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,990
Just going to go ahead and do this,
but there's the double thing.

1279
00:56:15,991 --> 00:56:19,380
You have either people should do when 
they are young,

1280
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,770
what do you want to do in x amount of 
situations and sign it.

1281
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,840
Then the one that are less,
they change their mind,

1282
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:30,841
but that's what stakes or they pick 
somebody that the same way as they pick 

1283
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:31,570
somebody to manage their bank accounts.

1284
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,060
They picked somebody who can make those 
kind of decisions.

1285
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,120
Wow.
Because otherwise really you are in the 

1286
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,180
position where today you have a sick 
dog,

1287
00:56:40,181 --> 00:56:43,450
you can take them to the vet and they 
are gone in no time with no pain,

1288
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,540
but for human being,
you have to suffer every step of the way

1289
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:51,541
senior,
your body go to crap and it's very 

1290
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:51,890
uncomfortable with giving somebody the 
power to shut off a life.

1291
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,070
We're very uncomfortable with it.
Right?

1292
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:59,470
It's tricky and in my mind is that's you
know,

1293
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:04,471
when you love somebody,
you care for somebody and you see them 

1294
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:04,471
go down that path and that's what they 
want.

1295
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,610
That's the biggest thing you can do for 
them.

1296
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,960
Just let them die the way they want.
Yeah,

1297
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,210
no,
I see what you're saying.

1298
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:10,870
I mean,
I,

1299
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:12,790
I agree with you,
but I think people,

1300
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:15,370
like I said,
are very uncomfortable with the idea,

1301
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,720
especially religious folks.

1302
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,640
Yeah,
it's God the side when you get to yours,

1303
00:57:19,641 --> 00:57:22,750
so let you waste away for six more 
months in order.

1304
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,660
But essentially they do kill you anyway 
with painkillers.

1305
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,280
You know,
with a lot of people when they,

1306
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,910
when it's towards the end,
keep flooding you with painkillers.

1307
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:35,970
It's not pleasant because he's not that.
They don't feel anything or they don't 

1308
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:38,840
realize that anything they do realize 
that feel,

1309
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:44,550
don't realize it.
So it's like it's not a productive way 

1310
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:44,550
to go.
Fuck,

1311
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:48,130
I'm over the school of thought and just,
you know,

1312
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:52,960
just what happens when they cure that.
What happens when people don't get old?

1313
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,030
How many goddamn people are going to be 
here?

1314
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:58,600
If they figured out how to stop people 
from getting old and dying,

1315
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,580
we might have a real problem.
We might not even.

1316
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,240
We might have to build spaceships,
see it as well.

1317
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:09,240
There are too many people just at that 
point or will be more and more and more 

1318
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,770
if we start dying and keep people kept 
fucking right would be nuts.

1319
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:18,140
Jesus Christ at that point is where you 
can have the UFC have,

1320
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:18,590
uh,
you know,

1321
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,700
give a sword to some dudes,
put them in a cage and everything,

1322
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,760
go at each other for any show you know,
you have a disagreement with anybody or 

1323
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,870
anything.
Please circle it with swords in the 

1324
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,870
cage.
And it sounds really stupid to say,

1325
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:34,030
you know,
that people would devolve to that level,

1326
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:37,360
but when you get like a lot of people 
together,

1327
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:41,910
they sort of devalue each other when you
have too many of them in the,

1328
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:46,980
uh,
that deposit it in the future and 

1329
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:47,800
radiation sickness and who knows what 
the fuck's going to be going on now?

1330
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:49,300
Life becomes cheap people.

1331
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:54,390
It's kind of like even in the ancient 
world where people die left and right 

1332
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,271
all around and people were a lot less 
sensitive about a human life where you 

1333
00:58:57,271 --> 00:59:01,741
could have the gladiator or some people 
clap and think it's cool because it's 

1334
00:59:01,741 --> 00:59:01,990
like they see people dying left and 
right all the time,

1335
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,910
hey,
at least you got to die.

1336
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:06,410
After you train a bunch of minds.
You look like a hero,

1337
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,780
Eh,
you've got your head chopped off,

1338
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:10,000
but hey,
you know you are going to die anyway,

1339
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:12,370
six months in some other way,
so might as well.

1340
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,100
Isn't it amazing when you really stop 
and think about it?

1341
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:20,101
Isn't it incredible that people ever got
past ancient Rome we ever got to today?

1342
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,400
Think how nutty those assholes were?
The people were finding lines with 

1343
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,680
swords and shit.
Do it throw lines at people.

1344
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,390
God Damn what?

1345
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:34,390
A bunch of crazy assholes.
Two weeks ago some guy emails me from 

1346
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:38,141
the history channel and say,
are you by any chance an expert on 

1347
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:38,580
Caligula the Roman emperor?
And like,

1348
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,160
not really.
I mean,

1349
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:42,440
I read to my Roman historian stuff,
but he's like,

1350
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,850
perfect.
Just come on,

1351
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,160
read my email,
it's like,

1352
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,600
Yo,
you sound great because you've known 

1353
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:51,600
you've got a book that you looked at 
once.

1354
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,710
So I was an expert on Caligula.
The history channel is awesome.

1355
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,570
It was,
but it was cool actually.

1356
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:58,250
They did their homework.
I read all their stuff.

1357
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,410
They was all on the spot,
you know,

1358
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,790
funnier than the history channel when 
they got to do that.

1359
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,310
Comes onto sasquatch expert.
Right.

1360
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,410
Like what it's been lately.
And how,

1361
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:14,780
so,
so how much did you have to know for 

1362
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:14,780
them to use you?
You know,

1363
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,340
I was actually surprised that I knew 
more than I thought I did,

1364
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:21,770
but you know,
it's not like I'm the expert because I 

1365
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:21,770
wanted to highlight or add something.

1366
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:21,920
But then I was like,
hey man,

1367
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:25,700
I don't remember all this stuff.
Did you have to research it before?

1368
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:26,390
I was like,
cool shit.

1369
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:27,840
They bet their homework,
you know?

1370
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:33,200
So I did that.
He read the whole thing and everything 

1371
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,830
and to make the connection fast there.
So you don't think about it for five 

1372
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:35,830
needle.
It's going,

1373
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:35,830
uh,
you know,

1374
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,410
but Culligan man,
crazy motherfucker.

1375
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,180
That guy was,
I don't mind sort of wild,

1376
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,230
I mean Caligula was sort of,
you know,

1377
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:45,020
to the 10th power,
but Roman Culture in general,

1378
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:48,370
Jesus Christ,
this guy's were violent with pointed.

1379
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:49,470
I mean,
you know,

1380
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,380
today there's the,
uh,

1381
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,790
you shoot it and killed people in ways 
that are cruel and unusual.

1382
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,060
All of them,
they are all about,

1383
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:57,800
you know,
the more violent,

1384
01:00:57,801 --> 01:01:02,801
painful and public we can make it,
the better it will make a statement to 

1385
01:01:02,801 --> 01:01:04,860
the fact that you don't fuck with the 
state.

1386
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:11,320
That's bizarre.
Virta,

1387
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,280
how did Brian Go?

1388
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,940
That was,
that's what you get for shit.

1389
01:01:28,941 --> 01:01:30,350
And outside of that bathroom right 
there.

1390
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:33,170
She just went right there.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1391
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:38,171
that,
that break in the podcast was Brian got 

1392
01:01:38,171 --> 01:01:38,660
locked outside and he was banging on the
door.

1393
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:41,090
Sorry,
Brian,

1394
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:46,091
you silly goose it.
Comedy Club has like these automated 

1395
01:01:46,091 --> 01:01:48,551
locks when they're closed.
And so I went out to go because we're 

1396
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:51,550
not supposed to shit in his bathroom.
So because it shits and makes everybody 

1397
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:51,550
smell the shit.
Right?

1398
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:55,931
But no one's working today.
There were some people here are the 

1399
01:01:55,931 --> 01:01:55,931
word.
Okay.

1400
01:01:55,931 --> 01:01:55,931
So I didn't want.
Alright,

1401
01:01:55,931 --> 01:01:56,810
so where were we?
Where were we talking about?

1402
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,190
Crazy Romans.
Oh yeah.

1403
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,200
How,
how amazing that culture was.

1404
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:02,810
A bunch of savages.
People got through that.

1405
01:02:02,811 --> 01:02:04,850
That's we our ancestors of people.
You know,

1406
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:09,851
some,
some of us are at least of of people 

1407
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:09,851
that live there.
It's not like people went extinct back.

1408
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:09,950
No.
Far From It.

1409
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,640
What a,
what a weird time that have been.

1410
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:14,390
Huh?
What a ship roll.

1411
01:02:14,391 --> 01:02:17,570
The dice that is getting born and you're
living in ancient Rome.

1412
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:21,330
It was spun out.
UFC started both the people who hated it

1413
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:25,080
and the people who loved it compared to 
the gladiators gladiator opening.

1414
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,200
We,
we just abandoned it into the new one is

1415
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:30,330
fucking crazy and seemed unusual or new 
ones.

1416
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:31,610
Amazing.
But the,

1417
01:02:31,611 --> 01:02:32,080
the,
the,

1418
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:34,590
the gladiator opening was on for a long 
time.

1419
01:02:34,591 --> 01:02:36,600
Everyone's just like,
who is this gladiator dude?

1420
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:39,120
What is all this about?
Rubbing dirt in his hands and shit.

1421
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,210
And it was just like,
what,

1422
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,890
you know with the Italian music,
you know?

1423
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:48,630
And then it's the opening onto the,
the new.

1424
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,430
The new opening.
Is Wick it though?

1425
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:50,680
Yeah.

1426
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:52,250
Huh?

1427
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,610
The gladiators,
what was Caligula's deal quickly.

1428
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,910
It was completely out of his fucking 
mind basically.

1429
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:02,230
Was He,
do you think he was clinically insane or

1430
01:03:02,231 --> 01:03:05,610
you think it was just mad with power?
I think that's the beginning of it.

1431
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:10,780
Then of course,
you're gonna operate in an environment 

1432
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:10,780
where,
uh,

1433
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:10,780
you know,
your Ankle Keel,

1434
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:15,120
soul of your family or brothers and 
sisters and her mom to the point that 

1435
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,950
she was a scenario and then gets there 
to start to that,

1436
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,960
you know,
that's the environment you grew up 

1437
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,851
around Jesus,
even if you are totally saying you 

1438
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:26,761
started going elite along over the edge,
why they do that to everybody because 

1439
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:31,321
they are a main bus starts and uh,
they protected their own power and 

1440
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:32,890
anybody that they felt could be a threat
to their power,

1441
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,320
they would get rid of them in fairly 
nasty ways.

1442
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:36,910
Price.

1443
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,980
No,
he's no different than any gang or any,

1444
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,600
you know,
it's human nature that way.

1445
01:03:40,601 --> 01:03:42,340
Where at its worse.
Yeah,

1446
01:03:42,341 --> 01:03:44,440
because there was no rules.
Essentially they were,

1447
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:46,800
they were calling the shots.
It's amazingly,

1448
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:51,010
people ever get to a point of royalty 
that people allow that hustle.

1449
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:56,220
You know?
It's a very strange hustle that even 

1450
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:56,630
though there's no fucking food,
everybody's starving.

1451
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,310
No one,
you know,

1452
01:03:57,311 --> 01:03:58,900
there's no prosperity.
There's no books.

1453
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:04,080
People are so silly.
They'll believe that this one guy is 

1454
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,470
worth more than everybody else controls 
their armies and he's their noble leader

1455
01:04:05,471 --> 01:04:06,220
and.
But that would.

1456
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:09,400
That would be a cool job.
I sign up for that after you guys pulled

1457
01:04:09,401 --> 01:04:13,150
that job off and then somebody would 
kill you with a sword.

1458
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:14,680
I think today I started,
well,

1459
01:04:14,681 --> 01:04:15,490
I started saying,
no,

1460
01:04:15,491 --> 01:04:20,491
most people suck and I have a disability
thing that I want to be the king of the 

1461
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:21,190
universe.
That would be great.

1462
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:25,930
That I think every smart person thinks 
that there would be an awesome king.

1463
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:27,130
I would be different.
Listen,

1464
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:29,560
there's a lot of things.
It'd be assholes or I was the king.

1465
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,810
That's how every cart gets caught,
gets started,

1466
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,610
right?
Some guy comes along and goes,

1467
01:04:33,611 --> 01:04:34,660
listen,
these other cults,

1468
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,750
they don't fuck their doors the way I 
would do it.

1469
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,570
All needs to the lab really nice and as 
long as I'm uncontrolled,

1470
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:43,960
trust me or I'm really,
really honest and objective about this.

1471
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,520
When is,
when are we going to fucking figure this

1472
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:48,730
out?

1473
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,590
So I got my results back for my physical
Joe.

1474
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:56,560
And you had a physical.
I guy at full physical.

1475
01:04:56,570 --> 01:05:01,150
They tested blood every month and they 
said that I'm like 100 percent.

1476
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:02,380
Everything's fine.
My cholesterol.

1477
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:05,110
It's exactly perfect.
Like the only thing that was bad,

1478
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:06,520
he's like,
just take a little bit of d,

1479
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,530
You don't get how much do you.
And I'm like,

1480
01:05:08,531 --> 01:05:09,210
no,
I don't cut out.

1481
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,140
So he's like,
just get some over the counter,

1482
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,780
dee the you'll be fine,
but you're just a slight.

1483
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,020
No,
that's good.

1484
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,200
That's good.
And no stds.

1485
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:22,030
My first AIDS test mooching off of a 
test,

1486
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:24,580
but you got a real one now.
Congratulations.

1487
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:27,100
I'm glad you know Diane.
That's awesome.

1488
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,750
Yeah,
that is good.

1489
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,490
That's a monkey off your back,
right?

1490
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:31,220
Totally.
That's,

1491
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:36,690
you know,
I kind of feel like I eat somewhat 

1492
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:39,391
healthy.
Like what I'll do is I'll eat healthy 

1493
01:05:39,391 --> 01:05:39,391
and then I'll have a shitty day where 
I'll eat fucking pizza.

1494
01:05:39,391 --> 01:05:39,680
You know?
So it,

1495
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:43,510
I think I have the a good up and down.
Isn't it crazy that your va,

1496
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:46,720
your body actually produces a vitamin by
looking at the sun?

1497
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,100
Yeah.
You're out in the sun.

1498
01:05:48,101 --> 01:05:53,101
Your body produces vitamin D.
that's why when you see like George St 

1499
01:05:53,101 --> 01:05:53,101
Pierre,
when he's fighting and he gets Tan,

1500
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:58,320
that getting pampered like that is 
actually actually makes you perform 

1501
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:58,320
better.
There's nothing nuts.

1502
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:02,020
That fucking crazy.
Getting a Tan actually makes you perform

1503
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:04,120
better as a fighter.
Like what?

1504
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:08,290
What is the bad part about having a tea?
Not Much d though.

1505
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,080
Like if you were an extreme case,
would you just be like,

1506
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:11,680
oh I can't.

1507
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,330
Yeah,
you'd be fucked.

1508
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,580
It's really bad for you.
I really.

1509
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:19,770
Yeah.
I think that's an issue with the people 

1510
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:19,770
that live in really cloudy climates as 
well.

1511
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:19,840
Like Seattle.
Yeah,

1512
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,700
I bet they have a problem.
We keep going.

1513
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:26,050
Just Seattle today.
Seattle called them heaven.

1514
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:29,520
See Cock.
Seattle is a cool place.

1515
01:06:29,521 --> 01:06:30,340
Well,
how dare you.

1516
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,020
Yeah,
I look so beautiful up there.

1517
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:37,440
Oh by the way,
somebody told me they just got back 

1518
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,420
again from Tempe or Phoenix,
Arizona and went to that new club and an

1519
01:06:38,421 --> 01:06:43,421
Arizona.
It is the most amazing place ever and 

1520
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:44,440
that you would love it.
It's 600 seats,

1521
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,930
but they have.
They have like a person that follows you

1522
01:06:46,931 --> 01:06:48,460
around let's like your own like,
Hey,

1523
01:06:48,461 --> 01:06:50,770
can I get you something?
Like you each have your own individual,

1524
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,940
individual person,
a Sam triple.

1525
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:55,120
He went there and just had like a crazy 
party.

1526
01:06:55,121 --> 01:07:00,121
He said it was.
He saw somebody doing shit in the 

1527
01:07:00,121 --> 01:07:02,940
elevator,
this elevator walk up and then people 

1528
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,390
were having sex in it and stuff.
It says it's awesome.

1529
01:07:04,391 --> 01:07:07,290
It's a party.
So check that it's the,

1530
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:09,340
you know the one I'm talking about right
there,

1531
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,450
having sex there.

1532
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:15,820
What's going on?
Why don't want to give away Sam story 

1533
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:16,510
because he hasn't said it yet because he
has a naughty show at night.

1534
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:16,930
So.
Oh,

1535
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:21,931
so he's going to say it tonight?
I think so it's just how many podcasts 

1536
01:07:21,931 --> 01:07:21,931
are you doing in this day?
Three today.

1537
01:07:21,931 --> 01:07:21,940
Should we?
How?

1538
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,740
How are you going to listen to other 
people talk?

1539
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,020
It's impossible.
How can you.

1540
01:07:25,021 --> 01:07:30,021
How are you going to do this?
You gotta you gotTa shut your ears off 

1541
01:07:30,021 --> 01:07:30,021
after awhile.
Huh?

1542
01:07:30,021 --> 01:07:31,180
Do you go numb?
Just know it's just kind of meditate.

1543
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:31,960
Well,
listen to it,

1544
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,150
you know.
Wow.

1545
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:37,540
It's a lot of jobs aren't guest.

1546
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,880
We need to have a religious question and
answer podcasts with you.

1547
01:07:41,881 --> 01:07:46,881
How about that?
Let's do the shit would not be fucking 

1548
01:07:46,881 --> 01:07:49,911
bad ass.
How people that have questions to 

1549
01:07:49,911 --> 01:07:49,911
religion,
they contact you and then they could buy

1550
01:07:49,911 --> 01:07:54,831
your books to what is,
what is your one that you published 

1551
01:07:54,831 --> 01:07:54,831
recently on disinfect?
What is that called?

1552
01:07:54,831 --> 01:07:57,600
It's called the 50 seats.
They are not supposed to know religion.

1553
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:02,870
And the genesis of this was kind of 
interesting because originally phd from 

1554
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:03,990
book about religion and he was,
you know,

1555
01:08:03,991 --> 01:08:04,980
these big,
thick,

1556
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:07,150
heavy book and that they are like,
yeah,

1557
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:07,920
you know,
that's sweet,

1558
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:09,570
but we're in the business of selling 
books.

1559
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,060
So give us something,
you know,

1560
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:13,230
what is the big thick work?
What was that going to be about?

1561
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,420
It was,
um,

1562
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:15,980
that's kind of looking at

1563
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:20,330
old basically what the approach that 
Bruce Lee added to martial arts,

1564
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:22,660
I was trying to play,
adapted to religions,

1565
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:27,850
sort of like taking a bunch of different
religions to look at what all the big 

1566
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,750
questions are a look at what some of the
answers that are out there to make up 

1567
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,130
your own thing as you go.
And uh,

1568
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,360
because ultimately to me that's the only
thing that anybody does,

1569
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,050
you know,
it's,

1570
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,720
I'm making call Legion college 
philosophically.

1571
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:44,090
Whatever makes you feel good about 
bottom line is a way of life.

1572
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:47,480
And so I was like,
do your own work to see what's out there

1573
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,250
and come up with your own answers that 
way.

1574
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:53,900
And actually now that we did this one,
they decided to go for it.

1575
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:57,020
So I think I will publish the other one 
toward the end of the year,

1576
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,970
you know,
in end of 2012.

1577
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:03,020
So this would be a really big book.
They asked me to cut it a bit and it's a

1578
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:08,021
good idea because there's too much stuff
and people will be like halfway through 

1579
01:09:08,021 --> 01:09:08,870
what I go back.
It's no more but uh,

1580
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:10,300
so yeah,
I'll do that one,

1581
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:14,270
cutting it a bit and um,
so that one I was super excited about,

1582
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:19,271
but back then they are actually smart 
because they know that this kind of 

1583
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:19,271
stuff,
sales because he's um,

1584
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:20,710
quicker,
funny,

1585
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:21,680
weird,
random,

1586
01:09:21,681 --> 01:09:23,980
informative stories in and out,
you know,

1587
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:25,580
you read the one next,
you know,

1588
01:09:25,581 --> 01:09:27,080
you don't feel like you're liking that 
one,

1589
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:28,460
boom.
You jump to the next one.

1590
01:09:28,461 --> 01:09:31,370
So there's 50 of them and uh,
but yeah,

1591
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:36,371
it was,
it was weird because when I originally 

1592
01:09:36,371 --> 01:09:38,710
signed up to do it,
that was in as now I'm really happy I 

1593
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:38,960
did it when I started,
I was like,

1594
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:40,340
Eh,
I needed money.

1595
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:41,750
I guess so sure.
What the hell,

1596
01:09:41,751 --> 01:09:45,700
why not?
But in my initial mom and Danny was in a

1597
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,080
shitty period of my life because I 
signed on,

1598
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:53,081
it was like January 2011 or something 
and I said sure,

1599
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:55,720
I'll get it done.
And they like do it by April.

1600
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,890
Like okay,
that's a little tight,

1601
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,580
but sure I can do it.
Then that's when everything went to shit

1602
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:03,860
with my wife,
six weeks in the hospital,

1603
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:08,861
horrible things.
And then the second one though that was 

1604
01:10:08,861 --> 01:10:12,191
over,
I'm now responsible for a 19 month old 

1605
01:10:12,191 --> 01:10:16,031
baby to deal with there all the time and
I have a Montana enough read left to 

1606
01:10:16,031 --> 01:10:17,090
right this stuff.
And I'm like,

1607
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:20,060
Shit.
Now that's intense.

1608
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:23,270
And um,
but the thing is generally,

1609
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:25,880
I mean I break more laws than I can keep
track of,

1610
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:29,150
but one thing I do is I don't break my 
word ever.

1611
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,080
And I told them,
you know,

1612
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:32,930
I'll get it done.
They were even being nice about it.

1613
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:34,730
They were like,
we can push the deadline,

1614
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:35,510
but like,
no man,

1615
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:40,511
you know,
you wanted it done by then even eats 

1616
01:10:40,511 --> 01:10:40,970
good for me.
It gives me something to focus on.

1617
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:43,100
Right?
So they do dan being there,

1618
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:48,101
you know,
contemplating my navel thinking the 

1619
01:10:48,101 --> 01:10:48,101
word.
So I have something to do.

1620
01:10:48,101 --> 01:10:49,670
And not only that,
but it has to be funny,

1621
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:54,850
lighthearted at a time when my life is 
really not needed or funny or 

1622
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:58,601
lighthearted and sweets.
It was actually good therapy for me 

1623
01:10:58,601 --> 01:10:58,601
because I could,
uh,

1624
01:10:58,601 --> 01:11:03,580
you know,
while I'm giving my daughter meal come 

1625
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:04,220
thinking about what the hell is the next
line and I get to make it snappy,

1626
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:06,510
fast fashion,
but funding,

1627
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:10,120
but I think I could do for myself 
because I'm,

1628
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:15,160
you know,
as soon as you write while you were 

1629
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,051
holding the baby,
as he literally got to the why where I 

1630
01:11:17,051 --> 01:11:18,330
would dream about what I was going to 
write at night.

1631
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,300
I would fall asleep.
Like I finish writing,

1632
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:26,301
I pass out,
I dream about what I'm going to write 

1633
01:11:26,301 --> 01:11:26,780
when my baby wakes up.
I'm like holding their feeding around.

1634
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:27,750
Like,
okay,

1635
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:30,930
look at that thing over the next line,
you know?

1636
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:34,350
And then the second one she would sleep.
That's when I would write the most.

1637
01:11:34,351 --> 01:11:35,820
Of course I would be like,
go,

1638
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:36,120
go,
go,

1639
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:36,420
go,
go,

1640
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:36,690
go,
go.

1641
01:11:36,691 --> 01:11:38,220
Okay.
Now bus out next day.

1642
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:41,550
Wow.
What a crazy fucking schedule.

1643
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:43,740
How long did you do that for?
A couple of months.

1644
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,470
It was maybe two other than to win 
enough months.

1645
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,000
That's how long it took to make the 
book.

1646
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:53,420
Well,
so it's 50 things that you're not 

1647
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:53,420
supposed to know about religion.
It's called give us one of them.

1648
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:54,630
What's a good one to see?
What's fun?

1649
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:59,930
Let's stick a big men coming up with the
titles was half of the phone.

1650
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,240
I'm,
I keep myself operating them.

1651
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:11,450
I have one chapter I think is kind of 
the stuff I was telling you earlier is 

1652
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:11,450
called.
If you are too stupid for them,

1653
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:16,251
you can always try confucianism.
That's always would make me popular in 

1654
01:12:16,251 --> 01:12:19,090
China.
Uh Oh,

1655
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,610
this is great.
There's this guy,

1656
01:12:20,611 --> 01:12:25,611
um,
the title of this one is God is wearing 

1657
01:12:25,611 --> 01:12:26,380
dragon robes and wants you to keep 
confusion.

1658
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:28,380
Assess.
This is an awesome story.

1659
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,750
Is in the 89,
this one,

1660
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,760
a Chinese guy became converted to 
Christianity and he started saying that 

1661
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:40,500
he was Jesus' younger brother,
that you had this vision of God that was

1662
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,560
wearing dragon polo shirts and told them
that Buddhism and Confucianism or crap 

1663
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:51,051
and it was his duty to stamp them out.
So he got their APP or this follower 

1664
01:12:51,051 --> 01:12:53,370
started preaching in the countryside,
gain all these people.

1665
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,760
They became so powerful that they carved
out their own state within China and 

1666
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,420
they said that this was going to be,
I forgot what it's called.

1667
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,670
It's something that I have to find it 
because there's just too good,

1668
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:05,760
but he was called something along the 
lines like a,

1669
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:09,000
the evan leaking dome of everlasting 
peace or something.

1670
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:14,720
Well,
the heavenly kingdom of everlasting 

1671
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,281
peace ended up with the debt of 20 
million people in the course of civil 

1672
01:13:16,281 --> 01:13:19,971
wars between the Chinese government or 
was pieced over these guys thrown into 

1673
01:13:19,971 --> 01:13:23,631
Medicare way and these kind of weird 
version of a Chinese fundamentalist 

1674
01:13:24,421 --> 01:13:26,910
Christianity fighting against that.
His guys.

1675
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,330
And eventually when they laid siege to 
the CT,

1676
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:32,160
he was telling his followers,
don't worry,

1677
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:35,430
God is on our side.
And of course he died shortly thereafter

1678
01:13:35,431 --> 01:13:37,410
by eating some boys on Missouri by 
mistake.

1679
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:39,000
And um,
and that was that.

1680
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:42,660
What year was this all going down?
I want to say meet 89,

1681
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:43,400
I think.
18,

1682
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,410
2017.
30.

1683
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:49,460
And how many people died in this 
conflict when t me $20 million.

1684
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:54,490
Yeah.
So one dude came along saying that he 

1685
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:57,741
was Jesus his brother and 20 million 
people died as a result of this one guy.

1686
01:13:58,231 --> 01:13:59,770
Is that essentially what you're saying?
Yeah.

1687
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:02,730
Typing,
going on 1858 and 64.

1688
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:03,900
And um,
yeah,

1689
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:08,740
that's.
And that's why is not supposed to know.

1690
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,040
He's like,
I've never heard about that.

1691
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,020
That's such an immense number of people 
that died.

1692
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:19,680
I mean,
what they fuck they get the numbers we 

1693
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:19,680
had the benefit of the doubt is maybe 50
meters old.

1694
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,400
How knows?
But you know,

1695
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,990
that's what some people have speculated 
that the number was.

1696
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,430
And how would they know?
Right.

1697
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,390
20 million people's a guests back then,
right?

1698
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,480
Of course.
And uh,

1699
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,730
but he's brutal civil war racking China 
for a band,

1700
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,600
which is one of the reasons why a bunch 
of Chinese people migrated to California

1701
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,720
at the time when there was the gold rush
is because south China was get the 

1702
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:39,720
indirect left and right.

1703
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:40,510
What's this dude's name again?
Uh,

1704
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:45,430
the guy's name was hung to something 
that's going to be a lot of people.

1705
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:47,730
Gonna want to play that guy on like 
video games.

1706
01:14:47,731 --> 01:14:52,731
It's going to be their name.
Go on as this bad motherfucker convinced

1707
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:55,740
a bunch people.
He was Jesus,

1708
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:56,840
his brother.
Shit.

1709
01:14:56,870 --> 01:15:01,870
I have no idea how to pronounce it.
That's a high level pimp game right 

1710
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:01,870
there.
Sign Hong does.

1711
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:04,660
She would try and I have no idea.
It's hard to pronounce.

1712
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,460
I make it tough.
How do you spell it?

1713
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:08,440
It's age.
Well,

1714
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,280
Chinese is spelled two different ways 
depending on now you,

1715
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:16,180
but the one that we're using was h o n g
and that's one word.

1716
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:18,430
And then the next word is x.
i,

1717
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:22,470
u q u a n.
wow.

1718
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:27,510
So good luck fixing on this.
It's really fascinating the way the 

1719
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:29,810
Chinese have a language,
you know,

1720
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,630
it's phonetic obviously because if 
they're,

1721
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:33,460
they have totally different characters 
that we have,

1722
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:36,910
but the way they've expressed it in like
the letters that we use.

1723
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:39,520
So it's bizarre really.
Some of the words are really strange,

1724
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,320
especially like with x's and them and 
shit.

1725
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:45,070
My wife,
my wife is Chinese and she was trying to

1726
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:50,100
teach me some Chinese and I was like,
I mean I couldn't say it because she 

1727
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:50,980
kind of hated Japanese people,
but I was thinking,

1728
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,170
Jesus,
couldn't you just be Japanese is so much

1729
01:15:53,171 --> 01:15:54,670
easier.
Japanese is easier to learn.

1730
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:56,850
Easier.
It's the way you read it,

1731
01:15:56,851 --> 01:16:00,500
it's kind of the way you pronounce it.
There's only one toe on it.

1732
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:04,660
It's easier.
Chinese is the same exact ward with tiny

1733
01:16:04,661 --> 01:16:06,970
different tax.
That means completely different things.

1734
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,730
And there are like four different tax 
ids for each ward.

1735
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,070
Oh No.
It's just like,

1736
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,750
oh no.
Can anybody say anything?

1737
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,200
So you think it's more complicated than 
English?

1738
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:20,290
English is a hard one to learn though 
for some reason.

1739
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,510
I mean I'm sure if that's where you come
from,

1740
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,190
if you speak Chinese or something,
yeah,

1741
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:29,191
English must be a pain in the ass,
but for anybody coming from a vaguely 

1742
01:16:29,191 --> 01:16:33,871
Latino background or anything,
any of the Western languages trying to 

1743
01:16:33,871 --> 01:16:35,020
pick up chain,
any tonal language like Chinese,

1744
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:36,180
Vietnamese,
some of those,

1745
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:38,640
it's just like that.

1746
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:42,700
It is pretty fucked up that we all speak
different languages.

1747
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:43,810
How many,
you know,

1748
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:48,811
I mean,
how many problems would be solved if 

1749
01:16:48,811 --> 01:16:51,541
everybody spoke one language that would 
be nice to solve anything at this point 

1750
01:16:51,731 --> 01:16:56,731
in time would it?
People hate each other from New York to 

1751
01:16:56,731 --> 01:16:56,731
Irvine,
so you don't.

1752
01:16:56,731 --> 01:16:57,910
You don't have to,
but it would out.

1753
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,070
You will be better than nothing.
That's for sure.

1754
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,450
It is pretty crazy how different 
languages are too.

1755
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,170
I mean the difference between like 
Chinese and Norway,

1756
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,710
Norwegian and Chinese accuser in a 
bigger difference.

1757
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,600
Is it even possible to get something 
more Chinese and you know,

1758
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:17,300
how about Chinese and African tribal 
languages for.

1759
01:17:17,301 --> 01:17:19,230
They're all.
They don't have the.

1760
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

1761
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,550
Yeah.
Awesome.

1762
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:27,770
That's fascinating man.
It's just so incredible how it evolves 

1763
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:29,600
differently in different areas,
but it all evolves.

1764
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:32,450
You know,
how many different languages are there?

1765
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:35,240
Are there hundreds?
Thousands.

1766
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:39,910
I'm going to go on some bullshit guys 
since say what?

1767
01:17:39,911 --> 01:17:43,510
Surviving today because of course their 
languages,

1768
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:44,970
but wait,
wait,

1769
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:49,580
but let me bullshit first.
Let's try surviving today.

1770
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:49,970
I want to say

1771
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,590
say

1772
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:52,790
the wind,
they're 50.

1773
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,070
I'll say

1774
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,950
176,
I'll say a thousand.

1775
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:03,030
I think you're actually closer.
The more I'm thinking about it because 

1776
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:04,450
there are a bunch of languages in the 
world.

1777
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:09,630
Oh my God.
They between six thousand eight hundred 

1778
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:09,630
and six thousand nine hundred distinct 
languages.

1779
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:11,470
The modern world.
Holy Shit.

1780
01:18:11,471 --> 01:18:13,840
Where we off?
Holy Shit.

1781
01:18:13,841 --> 01:18:16,510
Where we off?
You are the closest dude.

1782
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,010
Yeah,
but I,

1783
01:18:17,011 --> 01:18:19,910
I thought I thought I overshot it to be 
honest with you.

1784
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:21,760
I thought it was probably around 900.
Right?

1785
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:24,010
Holy Shit.
That's incredible.

1786
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:29,640
Well,
I mean 90 percent of that or languages 

1787
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,311
that are dying that are like 30 people 
in a tribe is still speak and clicking 

1788
01:18:32,651 --> 01:18:35,440
noises,
clicking noises.

1789
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:40,740
Well,
how bizarre is that when they have 

1790
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,361
places,
like there's some spots in the Amazon 

1791
01:18:42,361 --> 01:18:42,361
that they're,
you know,

1792
01:18:42,361 --> 01:18:45,400
just just recently discovered people in 
these tribes and the,

1793
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:48,750
this is the first contact that they're 
having with the modern world and they're

1794
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,400
in there with their own wacky language 
that they sit at.

1795
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,710
One of the few guys have had some 
contact with them.

1796
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:55,360
They promptly killed him.
So yeah.

1797
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:59,530
Good luck making contact again.
The someone made contact with him,

1798
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:03,020
there was one guy who was like an India 
from a different tribe,

1799
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:07,000
so he kind of understood their language,
but she also was,

1800
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:12,020
you know,
more immersed into mother and Lord and 

1801
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,041
they'll have less.
So he was kind of like in transition 

1802
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:14,041
between those two words and they.
Yeah,

1803
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:14,650
they killed.
Nobody knows why,

1804
01:19:14,651 --> 01:19:15,610
but yeah,
they walked him.

1805
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:20,970
Well,
I think they probably have heard that 

1806
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,891
some shit goes down when the loggers 
move in and you know that that is what 

1807
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,430
happens to these people probably.
Yeah.

1808
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:27,140
There's w.
What folks don't know is there was a,

1809
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,520
a bunch of people living.
I mean they are people.

1810
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:34,510
They're living like people used to live 
thousands of years ago.

1811
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:37,390
They're,
they're essentially essentially,

1812
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:43,140
you know,
living in ancient tribal lifestyle that 

1813
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,080
we didn't really even think existed 
anymore.

1814
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:48,130
They have their own handmade tools and 
weapons and you know,

1815
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:53,131
they're wearing like fucking crazy 
leaves on their dicks and shit and 

1816
01:19:53,131 --> 01:19:54,970
animal skins and it's there and they're 
still in there.

1817
01:19:54,971 --> 01:19:59,971
And then these people who are logging 
are going deeper and deeper into the 

1818
01:19:59,971 --> 01:20:02,070
forest and they're just cutting down at 
an astounding rate.

1819
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:07,071
Yeah.
And there's all these incredible 

1820
01:20:07,071 --> 01:20:08,250
medicines to be found there and all 
these different and animals that haven't

1821
01:20:08,251 --> 01:20:11,610
even been discovered yet and insects 
that haven't been discovered yet.

1822
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:14,860
And who knows what the fuck's in there 
and they're just shopping that shit down

1823
01:20:14,861 --> 01:20:19,861
and left and right.
And these people oftentimes are getting 

1824
01:20:19,861 --> 01:20:19,861
caught up in this where,
you know,

1825
01:20:19,861 --> 01:20:21,550
they had,
they lived there in that forest and that

1826
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:26,570
deep in there for thousands of years.
And then all of a sudden one day they 

1827
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:29,100
wake up and they're fucking,
they're there watching trees fall in the

1828
01:20:29,101 --> 01:20:29,770
distance,
you know,

1829
01:20:29,771 --> 01:20:31,140
like what the fuck is going on?

1830
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:36,350
And they just coming towards you.
It's an inevitable swarm of tree eating 

1831
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:40,020
machines and there are all these people,
these greedy people behind them and they

1832
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:43,470
don't want to move around you and 
they're going to chop your fucking trees

1833
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:44,480
down.
Get outta here.

1834
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,180
Yeah.
That's living like a savage.

1835
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:53,210
Yeah.
They're looking at him like you're 

1836
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:53,210
looking like a fucking.
He live in like a savage on here.

1837
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:53,210
What the fuck you doing?
Trapping and shit down.

1838
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,280
We have all those people had a wild life
for a long time.

1839
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,650
Who's to say their life isn't more 
interesting.

1840
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,170
This is doing Iowasca and fishing and 
shit.

1841
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,360
You know what I'm saying?
If you're pretty dope,

1842
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,180
you know what I mean?
If you get used to living in the jungle,

1843
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:07,470
it's a hard,
hard life,

1844
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:10,080
but there's a lot of food there.
You know,

1845
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:15,230
you could become it.
You could become food fucked up that to 

1846
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:20,630
zig when he should've zagged.
There's a thing called a Brazilian 

1847
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:23,760
wondering spider that kills you by 
giving you an erection until you die.

1848
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:30,720
It's fucking,
it has something to do with nitric oxide

1849
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:36,030
and uh,
which is like the same stuff that's in 

1850
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:36,210
the works and like Viagra and stuff that
makes your dick hard.

1851
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,070
And apparently this,
um,

1852
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:42,740
this spider hits you with it and it 
causes some crazy fucking reaction.

1853
01:21:42,741 --> 01:21:45,320
It's neurotoxin.
It's the most powerful neurotoxin.

1854
01:21:45,321 --> 01:21:50,321
None of the man and your whole body just
completely stiffens up and horrifying 

1855
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:54,420
agony.
And your Dick gets hard as fuck so hard.

1856
01:21:54,421 --> 01:21:59,421
It's like breaking like your Dick is in 
gorged and breaking and even if you 

1857
01:21:59,421 --> 01:22:01,320
survive it,
which most people don't survive,

1858
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:04,290
but even if you do survive,
your Dick will be destroyed.

1859
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,680
The deq would be useless.
It would just be a bag of bruises.

1860
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:10,170
Sound like fun.
That's just from one bite from one,

1861
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:13,830
but what if it just linked you and then 
you just had a really hard boner all the

1862
01:22:13,831 --> 01:22:18,831
time in their life.
Doesn't work that way if you just got a 

1863
01:22:18,831 --> 01:22:18,831
little bit.
It doesn't work that way,

1864
01:22:18,831 --> 01:22:18,831
but I do believe that

1865
01:22:18,831 --> 01:22:22,910
pharmaceutical companies are like 
investigating the effect that this thing

1866
01:22:22,911 --> 01:22:25,580
has on your body to develop new hard on 
medication.

1867
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:26,680
Yeah.
You know,

1868
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:29,220
developed substrate that gives you a 
hard on for a year.

1869
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,550
They're going to do.
That's the next thing you know,

1870
01:22:32,551 --> 01:22:34,800
like Viagra is like,
it's not effective enough.

1871
01:22:34,801 --> 01:22:36,900
What if I want to fuck 12 hours from now
I need.

1872
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:38,850
I need something a little more kick to 
it,

1873
01:22:38,851 --> 01:22:43,851
and they came up with Cialis.
They'll have like jeans will have these 

1874
01:22:43,851 --> 01:22:46,521
new pockets there.
These tubes that just kind of go up to 

1875
01:22:46,521 --> 01:22:49,311
the side where you just put your dick in
during the day because you have a rock 

1876
01:22:49,311 --> 01:22:49,311
part.
You don't want to,

1877
01:22:49,311 --> 01:22:53,930
you know,
you're gonna have a boner everyday 

1878
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:53,930
tubes,
you know,

1879
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:53,940
like you'll have like a little pocket to
put your ticket.

1880
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:57,000
They'll start selling new pockets and 
their tools trap.

1881
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,010
Right,
so it can move around with you.

1882
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:04,070
Yeah.
It's like a cargo pant pocket for your 

1883
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:04,070
deck there.
You're going to have to just point it up

1884
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,330
towards your belly button.
Go over the top.

1885
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,960
As you're walking everywhere,
all the articles are going to have a 

1886
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,760
belt buckle marks.
Periscopes there can start forming 

1887
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:20,761
different.
That might be actually the most 

1888
01:23:20,761 --> 01:23:20,761
comfortable with.

1889
01:23:20,761 --> 01:23:20,761
If you could just walk it straight up.
Yeah.

1890
01:23:20,761 --> 01:23:21,870
Yeah.
Just some sort of a tent.

1891
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:24,900
Put a dick tent over it.
You know,

1892
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:30,900
I know exactly what you mean.
That's

1893
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,800
in the jungle though.
Maybe the.

1894
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:36,850
Maybe these nice lagers are saving these
people for the life of perpetual.

1895
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:41,290
Yeah.
Death by hard on in the jungle.

1896
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,630
You ever see that movie?
Big River Man.

1897
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:47,770
No documentary about some crazy guy who 
swam the length of the Amazon River.

1898
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:53,130
It's disgusting.
Why did you got all kinds of fucking 

1899
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:56,040
parasites?
His skin and his body and his breathing 

1900
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,570
and drinking that water,
taking it in and Oh my God,

1901
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,700
it's because he's crazy.
He just is really,

1902
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:03,990
really funny,
crazy guy who liked to swim and be like,

1903
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:07,520
do these swim endurance things and uh,
you know,

1904
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,160
he would do it day after day after day 
and he would,

1905
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:12,010
he's getting delirious and shit.
It's a really strange,

1906
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:15,010
like documentation on this guy.
He's like,

1907
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,700
he had done a bunch of different 
endurance swims before and you know,

1908
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:24,070
get all these people behind them and 
it's a documentary that's taken by his 

1909
01:24:24,071 --> 01:24:24,550
son.

1910
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,520
It's really interesting because his son,
you know,

1911
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:31,600
is like watching this guy do all this 
nutty shit and sort of falling apart and

1912
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:34,100
all the different parasites he's getting
from this water.

1913
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:38,080
Oh fucking crazy man.
I can imagine that you're,

1914
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:39,660
you know,
that's your father and you'll keep it up

1915
01:24:39,661 --> 01:24:41,920
camera and going for the next 20 days as
the.

1916
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:43,450
It's just,
well not only that,

1917
01:24:43,451 --> 01:24:48,451
he would like jump off the boat into the
night in the middle of the night and 

1918
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:49,390
start swimming and then have to follow 
after him with spotlights and shit.

1919
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:54,850
This crazy ass hole with this crocodiles
out there and this guy is swimming in 

1920
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:57,760
the Nile River and he survived.
He survived.

1921
01:24:57,850 --> 01:24:59,350
Yeah.
Fascinating.

1922
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:02,210
You know,
and he actually kind of looked like once

1923
01:25:02,211 --> 01:25:04,010
he cleaned up and dried out and 
everything like that,

1924
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,140
he actually looked like you made it 
through.

1925
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:07,250
Okay.
Which is even more crazy.

1926
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:07,950
Yeah.
That isn't that.

1927
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,610
Yeah,
there's just some dudes out there,

1928
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,930
but I mean that's the random.
And so he told you,

1929
01:25:11,931 --> 01:25:16,931
you know,
you're going to fucking die in the 

1930
01:25:16,931 --> 01:25:18,271
safest place in the water because 
everybody could fall on you or 

1931
01:25:18,271 --> 01:25:20,451
something.
Or you can sweeten the Amazon for 

1932
01:25:20,451 --> 01:25:20,451
thousands of miles and come out fine.
It's like,

1933
01:25:20,451 --> 01:25:21,460
what the fuck,
man.

1934
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:26,590
Really.
It's a weird thing that people have for 

1935
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:27,160
wanting to do difficult things.
You know?

1936
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:32,210
I tell him,
I've always felt that way about like 

1937
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:32,210
Mount Everest.
I had a joke about it.

1938
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,670
Like it's just because something's hard 
to do doesn't mean it's good to do.

1939
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:40,030
See people get a little confused.
It is because the difficult things to do

1940
01:25:40,241 --> 01:25:42,450
in this life usually come with reward.
You know,

1941
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:43,500
your risk yourself,
you know,

1942
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:48,670
you leave your job,
you start your own business and that 

1943
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,550
reward is how it worked and now you're 
making it financially.

1944
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:55,580
Graduations you're a success.
There was a risk and there's reward in 

1945
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:56,170
that case.
That's not,

1946
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:59,680
that doesn't look like the reward is 
worth it.

1947
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:00,540
No,
no,

1948
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:01,060
no,
no.

1949
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:04,190
If you could stop

1950
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:06,200
put,
letting.

1951
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:11,320
Is there a way that you could ever say 
that anyone running for president cannot

1952
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:15,950
talk about religion?
It's almost like even if you believe,

1953
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:21,180
it's almost like you shouldn't be 
allowed to talk about it in the 

1954
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:22,320
political process.
It's almost like cheating,

1955
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,730
you know,
it's almost like you're not,

1956
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:26,550
you know,
you're,

1957
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,520
you're going after your people,
man.

1958
01:26:28,521 --> 01:26:30,200
You just trying to get your people 
divorce,

1959
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:32,120
like will do it.
Of course.

1960
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,530
That's our little chunk of fewer 
opioids.

1961
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,630
There's a.
It was supposed to be that way though,

1962
01:26:35,631 --> 01:26:36,220
wasn't it?
Yeah.

1963
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:37,600
This time.
Uh,

1964
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:38,450
yeah.
But I mean,

1965
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:40,660
I think honestly what happened is that 
Utopian about,

1966
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,910
so could they offer early dress waters 
for so long that they,

1967
01:26:43,911 --> 01:26:46,640
people got really annoyed by it.
He was like,

1968
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:49,970
I'm done enough of this shit.
They were chopping each other's bowls.

1969
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:53,300
So the fact that you would read this 
book and I read this one hour about what

1970
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,980
you do,
whatever the hell do you want to,

1971
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:58,160
let's keep it already John Sattler for 
politics and be done with it.

1972
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:03,190
You know.
And so today in a lot of Europe you go 

1973
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:03,770
to churches and they are a tourist 
attraction and so,

1974
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:08,771
you know,
in the countryside now people are still 

1975
01:27:08,771 --> 01:27:10,631
into it,
but in most of the cte seats they read 

1976
01:27:10,631 --> 01:27:13,690
our knocked.
Most people don't go us whole different 

1977
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:17,681
game I think is the only modern 
industrialized country where there's 

1978
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:20,750
these levels of insane embark on their 
religion.

1979
01:27:20,751 --> 01:27:25,751
I mean today there is no way that a good
Aha guy equal never even bother running 

1980
01:27:25,751 --> 01:27:29,861
for president is.
Has there ever been a time where an 

1981
01:27:29,861 --> 01:27:29,861
atheist could have ran for president and
not anyone else?

1982
01:27:29,861 --> 01:27:30,320
No,
never.

1983
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:35,370
I mean,
some guys where we are like Thomas 

1984
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:39,340
Jefferson or something,
he basically 83rd the Bible by cutting 

1985
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:40,730
up all the stuff that he thought was 
crap,

1986
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,100
which was most of it and saving,
you know,

1987
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:45,310
like he took out out of the gospels.

1988
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:47,580
He took out the virgin birth,
the miracles,

1989
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:52,600
the,
all of the stuff that he knew his mind 

1990
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,090
was a bunch of crap.
He saved up the pirates of Jesus that he

1991
01:27:53,091 --> 01:27:55,880
likes saying he's,
he's a sweet guy.

1992
01:27:55,881 --> 01:27:58,550
He tells you to be nice to each other.
I like that part where we keep it up.

1993
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,210
Art and that became the Jefferson Bible.
He said he said averse.

1994
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,180
How long was his Bible?
Like 50 patients bridge much.

1995
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:10,181
But I don't remember how long ago it was
about and what a cocky dude.

1996
01:28:10,761 --> 01:28:11,630
Yeah.
Things.

1997
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:16,430
But at the same time he was a dick.
I mean,

1998
01:28:16,431 --> 01:28:19,440
it's probably a dick at the same time.
Uh,

1999
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,640
you know,
come on man.

2000
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,430
You can't edit that thing,
but you know what,

2001
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:25,640
you don't get to edit it by yourself.
The fact is everybody does.

2002
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:27,740
They just don't tell you because,
you know,

2003
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:32,741
everybody highlights the power day like,
and they completely keep on the parts 

2004
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:33,860
they don't like and so they come up with
their own thing anyway.

2005
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,980
At least the guy who had the guts to 
say,

2006
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,750
this is exactly what I'm doing.
What everybody else does it,

2007
01:28:38,751 --> 01:28:39,590
they just,
you know.

2008
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:41,550
Well,
there's always so much contradiction.

2009
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:43,700
Then.
How about religious tattoos?

2010
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:51,020
That's like strictly prohibited.
I know that's crazy,

2011
01:28:51,021 --> 01:28:51,980
but when the Bible,
yeah,

2012
01:28:51,981 --> 01:28:53,450
you'll get the,
you'll get that.

2013
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:54,590
In fact that we have,
for example,

2014
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:57,440
a lot of Jewish people know what that 
tool is not on the,

2015
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:59,320
you get,
um,

2016
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,980
you get all the sinks,
like a white Jewish

2017
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,800
girls with tattoos at hot.
But she's a gambler.

2018
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,710
Just rolling that dice.
There's one that I threw in there that's

2019
01:29:08,711 --> 01:29:09,740
um,
uh,

2020
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,020
what did I call that one?
It's,

2021
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:16,050
Oh,
it's titled the Christian 

2022
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,921
fundamentalist.
I would love to introduce you to my pet 

2023
01:29:17,921 --> 01:29:20,911
King Cobra.
And there's actually a reason for that 

2024
01:29:20,911 --> 01:29:23,730
because the in the gospels and there's 
the story of Jesus telling you that if 

2025
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:25,540
you really have faith in him,
if you are a pedestrian,

2026
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:30,150
Ndi fade and all of that,
you could take boys on snakes,

2027
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:32,800
could our soul to you and bite you and 
you'll be totally fine.

2028
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:34,930
And I was like,
wow,

2029
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:40,170
you know,
if that's what Jesus is seen and 

2030
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:40,170
different diseases,
what you guys believe,

2031
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:40,290
Hey,
let me.

2032
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:45,300
But in Gavin the snakes that savvy to 
try and it's like one of two things are 

2033
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:49,261
going on.
Either you know that the stuff you 

2034
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:53,011
believe in is crap and you don't really 
believe it or you know that you are.

2035
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:55,330
That there are no good Christians 
because.

2036
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:57,250
Sorry,
that's not the way it works today.

2037
01:29:57,251 --> 01:30:02,251
I don't care how much faith you have.
It's like nobody can survive taking the 

2038
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:06,450
boys on our staff,
on our or your Alameda deadline in the 

2039
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:07,500
Bible is crap.
And he was in,

2040
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:09,670
you know,
it was booting there by somebody else,

2041
01:30:09,671 --> 01:30:14,671
but he's not real.
In which case it doesn't exactly say 

2042
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:15,460
great things about the reliability of 
the whole thing,

2043
01:30:15,461 --> 01:30:16,930
but it's like there's no getting out of 
it.

2044
01:30:16,931 --> 01:30:19,150
It's like,
how do you get out of that?

2045
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:19,690
You don't know.

2046
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:25,230
I had a conversation with a guy recently
there was telling me that there are 

2047
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:27,400
people that believe so much that they 
can drink poison and not die.

2048
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,050
And I was like,
oh man,

2049
01:30:29,051 --> 01:30:30,760
what a crazy conversation we're having 
here.

2050
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,880
I doubt that,
you know,

2051
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,870
have you seen,
this is not scientific.

2052
01:30:34,871 --> 01:30:36,730
This is not something that's been proven
by studies.

2053
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,880
Like does someone say that they 
absolutely believe if someone can take 

2054
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:41,880
poison and not die because their belief 
in themselves,

2055
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:46,180
there's only one way to tell homie 
that's my take that poison.

2056
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:46,540
Like,
Hey,

2057
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:49,690
I'm not saying he's not through.
Let's try convinced me aim.

2058
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,880
If you're right,
you'll have $0

2059
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:58,020
people following and you'll be the 
greatest asset to Christianity ever 

2060
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:01,540
because you made a millions converts and
they're actually to tell the defendant.

2061
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:03,310
Some of these guys really are serious 
about it.

2062
01:31:03,311 --> 01:31:06,730
There have been a bunch of people were 
particularly in a,

2063
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,320
um,
in a lot of Carolinas,

2064
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:15,330
Tennessee,
a few places where there was this 

2065
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:15,330
tradition of a snake handlers that they 
would,

2066
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:15,330
uh,
you know,

2067
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:17,110
let poisonous snakes by them and you 
know,

2068
01:31:17,111 --> 01:31:20,610
quite a few of these guys died,
miserable dads and then some of them are

2069
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:25,611
boys and wasn't that much,
so they managed to survive and all of 

2070
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:25,611
that up.
I'm like,

2071
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:25,930
Damn,
really?

2072
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,530
Jesus Christ,
what a way to go,

2073
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:31,720
uh,
butts.

2074
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,300
But I love it when you ask things like 
that.

2075
01:31:34,301 --> 01:31:34,840
I'm like,
Hey,

2076
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:37,390
I'm not telling you it's crap.
I'm not saying he's not through.

2077
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,220
It's there,
let's test it.

2078
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:42,240
That just led just that way.

2079
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,010
People need something,
man.

2080
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:47,770
They're always going to need something 
whether they're going to need,

2081
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,230
you know,
liberalism,

2082
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:53,560
conservativism,
he did a path.

2083
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:58,820
They need someone that just chop out the
brush for them and point them in the 

2084
01:31:58,820 --> 01:31:59,680
right direction.
Whether it's Christianity,

2085
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:00,010
whether it's

2086
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:05,040
atheism.
I've met atheists that might as well 

2087
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:05,040
have been religious stuff that they're 
just,

2088
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:08,890
they're so anti religion that there,
it's a,

2089
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:13,891
it's a religion in and of itself.
I had a chapter that I was supposed to 

2090
01:32:13,891 --> 01:32:17,431
go in the book that was basically saying
that eight k stand hardcore 

2091
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:21,151
fundamentalist are doing separated at 
birth because they are both based on 

2092
01:32:21,151 --> 01:32:23,260
certainty on how the universe works and 
all of that,

2093
01:32:23,261 --> 01:32:26,620
but then my publisher decided,
did you already are offending people,

2094
01:32:26,621 --> 01:32:29,200
have 7 million different religions you 
want to have.

2095
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,530
We want to sell some books about us 
keeping the eight.

2096
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:36,560
This chapter,
let's when they both have in common is 

2097
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,821
they would all shit their pants if they 
saw an alien that I think everybody 

2098
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:44,800
that's the trump card is the aliens.
If a real fucking alien battleship,

2099
01:32:44,801 --> 01:32:46,570
like all these stupid movies that keep 
coming out,

2100
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:49,450
there's another stupid movie coming out 
where it comes out of the ocean and then

2101
01:32:49,451 --> 01:32:54,451
they fucking go to or the American 
military to shoot cannons at this 

2102
01:32:54,451 --> 01:32:58,030
fucking crazy robot monstrosity thing 
that pops out of the ocean.

2103
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:00,400
Damn,
I missed the jewel of cinematography.

2104
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:04,690
It's not out yet.
It's coming think in March,

2105
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:07,960
but whatever it is,
it's like is a never ending theme.

2106
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:13,030
Right?
There's never anything with someone way 

2107
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:15,241
smarter than us coming down and just 
fucking our world up hurling missiles 

2108
01:33:15,431 --> 01:33:17,230
through buildings.
Buildings explode.

2109
01:33:17,231 --> 01:33:22,231
It's like a standard vision of a Chinese
adult when nobody could do are all these

2110
01:33:23,411 --> 01:33:25,810
weird stuff going on with my body and 
nobody could figure it out.

2111
01:33:25,811 --> 01:33:28,150
This guy was amazing.
He just makes me like that,

2112
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:33,510
but the last time I saw him he's found a
half hour telling me about there is our 

2113
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:36,961
mother sheeps calming at the end of the 
of 2012 and who knows whether they are 

2114
01:33:36,961 --> 01:33:41,671
nice or not.
He was really good even though I was 

2115
01:33:41,671 --> 01:33:41,671
like,
what if he's right?

2116
01:33:41,671 --> 01:33:46,650
Seriously,
seriously was when old motherfuckers 

2117
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:50,070
with their degrees and in suit and tie 
all the top doctors from Kaiser and all 

2118
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:50,070
of that.

2119
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:54,540
Couldn't figure anything out for me.
Him these crazy eyes and do it in the 

2120
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:54,630
use.
Acupuncture,

2121
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:56,820
acupuncture he gave me.
RBC was.

2122
01:33:56,821 --> 01:33:59,410
I mean I was something like,
I'm going to throw anything,

2123
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:02,200
but the dude is literally in this hole 
in the wall.

2124
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:06,070
He's wedding five watches.
I don't ask why or anything.

2125
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,420
That's where all his baby mama was 
standing all over the world,

2126
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:14,920
so like that.
But what do I have to lose at this point

2127
01:34:14,921 --> 01:34:16,180
and why?
The guy fixed it.

2128
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:19,060
He told me her back.
I could puncture,

2129
01:34:19,061 --> 01:34:24,061
we'll fix your back and then you have an
infection that will give you the herbs 

2130
01:34:24,061 --> 01:34:24,061
and you'll be fine.
Well,

2131
01:34:24,061 --> 01:34:24,580
infection.
What kind of infection?

2132
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:25,180
Yeah,
no idea.

2133
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:27,520
But he was like,
this stuff will magically,

2134
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,710
whatever it is,
we'll get rid of it real up.

2135
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:33,070
Sure enough because I mean they did at 
Geyser.

2136
01:34:33,071 --> 01:34:38,071
I dad like seven gazillion tests than 
from Mris to rx tool evidencing you name

2137
01:34:39,251 --> 01:34:44,251
it.
They couldn't figure out any stress 

2138
01:34:44,251 --> 01:34:44,251
related for sure.
I mean,

2139
01:34:44,251 --> 01:34:47,750
but stress can cause real stuff.
Not just um,

2140
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,160
psychosomatic psychosomatics really fuck
you up in specific ways.

2141
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:52,360
So I mean,
yeah,

2142
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:53,860
he was thrusted related,
embodied,

2143
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:58,100
like who knows specifically what it is,
nobody figure it out.

2144
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:03,130
And then the crazy Chinese guy safe me 
was telling me about Ufo was the whole 

2145
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:07,181
time.
And that's what I mean about while he 

2146
01:35:07,181 --> 01:35:07,181
was,
while he was fixing it,

2147
01:35:07,181 --> 01:35:08,390
he telling you about your phone still 
worked up,

2148
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:13,400
so thought that.
So that's almost like eliminating the 

2149
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:13,400
placebo effect.
Like,

2150
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:15,050
this guy's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2151
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:20,340
Be talking to me about.
You have those people love the idea of 

2152
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,430
Ufo.
It's a fucking amazing idea for them.

2153
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:23,270
It's fine.
You know,

2154
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:28,330
it's so exciting.
I know that they're out there and that 

2155
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:31,361
they're watching and they're coming in,
they're going to need to know what they 

2156
01:35:31,361 --> 01:35:31,370
are.
Your friends or their key Leo.

2157
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:34,160
Yeah.
I just,

2158
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:35,090
I,
I just,

2159
01:35:35,091 --> 01:35:35,840
um,
I don't,

2160
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:38,870
I'm not saying that they're not real.
Just like,

2161
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,970
I'm not saying that there's not really a
guy in the clouds.

2162
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:44,150
It's just I've not seen anything.

2163
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,000
Anything compelling.
It's possible.

2164
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:47,480
Sure.
I mean,

2165
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:51,830
I leave it open that it would come,
but I'm not seeing anything compelling,

2166
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:53,870
you know,
even the birth of a child.

2167
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:59,410
That's not what we're talking about.
We're talking about Ufo as you fuckhead 

2168
01:35:59,410 --> 01:36:02,550
just tuned out and tune back in.
Took my words completely out of context,

2169
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:06,560
how dare you.
But if the aliens did land,

2170
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,930
that would be.
That'd be the end of everything.

2171
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:11,480
If there was something way smarter than 
us,

2172
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,690
we would just have to give up.
Right?

2173
01:36:14,470 --> 01:36:15,970
We would have to.
We would,

2174
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:20,150
we would be so stunned.
That's when cults were just rise up.

2175
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,950
That's that.
That would be a dark moment.

2176
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:25,610
If it's a real alien culture did come 
here for another planet,

2177
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,800
you know,
people would really get frantic.

2178
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:33,010
That's when people would really like 
some stock stock up on food and 50 

2179
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:33,160
caliber guns and what?

2180
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,650
That's good.
Either way,

2181
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,590
you know,
if you are dealing with something that's

2182
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:41,591
so much more powerful,
so much so it's like you think it's 

2183
01:36:41,591 --> 01:36:46,031
possible for a society to get smart 
enough to be able to travel through 

2184
01:36:46,031 --> 01:36:48,791
space and,
and go and fuck with other people or 

2185
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:48,791
another planet.
I mean,

2186
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:50,070
look at the stuff we do today.
If somebody asked you if he was possible

2187
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:51,800
50 or so ago,
it looks like magic.

2188
01:36:51,801 --> 01:36:56,801
I of this stuff.
But we're always like one fuck up away 

2189
01:36:56,801 --> 01:36:58,340
from blowing each other sky high.
That one doesn't rule.

2190
01:36:58,341 --> 01:37:00,230
The other doesn't overlap with the 
other.

2191
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:05,231
You know,
the fact that you can be incredibly 

2192
01:37:05,231 --> 01:37:07,250
smart and come up with all these awesome
stuff doesn't mean you are wise enough 

2193
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:08,100
to deal with data and not fuck ever seen
God,

2194
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:12,470
which is humanity right there.
That is humanity in a nutshell.

2195
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:17,520
Yeah.
It would be such a fucking shame if we 

2196
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,320
library of Alexandria,
this whole thing.

2197
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:21,470
It just went boom.
Just torch this whole civilization.

2198
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:24,240
And we had to really start from scratch.
Yeah.

2199
01:37:24,241 --> 01:37:26,360
And I would see as little in my day I 
think,

2200
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:29,430
well that is the one sort of.
I'm not,

2201
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:34,450
I don't want to say justification,
but the one sort of argument for having 

2202
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:37,421
one powerful military that dominates the
rest of the world as I go to is that by 

2203
01:37:37,421 --> 01:37:41,351
doing that,
at least they keep everybody else from 

2204
01:37:41,351 --> 01:37:44,350
blowing everything up.
Keep keep your military from growing to 

2205
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:46,760
the point where you were able to make 
the same decisions that we can make.

2206
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,280
We don't want that.
Yeah.

2207
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:53,610
A,
there's an argument and then I guess if 

2208
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:53,660
you look at the statistics,
like what people are like,

2209
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:58,720
you know,
what the potential for people to behave 

2210
01:37:58,720 --> 01:37:58,720
as like,
yeah,

2211
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,070
I'm not a big fan of the US government,
but when I compare it to a lot of,

2212
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:06,130
there are a bunch of places and 
governments that I would like about 

2213
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:06,130
turning.

2214
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:06,130
There are many others.
I'm like,

2215
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,290
Jesus Christ giving me George Bush 
again,

2216
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:11,030
you know,
just give me the worse could happen.

2217
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:16,050
US ever.
And the still I like it better than the 

2218
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:16,050
Taliban,
you know?

2219
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:16,050
Yeah,
no kidding,

2220
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:16,650
right?
Isn't it funny,

2221
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:21,730
you know,
but it's amazing the spectrum of 

2222
01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:24,540
different sorts of regimes that exist at
the same time like what's going on right

2223
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:29,541
now in Syria and while you know the 
Americas are complaining about the 

2224
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:36,590
National Defense Authorization Act,
which takes away a lot of civil 

2225
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:37,611
liberties,
so nothing compared to what the fuck is 

2226
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:40,131
going on in the Middle East and the 
riots of Arabs Arab spring and what's 

2227
01:38:40,131 --> 01:38:42,770
going on right now in Egypt and the,
the power void in Iraq.

2228
01:38:42,771 --> 01:38:47,771
You know,
there's parts of the world right now 

2229
01:38:47,771 --> 01:38:48,990
that are fa a fucked up a lot,
a lot,

2230
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,000
a lot.
I think we as Americans can barely even 

2231
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,000
wrap our heads around that.

2232
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It doesn't even seem real,
of course,

2233
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,290
because unless you leave it,
what the hell?

2234
01:38:55,470 --> 01:39:00,470
Yeah.
That's something you see on tv for 30 

2235
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:00,470
seconds.
That doesn't mean shit.

2236
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:01,470
That's like the one argument for a 
powerful military right there.

2237
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:03,710
Fucking press world,
you know,

2238
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,660
and um,
you know,

2239
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:07,590
people always say that I've,
I've been accused of being a liberal.

2240
01:39:07,591 --> 01:39:09,330
I've been accused of being anti 
military,

2241
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:14,331
which I'm absolutely not.
I'm always anti the people that are 

2242
01:39:14,331 --> 01:39:14,331
pointing the military in certain 
directions.

2243
01:39:14,331 --> 01:39:15,150
Yeah,
that's what I'm anti.

2244
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:17,640
Yeah.
Anti a lot of,

2245
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:20,190
a lot of the people's decisions at the 
very top of the heap.

2246
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:22,920
But as far as like having a military,
yeah.

2247
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:25,300
You better fucking better.
It is.

2248
01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:27,030
It's the rest of the world does.
Yeah.

2249
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:28,830
Yeah.
It's good to have a military.

2250
01:39:28,831 --> 01:39:33,831
It's very good to keep an eye on all 
these crazy assholes all over the world 

2251
01:39:33,831 --> 01:39:35,430
too because yeah,
there's people.

2252
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:40,490
That's the thing.
People then at state good overlap with 

2253
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:41,430
the every single about the commentary is
amazing and wonderful and then when they

2254
01:39:41,431 --> 01:39:45,020
find out that it's not all amazing and 
wonderful that some bad shit happened,

2255
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:50,021
they go to the extreme opposite and it's
like every scene that some Eddy County 

2256
01:39:50,021 --> 01:39:50,021
is horrible,
terrible,

2257
01:39:50,021 --> 01:39:51,810
and the US is responsible for every 
scene that's evil in the world.

2258
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:52,380
It's like,
no,

2259
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,470
that's not the more complicated than 
that.

2260
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,390
It's very complicated.
It's very quickly.

2261
01:39:57,540 --> 01:40:02,540
The economy in and of itself is very 
complicated and a lot of laws that are 

2262
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:05,721
in place are very complicated and one of
the reasons why they're in places 

2263
01:40:05,721 --> 01:40:05,730
because getting rid of laws gets rid of 
jobs.

2264
01:40:05,731 --> 01:40:10,050
We're police officers don't like that.
That's one of the big problems with drug

2265
01:40:10,051 --> 01:40:11,400
enforcement.
You know,

2266
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:13,380
drug enforcement as a,
as a business,

2267
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:18,381
you know the Drug Enforcement Agency,
it's a business drug and forcing is a 

2268
01:40:18,381 --> 01:40:19,500
business that you're spending money,
jobs are created.

2269
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:21,630
This is how ridiculous it gets.
In Florida,

2270
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:24,580
they had people that were pretending to 
be high school students are,

2271
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:26,340
you know the story.
I read it.

2272
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:31,430
I think I tweeted it recently and I mean
there's been more than one case of 

2273
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:32,070
these.
One of them,

2274
01:40:32,071 --> 01:40:37,071
they arrested 28 kids and another one,
this woman was hot and she was 25 and 

2275
01:40:37,071 --> 01:40:41,130
she was flirting with 15 year old boys.
They became facebook friends.

2276
01:40:41,131 --> 01:40:43,350
They were texting each other and she was
flirting with him,

2277
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,690
asking him to get her weed so he got her
weed.

2278
01:40:45,691 --> 01:40:47,940
This poor kid is poor love,
smitten kid.

2279
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:51,000
Got Her weed and he said he didn't even 
want to take money for it.

2280
01:40:51,001 --> 01:40:56,001
He said it was a gift.
She couldn't give him money and then 

2281
01:40:56,001 --> 01:40:56,001
they arrest him and now they're going to
charge him with fucking,

2282
01:40:56,001 --> 01:41:00,900
you know,
a potential nine years in jail or 

2283
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:00,900
something crazy.

2284
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:00,900
You know,
what,

2285
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:04,750
what an asshole thing to do,
what a crazy ridiculous asshole thing to

2286
01:41:04,751 --> 01:41:09,751
do.
And that goes back to that point is 

2287
01:41:09,751 --> 01:41:11,641
like,
why the fuck do people feel the need to 

2288
01:41:11,641 --> 01:41:12,540
tell other people how to live?
You don't like it.

2289
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:14,960
That's what we're talking about.
It's a business that there's a job.

2290
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:17,170
There's jobs that were created in that 
sting,

2291
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:18,620
you know,
they created this thing,

2292
01:41:18,621 --> 01:41:23,621
they went into high school and they got 
kids to sell them weed and they did it 

2293
01:41:23,621 --> 01:41:26,971
in such a sneaky fucked up way.
The fact that a 25 year old woman could 

2294
01:41:26,971 --> 01:41:31,111
ever have a position where she talks a 
boy thing and have that boy responsible 

2295
01:41:32,441 --> 01:41:33,200
for it.
Yeah,

2296
01:41:33,390 --> 01:41:38,390
dude,
a boy and a 15 year old boy has no idea 

2297
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:41,380
what the fuck is going on.
He just sees tents and skin and lips and

2298
01:41:41,381 --> 01:41:46,381
she's touching his hand and his dick is 
hard and he can't even believe she's 

2299
01:41:46,381 --> 01:41:46,381
talking to him.

2300
01:41:46,381 --> 01:41:47,770
He can't even believe she's talking to 
him.

2301
01:41:47,771 --> 01:41:49,990
I'll get you weed.
I'll get you whatever the fuck you want.

2302
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:53,500
He can't believe she's so hot.
She looks like a woman because she has a

2303
01:41:53,501 --> 01:41:56,560
moment that fucking bitches.
Totally cheating.

2304
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:59,720
She's not 15.
She's not a fellow high school student.

2305
01:41:59,721 --> 01:42:02,070
She's a 25 year old cop,
right?

2306
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,810
Assholes.
How ridiculous.

2307
01:42:04,811 --> 01:42:06,430
So that's the thing.
It's like I got it.

2308
01:42:06,431 --> 01:42:08,440
There are jobs in that fight.
I get it,

2309
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:12,310
but unfortunately it's possible to 
figure out a way to like they don't want

2310
01:42:12,311 --> 01:42:14,640
to get shot busting on a meth lab.
He's in there.

2311
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:19,820
Labs are hard to break into.
Isn't there enough real estate to going 

2312
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:21,730
on where people could work to solve real
problems going on?

2313
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:24,730
Yeah.
You would hope you would hope,

2314
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,200
but you know,
I don't.

2315
01:42:26,201 --> 01:42:31,201
I don't think it's that logical.
I think it's a money grab and I think 

2316
01:42:31,201 --> 01:42:34,321
people go where the money is and there 
is money right now in enforcing their 

2317
01:42:34,321 --> 01:42:34,690
current drug laws.

2318
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:37,600
There's a lot of jobs that would be lost
if we just said,

2319
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:38,500
right.
Pot's legal,

2320
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:43,501
sorry.
You know how many fucking people are 

2321
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:43,501
going to be out of jobs?
That's a,

2322
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:43,501
that's a real issue,
you know,

2323
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:44,980
and it's something that should be 
corrected to.

2324
01:42:44,981 --> 01:42:48,280
There should be a bill that addresses 
that as well and says,

2325
01:42:48,281 --> 01:42:53,281
listen,
we're going to replace these drug 

2326
01:42:53,281 --> 01:42:53,281
enforcement jobs with jobs where they're
doing,

2327
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:54,850
you know,
something more,

2328
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:56,560
more,
more helpful,

2329
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,840
you know,
whatever the fuck it is.

2330
01:42:58,870 --> 01:43:01,840
Border Security,
whatever the fuck it is.

2331
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,390
Something.
Something that makes more sense.

2332
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:06,280
Board is courteous,
terrible example,

2333
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:11,370
sure.
Put them in torpedoes or submarines 

2334
01:43:11,370 --> 01:43:13,870
rather get to patrol the ocean.
These are just,

2335
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:15,910
these aren't really well thought out 
ideas,

2336
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:18,580
but if you were trying to come up with a
good bill,

2337
01:43:18,581 --> 01:43:21,490
a good bill would be make marijuana 
legal,

2338
01:43:21,550 --> 01:43:26,550
make it a readily available and sellable
and then take the jobs will be lost and 

2339
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:27,080
Drug Enforcement and put them into 
something positive.

2340
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,140
So whatever it could be forestry,
whatever,

2341
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:32,290
whatever jobs.
But then the issue would be those people

2342
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:33,910
wouldn't be qualified for those jobs.
So how,

2343
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:39,090
how do those people benefit from it are 
those people are just going to be shit 

2344
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:39,090
out of luck?
Not over the whole new career.

2345
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:41,860
Not only jobs that require you to,
you know,

2346
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,180
study for 20 years,
you know,

2347
01:43:43,181 --> 01:43:48,181
I'm sure it could be a period of 
training where they still get money as 

2348
01:43:48,181 --> 01:43:50,620
they are getting trained for the viewer 
in Drug Enforcement for like 25 years,

2349
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,420
which a lot of guys are right.
And then you know,

2350
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:58,720
all of the sudden it's banished,
kinda sucks for them and that's not 

2351
01:43:58,881 --> 01:44:01,070
their fault.
It's not your fault when you a young cop

2352
01:44:01,071 --> 01:44:02,720
and you think that this is a.
well,

2353
01:44:02,721 --> 01:44:03,920
it's the law,
it's what it is,

2354
01:44:03,921 --> 01:44:06,200
but it is.
It's almost not your fault.

2355
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:06,650
You're,
you're,

2356
01:44:06,651 --> 01:44:09,510
you're suckered into doing something 
that's actually a moral.

2357
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:13,130
It just seems like it's okay because 
it's behind the wall,

2358
01:44:13,131 --> 01:44:15,200
have something written down on paper 
somewhere,

2359
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,660
but the reality of it is it's pretty 
fucking a moral.

2360
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:18,560
You know,
when you're,

2361
01:44:18,561 --> 01:44:21,740
when you're locking a kid up in a cage 
because you caught them with some plants

2362
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:24,500
or some fungus.
That's absolutely an APP.

2363
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:30,090
It's reprehensible and everyone knows 
that inherently they know it inside and 

2364
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:30,470
if you don't,
you're fooling yourself.

2365
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:33,640
It's really that simple.
It's just,

2366
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:38,810
it's just,
it's amazing that we still have to have 

2367
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:41,051
these conversations and not only that we
can do because if you look at the 

2368
01:44:41,051 --> 01:44:41,051
political scene,
nobody,

2369
01:44:41,051 --> 01:44:42,860
not Republicans,
not Democrats.

2370
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:45,370
I mean not.
Nobody was a shot at winning,

2371
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:50,380
let's put it that way.
I would even bring up these topics 

2372
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:50,380
because it's political suicide,
you know,

2373
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:51,710
he's like,
you are soft on their ad.

2374
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:54,630
You really want the roads to be shooting
anyway.

2375
01:44:54,631 --> 01:44:56,960
No,
it's like the problem is those dangerous

2376
01:44:56,961 --> 01:44:57,560
drugs,
man,

2377
01:44:57,570 --> 01:45:02,570
those problems,
those drugs that fucking socked and we 

2378
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:03,600
need to like really get it out there to 
kids like don't fuck with heroin.

2379
01:45:03,601 --> 01:45:08,601
I don't fuck with math,
don't fuck with all these dangerous 

2380
01:45:08,601 --> 01:45:08,601
ones.
You know,

2381
01:45:08,601 --> 01:45:08,900
there's a lot of debt.
And if,

2382
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:11,600
if things were legal,
like if cocaine was legal,

2383
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:16,630
you would actually buy real cocaine.
He would go to a pharmacy or whatever 

2384
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:19,070
the fuck you would buy it if it was 
legal and goodbye real cocaine,

2385
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:21,470
you know,
you're not getting real cocaine.

2386
01:45:21,471 --> 01:45:24,890
Now you're getting real cocaine that 
joey has bought and chopped up and you,

2387
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:29,920
you know what I mean?
Who knows what you're getting of Myrica 

2388
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:29,920
Matt,
uh,

2389
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,400
Albert Hoffman,
the guy who will create the less day.

2390
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,740
And one of the things that you 
established me was,

2391
01:45:33,741 --> 01:45:34,230
uh,
you know,

2392
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:39,360
most of the stuff that goes for lsd 
around the word is not a name because 

2393
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:39,770
the stuff that,
the way I make,

2394
01:45:39,771 --> 01:45:44,771
it uses certain compounds that are so 
rare that there's no way that he could 

2395
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:45,850
support such mantra production.

2396
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:47,630
They're just teasing them up over that 
stuff.

2397
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:50,090
Wow.
You say whatever they sell out there,

2398
01:45:50,091 --> 01:45:51,740
it's.
I have no idea what the holidays,

2399
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:55,220
but he's served on these now my stuff 
and he argue a dang.

2400
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:56,520
Who knows?
Maybe it's through a window,

2401
01:45:56,810 --> 01:46:00,770
but he argued at ea staff would give you
kind of hold the benefits of lsd without

2402
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:05,771
all the crap from St Louis.
And I'm so treat us to lsd though,

2403
01:46:05,931 --> 01:46:10,931
is still giving you the same benefits as
the stuff that he produces was just 

2404
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:10,931
wasn't as taxing on the body.
Yeah,

2405
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:12,590
yeah,
yeah.

2406
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:15,890
They made that shit illegal too,
too much.

2407
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:20,950
She goes,
actually you see these guys like a 

2408
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:22,860
Suisse cammies to sylvere was all doing 
very now he's been dead for awhile.

2409
01:46:22,930 --> 01:46:24,320
But uh,
he's uh,

2410
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,800
and he was originally looking for a cure
for headache.

2411
01:46:28,030 --> 01:46:31,230
Like he was working on a headache pill 
and he came up with LSD.

2412
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:36,920
That was pretty fun to come up with it 
and not even realize it took it 

2413
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:40,720
accidentally.
Got It in his skin and it was riding 

2414
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:40,720
home on his bike and just tripping his 
fucking balls off.

2415
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,050
Yeah.
Not knowing what he did,

2416
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:46,910
they had no idea what the dosage was 
back then because lsd like the,

2417
01:46:46,911 --> 01:46:51,911
the dosage to body ratio has been 
compared to an ant demolishing the 

2418
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:57,410
empire state building in 30 seconds.
Like literally like that's how powerful 

2419
01:46:58,091 --> 01:47:01,530
like a little tiny drop of this shit is.
He didn't know that man.

2420
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:04,050
He probably was drinking glasses of it 
though.

2421
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:10,120
Acid shots,
shots of acid.

2422
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:12,570
Oh my God.
But I did that.

2423
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:17,590
I met the guy.
He say sat Sunday seem perfectly 

2424
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:17,820
coherent and logical steel and all of 
that.

2425
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:19,400
So who knows?
Maybe it was right.

2426
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:24,530
There's a different look that those old 
guys that have done acid having their 

2427
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:24,530
eyes.

2428
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:26,580
It is a different look.
You know,

2429
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:27,450
they,
there's a,

2430
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:32,540
there's a weird thing that you get 
sometimes we're talking to one of those 

2431
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:35,481
old asset dudes.
You might've seen some shit that's not 

2432
01:47:35,481 --> 01:47:35,810
available anymore.
You know,

2433
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:39,300
they might have seen some limited 
production view of life.

2434
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:44,301
Threw acid that acid in the sixties.
I would've loved to have seen what it 

2435
01:47:44,301 --> 01:47:45,420
was like,
like the flower child,

2436
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:48,120
children of the San Francisco,
early 19 sixties.

2437
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:53,510
You know,
I watched that a hunter s Thompson 

2438
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:55,821
documentary,
a Gonzo the life and times I'm doctor 

2439
01:47:55,821 --> 01:47:59,790
and it's a fucking fun documentary,
but one of the things that talks about 

2440
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:03,441
what's the utopia of the asset culture,
the early 19 sixties and San Francisco 

2441
01:48:03,441 --> 01:48:05,730
and they show all these people running 
around holding hands together,

2442
01:48:05,731 --> 01:48:09,030
tripping their balls off,
and it's really interesting,

2443
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:10,890
man.
Like that was a,

2444
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:13,500
that whole fucking part of the world.

2445
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:18,680
It wasn't illegal yet and that whole 
part of the world was just blossoming 

2446
01:48:18,751 --> 01:48:23,751
with all these new ideas and new music 
and this new sort of wild psychedelic 

2447
01:48:24,031 --> 01:48:29,031
culture was all like emanating out of 
this one place and they fucking threw 

2448
01:48:29,031 --> 01:48:29,320
the water on it and squash that shit.
Yeah,

2449
01:48:29,410 --> 01:48:31,710
it's amazing if you,
if you just list them to the music alone

2450
01:48:31,711 --> 01:48:36,711
and you asked them to what was in the 19
fifties and then you switched to a six 

2451
01:48:36,711 --> 01:48:36,711
days was like,
what the hell just happened?

2452
01:48:36,711 --> 01:48:41,601
He's like,
he's a whole other universe right there 

2453
01:48:41,601 --> 01:48:41,601
as.
Yeah,

2454
01:48:41,601 --> 01:48:44,661
they,
they came up with some fucking 

2455
01:48:44,661 --> 01:48:44,700
incredible shit and that makes it all 
happened.

2456
01:48:44,701 --> 01:48:46,950
I mean,
a lot of it all happened in that area of

2457
01:48:46,951 --> 01:48:48,370
San Francisco,
you know,

2458
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:51,240
it's a widow.
Was there a moment in time,

2459
01:48:51,241 --> 01:48:53,610
man,
where if time travel is impossible,

2460
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:57,240
but time recreationists they ever 
figured out a way to to recruit,

2461
01:48:57,241 --> 01:49:02,241
like we could just go in and peek that 
we know like remember those things that 

2462
01:49:02,241 --> 01:49:05,901
you had when you were a kid,
the view sliders and it was like a 

2463
01:49:05,901 --> 01:49:06,990
dinosaur and you would click click and 
it will be the next dinosaur.

2464
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:12,590
If there was something you could put on 
some goggles and just take a view as to 

2465
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:15,270
what life was like in a certain area.
You know,

2466
01:49:15,271 --> 01:49:20,271
$5 million years ago,
be like a fucking a security camera on 

2467
01:49:20,271 --> 01:49:24,441
the wall 100 million years ago in the 
jungle and watched dinosaurs rundown 

2468
01:49:24,441 --> 01:49:29,151
Jack and things.
I wonder if that will be eventually 

2469
01:49:29,151 --> 01:49:29,830
possible.
I wouldn't it if you.

2470
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:34,020
Maybe you can't have travel back in time
that you can have a view get.

2471
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:39,120
That's where even if they just had some 
amazing computer simulation of what had 

2472
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:41,530
happened.
I think I'm good with.

2473
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:44,040
Yeah,
what the fuck.

2474
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:48,040
We're lucky,
we're very lucky we were living in

2475
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:53,040
2012.
We would have been dead at any other 

2476
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:53,650
time in history where two week we 
wouldn't have been able to deal with the

2477
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:58,800
caveman era or the Babylonian Empire or 
the Sumerian days when was coming.

2478
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:01,800
That's supposed to take place.
I mean,

2479
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,160
it's funny because he actually have to 
use us a lot of history,

2480
01:50:04,161 --> 01:50:05,960
but then he argues that,
you know,

2481
01:50:05,990 --> 01:50:09,350
he makes up a lot of graph of course 
history.

2482
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,930
Robert e Dot Howard did like what?
What did he use a lot?

2483
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:16,940
If you look at these maps,
they are based on many of the cultures 

2484
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:21,581
see nice sort of fantasy wall or dire 
based then on cultures that eventually 

2485
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:22,970
evolve in a real historical times that 
we know of,

2486
01:50:22,971 --> 01:50:24,980
but he supposed to predate all this 
stuff.

2487
01:50:24,981 --> 01:50:28,310
We know.
So he argues that there was Atlantis and

2488
01:50:28,311 --> 01:50:33,311
it's super powerful.
It's utilization and that collapsed and 

2489
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:36,131
the ward went into this hardcore 
barbarianism and then civilizations who 

2490
01:50:36,131 --> 01:50:39,601
are rising up again and that's when 
Conan set scene and then the history we 

2491
01:50:39,601 --> 01:50:40,130
know of that comes down the road.

2492
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:45,850
So is it so appealing for men?
I mean the guy goes around chopping 

2493
01:50:45,981 --> 01:50:48,500
people set off,
grabbing all of the most beautiful women

2494
01:50:48,501 --> 01:50:49,420
in the land.
I mean,

2495
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:51,530
do I need to go on?
He drinks all the time.

2496
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:52,700
Yeah.
But the,

2497
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,470
that era like that,
that the,

2498
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,560
that,
that,

2499
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:58,570
not that arrow rather,
but that genre,

2500
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:03,780
the,
the sorcery and the snakes and the 

2501
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:04,450
monsters,
he's always fighting and you know,

2502
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:07,070
Conan had the coolest fucking stories.
Like what is it?

2503
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:11,650
I mean literally essentially taps into 
them young male fantasy.

2504
01:51:11,870 --> 01:51:13,600
Especially the,
as you become older,

2505
01:51:13,601 --> 01:51:15,160
you're supposed to.
I'm in my forties,

2506
01:51:15,161 --> 01:51:17,020
I'm so drop that,
you know,

2507
01:51:17,021 --> 01:51:20,410
I'm not supposed to be like into like 
the next cone and movie.

2508
01:51:20,411 --> 01:51:22,390
Like someone get it right.
Like that's ridiculous.

2509
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:26,020
I'm a father and as a grown man and I'm 
in the Conan,

2510
01:51:26,021 --> 01:51:29,050
the barbarian cares,
it becomes,

2511
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:30,280
there was,
it's a,

2512
01:51:30,281 --> 01:51:35,281
it is,
it taps into like a real curse 

2513
01:51:35,281 --> 01:51:37,240
adolescent childhood sort of fantasy 
genre thing in our heads.

2514
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:38,900
I mean,
who doesn't want to.

2515
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:41,370
What was in the movie?
What's the best thing?

2516
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:46,380
Life Corner,
your enemies have been before you hear 

2517
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,450
the limitations of women.
Is that,

2518
01:51:49,451 --> 01:51:53,120
what is the limitation lamp?
I used to say lamination.

2519
01:51:56,030 --> 01:51:56,650
You know,
it's funny,

2520
01:51:56,651 --> 01:52:01,651
I actually grew up,
I watched Conan a million times in 

2521
01:52:01,651 --> 01:52:02,800
Italian and so I never really heard it 
in,

2522
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:04,270
in English.
And when I heard,

2523
01:52:04,271 --> 01:52:05,740
uh,
our note speaking it,

2524
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:06,730
I was like,
oh Jesus,

2525
01:52:06,731 --> 01:52:08,880
this is a whole completely different 
movie watching kids.

2526
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:11,200
At least that was the original voice.
Like,

2527
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:12,160
Hey,
come here.

2528
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,470
No,
it wasn't just these mentally tough guy,

2529
01:52:14,471 --> 01:52:19,471
but nothing particular,
no one ever gets it right when they do 

2530
01:52:19,511 --> 01:52:22,990
like a voiceover,
they hardly ever get it right that time.

2531
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:25,210
Maybe because I at least include that 
one first.

2532
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:26,380
I was like,
Oh God,

2533
01:52:26,381 --> 01:52:27,630
they English.
Arson sucks.

2534
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:29,020
It's painful.
It really.

2535
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:31,630
So the English version would arnold who 
wasn't as good.

2536
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:33,340
How dare you.
Because it makes you laugh.

2537
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:37,360
His voice,
especially when you don't expect it,

2538
01:52:37,361 --> 01:52:42,361
because I was used to seeing Conan 
speaking like a regular human being and 

2539
01:52:42,361 --> 01:52:45,660
I'm saying he might have went with a,
could accent his accent.

2540
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:47,830
Listen to you,
but my accent is great.

2541
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:51,770
Will your accent has a certain amount of
classical flair to it?

2542
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:53,950
The Italian accent.
It's go to the garden.

2543
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:57,460
A role to the tongue.
Say Right.

2544
01:52:57,770 --> 01:53:00,230
Welcome to the olive garden.
Welcome to the olive garden.

2545
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:03,150
He's gonna.
Use that for video now.

2546
01:53:03,151 --> 01:53:05,150
That's my new ring tone.
Fluxion weird.

2547
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:09,110
A love affair with the olive garden.
It's his religion.

2548
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:14,150
He didn't go with Judaism.
Somebody tweeted me yesterday that I was

2549
01:53:14,151 --> 01:53:16,700
supposed to tell him that I saw him at 
the olive garden.

2550
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:21,050
Weird,
stupid running joke.

2551
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:24,650
It will go on forever too.
He will not let it go,

2552
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:25,970
but the strangest thing you've ever 
seen.

2553
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:29,240
Picking up people to 18 and stuff.
I wanted to mention.

2554
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:34,330
Your fans are fucking awesome.
I've never been around people who are 

2555
01:53:34,330 --> 01:53:38,501
like.
After the first podcast I got to meet 

2556
01:53:38,501 --> 01:53:40,720
different people on facebook now I 
started at twitter and stuff and you 

2557
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:43,400
know every single person I've run into 
as been really smart,

2558
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:45,380
really nice,
super polite,

2559
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:50,410
but you check out their pages and they 
are all live like really interesting 

2560
01:53:50,410 --> 01:53:50,960
people.
We are funny man.

2561
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:52,130
So I was like,
man,

2562
01:53:52,131 --> 01:53:54,140
I'm happy that there are people like 
that out there,

2563
01:53:54,141 --> 01:53:55,550
you know,
I think if you

2564
01:53:57,090 --> 01:53:59,940
that sort of that sort of a show,
you know,

2565
01:53:59,941 --> 01:54:02,880
you put all that kind of um,
that kind of a vibe and have people like

2566
01:54:02,881 --> 01:54:07,881
you come on the show and you know,
other people that have had that people 

2567
01:54:07,881 --> 01:54:10,461
have really reacted to like Graham 
Hancock and I got this Sam Harris 

2568
01:54:10,461 --> 01:54:10,770
County.
It's coming on soon and you know,

2569
01:54:10,771 --> 01:54:14,580
having like really intelligent,
interesting people on the show it and,

2570
01:54:14,670 --> 01:54:15,840
and,
and putting out,

2571
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:17,130
do you know,
your own,

2572
01:54:17,131 --> 01:54:19,510
your personal philosophy on things.
You know,

2573
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:21,420
so people just fucking be nice to 
people.

2574
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:24,180
Stop being content to each other.
Everybody can be cool.

2575
01:54:24,181 --> 01:54:29,181
Everybody should be generous.
Like surrounding yourself with a bunch 

2576
01:54:29,181 --> 01:54:29,580
of people that you really like and 
don't,

2577
01:54:29,581 --> 01:54:34,581
don't tolerate any bullshit and 
negativity from removed that shit from 

2578
01:54:34,581 --> 01:54:35,280
your life.
Remove that shift from what you're doing

2579
01:54:35,281 --> 01:54:40,281
for a living.
Push yourself in the direction that you 

2580
01:54:40,281 --> 01:54:40,281
actually want to go in.

2581
01:54:40,281 --> 01:54:40,281
And you know,
when you put that out there,

2582
01:54:40,281 --> 01:54:44,930
people respond to it and they start.
It starts to become a part of their 

2583
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:49,011
vibration,
starts to become a part of who they are 

2584
01:54:49,011 --> 01:54:49,011
as a person.
You know,

2585
01:54:49,011 --> 01:54:52,670
and I think that's what's happened.
We have like this crazy group of people 

2586
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:53,240
that are super cool,
you know,

2587
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:53,850
I mean,
it's,

2588
01:54:53,910 --> 01:54:58,910
I'm not delusional about this.
It sounds completely ridiculous that I 

2589
01:54:58,910 --> 01:54:58,910
would even say,
well,

2590
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:02,910
there's a reason why my crowd's cool,
but if you go to my shows,

2591
01:55:02,911 --> 01:55:06,450
the waitresses are always saying that,
that he was so nice and that they're so.

2592
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,850
They're so generous.
I think it's just,

2593
01:55:08,851 --> 01:55:09,810
you put that out there,
man.

2594
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:11,580
I think it's good for all of us,
man.

2595
01:55:11,581 --> 01:55:13,230
Like I didn't figure this out all on my 
own.

2596
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:15,780
I had to meet a bunch of people that 
started behaving like this.

2597
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:17,790
I had to meet people that had their shit
together,

2598
01:55:17,791 --> 01:55:22,791
that impressed me,
that we're nice and were positive and 

2599
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:23,000
that impacted me.
And I learned from the way they behaved.

2600
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:23,880
You know,
I think,

2601
01:55:24,090 --> 01:55:29,090
I think we're all doing that for each 
other and these conversations and you 

2602
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:29,090
know,
these,

2603
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:30,450
these subjects that we're having these 
know these subjects are,

2604
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,700
you know,
it's unusual that you would have,

2605
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:37,880
you know,
someone who knows as much religion in 

2606
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:38,460
your life to as you do to sit down with 
and,

2607
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:39,020
and,
and,

2608
01:55:39,021 --> 01:55:40,660
and go over this kind of stuff.
Right.

2609
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,960
There's not a lot of opportunities that 
people have to,

2610
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:48,290
to a lot of big group of cool people.
It's one of the best things about this 

2611
01:55:48,290 --> 01:55:48,390
podcast.
It makes me happy because,

2612
01:55:48,391 --> 01:55:50,400
you know,
I'm a judgmental little bastard so I see

2613
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:51,970
a lot of people where I'm like,
Eh,

2614
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:53,640
I don't like you so much.

2615
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:55,410
And all of that.
So for me to say,

2616
01:55:55,470 --> 01:56:00,470
Jesus,
I'm blown away by the quality of people 

2617
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:02,991
that are running into after that nurse 
just I'm not a wine was always like,

2618
01:56:03,650 --> 01:56:08,650
you know,
everything goody goody evidencing is 

2619
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:09,030
great and one and fire from Athens.
So I was really mad.

2620
01:56:09,031 --> 01:56:14,031
I,
it's hard to keep track of so many good 

2621
01:56:14,031 --> 01:56:14,580
conversation with some people that will 
touch base with me after that.

2622
01:56:14,581 --> 01:56:16,920
I was really,
really impressed with it,

2623
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:17,850
so that's awesome,
man.

2624
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:18,870
Yeah.
Like I said,

2625
01:56:18,871 --> 01:56:23,871
I think you can put that out there man,
but then out there it's what you're 

2626
01:56:23,871 --> 01:56:23,871
going to get back.
You know,

2627
01:56:23,871 --> 01:56:25,350
when you,
when you put out there in the universe.

2628
01:56:25,351 --> 01:56:28,020
It sounds completely corny and hippie 
and ridiculous,

2629
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:31,200
but I think the EU,
we all,

2630
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:36,201
we,
we all can do with like sort of 

2631
01:56:36,201 --> 01:56:39,540
absorbing a good community.
We all could do that at the Internet and

2632
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:44,541
I think that's one of the big powers 
that the Internet gives us is it gives 

2633
01:56:44,761 --> 01:56:46,340
us the ability to form communities.

2634
01:56:46,350 --> 01:56:50,190
It gives us the ability to choose who 
you associate with and,

2635
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,130
and you know,
and connect to people in a way that it's

2636
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:55,830
never really been possible before 
because that's the funny thing.

2637
01:56:55,831 --> 01:57:00,831
You probably get the message from the 
guy in Iceland somewhere where he's like

2638
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:04,050
the weird guy in the village and 
everybody else is looking at him like,

2639
01:57:04,051 --> 01:57:09,051
what's your problem?
And now he has a chance to realize shit 

2640
01:57:09,051 --> 01:57:11,781
that are other people out there.
You can see the water the way I do and 

2641
01:57:11,781 --> 01:57:15,500
the message board and on twitter,
and there's always people from people 

2642
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:19,401
from Norway and Sweden and Iceland and 
all throughout Europe and all 

2643
01:57:19,401 --> 01:57:21,210
throughout.
I've have people that post from China,

2644
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:23,140
from islands,
you know,

2645
01:57:23,190 --> 01:57:24,150
it's amazing.
You know,

2646
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:25,550
it's uh,
the,

2647
01:57:25,610 --> 01:57:27,060
the idea of twitter,
you know,

2648
01:57:27,061 --> 01:57:27,900
the idea of,
you know,

2649
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:30,440
anybody from anywhere in the world.

2650
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:35,440
It's like sinking up through this thing 
and then there's going to be something 

2651
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:38,841
after that it was going to be,
they're going to figure out some next 

2652
01:57:38,841 --> 01:57:38,841
step after twitter where things are 
going to get really strange.

2653
01:57:38,841 --> 01:57:43,731
I hope for a while they come back,
their name considerably just took me 

2654
01:57:43,731 --> 01:57:46,641
forever to get on twitter because it was
like really do I want to get something 

2655
01:57:46,641 --> 01:57:50,010
called with dirt and it's like Jesus 
Christ to have some self respect there.

2656
01:57:50,011 --> 01:57:50,630
Come on,
you know,

2657
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:55,650
it sounds ridiculous.
They should have called the corner and 

2658
01:57:55,650 --> 01:57:55,650
then I would have to respect that.
It's.

2659
01:57:55,650 --> 01:57:58,310
That would've been cool.
Today's episode is called Conan.

2660
01:57:58,320 --> 01:57:59,140
Yeah,
exactly.

2661
01:57:59,170 --> 01:58:02,160
We got a little silly today with Colin 
and I think we might have over Conan,

2662
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:05,520
Conan enthusiast get together.
Sparks fly.

2663
01:58:05,570 --> 01:58:06,210
Yeah,
that's what it is.

2664
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,850
You ever read any Robert e Dot Howard 
and you were a boy?

2665
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:10,380
Uh,
I read the comic.

2666
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,630
I didn't read the books or anything,
man.

2667
01:58:12,631 --> 01:58:14,340
You gotta you gotta get the books to 
this day.

2668
01:58:14,341 --> 01:58:16,560
You'll enjoy it if you're not going to 
read a book.

2669
01:58:16,561 --> 01:58:18,660
Why am I even saying that to you?
When was the last time you read a book?

2670
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:24,170
I'm actually recently,
it started to re reading the Steve Jobs 

2671
01:58:24,170 --> 01:58:24,170
books,
but I never finished.

2672
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:28,530
You like to read biographies?
You read like Steve Martin's,

2673
01:58:28,531 --> 01:58:29,260
right?
Oh yeah.

2674
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:31,560
Also what is a,
what did it say?

2675
01:58:31,561 --> 01:58:34,710
Well,
Steve Jobs was he do shit.

2676
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:35,970
I didn't finish it.
I like,

2677
01:58:35,971 --> 01:58:37,620
it was just kind of going through his,
his,

2678
01:58:37,870 --> 01:58:38,940
his,
you know,

2679
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:43,870
everything.
So is stuff I already knew stuff for the

2680
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:46,170
most part,
but there's a guy,

2681
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:51,610
he sort of formed a little cult,
our cult of technology and fucking 

2682
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:54,610
slick.
I got Gazal Fuck fanboy I used to.

2683
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:55,930
I was a fucking fat boy.

2684
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:59,770
Did you hear about the Steve Jobs and 
watch his little speeches and shit?

2685
01:58:59,771 --> 01:59:01,720
We would bring out new laptops.
So dumb.

2686
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,990
Did you go with the controversy about 
the Steve Jobs Doll?

2687
01:59:05,020 --> 01:59:05,740
No,
I haven't.

2688
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:10,770
There's this steve jobs doll that was 
made and I think China and it looks so 

2689
01:59:10,770 --> 01:59:13,270
realistic and it comes with like all 
these like little things like,

2690
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:15,430
hey,
this is for presentation so you can kind

2691
01:59:15,431 --> 01:59:20,431
of play doll with them.
But apple was like a cease and desist 

2692
01:59:20,431 --> 01:59:22,030
and so now it's like calling it a steve 
jobs doll.

2693
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:22,710
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2694
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:24,220
I'll show you a picture.
It's scary.

2695
01:59:24,370 --> 01:59:26,720
It's really scary because it looks just 
like them.

2696
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:30,220
What if Steve Jobs dolls became the new 
crucifix?

2697
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:34,120
People who are fucking crucifix come 
about.

2698
01:59:34,121 --> 01:59:34,480
How did they.

2699
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:39,650
Well,
how do they start carrying around the 

2700
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:39,650
one thing that killed Jesus.
That's what an unlikely choice.

2701
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:42,660
Speaking of which can you imagine?
Because up until not that long before,

2702
01:59:42,661 --> 01:59:47,661
one of the choice for more of that 
penalty was as a people being bailed out

2703
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:48,930
budget,
but not always the case.

2704
01:59:48,931 --> 01:59:53,830
People would have hanging out there with
bikes to get to a guy sas and that.

2705
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:54,940
That would be good.
So,

2706
01:59:54,941 --> 01:59:59,941
uh,
the originator or the original story 

2707
01:59:59,941 --> 02:00:01,110
that draco was based on Vlad the impaler
Baylor.

2708
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:03,240
Yes.
He used to eat his lunch and they,

2709
02:00:03,241 --> 02:00:04,400
there's photos of him.
Well,

2710
02:00:04,401 --> 02:00:09,401
not photos of them.
Obviously the drawings rather have him 

2711
02:00:09,401 --> 02:00:13,881
sitting at a banquet table while these 
people are on spikes writhing around 

2712
02:00:14,191 --> 02:00:16,080
him.
And that's how you eat his dinner,

2713
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:17,350
pick it up.
[inaudible],

2714
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:19,830
see Cedar liquidity badges.
Somebody thinking,

2715
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:21,690
let me figure out and I can shop.

2716
02:00:21,690 --> 02:00:25,410
And these giant Paula somebody says,
but missing all the internal organs.

2717
02:00:25,411 --> 02:00:27,570
So I don't kill them.
And then they get slowly.

2718
02:00:27,630 --> 02:00:29,040
It's like,
oh my God,

2719
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:33,180
think of that horrible man.
Just what a terrible way to die.

2720
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:36,870
Jesus Christ.
It's hard to even wrap your head on.

2721
02:00:36,871 --> 02:00:39,000
And it took a long time for those people
that die.

2722
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:41,160
It took a long time.
That was the goal.

2723
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:43,770
She's fucking.
Yeah.

2724
02:00:43,771 --> 02:00:48,030
And apparently the vlad the impaler 
story was a guy,

2725
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:50,020
he was particularly ruthless.
And one of the things,

2726
02:00:50,021 --> 02:00:52,050
because he was out numbered.
So he,

2727
02:00:52,051 --> 02:00:55,470
uh,
set up a lot of these bodies outside the

2728
02:00:55,471 --> 02:01:00,471
perimeter of his town just to scare the 
fuck anybody would come near and it was 

2729
02:01:00,471 --> 02:01:03,300
more like he was,
he was like back up against the wall and

2730
02:01:03,301 --> 02:01:05,470
had to take some crazy chances.
Right.

2731
02:01:05,610 --> 02:01:09,190
And yeah,
I mean he became started right into it.

2732
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:10,350
Yeah.
You imagine that man,

2733
02:01:10,351 --> 02:01:15,351
they,
they make a fucking monster movie about 

2734
02:01:15,351 --> 02:01:15,770
you hundreds of years after you're dead.
What it impact you had.

2735
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:20,800
Yeah.
That's when you know you're bad ass 

2736
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:20,800
crazy asshole.
Yeah.

2737
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:20,800
Seriously.
But yeah.

2738
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,770
Can you imagine if that wasn't instead 
of punishment in Jesus' times.

2739
02:01:22,771 --> 02:01:24,360
Now Christians today are the dirt and 
just,

2740
02:01:24,361 --> 02:01:25,950
you know,
all themselves and stuff.

2741
02:01:25,951 --> 02:01:27,280
You'll just me,
me,

2742
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:33,260
me make mimic the pole up the,
that would be the thing you would do 

2743
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:35,100
instead of the cross.
Oh my God.

2744
02:01:35,101 --> 02:01:36,300
People Enter Church Avenue.

2745
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:38,040
Oh,
could you imagine?

2746
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:40,550
Oh that be so ridiculous.

2747
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:46,300
I mean,
it's just as ridiculous as nailing 

2748
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:46,300
yourself to the fucking car.
I mean,

2749
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:47,410
what do you do when you're making the 
points of the cross the cross?

2750
02:01:47,411 --> 02:01:49,130
I mean,
it's such a bizarre symbol.

2751
02:01:49,131 --> 02:01:50,660
Lenny Bruce said it best,
he's like,

2752
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:52,160
he's like,
100 years from now.

2753
02:01:52,161 --> 02:01:57,161
It's like people walking around with the
electric chairs around their neck and 

2754
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:59,120
fucked up the junk.
I forgot how he said it.

2755
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:01,280
I forget.
I forget exact wording.

2756
02:02:01,281 --> 02:02:06,281
And then Bill Hicks had another one.
It's like a really variation on that 

2757
02:02:06,281 --> 02:02:06,860
joke.
He said it was like a Jackie Onassis and

2758
02:02:06,861 --> 02:02:10,700
walking up to her whether with a rifle 
pendant on thinking about John,

2759
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:13,370
you know,
really kind of on the same job,

2760
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:17,480
but it really is true.
They killed him on that thing and people

2761
02:02:17,481 --> 02:02:19,460
carried around.
How'd that tradition gets started?

2762
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:21,970
Fuck.
Oh,

2763
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:23,900
do much way to our different.
I don't remember.

2764
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:28,900
You don't remember?
You don't remember how that tradition 

2765
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:28,900
got started?
How they started mailing?

2766
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:30,230
No.
And they link people to the cross.

2767
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,750
You got high before the show didn't you 
know?

2768
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:36,610
We got a little too high in and out.
It's rocket fuel son.

2769
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:37,910
That's high grade.
It's not.

2770
02:02:37,911 --> 02:02:39,020
It's problematic.
It's a wave.

2771
02:02:39,021 --> 02:02:44,021
Sometimes you know,
it crushes you onto it and then you got 

2772
02:02:44,021 --> 02:02:44,021
to get back up on your board.
Happy.

2773
02:02:44,021 --> 02:02:45,080
Anyway.
So it doesn't really matter some moments

2774
02:02:45,081 --> 02:02:50,081
I'm on and that makes sense,
like failing similarity in as long as 

2775
02:02:50,121 --> 02:02:51,590
you're happy,
I'm happy.

2776
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:53,900
But.
So how did they,

2777
02:02:53,901 --> 02:02:54,260
uh,
W,

2778
02:02:54,261 --> 02:02:59,261
W,
why do people start carrying around the 

2779
02:02:59,261 --> 02:02:59,261
cross?
It was one off.

2780
02:02:59,261 --> 02:03:02,590
Does a punishments like impaling people.
The idea was how can we make you 

2781
02:03:02,590 --> 02:03:07,560
suffered reward in a very public way 
where people go by and they will see you

2782
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:11,210
slowly dying there for three days and 
uh,

2783
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:15,500
it goes back to this desire of rulers in
17 states and the Roman sweater,

2784
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:20,800
perfect example of these guys,
but they weren't the only ones doing 

2785
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:20,800
that tool.

2786
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:23,950
Got into it because he was a way to make
a statement which is don't fuck with us 

2787
02:03:23,950 --> 02:03:27,110
because if you ever even think of 
rebelling against us,

2788
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:32,130
this is what's going to happen to you.
And every time you go down the street 

2789
02:03:32,130 --> 02:03:32,360
you see somebody there and think about 
you being there.

2790
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:35,230
You might want to think about that plan.
Offer a value on that.

2791
02:03:35,231 --> 02:03:37,280
You how often when they crucifying 
people,

2792
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:40,820
and I mean you don't have to do it that 
often to have an impact on people.

2793
02:03:40,821 --> 02:03:45,821
I don't think you need to see that many 
people crucified for it to stay in your 

2794
02:03:45,821 --> 02:03:45,821
head,
but,

2795
02:03:45,821 --> 02:03:47,760
but you had cases like when the spiral 
psychosis,

2796
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:51,980
where after the rebellion they grabbed 
like thousands of slaves and nailed them

2797
02:03:51,981 --> 02:03:56,330
one every so many hundred feet between 
Naples and Rome.

2798
02:03:56,450 --> 02:04:01,450
That's a long fucking high and the 
entire way people on Colossus or oh my 

2799
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:04,580
God,
Holy Shit.

2800
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:05,540
It's hard.
Hardcore.

2801
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:13,520
That is terrifying.
And now how the fuck do people go from 

2802
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:14,340
that to wearing one around your chain 
diamonds?

2803
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:18,620
How did she go from one P diddy?
You know,

2804
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:20,650
big ass bling,
bling crosses.

2805
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:25,680
So Jesus is up.
That's what I love about 80 scrape 

2806
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:26,100
shirts.
You know,

2807
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:31,690
like Jesus don't like him,
but the guy was very hardcore about 

2808
02:04:31,690 --> 02:04:31,690
economics.
You know,

2809
02:04:31,690 --> 02:04:36,221
one of the things he says is a easier 
for a camel to go through the eye of a 

2810
02:04:36,221 --> 02:04:37,500
needle than for a rich man to get into 
heaven.

2811
02:04:37,690 --> 02:04:38,310
Wow.

2812
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:41,140
Karl Marx doesn't go that far.
You know what I mean,

2813
02:04:41,810 --> 02:04:46,810
it's like easier for a camel to go 
through the eye of a needle than for a 

2814
02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:51,471
rich man to get into heaven.
God Damn Jesus was dropping some poor 

2815
02:04:51,471 --> 02:04:51,800
man's science.
So,

2816
02:04:51,810 --> 02:04:56,810
I mean he is probably a bit in that.
It's probably totally a bit in the 

2817
02:04:56,810 --> 02:04:57,180
crosses.
So explain to me again,

2818
02:04:57,730 --> 02:04:59,820
I'm going to write this down.
Where did the crosses,

2819
02:04:59,821 --> 02:05:04,821
how far did they last from old people?
Piss Shit.

2820
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:10,220
He wasn't Jewish.
Time is definitely money was emerged as 

2821
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:11,450
well,
I want to say started in Burger but,

2822
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,530
but the um,
the people that were a pinned off in the

2823
02:05:16,531 --> 02:05:17,740
cross,
the,

2824
02:05:17,870 --> 02:05:18,610
you know,
the,

2825
02:05:19,070 --> 02:05:21,240
the road that you were talking about,
there was 1000.

2826
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:23,520
How many feet was it where people were 
on the cross?

2827
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:28,560
He was between Naples and Rome.
And how far as the economic center later

2828
02:05:29,370 --> 02:05:29,870
in April.

2829
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:35,410
So he's a good chunk of.
It's definitely over a hundred miles I 

2830
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:35,410
can remember.
So for 100 miles.

2831
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:37,030
Yeah.
Whoa,

2832
02:05:37,090 --> 02:05:38,070
Whoa,
whoa.

2833
02:05:38,071 --> 02:05:43,071
I forgot how many hundred miles people 
were strung up on crosses.

2834
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,630
Well,
they add some thousands of,

2835
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:48,990
but he's a nurse for Lilian defeating 
spartacus.

2836
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:52,380
They had leaked already thousands of 
them and so they decided to execute them

2837
02:05:52,381 --> 02:05:57,381
all by sticking demo long colossus 
between Rome and Naples where now,

2838
02:05:58,071 --> 02:06:03,071
where the whole thing went down and um,
make a very public statement about four 

2839
02:06:03,071 --> 02:06:05,540
others.
Leave thinking about labels in the room.

2840
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:07,480
That is Nancy.
Yeah,

2841
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,450
Naples is actually,
it's more than that.

2842
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:14,810
It's because he's not a wire to do that,
uh,

2843
02:06:15,710 --> 02:06:17,730
at the Emmy's wherein,
you know,

2844
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:23,180
big ass fucking platinum cross with some
Nice Diane was on and maybe white gold 

2845
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:26,040
and that's awesome.
Exactly.

2846
02:06:26,041 --> 02:06:29,250
You get the reach thing to do it without
you,

2847
02:06:29,251 --> 02:06:30,330
that rich people will know.

2848
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:35,360
It's like,
what the hell is or the big cross 

2849
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:35,940
tattoo.
That's another one,

2850
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:37,540
right?
It's the same.

2851
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:38,790
I mean,
I get it,

2852
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:42,850
I get what you're trying to do,
but if you've really thought about what,

2853
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:47,890
what the cross was used for Jesus Christ
now I don't think anybody knows that.

2854
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:53,300
I think very few people knew that there 
was a time in history where people were 

2855
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:53,300
strung up on crosses for over a hundred 
miles.

2856
02:06:53,810 --> 02:06:58,810
I mean,
how many actual total humans was that I 

2857
02:06:58,810 --> 02:06:58,860
think has about $5,000,
if I remember correctly.

2858
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:00,930
He wasn't in the thousands,
that's for sure.

2859
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:04,040
I want to say five.
Oh yeah.

2860
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:05,530
But I mean that's,
you know,

2861
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:08,790
that's one of the thing in enrollment 
times they add gazillions,

2862
02:07:08,791 --> 02:07:12,030
laves and yet hardly ever any rebellion.
Well,

2863
02:07:12,031 --> 02:07:14,220
you know why?
Because when they do it,

2864
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:19,240
they got strung up on cross this for 
hundreds of miles and have their power 

2865
02:07:19,240 --> 02:07:19,240
lines.

2866
02:07:19,240 --> 02:07:23,010
They were replaced with power lines.
The same visual of these creepy pap,

2867
02:07:23,180 --> 02:07:28,180
you know the history.
It's power lines are not as creepy as 

2868
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:28,180
crosses brown.
Well,

2869
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:28,830
no,
I mean like,

2870
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:31,440
like those old ones,
like those old ones where there's like a

2871
02:07:31,441 --> 02:07:34,520
million wires all attached to this giant
one.

2872
02:07:34,521 --> 02:07:36,910
Like I have one in the back of my house.
I just look at it every day.

2873
02:07:36,911 --> 02:07:37,480
I'm like,
oh,

2874
02:07:37,481 --> 02:07:39,310
that's not good.
Yeah.

2875
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:44,430
What about those?
You ever drive like the certain towns 

2876
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:47,521
and they have these giant fucking 
enormous ones that they hum when you 

2877
02:07:47,521 --> 02:07:51,571
pass by them and they feed,
you know like towns are like miles and 

2878
02:07:51,571 --> 02:07:52,050
miles away.
Those are,

2879
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:55,600
they can't.
It can't be good next to that right now.

2880
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:58,900
That's got to be fucking with your 
system somehow or some form.

2881
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,270
Yeah.
Is it ever proven that.

2882
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:06,390
I don't know,
but there's a lot of houses even in 

2883
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:08,731
Burbank because burbank uses still uses 
those power lines and there's a 

2884
02:08:08,731 --> 02:08:13,210
humongous ones and their houses below it
and you just kinda feel eerie.

2885
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:17,170
It feels eerie being around that area 
because there's just humming above.

2886
02:08:17,171 --> 02:08:19,390
You like this humongous pool.
There's different ones like you know,

2887
02:08:19,391 --> 02:08:24,391
there's certain areas like really rural 
areas where your past by big fucking 

2888
02:08:24,391 --> 02:08:27,150
giant ones.
I know I don't understand much about the

2889
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:29,380
science behind providing electricity to 
cities,

2890
02:08:29,381 --> 02:08:32,110
but you know,
there's obviously a lot of,

2891
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:34,480
there's a lot of energy going through 
those goddamn things.

2892
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:39,780
If your house is just sitting there,
director of the thing is just right 

2893
02:08:42,221 --> 02:08:47,221
above you.
Is that fucking with some things that 

2894
02:08:47,221 --> 02:08:47,221
you can't see?
I think so.

2895
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:48,640
You think so?
That shouldn't be.

2896
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:53,670
Did you google this?
I'm just talking about what would I 

2897
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:53,670
Google power lines.
Cancer.

2898
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:53,880
It probably.
Yeah.

2899
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:55,230
Cancer's always.
We look for it,

2900
02:08:55,231 --> 02:08:55,930
right?
Yeah,

2901
02:08:56,550 --> 02:09:01,550
but yeah,
that's the scene today that nobody 

2902
02:09:01,550 --> 02:09:01,550
knows.
It's like,

2903
02:09:01,550 --> 02:09:03,740
hm,
we have gazillions causes cancer about 

2904
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:05,380
we don't know why.
There are many,

2905
02:09:05,381 --> 02:09:10,381
many,
many things in our environment that are 

2906
02:09:10,381 --> 02:09:10,420
fucked up from the stuff we eat to this 
stuff,

2907
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:15,740
our land to all sorts of things that we 
don't really know what to what degree 

2908
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:15,740
they were do in Oakland three builds,
but

2909
02:09:15,770 --> 02:09:19,700
the fact that that Msg is even allowed 
to be used today.

2910
02:09:19,820 --> 02:09:24,820
Oh,
you mean just drives me crazy delicious 

2911
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:24,820
though,
Huh?

2912
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:24,820
It is,
but it's so unnecessary.

2913
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:29,471
It was a bad for you or something.
It's proven to give you cancer 

2914
02:09:29,471 --> 02:09:32,890
restaurants.
Restaurants use it all the fucking time 

2915
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:32,890
though.
They don't tell you really.

2916
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:34,370
That's kind of like,
hey,

2917
02:09:34,371 --> 02:09:35,570
thanks.
You might want to say,

2918
02:09:35,571 --> 02:09:40,571
hey,
there's something in here that might 

2919
02:09:40,571 --> 02:09:41,921
cause cancer.
If this guy's telling me this why I 

2920
02:09:41,921 --> 02:09:43,461
smoke cigarettes,
because the Chinese film ain't going to 

2921
02:09:43,461 --> 02:09:43,461
kill you bro.
Unless you're driving through all day,

2922
02:09:43,461 --> 02:09:43,880
every day,
that monosodium glutamate,

2923
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,710
who do you know that we had a funeral 
for your friend because Montessori,

2924
02:09:48,430 --> 02:09:53,430
but man was living large who nobody had 
this Chinese food addiction.

2925
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:55,680
He just could not kick.
Yeah,

2926
02:09:55,681 --> 02:09:58,400
but who knows though.
Definitely known people who have died of

2927
02:09:58,401 --> 02:09:59,360
cancer that just

2928
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:01,220
just not linked linkedin.
MSG,

2929
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:06,340
but how do they know that it is?
It causes cancer in rats or something 

2930
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:06,340
like that.
It's just proven.

2931
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:07,130
Yeah.
We're not rats.

2932
02:10:07,820 --> 02:10:10,460
I think we can.
Rats can eat some shit that we can eat.

2933
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:11,660
No,
we shouldn't.

2934
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:15,460
We shouldn't really go by that.
Yeah.

2935
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:16,790
Yeah.
I'm sure I missed you.

2936
02:10:16,791 --> 02:10:19,090
Is terrible for you.
I think it's like a.

2937
02:10:19,490 --> 02:10:21,320
it's just a flavor enhancer,
right?

2938
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:23,330
Isn't like accent or something like 
that.

2939
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,730
Just a couple of different brand names 
of it.

2940
02:10:25,910 --> 02:10:28,310
I don't know because I worked at a 
restaurant when I was a kid.

2941
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:32,360
Worked in like a Newport creamery,
which is like a hamburger place.

2942
02:10:32,361 --> 02:10:37,361
I think we had this power line cancer 
that can't get a fucking straight 

2943
02:10:37,941 --> 02:10:40,790
answer.
Everybody wants to make you read things.

2944
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:42,470
Just answering me bitch.

2945
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:48,660
In India,
because of a study of 134 people with 

2946
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:51,340
stomach cancer who were avid consumers 
of which food can contain msg.

2947
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:56,520
The federate fetter ration of hotel and 
restaurant owners in eastern India has 

2948
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:58,540
asked its members to refrain from using 
msg.

2949
02:10:58,750 --> 02:11:01,870
There's like a website called 
[inaudible] dot org,

2950
02:11:01,871 --> 02:11:06,871
backslash cancer dot htm.
And it's just all these reports of like 

2951
02:11:06,871 --> 02:11:06,871
where MSG is,
like,

2952
02:11:06,871 --> 02:11:08,090
no,
it's seriously not.

2953
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:10,840
Why are we serving this?
Where are we allowed to do this

2954
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:11,930
deep?
But you do you.

2955
02:11:12,010 --> 02:11:13,310
Are you concerned with it for real?

2956
02:11:13,410 --> 02:11:13,910
Well,
I,

2957
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:15,420
I,
I don't think that's necessary.

2958
02:11:15,421 --> 02:11:20,421
Here's the,
here's the reason why there's a really 

2959
02:11:20,421 --> 02:11:20,421
good Thai place that's in Hollywood.
Uh,

2960
02:11:20,421 --> 02:11:20,421
it,
they,

2961
02:11:20,421 --> 02:11:20,650
they,
they,

2962
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:22,920
I don't want to say the place,
but palms all right.

2963
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:28,160
But it.
But they use MSG and then I had it once 

2964
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:28,160
with meg and then the next time I 
returned,

2965
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:29,760
I'm just like looking at the menu going,
Jesus Christ,

2966
02:11:29,761 --> 02:11:32,830
they put Msg in their food and they have
it right here on the menu that they,

2967
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:34,080
they just like,
hey,

2968
02:11:34,110 --> 02:11:35,340
by the way,
we use MSG.

2969
02:11:35,610 --> 02:11:38,100
So I go,
can I have no MSG?

2970
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:38,910
And they were like,
oh yeah,

2971
02:11:38,911 --> 02:11:39,780
sure,
no problem.

2972
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:41,850
And so I got the same shit I got last 
time.

2973
02:11:42,150 --> 02:11:44,040
It tasted exactly the same.
It was delicious.

2974
02:11:44,041 --> 02:11:46,270
It was amazing.
It wasn't like like,

2975
02:11:46,350 --> 02:11:48,380
Oh wow,
there's definitely at night,

2976
02:11:48,410 --> 02:11:50,880
maybe every government man,
we're really trying to kill people,

2977
02:11:50,881 --> 02:11:53,310
but giving them memos,
chip set or a little allowing it.

2978
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:55,830
That's just weird that that's not a big.

2979
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:57,770
I'm going to google.
Is MSG good for you?

2980
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:01,310
What if it turns out it's good for you 
and maybe they told you that.

2981
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:02,330
Sure.
No problem.

2982
02:12:02,331 --> 02:12:06,350
No MSG on this one.
The white guy get him the same shit.

2983
02:12:06,351 --> 02:12:07,550
You didn't die.
Yeah,

2984
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:12,260
I gotta take a chance by giving you a 
superior product but cutting it out.

2985
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:13,690
Yup.
Good.

2986
02:12:13,910 --> 02:12:14,700
Shut up.
Eat it.

2987
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:16,910
Um,
I don't know man.

2988
02:12:16,911 --> 02:12:18,380
Is it,
is it really that bad for you?

2989
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:20,930
Yeah,
Msg is good for you.

2990
02:12:21,170 --> 02:12:23,300
Okay.
I'm reading something is good for you.

2991
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:27,200
An article on Forbes magazine argues at 
Msg,

2992
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:29,640
monosodium glutamate,
uh,

2993
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:33,260
may actually be good for the world.
What?

2994
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:34,370
Okay.
Hold on.

2995
02:12:34,910 --> 02:12:39,910
Since the onion daily,
you asked the US health nuts avoided 

2996
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:41,480
like the plague,
but many parts of Asia.

2997
02:12:41,481 --> 02:12:44,900
It sits on the table along with salt and
pepper to enhance the flavor of meals,

2998
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:50,350
leading expert in Msg,
senior scientist company named Blah 

2999
02:12:50,350 --> 02:12:50,350
Blah,
blah.

3000
02:12:50,350 --> 02:12:53,510
Insist that the definitive link between 
MSG and headaches has yet to be proven.

3001
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:58,680
Furthermore,
his own research has shown that the 

3002
02:12:58,680 --> 02:12:58,680
hospital's patients,
hospital,

3003
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:01,220
patients who have lost their appetite 
more likely eat their meals.

3004
02:13:01,221 --> 02:13:06,221
When sprinkled with MSG.
This he postulates could help elderly 

3005
02:13:06,221 --> 02:13:09,971
and sick people improve their appetites,
get nutrition they need and live longer 

3006
02:13:09,971 --> 02:13:11,680
or smoke weed.
Smoking weed would do better than Msj.

3007
02:13:11,950 --> 02:13:16,950
Maybe smoking weed.
MSG together is the mother fucker put 

3008
02:13:16,950 --> 02:13:18,590
some mock poop on that shit.
Well,

3009
02:13:18,591 --> 02:13:23,591
I remember it being a big deal.
I remember people were always saying 

3010
02:13:23,591 --> 02:13:23,990
avoid msg.
Like it became a big deal.

3011
02:13:23,991 --> 02:13:25,360
I kind of nowhere,
right.

3012
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:26,730
It was something that people.

3013
02:13:26,870 --> 02:13:30,380
It's like right on kind of.
I think like even one day they're like,

3014
02:13:30,381 --> 02:13:31,290
oh shit,
you know,

3015
02:13:31,291 --> 02:13:32,040
there was this news

3016
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:37,040
report saying that Msg is bad for you 
and then I'd Kinda blew up like radon 

3017
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:40,671
did.
How did people get like wacky rules as 

3018
02:13:40,671 --> 02:13:40,671
to like what you can and can't eat and 
like biblical days,

3019
02:13:40,671 --> 02:13:43,290
like the cloven hoof thing,
it's pork.

3020
02:13:43,291 --> 02:13:46,380
What does that even make sense?
It's probably,

3021
02:13:46,381 --> 02:13:47,650
there are certain,
you know,

3022
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:51,120
animals that are freaking dirty that are
more likely to carry diseases.

3023
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:56,190
People do.
You lead them and just freaking 

3024
02:13:56,190 --> 02:13:56,190
diseases.
Steel gets battered around.

3025
02:13:56,190 --> 02:13:58,350
So let just say that God said you 
shouldn't eat that were done with it,

3026
02:13:58,390 --> 02:13:59,980
like chicken little sis and shit like 
that.

3027
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:02,820
So I mean,
I'm sure it boiled down to reality,

3028
02:14:02,850 --> 02:14:04,890
factual things that people said,
you know what,

3029
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:07,990
we need to make a hardcoded rule because
otherwise people don't respect it.

3030
02:14:07,991 --> 02:14:10,650
So let's make it that God said so and 
you know,

3031
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:12,660
let's have everybody stick to it.

3032
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:18,200
And then of course then they stopped 
making sense when hundreds of years 

3033
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:18,200
later,
thousands of theater slate their article

3034
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:19,860
Nisha and Saturday for.
And so they no longer are,

3035
02:14:19,861 --> 02:14:24,861
you know,
the animals could be cleaner 

3036
02:14:24,861 --> 02:14:24,861
conditionals or whatever,
but then the rules sticks around.

3037
02:14:24,861 --> 02:14:26,300
Some of them are really nuts,
you know,

3038
02:14:26,310 --> 02:14:28,800
like at a certain point in time,
it's not,

3039
02:14:28,850 --> 02:14:33,850
it isn't based on health anymore.
It's just based on this strange 

3040
02:14:33,850 --> 02:14:33,850
tradition.
Yeah,

3041
02:14:33,850 --> 02:14:37,760
there's no.
And that you're guilty if you eat like 

3042
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:37,950
the pig and the swine.
Like that's the big thing about Muslims.

3043
02:14:37,951 --> 02:14:39,020
I don't eat swine.
Right.

3044
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:40,410
You know,
they'll tell you that like,

3045
02:14:40,690 --> 02:14:43,050
I remember that was like a cool thing 
for rappers to say.

3046
02:14:43,051 --> 02:14:45,090
Like back in the nineties,
they don't eat swine.

3047
02:14:45,590 --> 02:14:47,030
You know what,
you don't eat swine.

3048
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,210
Why not?
It's delicious.

3049
02:14:48,211 --> 02:14:50,130
You asshole.
Crazy.

3050
02:14:50,131 --> 02:14:52,620
You don't eat bacon or your heart 
because you don't eat bacon.

3051
02:14:54,140 --> 02:14:56,270
You know,
it's just the idea that your religion to

3052
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:58,620
keep you from Bacon,
just that's all you need to know.

3053
02:14:58,621 --> 02:15:00,450
They're not looking out for you.
They keep you.

3054
02:15:00,451 --> 02:15:03,120
Keep you from barbecue pork as well.
We'll get the fuck outta here.

3055
02:15:03,390 --> 02:15:06,120
Your religion keeps you from spare ribs.
They're assholes.

3056
02:15:06,450 --> 02:15:11,450
They must be assholes.
If you go to Dr Holly [inaudible] in 

3057
02:15:11,450 --> 02:15:13,170
Venice and have the spare ribs and tell 
me that that's not heavenly,

3058
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:18,290
that's not a gift of God.
There's a reason God made those ribs 

3059
02:15:18,290 --> 02:15:18,290
tastes so God damn good.
Right?

3060
02:15:18,290 --> 02:15:20,550
I am done with your religion.
How did you approach it?

3061
02:15:20,551 --> 02:15:23,900
Is like if a religion doesn't electric,
did you about Baker?

3062
02:15:23,970 --> 02:15:24,930
It was awesome.
After you.

3063
02:15:24,931 --> 02:15:27,990
Religion doesn't let you eat vegan.
They're not looking out for you there.

3064
02:15:28,070 --> 02:15:33,070
They're assholes and I like nuts.
I think that we need to make a new 

3065
02:15:33,070 --> 02:15:33,070
religion.

3066
02:15:33,070 --> 02:15:37,520
Are you willing to put this together?
When you do your new book that you're 

3067
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:38,160
going to be able to construct a new 
religion.

3068
02:15:38,190 --> 02:15:40,470
The working title is create your own 
religion.

3069
02:15:40,471 --> 02:15:42,720
So.
So you're going to pick out all the best

3070
02:15:42,721 --> 02:15:47,721
stuff.
That's the idea that have to have any 

3071
02:15:47,721 --> 02:15:49,740
basis in any previous stories or how can
it be substantiated?

3072
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:54,860
Is there any,
you know like you could use scientology 

3073
02:15:54,860 --> 02:15:58,121
is what I mean.
It's not based on faith so it's based 

3074
02:15:58,121 --> 02:15:58,121
on,
you know,

3075
02:15:58,121 --> 02:15:59,440
what makes sense to you,
what seems to work and then you know,

3076
02:15:59,530 --> 02:16:00,840
try it.
And if it doesn't work,

3077
02:16:00,841 --> 02:16:02,670
change it.
But when you're including religions,

3078
02:16:02,671 --> 02:16:06,770
are you allowed to include ones that we 
know somebody made up mean scientology?

3079
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:10,490
I don't know because I feel like it's 
no.

3080
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:12,360
Why is it.
I mean,

3081
02:16:12,510 --> 02:16:15,510
why is it any different than what had 
happened with that one guy with a dragon

3082
02:16:15,511 --> 02:16:18,810
suit that million people died,
but said it was Jesus's brother.

3083
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:20,850
I mean,
eat scientology was sensing that.

3084
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:26,330
Great.
There are a number of people took 

3085
02:16:26,330 --> 02:16:26,330
extremely seriously.
Then I would say,

3086
02:16:26,330 --> 02:16:26,330
sure,
let's play with it.

3087
02:16:26,330 --> 02:16:31,280
I would agree with you if I hadn't met 
so many actors and I think that that's 

3088
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:34,060
why I haven't done so.
It seemed like,

3089
02:16:34,250 --> 02:16:35,560
you know,
the world of acting,

3090
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:39,610
it's a hugely popular,
hugely popular amongst successful people

3091
02:16:39,611 --> 02:16:44,611
as well.
I think it gives them some sort of a 

3092
02:16:44,611 --> 02:16:46,570
framework in which to think and behave 
in a framework of positivity.

3093
02:16:46,571 --> 02:16:47,260
Like,
you know,

3094
02:16:47,261 --> 02:16:48,400
everyone's seen that,
uh,

3095
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:53,530
the Tom Cruise in indoctrination video,
I was talking about a car accident.

3096
02:16:53,531 --> 02:16:55,750
I keep it.
If you haven't seen it,

3097
02:16:55,751 --> 02:16:56,860
folks,
you have to look it up.

3098
02:16:57,670 --> 02:16:59,710
If they haven't pulled it from the web,
I hope God,

3099
02:16:59,711 --> 02:17:02,590
I hope they haven't pulled it.
Do you think they pulled that cubicle?

3100
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:04,330
The yogi.
The one.

3101
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:09,380
Okay.
Because you're a scientologist these so 

3102
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:09,940
fake,
charismatic and it's like,

3103
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,290
God,
he's so good at it.

3104
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:13,420
He will be an awesome cult leader.
Oh,

3105
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:16,330
he might have to do it too.
You might have to step in.

3106
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:21,700
You know,
they have to also stepping up because 

3107
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:21,700
it's not high enough in the 
organization.

3108
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:21,940
No,
no.

3109
02:17:21,941 --> 02:17:26,941
I mean literally dude.
And they have to pump him up a little 

3110
02:17:26,941 --> 02:17:28,060
too mucky thing.
So man,

3111
02:17:28,061 --> 02:17:30,100
I think he's so charismatic.
You can get away with it.

3112
02:17:30,101 --> 02:17:31,510
Just make sure you keep them on a 
podium.

3113
02:17:31,570 --> 02:17:33,520
No one's even gonna know.
But then again,

3114
02:17:33,521 --> 02:17:38,521
everybody is always seen you on camera.
You can always make him look the alert 

3115
02:17:38,521 --> 02:17:39,600
if you see this dude is like,
I don't remember.

3116
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:44,700
Maybe he's not that short,
but I thought from what I heard at is 

3117
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:47,491
like these probably mostly like hobbits 
are not nearly as short as everybody 

3118
02:17:47,491 --> 02:17:47,491
says.

3119
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:51,430
They probably want to make him seem like
more of a loser because he upsets them.

3120
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:53,590
Probably felt good.
He's doing probably probably.

3121
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:58,620
I mean,
come on when there's a guy like Tom 

3122
02:17:58,620 --> 02:17:58,620
Cruise has been,
how many goddamn blockbuster movies over

3123
02:17:58,620 --> 02:18:03,361
and over and over again,
massive success over and over and over 

3124
02:18:03,361 --> 02:18:03,361
again.
You're going to look for flaws.

3125
02:18:03,361 --> 02:18:04,460
He's gay,
Short.

3126
02:18:04,461 --> 02:18:06,190
He's gay.
That's all you ever hear,

3127
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:09,130
Jay short the.
I'm sure there's a name of the lab.

3128
02:18:09,131 --> 02:18:14,131
I love you.
I want your life so you must suck for 

3129
02:18:14,131 --> 02:18:17,281
some other reason.
I wonder how much of an effect 

3130
02:18:17,281 --> 02:18:18,320
scientology has on his success.
I wonder how much of a.

3131
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:21,190
You know how much of what he pulled off 
he would have pulled,

3132
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:24,580
wouldn't have pulled off.
It wasn't deep in the throes of some.

3133
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:26,560
I think you're on your way to convert.
To me,

3134
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:28,580
it sounded cooler and cooler by the sec 
on though.

3135
02:18:28,660 --> 02:18:30,400
Maybe man,
maybe it's the way to do it.

3136
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:32,860
Maybe we need to all join like a 
reasonable cult,

3137
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:35,650
a cult.
It really has his shit together.

3138
02:18:35,651 --> 02:18:38,200
I bring up this over and over again to 
people think I'm fucking serious.

3139
02:18:38,201 --> 02:18:39,970
I want to be clear right now.
No,

3140
02:18:39,971 --> 02:18:42,400
I'm not starting a cult for real.
Just fucking around.

3141
02:18:42,401 --> 02:18:44,590
All right.
We're just bouncing ideas.

3142
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:49,890
They'll not really going to set up a 
compound where people can show up 

3143
02:18:49,890 --> 02:18:49,890
because if you did,
man,

3144
02:18:49,890 --> 02:18:52,150
this is the time of the of the world 
where if you did do that,

3145
02:18:52,180 --> 02:18:52,840
he said,
listen,

3146
02:18:53,050 --> 02:18:54,530
we have 6,000
acres.

3147
02:18:54,531 --> 02:18:56,890
It's in Wyoming.
Anybody can sign up.

3148
02:18:56,891 --> 02:18:59,740
We do a background check on you.
If you're in build a house.

3149
02:18:59,830 --> 02:19:01,560
Come on in,
and we started town.

3150
02:19:02,830 --> 02:19:04,330
Did you imagined?
Yeah.

3151
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:06,040
Yeah.
They would shut that down though,

3152
02:19:06,041 --> 02:19:08,560
wouldn't you think?
My guess is if we did that,

3153
02:19:08,561 --> 02:19:11,950
would you be willing to go and be our 
religious advisor?

3154
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:16,330
I've always want to be the.
Keep everybody on the same page.

3155
02:19:16,590 --> 02:19:19,360
You know I got to crucify them.
If they don't know you can't do that,

3156
02:19:19,361 --> 02:19:20,860
you can't do that.
We're going to try to avoid that.

3157
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:26,400
What we're trying to do is just get a 
bunch of people together that we don't 

3158
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:26,860
really know that much.
Just sue them out of their,

3159
02:19:26,861 --> 02:19:28,100
their,
their current dogma.

3160
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:29,120
Okay.
I like that.

3161
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:30,470
That's all we use.
You know,

3162
02:19:30,471 --> 02:19:31,160
so you,
you,

3163
02:19:31,161 --> 02:19:34,070
you'd be the guy that under like they,
they can't argue with you.

3164
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:40,280
You're having some areas come up.
Let's have a final match cage between 

3165
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:44,830
myself and some areas and see.
We'll get still get the top spot and 

3166
02:19:44,830 --> 02:19:45,500
some areas.
I know the guy interest.

3167
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:46,670
Interesting.
Sam Harris.

3168
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:48,990
Oh Sam Harris,
Pakistanis.

3169
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:53,090
But some areas.
So I agreed to Harris.

3170
02:19:53,180 --> 02:19:58,180
She's going to start his own cult.
It'll break off in its own direction is 

3171
02:19:58,180 --> 02:19:59,060
called to be smarter than our Colt.
I just thread that.

3172
02:19:59,061 --> 02:20:01,530
He started training Jiu Jitsu.
Yeah,

3173
02:20:01,590 --> 02:20:05,180
he's there for awhile.
That's not that long.

3174
02:20:05,190 --> 02:20:06,710
Okay.
In that case,

3175
02:20:06,770 --> 02:20:08,830
taking private lessons.
He's got to come on.

3176
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:10,940
I'm a,
I think it's March 8th is.

3177
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:12,760
He's going to be on and we're going to 
talk about.

3178
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:16,280
Take him on whether steel learning 
before he gets too good.

3179
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:19,130
At what level is your game?
Where you a purple belt level?

3180
02:20:19,131 --> 02:20:22,940
What levels you're gay is weird too 
because I enrolled for the longest time,

3181
02:20:22,941 --> 02:20:25,950
not in formal classes,
so my way is we are,

3182
02:20:25,951 --> 02:20:29,300
because I'm lacking some pieces of the 
game that you should learn when you're a

3183
02:20:29,301 --> 02:20:33,620
fucking white belt.
But then I don't put my weight.

3184
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:38,680
I don't put enough pressure on top.
I don't do some of the stuff that are 

3185
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:41,621
supposed to do that you learn as basics,
but then at the same time I ever like 

3186
02:20:41,621 --> 02:20:45,110
weird us movements that I can tap.
People were insanely better to me really

3187
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:46,940
is a,
it's kind of weird.

3188
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Is A,
I can lose two really 50 people and I 

3189
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,570
can be three to go to people.
So he's hard to gauge in the same way.

3190
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:58,600
Yeah.
Roughly give or take somewhere around 

3191
02:20:58,600 --> 02:20:58,600
there somewhere,
somewhere around the purple's range.

3192
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:00,800
But these a is not regular,
you know,

3193
02:21:00,801 --> 02:21:03,830
I'm better than a purple belt in some 
way and I'm way worse in others.

3194
02:21:03,890 --> 02:21:06,290
And so it's,
my game is a little weird that way.

3195
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:08,360
That's interesting.
Like what,

3196
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:09,630
what do you,
what,

3197
02:21:09,650 --> 02:21:12,350
what style was it that you learned?
What was like the first time?

3198
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:14,560
Um,
I mean as far as good app thing goes.

3199
02:21:14,590 --> 02:21:15,170
Yeah,
no,

3200
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:17,600
I did play.
It was medically,

3201
02:21:17,620 --> 02:21:19,020
you know,
grappling with no geese.

3202
02:21:19,021 --> 02:21:20,810
So he was,
who did you learn from?

3203
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:25,840
I started out with this guy,
Tim Kartra mail was one of the black 

3204
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:26,000
belts from um,
what's his name?

3205
02:21:26,001 --> 02:21:29,190
The guy was starting to crop up Sifaka 
Kleiber.

3206
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:32,240
Luciana,
I'm Carmela was awesome.

3207
02:21:32,270 --> 02:21:34,610
I really like his game.
He was amazing.

3208
02:21:34,611 --> 02:21:39,611
Grabbed Blur and uh,
he showed me some stuff and then a lot 

3209
02:21:39,611 --> 02:21:39,710
of the time I would just add all the way
to people.

3210
02:21:39,710 --> 02:21:44,710
Somebody a daryl garage,
they had their Jujitsu guys come over 

3211
02:21:44,710 --> 02:21:48,191
and we will just throw.
So a lot of it was not the real and 

3212
02:21:48,191 --> 02:21:51,340
formal learning.
A lot of it was learned by doing and 

3213
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:51,770
which has its advantages and 
disadvantages,

3214
02:21:51,771 --> 02:21:56,771
you know.
So I'm missing a lot of stuff that I 

3215
02:21:56,771 --> 02:21:56,771
should know.
But then I have others seeing that,

3216
02:21:56,771 --> 02:21:59,270
like one thing I used to that are like 
blogs,

3217
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:00,820
like vlogs or my game.
He's like,

3218
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:05,830
I catch very dangerous when,
if you're not an asset and the people 

3219
02:22:05,830 --> 02:22:07,790
you're rolling,
we'd know what they are doing.

3220
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:10,160
You don't have to crank them like crazy.
You know,

3221
02:22:10,161 --> 02:22:13,040
you'll catch somebody in some cases when
the guy's not.

3222
02:22:13,041 --> 02:22:14,360
That'd be like,
I would just tell him,

3223
02:22:14,361 --> 02:22:14,810
I'm like,
dude,

3224
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:16,030
yeah.
You know,

3225
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:18,350
the scariest guys who some are,
Paul says for that reason,

3226
02:22:18,351 --> 02:22:20,600
I know he's terrified.
He's seriously scary.

3227
02:22:20,650 --> 02:22:22,590
He's terrifying event because he catches
it.

3228
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:25,920
There's mean article or competition.
So if he doesn't do it,

3229
02:22:25,921 --> 02:22:25,980
the

3230
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,050
guy going to step up and family and.
But he just doesn't give you a chance to

3231
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:31,260
Zap.
You barely have a chance to screaming in

3232
02:22:31,261 --> 02:22:31,740
agony.
Yeah.

3233
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:33,410
Tears guys.
Knees apart.

3234
02:22:33,411 --> 02:22:34,320
Yeah.
It's terrifying.

3235
02:22:34,970 --> 02:22:36,640
Strong too when he jumps on it.
Yeah.

3236
02:22:36,810 --> 02:22:38,820
He's a really unusual,
terrifying guy.

3237
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:43,850
Yeah.
A first terrifying guy that rips his 

3238
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:46,280
legs apart.
I can't remember a guy who was so 

3239
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:46,800
consistent at doing that and you know,
high level mma,

3240
02:22:46,801 --> 02:22:49,560
it's really kind of a characteristic.
Um,

3241
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:52,000
that guy,
the Japanese guy one,

3242
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:56,630
he's one of those two guys are like neck
and neck for the best leg locks.

3243
02:22:57,060 --> 02:22:59,280
He's terrifying.
He's so good at rapping.

3244
02:22:59,281 --> 02:23:00,420
Guys up.
My God,

3245
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:02,280
he's horrifying.
He's got it.

3246
02:23:02,281 --> 02:23:06,750
Also an amazing Omoplata submission 
called the inventory where you go,

3247
02:23:06,751 --> 02:23:11,751
like you have the shoulder lock and then
you grab an esg grip underneath the 

3248
02:23:11,751 --> 02:23:14,850
guy's face and you lean back and it just
snaps his neck.

3249
02:23:14,910 --> 02:23:17,580
It's terrible.
It's a terrible thing because its arm is

3250
02:23:17,581 --> 02:23:19,530
twisted and you're pulling his neck 
back.

3251
02:23:19,531 --> 02:23:24,531
It's nasty.
He's submitted a couple of guys with 

3252
02:23:24,531 --> 02:23:24,531
that.
He gets it all the time now.

3253
02:23:24,531 --> 02:23:28,750
Humanity is one of those guys.
I like his style but it does seem a bit 

3254
02:23:28,750 --> 02:23:30,480
of a Dick because he willing submission,
like he really is just,

3255
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:35,220
he just three per leg apart and he just,
he's dancing around all I have to finish

3256
02:23:35,221 --> 02:23:36,690
guys off.
I mean you kind of have to.

3257
02:23:36,691 --> 02:23:39,630
I mean there was one of the reasons why 
he's so good and so feared is because he

3258
02:23:39,631 --> 02:23:40,220
does that.
Yeah,

3259
02:23:40,250 --> 02:23:45,250
that's true.
And then people will stop early that's 

3260
02:23:45,250 --> 02:23:45,250
dying.
I mean,

3261
02:23:45,250 --> 02:23:45,300
I get it,
it's an advantage.

3262
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:48,570
They're going to try to take his 
conscience of what his idea is.

3263
02:23:49,050 --> 02:23:51,360
They're gonna put his head that's throw,
you know.

3264
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:51,850
Yeah.

3265
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,880
I don't know.
It's fucking hard game,

3266
02:23:53,881 --> 02:23:54,250
man.
Yeah,

3267
02:23:54,251 --> 02:23:55,010
it is.
You know,

3268
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:57,660
that's why like when this rampage thing 
happened to rampages upset at me,

3269
02:23:57,661 --> 02:23:58,230
I'm like,
look,

3270
02:23:58,530 --> 02:24:01,780
he's doing a way harder gig than know 
what,

3271
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:03,450
what,
what he's doing.

3272
02:24:03,451 --> 02:24:07,890
He's a sensitive guy and he's got 
literally one of the most difficult jobs

3273
02:24:07,970 --> 02:24:09,690
to,
to manage on earth.

3274
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:11,580
You know,
he's going to be irritable about shit.

3275
02:24:11,581 --> 02:24:14,010
I'm sorry if I pissed them off.
All I'm trying to do is,

3276
02:24:14,011 --> 02:24:19,011
uh,
assess things to martial arts in mixed 

3277
02:24:19,011 --> 02:24:21,861
martial arts.
Fighting is a got to be one of the 

3278
02:24:21,861 --> 02:24:21,861
hardest ways to make a living humanly 
possible.

3279
02:24:21,861 --> 02:24:23,370
It other than being a soldier,
you know,

3280
02:24:23,371 --> 02:24:25,040
it's like right up there,
right?

3281
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:28,170
I mean even psychologically going into 
the game,

3282
02:24:28,210 --> 02:24:33,210
knowing that somebody has spent the last
year training just in order to repeal 

3283
02:24:33,210 --> 02:24:37,110
thyrex even more effective fashion show,
especially when guys start getting super

3284
02:24:37,111 --> 02:24:42,111
emotional talking shit to each other and
they get in each other's faces at the 

3285
02:24:42,111 --> 02:24:42,111
winds,
you know,

3286
02:24:42,111 --> 02:24:43,860
things get really,
really crazy.

3287
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:46,350
I met them when I was.
When I went to Vegas,

3288
02:24:46,351 --> 02:24:51,351
I met.
I went because I was a meeting and an 

3289
02:24:51,351 --> 02:24:52,150
eco tour and so I got one guy with a 
gun.

3290
02:24:52,190 --> 02:24:56,890
I never met him before and I was really 
blown away by the way you see them on tv

3291
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:02,000
the same way you see me in reality and 
so column is like the opposite of what 

3292
02:25:02,221 --> 02:25:05,100
you expect.
Like I kept asking him about fear,

3293
02:25:05,101 --> 02:25:10,101
you know,
going into it and being afraid and he 

3294
02:25:10,101 --> 02:25:10,101
was like a foreign concept to me.
It was like,

3295
02:25:10,101 --> 02:25:14,270
I think we have so,
so much as a kid and got over the fear 

3296
02:25:14,270 --> 02:25:16,380
of portfolio minus the anxiety,
all of that as a kid that as an adult,

3297
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:21,740
he just looked at it as a problem to be 
solved and there's no big deal and it's 

3298
02:25:21,740 --> 02:25:22,410
another day in the office and I'm just 
like,

3299
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:25,880
how fact that you do not fucking 
superior see Italy,

3300
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:27,580
how do you manage that?

3301
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:29,170
That's I know.
And you know,

3302
02:25:29,171 --> 02:25:34,171
he uh,
fought some of the toughest fighters in 

3303
02:25:34,171 --> 02:25:34,171
the world without attitude.
I remember one time,

3304
02:25:34,171 --> 02:25:38,610
I don't remember who it was he fought,
whether it was Tim Silvia or maybe it 

3305
02:25:38,610 --> 02:25:39,790
was a,
maybe it was Brendan,

3306
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:45,090
I forget who it was,
but he was on the side of the Octagon 

3307
02:25:45,090 --> 02:25:48,570
and uh,
I was looking over at him before the 

3308
02:25:48,570 --> 02:25:48,570
fight started.
He looked over at me and winked.

3309
02:25:48,570 --> 02:25:53,110
I'm like,
this guy is so relaxed so you can just 

3310
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:53,110
look at you and wink right before he 
goes to war.

3311
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:55,900
And he was just so calm about it.
That's one of the reasons why I was able

3312
02:25:55,901 --> 02:25:58,150
to keep fighting until later ages.
He was,

3313
02:25:58,360 --> 02:26:01,330
he was so common,
they're preserved as energy,

3314
02:26:01,331 --> 02:26:02,740
so efficient,
experienced,

3315
02:26:03,130 --> 02:26:05,190
you know,
and that Greco Roman man,

3316
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:08,500
he that the ability to control guys.
Apparently everybody says it.

3317
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:10,540
Randy couture was one of the nastiest 
guys,

3318
02:26:10,541 --> 02:26:12,370
like when he would grab a hold of the 
back of your neck,

3319
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:14,960
like that control was so nasty.
You would like.

3320
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:18,610
There's dudes that have like different 
levels of control and you really haven't

3321
02:26:18,611 --> 02:26:21,070
felt it yet and so you sort of have 
like,

3322
02:26:21,071 --> 02:26:26,071
a lot of times you view a,
if you train with people that only have 

3323
02:26:26,071 --> 02:26:29,071
a certain level of skill and then all of
a sudden you train with someone who has 

3324
02:26:29,071 --> 02:26:29,920
a very high level of skill.
It's baffling to you.

3325
02:26:30,150 --> 02:26:34,060
Do you literally aren't even aware that 
someone could be so good?

3326
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:39,200
It's staggering to you.
And that was a apparently a lot of 

3327
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:40,840
people's assessments of Randy's clinch 
that he would get ahold of you.

3328
02:26:40,841 --> 02:26:43,210
That's why he was so good at like dirty 
boxing guys.

3329
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:45,820
Like when he fought Vito Belfort.
That's amazing.

3330
02:26:45,821 --> 02:26:46,090
Yeah.

3331
02:26:46,090 --> 02:26:48,100
The first Vito Belfort fight,
especially,

3332
02:26:48,101 --> 02:26:49,630
they fought three times,
but the first one,

3333
02:26:49,631 --> 02:26:53,290
especially when he beat Vito and Vito 
was not just undefeated,

3334
02:26:53,291 --> 02:26:58,291
he was just fucking phenol.
He was tearing guys apart in the first 

3335
02:26:58,291 --> 02:26:59,460
round and and randy stopped him and 
randy,

3336
02:26:59,570 --> 02:27:01,720
a lot of it was like that dirty boxing 
man.

3337
02:27:01,721 --> 02:27:06,721
He was so good at it.
Just controlling the back of your head 

3338
02:27:06,721 --> 02:27:06,730
and and pummeling you with shots and,
and,

3339
02:27:06,860 --> 02:27:10,390
and forcing you in the cage and taking 
the right angles and know that was a,

3340
02:27:10,391 --> 02:27:13,570
that was the birth of random third to 
fire fighting.

3341
02:27:13,571 --> 02:27:18,571
UFC was like,
how the hell do you go from zero to 

3342
02:27:18,571 --> 02:27:19,090
fighting Vito Belfort and fucking 
animals.

3343
02:27:19,270 --> 02:27:22,930
He's an animal and a great guy,
nice guy to be around,

3344
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:25,270
you know,
really nice to just around theater.

3345
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:28,000
And I was really very impressed with 
him.

3346
02:27:28,001 --> 02:27:28,540
I was like,
man,

3347
02:27:28,541 --> 02:27:30,010
these guys are as good as they say.

3348
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:32,320
I'm bad.
There is really a cool guy.

3349
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:36,010
I'm excited that because they asked me 
to write a book on his career.

3350
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:39,070
Cool.
I who asks you to do this.

3351
02:27:39,310 --> 02:27:40,560
One of the guys that,
these,

3352
02:27:40,561 --> 02:27:41,760
um,
enjoy gardener,

3353
02:27:41,770 --> 02:27:46,770
he's one of the guys that I know for the
trainers take studying her and so he 

3354
02:27:46,770 --> 02:27:48,340
said let's work on it together,
you know,

3355
02:27:48,341 --> 02:27:53,341
he wanted to do it and then my writing,
so you say helping and we'll write it 

3356
02:27:53,341 --> 02:27:54,880
and do this thing about Ryan because he 
was saying,

3357
02:27:54,881 --> 02:27:57,700
you know,
most of the MMA books that are out there

3358
02:27:57,701 --> 02:27:59,530
out to biographies,
which are cool.

3359
02:27:59,950 --> 02:28:02,260
But then in an autobiography you can 
only go,

3360
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:07,500
you know,
you can only hype it up so much because 

3361
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:07,500
you sound like an asshole.

3362
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:14,040
Whereas doing it as a third person and 
we wheat a lot of the voices from 

3363
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:18,080
Houston bone ends kind of like a early 
type of thing where you get multiple 

3364
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:22,570
feel the,
it's a different way of documentary to 

3365
02:28:22,570 --> 02:28:23,410
man and that's the plan.
In fact,

3366
02:28:23,411 --> 02:28:25,190
to the weight as um,
as a book.

3367
02:28:25,191 --> 02:28:30,191
And then to shoot the interviews.
I was there for his very first fight 

3368
02:28:30,191 --> 02:28:32,930
against Tony Hallmark.
I think it was 1997 or 98.

3369
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:34,760
It might've been [inaudible] 97.
[inaudible] 97.

3370
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:36,250
Thank you.
And uh,

3371
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:40,610
Tony Hama was just giant fucking pro 
wrestler and randy couture,

3372
02:28:40,730 --> 02:28:43,460
doc under that dude's big punch,
got him,

3373
02:28:43,490 --> 02:28:46,550
took him down and strangled his ass.
And I remember thinking,

3374
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:48,470
Holy Shit,
look at that.

3375
02:28:48,471 --> 02:28:51,770
Like that was the difference in like one
guy was like his big,

3376
02:28:51,771 --> 02:28:53,930
strong sort of progress or type 
character.

3377
02:28:54,140 --> 02:28:57,120
But the other one had that,
that stupid grappling strength.

3378
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:02,120
They're remembered from some freaks in 
high school when I wrestled in high 

3379
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:02,120
school,
you know,

3380
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:02,800
when we were in,
um,

3381
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:05,560
you know,
a certain district and I went to the,

3382
02:29:05,561 --> 02:29:10,561
the,
I think it was like the regionals and I 

3383
02:29:10,561 --> 02:29:10,561
forget what it was called,
but you know,

3384
02:29:10,561 --> 02:29:14,270
the guys had one,
like certain tournaments would advance 

3385
02:29:14,270 --> 02:29:17,051
to other tournaments.
And so I got to see like the state 

3386
02:29:17,051 --> 02:29:17,060
champion wrestlers and I got to see like
some of the really high,

3387
02:29:17,061 --> 02:29:19,000
high level wrestlers.
And I'll never forget this,

3388
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:22,480
the way that really good wrestlers could
manipulate guys.

3389
02:29:22,490 --> 02:29:24,170
Like just toss them and throw them 
around.

3390
02:29:24,171 --> 02:29:26,860
I remember thinking Jesus Christ,
like there's like,

3391
02:29:27,110 --> 02:29:29,420
just like anything else,
there's guys out there,

3392
02:29:29,421 --> 02:29:31,790
they're taking it to a very extreme 
level.

3393
02:29:31,791 --> 02:29:34,310
Unless you go and see it,
you don't know that that's possible.

3394
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:38,710
So when I first saw randy in the UFC and
he took down that Tony Hallmark,

3395
02:29:38,711 --> 02:29:43,711
God,
that's immediately what it reminded me 

3396
02:29:43,711 --> 02:29:43,711
immediately.

3397
02:29:43,711 --> 02:29:46,390
What it reminded me of is the first time
that I'd ever seen real good amateur 

3398
02:29:46,390 --> 02:29:46,600
wrestlers and went,
Whoa,

3399
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:51,760
like this is.
This is some shit to deal with right 

3400
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:54,011
here.
Did you think you had a chance when he 

3401
02:29:54,011 --> 02:29:54,011
fought the beater,
like because he needed to beat all those

3402
02:29:54,011 --> 02:29:56,410
guys?
Were the first guys he beat wearing good

3403
02:29:56,450 --> 02:29:59,310
caliber for the ice and then when he 
stepped up to five feet or did you?

3404
02:29:59,350 --> 02:30:01,550
It was a big leap.
It was a big leap.

3405
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:03,260
It was his third fighter,
his fourth fight,

3406
02:30:03,261 --> 02:30:05,830
third fight.
He did that one night go guys.

3407
02:30:05,900 --> 02:30:08,270
And then the next step.
That's incredible.

3408
02:30:08,390 --> 02:30:10,970
That really is incredible.
If you stop and think about that.

3409
02:30:11,270 --> 02:30:11,780
I,
you know,

3410
02:30:11,781 --> 02:30:13,640
I don't think we knew what he was 
capable of,

3411
02:30:13,641 --> 02:30:16,160
but it was really clear early on that he
was just,

3412
02:30:16,161 --> 02:30:18,170
his force of will was just too much.

3413
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:20,510
Randy couture of the most amazing will 
ever.

3414
02:30:20,770 --> 02:30:22,460
You know,
you look back to the first pedro,

3415
02:30:22,461 --> 02:30:23,420
his a fight,
dude,

3416
02:30:23,421 --> 02:30:28,421
Pedro,
his hit him with some of the most 

3417
02:30:28,421 --> 02:30:29,480
horrifying leg kicks that have ever been
landed in an mma fight.

3418
02:30:29,630 --> 02:30:33,740
It took him six months to recoup his 
legs to rehabilitate his legs.

3419
02:30:33,741 --> 02:30:35,270
After that fight,
he showed me,

3420
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:38,980
he still has a hole in his leg.
Muscle died in sport,

3421
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:41,090
the muscle or die.
Think about that.

3422
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:46,300
Pedro Huizar kicks you so hard.
The muscles die for forever in certain 

3423
02:30:46,300 --> 02:30:48,400
spots on your fucking leg.
So Randy go to her,

3424
02:30:48,401 --> 02:30:50,720
gone through that,
and then rehab for six months.

3425
02:30:50,721 --> 02:30:52,940
And then they talked him into a rematch.
He didn't want to do the rematch.

3426
02:30:52,941 --> 02:30:54,450
He's like,
I don't want to fight this fucking guy.

3427
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:56,810
So they give them a rematch and he beats
them down again.

3428
02:30:58,930 --> 02:30:59,500
Yeah,
well,

3429
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:02,450
I think he just knew there's no way I'm 
getting leg kick this time.

3430
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:04,400
It just became,
it didn't become a,

3431
02:31:04,580 --> 02:31:06,380
you know,
I think when you fight a certain guys,

3432
02:31:06,381 --> 02:31:07,520
you start thinking,
oh,

3433
02:31:07,521 --> 02:31:09,950
I can take a lead kicker,
and then you fight Pedro Huizar.

3434
02:31:09,980 --> 02:31:10,730
You were like,
oh no,

3435
02:31:10,731 --> 02:31:11,940
you can't.
No,

3436
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:12,830
you can't.
Yeah,

3437
02:31:13,070 --> 02:31:13,910
that guy,
man.

3438
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:18,940
People don't even know.
One of the reasons why I have such a 

3439
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:18,940
fetish for leg kicks,
like people always saying Rogan,

3440
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:21,860
you're so fucking queer for leg kicks.
They art.

3441
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:24,860
It's because I've seen pedro,
his old fight live and I've,

3442
02:31:24,861 --> 02:31:27,810
I've seen what's possible.
I know what's possible when Kaiser.

3443
02:31:27,811 --> 02:31:28,950
Good man.
I,

3444
02:31:28,951 --> 02:31:30,600
yeah,
I definitely call for them too many,

3445
02:31:31,850 --> 02:31:33,750
but it's because they're awesome when 
they land.

3446
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:35,490
They are not,
they are scary.

3447
02:31:35,850 --> 02:31:36,600
Yeah.
So,

3448
02:31:36,601 --> 02:31:38,700
um,
if people want to buy your book,

3449
02:31:38,701 --> 02:31:42,300
what's the best way to get ahold of it 
through [inaudible] dot com or Amazon?

3450
02:31:42,390 --> 02:31:45,630
Amazon.
And it is the 50 things.

3451
02:31:45,631 --> 02:31:48,360
Was it saying they are not supposed to 
know our religion?

3452
02:31:48,510 --> 02:31:52,380
And Danielle.
And if someone wants to get ahold of you

3453
02:31:52,381 --> 02:31:53,580
on twitter,
what is the uh,

3454
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:54,970
the twitter address?
Oh Shit.

3455
02:31:54,971 --> 02:31:58,640
They want to see it's at dba lightly.
If you see a picture of a,

3456
02:31:58,960 --> 02:32:03,960
the awful in a baby,
it's DBA Allele b o l e l l I.

3457
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:07,340
thanks for coming on again man.
Always cool talking to you.

3458
02:32:07,350 --> 02:32:08,450
We'll have to do it again.
Yeah,

3459
02:32:08,451 --> 02:32:11,670
I love it.
I think some other fucked up part of the

3460
02:32:11,671 --> 02:32:13,940
history of religion or something to.
Hold on.
