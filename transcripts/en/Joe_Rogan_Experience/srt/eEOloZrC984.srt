1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,750
He gives zero fucks.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,810
Your Ratha drove,

3
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:06,520
rode to the experience.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,580
Absolutely.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,780
Absolutely.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,270
It's um,

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:11,891
hey,

8
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:14,160
get back to what you call the cupbearer,

9
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:16,470
which is a double wrist lock.

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,910
Uh,

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,260
when it shows over with,

12
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,200
have I ever showed you how Karl gotch did?

13
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:24,750
It blows the variation the car.

14
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,360
Gosh,

15
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,150
you'd be planning on
putting me into submission.

16
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,530
Why don't you show me on Brian?

17
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,580
You could tap him.

18
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,410
I would be glad I've heard.

19
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:34,500
I've heard nevertheless allow you
to put someone into a position.

20
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,981
Oh No,

21
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:35,320
no.

22
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,390
[inaudible] have a guy like Brian.

23
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:37,801
Brian,

24
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:38,581
you're so gummy.

25
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:41,820
You won't even get hurt if
he said it's a sexual thing,

26
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,213
but not for you.

27
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:44,881
Believe me.

28
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,530
You won't even get a wet.

29
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,501
You know,

30
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:50,334
it's uh,

31
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:51,630
they,

32
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,020
they do the Kubara there
and they grabbed the risks.

33
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,040
Are you going to let them do it too?

34
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,251
Oh,

35
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,084
you're crazy.

36
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,481
Okay.

37
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,314
What does he have to do?

38
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:58,640
Oh,

39
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
I don't believe so.

40
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,570
Please be nice to him.

41
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,920
He's very delicate.

42
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,233
Don't hurt them.

43
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,391
Okay.

44
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,380
The Camorra like that.

45
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,243
Yeah.

46
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,640
We're not going to do this.

47
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,720
This is what you do to put the pain on,

48
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,623
right.

49
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,500
Okay.

50
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:14,681
Now.

51
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:15,670
Here's the difference.

52
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,680
I grow it here.

53
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,083
Now tell me what it is.

54
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,421
Oh,

55
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:20,950
you're doing a wrist lock as well.

56
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:21,521
Oh,

57
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:22,354
I see

58
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,043
the tap too

59
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,060
outrageous.

60
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,630
What you're doing is you're
attacking the wrist as well as that.

61
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:35,464
What it is,

62
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,250
I turn it [inaudible]
instead of going like this,

63
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,330
it's just straight up.

64
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,051
Oh,

65
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:41,770
I see.

66
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,603
Okay,

67
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,390
so you just,

68
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,320
you have his hand twisted around and
he's got no strength to get out of that.

69
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,020
That way your hands all
twisted up like that.

70
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:51,100
Very hard to get any strength.

71
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:51,934
Right.

72
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,133
I won't do it.

73
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,243
He's gonna do it.

74
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,610
He could put his hand between
my legs and a roll me back,

75
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,800
but see that way

76
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,910
don't let him see you doing that.

77
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,773
It's going to hurt you

78
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,373
here.

79
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,463
I'm not going to do it.

80
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:11,920
Okay.

81
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,753
He's going to do it

82
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,180
instead of going like this,

83
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,993
you know,

84
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,743
you're just go up.

85
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,430
Is it harder to hold onto it that way?

86
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:22,264
It seems like,

87
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,330
especially with a sweaty hand
might be a little difficult,

88
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,520
but good for Mae.

89
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,731
Right?

90
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,370
If you could get your thumb inside
the glove and they don't catch you.

91
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,280
It depends how big your hand is called.

92
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:35,531
God,

93
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,260
she had a big hand and
very small woman hands.

94
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:38,900
Yeah.

95
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,060
Brian is a very small woman.

96
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,560
Hands you get let go of him.

97
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:41,771
Gene,

98
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:42,970
you're making me uncomfortable.

99
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,890
I feel like you're gonna
hurt my little buddy.

100
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,461
Get out of there.

101
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:48,821
Brian.

102
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:49,654
Quick.

103
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,430
You just wrestling with a crocodile.

104
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:53,470
You fuck awesome.

105
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,670
Did it felt scary?

106
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,220
No,

107
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,341
no,

108
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:57,050
no,

109
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,491
no.

110
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:58,840
I can see where you could just,

111
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:03,420
just no reason to be a bully and
that's what makes you feel good.

112
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,500
Zero is perfect.

113
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,700
My arm feels cold.

114
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,070
Will you broke a Chino Jean?

115
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,491
The bell broker.

116
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,130
You should be honored here,

117
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,080
one of,

118
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,300
and can you autograph it?

119
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,690
And a lot of graph your cats
don't let anybody get behind you.

120
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,370
Yeah.

121
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,410
You don't ever have let
people do that again,

122
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,130
Huh?
