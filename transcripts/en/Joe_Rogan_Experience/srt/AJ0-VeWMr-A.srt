1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,960
James is wild,
man.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,880
You don't understand and you're still 
getting late.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,900
It's crazy.
You are three,

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,820
one with live.
Got To change subjects had abandoned all

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:13,010
that crazy talk.
We just,

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,150
it was,
it was definitely good talk.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,130
Um,
first of all is good to see you.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,660
Great having.
You do too.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,800
I haven't seen it since king queens 
spent a long time and um,

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,550
I found out about,
you know,

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,680
the whole scientology.
I knew you were into it back then,

12
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:35,430
but it was one of those things where I'd
heard about it and then I met you.

13
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,050
I'm like,
oh,

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,340
it's pretty fucking normal.
Intel wants to.

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,510
And I send the same thing,
like pretty normal.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,300
Kelly Preston is pretty normal.
She was normal,

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,080
you know,
it's,

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,440
I guess you get deeper,
get to know them really well and it 

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,221
might get a little weird because the 
thing is scientologist are good people.

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,370
They really are.
They really as I did,

21
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,340
believed that we were doing amazing 
things for the world.

22
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,790
So they go into it thinking I'm helping 
myself,

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,540
I'm helping others.
Um,

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,620
but then as you,
like you said,

25
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,670
as you get more and more,
uh,

26
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,950
and by the way you don't really get 
close to something intelligent when 

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:17,950
you're assigned to help,
like when you're,

28
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,650
when you're not in scientology is 
correct.

29
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:24,651
Like everything that I did and they do 
is for the purpose of setting a good 

30
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:28,980
example,
being a good person,

31
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:30,870
being a good friend.
Um,

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,900
so to get you in because Dr does a 
purpose and that like I would never tell

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,290
when I was in a non scientologists my 
real problems.

34
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:45,291
It would be kind of a bad for the church
to ever appear human to a non 

35
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:49,230
scientologists it'd be setting a bad 
example.

36
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:53,910
Like it would actually be considered 
like a transgression if I told you joe,

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,400
you know,
Oh yeah,

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,540
I'm fighting with my mother and fighting
with my husband or I would never tell 

39
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,630
you those types of things because it 
would be bad pr for the church.

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,390
Wow.
So that's something that you're taught.

41
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,630
Correct.
Now you,

42
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:09,720
you kinda grew up in it.
Yes.

43
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,520
How old were you when you?
Nine.

44
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:16,521
I think when my mother married,
remember precise intelligence a little 

45
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:18,600
bit and you know,
what I remember precise Intelligi was,

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,960
you know,
I had a very Catholic Sicilian father 

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,920
who believed in punishment,
believed in not toe.

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,460
Did I talk to you?
I don't know what you're talking to me 

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:31,460
like that kind of guy,
right?

50
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,670
Like my dad says that the head of the 
table and then we don't talk back at all

51
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:40,671
or you know,
so that is kind of what I knew and then 

52
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:43,050
we were baptized as Catholics because my
mother wasn't really religious.

53
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,250
My mother is Jewish,
she's,

54
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,550
you know,
so she,

55
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,090
but she didn't have any kind of religion
growing up.

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,120
My father of course was Catholic,
so we got baptized as Catholics and the 

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,110
only time we really went to churches 
with our grandma,

58
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,250
we went to visit her in,
you know,

59
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,790
in the city and my dad on holidays.

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,810
So,
uh,

61
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,470
that's really kind of all I remember 
precise ontology and my mother meeting,

62
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:13,381
my Stepdad,
he was in scientology and he got her in 

63
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:13,381
as well.
US,

64
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:14,590
like right away,
right away.

65
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,480
Yes.
Part of the deal,

66
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,620
correct.
Yeah.

67
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,760
And by the way,
Joe,

68
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,180
like we went from like,
don't talk until you're spoken to,

69
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,540
to hey,
we see you as spiritual beings.

70
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,541
We want you to talk to us.
We want you to communicate like you're 

71
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,210
just,
you're not,

72
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,980
you're not children,
your,

73
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,170
you know,
spirits in a little body.

74
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:40,171
And so immediately that kind of 
indoctrination begins that you're not a 

75
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:40,171
child.
And so,

76
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,110
you know,
as children,

77
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,700
you have kids,
you know,

78
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:47,020
they always want to be grown up so that,
that really starts to work.

79
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:49,720
This kind of idea that you're an 
elitist,

80
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:54,721
that your,
your ego becomes kind of stroked as a 

81
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:54,721
kid.

82
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:57,580
Like you're very powerful and you 
returned and you came back and you found

83
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:02,581
yourself back.
You picked your mother because you knew 

84
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:04,060
she'd get into scientology and you're 
very strongly and you're very strong.

85
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,110
Nicole,
to my sister,

86
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,230
you picked your mother.
You've picked your mother for this 

87
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:10,230
reason,
to find your way back to scientology.

88
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,860
Now as a child,
remember you,

89
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,200
you want to be more important than you 
are.

90
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,270
Kids are always trying to exercise their
power,

91
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:21,271
you know?
So that speaks to something inside of 

92
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:21,271
you that like,
oh,

93
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:21,760
I'm bigger than a kid,
I'm more than a kid.

94
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,880
I'm a spiritual being in a little body.
And so it sets up that kind of 

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,860
indoctrination very early on.
Did you like it because it made you,

96
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,270
when you were young that made you feel 
like,

97
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,140
okay,
now I can express myself better.

98
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,080
I don't feel suppressed.

99
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,100
Yes,
exactly.

100
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,110
Because again,
I'm going from a dad who's tells me to 

101
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,310
shut the F up and walk when I talk to 
you and you sit in that chair and you 

102
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,570
don't have any thoughts worth listening 
to,

103
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,260
to.
You're very much a,

104
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,160
an important being.
You're a big being.

105
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,350
That's a word that's used a lot.
Those words,

106
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,300
big beings,
your big being.

107
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,980
Um,
and so yes,

108
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,830
you start to feel very important.
You start to feel,

109
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,350
um,
that you're powerful.

110
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,870
These are not bad things to make kids 
feel,

111
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,890
but this is the way colts work and you 
don't realize that Joe,

112
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,850
until you're out,
you don't realize any of this was really

113
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:17,851
going on because I've heard people call 
it a cold throughout my 30 plus years 

114
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,920
and I was offended by it.
I was deeply offended by it and I 

115
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,870
couldn't even allow myself to believe 
that I was in a cult.

116
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,440
And so all these epiphany's are only 
happening after the fact while I was 

117
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,361
watching the scholarly documentary once 
on Christianity and they were referring 

118
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:38,180
to it as the cult of Christianity.
And um,

119
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,130
it's the word is the correct word and if
you want to just look at it in terms of 

120
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:49,450
the actual literal definition of it,
but it's automatically got this negative

121
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:53,590
connotation to the word called brainwash
or lost.

122
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:56,230
But there,
there's a,

123
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,810
there's a inclination that people have 
to be tribal.

124
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,330
There's a natural inclination.
People have to be on a team.

125
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:06,350
And we like it when we're all together.
I know you're a scientologist,

126
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm a scientologist.
We're together in this thing.

127
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,190
Everybody else doesn't get it right.
And that's,

128
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,630
that's a good feeling,
right?

129
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,890
And you're taught that you are taught 
that you are the elite of the world by 

130
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:21,830
the way you're going in every single 
day.

131
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,860
It's not like I'm going,
I'm going Easter and I'm going 

132
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Christmas.
You know,

133
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,320
it's an every dayness.
So what did you do every day?

134
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,690
Like when you say you went into real 
life,

135
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,390
do king of Queens and then after 
rehearsal I'd have to drive to Hollywood

136
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,340
and put in my two and a half hours a 
day.

137
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,110
Two and a half hours every day?
Yeah,

138
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,840
every minimum.
Minimum.

139
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,170
Minimum.
Okay.

140
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,660
So then if I couldn't like let's say on 
a tape day,

141
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:45,270
I couldn't,
you know,

142
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,410
it was there from nine in the morning 
until 10 at night.

143
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Asian know I'd have to make up the time 
on the weekends or I'd have to make up 

144
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,890
time on my hiatus.
So I'd be there all day and night.

145
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,300
If you went to Hawaii on vacation or 
something very rare that scientologist 

146
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,770
we're going to vacation.
I'd have to make up the time.

147
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,170
I'd have to make up the time when I got 
back,

148
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,260
I'd have to put in on weekends,
like let's say if my schedule was,

149
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,090
you know,
12 to 2:30

150
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:12,370
to go in and I'd have to go in one to 
six or one to 10 or nine to 10.

151
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,830
So there's an everydayness of this 
indoctrination.

152
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,680
It's not only that there's this 
policies,

153
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:22,010
right?
You're studying the policies all day and

154
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,140
all night you're looking up words you 
don't understand.

155
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:27,020
You're being tested.
Like after you read an l,

156
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:27,930
Ron Hubbard,
l,

157
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,600
Ron Hubbard policy,
then you're tested,

158
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,480
you go into another room and they go,
what is the definition of this?

159
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:34,350
What is the definition of that?
So it's,

160
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,310
it's almost worse.
Uh,

161
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,080
we had a cult expert on and he said,
it's worse.

162
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:44,081
I entered the doors because you actually
brainwash yourself because you have to 

163
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:47,891
study the policies of the church and 
then you get tested on it and you have 

164
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:48,650
to look up words you don't understand.

165
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,960
You have to put them in sentences.
You have to write essays,

166
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:55,961
you have to do clay demonstrations.
So you're really brainwashing yourself 

167
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:58,070
and you're speaking all the same 
language,

168
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,370
you're all working towards one goal and 
that is very intoxicated like it is to 

169
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:07,160
feel like you're saying,
to be tribal,

170
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:12,161
to be part of something.
Imagine being something part of 

171
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:15,071
something that you think and and are 
told and are reading every day is the 

172
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:16,690
most important thing.
That's gonna.

173
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Save mankind.
You are doing the work that no other 

174
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,880
group is doing and so you believe that 
you start.

175
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,750
You want to believe that you want to 
believe I'm more than just an actress.

176
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,270
I'm more than just this,
I'm saving the planet.

177
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,250
And now all this stuff that you're 
doing,

178
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:33,200
you're going in for two and a half hours
every day.

179
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,210
Are you trying to move your way up the 
ranking system?

180
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,930
Because there's a chart,
right?

181
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,000
And everybody's a well,
there's like a.

182
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,020
The indoc like the little courses,
they're called self improvement courses 

183
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,920
and these are the things that I,
people like me would say,

184
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,720
like when people would ask me about the 
money,

185
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,470
right?
I said,

186
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:56,430
well,
there's courses for $35,

187
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,380
$65.
You know,

188
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:01,080
it's all it,
it's very affordable like these,

189
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,310
these are the lines that were taught to 
say it's not an outright lie,

190
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,040
it's,
it's omitting a lot of data,

191
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,710
right?
Because really the next,

192
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,400
the followup to that is,
but when you're really a scientology,

193
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:19,020
it's going to cost you half a million 
easy or whatever it's going to be,

194
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:24,021
but it's preset prices.
So you start on these self improvement 

195
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,370
courses and then you get onto this 
actual chart called the bridge.

196
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,940
And the bridge is very precise.
Nobody's doing different things.

197
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:35,340
We're all working at the bottom all the 
way up to the top,

198
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,680
which was ot eight.

199
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,500
That's like the most enlightened.
So how many people were Ota?

200
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,370
Uh,
not a lot anymore because the people who

201
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:46,680
were in scientology and the fifties,
sixties,

202
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,610
and seventies who got to Ota,
uh,

203
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,510
we're like,
this is some bullshit.

204
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,160
It wasn't what I thought it was going to
be.

205
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:58,161
And so a lot of them left at a time.
I'm sure scientology was big because it 

206
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,610
was almost,
it almost spoke to the time that it was,

207
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,560
you know,
when people wanted free thinking,

208
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:08,130
but also wanted to be morally on the 
right path,

209
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,390
you know,
not on drugs,

210
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,890
like they were,
you know,

211
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,440
maybe not part of that,
but they,

212
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,420
they kind of didn't want to be held by 
a,

213
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,580
you know,
a certain,

214
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,950
a religion,
but they did still wants virtuality and 

215
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,430
their life and I think it spoke to the 
people of the time.

216
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,570
Um,
so I don't think you're,

217
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,090
you're going to find new scientologists 
in the world.

218
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,250
The Internet took a big chunk out of 
that.

219
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,070
Yes.
Because of the information.

220
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,340
Information was very hard to get a,
for example.

221
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,900
Oh yeah.
For example,

222
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:43,710
let's say you are scientologists and um,
one day I just didn't see you.

223
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,130
And I said,
hey,

224
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:46,080
what happened to Joe?
Where's Joe?

225
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,120
Why is he not in scientology anymore?
Oh,

226
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:53,121
they,
they tell me whatever they want to tell 

227
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:53,730
me about you to discredit you.
He's an enemy to the church and here are

228
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:56,790
the reasons why.
And they could say anything.

229
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,240
And they do say anything that 
immediately makes me not want to talk to

230
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:02,730
you ever again.
The common enemy,

231
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,620
an enemy.
Once you're an enemy,

232
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,470
I can't actually talk to you.
I can't actually talk to you.

233
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:12,471
The policy says that once you are 
declared labeled a suppressive person,

234
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,470
my association with you would then make 
me a suppressive person and then me and 

235
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,271
enemy so I can't actually talk to you,
but they can tell me whatever they want 

236
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:23,790
to tell me about you.

237
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,390
And so I couldn't actually find out are 
these things true about joe?

238
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,450
But now with the Internet,
with social media,

239
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,920
it's harder and harder to,
to tell people whatever you want to tell

240
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,620
them about the person because the 
information is there.

241
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,790
You have to want to seek it out.
I didn't seek it out.

242
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,250
Um,
I didn't want to seek it out.

243
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,320
And when I did seek it out and I'd go to
the church,

244
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,820
they'd say,
that's a lie.

245
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,700
That's not true.
Here's the real data.

246
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,620
And they have actual doctored,
you know?

247
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,940
Um,
it,

248
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,660
it actually doctor things that make you 
believe,

249
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,110
I mean,
you don't,

250
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,030
you're not going to go and take it to an
analyst,

251
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,470
you're not going to take it to somebody 
and go,

252
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,520
is this a real document?
Um,

253
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,210
you,
you tend to believe the church you're in

254
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:09,640
and raised in most of your life now.

255
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,640
It had to have been positive in some way
for you,

256
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,510
of course,
gave you some confidence.

257
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,600
It gave you a true belief in yourself 
that you are on the right path.

258
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,750
Because I had seen some interviews with 
you where you were talking about it when

259
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:27,170
you were in it and you genuinely seem to
believe that it was very beneficial to,

260
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,280
of course there's basic morals and basic
tools to help you in your life.

261
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,930
But remember it wasn't educated.
Most scientologists are not educated.

262
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,440
And so as far as a college education,
any education?

263
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,180
Yeah,
I left school in the eighth grade.

264
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,530
Really?
Scientology does not value a traditional

265
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:52,531
education.
They value your education in high 

266
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:52,531
school.
Never.

267
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:53,830
Whoa.
How old were you?

268
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,600
I don't know how old you and Heisler.
I don't even know the eighth graders.

269
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,940
Like 13 I think.
Right.

270
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,660
So when you were 13 you just stopped 
going to school,

271
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,720
stopped going to school and I was doing 
scientology and I was working like 

272
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,330
literally working,
selling car insurance and you were 

273
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,050
working at 13 or scientology companies 
and so was my sister.

274
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,280
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

275
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,090
But,
uh,

276
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,590
and people ask like,
well,

277
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,500
how come the,
uh,

278
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,840
nobody did anything.
How come child protective services,

279
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:24,310
who's calling them who saying and not to
mention where are then aligning.

280
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:27,190
Our parents are lying saying they're 
getting a private education,

281
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:32,191
they're getting tutored at home or 
they're going to a scientology school,

282
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,940
which is partially true or I,
yeah,

283
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,920
I got my ged.
So I did things like that to,

284
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,460
to um,
but the,

285
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,640
the original question was what was the,
because it was about me learning what it

286
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,700
was about late.
What was your original question?

287
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:53,701
Because I was answering,
it had to be of some benefit to you 

288
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,270
because it gave me confidence because I 
thought I was getting,

289
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,980
you know,
I'm looking at these big words.

290
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:58,660
I'm using a dictionary.
I'm like,

291
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,240
you're doing more school than you 
could've ever imagined.

292
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,980
Even as you know,
and,

293
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,870
and you,
um,

294
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,920
I started to feel like,
oh,

295
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:09,190
I'm,
I'm really accomplishing something.

296
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm so,
yes,

297
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:15,280
there are benefits to it,
but I didn't realize because I was a kid

298
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,540
that the things you're talking about 
that were beneficial in the real world,

299
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,570
I thought they were.
They were invented by Elbert Hubbard as 

300
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,871
most people do believe that.
So you're saying where these things are 

301
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:31,551
beneficial.
I would have learned these things as 

302
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:34,041
Sunday school.
I would have learned these things about 

303
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:34,041
being a good human being,
being around other people,

304
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,330
but regardless if I was brainwashed into
believing that I was doing great things 

305
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:41,710
and learning great things and that does 
work.

306
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,670
You know what I mean?
It,

307
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,340
it does work.
If I say,

308
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,150
Hey Joe,
if you do these steps,

309
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,750
these take these steps and you really 
truly believe in me,

310
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:55,590
you can then attributed to Leah.
You can say Lhi as an amazing life 

311
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,931
coach.
She told me to do these things and 

312
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:58,931
without her I can't.

313
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,410
You know what I'm saying it,
but not knowing that it was available to

314
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:02,880
me in the real world because I didn't.
I thought I'll.

315
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,610
Ron Hubbard had come up with these 
things.

316
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,180
Now.
When did it start to unravel for you?

317
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,060
Well,
it's a,

318
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,730
it's,
it wasn't just one thing.

319
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,190
I think people always think what was the
one.

320
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,230
It wasn't just one thing was just,
it was six years of me basically.

321
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,930
I was like begging them for these things
not to be true that I was hearing about 

322
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,680
like what it was.
For example,

323
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:35,681
when I went to Tom Cruise's wedding and 
I saw the leader's wife wasn't there and

324
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:36,760
the,
you know,

325
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,800
David Miscavige,
who's the head of the Church of 

326
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Scientology,
uh,

327
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,520
his wife wasn't there.
And when I asked the question and I 

328
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:45,520
said,
where is shelly?

329
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,760
Why is his assistant here?
I'm scattered people to scattered.

330
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,850
And then I was told I didn't have the F 
and rank to be asking about a human 

331
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,750
about the leader's wife.
It wasn't that she was just an average 

332
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,630
person that I didn't have the rank to 
ask about the rank,

333
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,470
the rank.
Wow.

334
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,480
And so that,
that would be okay.

335
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:10,481
That was the beginning.
But then when I went to my friends now 

336
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:10,481
w,
W,

337
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:12,290
when you're my friend,
I consider you family.

338
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,290
Like I really do.
I take my friends very seriously.

339
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,640
And um,
my friends have 35 years.

340
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,290
You're looking at my sex meet nails 
right now.

341
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,190
You're wanting my sexy nails.
You do a very nice nails.

342
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,500
You didn't use the word sexy though,
you said Nice.

343
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,120
You know,
I'm different than other people when it 

344
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,830
comes to nails apparently.
Because now when you say real,

345
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:35,080
what does that mean?
Glued on?

346
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:40,210
No,
they're not going to know that I'm 

347
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,210
appreciating the more.
Okay.

348
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,930
We're finding out a lot about you.
I'd like to do a whole couple of hours 

349
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:49,580
with you talking about other things.
You have to hold onto cans and you don't

350
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:54,581
have to hold on cans,
but you do have to wear Cologne because 

351
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:54,581
Cologne wearing.
Okay.

352
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,990
You're too cute.
Um,

353
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,190
so.
Okay.

354
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,420
So let me get back.
What was I saying?

355
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,690
David miscavige.
You have the right to question.

356
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:07,130
Yeah.
But then seeing my friends' reaction to 

357
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,670
it where I said,
what you need to get involved in this,

358
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:10,910
I think there's something really off 
with David Ms Dot.

359
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,340
Well,
I didn't know what was going on.

360
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,530
I saw Tom have an executive role in our 
church,

361
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:19,400
which had a problem with.
Because remember,

362
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,970
uh,
you learned very early on what l Ron 

363
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,210
Hubbard says is the law.
There's no,

364
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,340
um,
it,

365
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,670
it,
it's not up for interpretation.

366
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:35,360
There's no assimilation of data.
It's just what it says.

367
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,350
It's not what Joe thinks over.
Ron Hubbard said what Leah things.

368
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,560
It's what it says.
And it's very strict.

369
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,210
It's always,
what does ela reach say?

370
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,430
Read it again.
What does it say?

371
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,040
And it's very tough.
So I was very by

372
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,290
the book person.
I'm a by the book person.

373
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,360
Okay.
If I have a recipe,

374
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:59,361
I followed exactly.
I don't do pinches and I'm doing that 

375
00:17:59,361 --> 00:17:59,880
shit.
I do exactly how it says in the recipe.

376
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,240
And then I see how it goes into that.
Scientology is about word for word.

377
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,150
What does it say?
My understanding and the policy is there

378
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:16,341
is no celebrity that should be treated 
any differently than any parishioner,

379
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,130
and I was seeing behavior and I was 
seeing things that wouldn't be okay,

380
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,750
that are not okay for the average 
parishioner,

381
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,080
but we're being made to be okay for Tom 
and it didn't matter to me that he was 

382
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,290
taught to me.
I saw him as a team member in the Church

383
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,540
of Scientology and we were working on 
the same thing.

384
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,370
Um,
I actually thought I was a better 

385
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,370
example of scientology than he was and I
wrote reports on him,

386
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,941
like internal reports on him,
which I didn't realize we're kind of 

387
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:49,380
getting me a to be a target for the 
church,

388
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:51,600
but I didn't realize his position in the
church.

389
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,630
You wrote internal reports?
Yes.

390
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:56,760
We're all required to write reports on 
each other.

391
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,590
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

392
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:01,890
There's a policy.
There's a policy about writing reports.

393
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,250
So if I,
let's say you and I are scientologist.

394
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,670
Okay.
You and I go out one night,

395
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,390
like not like that Joe.
So don't get it.

396
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,370
You seem uncomfortable.
No,

397
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,010
no,
no.

398
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,870
You did it because he said Nice as 
opposed to that you said Nice,

399
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,260
nice,
nice.

400
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,660
I said,
I think I probably on my sexy nails.

401
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,290
He said they're nice.
They're nice.

402
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,590
They're beautiful.
Suck better.

403
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,500
Okay.
If you wore Cologne,

404
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,700
I feel like you'd have better 
adjectives.

405
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,440
Okay.
I'm like,

406
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,830
are you a fine guy when your wife comes 
out as,

407
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,080
as I look Jodie,
you say,

408
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:38,410
fine.
No,

409
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,230
you look great.
You say great.

410
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,880
Beautiful.
Lovely.

411
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,730
It's very clinical.
You have kid comes from I think 

412
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,491
different adjectives.
Different words have different meanings 

413
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,951
depending on who,
what person they come from and how the 

414
00:19:54,951 --> 00:19:54,951
person with the intent behind it.

415
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,730
Well,
beautiful.

416
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:58,590
You look beautiful.
I Dunno,

417
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,310
I guess.
Yeah.

418
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,020
I mean evangelists says I looked 
beautiful.

419
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,700
Let's go back to the internal reports on
topic,

420
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,680
so yeah,
so let's say you go,

421
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:07,530
you and I went out.
We were just went out one night.

422
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:12,531
We were going out for dinner,
a group of us and something and I saw 

423
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:16,140
you doing something that's not for the 
book.

424
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:18,330
I have to write a report.
I read aloud to drink.

425
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,620
Not really,
no.

426
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,860
Okay.
What if I got lit up?

427
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,950
Um,
I'd probably write a report and say,

428
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,560
come on,
fuck it.

429
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:25,810
LRH would love it.
I.

430
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,610
Okay.
I said yes.

431
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,460
So then I write a report on you.
And I said Joe was acting inappropriate.

432
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:37,461
He was making fun of l Ron Hubbard 
because you're not allowed to joke and 

433
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:40,401
degrade Ron Hubbard as a policy called 
joker's integrators and integrators.

434
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:43,650
Yes.
You and I would be very much I've been,

435
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,770
yes.
Have you been in trouble for that many 

436
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:48,770
times.

437
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,530
Okay.
So I would have to write a report.

438
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:55,531
It's go writing you up.
I'd have to write you up because let's 

439
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:57,460
say you went into like the next day for 
a session and you said,

440
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,030
and they said,
you know,

441
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,400
they do the check,
they do a check on you every day.

442
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,460
Um,
do you have an upset?

443
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,820
Do you have a present time problem or 
are you withholding anything?

444
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,700
Now,
if you were a real swing intelligence,

445
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:14,701
you would know that you probably 
shouldn't be drinking and carrying on 

446
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:18,060
because of a 24 hour rule.
You can't drink 24 hours before you're 

447
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,620
going to be doing a service.
Remember,

448
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:24,010
you're required to go in every day so 
you never can drink.

449
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,440
Right.
And if you do,

450
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,680
you consider it a transgression.
So that's on your mind that you're 

451
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,200
withholding this information.
Now,

452
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,300
if you went on a vacation and you knew 
that you were going to make it up when 

453
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,300
you got back?

454
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,440
Yeah,
that's okay because you're not going in 

455
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,440
because you're not going in.
Okay.

456
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,290
That's the only time then.
Correct.

457
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Or if you're just not getting a service,
but that's if you're not going to 

458
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,100
correct.
So you go in and you'd say,

459
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,350
okay,
so I went out last night,

460
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:55,351
I ordered a bunch of shots and I made a 
comment about to l Ron Hubbard or 

461
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:55,870
whatever,
and they go,

462
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:56,590
okay,
great.

463
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:58,060
When was it?
Who would you do it with?

464
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,160
Who was there?
They write down all the names.

465
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,640
It's also being recorded and they're 
writing everything down.

466
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,340
Who knew about it will be the next 
question.

467
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,690
Who knew about it?
You'd say,

468
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:08,620
well,
Leah was there.

469
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:09,520
They go.
Leo was there.

470
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:10,360
Okay,
interesting.

471
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,390
Then that is going to write.
Leah knew about it and didn't do 

472
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:15,670
anything about it.
Then I'd get pulled in.

473
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,650
Why didn't you write a report on Joe?

474
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Because Joe just admitted that he was 
drinking and carrying on and you didn't 

475
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,040
write him up.
Do you see what I'm saying?

476
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,560
So it creates that kind of environment.
So it's a rat environment.

477
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:27,430
Correct.
So I was.

478
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,010
I was writing up Tom and I was writing 
up David,

479
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:31,120
Ms Dot Gavin.
What did you write up,

480
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:36,121
Tom,
for jumping on couches and being 

481
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:36,160
inappropriate.
I thought he was being inappropriate.

482
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,190
Jumping on couches for when he did 
Oprah.

483
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:44,191
I thought it was a bad example that also
wrote up John for for the battlefield 

484
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:46,180
earth.
I thought it was for the movie itself.

485
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,370
First of all,
that movie was awesome.

486
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,940
If you haven't seen battlefield earth,
it's one of my favorite.

487
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:53,860
Unintentional.
He would joke.

488
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,790
No,
it was terrible.

489
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,780
Yeah,
but awesome.

490
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:57,530
Because it's so terrible.
Ridiculous.

491
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,050
Terrible becomes good.
It crosses over that.

492
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,600
It does.
After a while.

493
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:02,080
You're right.

494
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,720
It does,
yeah.

495
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,560
What's that movie with the dancing one 
with Elizabeth Berkley showgirls,

496
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,560
showgirls,
showgirls.

497
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,640
Yes.
That's the best one.

498
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:14,641
Yeah.
That's probably the terrible movie 

499
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:14,641
becomes awesome because it's so bad.
You're like,

500
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:16,240
what in the fuck were they doing?
And it's fantastic.

501
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,440
You're like,
yes,

502
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,210
I can feel the earth is right up there.
Right.

503
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,580
So I did things like that.
I'm not that.

504
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:23,940
I was a great example,
nor am I a great example,

505
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,100
but I wrote a whole thing about him 
jumping up on Oprah's couch,

506
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,350
but I also listen.
I gave myself up.

507
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:31,450
I know I was writing,
I was writing myself up.

508
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:36,451
I was reading my mother up,
I was writing my husband and he jumped 

509
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:36,451
up on Oprah's couch because he was in 
love,

510
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:36,640
right?
Supposedly,

511
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,660
you know,
he jumped up,

512
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,630
they told me,
they pulled me in and they said,

513
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,450
you know,
could it be that you're just not as high

514
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,310
on the scale like in life,

515
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,110
like you're.
So basically they were saying like,

516
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:53,111
you're a bitch so you can't understand.
You can understand that kind of love 

517
00:23:53,111 --> 00:23:57,190
because I was like all,
I guess because I've been married 20 

518
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,190
years.
I don't understand jumping on account,

519
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,500
but I thought it was a.
It wasn't a good example because because

520
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:08,801
I cared so much about my church and the 
work that we were doing and I didn't 

521
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:12,521
want the church to be seen as a joke,
or it's or one of its senior members,

522
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:17,861
which he's considered a senior.
Scientologist thought it was 

523
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:18,360
inappropriate.
It was out of line.

524
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,830
I just wanted him.
Right.

525
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,440
I mean,
listen,

526
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,690
I'm not perfect.
I mean,

527
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,750
of course there's many things that would
be considered a bad example in my every 

528
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,120
day.
I'm not a great example.

529
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,490
Um,
but at the time I thought I was pretty 

530
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:34,490
pristine.
But looking at it now,

531
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,120
you feel like it's totally innocuous.

532
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,250
He's just on a couch jumping around 
having a good time.

533
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Yes.
But if you knew how serious scientology 

534
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,710
was about clearing the planet,
it did not go with our intentions and 

535
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,040
our goals.
Um,

536
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,290
so anyway,
I was writing him up and I was writing 

537
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,061
everybody up and I was writing everybody
up at the wedding because I thought our 

538
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:52,190
senior executives were.
And I was like,

539
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,590
wiring them back from Italy,
from my hotel room,

540
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,120
uh,
calling one of my closest friends who 

541
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,120
was a scientologist and I'm like,
and then I need you to write this.

542
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,151
I need you to write this verbatim.
I need you to write this verbatim and I 

543
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:04,151
need you to get this to the watchdog 
committee.

544
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:08,890
And I think I took frantic.
I was frantic and I was heartbroken 

545
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
because it's like seeing if you believe 
that the sea organization and the people

546
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:19,970
at the higher,
you know,

547
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,240
that our senior executive Strada of your
church are living a pristine and perfect

548
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:30,641
life that you're trying to aspire to,
that you're spending your day and night 

549
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,290
and money and time like you.

550
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,650
This is what we're trying to be.
And I'm seeing not great examples of 

551
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,740
what this is now.
Like it seemed behind the curtain.

552
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:41,210
I was like,
I don't want to see this.

553
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,910
And I really thought I was going to save
the church.

554
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:48,911
I thought my writing reports,
it's like I'm going to take over the 

555
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:48,911
church and I'm going to get it right by 
l,

556
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:53,651
Ron Hubbard.
I really still believe in the policies 

557
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:57,250
of l Ron Hubbard.
I just believe they were bending the 

558
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,321
rules for celebrity and I was like,
he's a celebrity who gives a shit what 

559
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:03,611
he's doing.
Like he's a scientologist first and a 

560
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:04,610
celebrity second to me,
so that's why it's difficult.

561
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,670
I don't want to talk shit about another 
actor because we've all met asshole 

562
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,020
actors and we're not really supposed to 
be talking about them.

563
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,920
Do you know what I mean?
It's just.

564
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,950
You don't hear that a lot.
You don't hear a lot of actors doing 

565
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,890
that to other actors,
but for me it was just a scientologist.

566
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,470
So you take out these reports on him.
I write these reports.

567
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:29,270
I'm sent to Florida immediately.
The Mecca,

568
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:33,460
the hub of psychology.
That's right for interrogations.

569
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,430
No,
and I mean like interrogation to fly out

570
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:38,990
there.
I fly out there.

571
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,680
I'm a in the room.
I'm in a room,

572
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,280
you know,
with cameras,

573
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:48,180
with my person who is armed with 
information,

574
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,210
unbeknownst to me have a stack of 
reports that were written on me by 

575
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:56,880
everybody who worked for Tom a stack.
Now,

576
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,300
let me tell you about your report,
so he decided that everyone who works 

577
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,560
for him has to take out a report on you.
I don't know what he knew,

578
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,430
but that that is that the church is very
much involved with his life.

579
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,700
He's staffed by people who work for the 
church.

580
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:16,730
No non scientologists works for him,
but it was if you say something bad 

581
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:22,311
about this person,
you were talking about God and you and I

582
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,930
was asked,
you have sexual intentions towards him.

583
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:26,940
What are your evil intentions towards 
him?

584
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,370
What are your evil intentions towards 
David Miscavige?

585
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:34,371
What are your evil intention towards l 
Ron Hubbard and it was three months of 

586
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:36,390
this.
It was and I had to retract everything I

587
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:37,620
said.
I said I made it all up.

588
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,870
I didn't see any of it to get out of 
there,

589
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,620
and so then when I came back to la they 
said they want to see you again here in 

590
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,750
celebrity center.
So I went to celebrity center and they 

591
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:50,750
said,
look,

592
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,390
everything that was done to you was 
wrong.

593
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:52,620
I was like,
right,

594
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:54,900
I know that.
We just want to let it go.

595
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,900
You need to let it go because if the 
fact that you're not letting go means 

596
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,110
that you're guilty of the crimes that 
you're saying.

597
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,360
You're saying that everything was wrong.
That was done to you in Florida because 

598
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:09,480
they wanted me to come back because I 
was kind of like,

599
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,490
I'm not.
When I came back from Florida is kind of

600
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:14,370
not really a dedicated scientologist 
anymore,

601
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,080
but I wasn't doing anything to rock the 
boat with my family.

602
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,610
And how long were you in Florida?
For?

603
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,600
Three months.
Three months of,

604
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,930
of,
of dealing with this every day for three

605
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:29,820
months.
I had to write apology letters.

606
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,570
So you're there for 90 days?
Tom Cruise during my hiatus and shit.

607
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,930
Yeah,
yeah,

608
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,810
yeah.
That's what I'm doing most of the time.

609
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,240
And,
and we have a family.

610
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,970
You're married.
My mother was there,

611
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,140
my daughter was there,
my husband was there.

612
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,140
And how much the other day are you 
spending all day?

613
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,130
All Day.
All Day.

614
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,750
Every day.
Did you see defending your life?

615
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,950
No.
Oh God.

616
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:53,840
You have to see it.
What is it?

617
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,870
It's a movie where Meryl Streep and I 
forgot the name anyway,

618
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:59,840
they die and they go into the,
you know,

619
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:03,540
the holding cell like where they're 
going to decide their fate,

620
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,570
are they going back to Earth which is 
considered hell or they going on to 

621
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,591
heaven and Meryl Streep lived a pristine
life and they review your life,

622
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,080
right?
And they have judges and everything,

623
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:21,081
right?
So they review good moments and bad 

624
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:21,540
moments of your life and they decide are
you going to go on,

625
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:26,010
are you going to go back to hell?
And Meryl Streep was of course pristine,

626
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,390
but then the guy that I keep forgetting 
just run and saying,

627
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,580
um,
but you know,

628
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:34,581
they were looking at times where he 
didn't stick up for himself or where he 

629
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:34,581
pussied out of something.
Right?

630
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,050
And so they were judging him pretty 
harshly,

631
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:39,600
right where they were like,
you need to come back in the morning.

632
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:41,070
And like,
it was like an old day.

633
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,190
Like we're reviewing

634
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,090
a 120 days of your life,
right?

635
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Meryl Streep,
they looked at like five days and 

636
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,440
they're like,
don't worry,

637
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,440
just come back when you can.
I was,

638
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,850
that was me,
like my mother was there to do some 

639
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:53,850
fluff thing and she was like,
oh,

640
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,650
come have lunch with me.
And my person was like,

641
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,660
be back in 10 minutes.
You go get a sandwich and eat in the 

642
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:00,660
elevator and you need to be back here in
10 minutes.

643
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:00,820
It was like,
for me,

644
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:03,630
it was like defending your life because 
my mother was just like,

645
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,390
she had,
she was,

646
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,160
she didn't know what was going on.
She didn't.

647
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,880
You don't usually tell your family what 
you're doing.

648
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:13,690
I wouldn't tell my husband what was 
happening to me because I didn't want to

649
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,620
create.
Can you imagine this idea?

650
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,080
Meet your husband in scientology?
No,

651
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,100
my husband was out.

652
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,680
He was never in.
I'm buying him a,

653
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,460
you made him,
made him a scientologist.

654
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:29,461
Um,
which is good because he was still kind 

655
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:29,461
of cool,
you know what I'm saying?

656
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:33,031
So he wasn't like,
he was still kind of freaky a little 

657
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:33,031
bit,
you know,

658
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,740
still believed in slapping and ass once 
in a while.

659
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,800
So like I kinda got of both worlds.
You can't slap,

660
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,550
you're considered aberrated choking?
Absolutely not.

661
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,800
It would be,
honestly,

662
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,260
you would be considered like you've 
really.

663
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:52,080
There's something really wrong with him,
you know?

664
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,630
Yeah.
No,

665
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,990
no,
I didn't think so.

666
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,230
When you say things like Nice.
Yeah.

667
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,750
Nice.

668
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,060
Anyway,
so you're there for 90 days?

669
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,150
Yeah.
I'm not telling my family when I'm going

670
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:08,890
through,
I'm not because I don't want to create a

671
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:13,891
bad situation with the church.
Like how crazy is that reviewing these 

672
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:16,030
papers,
I'm admitting my crimes.

673
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,570
I'm saying maybe I do.
Maybe I do.

674
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,380
Maybe I didn't see what I saw.
These people that you're meeting with in

675
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:28,381
Florida,
they assign you a person but you hadn't 

676
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:31,891
met them previously.
So just some person with paperwork and 

677
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:32,590
they're going over your.
Well they have you on the meter.

678
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:37,591
They have you on the lie detector test.
I mean on the line with the cans that 

679
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:37,591
you're talking about.
Yeah.

680
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:41,890
Yeah.
You're in a room that's locked and 

681
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:41,890
nothing doesn't do anything right that 
the meter.

682
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,580
Well,
it does something.

683
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:47,581
I don't exactly.
I mean there is an actual explanation 

684
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:47,581
for it in the real world.

685
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:49,660
I'm not smart enough to,
to retell it to you,

686
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:54,661
but uh,
if I was to have a meter here and you 

687
00:31:54,661 --> 00:31:58,051
had a thought I could show you,
it does register that you thought 

688
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:01,021
something but you can't really 
differentiate what those thoughts are 

689
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:02,620
not but as.
But as someone who trains in scientology

690
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,560
all you're trained to do,
which what I was doing,

691
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:10,561
I was training to administer scientology
to people was learning to do that and I 

692
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,970
would learn to say,
Joe,

693
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,220
what was that thought?
What was that thought?

694
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:20,310
I don't know what you're thinking,
but I just know that you had a thought 

695
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,070
and so I ask you a question and then I 
look at the meter to see that it 

696
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,390
registered on the meter and regardless 
of what you want to talk about,

697
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,700
we're only going to talk about what I 
see on the meter.

698
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,910
And then there's also,
it's open to suggestion,

699
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:31,810
right?
You could say,

700
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:36,930
is this a moment where you had doubt?
Is this a moment where you were angry 

701
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:36,930
and then the person has to think,
wow,

702
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,780
was it?
Yeah.

703
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,230
And they start convincing you.
Correct.

704
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,490
Well,
the first thing they do is they.

705
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,760
You need some of your discussing coconut
water or no,

706
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,490
you liked that said are atrocious.
You loved it.

707
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,210
I didn't love it.
I also didn't love your coffee drink,

708
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,810
but I'm sure their sponsors.
I loved everything you had joe,

709
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,350
that this natural stuff you didn't like 
everybody.

710
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,560
Everything needs a minute.
There's no sugar.

711
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,570
Wow.
It's pure taste.

712
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:06,020
The bean you like pure,
pure.

713
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,160
So after this 90 days of being there,
90 days of being stuck in this,

714
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,000
I mean it must be like a management 
believe that I was really,

715
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,350
really,
really messed up.

716
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:26,410
I would imagine too that they have 
probably a pretty grand establishment 

717
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:26,410
and clearwater,
right?

718
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:31,030
It's probably intimidating.
Like that's how a lot of cults and 

719
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,830
religions like to rocket it didn't go to
a like a pretty big place.

720
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,160
It's a huge place,
but if you're raised in it and you know 

721
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,160
you're,
you're very familiar with it,

722
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,991
but it is when you realize your position
in the church takes a backseat to the 

723
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:54,161
leader and Tom Cruise,
you realized that that was scary to me 

724
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:55,820
because it was against everything you've
been taught.

725
00:33:55,821 --> 00:34:00,821
Everything I've been taught,
everything that had been taught is that 

726
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,510
everyone is some sort of a spiritual 
being and everyone's equal and then your

727
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:07,511
whole goal as scientologists act for the
greater good of mankind and sort of 

728
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:09,770
bring as many people into this as you 
can because you're going to help them.

729
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,860
Right?
Because it wasn't ever going to get 

730
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:14,860
somebody in because I want to screw with
their lines up.

731
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,840
It was always,
I want to get this person in because I 

732
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,751
want them to be happy.
I want them to contribute to what we're 

733
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:25,961
doing.
Now is the thought process that Tom 

734
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:28,780
Cruise being this huge celebrity 
worldwide figure that it's very 

735
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:32,390
important to keep him happy and he 
probably.

736
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:37,391
The main goal of scientology is to keep 
tom what our ego boost that must be for 

737
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:38,050
him.
Oh,

738
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,970
will see a.
That is something that,

739
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,370
that people say all the time to me like 
why is that pot where men,

740
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,580
that ashtray.
Oh yeah,

741
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:48,380
definitely.
No Joe,

742
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:49,730
do you know that I've noticed smoked 
pot.

743
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,290
Oh you should definitely try it right 
now.

744
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,850
I'm scared.
Oh you should be.

745
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,110
Why?
What would happen?

746
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:56,690
Cause you to start freaking out thinking
about all sorts of stuff.

747
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,770
Yeah.
And so you just keep it dirty like that.

748
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:02,030
The Ashtray.
What do you mean?

749
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,460
Why don't you make it nice?
Why don't you presented in like,

750
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,260
man,
this is my man cave.

751
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,700
Men will give a fuck about.
Nice.

752
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:13,250
Yeah.
Well actually I shouldn't have been 

753
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,960
surprised hearing what I heard before he
started for you don't try to talk over 

754
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,270
each other because you know what I'm 
going to say you've never had.

755
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,770
No.
I would suggest like a little tiny 

756
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,631
amount for you just because somebody 
said something about gummy bears to me 

757
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:29,050
about,
you know,

758
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,710
Jesus,
don't fuck with those gummy bears.

759
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,190
Like powerful.
Those are horrendous.

760
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:35,600
So what happened?
Anything?

761
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,010
Yeah,
you're on a journey

762
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,650
on your life.
It'll give you extreme paranoia.

763
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,900
You'll start finding,
well it's not,

764
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:46,050
but when you come out of it it's very 
beneficial because you realize that it's

765
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:51,051
all bullshit and that you were nervous 
about some things that it just 

766
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:53,730
highlights your vulnerability that it 
takes your blinders away.

767
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,610
That doesn't sound like fun.
Well,

768
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:59,980
it's not necessarily that fun.
So you wouldn't do it again or.

769
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,300
I do it all the time.
The gummy gummy bears too.

770
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:06,270
I do them all the time.
You liked that feeling of being?

771
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,100
Yeah,
I think it's good for you.

772
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,720
I think it's good to be vulnerable.
That's good.

773
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,670
It's good to understand.
There's got to be vulnerable.

774
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,330
You're really just this finite organism 
floating through infinity,

775
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,170
you know?
I think,

776
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:18,140
but I feel that way without it.
Okay.

777
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,280
Well then you don't need it.
I mean it's all for everybody.

778
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:25,610
Oh Wow.
Kind of want to get to push it on me a 

779
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:25,890
little bit and you just gave up.
I think it benefits a lot of people.

780
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:30,891
It makes you more sensitive.
It gives you a better sense of 

781
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:30,891
community.
It makes you kinder.

782
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:31,440
I definitely that that.
Yeah.

783
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:31,920
Okay.
It,

784
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,050
it'll make you a,
a more.

785
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,820
Um,
I think it,

786
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,850
it makes you a more loving person.
I really believe that.

787
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:39,970
Yeah.
Okay.

788
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,670
Back to what you're saying.
Oh,

789
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,080
it makes sex feel better.
It makes food taste better.

790
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:49,090
Marry to a Puerto Rican food that you 
don't have a little shadow Puerto 

791
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,700
Ricans.
They do not have sex.

792
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:55,480
I can tell you that.
All of them,

793
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,290
I shouldn't say they,
like I've only had sex with one of them.

794
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,990
I'm the celebrity.
Uh,

795
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,340
we all know there's treatment.
Different treatment celebrities.

796
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,000
Well,
especially in scientology,

797
00:37:10,001 --> 00:37:10,890
right?
No,

798
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:16,070
it's highlighted.
It is like nothing you could ever 

799
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,921
imagine it is.
So when people say Tom doesn't leave 

800
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:20,920
because they have information on him or 
John,

801
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:25,921
that's not the reason.
The amount of power they receive from 

802
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:28,180
this church is like nothing in 
Hollywood.

803
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:33,210
It is like nothing.
There is no reason for them to leave 

804
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:33,640
this environment.

805
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Right.
So it's super beneficial for them to be 

806
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:38,840
attached to it.
Correct it as employees,

807
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,251
they work for them.
All these people will take care of his 

808
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:43,251
every need.

809
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:46,960
Yes.
And there's a policy on how to talk to 

810
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,430
somebody like you wouldn't say,
I'm like,

811
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:53,870
if you said go get me a go get me a 
coffee and I wanted this temperature,

812
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,820
there's no,
I can't get it.

813
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:57,410
We're five miles from any,
you know,

814
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,900
we're 30,
there'll be none of that kind of talk.

815
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:04,640
Like not any policy about don't you 
don't talk back like ever.

816
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,880
You don't step out of line,
you don't give an opinion,

817
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:10,190
you don't make a face,
you don't make a gesture,

818
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:15,191
you don't see if you step out of line in
any way you are dealt with by the 

819
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:21,881
church.
So we spent essentially has servants 

820
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:21,881
correct.
How many people?

821
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,960
Like a lot.
A Lot,

822
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,070
a lot.
And by the way,

823
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:30,071
I don't begrudge.
Somebody would have staff like if you 

824
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:30,071
can have it,
I go do it all day,

825
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:30,200
all night.
Do it all day,

826
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,190
all night.
But when you believe as a scientologist,

827
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:36,310
you are working for somebody

828
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:41,370
who single handedly is saving the planet
and you deserve that kind of punishment.

829
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,930
That's something different.
Babe.

830
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,030
You understand what?
Like that?

831
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,860
That's a,
it's an abuse that is not justified,

832
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:55,861
but it is justified because you believe 
that you are single handedly saving the 

833
00:38:56,891 --> 00:39:00,300
planet Capeesh Yeah.
No,

834
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,090
I get it.
I get it.

835
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,410
So,
um,

836
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,770
so he's the main figurehead.
He's the main guy,

837
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:07,150
like right up with ms dot savage.
Right.

838
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,340
And then John Travolta somewhere in 
that,

839
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,270
I think John was given what a,
a designation called Pecan where the 

840
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,550
con,
not con,

841
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,320
Con k,
h a k,

842
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:28,040
h a n Kokona.
He's given this designation of cocoon,

843
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,410
which there's a policy that basically 
says you can kill another human being if

844
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,720
you were conned,
you're going to look the other way.

845
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,820
And he was given.
He was given that by Eldorado Hubbard.

846
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:41,340
Don't we laugh because you don't make me
go.

847
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,240
Please don't make me laugh.
Don't laugh.

848
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,480
Sometimes you work on a car because 
first of all,

849
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,300
not very well.
Do you have any takes?

850
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:52,030
I ruined because of Kevin Goes,
don't don't ruin this.

851
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:52,520
Take.
I go,

852
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,530
no,
don't tell him you're going to do with 

853
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:57,530
that.
Then I would ruin a gel because he,

854
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,770
he would do some stupid shit with his 
hands or something that he never 

855
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,220
rehearsed.
That would make me cry from laughter.

856
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Yes,
and he was really highly inappropriate 

857
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,160
and moments that made me pee almost.
Yeah.

858
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,590
He's allowed to kill people.
I don't know.

859
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,150
I don't.
I should look at the policy again.

860
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:17,520
I don't want to us,
we got to put.

861
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,440
You're supposed to look the other way.
So like if somebody said something wrong

862
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:23,260
to John Travolta,
Samurai sword and cut their head off,

863
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:25,720
you just got clean up the body.
He just got to clean up and because it's

864
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:30,721
called,
it's called ethics protection and 

865
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,560
responsible for dealing with it,
dealing with it.

866
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,440
Just leave the room and he would know 
that you guys would take care of it.

867
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,660
Then there's also another policy,
and by the way,

868
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,740
the reason why I say these policies is 
because I don't like when people say,

869
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:42,670
Lee,
I believe you.

870
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:44,800
I don't want you to believe me.
I want you to look it up.

871
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,560
I want you to look for yourself and make
your own decisions.

872
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:51,730
So I keep quoting these policies because
I want people to look it up so that they

873
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:53,170
can say,
that Shit's true.

874
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:54,730
She's not talking shit.
You know what I mean?

875
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,210
Um,
there's another policy called ethics 

876
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,981
protection.
There's another policy called the 

877
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:02,200
responsibility,
the responsibility of leaders,

878
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,560
which he actually says exactly what you 
just said,

879
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,160
that,
uh,

880
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,590
basically,
you know,

881
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,930
what you gotta do to protect a leader.
You got to do it.

882
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:15,931
If you see a body,
then you clean it up and the leader 

883
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,151
should never know.
I read going clear by Lawrence Wright 

884
00:41:18,151 --> 00:41:20,890
and I watched the HBO special on it and 
um,

885
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,140
it's,
it's stunning,

886
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,210
crazy,
accurate,

887
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:28,450
crazy accurate,
and was blown away the book,

888
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,770
especially the book goes into great 
depth about how bananas,

889
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,070
l,
Ron Hubbard

890
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,320
was right?
And it's just,

891
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:41,350
it's so odd to me that this.
All this information is out there.

892
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,880
Isn't out there though.
Remember,

893
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:46,430
you're reading l Ron Hubbard words from 
dianetics.

894
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,710
Write the book one.
It says,

895
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,200
the first book that we're all required 
to read.

896
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:55,300
Everybody's required to read everything 
that he's written.

897
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,320
I wrote dynamics to have you sent to me.
Yeah,

898
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:58,770
I got it.
I ordered it.

899
00:41:58,771 --> 00:42:01,700
It was one of those late night 
infomercial things when I first moved to

900
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:05,000
La.
I've always been into a self help,

901
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,330
self help selling Anthony Robbins.
I bought all his tapes.

902
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:12,550
I used to listen to it on a Walkman back
in the day and read his books and I,

903
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,390
I,
you know,

904
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:15,500
so I thought it was just more of that 
and uh,

905
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,760
I got put on a list and I got sent 
invitations out for years,

906
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,130
for years.
I bet you,

907
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,830
I swear I'm actually willing to make 
them money.

908
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,510
Bet that you get mail after we talk.
Hm,

909
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,490
interesting.
Yeah.

910
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Well I went to one of those things where
you sit down and you get an eater and 

911
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,210
you hold the thing and the guy asks you 
questions.

912
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,630
Oh yeah.
San Diego.

913
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:36,580
And I was filming some.
Oh,

914
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,470
so you saw the say they did a 
demonstration.

915
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,580
Did you see it read on the meter?
Like the pinch test?

916
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,870
Well the,
no,

917
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:46,310
I didn't,
I don't remember a pinch test,

918
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:51,311
but I do remember holding onto these 
things and he would ask me some 

919
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:53,741
questions,
but the guy was very uninterested or 

920
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:57,070
disinterested.
He just seemed like he was kind of like 

921
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,561
being forced to do it.
That's was just going through the 

922
00:42:59,561 --> 00:42:59,561
motions.
He seemed super bored.

923
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,610
Oh,
I wonder,

924
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:04,850
had he not been super bored?
What'd you be full on right now?

925
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,330
No,
no,

926
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:05,810
no.
I was,

927
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,920
I was doing it as a goof.

928
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,830
It was only like 10 years ago.
I thought it was ridiculous.

929
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:13,880
I was in San Diego filming something and
they had this setup out there outside.

930
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:14,330
I'm like,
Ooh,

931
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:19,331
let me go in there.
And I was just hoping I could weasel in 

932
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:19,380
and have a seat and nobody would know 
who I am.

933
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,470
I put on the cans and they.
No,

934
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,190
no,
no,

935
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,290
I don't think so.
I think I didn't give a fuck.

936
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,380
He seen very,
you know,

937
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:32,330
a welcoming and loving because they 
remember they do believe in what they're

938
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:33,290
doing.
I did.

939
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,100
But anyway,
what I was saying to you is the dynamics

940
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:38,440
and dynamics.
You know,

941
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,090
Elbert Hubbard is writing that he's a 
scientist,

942
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:45,260
he's a decorated war hero,
um,

943
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,700
that he was a college educated and so 
you're not,

944
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:51,350
you're saying the information is out 
there.

945
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,800
What information other than what we're 
reading is out there now look more like,

946
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,130
but no scientologists allowed to read 
Lawrence Wright's book.

947
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,500
It's not allowed to.
So they did an excellent job of 

948
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,800
insulating people if uh,
you and I were like friends,

949
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:10,430
friends.
Right.

950
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:14,210
And you had concern for me in St log and
you came and you said,

951
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,370
Leah,
I really am scared for you.

952
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,160
You know what I'm right.
I've read going clear and I want to know

953
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:20,720
that you're okay.
And you and Andrew's like,

954
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,030
I dunno if this is good thing for your 
daughter,

955
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,860
you know,
I would say joe,

956
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,750
you know me,
I'm a good person.

957
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,700
Like I've been there for you.
You're white.

958
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,870
Like come on,
you know,

959
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:30,920
I don't,
I don't do drawing.

960
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:31,320
I,
you're not,

961
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:32,190
you know,
I don't steal.

962
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,190
I'm doing just respect the fact that 
this is something I believe is helping 

963
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:41,301
me.
Why would you ask me to look at 

964
00:44:41,301 --> 00:44:42,240
something that's anti my church or anti 
what I'm doing?

965
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,620
Or you would approach it,
but.

966
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:45,300
And you would accept a Joe,
you'd be like,

967
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:50,301
she's right.
It is messed up of me to be telling her 

968
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:50,910
these things when she is a good person 
and hernia.

969
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:51,570
Angelo.
Great.

970
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:54,240
Like you wouldn't.
You wouldn't push it.

971
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:59,270
You wouldn't push it.
You would respect me enough because you 

972
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,030
would know me enough to go.
Then I want to do that to her.

973
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,500
It's wrong.
It's disrespectful.

974
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,540
So you feel like that happens pretty 
much across the board?

975
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,000
Well,
when I was outside,

976
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:06,890
yes.
Yes.

977
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,220
Well that's what you're trained to do.
So you're working constantly with people

978
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:13,860
that are not in the church.
Your assets.

979
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,890
How many people are going to come up to 
you and say,

980
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,900
Hey,
what I think you're.

981
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,040
I think you're in a cult.
Well,

982
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:20,250
in your position.
Very few,

983
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,780
right?
Because you were wanting to stars of the

984
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:24,780
show and everyone will do that from time
to time.

985
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:25,640
Quite a few,
right?

986
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:26,970
Very few.
None.

987
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,930
None.
Yeah,

988
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,940
none.
So when he's on a set,

989
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,390
is it all like he's doing mission 
impossible shrimp like that?

990
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,210
Is it all scientology employees that are
constantly surrounding him?

991
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,240
Yes.
So he's got like this wall of 

992
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:41,240
installation,
correct?

993
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:41,240
It's all scientology people.
Correct.

994
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,260
But the director,
the writer,

995
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:44,760
the producer,
they don't have to be scientologists.

996
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:45,540
Not at all.
No.

997
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,500
No,
but they're not.

998
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:50,370
They're not invading Tom Space.
They're not going to be disrespectful to

999
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:55,371
their lead actor.
They're not going to go up to tom and 

1000
00:45:55,371 --> 00:45:55,371
go,
hey tom,

1001
00:45:55,371 --> 00:45:58,761
we,
we don't know that our affiliation with 

1002
00:45:58,761 --> 00:45:59,940
you and what you're doing.
And the scientology thing,

1003
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:01,530
you know,
they're not gonna rock the boat.

1004
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:06,570
They hired him as an actor and because 
of the way Tom Cruise is,

1005
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:07,440
man,
I don't know,

1006
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:12,460
I'm obviously,
but what I get out of him as he's just 

1007
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:12,460
super focused,
like very intense,

1008
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:17,060
turned on intense guy and it probably 
benefits him having all these servants 

1009
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:22,191
take care of all his every need so we 
could focus directly on his thing and 

1010
00:46:22,191 --> 00:46:26,061
just go for it.
So for him it's probably 100 percent 

1011
00:46:26,061 --> 00:46:26,370
beneficial to be involved.
Correct.

1012
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,430
Because it is,
it is a world that's tailor made to him 

1013
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,950
and that,
and that is,

1014
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,550
is,
is scientology a what,

1015
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:36,000
a rare position.
Yes.

1016
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:41,001
It is for any human to ever find 
themselves in without like being like 

1017
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:41,460
the conqueror of a country or something 
like that right now.

1018
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,240
Correct.
I mean,

1019
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,940
again,
I want to make the distinction between,

1020
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:45,900
you know,
listen,

1021
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,810
when you gained some success in this 
business thing,

1022
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:50,970
God,
you're able to surround yourself with an

1023
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:55,971
assistant and people to help you to make
your life easier so you could focus on 

1024
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:57,280
your work.
Um,

1025
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,470
but this is something totally different 
because behind closed doors,

1026
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,270
uh,
you are,

1027
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,700
uh,
acting and being a different way and you

1028
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:06,060
know,
it,

1029
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:11,570
I know it,
he knows it and anybody in scientology 

1030
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,420
knows it.
And that's why it is a,

1031
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,840
it is about the mission of scientology.
So anything is justified.

1032
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,270
So behind closed doors though,
how is he different?

1033
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:23,070
It is nothing out align.
Nothing.

1034
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,790
Um,
nothing that would upset him.

1035
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,610
Um,
you,

1036
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,310
you have act and be a certain

1037
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,170
way around him.
You cannot,

1038
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,260
um,
you just can't step out of line out of 

1039
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,141
the bounds of the policies of the church
and you or you will be dealt with and 

1040
00:47:40,141 --> 00:47:42,120
you will be dealt with swiftly,
uh,

1041
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,160
within your church.
And that seems to be quite abusive to 

1042
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,500
me.
I was punished for a,

1043
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:55,620
basically following my own policy of my 
church defending my church and I can't 

1044
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:58,420
be friends with somebody who you can't 
be around,

1045
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:03,421
that.
You can be around that and you're 

1046
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:03,421
getting punished by your church because 
of it.

1047
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:03,820
Um,
but that again,

1048
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:05,920
that wasn't really even the reason why I
left.

1049
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,600
I mean,
I was dealing with that.

1050
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:10,360
I was dealing with being interrogated at
my expense.

1051
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:15,361
We're talking hundreds of thousands of 
dollars and you've given us millions of 

1052
00:48:15,361 --> 00:48:15,361
dollars.
Millions,

1053
00:48:15,361 --> 00:48:18,310
yes.
Million and now they're turning around.

1054
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,560
You know,
they have these hate websites they 

1055
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,591
create on everybody within minutes and 
inquiry and they can't really say 

1056
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:28,210
anything.

1057
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,700
He didn't do anything to say a lot.
Listen,

1058
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,330
listen,
I said to Joe,

1059
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,860
I said it in my book.
Okay.

1060
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:34,090
Yeah,
I'm all those things.

1061
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:35,170
Okay.
You even,

1062
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:36,910
if you catch me,
you know,

1063
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,120
in a situation or my husband,
it wouldn't change anything about what 

1064
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,870
I'm saying.
It wouldn't change a damn thing.

1065
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,750
It doesn't matter what their intention 
is to try to,

1066
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:52,170
you know,
my husband sometimes sings in a salsa 

1067
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,091
club.
You don't think they're going to catch 

1068
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:54,091
him with a girl somewhere dancing 
innocently.

1069
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:55,270
You know what I'm saying?
That is yes,

1070
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:58,390
you can do all those things.
You can hire Pi to follow us.

1071
00:48:58,391 --> 00:49:03,391
You can get us in situations.
But does that change anything trying to 

1072
00:49:03,391 --> 00:49:05,200
discredit you?
And it doesn't matter what you're saying

1073
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:06,460
is true.
Exactly.

1074
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,680
And it's not just me.
I'm not saying it.

1075
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,290
The other thing that bothers me is that 
it's become my crusades.

1076
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:15,550
Say it's not my crusade,
it's my responsibility.

1077
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:21,030
And I feel other people need to step up 
and take some responsibility.

1078
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,370
I don't want to be the only one saying 
it.

1079
00:49:25,371 --> 00:49:28,180
I don't want to be other people,
other actors,

1080
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:29,340
other,
uh,

1081
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,990
officials,
the media,

1082
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,000
uh,
they need to not make it about me.

1083
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,370
Get some bowls and say what you really 
think.

1084
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,400
Like I was on 20 slash 20 right with Dan
Harris and it's the parent company to a 

1085
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,290
and a and I,
I,

1086
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:46,960
I did the show for somebody else and,
and Dan Harris.

1087
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:48,190
I said,
what do you think of that?

1088
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,630
Like,
what do you think of Dan?

1089
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:51,190
And he said,
I have to be impartial.

1090
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:56,910
And I said,
would you be impartial about abuse or 

1091
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,510
you impartial about this?
And I named a few things and he went,

1092
00:49:58,511 --> 00:49:59,140
well,
no.

1093
00:49:59,141 --> 00:49:59,860
And I said,
right,

1094
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,180
okay,
you're being an asshole.

1095
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,540
And you know,
the truth of the matter is,

1096
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,060
I do think that of,
of this industry,

1097
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:12,061
I think this is like a bolus industry 
and there's people who have some bowls 

1098
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,920
like you,
like Adam Corolla,

1099
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:19,950
you know,
there's a few people who are in the 

1100
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:20,500
public eye,
I'm sorry about that,

1101
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:25,740
who are in the public eye,
that have had the balls to have an 

1102
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:25,740
opinion,
don't make it about me.

1103
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,980
These things are screwed up.
These people's

1104
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,890
lives are being hurt and damage and 
you're in,

1105
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:35,891
you're defrauding people at a millions 
of dollars by your abusive policies.

1106
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:38,510
You're,
you can make things confidential.

1107
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:40,550
Then you say,
these policies don't exist.

1108
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,640
Why don't you say they exist there.
You can google them and see that they 

1109
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,421
exist,
but in their defense is a magnet because

1110
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:55,541
you are a famous person and so it makes 
it much easier to concentrate on the 

1111
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:58,480
whole situation through you.
Right?

1112
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,480
Because of the fact that you're a famous
person because of the fact that you 

1113
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,990
lived most of your life in the church.
It makes it very convenient to go 

1114
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:12,581
through you.
I don't necessarily think it's a bad 

1115
00:51:12,581 --> 00:51:12,581
thing.
I guess what I'm saying,

1116
00:51:12,581 --> 00:51:14,260
if I say this connection as a policy.
Right,

1117
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:19,270
right.
And they sit and then the next headline 

1118
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,060
is Leah Remini alleges that 
disconnection.

1119
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:21,650
Don't know.
I'm not alleging anything.

1120
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,880
Look it up.
Right.

1121
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,660
I see what you're saying.
Right.

1122
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,100
Don't say that I'm saying it.
They're protecting themselves legally.

1123
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:29,240
Probably.
That's right.

1124
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:29,870
It's,
it's,

1125
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:34,871
it's available for anyone to see what,
because they probably don't want to get 

1126
00:51:34,871 --> 00:51:36,020
sued if they get sued.
It's in their policies.

1127
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,240
Uh,
that's a good question.

1128
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,300
And maybe they would say that they were 
misinterpreting it or disconnection and 

1129
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:48,221
suppressives and it says exactly what 
the church labels a suppressive person 

1130
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,380
that you are only your only option is to
disconnect.

1131
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,460
So you have children disconnecting from 
their own mothers and fathers.

1132
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,670
That was one of the most disturbing 
aspects of your show to see the damage 

1133
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:04,250
that caused and see how devastated these
parents were and family members were.

1134
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:06,480
That's horrible.
That's really horrible.

1135
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:11,750
And you know what people say,
you knew the policy existed right when 

1136
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,310
you were in scientology.
So why you guys so surprise?

1137
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:19,090
We were taught a suppressive person is 
like an evil with horns like Hitler.

1138
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,320
You're not thinking it's my mother,
my daughter,

1139
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,220
but when you get pulled in for something
like this,

1140
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,160
which is what they did in the end,
they try to get me to disconnect from my

1141
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:36,161
stepfather.
Then they tried to get my stepfather to 

1142
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,771
disconnect from my mother.
And so they did this whole thing with 

1143
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:38,771
her stepfather.
Who brought you in the first place?

1144
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:38,771
No,
no.

1145
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:40,760
This is another guy.
Another grandmother visit.

1146
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:41,660
Yeah.
Just getting crazy.

1147
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:42,840
Yeah.
Um,

1148
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,420
yeah.
She's a naughty naughty,

1149
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,940
but she's been,
she's been married to George,

1150
00:52:46,941 --> 00:52:47,610
my,
my,

1151
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,690
um,
her husband for 30 years.

1152
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:52,010
So,
um,

1153
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:52,400
yeah,
no,

1154
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:56,050
the other guy ended up leaving us there.
He got us into scientology.

1155
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,460
Then he took off.
Oh,

1156
00:52:58,461 --> 00:52:59,600
Jesus.
Yeah.

1157
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,460
So talk me through your return.
So you go to Florida,

1158
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,990
you spend three fucking months getting 
grilled everyday,

1159
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:15,130
putting the pressure on you.
And that's been a proven tactic of 

1160
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:18,820
interrogations that it's always 
questioned by people that really like 

1161
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:22,760
look at the ethical implications of 
interrogation.

1162
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,070
The problem is when you put so much 
intention on

1163
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,160
someone about a certain thing,
it makes them so uncomfortable that it 

1164
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,000
changes their perception of things to 
the point where they're willing to admit

1165
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,860
a lot of things that may or may not be 
true.

1166
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,150
Just to get the interrogation.

1167
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,180
Well,
that's what I did.

1168
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:37,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

1169
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,620
I just said,
okay,

1170
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,600
I'm sorry.
So you come back.

1171
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:45,660
I come back.
I kind of like take a little bit of a 

1172
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,030
hiatus from scientology,
but I'm not creating.

1173
00:53:46,031 --> 00:53:46,300
Wait,

1174
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,910
when you say take a hiatus,
you're not doing the daily thing

1175
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,570
going in all the time.
How often are you going in then?

1176
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:55,110
Um,
maybe like once every month.

1177
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,450
Once a month instead of every day.
That's a big deal.

1178
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,310
It was a big deal.
Then they got me back.

1179
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,590
Then they have a big meeting with me and
they go,

1180
00:54:01,591 --> 00:54:04,380
we want you to come back.
We know you're upset.

1181
00:54:04,381 --> 00:54:06,120
Like that whole thing was just screwed 
up.

1182
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:08,310
Let's just come back and I wanted 
specifics.

1183
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:13,311
What was messed up?
I want you to tell me in writing and 

1184
00:54:13,311 --> 00:54:14,940
then you should also refund all my money
that you spent,

1185
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:19,941
that I spent having to do this.
Then they showed me a policy that there 

1186
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:23,661
are no refunds and if I ask for a refund
then I'm going to get declared a 

1187
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:27,561
suppressive person.
And so the money that you spent going 

1188
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:28,920
Florida and spending three months down 
there,

1189
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:30,210
that's what you wanted to refund.

1190
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,550
Correct?
I want that money.

1191
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,730
Millions that you gave to them over 
because listen in in,

1192
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:36,120
in a,
in their defense,

1193
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:41,121
I don't think it's right to get your 
money back on something that you feel 

1194
00:54:41,121 --> 00:54:41,121
you've received,
right?

1195
00:54:41,121 --> 00:54:45,040
A service you've received.
Problem that I have is scientology is a 

1196
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,860
pay before you go proposition.
There are,

1197
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:52,550
if not tens of thousands of people who 
have money sitting on account that they 

1198
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:54,270
can't get because they have a refund 
policy.

1199
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:59,630
I can't,
I can't just call the church right now 

1200
00:54:59,630 --> 00:54:59,970
and say I want a refund because they're 
not allowed to talk to me.

1201
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,240
So it's a catch 22.
So you're only person that you could 

1202
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,060
talk to in the church is the person who 
deals with refunds,

1203
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:08,700
but they can't talk to you because 
you're declared an enemy to the church.

1204
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:14,330
So they're holding millions and millions
of dollars of people's money that they 

1205
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:19,941
can't get back because no lawyer is 
going to take on the Church of 

1206
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:24,470
Scientology for free.
But you're talking to the average guy 

1207
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:25,410
who has fifty thousand one hundred 
thousand dollars on account.

1208
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,060
He or she is never gonna.
See again.

1209
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,950
So you come back,
you,

1210
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:29,930
you,
um,

1211
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:30,390
you,

1212
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,710
you get to them,
they have this meeting with you.

1213
00:55:32,711 --> 00:55:34,330
You say that you want to get your money 
back,

1214
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,640
they won't give you your money back.
And then how does it go from there?

1215
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,520
Uh,
they said,

1216
00:55:37,521 --> 00:55:38,200
you know,
you,

1217
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:43,270
you're going to be interrogated because 
you are now acting as an enemy to the 

1218
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,780
church because you were asking for your 
money back.

1219
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,780
That's a bad sign.
Then I said,

1220
00:55:47,781 --> 00:55:52,781
okay,
now it just kind of out opened up a 

1221
00:55:52,781 --> 00:55:52,820
little bit of a wound.
Then I started saying where shelly,

1222
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,400
okay,
now I want an answer where shelly is,

1223
00:55:55,401 --> 00:55:58,160
because I had been writing her shelly 
miscavige correct,

1224
00:55:58,161 --> 00:55:59,520
the leader's wife and I said,
I,

1225
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:04,750
it's,
it's gonna get bad for you guys because 

1226
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,391
now I started going on the Internet and 
I started seeing stories of senior 

1227
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:11,561
executives getting beaten in the church,
like Debbie Cook and Mike Rinder and Tom

1228
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:17,411
devopped and I was seeing all these 
names and I was eating that they were 

1229
00:56:17,411 --> 00:56:19,370
actually beaten,
physically beaten and for what reason?

1230
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:24,220
For looking the wrong way at David 
miscavige for signing,

1231
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,920
for siding,
for rolling their eyes,

1232
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:31,950
for being tired for like yawning in 
front of them or something.

1233
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,820
Yes.
So someone beats you,

1234
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,510
right?
Or has or he has somebody beat you.

1235
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,240
And Mike Rinder and Marty Rathbun.
We're part of that right foot.

1236
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:48,300
We're part of that senior executive 
strata that was up in Riverside county 

1237
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:48,300
where they have,
um,

1238
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,980
a place called gold gold base and that's
where these incidents were allegedly 

1239
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,810
taking place.
Um,

1240
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:00,220
so I started googling it and I started 
going into the church and saying,

1241
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:05,221
I'm googling this information and I want
to know why these people are saying the 

1242
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,930
same thing and the stories are over and 
over again.

1243
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,610
And then I'm seeing stories of families 
being declared suppressive people,

1244
00:57:12,611 --> 00:57:13,550
Their Ota.
It's,

1245
00:57:13,551 --> 00:57:18,551
you know,
they're high up in the church and their 

1246
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:18,551
families are being forced.
And then you're,

1247
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:19,730
then you're presented with,
um,

1248
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,820
this is a lie.
Look Martin,

1249
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,110
Mike,
Mike,

1250
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:25,720
Render admitted that he beat people and 
Mardi Gras.

1251
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,040
I said,
but that's the difference.

1252
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,520
They're admitting it.
They are admitting that they did this 

1253
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,881
under David miscavige's direction.
You are saying that they're lying,

1254
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,220
but they're not lying about they're 
doing it,

1255
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,800
but they're lying about having received 
it.

1256
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,860
Does that make sense to you?
Um,

1257
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,550
you know,
over and over again,

1258
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:48,070
these stories kept coming up and they 
kept.

1259
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:51,130
When I would ask a question,
they would put me in a room and go,

1260
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:52,900
what are your crimes?
Who are you talking to?

1261
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:54,730
Why you talking to enemies of your 
church?

1262
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,440
And it was just at my questions were 
never answered and I said,

1263
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,550
so does this church ever do anything 
wrong?

1264
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:05,500
Does this church ever do anything wrong?
Is everybody an evil asshole?

1265
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:07,840
Once they leave,
is that what you're telling me?

1266
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,870
So what would happen if you said that my
mother was.

1267
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:16,140
Then I just got to believe you that my 
mother is an evil person and all these 

1268
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,650
horrible things you're saying about my 
mother.

1269
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:21,160
I was supposed to believe you,
and the answer was don't believe me.

1270
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:22,640
Believe l,
what is Ellroy?

1271
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,480
What is elevated?
Say and then they have the policy out.

1272
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:26,740
What does elevate.
You say,

1273
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:28,540
read this.
Read this aloud.

1274
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,910
What don't you understand?
What does this word mean?

1275
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,500
What does that word mean?
Go look this up.

1276
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:36,250
You haven't a misunderstood word here.
If you don't understand that anybody who

1277
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:41,251
attacks your church is a criminal,
like this is the kind of thing you go 

1278
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:46,051
through.
So this is what you're going through 

1279
00:58:46,051 --> 00:58:46,051
when he came back to La,
when you slowly started separating.

1280
00:58:46,051 --> 00:58:51,030
Yes.
Did they ever give you one of those big 

1281
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,030
gold metals like Tom Cruise?
Got.

1282
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:54,270
I never got one,
but I did get a huge award for donating 

1283
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,720
another million to church.
And,

1284
00:58:56,721 --> 00:58:57,370
and,
and it's,

1285
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:02,510
it's so crazy to me that everybody who 
leaves is somebody who has an ax to 

1286
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:03,840
grind,
apostate,

1287
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,590
a bigot because I've been called a 
bigot.

1288
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,330
Um,
because they,

1289
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,460
they,
they go to the one place you can go to,

1290
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:13,810
which is don't,
don't disrespect my religious beliefs,

1291
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,670
right?
And then they can call you a bigot.

1292
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,090
I'm for religious freedom.
Um,

1293
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:19,600
for the first segment like that.
That's what they're hiding behind.

1294
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:22,430
And I'm calling bullshit every celebrity

1295
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,430
who says that shit because they know 
what they're doing.

1296
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:27,770
I did it too.
I did a to Joe.

1297
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:32,420
So I know what they're doing and they 
know that I know will just even sicker.

1298
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,170
You're a terrible person have against 
you on this.

1299
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,180
Why?
Because you're so fiery and you,

1300
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:38,660
you,
you,

1301
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:42,970
you enjoy this combat.
There's part of you that enjoys it.

1302
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:44,780
Yeah.
That's what I thought about this,

1303
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,520
when the whole thing first started going
down,

1304
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,690
I was like,
oh,

1305
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:52,691
she's a terrible person to like to leave
the church because she's going to talk 

1306
00:59:52,691 --> 00:59:55,790
shit to the under time.
I don't mean it in a bad way if you told

1307
00:59:55,791 --> 01:00:00,791
me tomorrow and I,
and I really just getting to know you 

1308
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:00,791
today.
I,

1309
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:01,760
I mean I've known you but we don't know 
know each other,

1310
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,550
but I'm really,
I kind of like you,

1311
01:00:04,551 --> 01:00:05,720
like,
you're cool.

1312
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,150
Thank you.
Can you smile with your eyes?

1313
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:09,740
Which is a thing that I loved about 
Kevin.

1314
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,510
Like that was the one thing I'd say 
about Kevin.

1315
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:13,670
Like there's like a smile,
like behind their eyes,

1316
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:16,520
like there's a smile.
I always find that to be kind.

1317
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:21,550
Now you could be a total dick and I 
don't know about it because I don't 

1318
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:21,550
listen to podcasts.
Okay.

1319
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:22,360
But are you a dick?
No.

1320
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:22,820
Okay,
good.

1321
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:28,090
Um,
because if I hear like when I leave 

1322
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:28,090
here,
Joe was a total fuck.

1323
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:29,540
You probably hear that from one person 
or two.

1324
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:31,370
Okay.
Okay.

1325
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:34,700
But here's the thing,
if you call me tomorrow and said,

1326
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,720
Oh,
I'm having a problem with my neighbor 

1327
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,810
because he said I'm encroaching on his 
property and my kids swing set is 

1328
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,530
incredibly.
I would be.

1329
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:49,670
So like I would be,
I would find every resource.

1330
01:00:49,671 --> 01:00:50,780
I could help you.

1331
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,520
That is who I am.
I,

1332
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:55,580
not that I'm mother Theresa.
I will get upset about I,

1333
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:58,850
if I see anything on the street I'm in,
I get involved in shit.

1334
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:01,190
I've always been involved in other 
people's business.

1335
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,320
Okay.
I,

1336
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,960
if I could see into your house,
I will lie on you.

1337
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:08,750
I will do.
If I go into your house,

1338
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:12,500
I'm looking in your drawers on the shit.
I'm in people's business all the time.

1339
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:17,560
And if I'm in a restaurant I tell Angelo
and speak to me because I want to hear 

1340
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:17,700
what's going on next to me.
You know?

1341
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,190
And I figure everything out.
Right?

1342
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:19,760
But,
but,

1343
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:24,850
but if I see people being bullied,
if I see people being unjustly hurt,

1344
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:28,360
yes I do.
I have always says.

1345
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,810
And people who know me know that's true.
Yeah.

1346
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,920
Well,
so this David miscavige wife situation 

1347
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,200
didn't get resolved.

1348
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,760
I filed a missing persons report with 
the LAPD.

1349
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:46,180
Um,
and then I found some pictures of the 

1350
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,780
guy who was in charge of my case 
speaking into scientology event on human

1351
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:49,540
trafficking.
Um,

1352
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:54,550
Lieutenant Dawson at the lapd police 
officer being paid to speak at this 

1353
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:59,630
celebrity center at a human trafficking 
event that celebrity center,

1354
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:04,631
Scientology.
That seems a massive conflict of 

1355
01:02:04,631 --> 01:02:04,631
interest.
Okay.

1356
01:02:04,631 --> 01:02:06,260
So then,
so then that's funny.

1357
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,830
So then,
uh,

1358
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:12,350
after that I called a that do all of a 
sudden lieutenant to us in and I said,

1359
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:17,351
so what's the deal?
Because I had given a letter with the 

1360
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:19,830
police report that said it was too 
shelly,

1361
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:21,540
if they found her,
shelly,

1362
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,090
go with this man.
Now I'm going to take care of you all.

1363
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:27,000
Take care of your legal fees.
What's going on there is wrong.

1364
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,970
You have no idea because let me tell you
said they have no telephone.

1365
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:33,270
They have no mail in or out.
They are not allowed to leave the base.

1366
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,430
If they leave that base of at Riverside 
County,

1367
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,760
they are accompanied by security or 
handler.

1368
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,690
So you think she's a prisoner?
Um,

1369
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:41,520
I,
I,

1370
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,160
if she's alive and well.
Uh,

1371
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,340
the second,
a best case scenario would be yes.

1372
01:02:47,341 --> 01:02:52,341
That she's being held prisoner,
if not by her own mind if she's alive 

1373
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:53,080
and well.
Right.

1374
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:58,120
So you did.
What didn't she released some sort of a 

1375
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:58,620
statement or someone?
Someone did.

1376
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:02,490
I don't know who was from to respond to 
your accusations,

1377
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:03,320
right?
They,

1378
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,420
they said that they had made contact 
with her and she didn't want to be 

1379
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:10,410
found.
I said,

1380
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:15,680
did you see her or was she speeding?
Was Somebody speaking on her behalf?

1381
01:03:15,731 --> 01:03:18,300
Are you ready for the answer that's 
classified?

1382
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,040
This is what the police said that I 
said,

1383
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:20,730
are you sick?

1384
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:21,420
I said,
Serosa.

1385
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:22,890
You say there's something wrong with 
you.

1386
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:25,820
Am I doing something wrong?
I filed the report.

1387
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:26,630
You know that,
right?

1388
01:03:26,631 --> 01:03:28,610
Like,
you know that I filed the report.

1389
01:03:28,611 --> 01:03:32,030
I thought maybe he was confused and he 
thought he was talking to my cousin.

1390
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,780
I said,
no.

1391
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:38,180
Like I filed the report.
Of course you're going to get me the 

1392
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:38,600
information I need to know if you saw 
her or the.

1393
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,910
The officers that you sent there saw 
her.

1394
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,700
Did anybody give her my note?
If it did you.

1395
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,500
Did they it?
Was she okay?

1396
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,420
Was she.
Did you take her off the base?

1397
01:03:47,421 --> 01:03:49,190
Did you say?
Do you want to speak to her alone?

1398
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:54,191
He said,
I can't give you any of that 

1399
01:03:54,191 --> 01:03:54,191
information.
Could you imagine?

1400
01:03:54,191 --> 01:03:54,650
Then I had to spend more money,
Joe,

1401
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:58,580
because this is not free.
I had to spend more money on a lawyer to

1402
01:03:58,581 --> 01:04:02,450
do a followup on the public information 
acts.

1403
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:05,480
I asked specific questions.
Who did you see?

1404
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,270
Did you see her?
Was she alone?

1405
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:10,400
Where did you see her?
What did she look like?

1406
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,050
Didn't give me any information.
They'd go,

1407
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:13,070
yeah,
you can get that information.

1408
01:04:13,071 --> 01:04:14,860
Who's paid to two more dollars?
Okay.

1409
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:17,930
With paid the two more dollars and then 
the thousands of dollars,

1410
01:04:17,931 --> 01:04:20,030
it costs me to get a lawyer to draft up 
the letter,

1411
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,480
so it's still ongoing.
I still don't have answers,

1412
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:27,970
so she just sort of vanished.
She stopped going to events.

1413
01:04:27,971 --> 01:04:29,120
You stop being,
by the way,

1414
01:04:29,121 --> 01:04:33,560
she is called,
her official title is called Cob,

1415
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:36,350
communicator,
chairman of the board communicator.

1416
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:41,590
She was by his side 24 hours a day.
So imagine going from seeing somebody as

1417
01:04:43,491 --> 01:04:45,380
a permanent like it's not like,
oh,

1418
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,060
sometimes your assistant works.
I'm telling you,

1419
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:51,650
this is a person who worked around the 
clock for him and he was his wife.

1420
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:55,490
What do you think happened?
I don't know which is why I filed that.

1421
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,200
Have you heard anything?
No.

1422
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,190
So no one who used to be a part of the 
church has contacted you?

1423
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,140
There would be no.
Okay.

1424
01:05:03,141 --> 01:05:08,141
Anybody who would,
anybody who I would need to talk to me 

1425
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:13,150
is up behind gates in Riverside County 
at this gold base.

1426
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,850
Anybody that I would need to come out 
and talk to me and give me information,

1427
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:21,940
the FBI information would be behind 
those gates.

1428
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:27,570
Where are they getting money from now?
The scientologists because it seems 

1429
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:32,101
like,
well you have people like Nancy 

1430
01:05:32,101 --> 01:05:32,350
Cartwright who give $10,000,000,
$20,000,000.

1431
01:05:32,351 --> 01:05:35,380
You have some whales and scientology.
Um,

1432
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:40,381
you know,
you have Greta van Susteren and her 

1433
01:05:40,381 --> 01:05:40,381
husband.
You,

1434
01:05:40,381 --> 01:05:40,381
oh,
big time.

1435
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:41,500
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1436
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,370
It's on her wikipedia page as 
scientologists.

1437
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:46,780
Um,
yes,

1438
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:51,781
and her husband to a.
But it seems like they have a giant 

1439
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:51,781
staff.

1440
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,670
They have a lot of people worked for 
free baby.

1441
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:58,090
Those people sign billion year contracts
and they get paid $15 a week.

1442
01:05:58,790 --> 01:05:59,470
No,
I'm not kidding.

1443
01:05:59,471 --> 01:06:01,690
I'm not contracts.
I'm not being funny.

1444
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:07,930
And they get paid $15 a week and they 
work from the moment they get up to 

1445
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,900
midnight.
They work astronomical hours.

1446
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,260
These are called sea org members.
I'm not talking about average 

1447
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:16,400
scientologists and explain,
explain to me the car,

1448
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:20,020
because was that established when l Ron 
Hubbard was evading taxes?

1449
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:21,750
He was on a ship.
Yes.

1450
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,660
And He created the ship called the free 
winds and whatever.

1451
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,930
That's not called the free winds and it 
is called the free winds now,

1452
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:31,000
but that's where they deliver the 
highest level of,

1453
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:33,420
of Scientology,
their Ota,

1454
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:37,030
the Ota Ruins.
But before that,

1455
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:39,970
I don't know the name of his boats,
but I think it was called the Apollo.

1456
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,550
That was a part of going clear.
That was hilarious.

1457
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:43,410
When,
um,

1458
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:47,050
who was it?
One of the writers are one of the Haggis

1459
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:52,390
when he received like the highest level 
shit that wasn't even the highest level,

1460
01:06:52,391 --> 01:06:54,320
which doesn't mean that was ot three.
Yeah.

1461
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,230
And I,
and when I read it,

1462
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,520
I literally,
you know,

1463
01:06:57,521 --> 01:07:01,730
you have to go into a secure room,
talk us through that.

1464
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:03,640
First of all,
you have to get invited.

1465
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:06,670
You have to get an invitation.
Had been scientology for years.

1466
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:08,920
You'd spent a ton of money.
By the way,

1467
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:10,810
most scientists,
by the way,

1468
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:13,480
most scientologists don't even get to 
this most,

1469
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,680
most don't,
right?

1470
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:17,710
Because you have to be wealthy to get to
this and you have to be wealthy.

1471
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,650
But a lot of times what they do that the
new scam is you got to go.

1472
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,990
You get to a level and they go,
we messed that up.

1473
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:24,760
You have to go back down at your 
expense.

1474
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:30,620
You have to Redo that part.
You were talking about that on your 

1475
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:30,620
show.
Yeah.

1476
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,990
Yeah.
So then there will be some new thing and

1477
01:07:31,991 --> 01:07:36,991
now David miscavige rewrites things and 
says he found it in a vault somewhere 

1478
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:38,560
and we all believe it,
baby.

1479
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:43,620
Honestly,
we all believe it because we want to 

1480
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:43,620
believe it.
So talk me through.

1481
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,960
So you go through this rigor level.
Did you get to ot five?

1482
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,210
Got Close?
Yeah.

1483
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:52,630
Um,
I,

1484
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:56,230
uh,
I got to sweat when.

1485
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,730
So you to get to this advanced level.
This is called advanced levels,

1486
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:03,220
right?
You are put through the ringer.

1487
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:05,980
They go through every folder.
You know from the moment you walk into a

1488
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,570
church of Scientology,
they have folders on you.

1489
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:11,190
Everything you've ever said is written 
down and in and videotaped.

1490
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,830
Okay?
So they,

1491
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,400
they,
they get your folders and they call it,

1492
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,130
they call

1493
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,060
it,
they go through it.

1494
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,300
Okay.
And they go through every transgression 

1495
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,960
or you still humping your pillow.
Are you still a,

1496
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:26,210
you know,
a nasty asshole to your mother?

1497
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:31,211
Like they go through everything.
Are you still connected to this person 

1498
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:32,540
who said something bad about scientology
20 years ago?

1499
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:38,060
So they make sure that you're eligible 
to get the advanced data?

1500
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:41,270
Where do they bring you?
Can they bring you into a room?

1501
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:42,830
Where is it at?
It's at.

1502
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:46,460
It's on l Ron Hubbard way in Los Angeles
and fountain.

1503
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:51,400
How nervous you are you freaking out.
Finally,

1504
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:55,670
all this shit I've put up with all my 
life is finally going to be answered all

1505
01:08:55,671 --> 01:09:00,671
my questions of life.
We're going to be answered in this 

1506
01:09:00,671 --> 01:09:03,011
moment and you realize this is the 
moment you're going to get the sacred 

1507
01:09:03,011 --> 01:09:03,011
documents.
So my mother.

1508
01:09:03,011 --> 01:09:03,800
Yeah.
So because I'm a celebrity,

1509
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:06,260
they let my mother come in and she was 
also higher level than me.

1510
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:11,290
Right.
So imagine that I'm in this like double 

1511
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:14,430
like.
So you go through one door and the 

1512
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:14,430
security and then you got to get the 
land.

1513
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:14,660
You'd like it.
You got to get clearance,

1514
01:09:14,661 --> 01:09:19,661
you've got to go take a picture.
You've got to sign documents and say if 

1515
01:09:19,661 --> 01:09:20,540
I ever reveal this,
uh,

1516
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:22,190
it's going to be 100,000
dollars.

1517
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:27,200
You know,
you don't ever get to read any legal 

1518
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:27,200
document that scientology gives you.
So you just sign things,

1519
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,100
you know,
you just say,

1520
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:28,940
sign here,
sign here.

1521
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,350
Like today,
what you did here,

1522
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:35,410
so I don't know,
I could be married to you is for all I 

1523
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:35,410
know when I signed today.
Um,

1524
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:37,400
I liked how you shook your head.
No,

1525
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,260
you don't need to shy.
Okay.

1526
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:40,130
So you know,
comedy,

1527
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:42,200
you don't deny Joe.
So I don't know why you keep denying.

1528
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:44,180
That's how you step up comedy.

1529
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,320
Another notch.
Got It.

1530
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,870
You deny.
Oh,

1531
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:48,920
I didn't get the memo.
Oh,

1532
01:09:48,921 --> 01:09:49,970
okay.
So that's what we're doing now.

1533
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:50,730
Okay,
got it.

1534
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,300
Um,
so the,

1535
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:57,470
uh,
have a secure room,

1536
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:01,300
you got to land your,
take your photo you saw on the scan.

1537
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:03,920
Well they give you a folder.
You have to get a briefcase that only,

1538
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:08,510
you know the code to a briefcase.
So you go up to the window,

1539
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,900
to the AOA window and you hand them your
briefcase,

1540
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:16,930
they scan your briefcase and they put 
the materials in the briefcase and they 

1541
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:20,621
close it.
They turn it back to you and you lock 

1542
01:10:20,621 --> 01:10:22,871
it.
Then you attach the briefcase to your 

1543
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:22,871
body.
I'm not fucking with handcuff,

1544
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:25,390
not like with a little clip like it has 
to be.

1545
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:28,130
Has to be physically connected to you,
so when you go pay,

1546
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:30,220
you have your is coming with you.

1547
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,210
Correct.
Okay,

1548
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:36,500
so your briefcase,
they go go to the go down the hall and 

1549
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,900
use your thing and you're going to be 
led into one door and then you're gonna 

1550
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:40,900
go into another door and then you're 
going to go into the courtroom.

1551
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:46,410
That's what it's called.
So you go into the three doors or two 

1552
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:46,410
doors,
whatever it was,

1553
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:50,170
they sit down,
you open up your case and you read the 

1554
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:51,530
material for the first time,
the answers.

1555
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:54,020
So my mother's sitting there in front of
me.

1556
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,310
Okay.
She's so excited.

1557
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,820
Understand that like,
this is what you want for your kids.

1558
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:03,821
Like you're like,
they're getting up the bridge and 

1559
01:11:03,821 --> 01:11:04,730
they're getting the answers to life.
So when they come back next lifetime,

1560
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:07,520
they're not going to forget everything 
and they're not going to be as fucked up

1561
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:08,810
as they were when they were,
you know what I mean?

1562
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:09,850
Like,
it's,

1563
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:12,690
it's really a proud moment,
you know?

1564
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,130
And so my mom sitting

1565
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:18,300
across from me like so excited and I'm 
reading this,

1566
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:22,620
that my body is made up of other beings,
my body,

1567
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:27,680
my whole body,
my thoughts and everything are mixed in 

1568
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,510
with these other beings that are make up
composed of my body.

1569
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:33,230
Okay.
Are you following me with this?

1570
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:38,250
What's your understanding of it?
Your body's made up of other beings.

1571
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:39,730
Every,
every,

1572
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,040
everything,
everything.

1573
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:45,230
My thumb is composed or other beings,
your hair nails because they're acrylic.

1574
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,450
Your skin's other banks or other banks.
Everything.

1575
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,090
Everything like just here.
Just send,

1576
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:56,091
send.
Just my thumb is as a person is being 

1577
01:11:56,091 --> 01:11:57,910
trapped into this body.
Okay?

1578
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:02,250
So I read this and the supervisor comes 
over and he goes,

1579
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,710
do you understand?
I want you to draw it out.

1580
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:10,670
I want you to draw it out.
So the supervisor has access to this 

1581
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:10,670
information.
Yeah,

1582
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:10,670
he's standing there to make sure.

1583
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:11,220
Right?
So I go like,

1584
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:13,800
this joe a person,
okay.

1585
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:18,860
I go to,
there's a bunch of beings on me like 

1586
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:19,560
that and I give it to him like that.
And he goes,

1587
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
start again.
I want you to read it again and then I 

1588
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,000
want you to draw another one.
So like,

1589
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,070
okay,
so I did all this,

1590
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,020
you know,
and I literally did those Joe,

1591
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:33,021
I mean circles on every part of my body.
So for people drawing a stick figure and

1592
01:12:33,421 --> 01:12:36,600
she's drawing little circles over the 
stick figure right now.

1593
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:40,590
These beings were like from 75 trillion 
years ago,

1594
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:46,310
they were put in volcanoes and blown up 
and packaged and a overlord.

1595
01:12:46,621 --> 01:12:48,190
And uh,
uh.

1596
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,370
Anyway,
are you freaking out at this point?

1597
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,940
I go,
I look at my mother who sent him.

1598
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,140
Now the supervisors standing over me.
So I go,

1599
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,420
what in the book wonder.

1600
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:07,310
She's like,
your mom was in Ota,

1601
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,810
right?
Your Mom's Ota.

1602
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:11,250
Yeah.
Your mom's top of the food chain.

1603
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:16,610
Not only is my mother is probably top of
the food chain when it comes to the 

1604
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:17,190
counseling side.
My mother was top of the food chain when

1605
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:20,010
it came to administering scientology,
which is very rare.

1606
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,190
She was what's considered a highly 
trained auditor,

1607
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:25,410
but she hadn't read this stuff.
Of course she read it.

1608
01:13:25,411 --> 01:13:27,240
She was just there to see my excitement.
Oh,

1609
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:27,900
I see.
Okay.

1610
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:32,950
She was just there as a spectator to see
her daughter received the answers were 

1611
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:37,881
super skeptical or ra supervisor comes 
over and he goes,

1612
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,500
what don't you understand?
I go,

1613
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:41,680
I understand it.
I just,

1614
01:13:41,681 --> 01:13:42,830
I don't,
I don't love that.

1615
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:44,690
Like I'm not happy.
I go,

1616
01:13:44,691 --> 01:13:47,640
I just got to tell you I'm not happy 
with this is what it was.

1617
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,480
And he goes,
well,

1618
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:50,580
you don't need to believe it.
You just need to do it.

1619
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,340
So that's the answer that's given to 
you.

1620
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,620
You don't need to believe it.
You just need to do it.

1621
01:13:56,010 --> 01:14:01,010
So then you have to go and audit this.
You have to go and do it on yourself.

1622
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,550
Talk to these beans on the meter by 
yourself.

1623
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,690
So,
uh,

1624
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:10,020
on the meter meeting you hold the cans.
Cans,

1625
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:11,130
folks,
what they looks like.

1626
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:16,200
It looks like soup cans.
Like we'd drained all the soup from a 

1627
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,410
suit can and it had a string attached to
it and it's connected to some.

1628
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:19,200
Yeah,
you could just google what scientology,

1629
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:20,620
ie meter a meter.
Okay.

1630
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,800
So,
so you have to hold the meter and 

1631
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,201
discuss this,
you're thinking there's just so now 

1632
01:14:28,201 --> 01:14:30,070
you've got to go get your materials.
So after you've been checked out on this

1633
01:14:30,071 --> 01:14:31,810
and they get that,
you get what it is,

1634
01:14:31,811 --> 01:14:36,811
then you go back to the window and they 
give you your actual what you're 

1635
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:39,130
supposed to do with this information.

1636
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,310
So it'll say like,
it'll be a piece of paper and I'll say,

1637
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,350
ask this question and then look at the 
meter and what the answer is.

1638
01:14:47,351 --> 01:14:49,390
Whatever answer comes to your mind,
write it down.

1639
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,520
Do you see what I'm saying?
So all you're doing is awakening these 

1640
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,730
things to talk to them really.
Right.

1641
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:59,800
And so let them go.
You're basically saying like,

1642
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:00,820
go be free,
go.

1643
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,680
This is [inaudible].
Correct.

1644
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:07,970
And by the way,
when I was a scientologist and I heard 

1645
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,650
that this was a story I was,
I didn't know.

1646
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:11,140
So I would go to the Internet and go 
[inaudible] three story,

1647
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:14,470
but I didn't know if it was true.
So I couldn't verify it.

1648
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:16,450
Do you see what I'm saying?
So most people who go,

1649
01:15:16,451 --> 01:15:21,451
that's bullshit because they haven't,
they don't know what they're looking at 

1650
01:15:21,451 --> 01:15:21,451
on the Internet,
right?

1651
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,900
There's no one to verify it with.

1652
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,560
So if I went to my mother,
let's say before I got to this level,

1653
01:15:26,561 --> 01:15:27,110
they,
you're,

1654
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:32,120
you're told to lie to people,
you can't tell people what the answers 

1655
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:32,320
are because they're going to get 
pneumonia.

1656
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,870
You get pneumonia.
Surely will die.

1657
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:40,380
Okay?
So a lot of times when I lied to the 

1658
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:40,380
prize and then they confronted me on it 
and said,

1659
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:40,380
why'd you lie?
I was like,

1660
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:44,650
I had to to save your life.
I mean I can only give you cancer.

1661
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:49,980
So if you were about to go to ot three 
and then you went online and you 

1662
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,570
investigated what is ot three?
And then you read a bunch of stuff about

1663
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:54,790
these little beings in your body and 
then ask your mom.

1664
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:57,670
Your mom would have to lie to you.
She would lie to me as she did,

1665
01:15:57,950 --> 01:16:00,460
as she did.
So after you got through this,

1666
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,330
what made you do four and five?

1667
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:07,300
There's always the carrot of like,
just wait it just by the way,

1668
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:09,400
here's what they do.
They set up that year,

1669
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:10,900
the auditor now,
so you're,

1670
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,480
you're auditing these things in your 
body,

1671
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:15,520
you're now the boss.
So they go,

1672
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:17,020
they tell you,
get your hat on,

1673
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:20,470
like it's your job.
You don't need to believe anything,

1674
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:26,010
you just need to audit them.
So you need to do your job as an 

1675
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:26,320
auditor.
That's what they're called.

1676
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:30,400
Auditor's people who are the ones who 
take you into session and scientology,

1677
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:35,420
right?
So you feel like you're in a leadership 

1678
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:35,420
role.
So you're doing these things a favor,

1679
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:36,160
you know,
and you're like,

1680
01:16:36,161 --> 01:16:36,970
well,
maybe it's true.

1681
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:37,660
I don't know.
I mean,

1682
01:16:37,661 --> 01:16:39,850
I do sometimes hear voices,
like,

1683
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:44,910
you know,
you have a moment with yourself and 

1684
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:44,910
you're like,
I might be really kind of crazy.

1685
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:45,090
Um,
so you're like,

1686
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,360
maybe this is an answer.

1687
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,600
It's,
it's sick because it speaks to a side of

1688
01:16:49,601 --> 01:16:52,270
you that wants answers about life,
you know,

1689
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:53,230
and then you're like,
no,

1690
01:16:53,231 --> 01:16:54,700
this is some crazy shit,
man.

1691
01:16:54,701 --> 01:16:59,701
That wasn't even the people that know 
it.

1692
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:05,430
Listen,
you believe what you want to believe at 

1693
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:07,351
the time,
does it feel to you at the moment like 

1694
01:17:07,351 --> 01:17:09,030
maybe if you just keep going,
fall into place,

1695
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:11,480
then I'll make sense.
Like I'm confused now,

1696
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:13,760
but if I contemplate this and I really 
think it over,

1697
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:16,610
eventually I'm going to receive enough 
information.

1698
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,700
This is all going to be like,
oh,

1699
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,140
I was a fool.
I didn't understand.

1700
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:26,630
So for example,
one time I had talked to a friend about 

1701
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:26,630
it,
I said,

1702
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:30,521
you know,
I heard something about some genius 

1703
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,080
shit.
She pulled me into celebrity center so 

1704
01:17:32,841 --> 01:17:37,070
fast into a secured room and she handed 
me my aunt.

1705
01:17:37,071 --> 01:17:42,071
She said,
don't you ever say that word outside of 

1706
01:17:42,071 --> 01:17:42,071
secured room?

1707
01:17:42,071 --> 01:17:43,070
I'm writing a knowledge report on you.
She said,

1708
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:48,071
I'm writing.
You never say that word out loud in a 

1709
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:50,540
room that's not secured.
Okay.

1710
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:53,470
And never seen again.
So she wrote a report on the report.

1711
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,240
She wrote a report on me.
I got sent to what's called ethics,

1712
01:17:56,241 --> 01:18:01,010
which is like the Justice Department of 
celebrities that have of scientology and

1713
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:06,011
they said they brought me into another 
secured room because they have to get 

1714
01:18:06,011 --> 01:18:06,650
somebody who knows this information and 
they said,

1715
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:10,730
never ever say that would say this.
It never confirm it.

1716
01:18:10,731 --> 01:18:13,850
Never deny it.
Never give that information out,

1717
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,560
ever.
That just never discuss it.

1718
01:18:15,561 --> 01:18:17,450
Just say I'd never heard of it.
You sound crazy.

1719
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:21,590
And that's what we all say.
You sound crazy or you know,

1720
01:18:21,591 --> 01:18:23,750
properly done.
You get it.

1721
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:28,810
You know,
like you'll get it if it's properly 

1722
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:28,810
done.
Those people didn't do it properly.

1723
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,660
That's why they didn't understand that.
Do you see what I'm saying?

1724
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,600
There's a,
there's a line that you cross.

1725
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:34,910
We're like,
this is my life,

1726
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:36,770
this is scientology.
That is what I believe.

1727
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,320
And then you cross this line.
Oh my God,

1728
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:40,550
this is bullshit,
right?

1729
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:42,310
That,
that's uh,

1730
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,310
that line,
that bridge that you cross and your mind

1731
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:50,140
is a very distinct transition.
So what,

1732
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:54,260
what was that like?
Like what is that transition like?

1733
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:58,220
Like what is,
what is your life like now?

1734
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:59,080
Once,
you know,

1735
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:02,510
how long ago did you leave?
July will be four years.

1736
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,530
That's it.
Yeah.

1737
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,580
That's not long.
No,

1738
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:06,740
it's really recent.
Joe,

1739
01:19:06,741 --> 01:19:09,250
and I'm still,
you know,

1740
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,630
finding myself.
I'm still like,

1741
01:19:11,631 --> 01:19:13,310
who am I?
What do I believe,

1742
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:15,550
you know,
am I some bullshit?

1743
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:18,080
Am I a person that,
like you're saying,

1744
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:19,580
loves a fight because I don't want that.

1745
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,400
I don't want to be that person who loves
to fight just to fight.

1746
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,630
I want to be on the path of,
of being righteous.

1747
01:19:26,631 --> 01:19:29,150
I want to be who I really am.
And,

1748
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:34,151
and,
and who I really am is sometimes an 

1749
01:19:34,151 --> 01:19:34,151
asshole Joe.
Sometimes I am,

1750
01:19:34,151 --> 01:19:36,110
I have a horrible temper.
I'm like,

1751
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:36,660
uh,
uh.

1752
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:40,580
Sometimes I feel like I'm like an old 
school mafia person stuck in a female,

1753
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:45,630
but I have really extreme thoughts about
life and I'm finding who I am.

1754
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:48,920
I'm finding out what I really believe 
because a lot of times I don't know.

1755
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,150
I go,
do I believe in that?

1756
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:55,180
Don't believe in that.
I was told that everybody smokes pot as 

1757
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:55,180
evil.
Do I believe that?

1758
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:57,410
Everybody who cheats is evil and 
horrible and just lost.

1759
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,460
Do I believe that other religions are 
lost?

1760
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,540
Do I believe that everybody needs.
Like I Willi I'm searching.

1761
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:04,240
You have to reevaluate your entire 
fleet.

1762
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,890
Everything.
And it was a big part of my day.

1763
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,130
Remember he gave

1764
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:12,330
me a mission,
gave me purpose and that's what I hear a

1765
01:20:12,331 --> 01:20:15,450
lot from scientologists is excellent 
intelligence.

1766
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:20,810
Not just hearing their pain of losing 
their families and everything they've 

1767
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:23,361
ever known but not having purpose when 
you wake up in the morning like you 

1768
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:25,380
know,
we have purpose joe,

1769
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:30,390
we have kids,
thank God for them but this was so much 

1770
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,760
bigger.
It was for your children's children.

1771
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,650
So giant factor for people.
Yeah.

1772
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:39,830
I have some friends that were deeply 
involved in the mormon religion and 

1773
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:43,020
they're not anymore and it was really 
weird because we went to dinner once and

1774
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,600
they were saying do you believe in a 
higher power?

1775
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,130
And I said it's entirely possible.
I said I don't,

1776
01:20:49,131 --> 01:20:54,131
but I don't believe in anything that I 
don't have any evidence of its entirely 

1777
01:20:54,131 --> 01:20:57,801
possible.
Like I think the universe is an 

1778
01:20:57,801 --> 01:21:00,051
incredible mystery and I think the life 
itself in consciousness is an amazing 

1779
01:21:00,051 --> 01:21:02,070
mystery and I don't think we have all 
the answers.

1780
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:07,100
I don't think.
I don't think an ant can understand a 

1781
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:07,470
cell phone and I don't think I can 
understand the universe.

1782
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:09,870
I just think my brain is not evolved 
enough.

1783
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:10,810
I don't think our,
our,

1784
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,880
our understanding has reached a point 
where we can really accurately describe 

1785
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,770
what this is all about.
And their answer was like,

1786
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,640
how do you get up in the morning?
I go,

1787
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:24,090
I love life has I like,
I like drinking nice wine.

1788
01:21:24,091 --> 01:21:26,400
I like having dinner.
I like being with my friends.

1789
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:31,460
I like a gel and not everybody has that.
Well they probably should find some 

1790
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:32,510
things that they enjoy about the life.

1791
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:37,550
Exactly.
But that's the thing is finding those 

1792
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:39,711
things for st intelligence.
It's like a lot of my friends who didn't

1793
01:21:40,231 --> 01:21:41,670
really know what I was going through the
church go,

1794
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:46,671
you know,
you've already kind of childish at 

1795
01:21:46,671 --> 01:21:46,671
times,
you know,

1796
01:21:46,671 --> 01:21:49,281
because I never went to dinner in my 
thirties and forties and had wine.

1797
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,140
Like I wouldn't go to dinner,
have wine,

1798
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:54,390
I'd get reports written on me,
you know,

1799
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:56,550
we,
we had to go to church the next day.

1800
01:21:56,551 --> 01:22:01,330
I wasn't going out to dinner after the 
king of Queens and enjoying my friends.

1801
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,760
And if I did Joe,
I was thinking they're laws,

1802
01:22:03,761 --> 01:22:05,880
they need scientology,
you know,

1803
01:22:05,881 --> 01:22:09,400
I was never really there.
I was never really part of a,

1804
01:22:09,401 --> 01:22:11,130
um,
like living for the first time.

1805
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:16,131
But I do have faith.
That's the one thing that I have found 

1806
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,420
and not in a weird way,
not in a,

1807
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:23,421
I'm in another cult way,
not in just I had faith for the first 

1808
01:22:23,421 --> 01:22:25,350
time.
I don't believe in any one thing.

1809
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,430
I believe in a higher power.
And I believe that faith,

1810
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,040
having faith is a big thing.

1811
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:34,930
These people that I was friends with,
I'm still friends with this.

1812
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:36,660
This conversation.
Got It.

1813
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:41,661
Got a little weird that night,
but it got way weirder years later 

1814
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:44,750
because they wanted to believe in.
What do you mean they left the Mormon 

1815
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:44,750
Church?
Well,

1816
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,020
because then they'd go,
they became untethered.

1817
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:49,080
And uh,
the conversation I had with the wife was

1818
01:22:49,081 --> 01:22:52,530
very strange because she was like,
I grew up in,

1819
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:55,440
in doctrinated,
in this fundamentalist religion.

1820
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:57,270
And she goes to,
now that I'm not in it,

1821
01:22:57,630 --> 01:22:59,190
she goes,
I don't know what to believe.

1822
01:22:59,191 --> 01:23:02,430
And I realized that my mindset is kind 
of fucked up because I,

1823
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:06,160
I'm indoctrinated like my brain 
developed

1824
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,850
as a young age believing nonsense and 
never questioning it.

1825
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:11,620
She goes,
so I feel very vulnerable,

1826
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,910
very susceptible.
She goes,

1827
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:15,640
I feel like the right cult came along.
They could scoop me up.

1828
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:20,641
And she was laughing about it,
but she wasn't laughing about thing on 

1829
01:23:20,641 --> 01:23:20,900
the opposite.
Now that's why like when I,

1830
01:23:20,901 --> 01:23:21,430
I,
uh,

1831
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:25,840
I don't want you to tell me nothing.
I don't want to be told a damn thing.

1832
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:29,380
I've been told my whole life what to do 
and how to think.

1833
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:33,970
So I've gotten the opposite.
Just don't tell me what I need to do and

1834
01:23:33,971 --> 01:23:37,710
it it at the pendulum swing is far.
Do you have any.

1835
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,240
Let me go into the DMV when they go,
you need to stand there.

1836
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:42,430
I don't need to stand anywhere.
Like I don't need.

1837
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:45,040
Guess what?
I don't need my license renewed and then

1838
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:45,850
I'm that person.

1839
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:50,850
I want to destroy my whole day and get a
ticket because I don't want to be told 

1840
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,000
what to do.
He doesn't talk to me.

1841
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:52,450
Like,
um,

1842
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:55,460
you know your child and don't talk to me
like,

1843
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,250
you know,
I'm very much that way.

1844
01:23:57,251 --> 01:23:58,420
You know,
you should have shorter now.

1845
01:23:58,421 --> 01:24:01,030
I don't give a shit what you think about
my nails.

1846
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:06,660
I want them that they're slightly longer
than average because it's purposeful and

1847
01:24:07,151 --> 01:24:09,370
when I don't want them anymore I won't 
have them.

1848
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:14,640
But that's just a small scale.
But I don't want people telling me what 

1849
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,350
I should think anymore and let me find 
my way.

1850
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:19,010
I'm going to make mistakes.
I,

1851
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:23,110
but I want to find my own way.
Sort of reestablishing your own personal

1852
01:24:23,111 --> 01:24:24,730
sovereign.
I don't know what it is,

1853
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:25,690
Joel.
And like I said,

1854
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,970
I'm going to Piss some people off,
I'm sure,

1855
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:30,070
and I'm going to make a lot of mistakes.

1856
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:33,910
I'm going to not be the perfect person.
People think I am or want me to be,

1857
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,700
but I got to make mistakes.
That's how you learn.

1858
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:39,980
I wasn't able to learn.
It was like,

1859
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,160
do it this way,
this the way we do it.

1860
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:43,720
We don't do this,
we don't do that.

1861
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:46,600
I mean,
I was always a little bit of a rebel in,

1862
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,540
but I thought everybody was being held 
to this higher standard.

1863
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:54,541
They weren't.
I was finding out other celebrities was 

1864
01:24:54,541 --> 01:24:55,330
smoking pot and then going into the 
sauna.

1865
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:56,410
Yeah,
exactly.

1866
01:24:56,590 --> 01:25:01,590
Doing their purification.
Run down 100 times because that's when 

1867
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:02,540
that's in the beginning steps of 
scientology.

1868
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:04,460
You have to do what's called a 
purification rundown.

1869
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:09,240
It's supposed to a detox your body of 
all you know,

1870
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,830
nothing's.
You're not there yet.

1871
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:15,930
No,
you don't get that.

1872
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,550
I don't get to say on baby until you get
there.

1873
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,600
Oh.
When do you get there?

1874
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:22,750
What?
You have to spend $380,000

1875
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:25,270
and about 40 years of your life.
Forty,

1876
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:26,370
yeah,
that's a lot of work.

1877
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,160
Still work.
Um,

1878
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,240
no,
you,

1879
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:33,270
you learn a,
basically a purification rundown is 

1880
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:35,941
just,
you're supposed to sweat out all of the 

1881
01:25:35,941 --> 01:25:37,921
toxins lodged in your fatty tissue.
Now the problem with that is,

1882
01:25:38,561 --> 01:25:43,561
um,
you taking large amounts of value sin 

1883
01:25:43,561 --> 01:25:43,561
and they claim you're,
you're,

1884
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:48,600
you're running out like a Suntan from,
from when you're a kid and from other 

1885
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:52,330
lifetimes.
And it's yes,

1886
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:56,560
Flash,
nice and hot and yes,

1887
01:25:56,561 --> 01:25:59,030
and you have to sit in the sauna for 
five hours of dance,

1888
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,540
a five hour thing.
But I was finding out,

1889
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:02,230
I was like,
wait a minute,

1890
01:26:02,231 --> 01:26:04,760
why was that prison?
He was smoking pot to smoke pot,

1891
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:05,360
right?
Like,

1892
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:07,370
I haven't been smoking pot this whole 
time,

1893
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:12,690
you know,
where people do and I'm learning that 

1894
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:15,281
other people were smoking pot,
doing other drugs and then going in the 

1895
01:26:15,281 --> 01:26:15,281
store.
And I was like,

1896
01:26:15,281 --> 01:26:15,830
wait,
I didn't know that was an option for me.

1897
01:26:15,831 --> 01:26:17,870
Like I was living by this,
you know what I mean?

1898
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:21,170
So that's what I'm going through now.
I'm not saying I'm smoking pot,

1899
01:26:21,171 --> 01:26:26,171
but somebody want to a little bit only 
because I want to be calmer,

1900
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:29,150
but it might not make it all adds to.
Okay,

1901
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:29,810
that I don't want it.

1902
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:33,540
Could I have a different effect on every
tool for that shit?

1903
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:35,630
No.
You're definitely not John Old.

1904
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:36,120
No,
you're not.

1905
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:37,350
No,
you're alive.

1906
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:42,500
If you're alive,
you can experience the benefits of a 

1907
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,931
consciousness enhancing substance,
whether it's mushrooms or pot or any 

1908
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:44,931
job.

1909
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:46,000
That's crazy.
It's not crazy.

1910
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:49,120
It's not crazy.
I don't know.

1911
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:49,880
I look at me.
I'm like,

1912
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:53,100
are you freaking out?
We'd been in a cult.

1913
01:26:53,101 --> 01:26:54,700
You're whole life.
Sorry folks.

1914
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,960
Nobody insights.
All other than the people are going to 

1915
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:01,960
tag me in.
You

1916
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:02,090
are listening to this.
Well,

1917
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,310
even the people that are going to attack
you and me,

1918
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,010
I don't feel bad for them.
I feel bad for them.

1919
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:12,011
I feel bad for anybody that wants to 
attack anybody for their beliefs or for 

1920
01:27:12,011 --> 01:27:12,011
talking about stuff,
and guess what?

1921
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:17,170
If your religion or your belief system,
it's so easily destroyed that someone 

1922
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:22,061
can have a disparaging opinion about it 
and it that threatens you to the point 

1923
01:27:22,061 --> 01:27:24,140
where you want to attack that person.
You're doing something wrong,

1924
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,440
you're leading your life wrong,
you're on the wrong path.

1925
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:32,530
There's a lot of people that have 
different opinions about a lot of 

1926
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:32,840
different things and it's one of the 
more interesting things about life,

1927
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,760
right?
Like you don't like coconut water.

1928
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:37,640
I fucking love coconut water and we're 
allowed to you,

1929
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:38,960
don't you?
You like Cologne.

1930
01:27:38,961 --> 01:27:40,100
I think it smells like shit.

1931
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:42,490
We're allowed to have different 
opinions.

1932
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:47,491
This is one of the beautiful things 
about life and people like different 

1933
01:27:47,491 --> 01:27:47,570
kinds of music,
different styles of art.

1934
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:50,630
They like different kinds of houses in 
different landscapes.

1935
01:27:50,631 --> 01:27:52,190
It's,
it's one of the things that makes people

1936
01:27:52,191 --> 01:27:53,020
interesting.
Right?

1937
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:56,750
So the problem with any kind of 
ideology,

1938
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:58,400
the,
the problem with what,

1939
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:03,550
what this represents or any other kind 
of cult or any other kind of really 

1940
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:08,951
rigid structure is that it's human 
beings are very susceptible to those 

1941
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:12,440
kinds of routines are very susceptible 
to influence.

1942
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:17,590
We're very susceptible to other people 
carving out is predetermined patterns of

1943
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:21,920
behavior that you just quickly slot into
because it keeps you from having to form

1944
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:22,960
your own opinions.
Right,

1945
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:28,030
and that's,
that's everything that's wrong when you 

1946
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:28,030
truly believe that you believe it.
Yeah.

1947
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:28,540
I'm not sure.
And you do.

1948
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,610
You do.
I mean it's very easy for people to just

1949
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:36,611
slot themselves into these patterns and 
adopt those opinions as their own 

1950
01:28:36,741 --> 01:28:41,741
instead of trying to formulate their own
because it's very complicated to try to 

1951
01:28:41,741 --> 01:28:44,411
formulate your own opinions and they 
have to be flexible because new 

1952
01:28:44,411 --> 01:28:47,621
information comes up and then you have 
to kind of change them and adjust them 

1953
01:28:47,621 --> 01:28:49,850
and then recognize that perhaps you like
you're recognizing right now that like,

1954
01:28:49,851 --> 01:28:54,851
wow,
I've like kind of like I've lived a lie 

1955
01:28:54,851 --> 01:28:54,851
for like a long period of time.

1956
01:28:54,851 --> 01:28:57,740
I mean,
it doesn't discredit you as a human.

1957
01:28:57,890 --> 01:28:58,610
It doesn't.
I mean,

1958
01:28:58,611 --> 01:29:01,980
and it's very brave of you to discuss 
that because it

1959
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,980
gives people that are listening to this 
the same sort of understanding of these 

1960
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:11,691
thoughts that are in their own mind,
whether it's because of whatever 

1961
01:29:11,691 --> 01:29:14,601
religion.
Fill in the blank and that's the other 

1962
01:29:14,601 --> 01:29:16,911
thing about this.
How the fuck did they have tax exempt 

1963
01:29:16,911 --> 01:29:19,200
status because they,
first of all the irs,

1964
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:24,201
the answered the irs questions to get 
that status and one of them is you have 

1965
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:29,310
any affiliation with any other God of 
which they said no,

1966
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:30,270
they deal with you.
They,

1967
01:29:30,271 --> 01:29:35,271
they,
they believe that they are spiritual 

1968
01:29:35,271 --> 01:29:35,700
beings and they deal with the spirit.
Um,

1969
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:40,020
and so they answered the questions that 
needed to be answered for the irs.

1970
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,800
But it's amazing that any religion gets 
ca tax exempt status.

1971
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:46,600
All of them are ridiculous.
Well,

1972
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:52,310
I don't want to make a comment about 
other like bonafide religions because I 

1973
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:53,700
don't like some of our bonafide.

1974
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:55,440
Yes,
I do.

1975
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,780
I gonna tell you why.
I mean honestly,

1976
01:29:57,781 --> 01:30:02,781
Joe,
you have to really make the distinction 

1977
01:30:02,781 --> 01:30:05,631
between an organization that takes your 
mind hostage from the minute you walk in

1978
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:12,040
and that you are,
you are required to be there 22 and a 

1979
01:30:12,121 --> 01:30:15,210
half hours a day that your eternity is 
at stake.

1980
01:30:15,211 --> 01:30:16,920
That the planet,
every man,

1981
01:30:16,921 --> 01:30:18,330
woman,
and child on this planet,

1982
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:22,290
they're lives are at stake with what we 
do in scientology.

1983
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:25,650
So using the pen fundamentalist 
Christians.

1984
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:27,930
You said fundamentalists.
Okay.

1985
01:30:27,931 --> 01:30:31,620
So I'm not talking about that.
What I'm talking about are what,

1986
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:34,590
what I witnessed as a child with my 
grandmother.

1987
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,170
My grandma lived down the street from 
her church.

1988
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:39,930
We would walk in on the way to get,
you know,

1989
01:30:39,931 --> 01:30:44,430
sausage and meatballs and things she 
needed to make her sauce and she'd go in

1990
01:30:44,431 --> 01:30:49,431
and light a candle for her friend Connie
or she'd go in and light a candle 

1991
01:30:49,431 --> 01:30:49,830
because I lost my ring.

1992
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:52,800
Or She'd pray to this scene or that 
scene.

1993
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:56,130
And when I was scared at night she would
say,

1994
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,720
pray to this person,
pray to you know,

1995
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:02,490
do your cross and God's going to protect
you when you sleep.

1996
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:06,760
And here's your angel and you know,
here's your little car.

1997
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,610
She would give me little,
um,

1998
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:10,380
you know,
the saints on the,

1999
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,690
on the necklaces and stuff.
And she'd say,

2000
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:17,691
and I believed for that night that that 
scene was protecting me or that God was 

2001
01:31:17,691 --> 01:31:20,220
protecting me.
And and those comfort,

2002
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:22,770
it gave me comfort and so that's what I 
tell my daughter.

2003
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:25,530
I don't want you to believe in anything.
Although I did baptize,

2004
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:28,290
baptize her as a Catholic,
I said,

2005
01:31:28,291 --> 01:31:32,910
I want you to really find your way with 
some kind of spirituality,

2006
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:38,060
but I'm going to baptize you to Catholic
because I feel you need some kind of 

2007
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:41,001
foundation,
but I don't want you to be forced to 

2008
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:43,101
believe in anything,
but I want you to believe in something 

2009
01:31:43,101 --> 01:31:45,960
or you're going to fall for anything.
And I didn't have structure as a child.

2010
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:49,170
I had scientology.
And by instructure right.

2011
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:54,770
Well I mean a real,
a real religious base.

2012
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:56,690
That religious base.
Correct.

2013
01:31:56,870 --> 01:32:01,870
That's never heard.
The difference between a cult and a 

2014
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:01,870
religion is a beautiful quote.

2015
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:01,870
What is it called?
Bullshit.

2016
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:06,560
It was created by one person.
That person knows it's bullshit in a 

2017
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:06,560
religion.
That guy's dead.

2018
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,190
Why did you come up with it?
No,

2019
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:11,750
no,
no.

2020
01:32:13,290 --> 01:32:14,810
It's just something I read.
Yeah.

2021
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:15,910
I like it,
but it's true.

2022
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,290
So I,
I would.

2023
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:19,210
So that was my experience with religion.
No,

2024
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:24,211
I know people feel very differently 
about religion being forced down their 

2025
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:25,100
throat,
but I would have kind of loved,

2026
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:30,120
you know,
going with my family every Sunday to 

2027
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:30,120
church.
I think it,

2028
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,650
it created a,
when I saw my father doing that with his

2029
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:37,651
other daughters,
I was a little bit jealous that we 

2030
01:32:37,651 --> 01:32:40,261
didn't have that right.
But we didn't get Easter dresses and it 

2031
01:32:40,261 --> 01:32:40,430
wasn't a big thing because my,
you know,

2032
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,660
we didn't have that growing comfort,
right?

2033
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,130
Yes.
So that's also the,

2034
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:50,260
the um,
I'm trying to look.

2035
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:53,360
It doesn't cost a quarter of a million 
dollars,

2036
01:32:53,361 --> 01:32:55,780
you know,
to get up to this level that I explained

2037
01:32:55,781 --> 01:32:57,400
to you.
And by the end of it,

2038
01:32:57,430 --> 01:33:01,570
if you have made millions that you're 
going to give those millions away,

2039
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:07,010
um,
it is a requirement that's on a 

2040
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:09,910
requirement and in other religions that 
you are not allowed to talk to certain 

2041
01:33:11,261 --> 01:33:16,261
people that now I understand that there 
are other calls that do that.

2042
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:21,910
And I,
and I do call those things a comb 

2043
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:24,090
because I don't think any organization,
any church would tell people who they 

2044
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:28,741
can and cannot talk to what they can and
cannot read what they should and 

2045
01:33:28,741 --> 01:33:33,001
shouldn't do.
The person should make their own 

2046
01:33:33,001 --> 01:33:35,140
decisions based on the information 
that's given to them or information that

2047
01:33:35,141 --> 01:33:37,070
they find on their own.
Right.

2048
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,870
It's very different.
This is a pay before you go proposition.

2049
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:44,380
There are repercussions to leaving.
Nobody knows that.

2050
01:33:44,381 --> 01:33:47,980
I went in and out of the Catholic church
the other day and lit a candle.

2051
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,490
It was calling me saying,
where are you?

2052
01:33:51,491 --> 01:33:53,160
Why you not here?
Who you talking to?

2053
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:55,750
You need to come in or we're going to 
start working on your family,

2054
01:33:55,751 --> 01:33:57,330
destroying your family.
Do you

2055
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,630
does understand what you're saying.
But you know,

2056
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:04,640
there's,
there's different styles of behavior 

2057
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,870
patterns that exist in all sorts of 
religions.

2058
01:34:06,871 --> 01:34:09,200
Like Buddhism is radically different 
than Islam,

2059
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:14,380
you know,
and there's different requirements that 

2060
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,041
they ask of the people.
And a lot of it is based on the 

2061
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:16,580
environment that these religions were 
established.

2062
01:34:16,581 --> 01:34:19,440
10,
based on how long these things have gone

2063
01:34:19,441 --> 01:34:21,840
on for whether or not the,
uh,

2064
01:34:21,841 --> 01:34:26,841
the people that are a part of that 
religion have gone through the 

2065
01:34:26,841 --> 01:34:26,841
enlightenment,
like what,

2066
01:34:26,841 --> 01:34:31,101
what different factors played apart and 
what standards they uphold today and 

2067
01:34:31,101 --> 01:34:35,271
what make people.
But my issue is always with subscribing 

2068
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:39,180
to predetermine patterns of behavior and
ideologies.

2069
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:42,000
Where were they indoctrinate you on 
specific ways to think.

2070
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:43,710
And that's what this is.
Yeah.

2071
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,180
That's what a lot of religions are.
I mean,

2072
01:34:45,181 --> 01:34:46,740
it's,
it's a real issue with,

2073
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:47,730
with human beings.

2074
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:49,710
Well,
my grandmother,

2075
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,230
of course was,
was yes,

2076
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:58,520
exactly where he used to think a certain
way about people or a lifestyle

2077
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:04,210
and a,
but she had the choice to be friends 

2078
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:05,910
with somebody who maybe wasn't those 
things.

2079
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,860
Right.
Choice.

2080
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:08,410
We don't have a choice.
No,

2081
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:10,490
it's,
it's pretty obvious that some,

2082
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:13,580
especially in particular,
the way you are describing scientology,

2083
01:35:13,581 --> 01:35:18,290
it's far more suppressive than most and 
far more rigid in its behavior patterns.

2084
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:23,300
Right?
And they forced you into these behavior 

2085
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:25,331
patterns and it's,
it's incredibly difficult to break 

2086
01:35:25,331 --> 01:35:28,031
behavior patterns,
especially when you believe firmly in 

2087
01:35:28,031 --> 01:35:28,340
your heart that this is the right way to
be.

2088
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

2089
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,220
Ben's justified because you're clearing 
the planet.

2090
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,540
It's just amazing that they don't have 
to pay taxes.

2091
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:37,010
That's stunning if you look at their 
doctrine,

2092
01:35:37,011 --> 01:35:37,270
if you will.

2093
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:42,320
But that's the thing,
the word where there have been judges 

2094
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,390
that should have looked into the doctor 
and they said it's not,

2095
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:48,500
we can,
we cannot actually look into the 

2096
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:48,500
doctrine.
Um,

2097
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:48,570
but they need to understand that there 
are.

2098
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:51,960
You need to look into the doctrine where
it's abusive and hurting people.

2099
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:55,110
If your doctrine calls for you to hurt 
people,

2100
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:56,450
hurt children,
uh,

2101
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:57,810
the government does need to step in.

2102
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,670
You're right.
Yeah,

2103
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,160
I agree.
Well,

2104
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:06,161
it just absolutely this,
the accusations about the sea org and 

2105
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:09,961
about people making 15 bucks a week and 
about these people that are essentially 

2106
01:36:09,961 --> 01:36:11,360
working as indentured servants,
that's not legal.

2107
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:16,510
They sign up for it.
So as long as you sign up for it and 

2108
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:19,121
sign that billion dollar contract,
you're not subject to any minimum wage 

2109
01:36:19,121 --> 01:36:19,870
laws or anything along those lines.
Yup.

2110
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:20,680
At men,
by the way,

2111
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:22,640
Joel,
not really that smart enough to speak on

2112
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:24,560
these things because people think that 
my,

2113
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:30,100
that my agenda is to take away their tax
exempt status.

2114
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:31,760
Uh,
I would love for that to happen,

2115
01:36:31,761 --> 01:36:36,761
but that's not the reason for the show.
They're just want to express yourself 

2116
01:36:36,761 --> 01:36:38,130
and be honest about your experiences and
help other people experience free.

2117
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,910
These are other people's experiences 
too.

2118
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,280
But because I know it's true because I 
experienced it,

2119
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:47,310
I'm cleaning and I'm saying,
you know,

2120
01:36:47,311 --> 01:36:49,200
if you're going to bully somebody,
bully me,

2121
01:36:49,201 --> 01:36:54,201
bully a and a,
but I'm going to let these people tell 

2122
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:54,201
their stories because they're telling 
the truth.

2123
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:54,430
Right?
Yeah.

2124
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:56,760
And if we weren't telling the truth,
you would have sued us.

2125
01:36:56,910 --> 01:36:58,230
So cut the shit already.

2126
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:59,140
Well,
that's what's interesting.

2127
01:36:59,141 --> 01:37:01,700
Is that the disclaimer at the end of 
your episode,

2128
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:03,880
our episode,
it's in 100 times.

2129
01:37:03,881 --> 01:37:05,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

2130
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,070
It's bullshit.
But they got to do it.

2131
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,060
I understand.
Smart.

2132
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:09,210
It's smart to do it,
you know,

2133
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,660
to me it's annoying.
Every time I see it,

2134
01:37:11,661 --> 01:37:12,710
I roll my eyes.
I mean,

2135
01:37:12,711 --> 01:37:15,020
every time I see it,
I understand it,

2136
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,460
but you know,
it's,

2137
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:16,990
it,
it,

2138
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:19,340
it's annoying because what we're saying 
is true.

2139
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,370
Again,
this is a litigious group.

2140
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:27,430
Okay?
They're not going to shy away from many 

2141
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:27,430
lawsuits if they could have sued us or 
they would have,

2142
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:30,470
but they know what we're saying is true.
These are the policies of the church.

2143
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:31,300
Here's the thing,
Joe,

2144
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:33,320
what they should do is go,
yeah,

2145
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:36,200
we subscribe to these policies.
You don't fucking like it.

2146
01:37:36,201 --> 01:37:39,590
Don't be part of our church,
but don't say we're all aligning.

2147
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:41,810
It's right there on the Internet.
You assholes.

2148
01:37:41,811 --> 01:37:43,700
I had the books at my freaking garage.

2149
01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:47,130
What are you learning about?
Not Owning at all?

2150
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,180
I felt like you were.
No,

2151
01:37:48,181 --> 01:37:48,600
no,
no.

2152
01:37:48,601 --> 01:37:51,180
I'm just thinking now your,
your,

2153
01:37:51,181 --> 01:37:53,280
your,
your current state right now,

2154
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:56,400
like doing this show and uh,
having all these people.

2155
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,530
I feel like you're helping a lot of them
for sure.

2156
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,160
Because you're,
you're,

2157
01:37:59,161 --> 01:38:00,960
you're,
you're getting their message out there.

2158
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:05,961
And again,
it's a very heartbreaking message when 

2159
01:38:05,961 --> 01:38:08,001
you see these people and they are not in
contact with their children and they're 

2160
01:38:08,001 --> 01:38:08,570
not in contact with loved ones.
It's an imagine

2161
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:13,700
daughter doing those videos going.
My mother just wants to make a buck my.

2162
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:16,830
I'm disgusted by my mother and she 
discussed that.

2163
01:38:16,831 --> 01:38:18,630
She,
that she's my mother.

2164
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:22,290
I would be crazy.
I know.

2165
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:22,900
It's crazy.
I'm,

2166
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,560
I'm one of the lucky ones,
you know,

2167
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:27,390
like these things didn't happen to me.
Joe.

2168
01:38:27,391 --> 01:38:29,490
I wasn't mad.
I wasn't molested,

2169
01:38:29,491 --> 01:38:32,400
I wasn't hurt.
I wasn't physically hurt.

2170
01:38:32,401 --> 01:38:35,970
I wasn't.
My kids didn't disconnect from me.

2171
01:38:35,971 --> 01:38:39,330
My Mother didn't disconnect from me.
I have my mother during the holidays.

2172
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:42,960
I have my sisters,
I have my husband now.

2173
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:48,250
Your life must have revolved around the 
church and a very big way.

2174
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,300
Socially.
Yeah.

2175
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:54,660
What is that like now?
Like all those people they've written 

2176
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:54,660
you off,
right?

2177
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:55,050
Yeah.
Um,

2178
01:38:55,120 --> 01:39:00,120
it's sad.
I'm sad for them because our 

2179
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:02,341
relationship was,
was obviously I'm dependent on my 

2180
01:39:02,341 --> 01:39:03,100
relationship to the Church of 
Scientology.

2181
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:06,710
So you can understand that right from 
them being brainwashed and.

2182
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,640
No,
because they knew me.

2183
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,950
Right.
So from my church to say,

2184
01:39:11,951 --> 01:39:15,730
you're lea is an enemy of our church.
My friend should have said bullshit,

2185
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:17,920
but aren't you kind of an enemy of them 
now though?

2186
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:19,810
Uh,
I don't know why I would be.

2187
01:39:19,811 --> 01:39:21,040
They know we're telling the truth.

2188
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:23,580
Right?
But that truth is very damaging to their

2189
01:39:23,581 --> 01:39:26,370
organization because the organization of
the church,

2190
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,150
right?
You're right.

2191
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,520
No,
I'm not saying anything wrong behind it.

2192
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:31,380
Say you don't like it.
Don't be part of it.

2193
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:32,760
Yeah,
but they can't really do that.

2194
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:37,780
Why?
Because they're doing some fucked up 

2195
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:37,780
things.
Maybe

2196
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:38,600
they say they're the epitome of morality
there.

2197
01:39:38,601 --> 01:39:39,290
The,
the,

2198
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:42,500
the elite of mankind there.
Saving the planet.

2199
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:46,280
So when you go on their website and see 
that,

2200
01:39:46,281 --> 01:39:48,470
they say they are the largest growing 
religion.

2201
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:50,120
They own the only ones.
What?

2202
01:39:50,121 --> 01:39:52,700
The solution to life demands.
Ils.

2203
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,250
I'm not making this up.
Okay?

2204
01:39:55,251 --> 01:39:58,430
So when you make those kinds of claims,
you

2205
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:00,350
good?
Then stand behind it.

2206
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:01,070
Say,
that's right.

2207
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:02,990
That's right.
I don't believe in other things.

2208
01:40:02,991 --> 01:40:04,940
We don't.
We think you're all lost.

2209
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:08,360
We are extremist.
We are bigots and we.

2210
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:09,830
This is what,
these are our beliefs.

2211
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,020
Then don't join us.
We obviously have enough money.

2212
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:15,050
Do you communicate with any of the 
people weren't allowed to talk to me.

2213
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:20,280
In fact,
I've seen celebrities who talk shit to 

2214
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:20,280
me on twitter and social media.
Not directly at me

2215
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:23,470
and they run from me.
They run from me at parties

2216
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:28,860
and they're lucky.
They're lucky that they run because 

2217
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:29,890
honestly I don't mind.
I don't mind you talking shit.

2218
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,350
Just when you see me back it up.
That's all.

2219
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:34,450
Just back it up.
Can you say,

2220
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:39,520
I don't want any.
I want to know why I don't want to name 

2221
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:39,520
a name Joe.
Yes,

2222
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:39,520
because I don't want to give him that 
much

2223
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,800
credit.
I don't want to give them that.

2224
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,330
You can just name any,
any celebrity that you know

2225
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:46,630
like that does a scientologist.
We would.

2226
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:47,520
We have.
We have Kirstie.

2227
01:40:47,521 --> 01:40:49,800
The alley.
We have Tom Cruise too.

2228
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:50,490
He's still in.

2229
01:40:51,070 --> 01:40:54,320
Why she me a bigot?
Yeah,

2230
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:57,810
because you don't like scientology.
Right.

2231
01:40:58,150 --> 01:41:00,430
But I wasn't a big hit when I didn't 
like anybody else.

2232
01:41:00,431 --> 01:41:01,720
What site intelligence.
Right.

2233
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:06,460
Because that's what I was very much a 
Vegan and she knows it because she is.

2234
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:12,300
She's deep friend Danny masterson.
I'm Laura Pre pon.

2235
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:15,890
He was on the 70 show.
Oh yeah,

2236
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:20,930
she's in Laura preponderance.
I'm Juliette Lewis,

2237
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:22,790
her brother,
light field.

2238
01:41:23,630 --> 01:41:26,530
Like Bill Lewis was just at a wedding,
her Juliette Lewis,

2239
01:41:26,531 --> 01:41:28,450
his brother who I grew up with.
Light field.

2240
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,350
Okay.
In the sane,

2241
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,840
intelligent community.
He was filming a wedding.

2242
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:32,780
He was a sinner,
like,

2243
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:33,700
you know,
doing the video.

2244
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:38,940
He literally ran from me and my husband 
and he was videoing the wedding.

2245
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:44,190
So whatever that shot was.
And my husband even said to him like,

2246
01:41:44,281 --> 01:41:44,860
he said,
hey,

2247
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:45,460
he goes,
hey,

2248
01:41:45,461 --> 01:41:47,170
life hill.
And he ran.

2249
01:41:47,171 --> 01:41:49,300
And the other band members because 
angels singing,

2250
01:41:49,301 --> 01:41:50,410
right?
Uh,

2251
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,510
he said,
is he okay?

2252
01:41:52,511 --> 01:41:53,560
Is He?
And he's like,

2253
01:41:53,561 --> 01:41:54,790
oh,
he's a scientologist.

2254
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:02,330
I'm ignorant as to how many celebrities 
are scientologist.

2255
01:42:02,331 --> 01:42:06,680
I don't know.
That's a weird one.

2256
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:08,180
Why?
Well,

2257
01:42:08,181 --> 01:42:10,100
because he's a musician,
you know,

2258
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:15,150
and he's like a uber creative.
You would think that person is like 

2259
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:15,200
super open mind that he comes out with a
song like,

2260
01:42:15,201 --> 01:42:18,480
I'm a loser baby.
So why don't you kill me that song.

2261
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,480
So this song,
I'm a loser.

2262
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:24,350
That's him.
Yeah,

2263
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,500
that's him.
I love that.

2264
01:42:25,501 --> 01:42:28,780
So it's back.
It's like a big hit for sure.

2265
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:29,790
One hundred percent.
Okay.

2266
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:33,950
And then this one's saying yes,
I had to leave him because he seemed to.

2267
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,310
Ish.

2268
01:42:34,530 --> 01:42:35,230
Yeah.

2269
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:41,010
Like he would be a nine inch nails.
That's Jamie.

2270
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:44,210
He wears yeezys or look at them,

2271
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,680
gave me an Indian.
Who else is in deep?

2272
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:55,700
Jenna Elfman,
right?

2273
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:57,020
Janet,
are you still in deep,

2274
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,310
deep.
Whatever happened to her.

2275
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:01,040
A child,
that big show,

2276
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:03,410
I don't know.
We all go up and down in her career is,

2277
01:43:03,411 --> 01:43:04,640
you know,
that's the thing too is like,

2278
01:43:04,641 --> 01:43:08,490
I love how the church tries to measure 
like she's a uh,

2279
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:11,360
an actress,
a past her time.

2280
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:13,370
I was like,
Oh yeah,

2281
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:15,770
I'm selling my website.
How's anyone pass their time?

2282
01:43:15,771 --> 01:43:18,180
If you're still alive and acting right.
I mean he was famous,

2283
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:21,680
but I was,
I was famous enough when I was in.

2284
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:24,470
Right now you're past your time.
That's what they're saying about you.

2285
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:25,140
Oh,
Hillary,

2286
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:27,150
that's adorable.
By the way,

2287
01:43:27,151 --> 01:43:28,390
are you can't measure pw,
,

2288
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,700
w we have an up and down career.
That's,

2289
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:32,020
but,
but I,

2290
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,860
I don't,
I don't need to work.

2291
01:43:33,861 --> 01:43:35,450
I want to work.
I love what I do.

2292
01:43:35,451 --> 01:43:37,580
I love acting.
I love making people laugh,

2293
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,520
but I don't need to do it.
Right.

2294
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,380
You only need one solid hint in your 
life.

2295
01:43:42,381 --> 01:43:45,410
You know that um,
this is my passion.

2296
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:50,440
This is something that I always wanted 
to do as far as helping people.

2297
01:43:50,601 --> 01:43:52,130
This is why I in scientology.

2298
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:56,120
I loved helping people.
It was everything to me.

2299
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:58,250
If somebody needed help,
I was there.

2300
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:03,790
I just love it.
That's why I know like to talk shit 

2301
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:07,721
about these people I know in their 
hearts they really believe they're 

2302
01:44:07,721 --> 01:44:10,901
helping even attacking me is helpful.
So I don't really want to call these 

2303
01:44:11,571 --> 01:44:16,571
people out like this specific per but,
but at least have the balls to back it 

2304
01:44:16,571 --> 01:44:17,840
up when you see me.

2305
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,920
So you believed they had just have 
misguided intentions but their 

2306
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:23,600
intentions are correct as you did at one
point in time to.

2307
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:26,770
So you're uniquely qualified.
Call anybody a liar,

2308
01:44:26,771 --> 01:44:31,771
a bigot.
I would tell the [inaudible] story is a 

2309
01:44:31,771 --> 01:44:31,771
lie.
It's crazy.

2310
01:44:31,771 --> 01:44:32,650
You sound crazy.
What is the story?

2311
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:37,980
This is the story.
This is how they got to be attached to 

2312
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:40,420
our bodies.
The new story is they got package.

2313
01:44:40,450 --> 01:44:45,450
What is it?
You can google it all into a volcano 

2314
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:45,450
that got dropped into a volcano or 
something like that.

2315
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:47,440
Yes.
They got packet like there was at planet

2316
01:44:47,441 --> 01:44:51,210
that existed like this.
It looked like this and then the,

2317
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:55,840
the,
the Lord Xenu thought that there was too

2318
01:44:55,841 --> 01:44:59,380
many people on the planet.
So we packaged all these people up.

2319
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,300
Is that Ota stuff?
No,

2320
01:45:01,301 --> 01:45:02,710
I think this is stuff.
Steps two,

2321
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,440
three.
And then what?

2322
01:45:03,441 --> 01:45:05,320
What happens?
Like at Ota,

2323
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:06,800
your mom's out now,
right?

2324
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:07,510
Yeah.
So hold on.

2325
01:45:07,511 --> 01:45:07,870
So

2326
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:11,930
you were told when the very beginning 
and scientology that you have a reactive

2327
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:16,931
mind and so in dianetics you are running
out these bad experiences that you've 

2328
01:45:18,291 --> 01:45:20,540
had maybe this lifetime,
maybe last lifetime,

2329
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:22,770
maybe lifetimes ago.
So you're,

2330
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:26,090
you're told that you have a reactive 
mind and we're going to take it away.

2331
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,190
We're going to find it and we're going 
to take it away.

2332
01:45:28,191 --> 01:45:30,440
So you don't even know that you have it 
until you're told you have it.

2333
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,200
Right.
So you run all these things,

2334
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:35,330
these incidents,
like you'll get it

2335
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:36,470
picture in your head.
Oh,

2336
01:45:36,471 --> 01:45:41,300
I'm getting a picture of that.
I was like a French medieval times,

2337
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:41,810
whatever.
They're like,

2338
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,460
that's okay.
You don't have to believe it.

2339
01:45:43,461 --> 01:45:44,960
Just say it.
Just say what it is.

2340
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:47,390
Yes.
And then I was burned at the stake.

2341
01:45:47,391 --> 01:45:52,391
I was a,
which I obviously I was in Salem and I 

2342
01:45:52,391 --> 01:45:52,391
was worried because I have a problem 
with fire,

2343
01:45:52,391 --> 01:45:53,870
you know,
and you're making up these things as you

2344
01:45:53,871 --> 01:45:55,700
go and then you're like,
I think I'm making these up.

2345
01:45:55,701 --> 01:46:00,701
And then there's a policy that says the 
person's going to say by on harbor that 

2346
01:46:00,701 --> 01:46:00,710
they're making it up,
but they're not making it up.

2347
01:46:00,711 --> 01:46:03,050
These are real pictures of real past 
lives,

2348
01:46:03,051 --> 01:46:03,980
I don't know.
Right.

2349
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:07,780
Okay.
By the time you get to Ota,

2350
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:08,980
you're told,
okay,

2351
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,380
so what wasn't true?
All of that was a law.

2352
01:46:12,381 --> 01:46:15,760
You made that up.
But what is like,

2353
01:46:15,761 --> 01:46:18,820
what aren't you?
So I'm not a,

2354
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:21,040
I'm not a body,
I'm not a

2355
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:23,500
arm.
I'm not a this,

2356
01:46:23,501 --> 01:46:25,990
I'm not.
I was never louis the.

2357
01:46:25,991 --> 01:46:30,490
I was never that guy that I said I was 
never a witch in Salem.

2358
01:46:30,491 --> 01:46:31,210
I was never.

2359
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:34,150
So That's what Ota.
So you're basically told what?

2360
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:37,240
What wasn't true?
What are you like,

2361
01:46:37,241 --> 01:46:38,740
what are you really?
I'm just me.

2362
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:40,930
Is the answer.
How did your mom get out?

2363
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:45,430
My mom got off that ship and she said,
I'm never going back.

2364
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:48,550
Why is that killing another thing?
Because you thought it was bullshit,

2365
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:49,980
but thought it was okay

2366
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,980
when you were going through your ot 
three thing and they're explaining to 

2367
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:55,240
you that you're covered with bugs that 
are beings.

2368
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,320
You're not,
not.

2369
01:46:57,490 --> 01:47:02,490
We need to go back.
Maybe I'm laughing,

2370
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:08,940
joking around a little beings that bugs 
or without a body.

2371
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:09,900
Yeah.
Okay.

2372
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:15,290
Um,
so your mom got all the way past that 

2373
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:17,400
and something she decided at one point 
in time.

2374
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,960
It's bullshit.
It wasn't for me.

2375
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:23,990
What was it that she decided?
She didn't tell me that she would have 

2376
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:25,320
told me that that would have stopped me 
from going.

2377
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:30,710
They would have pulled me in a meeting.
When did she think it was bullshit and 

2378
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:32,370
she got to the top.
She can't tell me.

2379
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,160
She thinks it's bullshit.
I'm still coming up behind her.

2380
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,390
If I.
If she then pulled me in and said,

2381
01:47:39,391 --> 01:47:40,440
Leah,
this is bullshit.

2382
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,250
I don't want you to continue.
Then I would have turned her in.

2383
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:47,090
I would have.
It would have.

2384
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,620
They would have gone to work on me and 
your mother.

2385
01:47:49,621 --> 01:47:54,621
You need to disconnect from your mother.
She didn't want me to disconnect from 

2386
01:47:54,621 --> 01:47:57,870
her is her family.
So you learned to be quiet.

2387
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:03,750
It's so complicated.
It is complicated and it takes years and

2388
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:04,260
years of this.
You don't just.

2389
01:48:04,261 --> 01:48:09,261
It doesn't happen overnight.
So your mom got to Ota so she had to go 

2390
01:48:09,261 --> 01:48:09,580
to the ship.
Yeah.

2391
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:13,110
And is it the wackiest to the wacky.
When she got there and she's like,

2392
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:14,400
this is nonsense.
I'm done.

2393
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:16,140
We're just happy to be done.
Finally,

2394
01:48:16,141 --> 01:48:18,720
it was almost like she was free.
Wow.

2395
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:20,520
Yeah.
So what happens when she left?

2396
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:21,270
Did they go,
hey,

2397
01:48:21,271 --> 01:48:24,810
where are you going after you're done?
They let you off the ship,

2398
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,190
right?
You complete it,

2399
01:48:26,191 --> 01:48:30,090
you get a cert and that's it.
You don't have to go every day anymore.

2400
01:48:30,090 --> 01:48:32,820
No,
and now created more ot levels now.

2401
01:48:32,821 --> 01:48:37,821
So she would have been called back in.
They created more like what we just went

2402
01:48:38,471 --> 01:48:40,980
into the vault,
uncovered a squirrel.

2403
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:46,340
We found some writings of l Ron Hubbard 
before he passed and I swear to God,

2404
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:49,230
it's not even a lie and you believe it.
Joe,

2405
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:51,640
don't laugh at me because I feel bad for
like,

2406
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:55,140
I feel bad for the people looking back.
I go,

2407
01:48:55,620 --> 01:49:00,620
you know,
we were all went into it like with a 

2408
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:02,160
good heart.
Like we believed what they were saying.

2409
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:02,880
It was like,
well,

2410
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:04,390
what do you mean?
You just found it.

2411
01:49:04,391 --> 01:49:09,391
Element Hubbard said it was the end of 
the bridge was Ota and we spent her 

2412
01:49:09,391 --> 01:49:13,341
whole life doing this.
Like you want there to be a definite 

2413
01:49:13,341 --> 01:49:13,341
end,
you know,

2414
01:49:13,341 --> 01:49:16,670
so I can live your life a little bit.
It's just incredible that a science 

2415
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:19,971
fiction writer could create something 
like this that's so poorly written and 

2416
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:22,900
we only knew of his science fiction 
writing,

2417
01:49:22,901 --> 01:49:25,170
like from him telling us,
but it wasn't like we were faint,

2418
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,720
new l Ron Hubbard as a science fiction 
writer.

2419
01:49:27,721 --> 01:49:32,721
It must be in some knowledge of it.
Otherwise battlefield earth would have 

2420
01:49:32,721 --> 01:49:32,721
been made.
Of course they have a whole building on,

2421
01:49:32,721 --> 01:49:32,880
on,
uh,

2422
01:49:32,881 --> 01:49:37,881
they have a whole literary building on 
Hollywood boulevard called Arthur 

2423
01:49:37,881 --> 01:49:41,070
services and it's all dedicated to 
Elbert Hubbard's publishing.

2424
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:46,290
And you walk in,
you think this man is a serious,

2425
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:46,780
right?
Like,

2426
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,190
this is somebody who was really.

2427
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:48,540
Well,

2428
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:52,750
people don't know.
He wrote more books and wrote more stuff

2429
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:56,470
than more fiction than any human being 
that's ever lived ever.

2430
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:57,460
Is that true?
Yes.

2431
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:01,910
He wrote more fiction than anyone who 
has ever walked the face of the planet.

2432
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,430
Something about his.
He made up,

2433
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,960
made up more shit than anyone who ever 
lived.

2434
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:11,590
So he wrote down more shit.
That never really happened.

2435
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:15,910
Then anyone who ever lived,
but the scientology stuff he was telling

2436
01:50:15,911 --> 01:50:16,570
the truth about.

2437
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:19,370
Right.
But you don't make that,

2438
01:50:19,371 --> 01:50:20,630
you don't think that,
you know what I'm saying?

2439
01:50:20,631 --> 01:50:22,220
You don't make that distinction.
You don't,

2440
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:27,350
you're,
you're reading dianetics because it's 

2441
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:28,970
self help book.
Like you were searching for something 

2442
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:28,970
bigger.
You know,

2443
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:33,520
most people are looking for that.
And so when you read that book and 

2444
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:33,520
you're like,
Oh,

2445
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:37,400
I could cure myself a psychosomatic ils.
And um,

2446
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:40,830
big part going clear is that it,
it,

2447
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:46,320
it seems pretty obvious that he was 
going through some issues himself and 

2448
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:46,320
he's trying to self diagnose and self

2449
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,230
himself of blindness.
He said,

2450
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:49,820
so,
and you believe it.

2451
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:50,930
You want to believe it,
Joe,

2452
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:54,140
you want to believe like I can cure 
myself of things.

2453
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:57,660
I am the cause of my own,
um,

2454
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:01,550
wellbeing by my own thoughts and I don't
want this reactive mind.

2455
01:51:01,551 --> 01:51:02,330
And,
and,

2456
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:03,470
you know,
that makes sense,

2457
01:51:03,471 --> 01:51:04,160
right?
When people say,

2458
01:51:04,170 --> 01:51:08,450
have you ever done anything that a,
is uncontrollable to you,

2459
01:51:08,451 --> 01:51:10,310
that you know is damaging to you?
And you're like,

2460
01:51:10,311 --> 01:51:15,311
yeah,
every day I don't want to make bad 

2461
01:51:15,311 --> 01:51:15,311
decisions.
Well,

2462
01:51:15,311 --> 01:51:16,490
that's because it's your reactive mind.
It's beneath you.

2463
01:51:16,491 --> 01:51:16,810
It's,
it's,

2464
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:18,650
it's,
it's in your subconscious.

2465
01:51:18,651 --> 01:51:23,651
Deep in your subconscious and we're 
gonna help you find those areas and 

2466
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:27,941
we're gonna help you to stop making bad 
decisions and who doesn't want that and 

2467
01:51:28,581 --> 01:51:29,540
you believe it.
You know,

2468
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:33,950
you go from maybe you know,
punching somebody in the face,

2469
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:38,970
you know,
for looking at you a certain way to 

2470
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:38,970
being able to control your emotions.
You're like,

2471
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:38,970
oh,
okay,

2472
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:39,260
maybe this is working.
Oh,

2473
01:51:39,261 --> 01:51:40,520
okay.
I used to do drugs.

2474
01:51:40,521 --> 01:51:41,910
Now I don't,
you know,

2475
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:43,850
encourage these cases,
saved her life.

2476
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:47,810
So she believes that it saved your life.
It saved your life.

2477
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:52,900
I'm not taking that away from her.
I'm not taking away your gains and your 

2478
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:57,131
wins,
but don't take away the fact that you 

2479
01:51:57,131 --> 01:51:59,711
know I'm telling the truth and don't 
come from me when you know I'm telling 

2480
01:51:59,711 --> 01:51:59,750
the truth because then we do have a 
fucking problem.

2481
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:00,470
That's okay.

2482
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:01,690
It seems like,
yeah,

2483
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:05,830
there are a clan you know and you are 
opposing the clan.

2484
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:08,960
They know it's true.
I have a listen.

2485
01:52:08,961 --> 01:52:10,430
If you didn't know it was true,
then I'd be like,

2486
01:52:10,431 --> 01:52:11,240
oh,
she's done aware.

2487
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:13,280
She knows it's true.
So to come from me,

2488
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:15,770
it's kind of crazy.
It is kind of crazy,

2489
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:16,460
right?
Like what?

2490
01:52:16,461 --> 01:52:18,920
What is the predominant criticism 
amongst these people?

2491
01:52:18,921 --> 01:52:20,450
They're not.
They can't say you're lying,

2492
01:52:20,451 --> 01:52:21,240
right?
Uh,

2493
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:21,890
yes.
They say,

2494
01:52:21,891 --> 01:52:24,650
I'm lying baby.
Not just me.

2495
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:29,680
We're all lying.
Any person who's spoken out against the 

2496
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:31,070
church is lying.
We are bigots.

2497
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:36,110
We are invalidating their religious 
beliefs.

2498
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:41,140
We are.
I'm telling them that something didn't 

2499
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:41,140
help them.
We're not.

2500
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:41,610
Nobody's saying that.
Nobody's said,

2501
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:46,660
if you feel you've been helped,
you've been held however you know the 

2502
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:50,450
truth and now you have a responsibility.
But what they think is,

2503
01:52:50,451 --> 01:52:52,970
I don't want to have a problem.
Scientology helps me.

2504
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,170
And so that's all I care about.

2505
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:59,170
So you don't give a shit about abuses.
You don't care that children were being 

2506
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:00,440
molested and these things were being 
hidden.

2507
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:02,960
You don't care that were being molested.
Honey,

2508
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:04,910
if you even just google that,
what I just said,

2509
01:53:04,911 --> 01:53:08,780
scientology and Traumas,
you will come upon website after website

2510
01:53:08,781 --> 01:53:09,800
of,
of people saying,

2511
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:13,250
I was molested while I was in the church
and the church did nothing about it.

2512
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,760
I'm not alleging it.
This is what I've read,

2513
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:18,310
this is what I've seen,
right?

2514
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:20,390
Um,
and I've been in.

2515
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:21,980
I hadn't heard that.
Okay,

2516
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:22,720
well,
you're going to,

2517
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:23,900
you,
you can hear it.

2518
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:28,930
You're going to hear it because people 
are becoming more and more vocal about 

2519
01:53:28,930 --> 01:53:32,381
what's happened to them.
And so if I seem overly passionate about

2520
01:53:34,191 --> 01:53:39,191
this subject,
it's because I have heard these stories 

2521
01:53:39,191 --> 01:53:43,330
over and over again behind the scenes.
I have heard stories of people being 

2522
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:44,570
abused,
children being abused mentally,

2523
01:53:44,571 --> 01:53:45,770
physically,
sexually,

2524
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:49,910
and I'm only me with a show,
you know,

2525
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:52,160
a,
and he can't do anything other than just

2526
01:53:52,161 --> 01:53:54,020
let me tell these stories,
right?

2527
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:54,750
Um,
so,

2528
01:53:54,751 --> 01:53:55,790
um,
virtually,

2529
01:53:56,230 --> 01:53:57,530
um,
and,

2530
01:53:57,531 --> 01:54:00,880
and Mike Rinder and other avenues that 
we,

2531
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:05,910
we really can't talk about.
I'm trying to do something right by 

2532
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:08,981
these people.
And so the last thing that I want to be 

2533
01:54:08,981 --> 01:54:10,880
bothered with his bullshit from a 
celebrity who knows that,

2534
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:16,310
um,
we're telling the truth about what we 

2535
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:18,311
have already spoken about,
but to be interested enough to maybe 

2536
01:54:18,311 --> 01:54:19,910
find out what I am talking about now.
Right?

2537
01:54:21,050 --> 01:54:24,580
The granite one is really odd because 
she's a newsperson.

2538
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:28,370
She's supposed to be a television news 
journalists,

2539
01:54:28,371 --> 01:54:29,000
right?
I mean,

2540
01:54:29,001 --> 01:54:29,860
isn't that what she does?

2541
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,880
Um,
yes.

2542
01:54:31,881 --> 01:54:32,630
But why,
what,

2543
01:54:32,631 --> 01:54:33,260
why is that?

2544
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:38,420
Because I would just assume like you 
would want your news from someone who 

2545
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,390
doesn't believe a bunch of wacky shit.

2546
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:42,300
Well that I'm in her defense.
I mean,

2547
01:54:42,301 --> 01:54:47,301
who,
who knows what I need a person believes 

2548
01:54:47,301 --> 01:54:47,301
true.
Um,

2549
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:52,310
however,
the distinction that I'm glad you did 

2550
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:53,880
make is when you are hearing about 
abuses,

2551
01:54:53,881 --> 01:54:57,360
when you were hearing about things that 
are happening that are hurting people,

2552
01:54:57,750 --> 01:55:01,110
you then do need to say,
I'm aligned with this organization.

2553
01:55:01,111 --> 01:55:03,720
And so I do need to find out how long 
has she been in it?

2554
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,160
I think most of her life.

2555
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:07,060
There's a lot of people like that,
right?

2556
01:55:07,061 --> 01:55:12,061
You get indoctrinated as a child.
Have you received emails or any sort of 

2557
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,600
contact from people who your show 
benefited and it,

2558
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:17,260
it was the catalyst for them leaving

2559
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:18,790
a lot?
No.

2560
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:19,620
For leaving.
No.

2561
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:24,830
Have A.
we've received tons of emails of people 

2562
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:25,800
who said,
I'm glad you told me that.

2563
01:55:25,810 --> 01:55:28,510
I'm glad I watched your show.
I am well informed now.

2564
01:55:28,511 --> 01:55:31,990
I will never step into a church of 
scientology.

2565
01:55:32,590 --> 01:55:36,280
Um,
what about people leaving because you're

2566
01:55:36,281 --> 01:55:38,230
not getting some intelligence watching 
the show,

2567
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:40,190
right?
You know,

2568
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:41,460
they have shows,
right?

2569
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:43,890
They have to be on the front.
Well,

2570
01:55:43,891 --> 01:55:48,891
average scientologists do,
but they're not watching shows like 

2571
01:55:48,891 --> 01:55:48,891
this.
They'd have to pay for that.

2572
01:55:48,891 --> 01:55:49,650
Literally,
Joe,

2573
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:54,651
like you'd have to go in the next day 
and pay to have your own interrogation 

2574
01:55:54,651 --> 01:55:55,710
and punishment handed to you for 
watching a show like ours.

2575
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,580
We're going clear after awhile.
You just go,

2576
01:55:58,581 --> 01:56:03,581
I don't want the punishment.
Especially if you believe that I am the 

2577
01:56:03,661 --> 01:56:06,540
devil.
If you believe that I'm a liar,

2578
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,830
that I have crossed over to another side
that I'm not to be listened to.

2579
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:15,570
Why would you support somebody who was 
talking shit about you and your faith or

2580
01:56:15,571 --> 01:56:20,571
your family and people you love?
Would you out of your way to listen to 

2581
01:56:20,571 --> 01:56:23,301
them maybe,
but the average person doesn't want to 

2582
01:56:23,301 --> 01:56:24,660
seek out things that they think are 
damaging.

2583
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:30,620
What kind of blowback have you received 
from this and what kind of blowback 

2584
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:33,821
back?
Because a guy like Paul Haggis are 

2585
01:56:33,821 --> 01:56:33,821
Lawrence Wright or of,

2586
01:56:33,821 --> 01:56:37,180
well,
Paul had to watch his family go on his 

2587
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:40,190
website that the Church of scientology 
created and watch his family talk about 

2588
01:56:40,190 --> 01:56:44,621
him disconnect because they're still in 
disconnect from him as every single 

2589
01:56:45,561 --> 01:56:47,990
person who's been on this show,
um,

2590
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,030
they've been followed.
They'd been harassed,

2591
01:56:50,031 --> 01:56:52,430
they'd been,
they pi is following them.

2592
01:56:52,431 --> 01:56:54,350
They have people showing up at their 
jobs.

2593
01:56:55,190 --> 01:56:57,950
They're getting mail of like people who 
are,

2594
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:03,520
people who don't even have never stepped
into a church or getting mail connected 

2595
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:05,630
to me,
mail at their house,

2596
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:08,900
like have never stepped into a church of
scientology.

2597
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:11,350
The girl does my eyebrows.
She's like,

2598
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:12,920
I don't know.
I said,

2599
01:57:12,921 --> 01:57:13,980
you,
you'd never substitute.

2600
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:15,080
She said,
never.

2601
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:18,080
She's getting mail for the first time 
for the Church of Scientology.

2602
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:19,940
It's just crazy.
But that,

2603
01:57:19,941 --> 01:57:22,970
that,
that's just a little anecdote but that,

2604
01:57:23,450 --> 01:57:27,800
but to have your family make videos of 
you,

2605
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:31,490
to not talk to you,
to refuse to see you,

2606
01:57:31,491 --> 01:57:34,430
you're their own grandchildren.
Um,

2607
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:37,640
that,
that's just something I can't deal with.

2608
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:42,700
But also now what we're,
what I'm dealing with now is hearing 

2609
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:46,250
stories of these people who have been 
silenced for years,

2610
01:57:46,251 --> 01:57:51,251
the pain that they've,
they've had to deal with and sustain 

2611
01:57:51,251 --> 01:57:53,720
through these years effect that they're 
normal in any way is a miracle.

2612
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:59,440
Um,
and so I hope to do something with them 

2613
01:57:59,440 --> 01:57:59,440
and I hope to make some changes.

2614
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:04,700
What,
what are the positive aspects of 

2615
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:07,931
scientology and how do you think it 
benefited you and do you think it's 

2616
01:58:07,931 --> 01:58:11,471
possible to take some of those positive 
aspects and either reform that 

2617
01:58:12,531 --> 01:58:16,850
organization or form another 
organization that doesn't try to control

2618
01:58:16,851 --> 01:58:21,851
people's thinking but maybe positive,
maybe tries to encourage the positive 

2619
01:58:21,981 --> 01:58:24,170
benefits of being a part of a group,

2620
01:58:24,450 --> 01:58:27,650
promote anything good about it.
Because I know it's an Olin proposition,

2621
01:58:27,710 --> 01:58:28,730
right?
But isn't it?

2622
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:30,380
But isn't there some,

2623
01:58:30,570 --> 01:58:33,900
Hey ben read books.
You can buy the books if you want to buy

2624
01:58:33,901 --> 01:58:34,620
the books.
But I,

2625
01:58:34,621 --> 01:58:35,900
I mean,
I don't think there's,

2626
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:37,020
I,
you know,

2627
01:58:37,050 --> 01:58:39,540
go into a therapist now when I bring up 
concepts and she's like,

2628
01:58:39,541 --> 01:58:40,890
Oh yeah,
that was in psychology.

2629
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:42,170
Psych one.

2630
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:43,450
I'm like,
what does that.

2631
01:58:43,460 --> 01:58:46,420
A lot of it is from this existed,

2632
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:49,110
so yeah,
but I,

2633
01:58:49,111 --> 01:58:50,320
I believe in,
in,

2634
01:58:50,350 --> 01:58:52,510
uh,
I'm finding things that work for you.

2635
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:57,600
I don't think it's one thing.
The one thing that my therapist me is 

2636
01:58:57,600 --> 01:58:58,330
that it's not just one thing,
you know,

2637
01:58:58,331 --> 01:59:00,460
you get something from here,
you get something from there.

2638
01:59:00,461 --> 01:59:03,480
It's knowledge is scientology is not 
about knowledges.

2639
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:04,510
It's about us

2640
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:06,840
in this therapy thing is very new to 
you.

2641
01:59:06,841 --> 01:59:09,720
You never went through any.
My first thing that I said to her is,

2642
01:59:09,721 --> 01:59:11,700
I just want you to know that I think I 
know more than you.

2643
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:13,650
I was taught,
I was taught as a sign

2644
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:18,680
intelligence that you are,
you have wasted your life going to 

2645
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:18,680
college.
Uh,

2646
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:23,301
I could do for a person and five minutes
on this emitter what you're going to do 

2647
01:59:23,301 --> 01:59:23,940
with me in it,
you know,

2648
01:59:24,510 --> 01:59:25,790
in five years.
Like,

2649
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:27,990
what did your therapist say?
I understand,

2650
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,990
I understand.
I understand that you feel that way.

2651
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:32,910
And she said,
uh,

2652
01:59:32,911 --> 01:59:33,860
you know,
that um,

2653
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:38,370
spirituality and religion should have 
nothing to do with the ego.

2654
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:42,180
Would like that stayed with me for a 
second because I was like,

2655
01:59:42,210 --> 01:59:43,920
I have a huge ego.
She's right.

2656
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:49,460
She's right.
Scientologists believe that they have 

2657
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:52,701
the answers and when you believe that 
you have shut yourself off to a.

2658
01:59:53,070 --> 01:59:56,520
The fruits of our observation to 
experiencing other people,

2659
01:59:56,521 --> 01:59:59,910
to opening your heart up to things.
I mean it's.

2660
02:00:00,510 --> 02:00:02,070
It shuts you off completely.

2661
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:07,090
So you feel like this is a part of you 
that you're really exploring or 

2662
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:09,350
exploring maybe for the first time.
Non Cologne thing is like,

2663
02:00:09,351 --> 02:00:12,740
I'm so judgy about it,
but I'm willing to maybe change my mind.

2664
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:19,030
My Non Cologne thing.
I'm sure you've seen that video of Tom 

2665
02:00:19,030 --> 02:00:23,380
Cruise,
the where it's got the mission 

2666
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:23,380
impossible sort of soundtrack playing in
the background.

2667
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:25,430
He's talking about a car accident.
Have you stumbled upon a car accident?

2668
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:30,610
Like you know that you were the one of 
us take care of it because you're a 

2669
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:31,000
scientologist.
You're the only one that can handle that

2670
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:32,570
and and you believe that when you're 
assigned,

2671
02:00:32,571 --> 02:00:37,380
told you you are not only you are taught
that we are the only ones doing anything

2672
02:00:37,381 --> 02:00:38,910
that you are.
The only ones,

2673
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:44,240
that's why it was so shocking to me when
no one in my church is willing to stand 

2674
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:44,240
with me.
I was like,

2675
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:48,441
wow,
so we are not those people who stand up 

2676
02:00:48,441 --> 02:00:51,260
right where we are,
the people who look the other way 

2677
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:51,330
because you're all looking the other way
because the time,

2678
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:55,470
because of David Miscavige,
because you have no balls really,

2679
02:00:55,740 --> 02:01:00,740
are we those people?
Because the truth of the matter is when 

2680
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:00,740
there was an accident,
Joe,

2681
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:01,290
I did stop.
I am.

2682
02:01:01,291 --> 02:01:02,710
That person has stopped since then.

2683
02:01:02,990 --> 02:01:05,390
That's one of the positive benefits of 
scientology.

2684
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:11,160
Well,
you feel that you're responsible for 

2685
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:11,160
everything and you felt like you wanted 
help as well.

2686
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:15,710
Oh,
we felt he could help and you wanted to 

2687
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:15,710
help.
That's a positive thing,

2688
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:15,710
right?
Right.

2689
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:16,250
And also intelligence.
Do you think they're healthy?

2690
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,140
Right.
So there's gotta be some.

2691
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:22,550
Like one of the things that I've found 
about a lot of scientologists ego,

2692
02:01:22,610 --> 02:01:25,670
so if you think you're the only one 
doing anything,

2693
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:28,220
by the way,
there are other people who stopped,

2694
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:33,460
but I believe in my heart I believed 
that it was because I was a 

2695
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:35,990
scientologist that I stopped,
but then I saw in life I was like,

2696
02:01:35,991 --> 02:01:37,640
wait a minute.
There's good people in the world.

2697
02:01:37,641 --> 02:01:41,240
They have no interest,
no ulterior motive,

2698
02:01:41,241 --> 02:01:46,241
no vested interest in helping somebody 
right there do like.

2699
02:01:46,281 --> 02:01:50,420
I'm more shocked like what the show.
That's why like in in the last episode,

2700
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:51,110
I was in tears.

2701
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:56,110
I was a mess because I was shocked by 
the goodness of people that I thought 

2702
02:01:56,110 --> 02:02:00,971
the world was so screwed because of 
scientology because I thought we were 

2703
02:02:01,851 --> 02:02:04,940
the only good people in the world.
Do you see what I'm saying?

2704
02:02:04,941 --> 02:02:06,650
I so,
so stupid and juvenile.

2705
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:12,250
It doesn't though.
It completely makes sense and honestly 

2706
02:02:12,250 --> 02:02:16,480
from someone who's lived their entire 
life indoctrinated in that I ideology 

2707
02:02:16,701 --> 02:02:18,780
and you've only been out for four years,
you're.

2708
02:02:18,970 --> 02:02:23,970
You're showing a remarkable amount of 
self insight and a remarkable amount of 

2709
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:30,970
ability to examine the flaws of your 
past thinking and current and current.

2710
02:02:32,931 --> 02:02:34,190
Yeah,
because everyday I'm like,

2711
02:02:34,191 --> 02:02:39,191
that's really messed up.
But to abandon the foundation that 

2712
02:02:39,191 --> 02:02:39,800
you've kind of established your entire 
life on,

2713
02:02:39,801 --> 02:02:44,801
it's got to be insanely difficult.
And to do it in your forties after all 

2714
02:02:44,801 --> 02:02:46,820
these years of being involved in this 
crazy sort of organization,

2715
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,220
it's very,
it's very admirable.

2716
02:02:49,221 --> 02:02:54,221
It's very hard.
It would be way easier for you to just 

2717
02:02:54,221 --> 02:02:54,221
keep,
stay in,

2718
02:02:54,221 --> 02:02:57,050
stay inside your comfort zone,
keep doing all your nonsense,

2719
02:02:57,260 --> 02:03:00,110
get up to 55 or whatever the fuck it is 
now,

2720
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:02,110
you know,
and just a key.

2721
02:03:02,111 --> 02:03:04,540
Paying the money and keep your friends 
right now.

2722
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:06,440
Do you miss any of your friends that 
were in it?

2723
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:09,570
Um,
no.

2724
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:11,580
I only miss,
um,

2725
02:03:11,790 --> 02:03:14,670
the children have,
um,

2726
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:17,760
like my goddaughter and you know,
because I see her,

2727
02:03:17,761 --> 02:03:19,970
she lives in my neighborhood and she 
can't talk to you.

2728
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:22,800
Well her mother can't talk to me.
She doesn't know me now.

2729
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:25,410
I delivered her,
you know,

2730
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:31,570
deliver the hospital and then I moved.
We moved my friend close to me down the 

2731
02:03:32,431 --> 02:03:37,431
street so she could be in a certain 
school district and then I'd be able to 

2732
02:03:37,431 --> 02:03:41,361
be my goddaughter and a,
I see her in the neighborhood and she 

2733
02:03:41,361 --> 02:03:43,830
can't talk to me.
So the,

2734
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:44,850
the,
you know,

2735
02:03:44,851 --> 02:03:49,851
that my car door doesn't know me.
She wouldn't know to come to me because 

2736
02:03:49,851 --> 02:03:51,270
she's now only,
you know,

2737
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:51,930
five,
six,

2738
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:54,100
you know what I'm saying?
Um,

2739
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:57,600
how were they hanging on?
How do they,

2740
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:00,300
how do they stand a mess?
$3,000,000,000

2741
02:04:00,301 --> 02:04:02,130
in assets.
Three billion.

2742
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:04,980
Yes.
And so it takes,

2743
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:09,580
it's gonna take a few good men and women
to stand up with us and,

2744
02:04:09,590 --> 02:04:11,040
and,
and get interested.

2745
02:04:11,070 --> 02:04:12,060
You know,
like I said,

2746
02:04:12,061 --> 02:04:15,810
there's been a few public figures to,
to publicly come out.

2747
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:18,270
You're now one of them.
Conan is another one.

2748
02:04:18,271 --> 02:04:19,320
And,
and you know,

2749
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:21,840
Bill Maher,
like there's some people with some balls

2750
02:04:21,841 --> 02:04:24,030
that are willing to say this is 
bullshit.

2751
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:29,100
We should be doing something about it.
The world at large is supportive of,

2752
02:04:29,370 --> 02:04:32,160
of me and the people who are 
contributing to the show.

2753
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:36,030
Amazingly supportive.
Social media has been amazing to us,

2754
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:37,410
um,
and,

2755
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:42,470
and as well and eat very brave to do a 
show like this at first time of it's 

2756
02:04:42,470 --> 02:04:43,740
kind,
I mean a series about it.

2757
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:46,140
Um,
it took some bowls and their part,

2758
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:49,890
they pussied out with disclaimers but 
okay.

2759
02:04:50,050 --> 02:04:52,610
I think they probably had to do that for
you don't need to defend them.

2760
02:04:56,210 --> 02:05:01,210
Um,
so I think more and more people are 

2761
02:05:01,210 --> 02:05:01,300
coming out and more and more people are 
being supportive,

2762
02:05:01,301 --> 02:05:04,750
but we need more people in the public 
eye to say this isn't enough.

2763
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:05,440
We need to do something.

2764
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:08,620
What has it been like doing press for 
this and promoting it?

2765
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:12,690
Like what have been the varied reactions
from people that you've talked to?

2766
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:14,190
It's,
I've been varied.

2767
02:05:14,191 --> 02:05:18,700
It's been very supportive and beyond.
Touched by it.

2768
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:21,040
Like I didn't know what I was going to 
get.

2769
02:05:21,130 --> 02:05:24,400
I didn't know if I was going to get 
people who were gonna,

2770
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:26,710
you know,
kind of walk the line and go,

2771
02:05:26,711 --> 02:05:27,820
well,
I don't know.

2772
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:32,940
You know,
the one problem I had was with them 

2773
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:32,940
because I felt,
you know,

2774
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:34,570
Dan knew enough.
Dan was provided with enough.

2775
02:05:34,571 --> 02:05:36,730
We've talked to him enough,
Dan Harris,

2776
02:05:37,070 --> 02:05:41,110
you know,
from 20 years isn't like cut out.

2777
02:05:41,111 --> 02:05:43,090
I was like,
we can't be impartial about things.

2778
02:05:43,091 --> 02:05:44,830
We shouldn't be impartial about like,
come on.

2779
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:47,200
There's things in the world you need to 
stand up to.

2780
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:50,020
Right?
And I want people to feel that power,

2781
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:55,200
whether it's this cold or other cults or
I'm a political party or agenda.

2782
02:05:57,011 --> 02:05:59,170
Like I feel people have the power to do 
something.

2783
02:05:59,171 --> 02:06:03,790
I think that's becoming more and more 
evident and I think people need to start

2784
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:05,320
standing up for what they believe in.

2785
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:07,960
They can do something and we get asked 
that all the time.

2786
02:06:07,961 --> 02:06:08,980
Like what can I do?
I say,

2787
02:06:08,981 --> 02:06:11,020
call your congressman,
call them and say,

2788
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:14,290
I want you to look into this.
I want you to do something about this.

2789
02:06:14,291 --> 02:06:15,820
If you're a lawyer who could do 
something,

2790
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:20,880
you should contact us.
If you're somebody who has a knowledge 

2791
02:06:22,301 --> 02:06:25,840
of something that that could,
could help us prosecute you need to come

2792
02:06:25,841 --> 02:06:30,841
forward.
Because a lot of the stories that we 

2793
02:06:30,841 --> 02:06:33,841
told the statute of limitations on these
abuses have already passed and it's 

2794
02:06:33,851 --> 02:06:35,610
their words against,
you know,

2795
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:37,150
a hundred others,
like let's say,

2796
02:06:37,151 --> 02:06:40,660
uh,
we walked in right now to that base that

2797
02:06:40,661 --> 02:06:43,510
I was telling you about.
Most of them wouldn't leave.

2798
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:47,560
They don't know what's going on out 
here,

2799
02:06:47,561 --> 02:06:52,561
baby.
They don't know that what's they're 

2800
02:06:52,561 --> 02:06:53,440
being told is not happening.
You know what I mean?

2801
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:56,320
So,
uh,

2802
02:06:56,321 --> 02:07:01,321
I would love to do that.
I'd love to walk into those gates with 

2803
02:07:01,321 --> 02:07:01,321
the FBI and say,
Hey,

2804
02:07:01,321 --> 02:07:03,670
you all who want to come with me,
come with me now and we're going to take

2805
02:07:03,671 --> 02:07:05,000
care of you.
Um,

2806
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:06,760
and I've asked Mike Rinder that many 
times.

2807
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:07,490
Like I said,
they probably,

2808
02:07:07,540 --> 02:07:10,090
they won't go with you.
I'll stand there and say,

2809
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,650
what are you talking about?
You know,

2810
02:07:11,651 --> 02:07:13,090
you've been beaten.
I beat you,

2811
02:07:13,091 --> 02:07:14,480
you beat me.
He beat,

2812
02:07:14,481 --> 02:07:15,550
you know,
people were saying,

2813
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:16,180
well,
yes,

2814
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:21,200
he,
he had to rub some people up and he 

2815
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:21,200
admits it in the show.

2816
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:21,820
But not you,
you didn't beat anybody.

2817
02:07:22,990 --> 02:07:24,760
You have to smack anybody around me.
And in general,

2818
02:07:24,761 --> 02:07:29,761
because I did shit,
I haven't been into a few fights and 

2819
02:07:29,761 --> 02:07:29,761
clubs.
You've been in fights in clubs,

2820
02:07:30,610 --> 02:07:34,050
but you don't drink?
Well I did drink joe.

2821
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:35,820
You did bad while you were in,

2822
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,780
in the group and you got lit up and 
crack some people.

2823
02:07:41,170 --> 02:07:42,910
Yeah.
But that's because I'm from Brooklyn.

2824
02:07:43,390 --> 02:07:45,010
Um,
I blame.

2825
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:46,980
I blamed Brooklyn,
blame Brooklyn.

2826
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:52,120
That's strange.
I don't blame anybody but myself and my 

2827
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:53,740
bad attitude.
But did they ever make you smack anybody

2828
02:07:53,741 --> 02:07:54,880
or anything like that?
No,

2829
02:07:54,881 --> 02:07:56,770
it's not about snacking.
It's about.

2830
02:07:56,771 --> 02:07:57,910
But he had to do that,
right?

2831
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:02,940
He had a beat people.
David miscavige and this is what they 

2832
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:03,730
have said.
And they said it under oath.

2833
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,440
I'm David miscavige under his direction 
has,

2834
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:09,400
um,
and they,

2835
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:11,140
and they had admitted to that.
Um,

2836
02:08:11,290 --> 02:08:16,290
but were they admitted it?
They'd be 20 people who said they're 

2837
02:08:16,290 --> 02:08:18,100
lying.
And I was just like a punishment thing,

2838
02:08:18,101 --> 02:08:20,450
whether they're flogging these people or
it's like a,

2839
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:23,770
they had a policy called overboarding 
when the ship was,

2840
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:28,920
um,
where the sea org and they went 

2841
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:28,920
overboard.

2842
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:29,470
Somebody who was out of lunch throw them
overboard.

2843
02:08:29,530 --> 02:08:31,720
Correct.
And so now you tossed them in the water,

2844
02:08:31,770 --> 02:08:36,770
right?
And so now you don't have overboarding 

2845
02:08:36,770 --> 02:08:36,770
because you don't have ship.
Right.

2846
02:08:36,770 --> 02:08:39,910
But when you say them the water,
they pull them back out or fuck you.

2847
02:08:41,290 --> 02:08:43,420
I'm sure they throw him a line.
I'm sure you know.

2848
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:48,930
Yes,
they got back on the boat but it was a 

2849
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:50,611
form of punishment and now they've just 
assimilated that to be like,

2850
02:08:51,101 --> 02:08:56,101
we don't have a boat so it might as well
crack him in the mouth or break his 

2851
02:08:56,101 --> 02:08:56,101
fingers.
You don't have a boat anymore?

2852
02:08:56,101 --> 02:09:00,180
No.
Well they had the free winds but they 

2853
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:00,180
don't have a seaward ship like they used
to.

2854
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:01,810
Now they have bases,
you know,

2855
02:09:01,930 --> 02:09:03,520
celebrity center.
I don't know.

2856
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:08,640
Celebrity Center.
They have been mentioned that a big 

2857
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:08,640
factor like what happened to the boat?

2858
02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:13,770
Why are you obsessed with the boat?
Because like would be a cool thing to 

2859
02:09:13,770 --> 02:09:15,160
own on the old cytology boat going 
parties?

2860
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:15,960
No,
this is.

2861
02:09:15,961 --> 02:09:18,430
This is where they told the people about
ot search right in here.

2862
02:09:18,670 --> 02:09:20,530
Okay.
Do you remember what I said?

2863
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:23,080
There was the Apollo.
Okay.

2864
02:09:23,081 --> 02:09:24,050
Joe,
do we need to.

2865
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:29,820
It was a boat.
That's what started this called the 

2866
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:33,781
Apollo.
Where they give Ota is called the 

2867
02:09:33,781 --> 02:09:35,390
freelance.
They still have that boat.

2868
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,620
The boat's still around that both still 
around.

2869
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:41,410
So you can buy that book probably in the
Bahamas.

2870
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:42,670
Oh,
that's where they go.

2871
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:47,730
It's a good place to party and learn 
about the fountains and it's not 

2872
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:48,910
partying.
Oh,

2873
02:09:48,911 --> 02:09:49,500
okay.
Yeah.

2874
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:50,950
No partying at all.
No,

2875
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:54,100
but when they do have a party,
because they have a big old celebration,

2876
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:57,790
like I saw the one celebration,
I would go to the gala every,

2877
02:09:57,910 --> 02:10:01,390
every year and yet the celebrity center.
And what,

2878
02:10:01,391 --> 02:10:02,440
uh,
what happens there?

2879
02:10:02,610 --> 02:10:07,610
A with listening to speeches about how 
much scientology is accepted in the 

2880
02:10:07,610 --> 02:10:11,041
community by the lapd and talks lapd a 
bunch of money to the parents.

2881
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:14,350
Yes.
They give,

2882
02:10:14,410 --> 02:10:19,410
they give.
They started a thing called the police 

2883
02:10:19,410 --> 02:10:19,410
activities fund a leak.
Sorry.

2884
02:10:19,410 --> 02:10:24,331
The police at night and I contributed to
it and I helped it and they put on a 

2885
02:10:24,331 --> 02:10:27,880
show for the kids every Christmas at 
celebrity center and they give them 

2886
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:30,370
money.
The proceeds to what they created,

2887
02:10:30,371 --> 02:10:32,470
which is called the police activities 
league.

2888
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,070
And they

2889
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:37,100
present the,
the only pd with money for children.

2890
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:37,970
Well,
it sounds great.

2891
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:39,220
It's great,
but it's,

2892
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:41,300
listen,
it's purposeful.

2893
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:44,660
There's a policy called safe pointing,
uh,

2894
02:10:44,661 --> 02:10:46,160
the community and that's what they're 
doing.

2895
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:48,530
And I did it.
So I know what it's about.

2896
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:53,740
Right?
You appear as if your intentions are 

2897
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:57,641
pure so that you then have maybe favors 
like this happening where somebody files

2898
02:10:57,681 --> 02:11:00,170
a police report and you get screwed 
with.

2899
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:06,410
Where do you think this is going?
Where do you,

2900
02:11:06,411 --> 02:11:09,980
where do you anticipate your ballet?
I don't have a battle.

2901
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:13,280
I hope that we kind of do.
Um,

2902
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:16,340
no because I,
Joe,

2903
02:11:16,341 --> 02:11:19,040
if you received the calls that I 
receive,

2904
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:22,570
like when,
when I'm not working on the show because

2905
02:11:22,571 --> 02:11:24,830
you know,
I'm an executive producer of the show so

2906
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:29,510
they're not safe to just call anybody.
Then I'm going to call and it's my,

2907
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:30,410
me and Mike.

2908
02:11:30,420 --> 02:11:35,420
It's were the ones who have to vet these
stories and kind of a,

2909
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:40,660
people trust us because they know we're 
telling the truth and they know that we 

2910
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:43,250
have their best interest at heart and 
telling the story correctly.

2911
02:11:45,180 --> 02:11:49,490
And when you talked to these people,
when I talked to them behind the scenes,

2912
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:52,400
it takes every piece of me not to break 
down.

2913
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:56,720
I have to be kind of a their auditor,
you know what I mean?

2914
02:11:56,721 --> 02:11:59,300
There's scientology auditor to keep my 
shit together.

2915
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:02,960
But when I hang up on devastated by it,
I'm devastated by it.

2916
02:12:02,990 --> 02:12:03,470
Like,
Oh,

2917
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:05,270
I've been part of this thing.
You know what I mean?

2918
02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:08,140
Like I'm getting teary eyed talking 
about now many people are in it,

2919
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:11,120
maybe 10,000
worldwide.

2920
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:16,660
Well it gives the appearance because I 
thought like at these big events to the 

2921
02:12:19,191 --> 02:12:20,780
shrine auditorium that they have every 
year,

2922
02:12:20,781 --> 02:12:21,080
right?

2923
02:12:21,110 --> 02:12:26,110
They show what scientology is doing and 
they use things like hundreds of 

2924
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:28,910
millions and these really kind of 
electrifying statistics.

2925
02:12:28,911 --> 02:12:33,911
Right?
And we bought this building when we 

2926
02:12:33,911 --> 02:12:34,820
bought that building and that would 
indicate growth.

2927
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:37,370
Right.
That's the subliminal message to you.

2928
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,380
You know,
there's people in there,

2929
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:43,580
but there are just buildings and.
But you believe that those buildings are

2930
02:12:43,581 --> 02:12:47,090
being.
Well they have to do for tax purposes.

2931
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:49,340
Right.
And the appearance that it's growing,

2932
02:12:50,090 --> 02:12:55,090
but it's.
But they have to get offload some of 

2933
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:55,490
this money.
Do you have an endgame with all this?

2934
02:12:55,550 --> 02:13:00,550
My end game is just to tell these 
people's stories to validate that their 

2935
02:13:01,281 --> 02:13:06,281
pain is real.
I'm not going to let the church bully 

2936
02:13:06,281 --> 02:13:07,880
them or scientology bully them into 
believing that they made it up,

2937
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:12,320
that they're out to get money or fame.
You don't make money doing this show.

2938
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:15,970
I'm not saying how long are you doing it
for like,

2939
02:13:16,270 --> 02:13:17,090
I don't know.

2940
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:18,470
I don't know.
I really.

2941
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:23,590
How many episodes have you done?
We've only done eight and then two 

2942
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:23,590
specials.
You know,

2943
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:23,590
like some,
you know,

2944
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:27,380
the reddit specials that we've done,
but you know,

2945
02:13:27,381 --> 02:13:32,070
there's a whole other,
there's a lot of stories to be told.

2946
02:13:32,071 --> 02:13:36,270
I didn't even scratch the surface.
So how many stores are we going to tell?

2947
02:13:36,271 --> 02:13:37,830
I don't know.
What's my end game?

2948
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:40,200
My end game is that these stories get 
out there,

2949
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:43,080
that people get incensed enough where 
this church,

2950
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:48,160
well I have to call him your church.
This organization is held responsible 

2951
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:51,360
for the things that they have done.
And um,

2952
02:13:51,361 --> 02:13:53,340
they stop destroying families.
I mean,

2953
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:55,690
there's so many tiers to it that I 
don't,

2954
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:57,960
I don't know where it ends,
I don't know where it ends,

2955
02:13:58,030 --> 02:14:01,350
but somebody,
no plan as far as I know

2956
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:04,470
going to stop hurting people.
That's it.

2957
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:06,780
You're going to stay.
You're going to take some responsibility

2958
02:14:06,781 --> 02:14:09,510
for what you've done.
These stories are real.

2959
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:14,600
These are not liars.
People don't say they were hurt and 

2960
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:17,691
molested.
They don't go on television for fame to 

2961
02:14:17,691 --> 02:14:17,910
it.
They don't get money from doing that.

2962
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:19,960
They don't get money from doing that.
Now,

2963
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:22,160
who wants to go on television and say,
uh,

2964
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:24,630
I was coerced into getting an abortion 
and,

2965
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:25,440
and,
and who,

2966
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:26,760
who,
who does that for fame?

2967
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,020
Really,
Joe,

2968
02:14:28,850 --> 02:14:30,270
I was hit.
I was abused.

2969
02:14:30,271 --> 02:14:32,790
I was sexually molested.
I allowed this to happen.

2970
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:35,490
These things are not easy for people to 
admit to.

2971
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:37,140
Right?
You know,

2972
02:14:37,141 --> 02:14:39,270
you think it's easy for me to say I was,
you know,

2973
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:43,380
I believed in this my whole life that my
mother believed in it her whole life,

2974
02:14:43,381 --> 02:14:46,380
that my stuff we gave our life to this 
thing.

2975
02:14:46,900 --> 02:14:47,980
Well,
you're very fortunate.

2976
02:14:47,981 --> 02:14:52,981
Your mother made it out to God.
I've been here a little time and I'm 

2977
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:52,981
sweating.
No,

2978
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:53,620
that's okay.
We'll,

2979
02:14:53,621 --> 02:14:55,840
we'll wrap this up but didn't know how I
feel about sweat.

2980
02:14:56,050 --> 02:14:58,030
Like I can't even wait to get the shirt 
off.

2981
02:14:58,090 --> 02:14:58,990
They don't sweat.

2982
02:14:59,830 --> 02:15:01,920
Well it depends.
I mean if it.

2983
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:04,650
Well I do like sweat but I don't like it
when I'm dressed.

2984
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:06,180
Okay.
All right.

2985
02:15:06,181 --> 02:15:10,160
You like make it sweat into 
congratulations on that with.

2986
02:15:10,660 --> 02:15:11,260
No,
I think.

2987
02:15:11,261 --> 02:15:14,080
I think you're very brave and I think 
what you're doing not just didn't.

2988
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:17,500
It's like what you're doing with your 
show,

2989
02:15:17,890 --> 02:15:22,890
but the way you're admitting your own 
personal demons and the battles that 

2990
02:15:23,411 --> 02:15:28,411
you're having with your own mind trying 
to sort of reformulate your view of the 

2991
02:15:29,051 --> 02:15:32,380
world and figure out who you are.
Thank you.

2992
02:15:32,381 --> 02:15:34,270
Know.
I think it's very important,

2993
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:35,740
very important for people to hear.

2994
02:15:35,830 --> 02:15:37,240
Thank you baby.
And honestly,

2995
02:15:37,241 --> 02:15:39,010
I really thank you for having me because
I,

2996
02:15:39,110 --> 02:15:44,110
it's,
it doesn't come without some 

2997
02:15:44,110 --> 02:15:44,530
repercussions to you,
I'm sure,

2998
02:15:44,950 --> 02:15:46,510
but I want you to know that I appreciate
it.

2999
02:15:46,630 --> 02:15:46,980
I really do

3000
02:15:47,010 --> 02:15:48,330
listen,
my pleasure.

3001
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:49,170
And,
uh,

3002
02:15:49,430 --> 02:15:49,970
let's,
uh,

3003
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:55,010
say hi again and not,
not over some wackiness like this after 

3004
02:15:55,010 --> 02:15:55,440
all these years.
It's been funny.

3005
02:15:55,441 --> 02:15:56,460
I haven't seen you in so long.

3006
02:15:57,340 --> 02:15:59,180
The seven minutes before we started 
this,

3007
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:01,150
we had a very funny color.

3008
02:16:01,390 --> 02:16:03,100
It was very funny.
No,

3009
02:16:03,101 --> 02:16:05,150
seriously.
What would you talk about another year?

3010
02:16:05,470 --> 02:16:07,150
What?
I for sure know.

3011
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:07,720
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

3012
02:16:07,721 --> 02:16:09,940
for sure.
But I think there's something there.

3013
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,740
I don't know if there's something funny 
about what we were talking about it.

3014
02:16:12,741 --> 02:16:14,460
Nobody's going to say what was it?
What was it?

3015
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:17,660
What was it about smells and things.
Oh,

3016
02:16:17,670 --> 02:16:19,610
it smells and things.
Periods.

3017
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:24,870
Goodnight everybody.
Leah Remini show when is not.

3018
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,350
Well,
it's done now.

3019
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:27,430
Yeah.
But what,

3020
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:28,330
uh,
oh,

3021
02:16:28,370 --> 02:16:30,730
I think you see it online and it went 
well.

3022
02:16:30,731 --> 02:16:33,520
It's on a and e all the time,
but on where they show it constantly.

3023
02:16:33,521 --> 02:16:35,050
It was on just a couple of nights ago.
I said,

3024
02:16:35,051 --> 02:16:36,380
I'm so glad.
Yeah,

3025
02:16:36,381 --> 02:16:37,630
they're,
they're hearing the shit out of it.

3026
02:16:37,631 --> 02:16:38,410
Yeah.
So,

3027
02:16:38,411 --> 02:16:39,400
um,
uh,

3028
02:16:39,401 --> 02:16:43,090
if people want to follow any of this,
is there a website they can go to?

3029
02:16:43,091 --> 02:16:44,700
I think they can go to eight.
Look,

3030
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:45,260
God,
I should've.

3031
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:47,110
They'll find it.
Google it.

3032
02:16:47,230 --> 02:16:47,920
Google it,
folks.

3033
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:49,480
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

3034
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:50,050
Bye everybody.
