1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:00,660
Yeah.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,030
All right.
We're live,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,170
sir.
First of all,

4
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:09,850
thank you very much for coming on and 
really appreciate it.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,500
I've enjoyed your youtube video.
I wouldn't say I've enjoyed I,

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,950
I haven't enjoyed them,
but I've been puzzled by them.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,540
Been puzzled by the subject and for 
people who have no idea what's going on.

8
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,630
Let's sort of unpack this for them.
In Canada,

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,390
Canada is very different than the United
States.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,320
I love Canada.
I'm a giant fan of Canada.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,670
There's one place I would live outside 
of the US.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,200
100 percent.
It would be Canada.

13
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:37,201
I love it up there.
I think the people are at least 20 

14
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,361
percent more polite than America,
but you've got some weird shit going on 

15
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,790
up there and your king.
What's the,

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,420
what do you call him?
Prime Minister Trudeau.

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,090
That fella to the Castro,
the Castro lover.

18
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:50,260
I was just going to say that this 
fucking guy and people have been posting

19
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:55,261
today all the atrocities that Castro 
committed during this regime to sort of 

20
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,900
show how proposed firing squad deaths.

21
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,940
Few thousand.
How about all the different people that 

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:02,940
they executed and then sold their blood 
to the Viet Cong.

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,200
That one,
this wonderful,

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,860
wonderful man.
He was a wonderful man that,

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,870
that fucking savage,
um,

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,910
Trudeau in what he represents is I think
the good side of it,

27
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:20,470
what he's trying to do,
the trying to make a kinder,

28
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:24,340
more progressive,
more inclusive country,

29
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,090
but along the way,
what they're doing is they're,

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,120
they're promoting what you would call 
online social justice warrior values and

31
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:38,641
some of them are a little preposterous.
You are one of the very few academics 

32
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,610
who have fought against some of these 
ideas that are not just being promoted 

33
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,790
but are being enforced and enforced and 
written into law.

34
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,120
And one of them is about gender 
pronouns.

35
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,770
Um,
w when would mean by gender pronouns is 

36
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,721
not just he and she,
but a whole slew of invented gender 

37
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:06,661
pronouns,
gender pronouns that you're going to be 

38
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:06,661
compelled to use.

39
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,830
Yeah.
You're already compelled to use.

40
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:11,890
And and likely in the states to,
even though people don't know it yet,

41
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:16,120
certainly in New York and the 
employment,

42
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,280
a EOC has already ruled on that with 
regards to businesses for theu ,

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,760
s and businesses.
And I believe also landlords,

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,420
I think.
Yeah.

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,160
So if your landlord chooses to ms dot 
gender you and not just mis-gender you,

46
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,640
like if you're a transgender woman,
you used to be mad.

47
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,670
Now you're a woman and they call you a 
he.

48
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:37,270
It's not just that like you're compelled
to use how many.

49
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:37,940
What is the,
what are those,

50
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,460
the number of them.
Now,

51
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,490
while there there's no standard 
nomenclature for the non gender or the 

52
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:44,980
further nonbinary types.
There's many,

53
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:49,981
many invented words.
And which of those you're supposed to 

54
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:53,341
use is dependent entirely on the 
subjective choice of the person that 

55
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:53,341
you're talking with.

56
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,540
Now,
most people I believe out there 

57
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:57,540
listening are going,
what the hell are they talking about?

58
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,071
Right now we're talking about as as 70 
plus invented gender pronouns,

59
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:08,551
like Zi x above zero h I r a bunch of 
weird ones and this is for people that 

60
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,080
don't necessarily think they're a.
He or a she,

61
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,420
so they prefer these things.
On top of that,

62
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,140
you have animal kin,
which other kids,

63
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,140
other kids himself,
which was the one I thought most abusing

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,860
worm self.
That's for the low self esteem.

65
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:34,861
Other kids.
This is people that truly believe that 

66
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:39,151
they are in the wrong body and that they
should have been born some form of 

67
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:43,600
animal and would like you to refer to 
them as this animal.

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,180
Your Elf or Elf or a fairy or a Pixie 
Pixie.

69
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:52,150
Ken.
I haven't seen Pixie kid.

70
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,890
That's a good one,
but just get on.

71
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,610
Tumbler got to get onto.
Yes,

72
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,250
absolutely.
That's where it all goes down.

73
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,850
I'm professor Peterson.
What the Hell's going on?

74
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,660
What is this?

75
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,210
Well,
I think it's partly.

76
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,000
It's partly a form of narcissism.
Yes,

77
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,780
it's.
It's a.

78
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,630
it's partly a consequence of,
of the re,

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,570
of the rise of the new rise again of of 
say Marxist doctrine.

80
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:21,571
I would say it's part of postmodernism.
Maybe it's postmodernism more than 

81
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,650
anything else because the postmodernists
that's a philosophical.

82
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,660
A community,
let's say,

83
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,110
believed that the entire point of human 
categorization is power and that 

84
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:36,741
dialogue between people is only a power 
dialogue and that there's no real 

85
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:42,841
reality outside of interpretation and 
that basically what we do is exchange 

86
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:46,720
interpretive viewpoints to ratchet up 
our dominance and status and that's that

87
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,780
and there's no biology as an ideology 
and the idea of the objective world is 

88
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,461
an ideology and sciences and ideology 
and it's all interpretation all the way 

89
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:57,280
down like turtles all the way down.

90
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,820
What?
What do you mean by it's all about 

91
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:02,820
power?
Like in what way?

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:02,890
Well,
imagine that,

93
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,120
that there are groups of people who are 
competing in the world for resources I 

94
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,501
suppose,
and that it's a zero sum game and it's 

95
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:17,480
every group against every other group 
and the reason that we engage in 

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,320
dialogue isn't to establish the truth or
move towards some,

97
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,350
some closer approximation of reality,
but to structure this social interaction

98
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:27,150
so that our group comes up on top.

99
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,320
Right?
And that it.

100
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,370
That is really what the problem is with 
all this is that it's not just a matter 

101
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,561
of choosing to be defined in one way,
but compelling others to define you in 

102
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:39,290
that way.

103
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,990
The most,
most awful elements of it I think is the

104
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:46,710
idea that individuals should be defined 
in terms of their group identity at all.

105
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,130
I mean you could argue,
and this is one of these weird 

106
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,240
inversions,
so characteristic of this chaotic state 

107
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,991
that we're in.
When people originally started fighting 

108
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,160
against unfair discrimination and and I 
say unfair

109
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
discrimination because lots of 
discrimination is fair.

110
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,610
If you discriminate against people on 
the basis of their competence,

111
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,910
that's perfectly reasonable.
It's unfair discrimination that that 

112
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,230
constitutes the proper battleground for 
people who have a more egalitarian 

113
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,771
viewpoint,
but the initial idea was to eliminate 

114
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,870
the proclivity for people to be 
categorized according to their group 

115
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,871
identity because that was interfering 
with everyone's ability to view them as 

116
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:29,710
as competent individuals.
But that got flipped probably in the 

117
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,940
seventies after the Soviet state.
So self evidently was revealed as a 

118
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:39,101
catastrophe.
That that got flipped so that the world 

119
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:42,491
was turned into one group against 
another power struggle from one group 

120
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:47,351
against another,
and then the social justice warrior 

121
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:49,871
types in the lefties,
even the Democratic Party started 

122
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:52,601
categorizing everybody according to 
their ethnic or sexual or racial 

123
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:56,111
identity and made that the canonical 
element of their being and that's an 

124
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:57,160
absolutely terrible thing to do it.

125
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,390
It leads to in the Soviet Union.
When that happened,

126
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:04,391
for example,
when they introduced that idea along 

127
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,990
with the notion of class guilt.
So for example,

128
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:10,991
when the Soviets collectivize the farms,
they pretty much wiped out or or raped 

129
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,430
and froze to death.
All of their.

130
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,120
All of their competent farmers,
they.

131
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,220
They called them Kulaks and they 
attributed class guilt to them because 

132
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,991
they were successful peasants and they 
define their success as oppression and 

133
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:27,620
theft.
They killed all of them,

134
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,680
pretty much ship them off to Siberia and
frozen to death and they were the 

135
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,280
productive agriculturalists in the 
Soviet Union.

136
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:36,710
And then in the 19 thirties in the 
Ukraine because of that,

137
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,750
about 6 million Ukrainian starved to 
death,

138
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,570
but the Soviets were big on collective 
guilt.

139
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,700
And all of these things that you hear 
about now,

140
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:48,020
like white privilege for example,
they're there are variants of collective

141
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:48,590
guilt.
I,

142
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,080
I,
I pick your bloody identity,

143
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:56,081
whatever it happens to be,
and then I make you a guilty member of 

144
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:59,591
that category and then you and the rest 
of the guilty members of that category 

145
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:00,020
are judged as a,
as a unit.

146
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,580
It's absolutely it's murderous,
pushed to its extreme,

147
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,170
and we've seen that many,
many times.

148
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,970
Yeah,
you're oppressed or your,

149
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:12,971
your,
your opinions rather a suppressed and 

150
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:15,671
you are automatically put into this 
category of people who should be 

151
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:16,850
dismissed because of the fact that you 
have white privilege.

152
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,250
You should step back and let others 
talk.

153
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,520
You should step back and this is a 
narrative that gets repeated over and 

154
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,530
over again in a social justice warrior 
culture.

155
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:29,531
This idea that you should just step back
and let these others talk because they 

156
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:29,531
understand as long.

157
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:34,510
Yeah.
And the others are always other group 

158
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:34,510
members,
right?

159
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,900
And somehow their,
their discourses to be privileged in 

160
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,190
reverse because hypothetically,
they're a member of an oppressed class.

161
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Of course,
then you can multiply the numbers of 

162
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:45,480
oppressed

163
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,390
classes ad Nauseum,
which is another part of the problem.

164
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,690
Yeah.
I like the idea is that in giving them 

165
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:51,690
privileged because they have been 
marginalized,

166
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,550
you will balance things out and you will
somehow another reverse the scale.

167
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,430
Yeah.
And that's another example

168
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,260
of the class based guilt idea.
You know,

169
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:03,261
it's um,
it doesn't seem to me self evident that 

170
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:04,440
I'm to blame for slavery for example.
I mean,

171
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:09,441
being a Canadian,
it's a slightly different situation I 

172
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:09,441
suppose,
but the,

173
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:11,190
the,
the idea that as the member,

174
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:16,191
as a member of a culture,
that you're somehow responsible for the 

175
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:17,710
past sins of that culture.
Let's say it,

176
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,200
it,
it's a very,

177
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:24,201
very anti western ethos.
It goes along with this idea of class 

178
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:25,920
guilt because your group membership is 
the most important thing.

179
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,550
If your group at some point in the past 
did something reprehensible,

180
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:32,130
which of course every group has done,
that's for sure.

181
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,090
Then you are de facto responsible in the
present for that.

182
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,540
How do you think we got to this point 
where people are repeating these 

183
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,790
patterns that were ultimately incredibly
unsuccessful and dangerous and deadly in

184
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,390
the past?

185
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:50,390
Like Marxism for example,
like people proudly proclaim themselves 

186
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,370
as having Marxist ideology,
one in five,

187
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,390
one in five social scientists claimed to
be a Marxist,

188
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,610
kind of understand the history.
Why don't you fill people in on how that

189
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,350
went bad?
Well,

190
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,830
the estimates vary,
but in the Soviet Union between 19,

191
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:09,831
19 in 1959,
somewhere between 30 and 50 million 

192
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:11,040
people were killed in internal 
oppression alone.

193
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,200
So that's pretty bad.
And then,

194
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,490
and,
and in China,

195
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,580
uh,
which was operating under exactly the 

196
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,160
same principles,
might have been up to 100 million killed

197
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,430
during Mao's time.
And of course my was still revered in 

198
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
China appallingly enough.
Um,

199
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,040
and Vietnam,
Vietnam and Cambodia and wherever these 

200
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,260
ideas were implemented,
Cuba,

201
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,340
wherever these ideas were implemented,
the result was absolute mayhem,

202
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,370
absolute mayhem.
And I think what happened is that the 

203
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,611
Marxist ideas are actually quite 
attractive if you're an intel 

204
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:43,611
electrical.

205
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:44,490
And if you're,
I would say,

206
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:47,640
if you're tilted towards compassion from
a personality perspective,

207
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,950
because they're based on doctrines like 
from,

208
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,340
from each,
according to his ability to each 

209
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,351
according to his need and the idea that 
you should fulfill people's needs or 

210
00:10:57,351 --> 00:10:58,440
that society should fulfill people's 
needs,

211
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,320
is on the surface of it,
and attractive idea.

212
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,620
Of course,
the problem is who gets to define the 

213
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,511
needs and who gets to define the 
abilities and that really is a big 

214
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:11,811
problem and well,
and then those ideas were put into 

215
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:16,320
practice a first in the Soviet Union.
And Alexander Solzhenitsyn who wrote the

216
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:20,970
Gulag archipelago,
did a very lovely job of detailing,

217
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,610
uh,
in,

218
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,620
in horrifying detail how those initial 
doctrines were transformed into 

219
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,171
legislation.
And then how those legislation was 

220
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:32,421
transformed into endless genocide 
essentially and almost destroyed the 

221
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:36,801
world.
Let's not forget that I'm partly with 

222
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:39,951
the W,
partly with the help of Castro who just 

223
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:39,951
died.

224
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:39,951
Um,
the,

225
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:41,250
the,
the doctrines when,

226
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,440
when put into practice in,
into,

227
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,830
into actual practice were,
were murdered us instantaneously.

228
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:51,831
Now what happened,
they're always apologists for the left 

229
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:52,560
in the West,
especially in France,

230
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,220
especially among the French 
intellectuals,

231
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:57,550
especially in the late 19 sixties and 
then when,

232
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,060
when all of the information about what 
was happening is in the Soviet Union 

233
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,200
came flooding forward and that 
culminated say in 19,

234
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,460
19,
73 wouldn't.

235
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Soldier Netter's book was published.
The French intellectuals changed their 

236
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,880
tune instead of agitating on a part of 
the working class,

237
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:16,220
which was which allied them with a 
murderous marxists.

238
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:21,220
They switched and started talking about 
power and to talk about group identity.

239
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,280
It was like a sleight of hand.
The underlying pathological philosophy 

240
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,350
remained exactly the same,
but the surface nomenclature changed and

241
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,380
that became very attractive and it at 
the same time the Soviet Union 

242
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,501
dissolved.
And so one of the problems I think we 

243
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:39,721
have now a perverse problem is that 
these Marxist ideas are very attractive 

244
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:42,310
to compassionate intellectuals and we 
don't have good,

245
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,710
bad examples like the Soviet Union 
around that.

246
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,090
Everybody can point to and go,
yeah,

247
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:47,170
yeah,
well that sounds good,

248
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:52,171
but you know,
what about the murderous death camps in 

249
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:52,171
the millions of people who are 
suffering.

250
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,500
We still have North Korea,
but you know,

251
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:57,160
people treat North Korea like it's a 
joke instead of like it's an exemplar of

252
00:12:57,161 --> 00:13:02,161
a pathological system and,
and people have no historical memory 

253
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:06,181
like my students and that's partly 
because they're taught so badly in 

254
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,870
schools is they have no idea what 
happened in the Soviet Union.

255
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,220
They have absolutely no idea.
They know a little bit about the Second 

256
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,190
World War maybe and of course people 
generally know about the Holocaust,

257
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,190
but they have no idea what happened in 
the Soviet Union.

258
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,290
So they have no idea where these ideas 
could lead.

259
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,210
And,
and the,

260
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,430
and the universities and the high 
schools are so full of people who are 

261
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,030
radically left leaning that they're 
never taught any,

262
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:29,980
that students are never taught any 
proper history.

263
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:35,010
You know,
they're taught about the evils of 

264
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,010
capitalism and you know,
I mean it's not like.

265
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,960
It's not like any system is perfect,
but there's difference between imperfect

266
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:45,811
and and consciously murderous.
I think one of the things that you've 

267
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:50,241
just said that's very important is that 
it's attractive to compassionate 

268
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:54,421
intellectuals.
People that without really looking at 

269
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:58,981
what the potential for these,
the these laws and regulations with the 

270
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:04,591
negative potential for them is that the,
the underlying inclination to lean 

271
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,560
towards that is that you,
you,

272
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,680
you care about people and then you,
you want people to be okay and yeah,

273
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,590
when you're kind of treating them like 
they're your children's and,

274
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,330
and I don't mean that in an entirely 
sarcastic manner.

275
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,090
It's reasonable in some sense to treat 
other people like people that you love.

276
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,790
Although it's not reasonable and in very
many other ways,

277
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:32,791
which is why you don't invite every 
stranger on the street to come and live 

278
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:32,791
with you in your house.

279
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,480
I mean everybody puts up boundaries and 
you have to do that,

280
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,050
but.
And people tend more than than we ever 

281
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,101
expected.
And I've done a lot of research in my 

282
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:46,330
lab that people do tend to vote and 
think their temperament a lot more than,

283
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,660
than anyone really realizes.
And,

284
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
and if you're kind and that's your 
highest virtue,

285
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,190
then you tend to treat people like 
they're kin because that's what kind 

286
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,190
means,
right?

287
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,151
It said an extension of the word kin,
but that doesn't work well in larger 

288
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:05,021
groups.
You need other principals and so you 

289
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:05,021
look at something like the idea of of 
equity,

290
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:08,090
which is equality of outcome rather than
equality of opportunity.

291
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,640
On the surface of it,
it seems perfectly reasonable to say,

292
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:15,641
well,
if every resource isn't distributed 

293
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:18,400
absolutely equally to every group,
then the system is unfair and on the 

294
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:20,630
face of it,
that's a reasonable proposition,

295
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:23,270
but it falls apart under minimal 
examination.

296
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,580
So here's something to think about for,
for all,

297
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,670
for everyone who thinks that equality of
outcome is a good idea,

298
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:31,370
it's like why the hell are you striving 
for anything?

299
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:36,371
Then?
Because the reason anyone strives to 

300
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:40,901
better themselves or to develop a skill 
or to move forward in life at all is to 

301
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,180
produce inequality.
You're trying to rise above the mediocre

302
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:49,070
masses every time you make an effort at 
anything.

303
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,460
And so everything that we associate a 
positive movement forward to a positive 

304
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:59,660
motivation is actually an attempt to 
render the world more on equal.

305
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,930
Now you're rendering and on we equal in 
adjust way,

306
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,730
right?
Because we might say,

307
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:05,870
well,
if you work really hard,

308
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:08,570
you deserve and unequal outcome.
Well yeah,

309
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,090
unless you want people to stop working 
hard.

310
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,340
And that was the old joke in the Soviet 
Union,

311
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,770
you know,
they pretend to pay us,

312
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,780
we pretend to work.

313
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,720
So it's.
So it's,

314
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:24,010
it's,
it's so thoughtless that that's,

315
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,880
that's the problem.
That is a big problem.

316
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,700
The phrase income inequality,
do you never hear effort inequality?

317
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,290
Because the effort,

318
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,590
oh well,
you know,

319
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:33,980
in,
in,

320
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:36,710
in some on some campuses,
and this is true in California,

321
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,740
it's now considered a,
a form of aggression.

322
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,360
It's classified under the 
microaggression to say that hard work is

323
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:49,361
the one,
one of the reasons that people 

324
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:49,930
accumulate more,
accumulate more,

325
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:51,970
accumulate more value,
accumulate more property,

326
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,590
accumulate more money.
It's,

327
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:54,850
it's,
it's an aggression.

328
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,880
It's aggressive to say that because it 
implies that people who who are poor 

329
00:16:59,880 --> 00:16:59,880
don't work hard.
Now,

330
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,920
see,
that's another terribly fuzzy form of 

331
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,340
thinking because there are lots of 
reasons for people to not have money,

332
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,130
many to be poor,
let's say,

333
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,160
which is even,
which is even different than not having 

334
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,160
money,
alcoholism,

335
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,760
drug addiction,
mental illness,

336
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,060
physical illness,
intellectual incapacity and lack of 

337
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,420
work,
all of those things,

338
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,800
so environmental factors.
What communities grow up into,

339
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,740
what you're being exposed to.
People imitate their atmosphere.

340
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:33,741
You're around people that are constantly
in trouble with the law and you're 

341
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:37,161
dealing with horrible environments.
There's a lot of factors and I think 

342
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:39,780
that one of the things that's really 
important about having these discussions

343
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,990
is that they,
they break down these rigid ideologies 

344
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,560
that a lot of these kids that are going 
to these universities are sort of being 

345
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,460
shoved into their shoved into these 
ideology.

346
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,470
You're either on the left or you're on 
the right and there's very few on the 

347
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,401
right.
There's no open market of ideas when it 

348
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:02,721
comes to discussing these things.
You're compelled and enforced into 

349
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:06,270
surgeon.
He's a psychologist at the New York,

350
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,800
New York University business school.
He's done a really good job

351
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,500
documenting the dearth of ideological 
viewpoints,

352
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:18,501
let's say political or temperamental 
viewpoints because that's more accurate 

353
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:22,120
in the modern university and its 
appalling because with along with all 

354
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,180
this push for ethnic and sexual and 
racial diversity,

355
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,100
which I think is just a mask to enforce 
a kind of ideological homogeneity,

356
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:34,101
there's no even understanding that 
ideational diversity is the only 

357
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:40,251
relevant value for for a university.
The rest of it's all predicated on the 

358
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:46,911
assumption that if you do select people 
because of their ethnicity or racial 

359
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,351
background or gender,
that that will in and of itself produce 

360
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:55,220
diversity of ideas,
which is another really pernicious idea 

361
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,270
because it assumes that and it's so 
contradictory.

362
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,750
The left describes anything that's 
associated with the assumption that 

363
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:07,020
someone who's female for example,
will think in a female way.

364
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,480
They regard that as an unreasonable 
prejudice.

365
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,750
You have to perfectly reasonable to say 
that we need more women in x discipline 

366
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,910
because they will bring in female ideas.

367
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,390
It's like,
well,

368
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,210
what?
What?

369
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,210
What?
What the hell are female ideas?

370
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,650
You can't have it both ways unless 
you're completely in,

371
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:31,010
unless you don't care at all about 
coherence or consistency and ideologues 

372
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,750
really don't because they care about 
putting their ideology fourth,

373
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,260
but the idea that you're going to get a 
diversity of ideas because you have a 

374
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,141
diversity of of class of people,
assumes that ideas and identity are the 

375
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:47,310
same thing and that's an absurd 
proposition.

376
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,300
In fact,
that's that's.

377
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,800
That's an essentially racial racist 
proposition.

378
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,170
Black people think differently than 
white people.

379
00:19:55,171 --> 00:20:00,171
It's no some do and some don't,
and the overlap is substantive than the 

380
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:04,581
difference between the individuals is 
far greater than the difference between 

381
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:04,581
the group.

382
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:07,590
I think we also need to make a very 
clear distinction between discrimination

383
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:12,591
and people that are just inclined to 
gravitate towards different careers and 

384
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:15,851
different focuses.
There is a big difference between women 

385
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:19,191
being forced out of tech and women being
not as compelled to enter into tech 

386
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,840
careers as men,
but we're well that,

387
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:22,250
that,
that,

388
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,250
that tech,
the tech issue is a really interesting 

389
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:27,670
one for a couple of reasons.
One is that of course,

390
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:32,440
high tech basically developed after the 
playing field for men and women was more

391
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,870
or less level,
I mean that happened in the 19 seventies

392
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,820
and despite that there weren't any near 
anywhere near as many women in tech.

393
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,900
There's far more women in caring 
professions and you see that 

394
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,820
particularly in Scandinavia where 
they've done everything they can to 

395
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,611
equal to equalize the playing.
It's 20 to one female to male nurses and

396
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:53,080
20 to one male to female engineers.

397
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:58,310
Matt,
if you could the Scandinavian issue 

398
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,310
because it's very interesting.

399
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,190
Yeah,
that's done over there and what the 

400
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,190
results of them.
Yeah.

401
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,160
Well imagine that.
There are two reasons that people differ

402
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,060
there.
There are more than two,

403
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,100
but just imagine for the time being that
there are two.

404
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:08,500
One is for environmental reasons,
cultural reasons,

405
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:13,501
and the other is for biological reasons.
What happens if you flatten out the 

406
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:18,061
environmental reasons,
which is what's happened in Scandinavia 

407
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:18,670
is you maximize the biological 
differences.

408
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,770
You don't get rid of them,
you maximize them.

409
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:25,771
And so what's happened in Scandinavia is
that men and women are more different 

410
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:26,230
from a temperament,
personality perspective,

411
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:31,231
and also in terms of their interests.
They're more different in scandinavia 

412
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:31,630
than they are anywhere else in the 
world.

413
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:37,030
Now,
what have they done to try to flatten 

414
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,030
things out?
As you say?

415
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,050
Well,
they've transformed their social policy 

416
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,270
so that men and women have as close to 
equal opportunity say,

417
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:45,271
as any society has managed,
but that hasn't produced the hope for 

418
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:45,730
equality of outcome.

419
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,830
Quite quite the contrary in many 
situations.

420
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:49,980
It's exaggerated it and you could say 
that,

421
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,170
that that's actually okay.
Is that what you want?

422
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,440
What you want is to have a society where
the genuine differences between people 

423
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,730
are free to manifest themselves.
So for example,

424
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:02,680
if you,
if you have three or four kids,

425
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,160
say the kids are going to be a different
from one another genetically,

426
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,590
that's why they're not identical twins.
They differ genetically and if you set 

427
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,800
the environment up so that each child is
supportive,

428
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,840
that children actually turned out quite 
differently.

429
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,000
Now,
if you're an absolute brute and you beat

430
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:24,001
them and you abused them,
then they'll all turn out the same 

431
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:24,001
because there's tremendous environmental
influence on them then,

432
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,160
but if you,
if you form an individual relationship 

433
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,640
with each of them and allow their 
strengths to manifest themselves as they

434
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,600
will in,
in a,

435
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:36,601
in a supportive environment,
and the kids are going to turn out very 

436
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:39,331
different and so a free society is 
actually one that that produces 

437
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:43,561
massively unequal outcomes because it 
allows the genuine differences between 

438
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:43,750
people to manifest themselves.

439
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,100
These people who are pushing equity at,
which is equality of outcome.

440
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,560
That's what the word equity codes for.
By the way,

441
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:52,960
equality of outcome and not equality of 
opportunity.

442
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,830
I don't know what in the world they do 
with regards to the fact that a very 

443
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,830
large number of professions are high 
quality,

444
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,840
high,
high paid professions are female 

445
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:05,840
dominated physicians,
for example,

446
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,530
psychologists,
um,

447
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,640
any,
any of the disciplines that have to do 

448
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:11,640
with human care almost inevitably 
dominated by women.

449
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,110
And that's increasingly the case is that
we're supposed to stop that.

450
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Is that also a sign of oppression?
We're going to force women to do things 

451
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,140
they're not interested in.

452
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Well,
there's also a very disingenuous way of 

453
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,400
framing it here in America where people 
consistently,

454
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,511
even the president of United States,
Obama was talking about income 

455
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:29,710
inequality and the way they frame income
inequality.

456
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,820
They talk about the seventy nine cents 
to the dollar,

457
00:23:31,821 --> 00:23:36,821
but what they don't discuss that we're 
talking about completely different 

458
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:36,821
careers.
We're not.

459
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:41,050
The way they frame it,
they frame it as if two people are 

460
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,050
working side by side.
One is a man,

461
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,870
one is a woman.
They're both doing the same job.

462
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:43,790
The man makes a dollar.
The woman who makes seventy nine cents,

463
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,670
that is not the case.
It's typical of ideological

464
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,190
conversation because what happens 
technically,

465
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:54,191
like imagine that a given.
We talked about poverty a few minutes 

466
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:54,191
ago and you said,
well,

467
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:54,470
there's,
there's many,

468
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:57,530
many reasons that one person might have 
more money than another.

469
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,800
Um,
there are many,

470
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:05,300
many reasons why women might make less 
money on average than men.

471
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,340
There.
There are small businesses that women 

472
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,340
run,
for example,

473
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,540
make far less money than men's,
the small businesses that men run.

474
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,750
But that's partly because a lot of women
run their businesses part time because 

475
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,991
they have kids.
It's also partly because men do all the 

476
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:20,120
horrible,
dangerous jobs,

477
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,340
the ones where there's a high chance of 
dying,

478
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,410
men are much more likely to work 
outside.

479
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,620
Um,
men are much more likely to move in,

480
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,100
in pursuit of a career opportunity.
There are lots of reasons that,

481
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,560
that men and women differ in terms of 
their income.

482
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:35,930
But if you're an idiot log,
you can only handle one variable.

483
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Oh,
men and women measured on mass don't 

484
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,840
have the same incomes.
Therefore the system is corrupt.

485
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,110
Jesus,
how much thinking does it take to come 

486
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,960
up with a,
with a theoretical scenario like that?

487
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,070
So boneheaded and it just runs,
it just pushes the ideological,

488
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,330
uh,
it just pushes the ideology forward with

489
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:56,960
no thought.

490
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,290
Now,
as a professor,

491
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,410
why is this sort of objective reasoning 
and really absolutely honest assessment 

492
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:09,630
of this situation?
Why is it so rare amongst professors?

493
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,400
Why is it so rare in universities?
Why is this such an unusual subject?

494
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,880
Well,
I think the reason is is that when,

495
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,900
when people first encounter a complex 
topic like income differences,

496
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,280
it's like imagine you were drawing a map
of the territory and you don't know the 

497
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,041
territory very well.
The first thing you do is just roughly 

498
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,300
sketch out the shapes of the continence 
and maybe you're wrong.

499
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,760
Like the early European maps of North 
America,

500
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,530
you know,
you kind of get one coastline,

501
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,380
right?
Guests and the rest it's blurry and gray

502
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,200
and then as you investigate more and 
more,

503
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:51,201
your picture of the situation becomes 
higher and higher and higher and higher 

504
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:55,080
resolution.
It's hard to go from a low resolution 

505
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,401
representation to a high resolution.
Representation and ideologies are low 

506
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:02,481
resolution representations.
So the thing about a low resolution 

507
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:04,380
representations is it looks like it 
covers everything,

508
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,110
but it doesn't.
The closer you look,

509
00:26:07,111 --> 00:26:08,730
the more details there are.
You know,

510
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:10,620
if you get a three year old to draw a 
helicopter,

511
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:15,621
they put like a little cross on the top 
and a circle in a stick and another 

512
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:16,170
circle.
And that's the helicopter.

513
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,100
Well,
you know,

514
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:18,690
when you look at it,
that's a helicopter,

515
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,330
but no one would expect that thing to 
fly.

516
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,270
If you want to change that into a real 
model of a helicopter,

517
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:28,140
you have to increase your focus and 
concentration on every single element of

518
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:32,760
the entity and that takes a tremendous 
amount of cognitive effort and sometimes

519
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:34,920
you don't even know what you don't know 
about something.

520
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,900
You know?
I could say,

521
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:39,900
well,
there are 50 reasons why men and women's

522
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,610
income differ.
Well,

523
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:44,220
that doesn't mean I can all

524
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,570
50 of those differences in each of those
50 differences are fragmented into maybe

525
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,870
another dozen categories each.
Maybe there's 600 reasons why men and 

526
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,711
women's salary differ,
but you have to spend a tremendous 

527
00:26:57,711 --> 00:27:01,911
amount of time paying attention and 
thinking to build your model of reality 

528
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:06,351
into that level of resolution.
And basically what you do is default to 

529
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:09,000
temperamentally,
I'm influenced ideologies.

530
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,160
They give you a one bit answer to 
everything.

531
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,460
Why are men and women?
Why do men and women's salaries 

532
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,420
different oppression?
It's always the same thing and it makes.

533
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:23,430
It makes you feel like you know 
something and people like that because 

534
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,590
they don't like the I the feeling that 
there's something they don't know,

535
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:28,170
they don't like to be in chaos.
That's basically chaos.

536
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:32,520
They like to be an order.
An order is where you know everything so

537
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,880
and professors are no different,
no different than than than people 

538
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,600
obviously.
Given that there are people,

539
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,790
maybe they're more intelligent on 
average.

540
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,570
They're also more sheltered,
I would say in many ways on average and 

541
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,080
they're also not challenged as often 
tenure,

542
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,540
10 years in issue and also not competing
in the marketplace,

543
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,810
not being in the workforce,
going from being in high school to being

544
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:02,140
in universities,
to getting a degree to teaching,

545
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,240
to being a professor,
to getting tenured,

546
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,400
staying inside of that intellectual 
bubble.

547
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,970
Yeah.
Well it's complicated.

548
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:09,890
Often these things,
these things happen.

549
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:11,720
They're like positive feedback loops.
You know,

550
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,910
when you bring a speaker too close to 
her microphone,

551
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:18,911
too close to a speaker and it starts to 
howl and I think something like that's 

552
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:20,900
happened in the universities is that 
they started to tilt towards the left in

553
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:25,901
the sixties and then as they tilted they
tilted harder and as they tilled it 

554
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:30,190
harder,
they tilt it even harder until all of 

555
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,180
the diversity was forced out of the 
universities and I don't know if it's so

556
00:28:32,181 --> 00:28:35,060
much a consequence of the actual 
policies of the university as,

557
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,120
as just a feedback process that got out 
of control.

558
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,780
I mean if it's 50 percent liberals and 
50 percent conservatives,

559
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:42,860
no,
no problem.

560
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,610
But if it's 70 percent liberals and 30 
percent conservatives,

561
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:51,170
maybe it rapidly goes to 99 percent 
liberals and one percent conservatives.

562
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,580
Is that what it's like right now?
I mean,

563
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:55,130
what is it when you look at the 
University of Toronto,

564
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,900
where you are,
what,

565
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,720
what is the number?
If you had to guess?

566
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Well,
it would depend to some degree on the 

567
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:04,880
discipline,
but,

568
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,290
but,
but professors are also also tend to be 

569
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,760
characterized by personality traits that
do tilt them towards liberalism.

570
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:13,480
They're higher in trait openness,
which is both creativity and interest in

571
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:18,481
ideas.
That's one of the things that 

572
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:18,481
temperamentally distinguishes liberals 
from conservatives.

573
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:22,860
Conservatives are more conscientious,
they're more orderly and industrious 

574
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,950
liberals are more open,
so they're more interested in aesthetics

575
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:28,951
and ideas and of course being interested
in this statics and ideas does tilt you 

576
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:30,240
towards an academic career.
Um,

577
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,270
it's hard to tell.
I mean it certainly the bulk of the bulk

578
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:38,780
of intellectuals are,
are liberal and liberal,

579
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:41,710
left virtually all of them I would say.

580
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,140
And then that's probably not,
that's not as true.

581
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:46,210
We know this is not as true in the hard 
sciences,

582
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,520
but in the social sciences and the 
humanities,

583
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:51,430
it's the overwhelming majority.
I mean,

584
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:56,431
I could see that even in this,
in this battle that I've been in Canada 

585
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:59,671
with regards to bill [inaudible] in 
these compelled pronouns that almost no 

586
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:01,330
support from my faculty colleagues now.
I didn't expect any.

587
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:02,980
I mean,
and I'm not shocked by that,

588
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,370
but,
but it's an indication that if you put 

589
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,610
to them a choice between social justice 
slash all consuming compassion and 

590
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:16,240
freedom of expression,
they're going to tilt hard towards the,

591
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,820
the social justice compassion end of 
things.

592
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,580
It almost seemed like when I was 
watching some of the debates that you've

593
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:26,581
engaged in,
it almost seems like they're 

594
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:26,581
politicians.
Some seems like they,

595
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:27,010
their wedding,
their finger and going with the breeze.

596
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,290
There's some conversations that you had 
that were just.

597
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,010
I had to stop and rewind them because I 
couldn't believe the arguments.

598
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,110
There was a woman,
I don't know it was.

599
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:42,490
Was it a transgender man that you were 
having a discussion with that was saying

600
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:46,050
that there's no difference?
No biological difference in the sexist,

601
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,180
new biological difference.
He said that the scientific consensus 

602
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,180
for the last court date,
I'm not sure.

603
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,450
I'm not.
I don't believe so.

604
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:57,451
He,
he was a professor who taught 

605
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:57,451
transgender studies at the University of
Toronto and yeah,

606
00:30:57,451 --> 00:31:02,191
and he said outright that there were no 
biological differences between men and 

607
00:31:02,191 --> 00:31:03,160
women and that that was the scientific 
consensus.

608
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,340
And he and he believed that he had the 
qualifications to say that because he 

609
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,190
was a historian of medicine,
which,

610
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:14,670
which hardly qualifies as scientists,
not that you have to be a scientist to 

611
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,200
notice that there are biological 
differences between men and women.

612
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,410
It was very bizarre for me at that at 
that point in this in the last few 

613
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,160
months because I was under substantial 
pressure from the university to stop 

614
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,211
repeating my claim,
that I wouldn't use compelled pronouns 

615
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:34,830
to refer to people because the 
university regarded that is against the 

616
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,400
university policies and also against the
Ontario Human Rights Code.

617
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,330
So also illegal and as my employers,
they're responsible for everything.

618
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,060
I say whether or not there has been a 
complaint made,

619
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,240
whether or not the consequence of my 
speeches intended or unintended because 

620
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,210
that's built into the legislation and 
believe me,

621
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:52,630
that's coming your way because this 
legislation spreads like mad,

622
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,900
but on the one hand I was.
I got two letters of warning from the 

623
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,580
university for refusing to use these 
compelled pronouns,

624
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:05,581
which I regard as the ideological 
constructions of radical left wingers 

625
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:09,960
and this professor went on the agenda.
This is Ontario new show and announced 

626
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,910
publicly that there are no biological 
differences between men and women.

627
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:13,810
It was like,
Huh.

628
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:19,290
You think maybe the university would 
have had something to say about that 

629
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:19,290
since they do in fact have a biology 
department,

630
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,500
but.
Oh No.

631
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,160
That,
that,

632
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,770
that went by without notice.
That was perfectly fine.

633
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:29,060
Is saying it's such an insane thing to 
say if there's no biological difference 

634
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,770
than why they taking hormones.
Well,

635
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:34,771
that's a good question.
Why bother with the surgery and the 

636
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:34,771
horror?
Especially the hormones.

637
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:38,701
Yeah,
because that's not like you could argue 

638
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:38,701
with surgery that that's cosmetic,
right?

639
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:40,220
This person,
whoever this professor

640
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,250
was as a expert in transgender studies,
Nicholas,

641
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,430
Matt,
um,

642
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,950
I'm pretty sure that used to be a woman 
or she,

643
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:54,040
they.
You're not allowed to say that if you 

644
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,321
say that you're a bad person,
if you say they and they in them is the 

645
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:59,790
most reasonable of these,
a pronoun,

646
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,700
these alternative pronouns,
they and them,

647
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,970
like you could say,
if you know a guy and he does know how 

648
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,481
to swim,
they should probably stay out of the 

649
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:10,481
pool.
Right?

650
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:10,610
Right.
You can say that you could use that in a

651
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:12,470
non polar will form.
Yes,

652
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:16,010
and they is used to repair awkward 
sentences basically,

653
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:21,011
but it's never been used despite the 
claims of the of the gender bender 

654
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:24,641
activists.
It's never been used for the singular 

655
00:33:24,641 --> 00:33:24,641
and we shouldn't.
We shouldn't,

656
00:33:24,641 --> 00:33:25,040
we shouldn't,
we shouldn't.

657
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,680
All just language.
We don't give up the distinction between

658
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:28,850
the plural news segment or now.

659
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,020
It's certainly need to know whether it's
one person or more than one person.

660
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Do you think it's reasonable for people 
that are asexual people that really are 

661
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,830
uncomfortable with the idea of being a 
man or a woman?

662
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,740
Is it reasonable that we come up with a 
distinction for that?

663
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,980
I mean that seems like it would be nice 
and this is one of the things that 

664
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:47,980
you've said,
one of the,

665
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,620
one of the things that you don't like 
about this,

666
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:53,621
that you're being compelled to use these
made up pronouns and that if we as a 

667
00:33:53,621 --> 00:33:54,680
society,
as a culture,

668
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:59,681
as a civilization,
sort of adopt a new phrase that you 

669
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:02,360
would.
That one we had transexual were.

670
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:03,770
Yeah,
but I know.

671
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:07,160
I know that's problematic because it's 
not asexual.

672
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,370
Transexual would be transitioned and 
here's the other distinction.

673
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:15,371
This is another important thing.
Those aren't the people that have the 

674
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:15,371
problem with it.

675
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:16,160
The people that have the problem with 
these pronouns,

676
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,920
the transsexual community almost 
entirely,

677
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:24,100
or at least I shouldn't say entirely,
but predominantly prefer the alternative

678
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,450
pronoun.
A male to female transgender person 

679
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,110
prefers to be called a woman or she and 
use the female pronouns and male 

680
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,110
opponents.
Yes.

681
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,601
Yeah,
so there's some tinies abolition of the 

682
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:40,690
Trans Sexual Community,
or we could say there's some tiny 

683
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,371
fraction of people who are identifying 
themselves with the transgender 

684
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,970
community,
which is already a tiny fraction.

685
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,210
Who claims that they have an identity 
that doesn't fit into either binary 

686
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,040
category.
Well,

687
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:55,180
it's a proposition that I think bears 
some scrutiny to begin with because I 

688
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,640
don't believe that the claims that that 
tiny community is making our coherent in

689
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:00,380
any sense because they say,
well,

690
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:02,900
you could be man woman or neither or 
both.

691
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,140
It's,
it's,

692
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,190
it's those aren't coherent claims in my 
estimation,

693
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:12,191
and if what they're saying is,
if we don't fit into a category and 

694
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:16,820
therefore we get to invent our own 
plurality of categories,

695
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,720
it's not logically tenable that isn't 
how it works because you get an infinite

696
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:25,721
number of categories out of that.
And that's what's happening already 

697
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:27,230
online.
One of my favorite stories came out of,

698
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,160
uh,
an all girls university in Massachusetts

699
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,220
where a group of women where they were 
trying to pick a president of the 

700
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:37,860
student body or whatever.

701
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,760
And uh,
one of the girls who went to that school

702
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:47,030
decided that she identified as a man.
So she changed her name and I don't 

703
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:50,280
believe there was any hormones or 
anything involved.

704
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,550
I think she just changed her name.
She called herself masculine of center,

705
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,910
Gender Queer,
changed your name to a masculine name,

706
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,450
ran for president of whatever the hell 
this is.

707
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,950
I think it was willingly.
Yes,

708
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:06,951
I believe you're right.
One and then was denounced by the rest 

709
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:09,720
of the class because now she was a white
male.

710
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:13,920
So she was a part of the patriarchy and 
she was a part of the whole problem with

711
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:18,921
society and that she should not be 
allowed or he should not be allowed to 

712
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:19,470
take that position,
which I just,

713
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,240
I.
that's a really good example.

714
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,040
We read it on air and I couldn't stop 
laughing.

715
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:23,560
Right.
Well that's good.

716
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,450
That's a really good example of the 
chaos that ensues when you start to blow

717
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:32,451
apart standard categories.
There's a chaos in between categories 

718
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:34,560
that that's made of a,
of an infinite multiplicity.

719
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:38,070
That's why you see two with the lgbt 
rainbow.

720
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,280
They're getting caught in their own 
metaphor.

721
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,520
So there's an infinite number of 
gradations in a rainbow and there's an 

722
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,821
infinite number of letters that are 
accumulating on the lgbt rainbow and 

723
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,310
there's an element of clear absurdity to
that.

724
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:58,311
And one of them is,
I believe it's q plus that includes the 

725
00:36:58,311 --> 00:36:58,950
other kin types.
It's like,

726
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,450
well,
the claim is,

727
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,770
well,
I'm marginalized,

728
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,840
and then that sort of becomes 
normalized.

729
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:06,000
And then there's a group right outside 
of that that says,

730
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:07,410
well,
I'm marginalized to.

731
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:08,400
And another group says,
well,

732
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:09,450
I'm,
here I am.

733
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,070
I'm also marginalized and there's 
absolutely no logic.

734
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,910
Once you've identified yourself as 
marginalized,

735
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,180
there's no logical way that you can 
exclude anyone else who regard 

736
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,900
themselves as marginalized and so the 
marginalized,

737
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:25,550
the,
the,

738
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,600
the community of the marginalized 
expands and expands and expands and 

739
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:30,600
expands.

740
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,390
And part of the reason for that is that 
people are,

741
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:38,570
every individual is a multiplicity and 
there's an element to every individual 

742
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,340
that's marginalized,
you know,

743
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:46,341
so for example,
it's clearly the case that when a child 

744
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:49,590
is socialized,
there's pros and cons to that.

745
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,070
The pros are the socialization turns the
little beastly two year old into a four 

746
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:59,871
year old that other children can play 
with and that that does happen between 

747
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:00,990
the ages of two and four.
If a child is socialized properly,

748
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,280
then then what the child does is kind of
turned into a clone of everyone else so 

749
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:10,620
that he or she can benefit from being 
able to interact with everyone else.

750
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,680
Now that that builds up a certain amount
of individuality because kids learn to 

751
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,920
talk and they learned to play and all 
that,

752
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,380
and it destroys a certain amount of 
individuality.

753
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,910
So everybody sacrifices a certain 
portion of their peculiarity to become a

754
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:28,911
socialized creature and some of that's 
good and some of it's bad and we know 

755
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:28,911
that that's.

756
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:33,410
That's the standard story of the 
rebellious Adolescent Against Society 

757
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,380
for crushing their individuality.
Right?

758
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,970
And there's,
there's some,

759
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:41,070
there's an element of that that's true,
but by the same token,

760
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,530
if you don't sacrifice a certain amount 
of your individuality to the group,

761
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,990
there's no such thing as society.
Everybody has to live on their own.

762
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,970
Everyone is in their own subjective 
bubble,

763
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:59,971
which is of course now required by this 
law and society itself breaks down and 

764
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:04,921
so you can't have a society without 
marginalizing people or you can't have a

765
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:09,400
society without making everyone part of 
everyone marginalized.

766
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:11,830
And so then when you start to 
concentrate on the marginalized,

767
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,130
it just grows and expands and grows and 
expands and grows and expand until 

768
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,761
everyone becomes marginalized.
And that just highlights a real problem 

769
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:25,561
with quote mining that is going to take 
that you can't have a society without 

770
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:28,570
marginalizing people quote and put it 
under Dr Jordan Peterson.

771
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,430
This is what he believes.
Well,

772
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:33,050
that's actually what Jacques Derrida's 
said that the,

773
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:33,500
the,
the,

774
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,460
the most famous of the postmodernists,
that,

775
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,590
that's why derrick is such a,
uh,

776
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,050
invasive force.
He said,

777
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:46,051
well,
you can't have a society without 

778
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:46,051
marginalizing.
It's like,

779
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:46,051
well,
that's true.

780
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,050
It's true comma,
but dot,

781
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,680
dot,
dot.

782
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,710
Right.
But the fact that you can't have a 

783
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,160
society without marginalizing doesn't 
mean that you shouldn't have a society.

784
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:59,080
And it doesn't mean that the only reason
that society exists is to marginalize.

785
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,170
And that was at his claim that that's 
what makes him so he's absolutely 

786
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,890
pathological to the core.
Jacques Derrida,

787
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,660
and,
and apart from his claims that all we do

788
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,360
is trade power games because that's 
another one of his claims.

789
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,690
His other claim is that the purpose of 
categorization,

790
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:19,420
the purchase purpose of society is to 
marginalize.

791
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:23,860
And that's absolutely absurd.
The purpose is so that we can all play a

792
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:29,440
moderately mediocre but productive,
homogenous social game.

793
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,210
Is it perfect?
Well,

794
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:36,211
obviously not.
Does it require the sacrifice of 

795
00:40:36,211 --> 00:40:36,370
individuality?
Yes.

796
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,640
Is some of that sacrificed individuality
valuable?

797
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,910
Absolutely.
What's the alternative?

798
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,510
No society.
While I don't think so,

799
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,840
that doesn't seem like a very good 
alternative to me or maybe some sort of 

800
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,980
egalitarian utopia.
Well yeah,

801
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:58,981
we had 100 years of that and 100 million
deaths as a consequence and so maybe not

802
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:04,411
that either.
What we have right now is a flawed 

803
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:07,231
system,
but it's the best flawed system that 

804
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,710
anybody's ever come up with and of 
course it marginalizes people.

805
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,930
How could it not?
You know,

806
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,950
if,
if kids organize themselves in a 

807
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,761
playground to play hide and go seek,
they've marginalized all the kids that 

808
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:21,661
wanted to play tag obviously,
but that doesn't mean that they 

809
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:23,800
shouldn't come to a consensus and go 
ahead and play a game.

810
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,550
At least they're bloody while playing a 
game that,

811
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,990
that you know,
pretty much everybody has access to.

812
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,410
I think marginalized is a lot of times 
associated with oppression that the term

813
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:34,070
marginalized

814
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:39,070
and it's not necessarily the case and I 
think that society as a whole and 

815
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,620
civilization is sort of a work in 
progress.

816
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:44,621
We're,
we're working all this out and that's 

817
00:41:44,621 --> 00:41:47,081
one of the beautiful things about you 
being able to discuss these things on 

818
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:50,051
your youtube page as opposed to just 
having to battle it out inside the echo 

819
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:54,920
chamber of the universities.
You're able to express this stuff out in

820
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:59,921
the world where people like me that a 49
years old and aren't in college have a 

821
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:01,640
chance to read this and see like,
wow,

822
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:04,970
what is this guy going through over 
there at the University of Toronto?

823
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,630
And then you start to examine the laws 
and you start to look at what's going on

824
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:13,040
here and this egalitarianism utopia 
idea.

825
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:18,310
It's beautiful and it's concept that we 
should all be able to get along and 

826
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,180
everything should be equal.
The problem is it defies human nature.

827
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,390
It defies the 200,
300,000

828
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:28,391
years of DNA that we have bouncing 
around inside of our bodies that demand 

829
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,750
certain types of behavior and I think 
it's so important that we discuss these 

830
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:38,900
things and I think that society and 
civilization as a whole,

831
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:43,901
this,
this thing that is ultimately in this 

832
00:42:43,901 --> 00:42:45,140
growing state,
this constant state of improvement.

833
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,650
And,
and,

834
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,030
and objective interaction,
I mean,

835
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:54,740
there has to be some sort of discussion.
One of the problems that I have with the

836
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:59,741
soda,
so called Social Justice warriors and 

837
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:02,231
what this movement is that they're in 
forcing a certain type of thinking and 

838
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:05,660
behavior and their incredibly aggressive
about it.

839
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,320
Hence the

840
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,820
warrior term.
Yeah.

841
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:08,360
Well,
I think,

842
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:11,660
I think a fair bit of that is grounded 
again in temperament,

843
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:13,100
which is quite comical.
I mean,

844
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:18,490
one of the things that our research 
indicated research on political 

845
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,671
correctness indicated that his trait,
agreeableness is a good predictor of 

846
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:25,751
holding politically correct views and 
also that being female is a good 

847
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:26,540
predictor of holding politically correct
views.

848
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,280
And I think part of the reason for that 
and,

849
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:34,281
and the warrior aspect to it too,
is that agreeableness is a maternal 

850
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,070
instinct trait,
roughly speaking.

851
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,490
And you know,
human beings have very powerful maternal

852
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:45,491
instincts.
That's true for women and for men 

853
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:48,041
because men are very involved.
Male human beings are very involved in 

854
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:49,680
the raising of their children,
which makes them quite different than,

855
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,260
than many large animals.
Um,

856
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,430
on the one hand,
if you're a very maternal,

857
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:00,730
you're very compassionate and protective
of those that are within your kin 

858
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:04,610
boundary and you can try to include more
people in that if you want.

859
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:05,780
And,
and that's,

860
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:11,190
that's the political goal,
but you're unbelievably hostile to 

861
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,240
anyone who's outside of that that you 
regard as a threat slash predator.

862
00:44:14,241 --> 00:44:17,300
And so agreeableness,
agreeableness makes you divide the world

863
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:20,420
up into protected children and Predator 
and predators

864
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,160
and you see that on social justice 
warriors twitter pages.

865
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:28,430
I mean,
I follow a bunch of them and I go to 

866
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,741
them and I watched this ain't incredibly
supportive to ridiculously so in terms 

867
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:32,080
of like many

868
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,260
mediocre expressions tweets,
oh my God,

869
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:39,261
it's so brilliant.
And it's like you're saying almost 

870
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:41,571
nothing.
There's so incredibly supportive of the 

871
00:44:41,571 --> 00:44:44,010
people that think along their lines and 
so incredibly hostile.

872
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,000
And this,
uh,

873
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:50,020
this idea of shaming people that don't 
agree with them not interacting with 

874
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,450
them,
but almost immediately insulting them,

875
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,820
almost immediately marginalized.
And then,

876
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:57,600
which is ironic,
this is what you see constantly,

877
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:02,750
is like super supportive and super 
aggressive against people that have any 

878
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,110
sort of an opposing viewpoint.
Well,

879
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,600
they're all predators,
the ones that have an opposing viewpoint

880
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,900
and that's how they define them.
It's one of the things that's very 

881
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,031
comical about this from my perspective,
is that it's such sex stereotypical 

882
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:16,860
behavior.
Is that at the same time that the social

883
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:19,410
justice warriors are denouncing,
the idea that,

884
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,020
um,
psychology for example,

885
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:23,820
might have anything to do with sex 
differences.

886
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,820
They're acting out sex stereotype 
behavior like mad in terms of their 

887
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,640
persecution of predators and their 
protection of the,

888
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,960
of the Qin Qin slash ingroup.
So,

889
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,320
and you're,
you are a,

890
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:37,190
a social psychologist.
No,

891
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:37,710
no,
no,

892
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:40,310
I'm not.
I'm a clinical personality psychologist.

893
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:42,000
And what is the difference?
Well,

894
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:47,060
one of the differences is that 
personality and so and clinical 

895
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,301
psychology isn't a corrupt enterprise.
Whereas social psychology fundamentally 

896
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:54,231
is,
it's been going through an absolute 

897
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:54,830
internal revolution over the last two 
years because of all,

898
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:59,870
because of its own discovery that many 
of its fundamental studies in 

899
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:03,200
propositions are flawed.
I would say social psychology is the 

900
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,771
most social justice slash left leaning 
part of psychology and its methods are 

901
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,900
generally appalling there.
They're not well documented and they 

902
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,170
produce all sorts of categories that 
don't exist.

903
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,560
Whereas personality,
I know it seems like it might seem like 

904
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:21,560
trivial distinction to people outside of
the field,

905
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,620
but that these disciplines are quite 
separate from a historical perspective.

906
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,160
They developed quite separately.
Personality psychologists are very,

907
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:33,180
very careful about defining what they 
measure.

908
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,540
And so for example,
I studied the big five personality 

909
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:38,540
traits.
That's extroversion,

910
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:38,910
neuroticism,
agreeableness,

911
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,350
conscientiousness,
openness,

912
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,840
um,
and under openness falls,

913
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,960
intelligence,
these are very well documented.

914
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:50,961
We can really measure them,
we can't measure them as well as we 

915
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:53,541
would like to.
We've identified the biological basis 

916
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:56,780
for most of the traits and we understand
a fair bit about how they make people 

917
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:59,270
different.
And um,

918
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,760
and,
and personality psychologists have been 

919
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,341
very,
very careful about measurement were 

920
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:07,341
social psychologists are,
as a general rule,

921
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:07,680
very,
very cavalier about their,

922
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:13,100
about their concepts.
And that's led to a tremendous 

923
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,100
pollution,
I would say,

924
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,511
of the psychological literature.
The implicit association test is a good 

925
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:20,901
example of that.
That's the test that's being used to 

926
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:22,320
assess people's unconscious biases,
unconscious racial biases,

927
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:24,010
and so for example,
if,

928
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:29,120
if I showed you a bunch of pictures of 
black people in a bunch of photographs 

929
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,441
of white people and then I asked you to 
associate a good or a bad word with the 

930
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:36,910
black people are the white people to 
respond after you've seen the picture.

931
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,050
If you are white and you saw white 
photos,

932
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:46,051
you'd be faster at responding to the to 
the positive words and so they've used 

933
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:51,151
that as evidence of racism.
But part of the problem with that is 

934
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:52,990
that you can't distinguish it from a 
novelty response.

935
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,480
So I mean most people in a given racial 
group are far more familiar with members

936
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:03,481
of their racial group and the fact that 
they're more likely to associate 

937
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:07,081
negative things with racial groups that 
are outside of their racial group isn't 

938
00:48:07,081 --> 00:48:10,771
something that can be easily 
distinguished from just a novelty 

939
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:13,981
effect.
But they make wide ranging claims about 

940
00:48:13,981 --> 00:48:17,140
the inbuilt biases in people and also.
And that's lent.

941
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,200
And that's lent a impetus to these 
movements that are racing through 

942
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,461
corporations across the United States 
and governmental agencies where people 

943
00:48:26,461 --> 00:48:29,890
are being subjected to mandatory 
unconscious racial bias retraining.

944
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,480
And there's no evidence by the way,
that,

945
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:32,770
that works at all.

946
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,960
In fact,
the evidence that there is suggest quite

947
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:37,390
the contrary.
I saw this on one of your videos.

948
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:38,080
Um,
you were,

949
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:43,170
you were discussing how preposterous 
this is on one of your videos because 

950
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,231
one of the people that was opposing you 
was actually a part of something like 

951
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:46,231
this,
right?

952
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:46,231
Yeah.
Well,

953
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:50,851
the human resources and equity people at
the University of Toronto have made 

954
00:48:50,851 --> 00:48:55,381
mandatory unconscious racism training,
anti bias training,

955
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,790
and they've made it mandatory for their 
staff.

956
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,640
And I found that absolutely appalling.
First of all,

957
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:02,920
it's political.
It's political reeducation.

958
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:07,921
So when you say,
but mandatory like this is something 

959
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:07,921
that,
you know,

960
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:11,010
I didn't have to because I'm not a,
I'm not part of the human resources 

961
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:14,131
staff,
but the people that they're consulting 

962
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:16,981
with to implement these sorts of 
programs certainly have faculty and 

963
00:49:16,981 --> 00:49:17,380
students in their sites.
I mean,

964
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:19,720
these are,
these are trial runs for much broader,

965
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,480
uh,
rolling out of exactly this sort of,

966
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,510
of exactly this sort of a reeducation.

967
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,650
What's the methodology behind it and how
has this been,

968
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,640
has been vetted?
Oh,

969
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:34,450
I don't think it's been vetted at all.
The like if you're going to,

970
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,190
let's say you want to put in,
in,

971
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,430
into practice and educational process,
what you need to do is you need to 

972
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:44,480
measure the initial state validly so 
that your measure,

973
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:49,481
so you need to use multiple measures and
all those measures need to say the same 

974
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:52,951
thing.
So if you're going to accuse someone of 

975
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:55,021
racism,
you need several different measures of 

976
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:55,450
racism and then you have to show that 
across all the measures.

977
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:00,630
So like using different meters,
all the meters should read the same 

978
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,841
thing.
Then you have to implement your 

979
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:03,850
educational intervention carefully 
defined.

980
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:04,930
Then you have to,
do,

981
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:10,110
you have to see afterwards if the 
consequence of the educational effort 

982
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,080
was a reduction in those initial,
uh,

983
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,850
indices,
those additional measures,

984
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,640
that sort of thing when it's been done 
at all,

985
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:23,641
has showed that educational 
interventions of that sort that are 

986
00:50:23,641 --> 00:50:25,360
mandatory actually make racism and bias 
worse rather than better.

987
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:30,750
But why let a few facts stop you because
we already know from the postmodernists 

988
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,000
that there's no such thing as facts 
anyways.

989
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,650
So there's skin Canada here.
Here's something is one of the things 

990
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,740
that really makes me proud of my 
country.

991
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:45,670
Our government has now announced that 
the judiciary in Canada will be 

992
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:50,201
selected.
If you're going to be a candidate to be 

993
00:50:50,201 --> 00:50:52,691
a judge,
you have to produce a dossier that 

994
00:50:52,691 --> 00:50:52,691
specifies your,
your identities,

995
00:50:52,691 --> 00:50:54,320
whatever they happen to be racial,
ethnic,

996
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:57,200
religious,
and then you,

997
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:02,670
the committee that's going to appoint 
you to the judiciary has to have 

998
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,270
undergone mandatory anti racism and bias
training before they're allowed to serve

999
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,540
on the committee.
So basically we've set up a situation in

1000
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:13,541
Canada.
Where are the people who select their 

1001
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:16,661
judges have to go a kind of 
indoctrination that has no validity from

1002
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:19,940
a scientific perspective before they're 
allowed to select our judges.

1003
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,300
Now who's enforcing this where to 
justice minister,

1004
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,570
but where justice minister,
where did this program come from?

1005
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,700
All sorts of people who have,
who are,

1006
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:32,060
who are offering these programs now and 
so we've come a growth industry,

1007
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,660
but what is their qualifications?
That's a good question,

1008
00:51:35,661 --> 00:51:37,070
right?
Qualifications,

1009
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,740
zero browser rains.
Yeah.

1010
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:44,741
Well there's just no way of having 
qualifications for doing this sort of 

1011
00:51:44,741 --> 00:51:44,990
thing because it's not a valid 
procedure.

1012
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:49,070
So how does he claim to be qualified?
So they claim to be qualified.

1013
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:50,270
They come to the university and they 
say,

1014
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:55,271
I have a solution.
The university says finally just run 

1015
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:58,151
with it.
And they just implemented because to 

1016
00:51:58,151 --> 00:51:59,270
question anything that would absolve.
Racism is racist.

1017
00:51:59,330 --> 00:51:59,990
Yes,
right?

1018
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:05,530
Yes.
And they did that in collaboration with 

1019
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:06,190
the black liberation collective,
which is police that one because that,

1020
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:11,210
that one's adorable.
The black liberation collective isn't 

1021
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:11,210
that?

1022
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,860
Isn't that the group that somehow things
that white people are inferior because 

1023
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,341
they don't have enough melanin,
so it was started by a woman who said 

1024
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:22,661
exactly that she's a black supremacist 
and she said that the reason that the 

1025
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:26,980
reason that white people are inferior 
because they don't have enough melanin 

1026
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,980
in their skin and Melanin apparently is 
this agent.

1027
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:32,981
It's obviously it's a pigment,
but it's apparently this agent that 

1028
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:35,060
transforms cosmic energy into wisdom 
mean she's completely.

1029
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,750
You can make.
You can make up your own mind about her.

1030
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:43,751
And then the other person who started 
the black liberation collective is a 

1031
00:52:43,751 --> 00:52:45,770
woman who used to work for the 
University of Toronto Students Union who

1032
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,640
is now being pursued by that student's 
Union for embezzling $300,000

1033
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,040
of from,
from,

1034
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,830
from that organization with the help of 
a couple of her cronies.

1035
00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:00,130
Well,
why let a few facts stand in the way of 

1036
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:00,130
abolishing racism?

1037
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:00,130
Yeah.
Well,

1038
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:04,271
they also.
They also are perfectly willing to 

1039
00:53:04,271 --> 00:53:05,960
promote violent means of social 
transformation and the university claims

1040
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:07,950
that it's in favor of safety,
you know,

1041
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:12,960
because they've gone after me because my
refusal to use compelled pronouns is 

1042
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,871
apparently made the campus unsafe,
but they're perfectly willing to take 

1043
00:53:16,871 --> 00:53:19,130
advice from the black liberation 
collective and not only are they willing

1044
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:24,131
to take advice from them and not disavow
them despite their support for violent 

1045
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:28,590
means of of social revolution.
They're also pushing equality of outcome

1046
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:33,591
on their employees and the people who 
taught there mandatory anti racism and 

1047
00:53:33,591 --> 00:53:35,580
anti bias training program said outright
in their training material,

1048
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:40,581
which I have copies of that any 
institution that doesn't have equality 

1049
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:46,011
of outcome as as part of its 
characteristic at every level of the 

1050
00:53:46,011 --> 00:53:47,520
power organization is corrupt and should
be restructured.

1051
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:54,170
But that pales in comparison to my 
refusal to use compelled pronouns.

1052
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:57,120
Like obviously don't understand how this
gets so far.

1053
00:53:57,121 --> 00:54:02,121
I just don't understand how no one has.
There's no rational thinking involved in

1054
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:08,570
the administration and the and the 
people that are implementing these 

1055
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,211
ideas.
I just don't understand how it gets to 

1056
00:54:11,211 --> 00:54:11,370
the point where things get too terrible 
places.

1057
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,010
One tiny step at a time.
You know,

1058
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:19,011
if I encroach I,
if I encroach on you and I'm 

1059
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:19,350
sophisticated about it,
I'm going to encroach two millimeters.

1060
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,630
I'm going to encroach right to the point
where you start,

1061
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,580
start to protest,
then I'm going to stop,

1062
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,550
then I'm going to wait.
Then you're going to calm down.

1063
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,060
Then I'm going to encroach again,
right to the point where you protest.

1064
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,070
Then I'm going to stop,
then I'm going to wait,

1065
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,470
and I'm just going to do that forever.

1066
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,710
And before you know it,
you're going to be back three miles from

1067
00:54:37,711 --> 00:54:42,711
where you started and you'll have done 
it one step at a time and then you'll 

1068
00:54:42,711 --> 00:54:42,711
go,
oh,

1069
00:54:42,711 --> 00:54:43,140
how'd I get here?
And the answer was,

1070
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:48,141
well,
I pushed you a little farther than you 

1071
00:54:48,141 --> 00:54:48,141
should have gone,
and you agreed,

1072
00:54:48,141 --> 00:54:50,760
and so then I pushed you a little 
farther than you should've gone again.

1073
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:53,640
And you agreed,
and if anybody's interested in this sort

1074
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:55,710
of process,
and this is a horrifying book,

1075
00:54:55,711 --> 00:54:57,780
if you want to read about how this 
process works,

1076
00:54:57,781 --> 00:55:02,781
you can read a book called ordinary men 
by Robert Browning in ordinary men is 

1077
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:07,080
about browning,
was interested in how the Nazis trained.

1078
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:09,010
They're there,
they're there,

1079
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,060
they how they train people to kill 
basically.

1080
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:14,980
And so Robert Browning studied this 
police battalion.

1081
00:55:14,981 --> 00:55:19,500
It's very interesting book.
So these were middle aged German men.

1082
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,670
So they,
they were,

1083
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,970
they were raised and educated really 
before Hitler came to power.

1084
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:28,970
So they weren't indoctrinated Nazis,
they were policemen and when the Nazis 

1085
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,910
went through Poland and then and then 
needed to impose their brand of order on

1086
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,940
Poland,
they brought policemen and they brought 

1087
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,041
this battalion of middle aged policemen 
in and they're commandant.

1088
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,310
Their commander was by all accounts,
a pretty decent guy.

1089
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,500
And he told them that because it was war
time,

1090
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:48,690
they were probably going to have to do 
some pretty terrible things,

1091
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,300
but that they could go home if they 
didn't think they were up to it.

1092
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,370
So there was no compulsion.
You know,

1093
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:58,371
this wasn't a milgrim experiment or or 
an experiment where you had to obey 

1094
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:59,340
orders.
The guy who was giving the artist said,

1095
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:00,360
look,
this is going to be awful,

1096
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:02,040
but you can back off,
but the guys thought,

1097
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:07,041
well,
I'm not going to leave my comrades here 

1098
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:07,041
to do the dirty work,
you know,

1099
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:08,280
which is kind of a virtue in in a 
perverse way.

1100
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:13,080
And then Browning details how they went 
from ordinary policeman to guys who were

1101
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:18,081
taking naked pregnant women out into the
middle of fields and shooting them in 

1102
00:56:18,081 --> 00:56:21,231
the back of their head and they were 
physically ill during most of the 

1103
00:56:21,231 --> 00:56:21,780
transformation process.
You know,

1104
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:26,781
they started out by what?
Rounding up the Jewish men between the 

1105
00:56:26,781 --> 00:56:27,820
ages of 16 and 65,
while you know,

1106
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:29,980
you can kind of understand that because 
you're at war and then,

1107
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:31,660
well then they put them in stadiums and 
then,

1108
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,280
well then they had to shoot some of 
them.

1109
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:34,960
Then they had to load them on cattle 
cars.

1110
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:39,961
It was like one step at a time.
These guys were having a dreadful time 

1111
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:39,961
of it.
They didn't stop.

1112
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,960
They didn't stop.
And so that's how things get to where 

1113
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:45,960
they are now,
is that,

1114
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,410
I mean,
I know they're not at that point and I'm

1115
00:56:47,411 --> 00:56:49,540
not trying to make the case that they're
at that point.

1116
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:54,600
Well,
you're one of the first people that 

1117
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,741
sounding an alarm that there's,
there's a real issue with controlling 

1118
00:56:55,741 --> 00:56:58,861
people.
There's a real issue with controlling 

1119
00:56:58,861 --> 00:57:01,111
dialogue,
controlling the way people communicate 

1120
00:57:01,111 --> 00:57:02,650
and that these ideologies,
although seemingly innocuous,

1121
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,790
they can take you down very dangerous 
roads.

1122
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,350
Yes.
Well,

1123
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,950
seemingly innocuous ideology,
those words,

1124
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,010
innocuous ideology,
those words do not go together.

1125
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:17,070
There are no innocuous ideologies.
And there are forms of pathological 

1126
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,670
oversimplification and there are also 
clubs.

1127
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:23,671
I mean,
I mean the kind of clubs that you hit 

1128
00:57:23,671 --> 00:57:23,671
people with as well as the clubs that 
you belong to.

1129
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:27,670
The advantage to me being an idiot log 
is that I can explain everything.

1130
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,320
I can feel morally superior and I know 
who my enemies are.

1131
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,110
And you know what you're supposed to do 
with enemies.

1132
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,300
They're not your friends,
right?

1133
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:39,370
You move against them.
And you know,

1134
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:42,040
we're approaching a situation,
and this has already happened,

1135
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,020
I think more in the United States than 
in Canada,

1136
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:49,021
although our countries are competing to 
see who can cross the idiot line 

1137
00:57:49,021 --> 00:57:49,021
fastest.

1138
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,940
You're,
you're in a situation in the US where 50

1139
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:54,940
percent of your population won't talk to
the other 50 percent.

1140
00:57:55,630 --> 00:58:00,630
That's not good.
And I would say it's more pronounced on 

1141
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,241
the left liberal side because they 
regard everybody who voted for trump as 

1142
00:58:03,241 --> 00:58:03,280
essentially as an enemy.
It's like,

1143
00:58:03,281 --> 00:58:06,340
hey people,
that's 50 percent of your citizens.

1144
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,930
You might think about talking with them.
You know,

1145
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,030
people you can't talk to.
Those are enemies.

1146
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:18,210
My ironically,
I really truly believe that one of the 

1147
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,970
big factors in trump's rise to power is 
that people are sick of this 

1148
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:25,160
oversimplification in this ridiculous 
ideology coming from the left like that.

1149
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:27,820
This combined entity politic.
Exactly.

1150
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And so they've chosen an identity 
politics that opposes the identity 

1151
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,060
politics that they think is disgusting.
Yeah.

1152
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,650
And that's just starting.
It's just just start.

1153
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,500
That's right.
Well,

1154
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:43,501
if you teach,
if you teach one side to play identity 

1155
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:43,501
politics,
defacto,

1156
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:45,190
you teach the other side to play 
identity politics,

1157
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:50,490
and I've seen more and more people who 
are center people as far as I'm 

1158
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:54,211
concerned,
pushed to the right because of the 

1159
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:54,211
continual insistence that by their mere 
existence,

1160
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:59,071
they're part of the perpetrator group 
just by being a white person who is 

1161
00:58:59,071 --> 00:59:00,940
somehow or another successful.

1162
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:04,510
You are a privileged person.
You're part of the elite.

1163
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,030
You're part of the one percent.
You're a part of the problem.

1164
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,650
Yeah.
You're part of the oppressors.

1165
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,760
Yeah,
absolutely.

1166
00:59:09,761 --> 00:59:14,530
Or an oppressor by being just to just by
a person with a home in the suburbs.

1167
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:19,590
Well,
and it's also extremely annoying for 

1168
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,631
people who've worked really hard and 
who've made the requisite sacrifices to 

1169
00:59:21,631 --> 00:59:22,220
become along some

1170
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,220
dimension,
to have that immediately attributed to 

1171
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:30,011
their oppression and it's not.
It's not obvious that that's something 

1172
00:59:30,011 --> 00:59:31,550
we want to do.
It's like for the social justice warrior

1173
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:34,280
types out there who might be listening,
it's like,

1174
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:36,770
do you.
Are you really willing to say that every

1175
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:41,771
single person who's accomplished 
something as done that as a consequence 

1176
00:59:41,771 --> 00:59:45,431
of oppression,
that that's again what the Soviets 

1177
00:59:45,431 --> 00:59:46,370
claimed with regards to the to the 
successful peasants in the 19,

1178
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,920
in the just before the 19 twenties.
It's like,

1179
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,410
well,
the peasants weren't emancipated.

1180
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:54,570
They were serfs until about 30 years 
before that they were serfs.

1181
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,730
They were basically slaves and some of 
them had clambered up to the point where

1182
00:59:58,731 --> 01:00:02,810
maybe they could have owned their hot 
and a cow and you don't employ somewhat.

1183
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,700
While the Soviet claim was,
well,

1184
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:09,730
that's all theft.
You got that all because you're an 

1185
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:09,730
oppressor.

1186
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:12,910
And so then the Soviet intellectuals 
went into the villages and just imagine 

1187
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:13,340
how this happened.
So imagine a village,

1188
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,210
small town where everyone knows 
everybody and there's maybe 10,

1189
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:19,520
20 people there who are moderately 
successful.

1190
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,820
Okay?
And so you can imagine that those 20 

1191
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,651
people have like a 100 enemies at the 
bottom of the socioeconomic 

1192
01:00:26,651 --> 01:00:26,990
distribution.
Useless,

1193
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:32,050
horrible.
People who are jealous and resentful 

1194
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:32,050
about the fact that these people have 
been successful.

1195
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:33,890
Okay?
So now the intellectuals come in and say

1196
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,830
property is theft,
success is oppression,

1197
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:42,130
and then they looked for the people in 
the village who are willing to move 

1198
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:44,210
against those 20 successful people.
Well those guys at the bottom,

1199
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:46,580
those hundred resentful,
jealous,

1200
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,640
murderous people at the bottom there 
just waiting for an opportunity to go 

1201
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,181
kick down some doors.
And that's exactly what they did in the 

1202
01:00:55,181 --> 01:00:55,181
19 twenties.
And as I said,

1203
01:00:55,181 --> 01:00:59,261
they wiped out all their productive 
peasants and then 6 million Ukrainian 

1204
01:00:59,261 --> 01:00:59,840
starve to death.
They had posters.

1205
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,070
The Soviets produced posters in the 19 
thirties that said essentially,

1206
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:09,290
um,
don't forget it's wrong to eat your 

1207
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:09,290
children.

1208
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,810
So whoa.
Yeah,

1209
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:15,740
whoa.
There's nothing about the Soviet,

1210
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:20,890
there's nothing that you can imagine 
that's horrible enough so that it 

1211
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:23,720
matched the reality of what happened in 
the Soviet Union between 19,

1212
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:26,330
19 in 1959.
And you know,

1213
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:31,331
the West knew about this too early.
Malcolm Muggeridge in the thirties was 

1214
01:01:31,331 --> 01:01:31,580
documenting for,
for England,

1215
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:32,930
for,
for English newspapers,

1216
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:34,730
exactly what was going on in the Soviet 
Union.

1217
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,640
The bloody intellectuals didn't admit it
until the mid seventies,

1218
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,490
you know,
with the exception of people like George

1219
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:45,490
Orwell.
So why do these patterns repeat 

1220
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,570
themselves?
What is it about human beings?

1221
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,980
Well,
we like things simple.

1222
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:54,820
We like things simple.
So say you often like a simple 

1223
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:57,320
explanation is a good explanation unless
it's too simple.

1224
01:01:57,321 --> 01:02:00,830
But distinguishing between simple and 
too simple is no easy matter.

1225
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,950
We like,
we like to know who's our friend and our

1226
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:08,951
enemy and we liked the feeling of 
unearned moral superiority and moral 

1227
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:10,420
standard yard.

1228
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:10,840
Yeah,
that's,

1229
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:14,090
that's the challenge.
Especially when there's no such thing as

1230
01:02:14,091 --> 01:02:16,550
earning anyways.
So,

1231
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:21,551
and then,
I mean there's deeper and darker things 

1232
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:21,551
that are underneath that.
So like the,

1233
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:24,150
the human proclivity to pull down those 
who have more than you.

1234
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:29,260
It's like these kids on the campuses who
are claiming identity with the 

1235
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:29,260
oppressed,
you know,

1236
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:33,420
somewhere like Yale.
It's like how in the world you can speak

1237
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:36,660
of oppression if you happen to be at 
Yale is beyond me.

1238
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,830
I mean,
first of all,

1239
01:02:37,831 --> 01:02:40,530
your North American,
which puts you in the top one percent,

1240
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,670
and then of North Americans,
you're in the top one percent,

1241
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:48,120
the top one percent of one percent,
but yet you want that,

1242
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:51,930
you want to have all the power that goes
along with that and you want to have the

1243
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:56,931
moral superiority that comes from being 
a representative of the oppressed.

1244
01:02:57,721 --> 01:03:02,721
So that's exactly what you want.
You want all the power and you want all 

1245
01:03:02,721 --> 01:03:02,721
the victimization at the same time.

1246
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,460
Well,
yours.

1247
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,500
Yale is a great example because Yale was
one of what happened with the Halloween 

1248
01:03:09,281 --> 01:03:14,281
costume debacle at gale was one of the 
first videos that was released that made

1249
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:20,041
people horrified where they,
they couldn't believe how students were 

1250
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:20,170
communicating with professors.

1251
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:20,770
Yeah.
Well,

1252
01:03:20,771 --> 01:03:23,230
the student who,
who screamed up a storm about,

1253
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,530
about that,
uh,

1254
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,840
the male professor who was the husband 
of the woman who wrote the Pro Halloween

1255
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:33,841
costume letter,
it turned out she was on the bloody 

1256
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:34,300
hiring committee that hired him.
One of the things she screamed was,

1257
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:35,800
who hired you?
It was like,

1258
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,920
well,
it turned out it was you because you 

1259
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:40,920
were on the committee just a few years 
before.

1260
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,290
I know,
and they took it like,

1261
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,070
yeah,

1262
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:45,530
explain that to people that don't know 
what the hell we're talking about.

1263
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:50,680
Well,
the explain this debacle because it 

1264
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,070
really was about questionable Halloween 
costumes.

1265
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:57,380
Well,
it was about questioning Halloween 

1266
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,361
costumes.
Halloween costumes are a part of the 

1267
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,370
whole point of Halloween is to have 
questionable costumes.

1268
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,230
Right.
You play with depth for example,

1269
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:09,231
in decay and and horror and and it's,
it's a time when the norms with regards 

1270
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:16,251
to the expression of things that are 
outside of our normal behavior are 

1271
01:04:16,251 --> 01:04:19,731
suspended so that everybody can,
can have a little celebration as it 

1272
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:20,430
turns out.
Well,

1273
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,650
you know,
campuses have got all upset about things

1274
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:26,730
like cultural appropriation at Queen's 
University in Canada just the other week

1275
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:30,540
they were going after students who are 
dressing up as Vietcong for example,

1276
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:31,530
or Mexicans.
It's like,

1277
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:35,070
I just don't see what the hell is racist
about dressing up like a Mexican.

1278
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,730
Mexicans have a traditional traditional 
clothing.

1279
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,420
There's nothing wrong with Mexicans,
so why is it wrong?

1280
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:43,730
Just dress up like that.

1281
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,830
If you want to be Poncho via for 
Halloween,

1282
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:46,610
what's wrong with that?

1283
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:51,820
Oh,
well we'll give you can you can regard 

1284
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:51,820
that as an image just as much as a 
denigration.

1285
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,160
It's like why is that such a problem?
Right.

1286
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:58,350
But anyways,
it doesn't matter because nothing's too 

1287
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,451
trivial to be a problem to a social 
justice warrior and because they don't 

1288
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:03,130
like to deal with real problems.
And Yale went after Halloween

1289
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:08,170
costs.
So this woman wrote a letter saying 

1290
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,030
maybe we should just relax about this 
stuff and you know,

1291
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:15,031
and not,
don't put restrictions on what people 

1292
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:17,651
wear for Halloween,
but let people decide what is and isn't 

1293
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:17,651
offensive.

1294
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:17,690
Yes.
Well in

1295
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,370
many Halloween costumes are offensive.
That's the point.

1296
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,510
But her letter was in a really 
reasonable.

1297
01:05:24,511 --> 01:05:26,050
It was perfectly reasonable.
It was like,

1298
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,170
it was like an adult wrote it.
Yes.

1299
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:28,750
Yeah.
And,

1300
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:31,780
and you know,
all hell broke loose and she ended up.

1301
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,340
She ended up quitting and I think he 
did.

1302
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,200
No,
I don't think.

1303
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,100
I don't think he left.
I don't think he left,

1304
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:42,101
but she did.
Seeing him bow down to this woman 

1305
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:44,990
screaming at him in his face was so 
disturbing.

1306
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:49,550
It was so humiliating.
I felt so humiliated for him because she

1307
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:51,560
was screaming,
this is our home.

1308
01:05:51,561 --> 01:05:55,070
What the fuck are you doing?
You're not making it home.

1309
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,680
The university's not a home,
right?

1310
01:05:56,770 --> 01:06:00,130
It's not a safe space.
It's not a secure space.

1311
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,500
None of that.
And,

1312
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:03,270
and if,
if that,

1313
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:08,440
when they get a university isn't a home,
that's not what it is.

1314
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,850
It's a place to be confronted by,
I would say often horrible ideas.

1315
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,610
You want to learn about history,
you think that's going to be safe.

1316
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,360
Do you know what human history is like?
It's an endless blood bath with,

1317
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:24,630
with,
with a certain amount of hopeful 

1318
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:24,630
progress underlying it.
It's,

1319
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:24,640
it's a,
it's a,

1320
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:27,580
it's a horror show and great literature 
is like that.

1321
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:28,470
And,
and,

1322
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:33,160
and biology is terrifying and physics is
terrifying and you want to be safe.

1323
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:35,740
It's stay home.
Stay home with your mom,

1324
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:40,860
stay home with your dad.
Don't come to university if you want to 

1325
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:41,070
be safe because even go outside.
No,

1326
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:46,080
why don't we have you if you're going.
If the university is going to make you 

1327
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,260
safe,
then it ceased to be a university,

1328
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,750
so one of the things I try to do in my 
class,

1329
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:51,430
I have this class called maps of 
meaning,

1330
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:56,431
which concentrates on atrocity basically
on Soviet atrocity and and Nazi 

1331
01:06:57,041 --> 01:07:02,041
atrocities mostly,
and what I try to do in the class is to 

1332
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:04,450
teach my students that had they been in 
Nazi Germany in the 19 thirties,

1333
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,600
they would have been Nazis and had they 
been offered the opportunity to be an 

1334
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,681
Auschwitz,
Auschwitz camp guard than maybe they 

1335
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:14,170
would have leapt at it and maybe they 
would have been in the sadistic,

1336
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:18,880
in the more sadistic proportion of the 
Auschwitz camp guard population.

1337
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:24,180
You think that makes you feel safe.
It doesn't make you feel safe to know 

1338
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,720
that Nazis were humans and you happen to
be one of them.

1339
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:31,620
So I think that educators that tell 
students that they're offering them a 

1340
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,400
safe space are doing them a profound 
disservice.

1341
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:38,401
And you don't.
I'm a clinical psychologist and here's 

1342
01:07:38,401 --> 01:07:39,790
one of the things you do to make people 
less afraid.

1343
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:45,750
You don't make the world safer.
What you do is you people tell you what 

1344
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:51,751
they're afraid of and then you break it 
into little bits so that they can go 

1345
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:51,751
confront them.
You know,

1346
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:54,200
so maybe they afraid of going to a party
and you break that down.

1347
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:54,610
You say,
well,

1348
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:56,230
do you know how to introduce yourself?
And he said,

1349
01:07:56,231 --> 01:08:01,231
well,
I know I don't really even know how to 

1350
01:08:01,231 --> 01:08:02,431
shake someone's hand.
And so then you practice having them 

1351
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:05,161
shake their hand and introduce 
themselves because maybe they weren't 

1352
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:05,161
taught by that by their halfway did 
parents,

1353
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:06,610
when they were,
when they were young,

1354
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,830
because they were ignored and so then 
you say,

1355
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:13,831
well maybe you can go to a party for 
half an hour and all you have to do is 

1356
01:08:13,831 --> 01:08:15,860
introduce yourself to people and we'll 
call that success and you build up their

1357
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:16,490
competence

1358
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:21,490
and their confidence one step at a time.
And what happens to the clinical 

1359
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,930
literature indicates quite clearly is 
you don't make people less anxious.

1360
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:26,270
By doing that,
you make them braver.

1361
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:31,640
It's not the same thing.
You don't make the world and its horrors

1362
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:37,060
smaller.
You make the person and their their 

1363
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,090
their capacity to deal with horror 
larger.

1364
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,670
You encourage them,
you strengthened them.

1365
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:44,240
Now that's what you do at a university.
You arm people with arguments,

1366
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,980
you hone their intellect,
you,

1367
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,890
you help them learn to write so they can
marshal their arguments.

1368
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:53,891
You,
you'll help them learn how to engage in 

1369
01:08:53,891 --> 01:08:55,721
intellectual combat because that's 
better than engaging in real combat and 

1370
01:08:55,721 --> 01:08:57,920
you make them.
You make them hard and strong.

1371
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:02,900
You don't mollycoddle them and make them
safe unless you're their enemy,

1372
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,210
unless you're trying to devour their 
spirit.

1373
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,510
And that's what we have in the 
universities we have.

1374
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:11,450
We have the reign of the diploe mother 
who's,

1375
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,620
who's answered everything is,
Oh,

1376
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:15,590
just come a little closer and I'll 
protect you from the world.

1377
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,160
It's just like Hansel and Gretel,
the,

1378
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:18,920
you know,
the,

1379
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,060
the,
the witch,

1380
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:21,710
and the Hansel and Gretel story.
Well,

1381
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:24,440
my house is made of gingerbread.
Just come in here and everything will be

1382
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:25,370
fine.
While she feeds,

1383
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:27,440
you can need to fatten you up so she can
eat you.

1384
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,170
That's the archetype of a modern 
university.

1385
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,440
When did this start?
When did the trigger warnings,

1386
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:36,320
when did the safe spaces,
when did all this emerge?

1387
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:41,710
Well,
it has its roots in the student 

1388
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:41,710
radicalism of the 19 sixties,
especially the far left radical Islam.

1389
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:47,230
It really popped up in the 19 nineties 
and the early nineties when I was 

1390
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:51,251
teaching in the US at that point and 
which university I taught at Harvard 

1391
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:54,821
from 93 to 98 and there was a fair push 
for political correctness especially in 

1392
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,990
the early part of the nineties but,
but it,

1393
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:03,050
it got pushed back down and disappeared 
and went under ground and went 

1394
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:06,461
underground is more accurate and then 
it's just come back with a vengeance in 

1395
01:10:06,461 --> 01:10:09,590
the last five years and I think it's 
partly because we have all these radical

1396
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:13,400
left political activists departments at 
the universities.

1397
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:18,400
Women's studies being at the top of the 
list that have done nothing for the last

1398
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:22,040
30 years to even longer than that.
Now it's almost 40 years,

1399
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,330
30 years,
let's say,

1400
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:28,010
have done nothing but producing a never 
ending stream of ideological.

1401
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:33,011
He minded counter civilization,
political activists and that's all 

1402
01:10:33,171 --> 01:10:36,380
subsidized by,
by tuition and by the public purse.

1403
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:41,500
And that's another thing we really got 
to ask ourselves is why the hell are we 

1404
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,540
subsidizing revolution?
Why are we doing that?

1405
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:49,010
It's crazy and it's dangerous.
It's dangerous.

1406
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,190
What?
So what exactly is going on with women's

1407
01:10:55,191 --> 01:10:58,730
studies that you believe is fostering 
revolution?

1408
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,100
Well,
you'd go on their websites and read,

1409
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,050
read what they say.
I mean,

1410
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:03,950
first of all,
for the,

1411
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:06,600
for the women's studies types,
and this is a,

1412
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,940
what would you call it,
a false anthropology.

1413
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:15,941
There's this idea that way back when 
there was a feminist paradise,

1414
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,870
uh,
and that would be like noble savage mode

1415
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:23,340
of living where everything was 
egalitarianism and a women dominated.

1416
01:11:23,341 --> 01:11:28,260
It was a matriarchal culture that was 
put forward by Ucla anthropologist named

1417
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:30,750
[inaudible].
I can never pronounce her name properly,

1418
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:35,751
but I think I got it.
And then that was overthrown by 

1419
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:38,180
patriarchal institutions essentially 
starting at about the time say,

1420
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:38,940
of the,
of,

1421
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:40,140
of,
of Judaism.

1422
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:45,860
And that was all overthrown.
And ever since then we've lived in an 

1423
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,710
oppressive patriarchy.
And that's what our culture is.

1424
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:51,710
It's an oppressive patriarchy.
So they're pointing to one unsuccessful 

1425
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:51,950
society that they believe existed or did
it?

1426
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:52,890
No,
no,

1427
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,020
it didn't exist.
There's no evidence for whatsoever.

1428
01:11:55,021 --> 01:11:55,720
It's,
it's,

1429
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:57,300
it's complicated,
but it's the,

1430
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:02,570
it's the telling of a kind of 
psychological myth as if it was history 

1431
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:03,150
and,
and,

1432
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,620
and anyway.
So,

1433
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:08,640
so the basic claim is that Western 
civilization is a brutish patriarchy and

1434
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:13,641
that whatever positive things that 
might've managed to accomplish were all 

1435
01:12:13,641 --> 01:12:14,670
accomplished as a consequence of 
oppression and,

1436
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,620
and uh,
and theft,

1437
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:21,720
and that the appropriate thing to do is 
to restructure it from the bottom up and

1438
01:12:21,721 --> 01:12:25,260
they mean that they mean that they mean 
every single bloody concept.

1439
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:30,261
And you can marry that with modern 
postmodernism and throw in a nice stash 

1440
01:12:30,261 --> 01:12:33,651
of Marxism and you have the,
the ideological and motivated grounds 

1441
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:39,291
for social revolution.
And I'm just go online and look at a 

1442
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:41,970
dozen women studies websites.

1443
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:45,030
Just read them.
You can see what they say.

1444
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:46,990
They produce political activists and 
error.

1445
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,040
A goal is to restructure the patriarchy.
Well,

1446
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:55,041
what's the patriarchy?
While the patriarchy is Western 

1447
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:55,041
civilization and what is restructure 
mean?

1448
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,500
That's easy.
It means tear it down and destroy it.

1449
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:03,620
Why?
Because it's a brutish system that's 

1450
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,720
predicated on nothing but oppression.
It's nothing but a tyranny in the.

1451
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:08,940
In the eyes of the,
of the radical women's studies types.

1452
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,340
Heterosexuality.
That's a tyranny.

1453
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:12,840
Capitalism.
That's a tyranny.

1454
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:13,780
Democracy.
Well,

1455
01:13:13,781 --> 01:13:15,420
that doesn't even exist,
and even if it did,

1456
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:18,420
it would be a tyranny.
Everything's a tyranny,

1457
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:22,920
and so you can ask these and what would 
they replace it with?

1458
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:25,590
They replace it with their own 
ideological utopia.

1459
01:13:25,591 --> 01:13:28,200
While we've already had 100 years of 
that and we saw what happened.

1460
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:29,310
Oh,
well that doesn't matter.

1461
01:13:29,311 --> 01:13:31,830
That wasn't real Marxism.
That's what the bloody marks is.

1462
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:34,410
Always say that wasn't real Marxism.
It's like,

1463
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:39,440
oh,
how many millions of people have to die 

1464
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,051
before you're convinced that it's real 
Marxism and I know what they mean by 

1465
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:42,051
that too.
They mean,

1466
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:44,430
hey,
if I was the Marxists dictator,

1467
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,670
things would've gone a lot better.
It's like a.

1468
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,460
You should think again,
sunshine.

1469
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:56,030
If you were the Marxists dictator,
things wouldn't have gotten a lot 

1470
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:58,760
better.
So if you're the sort of person that 

1471
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:58,760
thinks that if you would have been 
controlled,

1472
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,111
things would have gone a lot better than
you're exactly the sort of person who 

1473
01:14:03,111 --> 01:14:04,740
should never be in control.
So,

1474
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:07,200
and it's resentment.
It's horrible.

1475
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:08,340
Resentment,
you know?

1476
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:11,230
That's an important point because I 
think this is something that you've said

1477
01:14:11,231 --> 01:14:12,130
that I absolutely agree

1478
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,850
with that I think a lot of this thinking
and the way people are behaving,

1479
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:21,180
it seems based on revenge.
It seems based on revenge for awkward 

1480
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:25,530
upbringings,
social uncomfortable of 

1481
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:28,680
uncomfortability,
that it seems like there's something 

1482
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,410
about the way they view the world where 
they want to get back at people that 

1483
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:32,200
have literally done them no wrong.

1484
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:36,170
It's resentment for the burden of being.
It's deeper.

1485
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:41,230
It's deeper.
I mean human being human existence is 

1486
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:41,230
characterized by a fair bit of 
suffering.

1487
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:43,190
You know,
we're limited creatures and life is very

1488
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:44,630
hard.
Everyone dies.

1489
01:14:44,631 --> 01:14:47,210
Everyone you love is going to die.
Most of the things you do,

1490
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,520
all of the things you do will eventually
fail.

1491
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:55,130
You know,
suffering is a certainty and it's very 

1492
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:55,130
easy for people to become resentful 
about,

1493
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,990
about being,
about existence.

1494
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,450
You know,
these kids who shoot up high schools and

1495
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,970
and and the,
these mass shooters there,

1496
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:06,980
they're the perfect examples of,
of people who run on nothing but 

1497
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,060
resentment.
They're out to kill the innocent because

1498
01:15:08,061 --> 01:15:13,061
that's the best marker of a.
that's the best way of showing just how 

1499
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:14,660
much contempt they have for existence 
itself.

1500
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,060
Why punish the guilty?
They deserve to be punished.

1501
01:15:17,061 --> 01:15:19,770
It's a lot more malevolent and,
and,

1502
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,510
and,
and,

1503
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,600
and vengeful to punish the innocent.
It's like people are motivated to a 

1504
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,600
great degree by resentment of being and 
a huge chunk of that is manifested in,

1505
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,330
out to the dark side of the ideological 
possession.

1506
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:38,110
So I get to decide who my enemies are 
and then I get to go after them and I 

1507
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:41,291
can go after them for every single thing
that's ever been done to me that isn't 

1508
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:42,890
good and we'll a lot of that's just 
built into the structure of existence.

1509
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:46,550
Then they group up,
they the exhibit confirmation bias.

1510
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:51,580
They all form some sort of a group.
Think and then they act accordingly and 

1511
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,880
this is what you've been warning against
and this is where I completely agree 

1512
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,871
with you in this why I think the subject
is so important and I love the way 

1513
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:04,451
you've outlined all the steps and the 
problems with Marxism and ideologies in 

1514
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:08,771
general that we are dealing with this.
These are the beginning steps of it and 

1515
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:11,330
people who look at it now and they say 
it's social change and social justice.

1516
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:12,410
It's not.

1517
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:13,760
It's not.
It's not.

1518
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:14,690
That's right.
It's not.

1519
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:20,080
This is not going to improve things.
Implementing these policies will make 

1520
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:20,080
things worse.
They've made things worse.

1521
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:24,911
Every single place they've ever been 
implemented and often they've made 

1522
01:16:24,911 --> 01:16:28,511
things so much worse that you actually 
can't imagine it and people don't do the

1523
01:16:28,911 --> 01:16:30,140
reading.
I've done the reading,

1524
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:33,320
I've done the reading.
I know how bad things can get.

1525
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,290
They can get so bad that no matter how 
bad you think they are,

1526
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,910
you're not even in the bloody ballpark.

1527
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:43,930
Well,
it's just so strange that these sort of 

1528
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:46,660
courses and these sort of Ida ideologies
are thriving in universities and it's 

1529
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,750
really disconcerting to someone who has 
children.

1530
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,880
You know,
that your children are going to go there

1531
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:56,060
and they trade schools.
You know,

1532
01:16:56,061 --> 01:16:57,440
I think,
I think that,

1533
01:16:57,441 --> 01:16:59,510
wow,
that guy used to teach at Harvard,

1534
01:16:59,511 --> 01:17:01,880
just send them to trade schools.
The universities.

1535
01:17:01,881 --> 01:17:02,530
I think.
I think

1536
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:07,530
the universities,
I think you can make a reasonable case 

1537
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:07,530
that the universities do more harm than 
good.

1538
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:09,680
Now I hate to say that.
Well,

1539
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:10,190
this also,

1540
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,550
this is a strange time where access to 
information is so incredibly easy.

1541
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,560
You can get,
you could educate yourself,

1542
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,140
right?
Seemingly endlessly online.

1543
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,600
Um,
and with books and just,

1544
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:24,830
there's so much information available.
It says not the 19 thirties does,

1545
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:29,920
it's not a time where it was difficult 
to get an education outside of the 

1546
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,150
university the universities may have,
or the university,

1547
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:37,510
which is like the repository of human 
wisdom and the attempt to expand that 

1548
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:42,280
may have already moved outside the 
universities.

1549
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:46,010
You know,
just because an institution calls itself

1550
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:51,011
the university doesn't mean it is.
And many disciplines have turned into 

1551
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:54,010
ideological factories and so where's the
university mean?

1552
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:59,020
The university is wherever,
where anyone wants to learn about their 

1553
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:02,090
culture and where anyone wants to expand
the domain of human competence.

1554
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,220
And a lot of that's happening online 
now,

1555
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,410
so maybe that's the future.

1556
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:08,630
The only thing the universities have 
now,

1557
01:18:08,631 --> 01:18:12,050
I think that that people can't get 
elsewhere is accreditation,

1558
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:17,410
but they're doing everything they can as
fast as possible to make their 

1559
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:19,280
accreditation valueless anyways.
So yeah,

1560
01:18:19,281 --> 01:18:19,970
it's really,
it's.

1561
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:25,060
Yeah,
it's a terrible thing to say that the 

1562
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:27,611
universities may do more harm than good.
And I haven't come to that conclusion 

1563
01:18:27,611 --> 01:18:27,611
lightly.
Well,

1564
01:18:27,611 --> 01:18:29,300
there's also say it.
I'm sure you do.

1565
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,800
There's also a gigantic financial stake.
The amount of money that it will not.

1566
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,950
And that's especially the case in the 
US.

1567
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:41,020
I mean,
one of the things that's happened over 

1568
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,641
the last 30 years is that the,
the proportion of university 

1569
01:18:42,641 --> 01:18:44,060
expenditures that's gone to the 
administration has,

1570
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:46,370
has massively,
massively increased.

1571
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,210
And at the same time the student loan 
burden has increased.

1572
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:55,540
And so what's happened and the weird 
senses that the administrators have 

1573
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:58,661
conspired to steal the future earnings 
of their students and then you can't 

1574
01:18:59,181 --> 01:19:00,230
declare bankruptcy.

1575
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:05,350
So to me it's indentured servitude,
but you can't declare bankruptcy on 

1576
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:07,610
student loan.
You cannot declare bankruptcy on student

1577
01:19:07,611 --> 01:19:09,350
loans.
So you think about that.

1578
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,590
You tell me what difference there is 
between that and indentured servitude.

1579
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,800
There's not much because it's the only 
thing that I can even think of where 

1580
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,480
that corporations can go bankrupt.
They do it all the time.

1581
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:22,230
Ken individuals can.
Businesses can fail you.

1582
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:27,270
You can be deemed incompetent or not 
capable of paying your debt in every 

1583
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:30,290
other case,
but not with universities.

1584
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,180
Right?
That's crazy.

1585
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,490
It is crazy.
It's crazy because they were just trying

1586
01:19:34,491 --> 01:19:38,090
to combat the issue where so many kids 
were defaulting on their student loans.

1587
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,510
They try to make you perpetually 
responsible for it or you know.

1588
01:19:41,511 --> 01:19:44,000
The idea is that these kids have to 
learn responsibility.

1589
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:48,160
Is that the way to do it?
By overcharging them for some users will

1590
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:53,480
say that it's not a particularly useful 
to burden your citizenry with with a 

1591
01:19:55,011 --> 01:20:00,011
massive debt.
As soon as they graduate at a time when 

1592
01:20:00,011 --> 01:20:01,040
they're most likely to take 
entrepreneurial risks,

1593
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:06,100
yes.
You know you're not going to take 

1594
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:06,100
entrepreneurial risks if you're so 
burdened with debt,

1595
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:06,710
you can't get yourself off the ground.
Yeah,

1596
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:08,580
and we're talking about hundreds of 
thousands

1597
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,280
of dollars in debt with people that are.
If you're lucky,

1598
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,840
you're going to make what?
Forty,

1599
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:14,790
$50,000
a year straight out of college.

1600
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:19,791
If you're lucky,
so you're dealing with the amount of 

1601
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:23,151
money that you would have to make if you
didn't pay any taxes or didn't have any 

1602
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,091
expenses.
You'd have to work for four or five 

1603
01:20:26,091 --> 01:20:28,161
years longer than you would actually be 
in college to get that degree in the 

1604
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:28,770
first place.
It's insane.

1605
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:29,700
It's insane.

1606
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,130
Alright.
Would you say to,

1607
01:20:31,131 --> 01:20:32,780
to the university students are 
listening,

1608
01:20:32,781 --> 01:20:34,610
like a lot of your professors are 
Marxists.

1609
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,860
Ask them,
ask them if they're Marxists.

1610
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:41,950
Read the Gulag archipelago first because
you need to get your arguments together 

1611
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:46,091
and nobody and won a Nobel prize for 
that book and for his other writing and 

1612
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,780
it was one of the.
One of the key.

1613
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,800
There was a couple of things that 
brought down the Soviet Union,

1614
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:57,310
but one of them was Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn's book and he demolished 

1615
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:58,700
the intellectual credibility of of 
Marxism forever,

1616
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:03,850
but you have to read the damn book and 
you got to get your arguments in order 

1617
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:05,510
to go after your Marxist professors ask 
them difficult book to read,

1618
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:08,030
a very difficult book to read.
It's a very difficult book,

1619
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:10,730
although it's difficult because it's so 
horrifying.

1620
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:13,820
It's not difficult,
particularly because it's impenetrable.

1621
01:21:13,821 --> 01:21:16,340
It's in fact,
it's an absolutely fascinating book in,

1622
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:21,350
in,
in the same way that at that it's 

1623
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,350
terrible.
Horror story is fascinating,

1624
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:24,380
but.
But there's no excuse for this.

1625
01:21:24,381 --> 01:21:26,840
There's no excuse for these.
These professors who,

1626
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:29,890
who claim who claimed to be benevolent 
Marxist.

1627
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:32,520
So I think the way you framed it is very
important.

1628
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:37,521
I think the way you framed it as them 
being compassionate intellectuals that 

1629
01:21:37,521 --> 01:21:41,560
are inclined toward this,
because on the surface it seems like 

1630
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,040
it's what a compassionate intellectual 
would would support.

1631
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:45,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1632
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:48,900
And it's the unthinking adherence to 
compassion as the highest moral virtue.

1633
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:52,200
And it's also whenever you have an 
ideology,

1634
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:57,230
whenever you have these rigid 
established forms of communication or 

1635
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:58,890
methods of thinking,
ew,

1636
01:21:58,960 --> 01:21:59,820
ew,
ew,

1637
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:01,560
box people in your box,
people,

1638
01:22:01,561 --> 01:22:05,130
then you control them and you get them 
to stick inside that ideology.

1639
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:06,930
And in doing so,
you suppress people.

1640
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:11,931
It's so ironic that the people that are 
against suppressing are actually 

1641
01:22:11,931 --> 01:22:16,011
suppressing people through enforcing 
these ideologies and suppressing the 

1642
01:22:16,011 --> 01:22:19,950
marketplace of free ideas.
You're not allowed to have free ideas.

1643
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:21,450
You're not allowed to debate these 
things.

1644
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:22,260
I mean,
I've seen.

1645
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:27,530
There was that really famous instance at
the University of Toronto where there's 

1646
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:29,540
one guy,
I don't even remember what it barrel.

1647
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,380
Yes.
What was his more?

1648
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:32,450
Yeah,
why men make.

1649
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,750
Yeah.
It was a multivariate analysis of the,

1650
01:22:34,751 --> 01:22:38,170
of the income disparity between men and 
women.

1651
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:43,290
He used to be a feminist activist.
He decided to go look into the claim 

1652
01:22:43,721 --> 01:22:46,960
that women were making.
I think at the time it was seventy cents

1653
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:48,880
for every dollar that men were making.
He thought,

1654
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,810
well,
I have daughters.

1655
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:51,970
I better go check this out and see,
you know,

1656
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:54,220
do a little bit of indepth 
investigating.

1657
01:22:54,221 --> 01:22:59,221
And what he found out was that there 
were many reasons for the disparity and 

1658
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:02,230
perhaps one of them was unfair 
discrimination,

1659
01:23:02,231 --> 01:23:06,250
but there were another dozen and they 
seem to account more of the disparity

1660
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,050
than the discrimination.
I mean,

1661
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:12,030
just the fact that men take the more 
dangerous jobs is a,

1662
01:23:12,031 --> 01:23:14,290
is a huge contributor to that.
And it's not trivial.

1663
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:16,960
You should get paid more if you're 
putting your limbs on the line,

1664
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,370
you know,
I mean,

1665
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:20,590
are you grew up in northern Alberta 
where were,

1666
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:25,650
were a lot of young men dropped out of 
school and went and worked on the oil 

1667
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:25,650
rigs.
It's like you go try that.

1668
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,040
Well maybe you could do it,
but you know,

1669
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:29,200
the guys would lose their fingers.
They'd lose their toes.

1670
01:23:29,201 --> 01:23:34,201
They was 40 bloody below up there and 
they'd be wrestling pipe in the middle 

1671
01:23:34,201 --> 01:23:35,020
of the bush.
I have a friend who does it.

1672
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,180
I have a friend who does that in 
northern Alberta.

1673
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,130
Horrific it is.
It's tough work,

1674
01:23:39,131 --> 01:23:40,930
man.
And you're out in the Bush for two weeks

1675
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:43,480
and when you go outside,
there's temperatures where you literally

1676
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:45,520
can't be outside of your truck for more 
than 30 minutes.

1677
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,350
Right?
You have to jump back in the truck.

1678
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:49,360
And that was called life where I grew 
up.

1679
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,010
Yeah,
absolutely.

1680
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:51,980
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1681
01:23:51,981 --> 01:23:56,981
Those are very difficult jobs and 
they're very high pain because people 

1682
01:23:56,981 --> 01:23:57,040
die.
Hard work.

1683
01:23:57,041 --> 01:23:58,900
And there's not a lot of women taking 
those jobs.

1684
01:23:58,950 --> 01:23:59,390
No.
And,

1685
01:23:59,391 --> 01:24:00,700
and,
and a good thing too.

1686
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:01,960
So this guy,
um,

1687
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,580
I'm sorry,
what is his name again?

1688
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,590
Warren Farrell,
Warren Farrell,

1689
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:10,090
who wrote this book was giving a speech 
about this book and it was,

1690
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:15,160
the response was so unbelievably violent
and crazy and aggressive and also 

1691
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:19,270
ignorant,
ignorant to what he was saying,

1692
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:24,330
ignorant and not,
not wanting to debate the facts but 

1693
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:24,330
wanting to call him a massage,
misogynist,

1694
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:28,720
wanting to call this a hate speech.
And that's a favorite man.

1695
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:34,250
Already accused of that twice in the 
last two months because I don't want to 

1696
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:38,401
use these compelled pronouns.
Just like the one woman in the debate 

1697
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:40,540
that you had with the other man that I 
believe is transsexual.

1698
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:43,600
Yeah.
The one woman who was trying to say what

1699
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:48,601
is the difference between not using 
those words and using racial slurs and 

1700
01:24:49,871 --> 01:24:53,890
hate speech to to describe these people 
like the idea,

1701
01:24:53,891 --> 01:24:58,891
just the idea that that's a woman who is
a professor who's expressing it in that 

1702
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:03,541
way.
What is the difference between not 

1703
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:05,401
choosing to use made up pronouns versus 
calling someone a generally accepted 

1704
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,420
racial slurs that they're trying to 
frame that as the same thing.

1705
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,350
The racial intellectually dishonest to 
the racial slurs are also legal.

1706
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:20,280
So what's happening is the law is 
already there is already such that not 

1707
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:24,010
using one of these made up pronouns is a
crime.

1708
01:25:24,011 --> 01:25:26,320
Whereas using a racial epithet isn't.

1709
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,090
Wow.

1710
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,870
Wow.
That's crazy.

1711
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,240
That's crazy.
So you could use the n word.

1712
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:34,950
No,
it's legally to.

1713
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:37,290
Yes,
but you can't use you,

1714
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:39,480
can't you?
You can have zero.

1715
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:44,070
He's have to say aZ who.

1716
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,460
Wow,

1717
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,610
this is crazy.
This is really crazy.

1718
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:55,150
This is a bizarre moment in time.
Whereas Bizarre postural nature of it is

1719
01:25:56,061 --> 01:26:00,570
so undeniable that it's forcing a lot of
people and I,

1720
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:04,040
I applaud you for doing what you're 
doing

1721
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,210
and risking your,
your,

1722
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:10,410
your status with the university,
risking your support of your peers and 

1723
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:14,440
sticking your neck out the way you've 
been doing with your youtube videos 

1724
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:17,740
because if you hadn't done that,
there's a lot of people who wouldn't be 

1725
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,880
aware of how insidious and what you were
describing earlier.

1726
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:23,300
The creep is slow creep towards pushing 
forward,

1727
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:28,420
waiting for you to object waiting and 
then moving forward a little bit more 

1728
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:28,420
and once you relax.
Yup.

1729
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,210
Because that's what this is.
Yeah.

1730
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:30,760
Yeah.
And it's,

1731
01:26:30,761 --> 01:26:31,730
it's been,
it's been,

1732
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,470
it's been bizarre.
I can tell you that.

1733
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:37,550
I mean my son and I counted the number 
of press articles that have been devoted

1734
01:26:37,551 --> 01:26:39,260
to this.
These are serious press articles.

1735
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:42,190
This doesn't count youtube or radio or 
TV or any of those things.

1736
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:45,080
I mean the youtube coverage has been,
I would say overwhelming.

1737
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:50,380
There's been 170 major press articles 
written about those videos in the last 

1738
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:50,380
two months.

1739
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:53,660
And what's the general consensus are,
I mean,

1740
01:26:53,661 --> 01:26:56,000
are they going to begin with

1741
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,650
to begin with?
And the first two weeks,

1742
01:26:57,690 --> 01:27:00,740
which was the most stressful part of 
this for me,

1743
01:27:00,741 --> 01:27:02,060
I would say,
um,

1744
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:05,210
I would say the bulk of the,
of the press articles were,

1745
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,020
were,
um,

1746
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:11,630
ran contrary to my views and their basic
theme was something like,

1747
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,180
why doesn't the mean professor just play
Nice?

1748
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,100
It was something like that.
But,

1749
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:21,550
but luckily,
fortunately I seem to maneuver past 

1750
01:27:21,921 --> 01:27:25,520
that.
And then people started to actually read

1751
01:27:25,521 --> 01:27:26,580
the,
uh,

1752
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:30,920
the policies that I was speaking about 
and started to think about them.

1753
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:36,170
And one thing about the press is that 
they're actually fairly in favor of free

1754
01:27:36,171 --> 01:27:40,340
expression given that that's their 
absolute bread and butter.

1755
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:42,310
And so the,
the,

1756
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:47,560
the tenor shifted and I would say the 
overwhelming majority of press articles 

1757
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,820
in the La sueur apart from the first two
weeks have been,

1758
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,990
have been positive.
Well,

1759
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:53,360
that's great.
The

1760
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:57,510
what you've done in your youtube videos,
which I think is an amazing forum,

1761
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:02,780
particularly for what you're doing,
is document and describe in great detail

1762
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:07,911
the issues with every single one of 
these problems with no interruption and 

1763
01:28:08,161 --> 01:28:09,870
I think that's one of the best things 
about it.

1764
01:28:09,871 --> 01:28:14,871
The fact that there's not really a whole
lot of forums that will give you the 

1765
01:28:14,871 --> 01:28:18,441
chance to express yourself.
I've seen some of your videos have 

1766
01:28:18,441 --> 01:28:20,601
hundreds of thousands of views and 
there's not a whole lot of forums where 

1767
01:28:20,601 --> 01:28:23,190
you can do that and speak for A.
I mean they're all like an hour long.

1768
01:28:23,191 --> 01:28:23,850
Right?
I know,

1769
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:24,580
I know.
I mean it's.

1770
01:28:24,581 --> 01:28:25,380
It's amazing.

1771
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,750
It's amazing.
Youtube is.

1772
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:28,140
Youtube is.
Well,

1773
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:29,610
I started,
I posted,

1774
01:28:29,611 --> 01:28:34,611
started posting my lectures on Youtube,
my classroom lectures in 2013 and in 

1775
01:28:34,611 --> 01:28:39,081
really bare bones form.
They're just an ipad recording of me 

1776
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:42,471
lecturing.
I didn't edit in the slides of the 

1777
01:28:42,471 --> 01:28:42,600
images partly because that's very time 
consuming,

1778
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:48,170
but then I watched it for about two 
years and by September of this year it 

1779
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:50,460
declined to about a million views.
And then I really started thinking about

1780
01:28:50,461 --> 01:28:52,860
youtube because youtube was cute cat 
videos,

1781
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:57,861
you know,
Justin bieber songs for a very long 

1782
01:28:57,861 --> 01:28:59,961
period of time,
but it's not that anymore and that's 

1783
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:01,230
probably been about two years or maybe 
two and a half years.

1784
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:05,130
But then I realized that Youtube is 
actually a revolution that's as,

1785
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:08,760
as overwhelming as the Gutenberg press 
revolution.

1786
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:13,761
Gutenberg invented the printing press 
and because for the first time in human 

1787
01:29:13,761 --> 01:29:18,291
history,
a lecture can have the same reach and 

1788
01:29:18,291 --> 01:29:22,290
the same longevity as a book and it's a 
lot easier for people to listen and that

1789
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,170
the time lag publication is basically 
zero,

1790
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:25,680
right?

1791
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:30,800
I mean because you can do it live I 
guess as we are right now or you can 

1792
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,470
post it in a day or two after publishing
it and,

1793
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:35,010
and you have access to this insanely 
large audience.

1794
01:29:35,011 --> 01:29:40,011
And the other thing that's really 
interesting about youtube with regards 

1795
01:29:40,011 --> 01:29:40,380
to my,
especially the more academic videos,

1796
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:42,510
is there's only one reason that people 
are watching them.

1797
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:45,300
One,
it's not the production quality.

1798
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:47,520
The audio is okay and I'm a good 
speaker,

1799
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:52,521
but it's not the production quality.
The reason they're watching them is 

1800
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:55,551
because they want to know and that's 
something that's really cool about 

1801
01:29:55,551 --> 01:29:58,881
youtube and youtube also seems to be 
quite skeptical about advanced 

1802
01:29:58,881 --> 01:29:59,070
production values.
You know,

1803
01:29:59,071 --> 01:30:04,071
the people who are,
who are popular are often people like 

1804
01:30:04,071 --> 01:30:07,010
you who are basically sitting there 
talking and everyone's listening.

1805
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:07,440
It's like,
oh,

1806
01:30:07,441 --> 01:30:12,441
well people are actually talking about 
something and this turns out to be 

1807
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:15,621
interesting.
It's like the rebirth of genuine 

1808
01:30:15,621 --> 01:30:15,621
journalism.
So yeah,

1809
01:30:15,621 --> 01:30:18,210
youtube is a,
God only knows what youtube is,

1810
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:18,840
but.

1811
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,720
Well,
I think it's international revolution.

1812
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:25,750
I believe you're right.
And I think the Internet in general is 

1813
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,720
this really new thing in terms of the 
ability to express yourself.

1814
01:30:28,761 --> 01:30:33,320
I mean it's only existed for 20 plus 
years and in terms of human history,

1815
01:30:33,321 --> 01:30:36,820
that's a blink of an eye and it's only 
really been used as you,

1816
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:40,250
you've described over the last couple of
years in this form.

1817
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,020
And I think,
uh,

1818
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:47,290
it also is responsible,
I think for a great deal of the rise of 

1819
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:48,420
the popularity of the social justice 
movement.

1820
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:53,450
I think it's a double edge sword.
I think these echo chambers and these 

1821
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:56,621
people that do find these patterns of 
behavior that they subscribe to,

1822
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:02,620
and I think that is part of the problem 
with ideologies in general is that 

1823
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:05,300
instead of thinking for yourself,
you subscribe to a predetermined pattern

1824
01:31:05,301 --> 01:31:09,380
or behavior and you will lock in like,
this is what I'm supposed to believe.

1825
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:14,060
This is what I'm supposed to enforce.
This is what I'm supposed to side with,

1826
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:19,240
and you go with that.
One of the good things about the 

1827
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,451
internet is that it is potentially 
possible to see contrary viewpoints and 

1828
01:31:24,021 --> 01:31:29,021
analyze them in the comfort of your own 
home and being by yourself and and 

1829
01:31:29,021 --> 01:31:31,370
looking at maybe one of your videos and 
maybe someone come to you and I'm sure a

1830
01:31:31,371 --> 01:31:34,910
lot have come to your videos in anger,
mad at you,

1831
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:40,090
and then listen to your points of view 
and listen to how clearly you've 

1832
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:42,820
established all of these positions and 
what what you actually feel is the 

1833
01:31:43,161 --> 01:31:45,230
problem with these positions.
In a very,

1834
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:49,550
very calm and very rational and a very 
well educated point of view.

1835
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:54,910
I think the these people,
they have the potential to be at least 

1836
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:56,270
informed it because you're the.

1837
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,920
I've had lots of,
I've had lots of letters maybe,

1838
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:01,060
I don't know,
2,500

1839
01:32:01,061 --> 01:32:06,061
letters maybe to my,
to my email accounts now about this and 

1840
01:32:06,061 --> 01:32:08,980
a very large number of them,
maybe maybe 200 letters,

1841
01:32:08,981 --> 01:32:13,981
150 to 200 have been from people on the 
radical left who've written to me and 

1842
01:32:13,981 --> 01:32:17,620
said that they can no longer speak 
because the authoritarian types,

1843
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:22,621
the PC authoritarians have got.
So controlling that there once 

1844
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:26,240
fashionable position is now been deemed 
unacceptable and they,

1845
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:28,120
they're alienated and it excluded.
I mean,

1846
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:30,550
you see that happening with feminists 
like Jermaine greer.

1847
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:34,690
I mean Jermaine greer who's been banned 
from campuses,

1848
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:39,880
um,
she's not very happy with the idea that 

1849
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:40,540
being a woman is something that's been 
reduced to a whim,

1850
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:46,050
right?
Because she thinks that there's more to 

1851
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:46,050
being a woman than mirror subjective 
choice.

1852
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:48,130
While that's no longer a tenable 
viewpoint on the left.

1853
01:32:48,131 --> 01:32:50,590
And so people who hold that view point,
many of them are feminists,

1854
01:32:50,591 --> 01:32:55,300
are no longer getting along with the say
radical gender bender,

1855
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:58,570
activist types who've who've got center 
stage at the moment.

1856
01:32:59,200 --> 01:32:59,590
So

1857
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:04,730
yeah,
Christine Summers has the same issue 

1858
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:07,401
with that.
She's a feminist and she calls herself 

1859
01:33:07,401 --> 01:33:10,041
the factual feminist and she pushes back
against and what her perspective is is 

1860
01:33:10,041 --> 01:33:14,661
instead of embracing these false 
narratives and running with them as if 

1861
01:33:14,661 --> 01:33:18,240
they're the facts and and and just using
that to reinforce your ideology.

1862
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:20,940
She saying that does feminism a 
disservice?

1863
01:33:20,941 --> 01:33:25,941
Let's look at the actual reality of the 
situation and let's look at it from a 

1864
01:33:25,941 --> 01:33:30,060
balanced and objective perspective and 
she gets so much hate for them.

1865
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,430
The idea of being rational and 
objective.

1866
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:37,510
Well that that's because as far as the 
postmodern social justice warriors are 

1867
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:41,321
concerned,
those are just code words for 

1868
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:41,321
oppression.
There's no object.

1869
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:43,040
You've got to remember this with regards
to having these sorts of arguments.

1870
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:48,580
When you say objective and rational,
that's predicated on your implicit 

1871
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:53,531
belief that there is such a thing as the
objective and there is such a thing as 

1872
01:33:53,531 --> 01:33:54,980
rational.
And the radical postmodernists,

1873
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:57,590
they do not buy that.
Not at all,

1874
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,080
not at all.
As far as they're concerned.

1875
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:02,240
That's just another power game on your 
part.

1876
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:06,680
And Bill built into the laws like bill 
[inaudible] in Canada now in the same,

1877
01:34:06,681 --> 01:34:11,681
in the laws in New York City that 
governed the use of these gender 

1878
01:34:11,681 --> 01:34:14,381
pronouns built into the law is the idea 
that there's no biological a foundation 

1879
01:34:16,161 --> 01:34:19,190
for your identity and that it's all 
purely subjective.

1880
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:22,880
They built that into the law,
no objective reality,

1881
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:26,990
no biology that's going to unfold over 
the next 20 years

1882
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:29,200
or not.
I mean,

1883
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:34,220
isn't it,
isn't it possible that these kinds of 

1884
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,611
discussions and that your videos and 
then all the people that agree and all 

1885
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:40,031
the people that are pushing back against
this can have some sort of an effect on 

1886
01:34:40,031 --> 01:34:40,031
this movement

1887
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,640
I think?
Or do you think to say yes?

1888
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,670
I mean,
are you cynical about the future?

1889
01:34:45,671 --> 01:34:46,360
No,
no,

1890
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:48,970
no.
I'm not at all cynical about the future.

1891
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,550
I am cynical about my ability to predict
the future.

1892
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,110
Like when I was younger,
much younger back in the 19 eighties.

1893
01:34:56,111 --> 01:34:57,010
I mean,
I was very,

1894
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,540
very concerned about the possibility of 
nuclear war,

1895
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,610
but by a,
by yes,

1896
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:02,630
as we all were.
Yes.

1897
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,850
By bought about,
by about the mid nineties though,

1898
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:09,851
I realized that things were in such a 
state of chaotic flux that the one thing

1899
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:14,690
I can be certain of was that no matter 
what I was afraid of with regards to the

1900
01:35:14,691 --> 01:35:19,691
future,
that isn't what was going to happen and 

1901
01:35:19,691 --> 01:35:22,631
so I'm not cynical about the future,
but I do believe that we're in an 

1902
01:35:22,631 --> 01:35:25,871
unprecedented state of indeterminate 
indeterminacy and flux and God only 

1903
01:35:27,531 --> 01:35:28,580
knows what could happen.

1904
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:34,360
I'm not having said that.
I wouldn't say I'm optimistic about the 

1905
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:37,130
possibility that the universities will 
reform themselves because I think that.

1906
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,520
Well,
even with the free speech debate that 

1907
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,590
that the University of Toronto hosted,
they did three politically correct 

1908
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:45,940
things during the debate,
which,

1909
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:50,970
which I thought was really interesting 
because if I would have staged a debate 

1910
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:52,760
and been working on their side,
let's say,

1911
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,370
I would have said strategically 
speaking,

1912
01:35:56,030 --> 01:36:01,030
no politically correct maneuvering 
during this debate because all it's 

1913
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,000
gonna do is discredit us,
but that isn't what happened.

1914
01:36:02,001 --> 01:36:07,001
The university opened up by noting that 
the land on which we were having the 

1915
01:36:07,001 --> 01:36:11,441
debate was once the.
What was one's property owned by the 

1916
01:36:11,441 --> 01:36:14,891
original native set native Americans,
which is something I find it boring 

1917
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:19,960
because on the one hand we took it and 
now on the other hand we want to be 

1918
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,170
friends.
It's like that's.

1919
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:25,370
I don't think you get to have both sides
of that moral play at the same time,

1920
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:30,550
but that's okay.
That's how the university opened the 

1921
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:32,501
debate and then the next thing that 
happened was that they announced that 

1922
01:36:32,501 --> 01:36:35,681
there would be counselors waiting 
outside for anybody who was too 

1923
01:36:35,681 --> 01:36:37,340
traumatized by the contents of the 
discussion and then they closed.

1924
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:41,270
They closed by announcing the Trans Day 
of remembrance,

1925
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:42,390
you know,
and but,

1926
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,810
and the reason I'm pointing this out is 
because it,

1927
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:47,630
it just shows you the fact that those 
things happened.

1928
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:53,410
They weren't even strategic.
That's just how things are at the 

1929
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:56,651
university and they didn't even notice 
that people were going to turn 

1930
01:36:56,651 --> 01:36:57,620
themselves inside out.
Noticing that saying,

1931
01:36:57,621 --> 01:36:58,970
well God,
this is so biased.

1932
01:36:58,971 --> 01:37:01,100
I can hardly believe it,
which is exactly what happened.

1933
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:06,400
That's how saturated the universities 
are with this kind of thinking and I 

1934
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:10,151
don't have any idea what can reverse 
that collective decisions on the part of

1935
01:37:10,611 --> 01:37:14,870
citizens a to stop sending their 
children there be to stop donating money

1936
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:19,871
and leaving it in wills and see to 
pressure politicians like in my wilder 

1937
01:37:19,871 --> 01:37:24,351
moments,
I think cut the funding to the 

1938
01:37:24,351 --> 01:37:26,441
universities by 25 percent and let the 
faculty have a war about what's 

1939
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:30,410
important and maybe what would be 
leftover with what the university should

1940
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:30,740
be.

1941
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:36,080
But I really think it's,
with the exception of the science,

1942
01:37:36,081 --> 01:37:41,081
technology,
engineering and mathematics ends of 

1943
01:37:41,081 --> 01:37:41,081
things.
I think it's come to that.

1944
01:37:41,081 --> 01:37:45,760
Don't you think that what you're doing 
when you're making these videos is in a 

1945
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:50,201
sense branching out a way from just a 
university and teaching online because 

1946
01:37:50,451 --> 01:37:51,410
you all,
like I said,

1947
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:56,411
I think that that you could make a case 
that that's where the university is 

1948
01:37:56,411 --> 01:37:58,380
because that's where people are going 
just to get knowledge.

1949
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:00,960
They have no other,
they have no other motivation

1950
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:06,990
and this is a new thing obviously,
but at one point in time,

1951
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:08,530
so it was the printing press,
right?

1952
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,120
And this,
this,

1953
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:14,170
this new ability to disseminate 
information seems to me to be more 

1954
01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:15,390
effective,
more accessible,

1955
01:38:15,391 --> 01:38:16,580
more reasonable.
Yeah,

1956
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:20,530
and it's entirely possible that what 
we're looking at is the future of

1957
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:21,790
kg.
It could be,

1958
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:26,880
it could be.
I mean I've just been spending a lot of 

1959
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,041
time in the last month or so also 
concentrating on video editing and so I 

1960
01:38:29,291 --> 01:38:32,670
spent about 10 hours this week video 
editing about an hour,

1961
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:36,460
a discussion with a Russian Orthodox 
icon carver.

1962
01:38:36,461 --> 01:38:40,620
Weirdly enough that I'm going to launch 
in the next three or four days and it,

1963
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,320
it,
we,

1964
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:46,370
we discussed things that,
that are very image heavy and so I've 

1965
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:50,110
been cutting in a lot of images and it 
is a technology that far supersedes what

1966
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,060
I mean.
I like lecturing and lecturing.

1967
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:57,150
Lectures can be very effective,
but basically with youtube you can turn 

1968
01:38:57,641 --> 01:39:02,641
your lecture into a documentary and then
instead of teaching 100 people you can 

1969
01:39:02,641 --> 01:39:05,320
teach 50,000.
It's like that's a lot different.

1970
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:08,290
That's a lot different and it's up there
permanently.

1971
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,670
Yes.
And that 50,000

1972
01:39:09,671 --> 01:39:14,200
can grow and grow and grow and as it 
becomes more spread and shared,

1973
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:17,740
the also the discussions about it become
more varied.

1974
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:22,860
Yup.
Well three more than 3 million people 

1975
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:24,940
have watched some element of this in the
last couple of months and in September I

1976
01:39:24,941 --> 01:39:27,910
had about 9,000
subscribers.

1977
01:39:27,911 --> 01:39:30,130
That took me about two years,
three years to build.

1978
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:33,040
And one of my ambitions,
which was kind of a tongue and cheek and

1979
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:34,890
comical ambition is I thought,
hey,

1980
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:39,930
you know,
I bet I can get more subscribers in the 

1981
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:39,930
next three years.
Then the UFT has students.

1982
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:41,500
I thought,
well that's pretty interesting,

1983
01:39:41,501 --> 01:39:44,500
is like all of a sudden I could have a 
body of students,

1984
01:39:44,501 --> 01:39:47,820
let's say that's larger than the entire 
university's like what?

1985
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:49,930
We'll just exactly what the hell does 
that mean?

1986
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:52,480
And the answer to that is,
I don't know what that means.

1987
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,960
Who knows what that means,
but one of the other perverse things 

1988
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:01,951
that happened while I was being warned 
and a cautioned by the university was 

1989
01:40:04,421 --> 01:40:08,200
that my subscriber base grew from 9,000
to $65,000.

1990
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:13,200
So now I have more youtube subscribers 
than the University of Toronto has 

1991
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:13,200
students.
It's like,

1992
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,470
so then I think,
well hell,

1993
01:40:14,471 --> 01:40:19,471
you know,
I could do a whole series on 

1994
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:20,911
Solzhenitsyn.
I could do a whole series on George 

1995
01:40:20,911 --> 01:40:23,370
Orwell.
I could do a whole series on the Aldous 

1996
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:25,170
Huxley.
I could do a whole series on archetipal 

1997
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:27,010
biblical stories and half of me thinks,
well,

1998
01:40:27,011 --> 01:40:32,011
if 50,000
people are going to watch each of those 

1999
01:40:32,011 --> 01:40:32,920
and I can turn them into documentaries 
instead of just lectures.

2000
01:40:33,550 --> 01:40:38,550
Maybe that's what I should be doing.
Like I couldn't write a book with that 

2001
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:38,920
much reach.
That's crazy.

2002
01:40:38,921 --> 01:40:40,630
Reach crazy.
Yeah,

2003
01:40:40,631 --> 01:40:41,140
it's,
it's,

2004
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:43,960
it's,
it's revolutionary.

2005
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:46,150
I believe that.
I believe it's revolutionary.

2006
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:48,550
I believe it is too.
And I believe no one saw it coming and I

2007
01:40:48,551 --> 01:40:53,551
think it's such a new thing that we're 
all just sort of starting to get a 

2008
01:40:53,551 --> 01:40:54,010
handle on how to it and what it's

2009
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,890
capable of.
Yes.

2010
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:57,100
Well it was like the Internet was for 
pornography.

2011
01:40:57,310 --> 01:41:02,310
Well that changed quick and youtube was 
for cute cat videos and that changed 

2012
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:06,901
quick too.
You don't know what the technology is 

2013
01:41:06,901 --> 01:41:06,901
going to do.

2014
01:41:06,901 --> 01:41:10,210
Well it's also a,
I don't know how much you've paid 

2015
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:11,390
attention to virtual reality or how much
you've experimented with it,

2016
01:41:11,391 --> 01:41:16,391
but my good friend Duncan trussell has 
one of those htc vives and uh,

2017
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:20,660
I put it on over his house.
He runs a podcast and we,

2018
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:25,900
we played with it for about an hour and 
a half and then we did a podcast and I 

2019
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:28,580
am thoroughly convinced,
especially now with a new phones,

2020
01:41:28,581 --> 01:41:33,320
there's a phone that I just got called 
the Google Pixel and it comes.

2021
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:37,850
You can buy it with this headset,
you slide the phone into the headset,

2022
01:41:37,851 --> 01:41:42,851
you put on this virtual reality a 
program and you're watching a virtual 

2023
01:41:42,891 --> 01:41:47,891
reality show on your phone,
a regular phone that fits in your 

2024
01:41:47,891 --> 01:41:49,490
pocket,
just slides to the headset.

2025
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:54,820
You could do not just a two dimensional 
thing where you're showing a lecture and

2026
01:41:54,831 --> 01:41:59,831
showing images and having a discussion 
and putting these images in the 

2027
01:41:59,831 --> 01:42:03,011
background.
We're in the foreground and have the 

2028
01:42:03,011 --> 01:42:04,511
audio over it,
but rather you could have three 

2029
01:42:04,511 --> 01:42:06,320
dimensional things where you could show 
a city of village a mountain range.

2030
01:42:06,321 --> 01:42:10,700
You could show a geometric patterns you 
could get involved in.

2031
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:15,850
I mean it could be used for a million 
different things and not just for 

2032
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:18,330
entertainment but also for education and
I think that is,

2033
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,880
that's the next step I think.

2034
01:42:21,490 --> 01:42:25,210
I mean it's a.
it's an unbelievably fascinating new.

2035
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:25,960
Well,
you must be.

2036
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:30,730
Must be shocked to some degree at how 
popular your podcasts have become.

2037
01:42:30,731 --> 01:42:31,540
I mean,
you have,

2038
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,350
I don't know how many people on Youtube 
have larger subscriber base than you,

2039
01:42:35,351 --> 01:42:37,870
but it's not that many.
So I mean,

2040
01:42:37,871 --> 01:42:42,871
how.
How do you account for that and does 

2041
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:42,871
that surprise you?
It's surprising,

2042
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:46,891
but it's that this whole,
this whole podcast thing is very 

2043
01:42:46,891 --> 01:42:46,891
surprising,
but it's um,

2044
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:52,260
the youtube is only a small fraction of 
the amount of people that actually 

2045
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:55,120
listen to the podcast.
The numbers of the downloads are insane.

2046
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,710
Jamie,
what was the last month's numbers?

2047
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:01,220
Was the youtube was around 12 million 
for the month and audio is at $60.

2048
01:43:01,221 --> 01:43:02,440
Million.
Wow.

2049
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:03,570
Yeah.
I haven't done,

2050
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:07,060
like,
I haven't played vr anywhere near enough

2051
01:43:07,061 --> 01:43:09,180
with turning my online lectures into 
podcasts.

2052
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,990
He's definitely should.
You definitely should.

2053
01:43:10,991 --> 01:43:11,470
It's,
I mean,

2054
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:16,500
a lot of it you could listen to when 
you're in a car or when you're 

2055
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:16,500
exercising or that sort of thing.
Yeah.

2056
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:16,610
No,
I know.

2057
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:18,730
Glued to a screen with the podcasts.

2058
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:23,810
No,
I was doing some work around my office 

2059
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:24,420
when I was listening to one of yours,
one of one of your things on youtube and

2060
01:43:24,421 --> 01:43:29,421
I found that it was just as interesting 
if I was doing some other things around 

2061
01:43:29,421 --> 01:43:30,470
my office.
It's a very good passive,

2062
01:43:30,471 --> 01:43:33,000
like podcasts themselves are very good 
passive form of income.

2063
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,070
Yes,
absolutely entertainment that makes them

2064
01:43:35,071 --> 01:43:38,850
different than reading because reading 
is faster if you're a good reader,

2065
01:43:38,851 --> 01:43:40,920
but you can't do anything else while 
you're doing it.

2066
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:46,090
Right.
People are much more naturally attuned 

2067
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:48,411
to listening than they are to read it 
because we've only been reading really 

2068
01:43:48,411 --> 01:43:52,280
human beings have only been reading 
roughly speaking in any large numbers 

2069
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:52,430
for hundred years.
Right.

2070
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:55,520
It's a blink of the eye.
Whereas we'd been listening for a very,

2071
01:43:55,521 --> 01:44:00,521
very long period of time and all this 
new technology like puts us right back.

2072
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:03,830
It puts us back into tribal mode 
basically,

2073
01:44:03,831 --> 01:44:07,250
except with this incredible 
technological enhancement.

2074
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:12,490
It wouldn't be difficult at all to 
extract the audio from any of these 

2075
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:14,780
youtube videos and just start putting it
online as a podcast and again,

2076
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:19,781
you know,
people could listen to it when they're 

2077
01:44:19,781 --> 01:44:19,781
in traffic,
when they can't look at it.

2078
01:44:19,781 --> 01:44:21,190
Anything on planes,
I'm on the bus or wherever you are,

2079
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:26,260
where you can just sit down and you.
You can close your eyes and you don't 

2080
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,950
have to be paying attention to it 
visually.

2081
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:28,430
Yeah.
Well,

2082
01:44:28,431 --> 01:44:30,230
I,
about four or five months ago,

2083
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I emailed the university,
the University of Toronto because they 

2084
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,730
have a kind of a massive online course 
branch,

2085
01:44:37,731 --> 01:44:40,370
which they're toying with and I said,
look,

2086
01:44:40,371 --> 01:44:42,740
I've got a million people who've watched
my videos,

2087
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:44,420
like maybe you guys should give me a 
hand.

2088
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:49,810
We should do something about this 
because I got a million people who are 

2089
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:50,570
watching these videos.
It's like that's,

2090
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,060
that's a significant number of people.
It's worth attending to,

2091
01:44:53,061 --> 01:44:57,140
but perhaps I contacted the wrong people
but I never did get a response,

2092
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:02,560
but it's something I'm.
While I'm doing it actively right now 

2093
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:03,620
and I think the quality of my videos has
improved substantially in the last month

2094
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:05,690
and I really liked doing the video 
editing.

2095
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:10,690
Although it's very painstaking,
but it's definitely the universities 

2096
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:15,670
better be careful because they're 
dumping their content online as fast as 

2097
01:45:15,670 --> 01:45:18,701
they can.
They're going to make themselves 

2098
01:45:18,701 --> 01:45:18,701
completely superfluous and some smart 
person.

2099
01:45:18,701 --> 01:45:23,350
I've been thinking about this for 20 
years is going to take over the 

2100
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:25,751
accreditation end because you know all 
you'd have to do is set up a series of 

2101
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:31,490
well designed examinations online and 
only let a minority of people pass.

2102
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:34,280
You have instant accreditation 
credibility.

2103
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:39,520
It's like here's an entire three years 
worth of psychology courses.

2104
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:42,300
Here's the exams.
You take them.

2105
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:45,980
Only 15 percent of the people pass.
Why only 15 percent.

2106
01:45:45,981 --> 01:45:49,670
Why would you limit the number because 
it makes the accreditation valuable,

2107
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:55,150
but you would limit the number based on 
what if you had a much larger group than

2108
01:45:55,221 --> 01:45:59,770
15 percent that were effectively 
absorbing the information that you did?

2109
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:00,620
Well,
fair enough.

2110
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:02,370
You'd have to.
You'd have to toy with a.

2111
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:04,940
you'd have to toy with the accreditation
mechanisms,

2112
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:10,270
but I mean part of part of the utility 
and the accreditation is that it's 

2113
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:14,710
inequality.
If everyone gets accredited then the 

2114
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:17,951
accreditation is worth noting.
They just make it difficult because 

2115
01:46:17,951 --> 01:46:17,951
that's what you do is make a difficult.
Yeah,

2116
01:46:17,951 --> 01:46:19,220
but I mean instead of limiting 
difficulty.

2117
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:24,840
Okay,
so you wouldn't necessarily be limiting 

2118
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:24,840
the number.
You would just make it so difficult that

2119
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,890
the number would be limited,
almost match.

2120
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:26,510
That's right.
Well,

2121
01:46:26,511 --> 01:46:28,610
I think I'd probably make it.
I'd probably live.

2122
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,930
Yes,
that's exactly right.

2123
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:33,680
I wouldn't limit the number of times 
people could take the exams.

2124
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:39,290
That's a great idea as well.
So as long as you hit threshold,

2125
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:41,540
I mean that's what happens often.
Say with,

2126
01:46:41,570 --> 01:46:46,570
with uh,
like if you're trying to trying to pass 

2127
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:46,910
the bar or something like that,
you get to take it a number of times,

2128
01:46:46,911 --> 01:46:48,920
but you have to,
you have to hit threshold.

2129
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:50,310
Well,
Thaddeus Russell,

2130
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:52,440
who,
who's a history professor at Occidental,

2131
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:53,660
he,
um,

2132
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:58,850
he's doing that very same thing.
He talked about it here that he's 

2133
01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:01,790
building right now,
an online university and he is planning 

2134
01:47:02,221 --> 01:47:07,221
on giving out degrees in history through
his online university because he's been 

2135
01:47:07,221 --> 01:47:11,061
teaching at universities for a long time
and he has a huge problem also with the 

2136
01:47:11,521 --> 01:47:15,200
politically correct movement.
And he was speaking out against a,

2137
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:18,960
this really crazy story where these two 
kids,

2138
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:23,790
uh,
adults got intoxicated and had sex.

2139
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:27,210
And because they were both intoxicated 
for some reason,

2140
01:47:27,211 --> 01:47:32,211
the boy was described as the attacker 
and was a,

2141
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:38,340
he was being accused of sexual assault 
and even though it was consensual,

2142
01:47:38,341 --> 01:47:40,140
completely consensual,
even though they were both,

2143
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:42,720
not only did she send him,
she sent him texts saying,

2144
01:47:42,721 --> 01:47:44,250
do you have condoms?
Come on over,

2145
01:47:44,251 --> 01:47:46,590
we're going to do this.
But he,

2146
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:50,190
because they were intoxicated,
he was the one that was the rapist,

2147
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,420
which is insane.

2148
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:53,650
It's sexist.
It's 100 percent sexist though,

2149
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,400
that that kid is suing,
you know,

2150
01:47:55,401 --> 01:47:57,330
and that ace Russell came on here and 
discussed it,

2151
01:47:57,331 --> 01:48:02,331
but that politically correct ideology 
where it's,

2152
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:06,930
it's essentially it's prejudice against 
men in that particular theory.

2153
01:48:06,970 --> 01:48:09,420
The idea that he's stepping outside of 
the university.

2154
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:14,460
I slowly moved.
It means God gets sod is doing that 

2155
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:14,470
exactly it to yes.
And you know,

2156
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:17,820
he gets 100,000
people watching is v each video.

2157
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:19,170
Yeah.
He's been out here a few times.

2158
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,210
I love that guy.
And again,

2159
01:48:21,211 --> 01:48:26,211
he's another one who like yourself,
has stuck his neck out and spoke out 

2160
01:48:26,211 --> 01:48:30,501
about what he thinks is this 
preposterous movement towards denying 

2161
01:48:30,501 --> 01:48:34,881
facts,
denying reality and forming these 

2162
01:48:34,881 --> 01:48:35,830
narratives that are based on their 
ideologies and,

2163
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:41,050
and sticking within this box and then 
seeking to find people that agree with 

2164
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:43,500
it and then reinforcing these ideas in 
this echo chamber.

2165
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:48,500
And it's just,
it's for someone who's outside of it 

2166
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:51,921
like myself.
It's a fascinating thing to watch for 

2167
01:48:51,921 --> 01:48:51,921
someone who's inside of it like 
yourself,

2168
01:48:51,921 --> 01:48:53,040
it must be maddening.
Well,

2169
01:48:53,041 --> 01:48:58,041
we've tried to.
We've tried other online interventions 

2170
01:48:58,041 --> 01:48:58,041
too,
so I have these youtube videos up,

2171
01:48:58,041 --> 01:49:02,961
but we also designed.
I work with some corporations a while 

2172
01:49:02,961 --> 01:49:07,041
back because I've done some consulting 
and I had designed tests to help people 

2173
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:09,180
hire better employees,
which I still do.

2174
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:11,330
And in fact I worked with his company up
in,

2175
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:16,400
in California called the founder 
institute and it's the world's largest 

2176
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,010
stage early technology company 
incubator.

2177
01:49:17,011 --> 01:49:22,011
It's created 2,500
companies in the last four years and we 

2178
01:49:22,011 --> 01:49:25,551
test now in 135 cities.
But when I was marketing these tests to 

2179
01:49:26,191 --> 01:49:31,191
companies,
they kept asking me what could be done 

2180
01:49:31,191 --> 01:49:31,320
about their poorer performing employees,
and I said,

2181
01:49:31,321 --> 01:49:33,900
well,
I didn't know because it's not that easy

2182
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:36,390
to.
If you have someone who's problematic,

2183
01:49:36,391 --> 01:49:41,391
who's troubled,
it's not that easy for a manager to 

2184
01:49:41,391 --> 01:49:42,240
figure out how to straighten them out 
and they just don't have the time.

2185
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:44,420
They don't have the time,
they don't have the manpower,

2186
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:46,290
they don't have the training usually to 
do that.

2187
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:48,460
But I designed this set of programs

2188
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:51,340
called the self authoring suite,
and one of them,

2189
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:55,210
the future authoring program helps 
people write out a plan for their life.

2190
01:49:55,211 --> 01:50:00,211
So it helps them to ask you some 
questions about six dimensions of your 

2191
01:50:00,211 --> 01:50:00,211
life.
You know,

2192
01:50:00,211 --> 01:50:01,180
your,
your health,

2193
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:03,700
mental and physical,
your use of drugs and alcohol,

2194
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:07,600
your wishes three to five years down the
road for intimate relationships,

2195
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:08,830
for family,
for career,

2196
01:50:08,831 --> 01:50:11,140
for education and so on.
It asks you,

2197
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,200
what could your life be like three to 
five years down the road?

2198
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:19,440
If you set it up for you,
like you were someone you were taking 

2199
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:19,720
care of.
So it asks you those six questions,

2200
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:25,500
then it asks you to write for 15 minutes
about about your vision for your life.

2201
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:28,210
You get to have what you want and what 
would be good for you,

2202
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:33,480
what would that be?
And then it asks you to write for 15 

2203
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:35,050
minutes about what your life would be 
like three to five years down the road.

2204
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:37,110
If you let your bad habits and you're,
you know,

2205
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:39,760
idiocies in your foolishness is in your 
weaknesses.

2206
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:44,790
Take the upper hand in,
Auger you into the ground because 

2207
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:47,071
everyone knows about that.
And so it's like you get to design a 

2208
01:50:47,071 --> 01:50:49,870
little heaven to strive for and little 
hell to avoid and then you write for.

2209
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,810
Then you basically turn that into an 
implementable plan.

2210
01:50:52,811 --> 01:50:56,560
That's the second part of the program.
We've used that with about 5,005

2211
01:50:56,561 --> 01:50:59,710
to 7,000
university students now mostly in Europe

2212
01:50:59,711 --> 01:51:04,711
at the Rotterdam School of management.
And we've raised their grade point 

2213
01:51:04,711 --> 01:51:08,521
average of their kids.
Twenty five percent drop their dropout 

2214
01:51:08,521 --> 01:51:11,311
rate the same and it's had a walloping 
effect on men and on non Western ethnic 

2215
01:51:11,651 --> 01:51:16,651
minorities,
it's moved the Non Western ethnic 

2216
01:51:16,651 --> 01:51:19,381
minority student population performance 
at Rotterdam,

2217
01:51:19,601 --> 01:51:22,090
School of Management from 70 percent 
below the,

2218
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:26,210
the average to above the female Dutch,
uh,

2219
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:28,960
natives.
And so the other,

2220
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:34,020
the reason I'm telling you this in part 
from the fact that it's a very good 

2221
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:34,020
program,
and um,

2222
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:38,790
we did it at Mohawk college in Canada a 
year ago and we dropped their dropout 

2223
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:43,111
rate in the first semester,
50 percent and that especially again 

2224
01:51:43,111 --> 01:51:44,270
worked well for men because men are at 
more risk of dropping out now and,

2225
01:51:44,271 --> 01:51:49,271
and,
and especially for men who didn't have 

2226
01:51:49,271 --> 01:51:49,271
good grades in high school.

2227
01:51:49,271 --> 01:51:52,620
So not only is there the possibility for
the net to provide tremendous 

2228
01:51:53,441 --> 01:51:57,040
dissemination of intellectual material,
but there's also the possibility for the

2229
01:51:57,041 --> 01:52:02,041
net to provide dissemination of 
psychological interventions that have 

2230
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:07,290
major impacts on people's mental health 
and productivity at almost at 

2231
01:52:07,290 --> 01:52:09,670
extraordinarily low cost.
So that's really been fun too.

2232
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:14,290
So I think providing some that sort of a
structure and a framework,

2233
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:18,670
giving people the tools just inform of 
asking them questions.

2234
01:52:18,671 --> 01:52:21,400
What would you like to do is describe 
this,

2235
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:26,670
what is your view and when you do that,
you sort of allow them to help 

2236
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:28,510
themselves outline what they would like 
to accomplish,

2237
01:52:28,511 --> 01:52:31,660
which most people don't do well in our 
education system,

2238
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:37,050
our education system was designed in 
Chicago in the late 18 hundreds to 

2239
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:41,161
produce factory workers because it was 
set up when when rural people were 

2240
01:52:41,261 --> 01:52:43,720
migrating to the cities on mass because 
their kids,

2241
01:52:43,721 --> 01:52:48,721
first of all,
we're likely to get factory jobs and 

2242
01:52:48,721 --> 01:52:48,721
second of all,
if you were working in factory,

2243
01:52:48,721 --> 01:52:52,601
your kids needed to be taken care of and
so the purpose of the schools was to 

2244
01:52:52,601 --> 01:52:54,900
train factory workers,
which is why everyone's lined up enrolls

2245
01:52:55,110 --> 01:52:56,840
rose and why there are bells.

2246
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:01,840
It's a factory model.
The problem with that is that now 

2247
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:02,660
people's careers basically have to be 
self determined,

2248
01:53:02,661 --> 01:53:07,661
but that's never.
That's never part of the education 

2249
01:53:07,661 --> 01:53:10,091
system.
Part of the reason I developed these 

2250
01:53:10,091 --> 01:53:12,041
programs was because I realized this is 
the same course where I'm teaching 

2251
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:14,090
students that if they would have been in
Germany in the 19 thirties,

2252
01:53:14,091 --> 01:53:19,091
they would have be Nazis.
I'm trying to get them to design their 

2253
01:53:19,091 --> 01:53:22,811
lives and it's way better to have 
someone articulate their own plan.

2254
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:29,380
You actually neurologically rewire 
people by having them formulate their 

2255
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:33,551
own thoughts,
which is why you know your school 

2256
01:53:33,551 --> 01:53:33,551
teachers used to say,
put it in your own words.

2257
01:53:33,551 --> 01:53:35,750
It's actually very good advice.
If they would explain what that means.

2258
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:40,780
It's like if you have to conjure up the 
thoughts and you have to articulate 

2259
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:43,700
them,
then they change you and so well,

2260
01:53:43,701 --> 01:53:47,440
and so this program has had the,
the,

2261
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:52,600
the,
the effects have been absolutely 

2262
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:52,670
overwhelming for us as researchers 
because it's very,

2263
01:53:52,671 --> 01:53:57,671
very difficult to produce an 
intervention that actually has a 

2264
01:53:57,671 --> 01:53:58,760
positive effect on people you know,
you hope it does,

2265
01:53:58,761 --> 01:54:00,460
but generally when you test it out,
it's like,

2266
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:02,690
no,
it doesn't do what you thought it did.

2267
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:04,520
Or sometimes it even has the reverse 
effect.

2268
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:05,840
That sounds fascinating.
Now,

2269
01:54:05,841 --> 01:54:07,880
how do people have had,
can someone,

2270
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:11,870
a regular person have access to this?
It's called self authoring.

2271
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,000
So that's e l,
f authoring,

2272
01:54:14,001 --> 01:54:15,230
like,
like writing a book,

2273
01:54:15,231 --> 01:54:19,970
self authoring Dotcom and the programs I
gave away the future authoring program.

2274
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,300
I think it might still be free.
Um,

2275
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:23,540
it was,
yeah,

2276
01:54:23,541 --> 01:54:27,530
it is until the end of November I did a 
video called message to millennials were

2277
01:54:27,950 --> 01:54:30,770
because one of the things Jonathan Heit 
said about,

2278
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:33,440
uh,
he called Karl Marx,

2279
01:54:33,441 --> 01:54:37,700
the patron saint of the social justice 
warriors and John Stuart Mill,

2280
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:41,210
that patron saint of people say who 
stood for objective truth and freedom of

2281
01:54:41,211 --> 01:54:43,490
expression.
And I thought that was really smart.

2282
01:54:43,491 --> 01:54:48,491
He said Brown university is number one 
for social justice warrior universities 

2283
01:54:48,491 --> 01:54:52,841
in Chicago for Truth Universities.
But one of the things that marks has 

2284
01:54:53,091 --> 01:54:58,091
over John Stuart mill is that mark's is 
a social revolutionary and young people 

2285
01:54:58,091 --> 01:54:59,570
like to think about ways to change the 
world.

2286
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:04,630
Right?
And that's actually a positive part of 

2287
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:06,371
their development.
It's a stage that the developmental 

2288
01:55:06,371 --> 01:55:08,981
psychologist,
Sean Piaget called the messianic stage 

2289
01:55:08,981 --> 01:55:08,981
and he associated that with late 
adolescents.

2290
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:11,450
So like while young people want to 
change the world,

2291
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:16,540
the problem is,
is that that's been harnessed into 

2292
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:18,080
attempts to change other people,
but that isn't what you should do if you

2293
01:55:18,081 --> 01:55:19,970
want to change the world,
you should change yourself.

2294
01:55:19,971 --> 01:55:21,950
And I don't mean that in some cliched 
sense.

2295
01:55:21,951 --> 01:55:26,951
I mean it in the sense that Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn said when he analyzed the 

2296
01:55:26,951 --> 01:55:27,110
Soviet Union,
he said,

2297
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:32,590
don't be thinking that the line that 
divides good from evil runs down 

2298
01:55:32,590 --> 01:55:33,730
political spectrum or,
or,

2299
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:38,790
or countries or something like that.
It runs down right down the middle of 

2300
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:42,641
your soul.
And if you want to sort out the world 

2301
01:55:42,641 --> 01:55:42,641
and what you do is you sort yourself 
out.

2302
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,460
It's a serious business,
right?

2303
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:47,520
They say it's more difficult to rule 
yourself than to rule a city.

2304
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:52,790
And that's the truth because you're a 
complicated and there are horrible 

2305
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:53,720
monsters inside of you that need to be 
tamed and to,

2306
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:58,740
and to be brought and to be brought into
alignment and submission so that you can

2307
01:55:58,741 --> 01:56:01,610
be a powerful and useful person.
And um,

2308
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:07,820
I gave away the future authoring program
as part of this video I made suggesting 

2309
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:12,291
to millennials that instead of rushing 
out there to change the world by 

2310
01:56:12,291 --> 01:56:15,471
changing other bad people that they 
should look inward and sort themselves 

2311
01:56:15,471 --> 01:56:19,671
out properly.
And I think we've given away about four 

2312
01:56:19,671 --> 01:56:22,731
or 5,000
of those programs so far now free till 

2313
01:56:22,731 --> 01:56:23,400
the end of November.
And then what happens with it?

2314
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:28,540
It's,
well the self or the future authoring 

2315
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:28,540
program is regularly $14,
ninety five cents.

2316
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:30,780
And the whole self authoring suite which
involves,

2317
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:33,270
it's a program that helps you write an 
autobiography.

2318
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,480
So it helps you sort out things about 
your past that are still burdening you.

2319
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:40,530
You can tell a if,
if you have a memory that's more than 18

2320
01:56:40,531 --> 01:56:45,531
months old approximately,
and when you pull that memory up to 

2321
01:56:45,531 --> 01:56:47,130
mind,
if you still have an emotional reaction,

2322
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:51,330
that means you haven't fully articulated
the memory,

2323
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:54,150
you haven't analyzed it causally,
you haven't,

2324
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:59,300
you haven't freed yourself from its 
grasp and you're carrying it like a 

2325
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:02,991
weight and your brain responds to that.
Like the more have more weight you're 

2326
01:57:02,991 --> 01:57:07,590
carrying like that more baggage.
Let's say the more of the stress Hormone

2327
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:10,290
Cortisol your brain produces and 
cortisol makes you old.

2328
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:14,460
Some of this work has been done by James
Pennebaker at the University of Texas at

2329
01:57:14,461 --> 01:57:19,461
Austin because he.
He started to pioneer these sorts of 

2330
01:57:19,461 --> 01:57:22,311
writing programs and he found that if 
people wrote about uncertain things 

2331
01:57:22,311 --> 01:57:26,960
past,
present or future so they could be 

2332
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:26,960
traumatic things,
they could be uncertain,

2333
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,560
things that their physical health 
improved and he.

2334
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:33,150
He did a lot of detailed research trying
to figure out why that was and basically

2335
01:57:33,151 --> 01:57:38,151
came down to the explanation that it was
something like an uncertainty reduction 

2336
01:57:38,161 --> 01:57:43,161
mechanism at work because your brain is 
always figuring out how well situated 

2337
01:57:43,161 --> 01:57:45,060
are you in the world.
How much do you not know compared to how

2338
01:57:45,061 --> 01:57:50,061
much have you mastered?
And you can tell that you've mastered 

2339
01:57:50,061 --> 01:57:52,090
things because when you go somewhere and
you act things turn out the way you want

2340
01:57:52,091 --> 01:57:54,360
them.
That's an indication of mastery and your

2341
01:57:54,361 --> 01:57:59,361
brain is sort of keeping track across 
your whole life of how many places 

2342
01:57:59,361 --> 01:58:00,840
you've been,
where things haven't worked out compared

2343
01:58:00,841 --> 01:58:03,330
to how many places you have been,
where they have worked out,

2344
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:07,140
and if all those places in your past 
where things haven't worked out,

2345
01:58:07,141 --> 01:58:12,141
you need to map and master and that that
decreases the existential load on you,

2346
01:58:14,521 --> 01:58:17,280
but that actually decreases your 
psychophysiological load.

2347
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,800
It makes you healthier.
It makes you less stress,

2348
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:24,120
and so we've put all that together in 
this self authoring suite to help people

2349
01:58:24,121 --> 01:58:26,670
write about their past,
to sort it out in a.

2350
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:29,240
In a detailed autobiography.
It asks you questions about your past.

2351
01:58:29,241 --> 01:58:34,241
It says,
divide your life up into six epochs and 

2352
01:58:34,241 --> 01:58:35,220
then divide each of those.
That might be,

2353
01:58:35,221 --> 01:58:35,790
say,
oh,

2354
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:40,850
birth to kindergarten and then maybe 
elementary school and then maybe junior 

2355
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:41,010
high school,
however you want to do it,

2356
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:46,290
and then to write about the emotionally 
significant events in each of those 

2357
01:58:46,290 --> 01:58:50,880
epochs and then to describe their 
effects on you and then to analyze how 

2358
01:58:51,101 --> 01:58:53,650
you did in those situations.
What you might have done differently.

2359
01:58:53,651 --> 01:58:57,070
What you might do differently in the 
future to straighten out your past,

2360
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:02,400
and I've done that with my students in 
my maps of meaning class for about the 

2361
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,920
last 10 years and some people have 
written 15,000

2362
01:59:02,921 --> 01:59:03,430
words.

2363
01:59:03,730 --> 01:59:06,460
It's not that uncommon for students to 
write 15,000

2364
01:59:06,461 --> 01:59:08,500
words and their autobiography.
Wow.

2365
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:13,560
So that's such great advice.
That's such great advice about 

2366
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,010
reconciling with your past because so 
many people just carry it around.

2367
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:15,400
Yeah.
Well,

2368
01:59:15,401 --> 01:59:17,590
if you're.
If you're thinking about your past,

2369
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:22,450
what it means is you haven't analyzed 
the causal chains because you might say,

2370
01:59:22,451 --> 01:59:24,310
well,
why do you remember your past?

2371
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:25,570
While you might say,
well,

2372
01:59:25,571 --> 01:59:27,540
it's in order to have an objective,
you know,

2373
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:32,820
record of the past.
It's like it has nothing to do with 

2374
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:32,820
that.
There's only one reason you remember the

2375
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:34,900
past and that's to be prepared for the 
future.

2376
01:59:35,530 --> 01:59:40,530
That's why you remember the past.
And so what you're supposed to do is 

2377
01:59:40,530 --> 01:59:43,890
take the past and extract out from it.
Wisdom and wisdom is the ability to 

2378
01:59:44,141 --> 01:59:48,460
avoid stumbling blindly into ditches.
And so you think,

2379
01:59:48,461 --> 01:59:50,410
well,
here's a time in my past.

2380
01:59:50,410 --> 01:59:55,410
I stumbled blindly into this horrible 
ditch and terrible things happened to 

2381
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:55,410
me.
It's like,

2382
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:56,440
okay,
you need to take that apart.

2383
01:59:56,441 --> 02:00:01,441
You need to figure out how was it that 
that events conspired with your 

2384
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:06,451
participation voluntarily or 
involuntarily so that that terrible 

2385
02:00:06,451 --> 02:00:11,400
consequences merged.
You need to know why that happened and 

2386
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:12,250
how you could react differently in that 
situation,

2387
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:15,700
and as soon as you do that,
your brain will leave it alone.

2388
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:20,910
You won't obsess you about it anymore 
because the anxiety producing parts of 

2389
02:00:20,910 --> 02:00:24,751
your brain are basically trying to tell 
you where there are obstacles in your 

2390
02:00:24,751 --> 02:00:24,751
environment.
It's like,

2391
02:00:24,751 --> 02:00:26,020
look out.
Don't go there.

2392
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:27,400
Don't go there.
It's like,

2393
02:00:27,401 --> 02:00:28,990
well,
don't go there.

2394
02:00:28,991 --> 02:00:30,610
There's fire.
Well,

2395
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:33,340
maybe you could master the fire,
right?

2396
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:38,790
Then you're a wielder of fire.
You're not just a victim and lots of 

2397
02:00:38,790 --> 02:00:42,301
situations are dangerous or not 
dangerous depending on your level of 

2398
02:00:42,301 --> 02:00:42,520
mastery,
right?

2399
02:00:42,850 --> 02:00:47,850
Life is like that,
and so a negative emotion that's 

2400
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:51,451
associated with a memory is something 
that's crying out for mastery and 

2401
02:00:51,451 --> 02:00:55,210
writing can really help with that.
So you're reorganizing your brain.

2402
02:00:55,211 --> 02:00:57,610
When you write autobiographically,
you're,

2403
02:00:57,611 --> 02:01:02,611
you're basically the emotions.
Imagine emotion memories can be stored 

2404
02:01:02,611 --> 02:01:07,561
at different levels of your brain,
some sort of primordial reptilian image 

2405
02:01:07,561 --> 02:01:12,340
laden areas that are very emotional up 
to finally articulated plans for your 

2406
02:01:13,961 --> 02:01:18,961
future life.
Will you want to take everything that's 

2407
02:01:18,961 --> 02:01:22,230
negative and emotional and transform 
that into a fully articulated vision for

2408
02:01:23,021 --> 02:01:25,570
your future and that frees you of your 
past.

2409
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:27,640
You shouldn't be thinking about your 
past.

2410
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:31,150
I mean maybe if you're 80 and you know 
you're going over a well spent life,

2411
02:01:31,151 --> 02:01:33,250
that's a whole different thing,
but if you're a 30,

2412
02:01:33,251 --> 02:01:36,550
35 or 20 and most of the time you 
thinking about your past,

2413
02:01:36,551 --> 02:01:40,760
it's like it's like your soul is trapped
back there and you need to.

2414
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:45,790
You need to free it through 
investigation and the metaphysical 

2415
02:01:45,790 --> 02:01:46,910
language is appropriate because that is 
in a sense what you're doing.

2416
02:01:46,911 --> 02:01:51,911
You're trapped in the past.
It's like you've got to break free of 

2417
02:01:51,911 --> 02:01:52,370
that so you can use all your resources 
to move ahead into the future.

2418
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:56,030
Anyways in these programs,
the future authoring program,

2419
02:01:56,031 --> 02:01:58,290
like I said,
has had walloping effects on people.

2420
02:01:58,291 --> 02:01:59,870
It's dones.
Fantastic advice to me.

2421
02:01:59,871 --> 02:02:03,050
It's just so.
It's so logical and it sounds so great.

2422
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:08,650
I mean,
I think that's one of the gigantic 

2423
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:08,900
problems that a lot of people have with 
education,

2424
02:02:08,901 --> 02:02:11,360
that you're learning facts,
you're learning information,

2425
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:14,300
but you're not learning how to use your 
own mind.

2426
02:02:14,301 --> 02:02:17,090
Now here's something that's really 
interesting about that.

2427
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:20,330
So I spent a lot of time.
I'm a scientist,

2428
02:02:20,331 --> 02:02:22,610
but I'm also.
I would say I'm also a religious person.

2429
02:02:22,611 --> 02:02:26,330
I'm a deeply religious person and how do
you reconcile those?

2430
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:27,080
Exactly.
Well,

2431
02:02:27,081 --> 02:02:28,880
that's that.
And I spent literally,

2432
02:02:28,881 --> 02:02:33,881
I've spent 40 years thinking about that 
and for 20 of those years I did almost 

2433
02:02:33,881 --> 02:02:38,771
nothing but think about that all the 
time and I realized something partly 

2434
02:02:38,771 --> 02:02:40,970
from Reading Carl young and what I 
realized was that

2435
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:47,680
even the fundamentalists have have the 
wrong idea about religious truth.

2436
02:02:48,640 --> 02:02:52,720
Religious truth is not scientific truth 
in the stories in genesis,

2437
02:02:52,721 --> 02:02:55,660
which are very old stories,
maybe tens of thousands of years old.

2438
02:02:56,170 --> 02:03:01,170
They're obviously not scientific 
theories because the people who wrote 

2439
02:03:01,170 --> 02:03:03,871
the board scientists,
we didn't have science until about 500 

2440
02:03:03,871 --> 02:03:06,541
years ago.
So the idea that the stories in genesis 

2441
02:03:06,541 --> 02:03:09,241
or scientific theories is just false on 
every possible front.

2442
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:11,140
So then you might say,
well,

2443
02:03:11,141 --> 02:03:13,030
there's no other truth,
but scientific truth.

2444
02:03:13,031 --> 02:03:13,510
It's like,
well,

2445
02:03:13,570 --> 02:03:18,570
wait a minute.
That's not true because what scientific 

2446
02:03:18,570 --> 02:03:22,831
truth tells you is what things are,
but genuine religious truth tells you 

2447
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:28,850
how you should act and those things are 
not the same.

2448
02:03:29,420 --> 02:03:33,260
And so a great story,
a great novel which is a quasi religious

2449
02:03:33,261 --> 02:03:38,261
construction because it's,
it's like a distillation of ordinary 

2450
02:03:38,261 --> 02:03:39,230
life into its most important elements.

2451
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:43,790
That's a map about how you should 
comport yourself in the world.

2452
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:46,100
And you might say,
well what do you mean by should?

2453
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:48,650
And because that's,
that's the question,

2454
02:03:48,651 --> 02:03:51,440
the moral relativist Sask.
And there's an answer to that too.

2455
02:03:51,441 --> 02:03:56,441
As far as I can tell,
and I got this partly from reading John 

2456
02:03:56,441 --> 02:03:59,320
Piaget.
So imagine that here's how you should 

2457
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:01,121
act.
You should act so that things are good 

2458
02:04:01,121 --> 02:04:05,531
for you,
like they would be for someone you're 

2459
02:04:05,531 --> 02:04:07,181
taking care of,
but they have to be good for you in a 

2460
02:04:07,181 --> 02:04:10,211
way that's also good for your family.
And they have to be good for you and 

2461
02:04:10,211 --> 02:04:13,880
your family in a way that's also good 
for society and maybe even also good for

2462
02:04:13,881 --> 02:04:18,881
the broader environment.
If you could manage that so it's 

2463
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:21,731
balanced at all those levels and then 
they that has to be good for you and 

2464
02:04:22,401 --> 02:04:27,401
your family and society and the world 
right now and next week and next month 

2465
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:32,710
and a year from now and 10 years from 
now and so it's this harmonious 

2466
02:04:32,710 --> 02:04:36,750
balancing of multiple layers of being 
simultaneously and and that's a.

2467
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,240
that's a.
that's a Darwinian reality.

2468
02:04:39,241 --> 02:04:44,241
I would say.
Your brain is actually attuned to tell 

2469
02:04:44,241 --> 02:04:46,040
you when you're doing that and the way 
it tells you is that it chew,

2470
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:48,720
it reveals that what you're doing is 
meaningful.

2471
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:53,880
That's the sign that you and your 
nervous system is adapted to do this.

2472
02:04:53,881 --> 02:04:58,881
It's adapted to exist,
I would say on the on the edge between 

2473
02:04:58,881 --> 02:05:00,870
order and chaos and chaos is where 
things are so complex.

2474
02:05:00,871 --> 02:05:05,871
You can handle it in order is where 
things are so rigid that it's too 

2475
02:05:05,871 --> 02:05:07,140
restrictive.
In between that there's a place,

2476
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:12,290
a place that's meaningful where you're 
partly stabilized and partly curious and

2477
02:05:12,301 --> 02:05:17,301
you're operating in a manner that 
increases your scope of of knowledge,

2478
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:22,730
so you're.
You're inquiring and growing and at the 

2479
02:05:22,730 --> 02:05:24,900
same time you're stabilizing and 
renewing you,

2480
02:05:24,930 --> 02:05:26,310
your family,
society,

2481
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:27,750
nature.
Now,

2482
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,940
next week,
next month and next year,

2483
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:32,160
and when you have an intimation of 
meaning,

2484
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,660
then you know you're there and I can 
give you an existential demonstration of

2485
02:05:36,661 --> 02:05:36,840
that.

2486
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:40,380
So imagine that each of these levels of 
existence,

2487
02:05:40,381 --> 02:05:44,040
the way I just laid them out or like 
patterns or patterns within patterns,

2488
02:05:44,041 --> 02:05:45,390
within patterns,
within patterns,

2489
02:05:45,391 --> 02:05:47,130
and there's a way of making all that 
harmonious.

2490
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:51,030
That's what music models.
That's why music is so meaningful.

2491
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:56,540
You know,
you take a beautiful orchestral 

2492
02:05:56,540 --> 02:05:59,001
composition and all the instruments are 
doing different things at different 

2493
02:05:59,001 --> 02:06:02,361
levels,
but they all flow together harmoniously 

2494
02:06:02,361 --> 02:06:04,521
and you're right in the middle of that 
as a listener and it fills you with a 

2495
02:06:04,521 --> 02:06:05,010
sense of.
It's almost like a sense of religious or

2496
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:07,420
even if you're a punk rock nihilist,
you know,

2497
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:13,550
and the reason for that is because the 
music is modeling the manner of being 

2498
02:06:13,550 --> 02:06:17,691
that's harmonious,
it's the proper way to exist and 

2499
02:06:17,691 --> 02:06:20,451
religious writings in the deepest sense,
so those are archetipal writings are are

2500
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:26,190
our guidelines to that mode of being so 
they're not true like scientific truth 

2501
02:06:27,151 --> 02:06:28,770
is true there.

2502
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:33,030
I think of them as hyper there 
hypertrophy or meditate true.

2503
02:06:33,570 --> 02:06:38,570
It's like we take the most true things 
about your life and then we take the 

2504
02:06:38,570 --> 02:06:42,231
most true things about 10 other people's
lives and we amalgamate them into a 

2505
02:06:42,231 --> 02:06:45,120
single figure and that would be like to.
That would be like a literary hero.

2506
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:50,890
Then we take a thousand literary heroes 
and we extract out from each of them 

2507
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:54,510
what makes the most heroic person.
That's a religious daddy.

2508
02:06:55,740 --> 02:07:00,740
That's what Christ is.
He's a metta hero and that sits at the 

2509
02:07:01,201 --> 02:07:06,201
bottom of western civilization and his 
architectural mode of being his true 

2510
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:14,420
speech.
That's the fundamental idea of western 

2511
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:14,420
civilization and it's right

2512
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:21,680
now when you say,
when you talk about this harmonious 

2513
02:07:21,690 --> 02:07:25,810
frequency that's achieved,
what?

2514
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:30,860
How do you reconcile all the stories 
that were like say in the Old Testament 

2515
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:32,550
that were extremely violent or with 
they're ridiculous.

2516
02:07:32,551 --> 02:07:33,430
Like,
Oh,

2517
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:36,490
who was the guy that they made fun of,
these children made fun of?

2518
02:07:36,491 --> 02:07:41,491
I'm so God sent a bear to kill the 
children because they made fun of him 

2519
02:07:41,491 --> 02:07:45,661
for being bald.
Or there's a bunch of stories and 

2520
02:07:45,661 --> 02:07:48,870
ridiculous tails in the Bible that 
obviously have the hand of man on them.

2521
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:54,120
How do you separate those from the 
beautiful concepts that are outlined in 

2522
02:07:55,251 --> 02:08:00,251
religion?
Like you treat everyone as if they are 

2523
02:08:00,251 --> 02:08:00,450
your brother,
you know,

2524
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:02,800
love and let love

2525
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:08,010
and that was very,
very difficult because it's all in the 

2526
02:08:08,010 --> 02:08:11,041
Old Testament.
Let's say the Old Testament was 

2527
02:08:11,041 --> 02:08:11,041
obviously written by people who were 
deeply tribal.

2528
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,480
Of course,
we're also deeply tribal and some of the

2529
02:08:13,481 --> 02:08:17,110
problems that those people were trying 
to face trying to sort out was,

2530
02:08:17,111 --> 02:08:20,560
well,
how do you organize yourself within your

2531
02:08:20,561 --> 02:08:25,561
own tribe?
Justly and mercifully and at the same 

2532
02:08:25,561 --> 02:08:29,761
time,
defend yourself against the barbarians 

2533
02:08:29,761 --> 02:08:29,761
who constitute other drives.
Well,

2534
02:08:29,761 --> 02:08:34,590
that was.
That was the problem that humanity was 

2535
02:08:34,590 --> 02:08:34,590
trying to solve when it was a mega 
meeting.

2536
02:08:34,590 --> 02:08:37,210
All of its tribes process that obviously
still hasn't,

2537
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:42,450
hasn't finished,
and some of the ways that you protect 

2538
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:47,131
your own tribe rapidly become horrifying
and so many of the stories in the Old 

2539
02:08:47,131 --> 02:08:51,031
Testament that have to do essentially 
with tribal protection are immediately 

2540
02:08:51,031 --> 02:08:51,250
horrifying,
but there's also a.

2541
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:56,580
there's a developmental pathway through 
the combination of the old and New 

2542
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:57,790
Testament that that,
that show,

2543
02:08:57,791 --> 02:09:02,791
I would say how that morality that was 
fundamentally tribal to begin with 

2544
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:08,010
transformed itself over thousands of 
years into a morality that was what that

2545
02:09:09,130 --> 02:09:14,130
transcended tribal distinctions and so 
part of the imposition of the new 

2546
02:09:14,561 --> 02:09:19,561
testament onto the old testament was the
imposition of a morality that 

2547
02:09:19,561 --> 02:09:23,281
transcended tribal morality onto a 
morality that was fundamentally tribal 

2548
02:09:23,281 --> 02:09:23,530
in origin.

2549
02:09:24,310 --> 02:09:26,190
But the new testament of course was

2550
02:09:26,810 --> 02:09:29,720
constructed by Constantine and the 
series of bishops.

2551
02:09:29,721 --> 02:09:31,150
They took things out.

2552
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:34,030
I mean how so?
Well,

2553
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,380
it's not much different.
Here's a way of thinking about it,

2554
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:41,300
so I have a friend who's a comic book 
writer and I've talked to him a fair bit

2555
02:09:41,301 --> 02:09:43,160
about archetypes in comics.
For example.

2556
02:09:43,161 --> 02:09:48,161
He was a student of mine at Harvard long
time ago and the Comic Book Universe is 

2557
02:09:48,161 --> 02:09:52,961
a very interesting one because obviously
these fictional characters were thought 

2558
02:09:52,961 --> 02:09:56,861
up by single people and then the 
fictional characters were transformed 

2559
02:09:56,861 --> 02:10:00,560
into stories and then the stories were 
sent out into a broader community.

2560
02:10:00,860 --> 02:10:05,860
But then what started to happen was the 
broader community started to stay in 

2561
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:10,361
contact with the people who are writing 
the stories and so if you do something 

2562
02:10:10,361 --> 02:10:13,540
like write Batman now,
there's a bunch of things you can't do 

2563
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:16,691
with Batman because there's been a 
collective decision made in the entire 

2564
02:10:16,691 --> 02:10:21,371
community of multiple writers and the 
entire community of multiple readers 

2565
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:26,440
that have decided that there's a core 
story that has a certain structure in 

2566
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:29,981
certain elements.
And so there's this collective process 

2567
02:10:29,981 --> 02:10:33,221
of imagination that's gone into 
constructing what you might describe as 

2568
02:10:33,221 --> 02:10:33,890
a heroic Meta narrative.
And

2569
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:39,070
the reason I'm using that as an example 
is because there isn't a lot of 

2570
02:10:39,070 --> 02:10:40,400
difference,
perversely enough in the construction,

2571
02:10:40,401 --> 02:10:44,570
say of Comic Book Heroes and the 
construction of religious deities,

2572
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:49,660
and I'm not saying that religious 
daddies or nothing but comic book 

2573
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:52,811
characters or maybe I'm elevating comic 
book characters beyond the status that 

2574
02:10:52,811 --> 02:10:54,470
they normally attained.
But if you think,

2575
02:10:54,471 --> 02:10:56,000
think about this,
for example,

2576
02:10:56,001 --> 02:11:01,001
with regards to something like the 
construction of the recent marvel 

2577
02:11:01,001 --> 02:11:03,851
universe,
I mean those avenger movies are among 

2578
02:11:03,851 --> 02:11:08,381
the most expensive technological 
artifacts that human beings have ever 

2579
02:11:08,381 --> 02:11:10,970
made and they drive our computational 
capacity to its absolute limit.

2580
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:16,270
And the reason for that is because we're
using that fictional space to lay out an

2581
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:18,620
archetypical and mythological view of 
the universe.

2582
02:11:18,621 --> 02:11:21,320
It's a practice domain for modes of 
being.

2583
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:25,870
And I mean in the Marvel Universe,
obviously Tony Stark Ironman is,

2584
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:27,770
is technological man,
right?

2585
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:32,830
He's trying to develop a real 
relationship with his partner pepper 

2586
02:11:32,830 --> 02:11:36,251
potts whose own sort of independent 
woman and he's attempting to use 

2587
02:11:36,251 --> 02:11:40,991
technology to build himself up into 
something that has the status of 

2588
02:11:40,991 --> 02:11:43,190
approximately a god to transcend more 
limitation.

2589
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:44,720
And all of that,
um,

2590
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:47,720
so there's a,
there's a daddy like aspect,

2591
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:51,410
the growth of a deity emerging there,
and then of course thor and Loki,

2592
02:11:51,411 --> 02:11:55,390
or they're not comic book ease at all.
Their actual daddy's there,

2593
02:11:55,470 --> 02:11:57,680
the hostile brothers.
It's an archetypal,

2594
02:11:58,160 --> 02:12:03,160
it's an archetype will pair like Christ 
and Satan or Batman and the joker or 

2595
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:06,880
superman and Lex luthor.
And that's the good part of the 

2596
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:07,430
individual against the evil part of the 
individual,

2597
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:10,220
roughly speaking,
that's played out in these myths.

2598
02:12:10,221 --> 02:12:15,221
And so that collective process that you 
described whereby an entire group of 

2599
02:12:15,591 --> 02:12:19,370
people comes together to decide what the
central religious text is.

2600
02:12:19,371 --> 02:12:21,590
I mean,
on the one hand you can think of that as

2601
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:24,560
the gerrymandering of a religious 
process.

2602
02:12:24,590 --> 02:12:29,590
Maybe that's something that's only 
devoted towards the acquisition of 

2603
02:12:29,590 --> 02:12:29,750
power.
Like that would be a Marxist analysis.

2604
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:35,200
But on the other hand,
you can think of it as the collective 

2605
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,200
imagination.

2606
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:37,680
Attempting to build a dramatic,
uh,

2607
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:43,390
to build,
to build a and exemplary drama that 

2608
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:44,480
everyone can act out.
And it's,

2609
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:49,510
it's enacting that exemplary drama that 
we're actually able to interact in a 

2610
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:54,880
civilized and productive manner.
Like look at this discussion that we're 

2611
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:55,100
having to,
to the degree that it's working,

2612
02:12:56,270 --> 02:13:01,270
we're both trying to articulate our 
notions of reality and I do that and you

2613
02:13:03,231 --> 02:13:08,231
listen and maybe you have some comments 
and then you do that and I listened and 

2614
02:13:08,231 --> 02:13:11,531
maybe you have some comments,
but together we're building something 

2615
02:13:11,531 --> 02:13:12,020
that's different from what we both came 
in here with.

2616
02:13:12,050 --> 02:13:14,480
Right,
and in a sense what we're doing is we're

2617
02:13:14,481 --> 02:13:19,481
participating in the process of 
articulating each other's spirits and I 

2618
02:13:19,481 --> 02:13:23,651
mean that most technically like part of 
your spirit is an amalgam of the 

2619
02:13:23,651 --> 02:13:25,400
information that you've encountered.
A lot of that is articulated,

2620
02:13:25,730 --> 02:13:29,000
articulated wisdom and so its sole 
construction.

2621
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,000
If you're having a good conversation and
that's also conversation that is 

2622
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:34,560
meaningful and you can tell that when 
you're having it,

2623
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:38,940
it's that you're.
You're decomposing parts of yourself,

2624
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:43,970
your false presuppositions,
you're letting them die and you're 

2625
02:13:43,970 --> 02:13:47,541
letting something new be born as an 
alternative and you're participating in 

2626
02:13:48,451 --> 02:13:50,820
this process of death and rebirth 
constantly.

2627
02:13:50,821 --> 02:13:52,620
When you're having a meaningful 
conversation,

2628
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:53,280
it's like,
oh,

2629
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:54,110
that was wrong.
Honey,

2630
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:55,090
let that die.
Oh,

2631
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:57,960
that's a little painful.
I was kind of attached to that concept,

2632
02:13:57,961 --> 02:13:59,610
but I'll let it go,
let it burn off,

2633
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:04,820
and a new part of you will emerge and 
then another part dies and the new part 

2634
02:14:04,820 --> 02:14:06,540
emerges,
and that's this process of eternal death

2635
02:14:06,541 --> 02:14:10,290
and rebirth.
It's part of to the general mythology of

2636
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:12,720
redemption and you see that all the time
too,

2637
02:14:12,721 --> 02:14:14,460
and the Harry Potter series,
for example,

2638
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:16,830
at the very end of the Harry Potter 
series,

2639
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:22,550
Potter undergoes a literal death and 
rebirth and that's how he finally 

2640
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:22,550
defeats evil.

2641
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:24,090
These stories are deeply built into 
people.

2642
02:14:24,450 --> 02:14:29,450
There's a reason that that jk rowling 
became the richest person in England by 

2643
02:14:29,450 --> 02:14:33,530
she's richer than the queen.
She got rich by telling the story 

2644
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:33,900
properly,
you know,

2645
02:14:33,901 --> 02:14:36,740
and the second volume of Harry Potter,
when,

2646
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:39,570
when there's the basilisk underneath the
castle that turns you to stone.

2647
02:14:39,571 --> 02:14:42,390
When you look at it,
that's everything that people are afraid

2648
02:14:42,391 --> 02:14:47,391
of that freezes you.
Like a rabbit freezes when it sees a 

2649
02:14:47,391 --> 02:14:51,171
wolf and the story and Harry Potter is 
you go underneath the castle to where 

2650
02:14:51,171 --> 02:14:56,151
the thing that fear frightens you the 
most resides and you face it down and in

2651
02:14:56,941 --> 02:14:58,410
doing that,
you free the virgin,

2652
02:14:58,411 --> 02:14:59,340
right?
That St George,

2653
02:14:59,341 --> 02:15:03,330
he frees Virginia and the Harry Potter 
Story and maybe you have died because of

2654
02:15:03,331 --> 02:15:05,070
that,
because he gets bitten by that.

2655
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:08,490
Baskets can just about dies and then 
it's the phoenix that saves them because

2656
02:15:08,491 --> 02:15:10,530
the Phoenix is the spirit of death and 
rebirth.

2657
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:13,110
These stories,
they come up everywhere.

2658
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:15,660
There's no avoiding them and it's 
because they're true,

2659
02:15:16,260 --> 02:15:17,910
but they're not true like scientific 
truths.

2660
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:20,880
There are different.
There are behavioral truth,

2661
02:15:20,881 --> 02:15:23,400
if are a pragmatic truth or a dramatic 
truth,

2662
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:27,420
and part of the reason that our society 
is so damn on stable now and part of the

2663
02:15:27,421 --> 02:15:32,421
reason all this weird chaos is emerging.
This is a consequence of niches 

2664
02:15:32,421 --> 02:15:34,290
observation back from the late 18 
hundreds about the death of God.

2665
02:15:34,590 --> 02:15:39,590
We blew the metaphysical foundations out
from underneath our culture and the 

2666
02:15:39,590 --> 02:15:40,980
whole thing is shaking and twisting and 
it's.

2667
02:15:40,981 --> 02:15:43,980
It's vacillating between the horrors of 
the extreme,

2668
02:15:43,981 --> 02:15:46,050
right and the horrors of the extreme 
left.

2669
02:15:46,051 --> 02:15:48,720
It's been doing that for 140 years and 
we're in the throes of that.

2670
02:15:48,721 --> 02:15:51,150
Again,
we blew the metaphysical foundations out

2671
02:15:51,151 --> 02:15:54,210
from underneath her culture and we need 
to get them back.

2672
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:59,510
Part of the reason that people are so 
obsessed by things like the avengers 

2673
02:15:59,510 --> 02:16:01,170
movies and superheros and Harry Potter 
and all of that is because,

2674
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:04,820
and Star Trek and star wars is because 
our,

2675
02:16:04,821 --> 02:16:09,821
our collective imagination is trying to 
regroup at the level of drama and 

2676
02:16:10,561 --> 02:16:15,561
reformulate our fundamental metaphysics.
I was reading this thing that was 

2677
02:16:15,561 --> 02:16:20,031
talking.
They were equating crossfit and yoga to 

2678
02:16:20,031 --> 02:16:23,991
religion and they were saying it's 
essentially religion for people that 

2679
02:16:23,991 --> 02:16:26,710
have abandoned traditional religions.
Is that the idea is that we'll receiving

2680
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:30,560
is camaraderie or and discipline

2681
02:16:30,650 --> 02:16:35,650
discipline and some sort of a shared 
community experience.

2682
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:38,390
So when you're talking about when you're
saying your religion,

2683
02:16:38,391 --> 02:16:43,391
you're not talking about a literal 
translation like a guy actually came 

2684
02:16:43,391 --> 02:16:43,391
back from the dead.
Well,

2685
02:16:43,391 --> 02:16:47,830
you're talking about is the concepts and
the thoughts and the harmonious 

2686
02:16:48,590 --> 02:16:53,590
frequency that is achieved when people 
follow the tenets of that religion and 

2687
02:16:53,930 --> 02:16:58,930
live by these laws.
As you were saying of stacking on these 

2688
02:16:58,930 --> 02:16:59,660
ideas,
is this good for you?

2689
02:16:59,810 --> 02:17:04,810
Is it good for the community?
Is it good for the community in five 

2690
02:17:04,810 --> 02:17:04,810
years,
in 10 years,

2691
02:17:04,810 --> 02:17:08,860
and in that,
that that's what you're saying when 

2692
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:08,860
you're talking about,

2693
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:09,010
well,
you're believing love,

2694
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:12,340
relationship thing about that is that 
like imagine that there's,

2695
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:16,150
there's a pathological mode of being 
that so terrible that when you enact it,

2696
02:17:16,151 --> 02:17:21,151
you just die.
A good drug addiction will do that for 

2697
02:17:21,151 --> 02:17:21,151
you.
If you had pursued that meth addiction,

2698
02:17:21,151 --> 02:17:22,690
pursue that for about 10 years,
you know,

2699
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:26,090
and you'll descend to the lower levels 
of hell and then you'll die.

2700
02:17:26,510 --> 02:17:27,080
Right?
Well,

2701
02:17:27,081 --> 02:17:28,850
so then you might might say,
well,

2702
02:17:28,851 --> 02:17:29,570
what's,
what's,

2703
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:33,440
what's at the opposite end of that?
What would be the final manifestation of

2704
02:17:33,770 --> 02:17:36,710
a mode of life that was revivifying and 
healthy?

2705
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:37,910
How,
how,

2706
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:43,030
how,
how redemptive and rejuvenating would 

2707
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:45,851
that be?
And I would say the answer to that is 

2708
02:17:45,851 --> 02:17:46,790
that we don't know.
We have no idea and these ideas of death

2709
02:17:46,791 --> 02:17:49,160
and rebirth are definitely true on the 
micro level,

2710
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:54,400
like so.
The developmental psychologist Piaget 

2711
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:54,400
said,
for example,

2712
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:55,970
that when you incorporated new 
information,

2713
02:17:56,300 --> 02:18:01,300
however you did that learning or 
conversation that that new information 

2714
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:05,231
would exist in in contradiction to 
something that you already presumed and 

2715
02:18:05,231 --> 02:18:09,221
so that thing you presumed would have to
disintegrate and die and and then 

2716
02:18:09,221 --> 02:18:09,221
something new will be born.

2717
02:18:09,221 --> 02:18:11,030
That can happen at different levels of 
analysis,

2718
02:18:11,031 --> 02:18:16,031
so sometimes you learn something minor 
and sometimes you're shook to your 

2719
02:18:16,031 --> 02:18:16,490
bloody core,
you know,

2720
02:18:16,491 --> 02:18:19,730
and and you undergo a descent into the 
underworld fundamentally,

2721
02:18:19,731 --> 02:18:24,731
sometimes even a descent into hell.
That's where you get genocidal and 

2722
02:18:24,731 --> 02:18:26,420
resentful and then maybe you're lucky 
and you pop up reborn.

2723
02:18:26,750 --> 02:18:28,160
Well,
those,

2724
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:33,220
those exist as,
as constant metaphysical truths that 

2725
02:18:33,220 --> 02:18:36,730
that's how human beings transformed.
We don't know the upper limits of that 

2726
02:18:36,730 --> 02:18:40,751
transformation.
We have no idea what that might be 

2727
02:18:40,751 --> 02:18:40,751
because I don't know,
for example,

2728
02:18:40,751 --> 02:18:44,741
how healthy you could be as if you were 
as healthy as you could be if you 

2729
02:18:44,741 --> 02:18:45,790
straightened yourself out completely.
I don't know what,

2730
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:50,800
what your.
What limits you could transcend and 

2731
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:51,710
neither does anybody else,
so we don't know the upper limits of the

2732
02:18:51,711 --> 02:18:56,711
truth of these religious stories.
Now we do know what happens if you let 

2733
02:18:56,711 --> 02:19:00,461
go of them too badly.
You end up with something like the 

2734
02:19:00,461 --> 02:19:03,170
Soviet Union or Mao's China,
which were both based on.

2735
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:04,550
I mean,
they,

2736
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:06,020
they,
they were atheist,

2737
02:19:06,150 --> 02:19:07,220
man.
They were secular.

2738
02:19:07,221 --> 02:19:07,730
They were,
they,

2739
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:08,950
uh,
that they dispense.

2740
02:19:09,090 --> 02:19:14,090
You know,
for Marx it was religion was the opiate 

2741
02:19:14,090 --> 02:19:14,090
of the masses.
It's like,

2742
02:19:14,090 --> 02:19:14,090
it's not like,
I don't understand that,

2743
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:17,870
I understand that,
but it's another one of those situations

2744
02:19:17,871 --> 02:19:20,810
where it's like religion is the opiate 
of the masses.

2745
02:19:20,811 --> 02:19:25,811
Yeah.
And it's also 50 other things and you 

2746
02:19:25,811 --> 02:19:26,540
don't want to forget those.
Like really we know for example,

2747
02:19:26,541 --> 02:19:28,280
from studies,
religious

2748
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:33,280
belief as a human universal.
And the reason for that in part is 

2749
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:36,620
because there is a distinction between 
good and evil and there is a distinction

2750
02:19:36,621 --> 02:19:41,621
between good and bad.
Otherwise you wouldn't do anything like 

2751
02:19:41,621 --> 02:19:41,840
you're always striving for the good.
I mean,

2752
02:19:41,841 --> 02:19:46,841
unless you've taken a malevolent turn,
it's a natural impulse in human beings 

2753
02:19:46,841 --> 02:19:49,670
to make what is better.
While it means we have an.

2754
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:54,940
We have a deeply inbuilt sense of what 
constitutes better and we're all aware 

2755
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:57,030
of that harmonious state that's achieved
well.

2756
02:19:57,370 --> 02:19:57,850
Well,
yeah.

2757
02:19:57,860 --> 02:19:59,450
No.
The thing that's interesting about it,

2758
02:19:59,451 --> 02:20:02,690
like one of the things that need your 
thought was after he announced the death

2759
02:20:02,691 --> 02:20:07,691
of God was that people would be able to 
create new values and Carl Jung took 

2760
02:20:07,691 --> 02:20:12,011
issue with that.
He was a student of niches and he 

2761
02:20:12,011 --> 02:20:12,011
pointed out basically that,
well,

2762
02:20:12,011 --> 02:20:14,210
wait a minute,
who says you can create your own values?

2763
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:17,300
You can't even get yourself out of bed 
to go exercise in the morning.

2764
02:20:17,810 --> 02:20:22,810
You're not under your own control.
Maybe we could discover maybe we could 

2765
02:20:22,810 --> 02:20:27,221
rediscover the values that we once held 
and that's the descent into the 

2766
02:20:27,221 --> 02:20:28,610
underworld and the resurrection of the 
father.

2767
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:30,620
That's what happens in Pinocchio.
For example,

2768
02:20:30,621 --> 02:20:35,621
you know when Pinocchio goes down into 
the depths to face monster and 

2769
02:20:35,621 --> 02:20:40,070
revitalized his dead father,
there's a reason that movie was made in 

2770
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:41,030
the 19 thirties and why it was so 
popular.

2771
02:20:41,031 --> 02:20:43,970
It's like you want to have.
You want to get rid of your damn strings

2772
02:20:43,971 --> 02:20:47,330
and stopped being an erotic jackass.
That's what this story's about is you go

2773
02:20:47,331 --> 02:20:52,331
down to the bottom of the ocean.
You find the thing you're most afraid 

2774
02:20:52,331 --> 02:20:52,331
of.
You face it,

2775
02:20:52,331 --> 02:20:56,590
you rescue your dead father from the 
depths and you rise back to the surface 

2776
02:20:56,751 --> 02:20:58,910
with him.
That's what our culture has to do.

2777
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:01,310
That's what our culture has to do.

2778
02:21:02,670 --> 02:21:07,670
Now,
when you say that your religious person 

2779
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:09,891
though,
people automatically assume that you 

2780
02:21:09,891 --> 02:21:09,900
know there's,
especially in this country,

2781
02:21:09,901 --> 02:21:12,030
the religious right,
there's a very,

2782
02:21:12,031 --> 02:21:17,031
a dogmatic and very simplistic view of 
what God wants and the.

2783
02:21:20,291 --> 02:21:21,000
I mean it,
it,

2784
02:21:21,001 --> 02:21:21,540
it,
it,

2785
02:21:21,541 --> 02:21:26,541
it's lumped into no homosexuals,
a certain restrictions on the behavior 

2786
02:21:26,911 --> 02:21:31,911
of women.
That if you look at the Bible and the 

2787
02:21:31,911 --> 02:21:35,631
Bible is obviously a reflection of the 
people that lived at the time where it 

2788
02:21:35,631 --> 02:21:38,961
was constructed.
Although even trying to figure out when 

2789
02:21:38,961 --> 02:21:38,961
that is,
you know,

2790
02:21:38,961 --> 02:21:41,520
an oral tradition for thousands of years
before it was ever written down,

2791
02:21:41,730 --> 02:21:46,730
written in ancient Hebrew,
translated to Latin and Greek and Roman 

2792
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:46,920
or and I'm English rather.

2793
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:52,190
Well,
there's always a tension in religions 

2794
02:21:52,190 --> 02:21:53,961
between the dogmatic element in this 
spiritual element and conservatives 

2795
02:21:53,961 --> 02:21:58,460
technically speaking,
tend to tend to Marshall themselves on 

2796
02:21:58,460 --> 02:22:02,601
the sides of the more rule oriented and 
dogmatic elements of the religion and 

2797
02:22:02,601 --> 02:22:06,231
liberals roughly speaking,
tend to Marshall themselves more on the 

2798
02:22:06,231 --> 02:22:06,231
spiritual side

2799
02:22:06,231 --> 02:22:10,920
and that's because of the distinction 
that you were saying earlier about the 

2800
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:10,920
behavior patterns of people that

2801
02:22:11,130 --> 02:22:13,410
conservative conscientiousness versus 
openness.

2802
02:22:13,411 --> 02:22:18,411
Roughly speaking,
and I mean the dogmatic structures are 

2803
02:22:18,411 --> 02:22:21,531
necessarily necessary.
The dogma is necessary because it 

2804
02:22:21,531 --> 02:22:24,801
conserves the structure,
but a spiritual aspect is necessary 

2805
02:22:24,801 --> 02:22:29,121
because it updates the and there's 
always this tension and there's a 

2806
02:22:29,121 --> 02:22:32,241
tension in people.
It's like you have to believe things 

2807
02:22:32,241 --> 02:22:32,241
are.
You couldn't exist.

2808
02:22:32,241 --> 02:22:36,171
You couldn't act.
You have to hold onto the dogmatic 

2809
02:22:36,171 --> 02:22:39,141
structure of your belief,
but you have to be open for its update 

2810
02:22:39,141 --> 02:22:42,651
on a continual basis and that's well,
that's basically what consciousness is 

2811
02:22:42,651 --> 02:22:46,071
for that.
Seriously speaking consciousness is the 

2812
02:22:46,071 --> 02:22:49,941
thing that attends to the unknown into 
the anomaly and integrates it with the 

2813
02:22:50,551 --> 02:22:53,280
structure and there's meaning to be 
found in that too.

2814
02:22:53,281 --> 02:22:58,281
That's,
that's to boldly go where no one has 

2815
02:22:58,281 --> 02:22:58,281
gone before.
You know,

2816
02:22:58,281 --> 02:23:01,881
in the,
in the words of the Star Trek Writers 

2817
02:23:01,881 --> 02:23:04,320
and something that deeply appeals to 
young people when they watch that sort 

2818
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:04,320
of thing.

2819
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:08,420
But so what the fundamentalists are 
doing is they're trying to hold onto 

2820
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:10,020
their tradition and it's no bloody 
wonder because if,

2821
02:23:10,130 --> 02:23:15,130
if the tradition falls apart,
you end up isolated and drowning in the 

2822
02:23:15,130 --> 02:23:19,491
ocean alone.
But if the tradition gets too intense 

2823
02:23:19,491 --> 02:23:24,051
and restricted,
well then then you're just clones in a 

2824
02:23:24,051 --> 02:23:24,051
prison.
And that's these.

2825
02:23:24,051 --> 02:23:27,180
That's these two,
two forms of hell in a sense.

2826
02:23:27,181 --> 02:23:28,080
They meet,
you know,

2827
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:31,830
if they get extreme enough,
they meet the hell of absolute chaos and

2828
02:23:31,831 --> 02:23:33,750
the hell of absolute order.
And,

2829
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:39,200
and the Conservatives tend towards the 
hail of absolute order and that and the 

2830
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:41,070
left liberal types tend towards the hell
of absolute chaos.

2831
02:23:41,310 --> 02:23:46,310
There's some point in the middle that's 
the line between Yin and Yang by the 

2832
02:23:46,310 --> 02:23:49,641
way,
because that's order and chaos and the 

2833
02:23:49,641 --> 02:23:49,641
Dow is say,
well,

2834
02:23:49,641 --> 02:23:50,070
that's life.
That's existence.

2835
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:55,130
Order in chaos and order is the place 
you are when what you do works and chaos

2836
02:23:55,801 --> 02:23:59,850
is where you are when what you do 
doesn't work and no matter where you go,

2837
02:24:00,650 --> 02:24:05,580
order and chaos exist and your job is to
be right on the border between those and

2838
02:24:05,581 --> 02:24:10,581
that's to live in Dow,
that's to live in meaning and that's 

2839
02:24:10,581 --> 02:24:13,130
that same place where all these things 
stack up and so well on.

2840
02:24:13,130 --> 02:24:17,520
So with regards to religious tradition,
on the one hand you have to maintain the

2841
02:24:17,521 --> 02:24:22,521
tradition.
It's like maintaining the constitution 

2842
02:24:22,521 --> 02:24:22,521
in the US.
On the other hand,

2843
02:24:22,521 --> 02:24:25,950
you have to be awake and alert because 
the tradition is a dead thing,

2844
02:24:25,951 --> 02:24:30,951
right?
It was composed by dead people in the 

2845
02:24:30,951 --> 02:24:33,171
dead past.
It can't respond as flexibly as it 

2846
02:24:33,171 --> 02:24:37,731
should to the demands of the present.
That's up to you and you do that with 

2847
02:24:37,731 --> 02:24:40,911
your vision,
with your capacity to see and with your 

2848
02:24:40,911 --> 02:24:43,791
capacity to,
to articulate and forever forever really

2849
02:24:44,430 --> 02:24:47,560
the major deities that mankind have 
produced Marta,

2850
02:24:47,990 --> 02:24:52,290
for the Mesopotamians oh,
cyrus or horace horace for the Egyptians

2851
02:24:52,291 --> 02:24:55,440
and and Christ for the Christians and 
Buddha for the Buddhists.

2852
02:24:55,710 --> 02:24:58,920
These [inaudible] have been people who 
are noted for their vision,

2853
02:24:58,921 --> 02:25:03,921
for their ability to watch and pay 
attention because there's nothing more 

2854
02:25:03,921 --> 02:25:03,921
important than the ability to pay 
attention,

2855
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:07,110
pay attention and speak the truth,
your truth,

2856
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:11,520
and that's how you keep everything 
stacked up in order harmoniously.

2857
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:13,800
That's how you keep the balance between 
order and chaos.

2858
02:25:13,801 --> 02:25:18,030
That's how you articulate your being.
That's how you revivify the world.

2859
02:25:18,031 --> 02:25:20,880
That's how you rescue your dead father 
from the bottom of the ocean.

2860
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:24,220
That's how you adopt your responsibility
as a citizen.

2861
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:27,400
That's how you live a proper life and a 
proper life.

2862
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:31,360
I know what a proper life is because I 
thought about this for a long time.

2863
02:25:31,810 --> 02:25:35,860
Life is suffering and suffering can make
you resentful,

2864
02:25:36,130 --> 02:25:41,130
murderous,
and then genocidal if you take it far 

2865
02:25:41,130 --> 02:25:44,311
enough so you need an antidote to 
suffering and maybe you know you could 

2866
02:25:44,311 --> 02:25:44,311
think,
well,

2867
02:25:44,311 --> 02:25:48,300
I'll build walls of luxury around myself
and that'll protect me from the 

2868
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:48,300
suffering.
It's like,

2869
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:52,261
well,
good luck with that because that isn't 

2870
02:25:52,261 --> 02:25:54,040
going to work and maybe you could build 
a delusion and live inside that,

2871
02:25:54,041 --> 02:25:55,780
but now it's going to fall apart.

2872
02:25:56,320 --> 02:26:01,320
Well,
what is there that helps you fight 

2873
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:01,320
against suffering?
That's easy.

2874
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:05,790
That's the truth.
The truth is the antidote to suffering 

2875
02:26:05,790 --> 02:26:10,620
and the reason for that is because the 
truth puts reality behind you so that 

2876
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:14,671
you can face the reality that's coming 
straight at you without becoming weak 

2877
02:26:14,671 --> 02:26:18,370
and degenerating and becoming resentful 
and wishing for the destruction of being

2878
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:23,970
because that's the final hell.
The final hail is your soul wishing for 

2879
02:26:24,971 --> 02:26:28,930
the destruction of everything because 
it's too painful and you're too bitter,

2880
02:26:29,980 --> 02:26:32,860
and that happens to people all the time.
Now,

2881
02:26:32,861 --> 02:26:37,861
as a person who is someone who's 
extremely critical of ideologies,

2882
02:26:39,250 --> 02:26:44,250
a lot of people would think it's a 
contradiction for you to embrace 

2883
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:47,011
religion because religion being the 
biggest and oldest ideology ideology is 

2884
02:26:47,011 --> 02:26:50,470
a parasite on religious substructures.
You can't look.

2885
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:53,560
We could go back to the Harry Potter 
example.

2886
02:26:53,620 --> 02:26:54,580
That's a good example.

2887
02:26:55,590 --> 02:27:00,590
I mean,
jk rowling had kids reading like 400 

2888
02:27:00,590 --> 02:27:00,590
page books,
right?

2889
02:27:00,590 --> 02:27:01,960
She could fill a stadium when she was 
reading.

2890
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:05,110
Why is because she got the archetypes,
right?

2891
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:07,690
She got the religious sub narratives,
correct.

2892
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:12,100
They're not ideologies.
Ideologies work because an etiology is a

2893
02:27:12,101 --> 02:27:15,820
parasite on top of a religious 
substructure and a religious.

2894
02:27:15,870 --> 02:27:19,450
A religious narrative has has a 
particular set of characteristics.

2895
02:27:19,451 --> 02:27:22,090
It's very balanced.
So for example,

2896
02:27:22,690 --> 02:27:24,640
there's the feminist idea of the 
patriarchy.

2897
02:27:25,390 --> 02:27:30,390
While the religious idea of society has 
an evil patriarchy notion built into it,

2898
02:27:32,381 --> 02:27:35,620
that would be the dying king.
The once great dying king.

2899
02:27:35,621 --> 02:27:37,530
You see this in the Egyptian story of 
Osiris,

2900
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:42,570
for example,
who's eventually chopped up by his evil 

2901
02:27:42,570 --> 02:27:42,570
brother.
You see it in the lion king with a,

2902
02:27:43,420 --> 02:27:48,420
with a Fossa and a symbols.
Symbols farther in symbols,

2903
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:50,440
evil,
evil uncle,

2904
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:53,350
those are the two representatives of the
patriarchy,

2905
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:57,430
the wise king in the tyrannical king in 
a religious story,

2906
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:00,710
properly setup archetypal story.
There's,

2907
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:03,310
there's the natural world,
the chaotic world.

2908
02:28:03,311 --> 02:28:05,110
There's a positive element and a 
negative element.

2909
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:08,500
There's the social world,
there's the wise king and the tyrannical

2910
02:28:08,501 --> 02:28:13,501
king and there's the individual world 
and now it's the the adversary and the 

2911
02:28:13,501 --> 02:28:15,070
hero.
There's always a positive and a negative

2912
02:28:15,071 --> 02:28:19,270
at each level and it stops it from being
an oversimplification because it says to

2913
02:28:19,271 --> 02:28:20,050
you,
well,

2914
02:28:20,051 --> 02:28:22,070
of course society is oppressive.

2915
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:27,070
Patriarchy,
but it's also the wise farther that has 

2916
02:28:27,070 --> 02:28:30,251
taught you to speak every word you know.
It's like you don't get to say only this

2917
02:28:32,031 --> 02:28:35,450
part of the story without having 
gratitude for this part of this story,

2918
02:28:35,990 --> 02:28:40,990
and it's true at at each level of the 
representation of properly balanced 

2919
02:28:40,990 --> 02:28:44,150
story is how has got the balance between
positive and negative.

2920
02:28:44,151 --> 02:28:47,300
Always correct.
Is that in many ways,

2921
02:28:47,301 --> 02:28:52,301
like a lot of people who are anti 
western capitalism are also the only.

2922
02:28:53,260 --> 02:28:58,260
They will find that capitalism in 
western capitalism in particular is the 

2923
02:28:58,260 --> 02:29:02,021
only culture that is embraced the 
acceptance of people like transgender 

2924
02:29:02,871 --> 02:29:04,490
people,
people who are gay,

2925
02:29:04,491 --> 02:29:09,491
people who are marginalized.
I mean Western capitalist society is one

2926
02:29:10,791 --> 02:29:13,550
of the very few cultures that openly 
oppose racism.

2927
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:14,630
Right,
right,

2928
02:29:14,690 --> 02:29:15,140
right.
Well,

2929
02:29:15,141 --> 02:29:17,810
and these people are anticapitalist on 
their iphones.

2930
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:20,300
Right.
You don't get to do that.

2931
02:29:20,450 --> 02:29:22,340
Right.
It's a performative contradiction.

2932
02:29:22,341 --> 02:29:23,780
So that's so important.
Yeah.

2933
02:29:23,781 --> 02:29:25,580
They're on their iphones while they're 
flying.

2934
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:26,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

2935
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:28,290
Capitalists.
It's like,

2936
02:29:28,310 --> 02:29:29,060
well,
actually no,

2937
02:29:29,061 --> 02:29:34,061
you're not.
You're just deeply confused as what you 

2938
02:29:34,061 --> 02:29:34,970
are is deeply confused.
It's not capitalism.

2939
02:29:34,971 --> 02:29:35,960
That's the problem.
It's evil.

2940
02:29:35,961 --> 02:29:38,090
It's a problem.
It's.

2941
02:29:38,300 --> 02:29:43,300
Well,
it's also the deeper probe it evil is a 

2942
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:46,361
problem.
So there's a religious scholar named 

2943
02:29:46,361 --> 02:29:48,341
Mercy Eliana who looked at flood myths 
because there are flood myths all over 

2944
02:29:48,341 --> 02:29:48,560
the world.
God gets fed up,

2945
02:29:48,650 --> 02:29:49,810
floods everything.
It's like,

2946
02:29:49,970 --> 02:29:54,970
just like in New Orleans.
So here's a funny thing about New 

2947
02:29:54,970 --> 02:29:58,360
Orleans.
What caused the New Orleans flood or 

2948
02:29:58,360 --> 02:29:58,360
hurricane?
No,

2949
02:29:58,360 --> 02:30:00,200
no.
How about human corruption?

2950
02:30:00,890 --> 02:30:02,350
How about the corruption of,
of,

2951
02:30:02,380 --> 02:30:07,380
of the state.
How about the fact that people knew the 

2952
02:30:07,380 --> 02:30:07,380
dam,
dykes,

2953
02:30:07,380 --> 02:30:08,510
we're going to hold that the levies 
weren't going to hold,

2954
02:30:08,511 --> 02:30:13,511
how about that?
They knew that for 100 years and didn't 

2955
02:30:13,511 --> 02:30:13,511
care.

2956
02:30:13,511 --> 02:30:13,511
How about that?
They pocketed the money that should have

2957
02:30:13,511 --> 02:30:14,900
gone for the repair.
And so in flood myths,

2958
02:30:14,901 --> 02:30:19,100
you always see two things.
You see that I'm paraphrasing,

2959
02:30:19,101 --> 02:30:23,120
say there's a storm,
there's dykes,

2960
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:25,850
and there's people responsible for 
maintaining the dikes.

2961
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:28,040
Well,
the storm will wipe out the city,

2962
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:31,520
it could,
but if the dikes are high enough that it

2963
02:30:31,521 --> 02:30:36,521
won't,
and if people aren't corrupt and they 

2964
02:30:36,521 --> 02:30:38,381
build the dikes properly,
and so god floods the world when the 

2965
02:30:38,381 --> 02:30:41,060
dikes have rotted and the people have 
become corrupt and it's a very old story

2966
02:30:41,061 --> 02:30:43,520
and it's disseminated everywhere.
And the reason is as well,

2967
02:30:44,090 --> 02:30:45,740
we inhabit a,
uh,

2968
02:30:46,390 --> 02:30:49,160
a social structure that's old and,
and,

2969
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:50,270
and,
and dad,

2970
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:53,630
our infrastructures dictate our,
our,

2971
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:59,080
our political,
economic and practical infrastructure 

2972
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:00,080
has decade.
Why it's old everything to case,

2973
02:31:00,110 --> 02:31:02,330
okay?
Everything's already always decaying.

2974
02:31:03,140 --> 02:31:08,140
That's dangerous and corrupt.
People don't do a very good job of 

2975
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:11,681
keeping an order.
And so if things get old and decayed 

2976
02:31:11,681 --> 02:31:12,170
enough,
and if people get corrupt enough,

2977
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:14,240
then God floods the world.
Why?

2978
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:18,140
Because that's what happens over and 
over and over and over and over.

2979
02:31:18,230 --> 02:31:20,100
And you don't mean in the literal sense

2980
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:25,100
of the word.
You mean God as these are the 

2981
02:31:25,100 --> 02:31:27,111
consequences to these types of actions.
You are not prepared for what you 

2982
02:31:27,111 --> 02:31:28,830
transcended reality.
You could look at it that way.

2983
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:29,760
You know?
And,

2984
02:31:29,970 --> 02:31:33,120
and I mean the idea of God is a very,
very complicated idea,

2985
02:31:33,121 --> 02:31:38,121
but you could say if you were thinking 
about it merely merely from an 

2986
02:31:38,121 --> 02:31:41,811
intellectual perspective is you could 
say that God is what transcends your 

2987
02:31:41,811 --> 02:31:42,600
knowledge.
That's all.

2988
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:44,580
It's just,
it's what you don't know.

2989
02:31:44,581 --> 02:31:46,770
It's what's outside of your knowledge 
structures.

2990
02:31:47,010 --> 02:31:52,010
And there's a very old story,
and this goes all the way back to the 

2991
02:31:52,010 --> 02:31:56,180
Tower of Babel,
is that one of the things that 

2992
02:31:56,180 --> 02:31:57,651
characterizes authoritarians is that 
there's never anything outside of their 

2993
02:31:57,651 --> 02:32:01,041
knowledge structures.
They make their notes structures 

2994
02:32:01,041 --> 02:32:01,041
absolute.
So in the Tower of Babel,

2995
02:32:01,041 --> 02:32:03,820
human beings build this structure that's
supposed to reach all the way to have it

2996
02:32:04,710 --> 02:32:04,950
too.

2997
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:07,350
So that we can invade the place of the 
gods.

2998
02:32:07,351 --> 02:32:08,460
Well,
God has none of that.

2999
02:32:08,461 --> 02:32:11,880
He just blows it apart and throws people
all over the world.

3000
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:17,360
And it's a very early dramatic 
representation of the danger of human 

3001
02:32:18,271 --> 02:32:21,660
hubris.
And hubris is we know everything.

3002
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:25,050
There's nothing that needs to be left 
outside of what we know.

3003
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:25,880
It's like,
no,

3004
02:32:25,890 --> 02:32:28,380
that's what God is.
God is what's always outside of what you

3005
02:32:28,381 --> 02:32:33,381
know is the problem with the term God 
though the people think of God as being 

3006
02:32:33,381 --> 02:32:34,950
a man,
they think of it being a person.

3007
02:32:34,951 --> 02:32:38,700
They even use the masculine pronouns in 
reference to God.

3008
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:43,940
I mean,
that's one of the funniest things about 

3009
02:32:43,940 --> 02:32:43,940
God is calling him a he.
Well,

3010
02:32:43,940 --> 02:32:43,940
it's an APP problem.
I mean,

3011
02:32:43,940 --> 02:32:45,390
and,
and that's certainly been a problem.

3012
02:32:45,391 --> 02:32:49,470
Young talked about that a lot about the,
the exclusion of the feminine within the

3013
02:32:49,471 --> 02:32:51,960
domains of Classic Judaeo Christian 
thought.

3014
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:52,710
For example.
I mean,

3015
02:32:52,711 --> 02:32:55,720
you have Mary who's,
who's a kind of a cause identity,

3016
02:32:55,750 --> 02:33:00,750
who,
who pops in sort of like as a fourth 

3017
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:03,051
member of the trinity.
But the exclusion of the feminine is 

3018
02:33:03,051 --> 02:33:03,220
definitely a conceptual problem.
Um,

3019
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:08,100
is the fact that God is conceptualized 
as a human being or as a man a problem?

3020
02:33:08,310 --> 02:33:09,750
It's a problem.
And the solution,

3021
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:13,800
I mean if you,
if you remove the human element of God,

3022
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:19,220
then God gets so abstract that it's easy
for him to float off into space and to 

3023
02:33:19,220 --> 02:33:21,810
never show up again.
Can you lose the human connection?

3024
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:25,680
I mean the way the Catholic solve that 
to some degree is that they have God who

3025
02:33:25,681 --> 02:33:30,681
sort of at the top of the hierarchy and 
then they have this hierarchy of saints 

3026
02:33:30,681 --> 02:33:32,250
who were sort of like gods but half 
human and then they have human beings at

3027
02:33:32,251 --> 02:33:32,730
the bottom.

3028
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:36,240
And that allows for a,
what would you say,

3029
02:33:36,390 --> 02:33:40,410
a continual chain of communication 
between the highest level of abstraction

3030
02:33:40,411 --> 02:33:42,240
in the actual,
you know,

3031
02:33:42,241 --> 02:33:44,360
the actual concrete person.
But,

3032
02:33:45,010 --> 02:33:50,010
but the other,
the other thing that's useful about the 

3033
02:33:50,010 --> 02:33:50,880
conceptualization of God in 
anthropomorphic terms is that,

3034
02:33:50,970 --> 02:33:55,970
and this is worth noting,
is there is nothing more complex in the 

3035
02:33:55,970 --> 02:33:59,721
cosmos than a human being.
So if you're looking for something to 

3036
02:33:59,721 --> 02:34:01,050
represent the ultimate didn't 
complexity,

3037
02:34:01,051 --> 02:34:06,051
it's hard to beat a human being.
So your brain is ungodly complicated,

3038
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:11,540
so to speak.
So I mean these things are obviously too

3039
02:34:11,581 --> 02:34:13,650
complicated to unpack in a,
in a.

3040
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:17,890
In a way I didn't expect to get into 
conversation,

3041
02:34:17,891 --> 02:34:18,010
but

3042
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:19,510
I'm glad we did.
D,

3043
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:24,540
do you think that these stories exist 
because somewhere in our code,

3044
02:34:25,481 --> 02:34:30,481
somewhere in our very being,
we understand that there is a need for 

3045
02:34:30,821 --> 02:34:35,821
this order to find this frequency so 
they're sure they're an expression of 

3046
02:34:35,821 --> 02:34:40,321
our deepest being there.
They're an expression of how it is that 

3047
02:34:40,321 --> 02:34:43,480
we must live in order to live in order 
to reach our full potential.

3048
02:34:43,481 --> 02:34:45,340
Even more than that,
more than that,

3049
02:34:45,341 --> 02:34:50,341
even to avoid hell and you can take the.
All you can think about hell is Nazi 

3050
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:51,580
Germany.
If you want,

3051
02:34:51,610 --> 02:34:56,610
you can think about it as the Soviet 
Gulag archipelago or Mao's cultural 

3052
02:34:56,610 --> 02:34:58,210
revolution like we can get there.
No problem.

3053
02:34:58,211 --> 02:35:03,211
If you,
you walk down in some of the seedier 

3054
02:35:03,211 --> 02:35:03,211
areas in La,
you'll see people in hell no problem.

3055
02:35:03,220 --> 02:35:04,930
Sure.
Go to skid row.

3056
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:05,650
Yes,
yes.

3057
02:35:05,651 --> 02:35:07,960
And you can tell where the,
when those people are there,

3058
02:35:07,961 --> 02:35:09,580
because they will get angry.

3059
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:14,580
If you look at them and you'll,
you'll walk a big birth around them.

3060
02:35:14,711 --> 02:35:17,440
You're not going to come within 10 feet 
of the,

3061
02:35:18,250 --> 02:35:21,880
let's call it psycho,
geography of their existence.

3062
02:35:22,750 --> 02:35:23,850
Right,
and that they're,

3063
02:35:23,851 --> 02:35:26,380
they're in a place,
it's a metaphysical place,

3064
02:35:26,381 --> 02:35:27,190
but it's,
but it's,

3065
02:35:28,290 --> 02:35:31,810
it's not defined by the dam geography,
you know,

3066
02:35:31,930 --> 02:35:35,740
skid row is as much of a psychological 
place as it is a physical place.

3067
02:35:35,741 --> 02:35:40,741
In fact,
it's more that Maura psychological 

3068
02:35:40,741 --> 02:35:42,571
place,
but that doesn't make it any less a 

3069
02:35:42,571 --> 02:35:44,491
place and if you're descend into the 
hell of skid row deep enough,

3070
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:50,280
you'll get to the point where most of 
your thoughts or murderous and that's 

3071
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:50,280
like,
that's,

3072
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:52,990
that's hell as a suburb of the 
underworld.

3073
02:35:52,991 --> 02:35:55,510
Fundamentally those,
that place exists.

3074
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:59,440
People visited all the time and 
sometimes they don't get out.

3075
02:36:00,490 --> 02:36:03,400
It's real.
I've been discussing this a lot recently

3076
02:36:03,401 --> 02:36:05,890
because people like to talk about the 
concept of apocalypse,

3077
02:36:05,891 --> 02:36:10,891
that we're headed towards an impending 
apocalypse and my thought is that 

3078
02:36:10,891 --> 02:36:11,080
apocalypse is already here.

3079
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:12,500
It's just not right here.
Yeah.

3080
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:15,880
It's always go to Liberia,
go to Liberia and look at people,

3081
02:36:15,890 --> 02:36:18,100
devastating this treats and eating human
flesh.

3082
02:36:18,101 --> 02:36:23,101
I mean they do.
I don't know if you've ever seen the 

3083
02:36:23,101 --> 02:36:23,101
vice piece on Liberia,
but it's.

3084
02:36:23,101 --> 02:36:26,300
It's unbelievably terrifying.
The whole live there,

3085
02:36:26,340 --> 02:36:31,340
the apocalypse is the apocalypse is an 
archetypal idea and the apocalypse is 

3086
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:34,480
always here and it's here.
It's here at the micro level,

3087
02:36:34,690 --> 02:36:37,520
like when we have a discussion in our 
concepts change.

3088
02:36:37,521 --> 02:36:40,870
Those are micro apocalypses,
little bits of our being are being blown

3089
02:36:40,871 --> 02:36:45,871
apart and restructured and that can be 
happen at a small scale or large scale 

3090
02:36:45,871 --> 02:36:47,380
or it can.
It can get to the point where everything

3091
02:36:47,470 --> 02:36:52,470
collapses and is destroyed and life is 
apocalyptic in that matter because we 

3092
02:36:52,991 --> 02:36:54,460
all get sick.
We all die.

3093
02:36:54,580 --> 02:36:55,570
You know,
our families,

3094
02:36:55,571 --> 02:37:00,571
our vulnerable.
There's an apocalyptic element to being 

3095
02:37:00,571 --> 02:37:03,511
and we and we have to face that and 
confronted and deal with it properly 

3096
02:37:03,511 --> 02:37:07,860
and,
and the wrong way to deal with it is to,

3097
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:13,260
is to,
is to generate more hell than heaven I 

3098
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:15,100
suppose,
and to do that consciously.

3099
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:20,110
And people do that all the time too.
There's never a situation that's so bad 

3100
02:37:20,110 --> 02:37:23,591
that there isn't something you can do to
make it worse and there's very seldomly 

3101
02:37:23,591 --> 02:37:27,731
a time when you're not motivated at some
level of your being to put the knife in 

3102
02:37:28,341 --> 02:37:30,680
and twist it.
Just one more quarter turn.

3103
02:37:31,190 --> 02:37:34,100
People are like that and we have reason.
Life is hard.

3104
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:36,020
It's no wonder people get corrupted by 
it.

3105
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:40,700
It's not an easy thing to.
To live in a.

3106
02:37:43,270 --> 02:37:46,870
it's not an easy thing to live,
let's say in a truthful manner,

3107
02:37:47,390 --> 02:37:48,790
but,
but the alternative,

3108
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:51,390
the alternative is hell.
I mean,

3109
02:37:51,400 --> 02:37:54,460
part of the reason that I made these 
videos to begin with was because,

3110
02:37:55,380 --> 02:37:58,540
and I learned a lot about the importance
of spoken truth as a,

3111
02:37:58,541 --> 02:38:03,541
as a,
as the countervailing force against 

3112
02:38:03,541 --> 02:38:07,470
tyranny and authoritarianism.
It isn't an alternative political 

3113
02:38:07,470 --> 02:38:07,470
structure.
That's the countervailing force.

3114
02:38:07,740 --> 02:38:08,700
It's,
it's this,

3115
02:38:08,760 --> 02:38:11,290
it's spoken truth.
That's the countervailing force.

3116
02:38:11,291 --> 02:38:11,980
It's like,
well,

3117
02:38:11,981 --> 02:38:16,981
why would I put my job on the line to 
have an opinion about compelled 

3118
02:38:16,981 --> 02:38:17,200
pronouns?
I know why,

3119
02:38:19,710 --> 02:38:24,570
because the ability to speak your truth 
is the bulwark against hell

3120
02:38:25,860 --> 02:38:28,650
and losing your job.
That's nothing.

3121
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:34,320
That's nothing compared to where things 
can go when they go badly.

3122
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:39,800
For me it was just preventative.
It's like this isn't going in a good 

3123
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:39,990
direction.
Well,

3124
02:38:39,991 --> 02:38:42,810
should you take a risk?
It's like you don't have that choice.

3125
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:45,990
You're silent.
That's a risk.

3126
02:38:46,500 --> 02:38:51,500
Now.
Most people don't understand the risks 

3127
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:53,331
of silence.
I happen to understand the risks of 

3128
02:38:53,331 --> 02:38:54,810
sadness because I had been studying them
for 40 years.

3129
02:38:55,320 --> 02:39:00,320
Is it frustrating for you to get so 
little support for these actions and 

3130
02:39:00,961 --> 02:39:02,260
for,
for your,

3131
02:39:02,261 --> 02:39:04,320
your protests?
Well,

3132
02:39:04,321 --> 02:39:06,190
I,
I wouldn't say that that's what happened

3133
02:39:06,191 --> 02:39:11,191
and I don't mean so little support 
because you're going a lot of support 

3134
02:39:11,191 --> 02:39:11,520
outside of the,
in the outside of the university.

3135
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:17,000
It's okay.
It doesn't matter where the support 

3136
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:17,000
comes from.
Like I mean it's,

3137
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,320
it's disappointing in the same way that 
it's disappointing for me to say.

3138
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:21,900
I think the universities now do more 
harm than good.

3139
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:24,090
That's disappointing,
but.

3140
02:39:25,110 --> 02:39:26,430
But it,
it doesn't,

3141
02:39:26,490 --> 02:39:31,020
it's not surprising to me.
I guess it isn't as if intellectuals are

3142
02:39:31,021 --> 02:39:34,200
characterized by an intrinsic moral 
superiority.

3143
02:39:34,201 --> 02:39:35,010
Oh,
they're smart.

3144
02:39:35,011 --> 02:39:37,110
So they'll leap to the defense of what's
right.

3145
02:39:37,111 --> 02:39:37,830
It's like,
no,

3146
02:39:38,430 --> 02:39:43,380
there's no evidence for that 
intelligence and and moral wisdom aren't

3147
02:39:43,650 --> 02:39:47,070
the same thing like and if you're 
corrupt and smart,

3148
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:49,650
all that makes you is way more 
treacherous.

3149
02:39:49,740 --> 02:39:51,950
It doesn't make you less likely to be 
corrupt.

3150
02:39:51,951 --> 02:39:56,951
It just makes you much more your 50 
snakes instead of two or your 56 headed 

3151
02:39:58,231 --> 02:40:01,350
snakes instead of to like I've had 
clients who were,

3152
02:40:01,650 --> 02:40:03,810
who had very serious personality 
disorders,

3153
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:08,900
who are very intelligent.
It's like that's not necessarily a good 

3154
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:10,950
thing for them.
They're just better at arguing for their

3155
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:16,400
pathology to.
That is a real problem where people 

3156
02:40:16,400 --> 02:40:18,480
automatically assume that intelligent 
people are going to be healthy.

3157
02:40:19,970 --> 02:40:24,970
Yeah,
well they're healthy in that often 

3158
02:40:24,970 --> 02:40:24,970
psychological,
better in the world,

3159
02:40:24,970 --> 02:40:28,301
you know,
because because their skills are more 

3160
02:40:28,301 --> 02:40:29,000
marketable and so on,
but there's no evidence that there's any

3161
02:40:29,001 --> 02:40:31,160
relationship between intelligence and 
morality.

3162
02:40:31,640 --> 02:40:32,780
I mean,
God,

3163
02:40:32,810 --> 02:40:35,450
let me tell you a story man.
One time I have this client,

3164
02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:39,140
this woman was just ruined.
She looked like a street person,

3165
02:40:39,141 --> 02:40:44,141
you know,
and she had very dirty clothes and she 

3166
02:40:44,141 --> 02:40:44,141
was so shy that she couldn't even 
approach you.

3167
02:40:44,141 --> 02:40:46,940
She had to shield her eyes from you as 
if you are emitting light.

3168
02:40:46,941 --> 02:40:48,710
And she did that to everyone on the 
street,

3169
02:40:48,711 --> 02:40:50,600
like he was bent over and,
and,

3170
02:40:50,990 --> 02:40:51,980
and,
and humble,

3171
02:40:51,981 --> 02:40:56,981
like a,
like a Chinese peasant brought before 

3172
02:40:56,981 --> 02:40:56,981
the emperor,
you know.

3173
02:40:56,981 --> 02:41:00,850
And uh,
one of the things I was doing with her 

3174
02:41:00,850 --> 02:41:03,671
and behavior therapy was trying to just 
get her to present herself in a more 

3175
02:41:03,671 --> 02:41:07,361
normal manner so that people wouldn't 
shy away from her and be instantly 

3176
02:41:07,361 --> 02:41:07,790
prejudice towards her.

3177
02:41:08,390 --> 02:41:12,950
And she'd come to the behavior therapy 
clinic and she wasn't bright.

3178
02:41:13,010 --> 02:41:16,010
This woman thinks she had only had like 
a seventh grade education.

3179
02:41:16,011 --> 02:41:18,920
She was quite intellectually impaired 
and she lived with her.

3180
02:41:19,220 --> 02:41:23,210
Her sick aunt who was,
who has schizophrenia and who had a,

3181
02:41:23,211 --> 02:41:28,211
like a,
a satanic possessed alcoholic boyfriend 

3182
02:41:28,211 --> 02:41:32,420
that was always tormenting my client.
She lived in absolute hell,

3183
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:38,440
but she had this dog and she used to 
take it out and walk the dog all the 

3184
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:38,440
time.
And then she,

3185
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:41,780
she'd actually come to the behavior 
therapy clinic partly because of her own

3186
02:41:41,781 --> 02:41:42,290
problem.
But,

3187
02:41:42,890 --> 02:41:47,890
but she'd come to this place called the 
Douglas Hospital and she'd been an 

3188
02:41:47,890 --> 02:41:48,320
inpatient in the Douglas Hospital in 
India,

3189
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:53,500
in the Douglas Hospital.
There were these long term psychiatric 

3190
02:41:53,500 --> 02:41:57,251
clients and they looked like something 
out of a Hieronymus Bosch painting or 

3191
02:41:57,251 --> 02:41:57,260
Dante's inferno.
I mean these people were.

3192
02:41:57,570 --> 02:42:00,020
This is way worse than one flew over the
cuckoo's nest.

3193
02:42:00,021 --> 02:42:03,680
These people were seriously destroyed 
and they couldn't be let back out in the

3194
02:42:03,681 --> 02:42:08,681
streets during deinstitutionalization,
like they were lifers and she had 

3195
02:42:08,681 --> 02:42:12,851
decided that part of the reason she 
wanted to come to the hospitalist 

3196
02:42:12,851 --> 02:42:15,250
because she had been institutionalized 
there and she thought that maybe when 

3197
02:42:15,410 --> 02:42:20,410
she took her dog out for a walk,
she could go and get one of those damn 

3198
02:42:20,410 --> 02:42:21,050
inmates and take them out for a walk to

3199
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:26,420
now that was a person who is a moral 
dumb as a post,

3200
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:30,710
just screwed in 50 different directions.
Nothing going for her.

3201
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:36,160
And she had that bloody moral capacity 
to decide that there was someone worse 

3202
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:40,661
off than her and believe me,
that wasn't easy to find and that maybe 

3203
02:42:40,661 --> 02:42:40,661
she could do them some good.
If,

3204
02:42:40,661 --> 02:42:42,470
if the hospital would letter,
which they didn't,

3205
02:42:42,500 --> 02:42:45,160
by the way.
Yeah,

3206
02:42:45,161 --> 02:42:47,650
well that's the story of the soul.
That's not the intellect,

3207
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:49,890
that's for sure.
So,

3208
02:42:50,550 --> 02:42:54,760
so I didn't expect any support from my,
from my colleagues.

3209
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:58,750
And it isn't that I don't care if I got 
it,

3210
02:42:58,751 --> 02:43:00,910
but it's,
it's in some sense it's irrelevant.

3211
02:43:01,660 --> 02:43:06,160
It's irrelevant to me because my goal 
was,

3212
02:43:07,690 --> 02:43:10,960
I'm not saying those God damn pronouns 
and the,

3213
02:43:11,290 --> 02:43:12,010
I'm not saying them

3214
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:17,010
is because they're made up by left wing 
ideologues and I don't like left wing 

3215
02:43:17,010 --> 02:43:21,961
ideology.
I don't like ediology period and I know 

3216
02:43:21,961 --> 02:43:22,090
where

3217
02:43:23,350 --> 02:43:27,250
corruption of speech leads and I'm not 
going there.

3218
02:43:28,150 --> 02:43:33,150
And you know,
one of the things I tried to learn when 

3219
02:43:33,150 --> 02:43:35,731
I was taking apart what happened in 
Auschwitz and trying to put myself in 

3220
02:43:35,731 --> 02:43:37,630
the position of an Auschwitz camp guard,
which by the way you can do,

3221
02:43:37,631 --> 02:43:42,631
if you use your imagination a bit,
I wouldn't call it exactly the world's 

3222
02:43:42,631 --> 02:43:46,111
most pleasant meditative experience,
but you can call up parts of yourself 

3223
02:43:46,111 --> 02:43:50,581
that would be capable of taking someone 
who just got off a transport train and 

3224
02:43:50,581 --> 02:43:55,201
having them carry a 100 pound sack of 
wet salt from one side of the camp 

3225
02:43:55,201 --> 02:43:58,030
compound to the other and back.
You can conjure that part of yourself up

3226
02:43:58,031 --> 02:44:03,031
if you want.
And that'll teach you something about 

3227
02:44:03,031 --> 02:44:05,221
what you're like.
People don't do it because it's too 

3228
02:44:05,221 --> 02:44:08,191
frightening,
but I know perfectly well that I could 

3229
02:44:08,191 --> 02:44:11,041
do that sort of thing.
And so once I learned that I could do 

3230
02:44:11,041 --> 02:44:11,041
that sort of thing and maybe that I 
could even enjoy it,

3231
02:44:11,041 --> 02:44:11,590
I thought,
okay,

3232
02:44:11,591 --> 02:44:12,430
fine.
I get it.

3233
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:17,700
I'm going to see if I can figure out how
to live so that if that opportunity was 

3234
02:44:17,700 --> 02:44:18,550
presented to me,
I wouldn't take it.

3235
02:44:20,370 --> 02:44:25,370
And I think that's the lesson that 
people need to learn from the 20th 

3236
02:44:25,370 --> 02:44:25,370
century.
It's like that's what human beings did.

3237
02:44:25,410 --> 02:44:26,730
Okay,
well we're all human.

3238
02:44:26,731 --> 02:44:28,500
Okay,
so how is it that we should live so that

3239
02:44:28,501 --> 02:44:29,790
we don't do that again?

3240
02:44:31,050 --> 02:44:31,440
Well,

3241
02:44:32,990 --> 02:44:36,050
part of that is to try to say the truth

3242
02:44:37,540 --> 02:44:42,540
no matter what,
because the alternative is worse and it 

3243
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:44,260
is worse.
The truth no matter what.

3244
02:44:44,290 --> 02:44:49,290
And that is the real problem that you 
see with being forced into using these 

3245
02:44:49,290 --> 02:44:50,590
made up pronouns.
Yeah,

3246
02:44:50,591 --> 02:44:54,400
absolutely.
It's my language all take responsibility

3247
02:44:54,401 --> 02:44:59,401
for what I say I have not say in your 
words and being compelled to say your 

3248
02:44:59,531 --> 02:45:01,630
words by law.
Well that's that,

3249
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:02,860
that,
that makes it,

3250
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:06,970
that that takes it past the point of 
absurdity to the point of tyranny in,

3251
02:45:06,980 --> 02:45:08,280
in my estimation.
And I,

3252
02:45:08,281 --> 02:45:10,690
and I've seen some criticisms where 
people are saying,

3253
02:45:10,691 --> 02:45:12,520
you know,
he's talking about this,

3254
02:45:12,521 --> 02:45:15,400
but really he's grandstanding because no
one's doing anything legally,

3255
02:45:15,670 --> 02:45:19,810
but the potential exists such rubbish.
But that is one of the arguments.

3256
02:45:20,020 --> 02:45:25,020
Yes,
they wouldn't have changed the damn 

3257
02:45:25,020 --> 02:45:26,371
criminal.
They put it in the hate speech category 

3258
02:45:26,371 --> 02:45:27,760
and altered the criminal code.
It's as simple as that,

3259
02:45:27,761 --> 02:45:28,990
and then you could say,
well,

3260
02:45:28,991 --> 02:45:30,160
no,
we didn't really mean it.

3261
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:30,820
It's like,
oh yeah,

3262
02:45:30,821 --> 02:45:35,821
you did.
You really meant it to have the social 

3263
02:45:35,821 --> 02:45:38,131
justice warriors that have debated being
the last two months accused me directly 

3264
02:45:38,131 --> 02:45:39,940
of hate speech.
All I had to do was poke them a tiny bit

3265
02:45:39,941 --> 02:45:44,941
and they came right out with it and then
the university's legal team reviewed 

3266
02:45:44,941 --> 02:45:47,710
everything I said carefully believed me 
and they decided that,

3267
02:45:48,040 --> 02:45:52,960
oh,
it was not only illegal to not use these

3268
02:45:52,961 --> 02:45:57,961
compelled pronouns.
It was probably illegal to make a video 

3269
02:45:57,961 --> 02:46:00,721
saying that I wouldn't use them because 
otherwise why would they write me a 

3270
02:46:00,721 --> 02:46:04,501
warning letter and tell me that I 
violated university policy on the 

3271
02:46:04,501 --> 02:46:05,830
Ontario Human Rights Act?
They did that lightly.

3272
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:08,770
Have they acted on this at all?
Is there they won't know.

3273
02:46:08,780 --> 02:46:11,030
Well acted in that.
They sent me to warning,

3274
02:46:11,050 --> 02:46:16,050
reverse and told me to stop talking and 
the idea that I was going to be teaching

3275
02:46:16,761 --> 02:46:21,761
in January again because I teach all my 
undergraduate courses from January to 

3276
02:46:21,761 --> 02:46:24,080
May that was on the table and I think 
the only reason that it hasn't happened,

3277
02:46:24,740 --> 02:46:29,740
one of the reasons it hasn't happened 
and I'm not attributing nothing but 

3278
02:46:29,740 --> 02:46:33,701
malevolence to the university 
administration because obviously it's 

3279
02:46:33,701 --> 02:46:34,010
very complicated and they did agree to 
host the debate,

3280
02:46:34,011 --> 02:46:37,670
for example,
but the idea that I wouldn't be teaching

3281
02:46:37,671 --> 02:46:42,671
in January and still might not be is by 
no means that was a perfectly plausible 

3282
02:46:46,100 --> 02:46:51,100
outcome and had this not caused a 
firestorm much of which has emerged in 

3283
02:46:52,101 --> 02:46:52,940
supportive me.

3284
02:46:53,570 --> 02:46:58,570
Then I would say there was a 50 slash 50
chance that I would've had my teaching 

3285
02:46:58,570 --> 02:47:01,340
privileges revoked,
tabbing to other professors.

3286
02:47:01,610 --> 02:47:06,610
So the idea that I'm making it,
I like that this is a tempest in a 

3287
02:47:06,610 --> 02:47:06,610
teapot.
It's like,

3288
02:47:06,610 --> 02:47:06,610
yeah,
okay,

3289
02:47:06,610 --> 02:47:11,501
fine.
Why did you change the criminal code 

3290
02:47:11,501 --> 02:47:13,511
then?
And why'd you put it under the hate 

3291
02:47:13,511 --> 02:47:13,511
speech laws?
Exactly.

3292
02:47:13,940 --> 02:47:15,890
So no doesn't wash

3293
02:47:17,460 --> 02:47:19,590
and I.
and the fundamental proof of that is the

3294
02:47:19,591 --> 02:47:24,591
university's response because for sure 
there are legal team crafted those 

3295
02:47:24,591 --> 02:47:28,650
letters in recalcitrant employee,
you're responsible for them.

3296
02:47:28,651 --> 02:47:33,651
Okay,
what do you do with a recalcitrant 

3297
02:47:33,651 --> 02:47:35,361
employed?
You write them a letter telling them 

3298
02:47:35,361 --> 02:47:35,361
what they're doing wrong and asking them
to stop.

3299
02:47:35,361 --> 02:47:39,620
Then if they don't stop,
you write them a second letter that's 

3300
02:47:39,620 --> 02:47:39,620
more strongly worded.
Then if they don't stop,

3301
02:47:39,620 --> 02:47:42,120
you write them a third letter,
even more strongly worded.

3302
02:47:42,450 --> 02:47:47,010
Then you take disciplinary action.
That's like her one on one.

3303
02:47:47,340 --> 02:47:49,670
That's how you do it.
So,

3304
02:47:49,910 --> 02:47:53,580
so here we said at the end of November,
a closing on December,

3305
02:47:53,581 --> 02:47:57,600
you're literally a a bit more than a 
month away and you don't know whether or

3306
02:47:57,601 --> 02:47:59,430
not you're teaching your courses.
In January,

3307
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:08,900
it seems highly probable that I'll be 
teaching them.

3308
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:12,080
I wouldn't say it's certain,
but if I'm teaching them,

3309
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:17,320
it's because the cost of having me not 
teach them would now be too high.

3310
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:23,500
It's not because the university believes
that what I'm doing is either necessary 

3311
02:48:25,611 --> 02:48:30,611
or acceptable.
If someone who's listening to this or 

3312
02:48:30,611 --> 02:48:33,230
watching this feels compelled to act out
in your support,

3313
02:48:33,290 --> 02:48:34,130
how can they do that?

3314
02:48:37,230 --> 02:48:42,230
I think they could do the future 
authoring exercise and that that would 

3315
02:48:42,230 --> 02:48:43,880
be the best way to act out and you're,
I'm,

3316
02:48:44,070 --> 02:48:48,030
I'm dead serious about this is like sort
yourself out,

3317
02:48:48,450 --> 02:48:51,490
sort yourself out before you try to 
figure out the world and the past.

3318
02:48:51,690 --> 02:48:53,490
That's the primary objective.
That's your,

3319
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:57,120
that's your most important thing that 
you can do so yourself out sort yourself

3320
02:48:57,121 --> 02:49:02,121
out and,
and Marshall your arguments and put 

3321
02:49:02,121 --> 02:49:04,551
yourself in order so that when someone 
pushes you a little farther than you 

3322
02:49:04,681 --> 02:49:07,860
should go,
you can say no and you know what's going

3323
02:49:07,861 --> 02:49:08,070
on

3324
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:08,590
now.
Yeah,

3325
02:49:09,180 --> 02:49:12,060
I think that's outstanding advice.
That's very,

3326
02:49:12,061 --> 02:49:13,770
very important advice.
And uh,

3327
02:49:13,771 --> 02:49:16,080
I think this has been one of my favorite
podcasts ever.

3328
02:49:16,290 --> 02:49:19,740
I really appreciate you coming on.
I appreciate everything you've done.

3329
02:49:20,070 --> 02:49:25,070
I appreciate you having the courage to 
stick your neck out and I appreciate 

3330
02:49:25,070 --> 02:49:28,551
also,
you're incredibly well thought out 

3331
02:49:28,551 --> 02:49:28,551
arguments for the,
for those actions,

3332
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:29,790
so thank you.
Thank you.

3333
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:32,040
How do people get Ahold of your youtube 
page?

3334
02:49:32,041 --> 02:49:35,010
What is your youtube page?
Was the Jordan Peterson videos,

3335
02:49:35,220 --> 02:49:38,700
Jordan Peterson videos on youtube and do
you use twitter?

3336
02:49:38,701 --> 02:49:41,440
I know you put your twitter page out,
but you use it so.

3337
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:43,290
And that is Jordan,
Jordan,

3338
02:49:43,291 --> 02:49:44,700
b Peterson Peterson,
yeah.

3339
02:49:44,701 --> 02:49:45,720
Okay.
Thank you sir.

3340
02:49:45,721 --> 02:49:46,950
I really,
really appreciate it.

3341
02:49:46,980 --> 02:49:47,910
It was a.
It was an honor.

3342
02:49:47,940 --> 02:49:49,410
Thank you.
