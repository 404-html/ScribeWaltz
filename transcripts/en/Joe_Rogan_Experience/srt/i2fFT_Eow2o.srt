1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
They'd be really careful. We don't talk
over each other because, um, you know,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,340
it's fucking, it's hard not to. There's
six of us here. Yeah, Brian. All right.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,210
We're live. We're live. You fucking
freaks. Ladies and gentleman,

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,890
this is an unprecedented podcast.

5
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:17,760
This is the first time we've ever
done an after the fact podcast.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,020
Brendan Schaub and I know all the
Goddamn results. I honey else,

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,670
Brian knows one result. Yeah. Eddie knows
none. Robyn. I know. He knows a mom.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,800
Yeah, the only one. So this is
beautiful. So no one's going to cheat a,

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,080
we're not gonna, we're not
gonna fix, but a, we decided,

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,790
we've got a bunch of people here.
Jimmy Burke's here.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,390
Our friend Jimmy Burke from New York was
in town for Brian's birthday party last

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,630
night. Uh, Eddie Bravo was here. Of
course, Brian counts here. Brendan Schaub,

13
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,600
Robin Blacks and towns and
Robin blacks here. So, uh,

14
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,620
it's gonna be a lot of talking
over each other folks. Okay.

15
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:49,680
It's just deal with that.
Just deal with that.

16
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,570
We're going to watch the fights and uh,

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,290
and again also if you are expecting
any of us to like constantly watch the

18
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:01,290
fights only and not, that's not going to
happen either. So there's no rules. Okay.

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,540
Whatever expectations you have released
those or, or whatever, you know,

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,820
one of these or worrisome. All
right. Right now we're playing it.

21
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,290
We're going to start it and we recorded
it. So this is the first time we've,

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,780
we've got a recording and we're
going to watch the fights.

23
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:18,190
I'm going to fast forward to
when should I fast forward.

24
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:20,220
I should fast forward the
first fight, right? Yeah.

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,290
Really sit down at anyways, let's
watch the commercials. All that shit.

26
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,823
I'm excited about this,

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,380
but the problem is we can't really
play it out loud where we can hear on

28
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,270
podcasts. I know, but
that's what I'm saying.

29
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,310
So we might as well just fast
forward through all this nonsense.

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,610
This pregame bulls. Yeah.
It's kind of like porn.

31
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:41,020
So there's some good fights
in this fucking card. Um,

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,520
is good fights in actuality and
good fights on yes. Most of it all.

33
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:49,130
And Cowboy Dude. Yeah. Dude. Damn man.

34
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,160
Really does know the result. I
love it. I love the just, man.

35
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,330
I had to watch that fight. I just had
been out of the loop. I want to hear,

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,610
I can't wait for your breakdown.
Robin black. So here we go.

37
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:04,000
We're a fast forward through Jon
Anik and is super metro-sexual toss

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,140
that towel. Wow. Rock and
purple ties. Maybe it's um,

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,270
for in Omaj to Prince. So, uh,
we'll, we'll fast forward on cancer.

40
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,200
Yeah, why not, man? So
the first fight is uh,

41
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,010
Alex Caceres versus,
um,

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,810
what's homeboy's name that he fights?
He fights a dude from Alan Belcher's camp.

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,700
He's a wild man. Read Night Jason.
Nice Jason Nights. That's right.

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,980
He's fucking good. Yeah, he's very good.
And he's crazy and he's got to talk to,

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,990
he talks mad shit inside the octagon to,

46
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,620
he has his fight and he was screaming
at this dude going, come on man.

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,320
Take me down now. You want to take me
down? You want to stay on with me, bitch?

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,630
Yeah. He said, you don't want
to take now bitch. I was like

49
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,660
delirious. Hilarious. I came out
on the broadcast. Yeah, yeah.

50
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:57,030
Well I was laughing while it
was happening because, uh,

51
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,040
I was doing the commentary
and while I was going down,

52
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,480
not during this broadcast
was another broadcast.

53
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,580
This fight is with him and Alex Caceres.
So this is a,

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,560
uh, like a kind of a sleeper. A fight.
Yeah. Cool. Fight. All right, here we go.

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,870
Boom. All right, so for the folks at home,

56
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:18,170
what we'll do is when the first fight
starts, right now they're showing the, um,

57
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,480
a side by side comparisons, the heights
and weights and jazz, a tale of the tape.

58
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,670
And now Bruce buffer is doing
a little introduction here.

59
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,870
Why do they call it the tale of the tape?
It's been that for 50 years bikes,

60
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,660
somebody invented that. That was new
ones. Well, you know what's weird man?

61
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,120
How can they stop?
They stop measuring legs.

62
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,910
They measured legs for a little while
and then they stop measuring legs.

63
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,200
They were doing only weeks. Yeah,
did it for filtering and box.

64
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:45,400
And they measured late. We were always
complaining like with John Jones,

65
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:48,490
you're not fighting his arms. You're
finding his arms and his fucking legs.

66
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,360
And he's so tall.

67
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:54,180
Wall gun give is Joe Silva who asked
for leg reach I think. Yes. Yeah.

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
Joe asked for a lot of shit.
He's the,

69
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,500
he's the reason why a Mickey galls hey
Mickey, you're so fine. You're so fine.

70
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,000
You're right. That's how it got on the
uh, the broadcast because Dana White,

71
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:05,980
it was like,
fuck that.

72
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:08,720
You can't play that song for Mickey
Gallo when he fought cm punk, you know,

73
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,610
you know Dana so particular he goes
through all the walkout songs before cause

74
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:16,660
he loves music. He shot one of my walkout
songs down the night before the fight.

75
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,640
What was the song? It was a, I forget
in Brazil there's some cool song.

76
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:25,240
I thought it was cool. It's like a
dance song and I get a call in my, uh,

77
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,240
my coach was like, Hey, it's Dana.
Why might go shit, what's going on?

78
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:30,750
I'm letting you know bonus earlier some
cause I thought I was going to knock out

79
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:33,850
Nogueira out and like just give
it to me now. And he's like, hey,

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,960
that walkout sounds not happening.
Picks up the Nelson. I was like, wow,

81
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,660
this is, what did you pick?
A I m and m square dance.

82
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,200
Oh, okay. All right. Alex,

83
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:50,201
get Sarah's and Jason Knight
for 57 50 64554504453 all right.

84
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:55,380
Sync it up cause Sarah's the shelf on
the left hand, right. Get inside leg.

85
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,200
Bruce Leroy, you Harris is super
underrated. Him mean you gotta.

86
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:04,201
You gotta remember what Yaya Rodriguez
did to Bj Penn and then think of him and

87
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:08,410
[inaudible]. They essentially fought
to basically might've been a draw.

88
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,060
That's a style matchup, but don't you
think way for me with Bruce Leroy.

89
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,140
I like him. He's fun to watch. We still
hot and Cole. Yeah, he's on. He's off.

90
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:17,974
He's gone.
He's off.

91
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,410
Craig Jackson used Leroy for most of
the sparring rounds for Bj. No Kid.

92
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,030
He was his main spine guy and he
was doing great or great with them.

93
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,720
I actually thought Bj did very
well in the first two minutes.

94
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,700
The difference between what [inaudible]
does and Alex does is Alex is strikes

95
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,200
they the, they come and high volume,
interesting angles. He's very creative,

96
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,690
but they're not instantaneous and lethal.

97
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,900
The ear can fuck you up with one shot
and street kicker in MMA history.

98
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:48,460
You know what?
You got to send him,

99
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:51,880
you got to see him against a worldclass
moy targets. That's what you got to see.

100
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,680
Cause right now we don't
see him. No, no, no.

101
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:57,760
I'm seeing greatest of all time
and every now and then picks up

102
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,490
every now and then someone that's one
of those comfortable kicks every now and

103
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,710
then he'd lines multiple.
Every fight

104
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,000
jet leak kicks that he or his landing,
nobody else's landing chippy kicks.

105
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,090
He was doing that. J pen always fights
from a boxing distance in a lot of ways.

106
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:20,160
Who Styles Taylormade. He's
an older guy. He hasn't fun.

107
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,940
Two plus years before that, he got
work by Frankie Edgar. So you're,

108
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:27,860
you're talking about a Bj Penn has been
seriously out of the loop for a long

109
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:32,750
time and then he steps in there against
this fucking Bandolero do throw in three

110
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,910
60 round cakes.
I mean his style,

111
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:39,911
like it was almost like everything was
Taylor suited for Yahya Rodriguez for my

112
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:42,350
fighters and recommending I'm talking,

113
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,860
I told a couple of them they should
start just doing a local Sunday taekwondo

114
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:53,450
class once a week just to get the
spins tap, you know, it works.

115
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,420
We know it's effective.
Look, yeah, years proven it.

116
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,510
Every end of the main fighter out there
should be emulating Yahya. Yeah, I agree.

117
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,750
I think the days of coming out,

118
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,940
and of course I don't know
anything about striking,

119
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:07,880
but the days of coming out and just boxing
and throwing a leg kick every now and

120
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,400
then, I think that's, that's not
going to work. You're not gonna.

121
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:14,270
It's not gonna work against a
guy like Jon Jones Gregor. You,

122
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,920
you see these guys throwing all those
Taekwondo Kung Fu kicks successfully.

123
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,620
If you're an MMA fighter up there,
you coming up,

124
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,400
I think you should start taking
taekwondo now. That's a new point,

125
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,200
but I think if you watch glory,

126
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,390
there's a good fight that I talked
about recently because I got Joseph

127
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,220
Valtellina on it. Used to be good judge.
He's wicked, wicked kickboxing champion.

128
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,560
Really good guy too. But anyway,
he fought Raymond Daniels.

129
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,730
He's one of the best at
throwing those wild, crazy fun
Leroy. It's like a god man.

130
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,470
Me Means what?

131
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,150
What I'm Raymond Daniels did inside
the octagon or inside the glory ring.

132
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:51,230
He threw a flying side, kick touch
the dude and then spinning back,

133
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,970
kicked him in the air in the face.
Oh yeah.

134
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,980
Yo Raymond Daniels is a wild motherfucker.
But anyway,

135
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:01,820
Matrix Valtellina so you would see him
just doing the same kind of stuff that

136
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,520
Yahya Rodriguez does. He would say, oh
my God, if this guy gets in the UFC,

137
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:08,550
he's gonna fuck everybody up.
But Joseph optoline just chopped him down,

138
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,610
shopped in Beshar t pressure, really
strong physical guy, high guard,

139
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,470
super tight defense, and just kept
kicking the fuck out of his legs.

140
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,760
And then he finally head taekwondo
mix. No, I totally agree with you.

141
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:27,440
But I'm saying is we need to see a year
against a guy like a Niki hold skin or a

142
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,260
guy like, uh, like a
Joseph [inaudible] who's,

143
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,800
they have that super powerful
low kick fundamental game.

144
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:36,850
And we don't have a lot of guys that are
that strong at that inside the octagon.

145
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,890
Yeah. I'm sorry. Joe would mutilate them.

146
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,180
Val and he would just rip it now I MMA
they kickbox shows way larger than I am.

147
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:48,380
So it's not a good matchup. Technique
wise though. And fundamentals thoughts.

148
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,090
He's just on another level
when it comes to this. Kickbox
is leg. Yeah. Years. Yeah.

149
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,040
I'm really talking to kickbox
and we're only talking just

150
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,650
talking straight. Yeah, I get what
you're saying. But he's seeing it.

151
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:02,670
So when I get speech and speech,

152
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,590
but in MMA with an IBM taken down,
taken down,

153
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,913
you know what I mean?

154
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,230
So you could do wild shit and kickboxing
because there's no threat of getting

155
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:17,400
choked out. That's true. So I'm thinking,
but those guys are way better too.

156
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,200
They're way better at lake higher level.

157
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,410
The reason these things
in a real fight though,

158
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,620
that that's what I was saying
because he's doing it in a real site,

159
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,290
so he's better
taking it back.

160
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,050
Oh,
not enough time.

161
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,090
Oh, he's in great. He's
got enough time now.

162
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:43,010
He's pushing up on the Chin on the chin.
He should dance Evernham right there. Oh,

163
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,420
someone through a card in the
arts. Corsets. Dicks. Yeah,

164
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,500
so went through like a business card
in the octagon. I squared Daddy.

165
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,320
I think the reason you're seeing these
kicks work is cause guys weren't training

166
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:54,330
them.
If everybody's training the same shit,

167
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,110
you're supposed to do something different.
Everybody in the gym, the Training Jab,

168
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:01,410
cross, low kick, low kick, left hook.
They're doing all the same stuff.

169
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,420
If we all trained the same
stuff at our training,

170
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:06,270
partners train all the same stuff. We're
not prepared for different stuff too.

171
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:10,570
The thing is, yeah, you could
do the other shit too. Yes,

172
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,360
he's very good. He's very good at
scrambling. I think he's a pro bono,

173
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,950
but I think he's purple.
Rambling wrestling would be an issue,

174
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,960
but what I'm saying is
his Moitai is good too.

175
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,800
Like he's got a real strong leg kick
fundamentals. He throws good elbows.

176
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:28,710
He throws wild shit now
in that Bj Penn fight,

177
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,840
if they got in like an instant rematch,
like in another dimension, hopefully not.

178
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,290
But yeah. What would be
pulling guard might be, Oh

179
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,170
yes, because we already saw
shit. We took a glimpse.

180
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:45,660
He couldn't take them down with
straight rustling. Always try it.

181
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:47,470
First option should be tried to take him,

182
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,610
take him down with straight wrestling
passes, guard, get on top mount,

183
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,520
take us back. But if you can't take
the guy down and he's beaten you up,

184
00:10:55,521 --> 00:11:00,070
stand, what else are
you going to do? Bj, Bj,

185
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,820
Bj got on him.
There's an art to pulling guard.

186
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,930
It's just like a take down but
don't just sit on your butt.

187
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,990
It's also a shoot deep enough to make
him sprawl and come up with a lot of Paul

188
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:12,960
Paul.

189
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,670
He shoots and then now you got something,

190
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,650
but what you're describing is different.
Again,

191
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,160
it's what not the norm of what everybody's
training and that's why it's a great

192
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:27,870
idea. I call it the third option.
In that case, pulling guard,

193
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,420
especially BJ's a world champion black
belt, he should have a guard. Crazy

194
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,010
taps. Anybody off of his back. BJ would
always sweep. God's always mountain,

195
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:42,260
take the back trying to pull guard,
sweep and get a shower.

196
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,040
It's just interesting that he never
tapped her on the numbers number.

197
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,910
Nogueira versus Tim Silvia get
swept them wanting to take him down.

198
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,420
Couldn't take him down. Tim was, was
fucking him up with that Long Jab.

199
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,680
What are Nogueira do?

200
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,260
He shot for a week as single and then
pull guard and we'll have time. Yeah.

201
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,170
Pull that off guard. Yeah.
Miguel Suarez. Anyway,

202
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,630
it was a trick he pulled and then he
did it again. Deep have sweet. Yep.

203
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,300
Got On top and guillotine. Yup. Miguel
Torres over and over with the Matrix.

204
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:16,020
Johnson. Yeah. People think pulling
guard, I mean is is uh, you bait.

205
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:20,590
It's like admitting you lost the war.
Eagles like committing suicide.

206
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,440
But if it was committing suicide for
real people, think pulling guard.

207
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:25,030
You're going, you're going
to get killed. Pulling guard.

208
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,510
How come it's so hard to do. How come
when Vinny Maga less sits on his ass?

209
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,580
People, his opponent got know you stand
up. Suicide. He's letting you get on town.

210
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,810
Awesome stuff, man. No, it's on top.

211
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,830
He broke that into two under hooks.

212
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,790
Hooks in. He go straight to the
body line and it's such a look like,

213
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,890
oh, the fence fucked them. Wow. I was
fuck he couldn't arch and sink it in.

214
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,690
That's a bad place to be.

215
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,390
Sub Two punches to sub to punch us to
sub to pile because it's a terrible

216
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:07,330
position to be in. We got fucking
body trying to squeezing down your Ab.

217
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,260
This guy is a specialist on that body
triangle and right here in the old days,

218
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,380
this would be over already
when they allowed pointed,

219
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:17,580
pointed elbows to the back
of the head dancer. Tap Acts.

220
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,990
We've talked about this so many times,

221
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:23,530
but I really do want to study on what
kind of damaged it happens when you elbow

222
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:26,080
someone in the back of the head and why
is it illegal to have to look at the

223
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,230
guys back in the battle. Caden,
remember John Lewis it to somebody?

224
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,530
He landed like three.
Does your taste strikers?

225
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,780
They're the judo guy. Yeah. Remember
that? I remember thinking, man,

226
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:41,020
that's going to kill the rear naked choke.
No one needs a rear naked choke.

227
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,800
Someone's post in it's old heavy hips.
Yeah. You don't need a rear naked choke.

228
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,100
Can you do elbow or no, just
open hand in. You're in the

229
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,980
same target is how are you going to stop
someone from that by following through

230
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:59,590
with that elbow. I know. I know

231
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,210
guys are finishing on the chin,

232
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,100
on the chin. You can't do with just
a straight cable over the chin.

233
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:16,240
If you sink it in deep.
Great defense by doing good like he is.

234
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,030
He's in the worst case scenario and
he's fighting and now he's got the law.

235
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,560
Don't you think that the hair,

236
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,660
like when it comes to gay
teens and things like that,

237
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,140
it's going to offer you just a touch
more friction and it's going to make it

238
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:30,790
harder to get out of stuff. Texture,
harder to get into. Yes. That too, right?

239
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,390
It's hair I get in the way of
sunchokes. I bet it would. Doris.

240
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,350
Right. By the way, speaking of the
hidden in the back of the head,

241
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,530
W I used to go somebody who got hit in
the back of the head and lost their taste

242
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:44,890
buds. He got hit once you can go
deaf. He could never taste together,

243
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,870
going to get hit with, with a punch
to the back of the head and he,

244
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:51,660
cause he's never taste
again. Eddie after. Uh,

245
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,390
so someone's body triangle in and
they take the other leg and extend.

246
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,020
You get the other foot underneath his leg.

247
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,710
Who's in a scenario?
I got the body lock here and this,

248
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,730
this other foot extending his foot.
The I'll show you right here.

249
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,450
Look over this foot. I've got the
body triangle. This foot here.

250
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,500
I've got behind this right here.
She hit him.

251
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,410
What's the bottom line of your,
yeah, that one. The white foot.

252
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,380
You'll see right there. Why is he hooking
that in there? Just sounded a control.

253
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,710
Oh he's just got them.
It's a matter of time.

254
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,790
That was too hard to keep
the level control leg.

255
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,070
This not under the knee extended legs.

256
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,810
You got the one leg that's controlling
and then that that instep is locked under.

257
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,100
Say if you got her on the right side,

258
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,720
you have the other one you
use as a butterfly and you
control the leg and if you

259
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,000
elevate his leg, it makes it way more
difficult for him to do one more step.

260
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,350
One more step he has to address.
Yeah. It's, it's also like

261
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,710
it takes away his mobility,
right? Yeah. Cause uh,

262
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,410
you want to get body triangle
in. Yeah. You want to have it on.

263
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,010
You want to have your opponent on his
side and you want the cinched park to be

264
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:07,400
on top. So he wants, he
wants it on the other side.

265
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,840
So That Butterfly Hook keeps your angle
like we're going to keep you right here

266
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:15,890
on the good side for me. Keeps you
where you want to be in right there.

267
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,360
You see that? Yeah. Yeah. Please do on
the wrong side here. But he doesn't care.

268
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,810
He's just, he's dealing with it cause it,
it puts a lot of pressure on your ankle.

269
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,930
It's not a good position to be. I
wonder if you could look, Eddie,

270
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:29,510
can you loosen up your ankle so
that that doesn't bother you?

271
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,810
Some people it doesn't. It
doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

272
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,580
After you do it for a while, you
stretch your, it doesn't matter.

273
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:38,240
You want the cinch to be on top.
But if it's on bottom,

274
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:41,000
sometimes you switch it. But he's
like, I'm just going to leave it there.

275
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,240
It doesn't really matter. There's
trains out of belters camp that's, yeah,

276
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,480
I think he's about this.
This is thing that, um,

277
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,800
that ballerinas do where they shove
their foot into like this like big rubber

278
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,390
strap and you know,

279
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:56,180
your foot normally wants to sit
like this is big rubber strap.

280
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,740
We'll bend it down so that your foot
is parallel with your shin bone.

281
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,490
It's amazing what the human body would
react and respond to and adapt to.

282
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,210
Its an amazing,

283
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,910
but if you could get that going
on then the fucking body triangle,

284
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:10,010
it wouldn't bother you at all.
Somebody use that defense.

285
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,900
Why are we watching a geico
commercial fuck all that. So powerful.

286
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,330
Now the people at hallmark.
Yeah,

287
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,230
we want to tell him how to
sync it up on the next one.

288
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,230
So we're fast forwarding Jason night.
Let's see what he has to says.

289
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,270
They can fast forward. Yeah. He's
not afraid to say some shit. Jamie.

290
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:33,880
We have somebody down here anyway.
I think it's always fresh.

291
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,440
Guys. Don't call someone out.
Oh, whoever they want to give me.

292
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,160
I know you dedicate this fight to

293
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,080
oh Brian stayed with it.
Is Tim Tebow.

294
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,920
His Dad just passed.
Oh he did.

295
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,560
Thank you so much.
His birthday's tomorrow and I know.

296
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,470
Thank you so much man.

297
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,890
Just died last year.
Five days ago.

298
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,540
Short amount of time.

299
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,460
Is there anybody out there that's NBC,
Sir?

300
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,990
Did you see that fight with him and

301
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,180
he'd be asking for that.

302
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,670
It was the craziest fights.
Kennedy.

303
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,370
Remember that night your boy Kelvin
fucked up. That was us together.

304
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,140
Do Ho choice.

305
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,000
Cub Swanson having like one of the
craziest fights of all time of all times.

306
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,540
It's beautiful.

307
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,290
Fucking slobber knocker
nuts and who one cop?

308
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,170
Yeah. Yeah. It was like a full
on slobber knocker man. Some kid,

309
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,520
best athlete in the building fence
asked cheese chase best calf for him.

310
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,570
[inaudible] he talking about my
friend got him to animal birth. Funny

311
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,890
Christian Mccaffrey at all. There were a
part of us dies. They take all our women,

312
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,710
the handsome guy,
they stop.

313
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,830
That's why the athlete in college
football running back, son, that's real.

314
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,520
What's this deck as Macquarie Best?

315
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:21,180
That's the best running back in
college football. Flat fullback. God,

316
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,210
no tailback no second Heisman breakdown
on that next week on home and 43 I know

317
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:31,680
and it cool. That's not cool. Come on,

318
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,920
Trump's president and we got white
fucking rabbit. Kill it. Impossible.

319
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,980
I don't believe it's possible
with all the new vitamins

320
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,730
and kids since they were babies.
His Dad was an NFL pro,

321
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:45,720
so that's where he gets it.

322
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,490
This Holly Holm Germain de Randamie fight
is not an easy fight for Holly Holm.

323
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,350
People don't realize this
is a tough fight for that.

324
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:54,840
Germain de Randamie is
undefeated and Moitai. She's,

325
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,660
she's got some preposterous fucking record
and there's like 46 or something like

326
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:06,510
that. Nunez already beat her. Yeah, in
MMA, but it's a hobby. It's a kickboxer.

327
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,750
The thing about it is like Holly's gonna
Strike with her. It's going to be great.

328
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:13,100
It's a dangerous fight. Holly takes
it down. Yeah, she matched mine.

329
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,920
She has some good insight. Trotsky's
big athletics. Well, going back,

330
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,440
I'll do this one. You got three in her.
Oh God. Damn. How are we going to sell it?

331
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:23,160
She knows that. Isn't it
crazy? The support so quick.

332
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,290
No one stays. You weren't
following along. She was in there.

333
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,840
I never worked with shoes in there.
Great. Great Person. Freaking freak.

334
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:33,360
It's crazy how this fucking
sport just chews people up.

335
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,540
You think you're on top and
then it's gone and it's over,

336
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,130
but the casual fan doesn't care.

337
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,560
That's why that paper you his cell
because the casual fan goes, oh,

338
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:42,690
that's the girl who worked Ronda Rousey.

339
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:47,010
That's the argument for Mcgregor
versus Floyd mates. Fucking happening.

340
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,073
It's happening.

341
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,420
It's going to have to see. So Mcgregor,
it held a press conference last night.

342
00:20:55,421 --> 00:21:00,280
Sold out arena. 5,000 tickets sold out
the on the Mikey was a fuck the UFC.

343
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,230
Fuck everything. He said, fuck boxing,
boxing and he goes, the next fight,

344
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,740
the next fight. Me Versus Floyd, he
was four. You get it, fucking done.

345
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,200
And then he goes, I'm going to
do it with or without the UFC.

346
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,660
And they told Dana that and he goes,
good luck with that.

347
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,130
Good luck getting that done without any
dead. He believes in with the Ali Act,

348
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,130
he can actually do it because
it's a different sport.

349
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,830
He has the money to hire the
lawyers to try it. Well it's,

350
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,510
it is an interesting argument
because it's not MMA boxing.

351
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:32,080
So if it's boxing it's not,
he doesn't have a conscious,

352
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:36,300
she should just promote it anyways and
work together with Floyd and say well but

353
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,420
it's not just with Floyd.

354
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,990
It's with McGregor promotions
now that he's got his own thing.

355
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,240
That's the key to promote
because they don't want it.

356
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:46,270
They don't want to have a third middleman
and Dana white cause you have Conor

357
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,200
McGregor promotions for me with it and
then the UFC and they don't want to give

358
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:52,750
the US Senate is going
to become what boxing is.

359
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,840
It's going to become that because it's
star driven like all things like music,

360
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,800
hey to comedy,
like everything.

361
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:03,490
It's going to stay star driven
and when it star driven like that,

362
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,430
guys like Connor who are legitimate stars,

363
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,700
they have the leverage and they're
going to manipulate that leverage.

364
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:11,710
They're going to utilize that leverage
and we're going to see what happened.

365
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:15,940
Especially right now, can just started.
We've ever had I a reality star driven,

366
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:18,220
but it is a reality. Why is
it, why do you hate that?

367
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,440
Because it's always been like
that in boxing. Well, right.

368
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,050
I mean that's how they make the
hundred million dollar paydays.

369
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,930
He's a purist and real
quick. Yeah, me too.

370
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,560
But I would love to see Conor was Floyd.
Rob, rob and I were talking about fights.

371
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,270
This dude said he's never seen a fight.
He doesn't lie. Every single fight.

372
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:38,050
I've hated a lot of fun. You'll
see Kimbo and Dada. Okay.

373
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:42,070
That you got right to it quick.
Right to the point.

374
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,350
That may be
some shitty fight,

375
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,160
fight, fight and he was like, I
liked it when guys are down on.

376
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,010
My stunt guys kept each other out there.

377
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,190
Gracie's last fight on Bella total
cable and we were talking about it.

378
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:00,420
I liked it too. This is what I
liked about that all bullshit aside.

379
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,980
How grace he fought a fucking killer.

380
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,320
I mean that guy knocked
out Joe Schilling twice.

381
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:07,720
You've knocked him out and kickboxing
and he knocked him out in MMA.

382
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,360
He's a fucking beast.
He's a very dangerous striker.

383
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:13,000
He's a very big guy
and he's fucking scary.

384
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,450
He's a blaster and how it
and did nothing. No, no, no.

385
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,750
He avoided getting knocked down.
I'm not talking about college.

386
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,700
I'm talking about your boy who's obese.
Didn't new math because he was scared.

387
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,670
He was scared to get strangled.

388
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,090
And what were you scared of is what
happened in the last minute of the last

389
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:31,300
round when Alex did take him
down past his garlic butter,

390
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:34,300
fucking mounted him and
had him in a bad spot.

391
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,910
Haluk was going to fuck him
up if that fight kept going,

392
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,740
if that was in the first
minute of the first round,

393
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,790
how might or fuel to do it?

394
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,150
If you hit the guy that was
entertaining your batch,

395
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,030
fuck, fuck, fuck.

396
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,990
And you hated Kim overs data that
was more entertaining than that.

397
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,200
I didn't hate him.
He was not a high level fight.

398
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,240
I hated the fact that people were watching
it on TV and both guys were severely

399
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,250
unconditioned. There were severely
out of shape like no, I didn't.

400
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,500
His heartbeat stopped. The hit to
true is that some of that is him,

401
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,720
but uh, no. I, when I think about it,
honestly I hated what the fight was about,

402
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:21,890
but I love to fight the dynamic of
what's happening between these two human

403
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:25,340
beings in combat. I mean dot.
On Kimbo. Yeah. Even that one,

404
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,610
the dynamic between them is
different than every other fight.

405
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:31,280
In their case it was Mike
because chosen Mike, Jamie,

406
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,980
there's my student out until the talk
was about, are you intrigued by the,

407
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,600
by the Conor Mcgregor Floyd Mayweather.

408
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:41,810
I said as if Conor McGregor could
actually box with Floyd Mayweather.

409
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,850
Mcgregor cannot box with Floyd Mayweather,

410
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,830
but Conor Mcgregor's what the only goal
that he could have the workable idea as

411
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:53,030
a backdoor hack. Something where being
unwilling to make it a boxing match.

412
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,710
He is fighting him with two hands.

413
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,390
But boxing is not the definition of
fighting with two hands. Find a hack,

414
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:03,290
find it back to her. What
would Tim Ferriss do if Tim,
if you said, hey Tim Ferris,

415
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,230
how, how'd he beat Floyd Mayweather with
a guy who has never pushed him off the

416
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:10,850
stand? You'd want someone else's
idea and regurgitate. Yeah.

417
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,650
Yeah. It's not that easy. No, it's not.

418
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:20,370
But Mcgregor has found
the disruptions. You, uh,

419
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,190
Uber is a disruption or Airbnb
is a disruption on the, on the,

420
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,880
on the hotel business.

421
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,140
Donald's trumps and disrupt using the
Tim Ferriss example of good reason why it

422
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:30,471
sucks.

423
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:35,360
It's because Tim did that whole show for
CNN where he did a bunch of different

424
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:38,710
things and learn quickly. And one of
them we tried to do is Jujitsu. Yeah.

425
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,170
Good luck with all that. Good luck.
Don't work like that. You know,

426
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:46,130
a guy who's been doing Jujitsu for 10
years can get drunk, stay up all night,

427
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,090
show up drunk and still play
with you like you're a baby.

428
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,550
He's name's Jon Jones and
Jon Jones. I Jon Jones, like,

429
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,670
I don't even think he's really
ranked in Jujitsu, all that.

430
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:59,660
He could tap black belts because it's
such a freak. But if John Jones wanted to,

431
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:02,870
he could do whatever he wanted. Yeah.
I mean, if they're the same size,

432
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,410
it doesn't matter. You can eat four months
is not going to get you there. But the,

433
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,610
the, the thought that I have is you
can't beat him in boxing. Right?

434
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,840
But what if you, there's some other
answer and the answer to that is, well,

435
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:18,260
and the hundred years we've seen
every answer, if you believe that,

436
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,380
if Mcgregor believes that he's fucked.
Well,

437
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,370
McQuaig rigor said that
was really interesting.

438
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:25,130
Yesterday in the press conference,
he said, look, if it was a fight,

439
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,670
it would be the easiest fight. Easy.
He goes, fuck UFC. Fuck boxing.

440
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,680
It's an actual fight. I'll fucking kill
him. It's a joke. He's right. He's right.

441
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:36,110
So we're going to limit it to hands
and you playing a little game. Okay,

442
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,940
let's do it. Yeah. And that's,

443
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,950
that's interesting there
because that plays to the ego.

444
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:42,050
And he's the only guy that could
ever say that to Floyd. No.

445
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:45,810
Floyd's everyone faced Floyd's ever,
never fasted guy. It says, listen,

446
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,450
this is not even a fight. This is
a boxing match. You want to fight,

447
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:51,690
I will fuck you up any day of the week.
Wake me up,

448
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,620
wake me up and say you want to do it, I'll
fucking kill you. Yeah. And that's true.

449
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:00,480
There's also quite a bit bigger, quite
in fast, and you have to be different.

450
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,340
If you go in and try to box him,

451
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,150
you have to strike with him in some way
that is different. What that answer is,

452
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,920
I don't know. Angles and the May gloves.
Well, people remember that Donna,

453
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:14,790
my Donna, who is super unconventional,
really wild and reckless.

454
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:17,740
My Donald was 12 rounds twice with a home,
you know?

455
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,800
And so Floyd is not knocking guys dead.

456
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,660
He's not like he's [inaudible]
Golovkin in people or Cov 11 people.

457
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,520
You know, it's a totally
different kind of experience.

458
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:31,521
What Ford does is minimize any offense
and maximize his potential to put offense

459
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,810
on you. And he's a genius at it. And
if, if his output super low is cause,

460
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:39,240
that's what he can get away with.
And if his output is super high,

461
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,120
it's because he's got you. Yup. You
know what I mean? He's a genius.

462
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:44,350
If Floyd Mayweather,
genius boxing genius. Yeah.

463
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,670
That's why you can't beat them and less
there's some answer that doesn't yet

464
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:48,800
exist that condoms aren't,

465
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:51,080
could go and then just do the
trucial box and sit in front.

466
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:55,470
And that's not people who think that it's
crazy other here's the other fucking x

467
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:58,200
factor and it's a real factor and
it happens in every goddamn sport.

468
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:02,910
Guys get old overnight and Floyd
Mayweather is 30 what? 39 years old now.

469
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,700
39 years old at 40 by the
time this fight happens,

470
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,430
I mean some guys it takes longer.
Some guys it's shorter.

471
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:12,030
Bernard Hopkins managed to get deep into
his forties and still be world class

472
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,280
and he hasn't taken much punishment.
That doesn't get hit. No,

473
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,930
I'll only really been tagged
by Mosley and my Donna.

474
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,220
Those are guys are really tagged them.

475
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:23,680
And then earlier in his career he got hit
a few times. Yup. Yeah. But mostly sat.

476
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,470
He, he, you know, he sat them down,

477
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:30,640
mostly wobbled and then one
shot dominated. Yup. Yeah. He's,

478
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:35,010
he's a genius. He really ingenious.
And if it go as it goes on,

479
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,700
if McGregor becomes predictive of,

480
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:40,770
so say this happens and he
becomes a predictable in any way,

481
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,100
even the ways that he doesn't understand
that flight will read and it just gets

482
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:48,090
worse as the fight goes on. He'll get
out. So somebody comes to you and says,

483
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,110
this is happening.

484
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:52,260
You're going to make $200 million for
whatever crazy amount of money you're

485
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:56,340
gonna make a, how do we do it? And
the answer is you have to be very,

486
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:59,790
very different. You have to move
away from, from Floyd for sure.

487
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:02,940
You have to move away from him and draw
him in and you gotta be different almost

488
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,330
every round. You've got to have a
strategy that makes you unpredictable.

489
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,510
And even then you have to
hit somebody who's never hit.

490
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,710
So what I'm saying it and boy tied dumps,
I'm saying anything.

491
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,450
He ties him up fucking leg.

492
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,770
Let's give them something to think about.
Touching the ground

493
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,040
rules. Definitely. If he could,
you know, just one or two times.

494
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,470
If they get in the clinch and there's
some shit talking [inaudible] he just

495
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:31,800
decides to dump them and you see
Floyd's feet go flying up in the air.

496
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,370
Why is a small man choice?

497
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,220
What would you rather see them and it
just a straight boxing match with boxing

498
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:40,810
gloves or a boxing match with MMA glove

499
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,870
would want to do a boxing class all
day to make gloves or the big love.

500
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,540
He would want the big lifts
account events for default,

501
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,920
which is very important because it's
really hard to get because like it's a

502
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:56,890
whole different game when you're
getting around those little gloves.

503
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,880
Pink Floyd to go damn. What the Middle
Ground Dan's, his hands break a lot.

504
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,220
Great Tire lifetime. You have developed
your style around the size of the Mitt.

505
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah. You can't change your
front gate. I can sit, hey Floyd,

506
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,730
Connor's given up so
goddamn much get thrown

507
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,500
in the business. They given
you any so weird though.

508
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,210
Get an MMA best boxer.

509
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,850
Everything about his experience and his
sensitivity is around his whole lifetime

510
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:29,170
being built with this exact thing.

511
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,920
Sometimes he catches things in small
little details and another factor is the

512
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:34,300
speed of the incoming shots.

513
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,710
It's going to be much faster when
you're dealing with four ounce gold.

514
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,730
There's guys in worldclass boxing,
they're fast as fuck, right,

515
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,820
but they'd be faster if they have four
ounce gloves on it. It's just a fact.

516
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,740
It's just a fact of physics and he,

517
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:48,130
that speed almost might be
indistinguishable to us,

518
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,370
but to a fighter it might
be the difference between
getting hit by something and

519
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:55,390
not getting hit by something and you would
have to re gauge your distance meter.

520
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,650
Yeah. Different pitchers throwing
different speed balls. Every hitter,

521
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,150
this mother fucker and Ghana, no man.
I've been calling his fights for awhile.

522
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,540
When that guy walks into the cage,
it sounds different.

523
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,210
She is hand next to stands to the 56 dude.

524
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:14,800
He makes me look a little tiny person
and he can keep it in his pocket.

525
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,920
He's huge, man. He's
not small. No, no, no.

526
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:22,270
He's a big dude and he's just
solid as a rock man. He's,

527
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,840
he's French. He's French.
Oh, Nigeria. Yeah.

528
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,000
And he's just a super athlete man.

529
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,150
They think he's the next strike
the next big thing. Well, you know,

530
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:37,540
we've yet to see him against a really good
wrestler. We've yet to, I wouldn't eat,

531
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,910
I don't say anybody's next week
thing until they go with Kane.

532
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,320
You gotta go again. Healthy
came pressure. Travis,

533
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:46,360
you see what he did to Rothwell?
He just does.

534
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:51,310
He gets his face and your chest and just
when he gets past all your bullshit and

535
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:53,980
then puts it to you with a
pace that you just can't take.

536
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,120
The real question with Kane is, can he
still do that? He's had so many injuries.

537
00:31:58,121 --> 00:32:01,180
They pulled him off of his last
fight because he's got stenosis,

538
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:05,710
so it's fucking spinal column is shrinking
and they have to open them up and say,

539
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:10,320
no, no nerve steep pavers. JDS. Now
that is what the next step of fighters,

540
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:15,280
steep pace. Legit. That's
real. I know. Who wins now,

541
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,690
Steve Bay jds because ain't nothing.

542
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,660
You'd like to see him fight
again? Hosanna. Hosanna,

543
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,160
quack, quack, quack, quack. I
don't want to, I know hands please.

544
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,320
One thing about me is I take my MMA. I
would, I would have said the same thing.

545
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,620
You like MMA? I do, Dude.
It's like secret garden.

546
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,020
I said, well, I'm a combat. I'm a combat.
Well, I'm a sportsman as you guys know,

547
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,380
and I like to get up close and personal
and impose my will on another man in

548
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:52,490
Gannon was feet looked different too.
They like thicker. Like his heels.

549
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,950
Is he six five giant, giant.
When Randy Randy fought

550
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,403
Brock Lesnar,

551
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:04,250
he said that the distance
was hard to gauge because
this proportion was so weird.

552
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,950
So you can't actually,
he's got an enormous reach.

553
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,520
And when your body shape is different
like that, it tricks the eye. The way,

554
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,440
when you look down the Strip in Vegas,

555
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:15,020
you can't tell how close and
far away those hotels are. Yeah.

556
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:18,480
The God that looks way bigger than
Mr Alaska who's good to 40 well,

557
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:21,770
the thing about in Ghana, who
is, he's a natural size to like,

558
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,600
that's a big gentlemen. God is. That's
just who he is. He's a giant dude shop.

559
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:30,810
You fuck guys this big. I thought you just
said shop. Have you fucked us? He did.

560
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,990
Answer is yes. Yes, yes.
When? When? Necessary.

561
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,580
Only to correct that. That's only
when it rains. No Man. Our lost keys.

562
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:44,930
Only 37 isn't that crazy? That's a lot
of my, maybe years at tortoise though,

563
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,620
but that's crazy because inboxes,
but he's got a right there.

564
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,360
He's, he's running at him
and throwing punches too,

565
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,820
but he comes in behind that
double right hand all the time.

566
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:59,390
You can see it coming now. Yeah. He
looks scary. It's foot work. Yeah.

567
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,760
He is very much improved.
He wants to teach.

568
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,270
Trying to draw him forward. Imagine him
with, yeah. Your style kicking. Well,

569
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:13,250
he's awesome. No, that's
common. Spooky. Yikes.

570
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,830
Protect them. There was had overhead.
Our Lawsky with the overhand right.

571
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:19,130
He had just twice the Debra cuts.
What did him in,

572
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:23,060
I think our last lives you read
our laps gets overhead, right.

573
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,680
As soon as that overhand right is there.

574
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,350
This has done to tell him to stop with
the lightening bolts in the hair. Do.

575
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,810
Should we do it now? Should we do it
online? How it is in France though.

576
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,730
Weird shit and he's
just dominating bitches.

577
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,360
So I watch it when we see the replay.
Our he's overhand, right? Was the,

578
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,280
was the towel.
He called it too.

579
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,620
He said he's going to knock them out
on the first round. Is that a lot?

580
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,360
Press Steven then?
Well the last time is for Travis Brown.

581
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,310
I mean you gotta think are lost.

582
00:34:51,311 --> 00:34:53,390
You just knocked out Travis
Brown a couple of fights ago.

583
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,280
He's lost his last three though.

584
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,540
Now you can watch the right hand off of
our loss. Keith, the overhand right there.

585
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,210
Now you got them cause you know
what it is. Boom right behind me.

586
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,190
Look where it's head position.
Head position is,

587
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:11,030
he knew exactly what was coming and he
lifted him off the ground with that upper

588
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,183
core

589
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,840
physician that is fucking view to fall.
He planned,

590
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,220
he knew it was coming
with the overhand rights.

591
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,620
Conor Mcgregor Shit actually Nate Diaz
does that. The Diaz brothers to that slip,

592
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,210
they use their right hand, the
front hand. Once the front end,

593
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:33,220
the Diaz brothers throw that
hook from from south like that.

594
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,040
It's almost like a check. Yeah.
You draw a slide out. It's a head

595
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,110
position is key.
And then he'd come back over top.

596
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,760
Isn't that was by design so important
that a referee know how hard a guy hits.

597
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:48,900
Yeah. Because no one's complaining about
that. Stop it. No. But in other fights,

598
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,150
that would have been a stoppage
where people were and what the fuck?

599
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,800
You only took a couple shots,
but he's down.

600
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,220
Give him a chance to recover and not
with the Datto you like. No, no, no.

601
00:35:56,221 --> 00:36:01,060
That's good. That's good. It's good.
Yeah. Probably hear the impact. Oh yeah,

602
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,760
for sure. See him fight like a Rothwell
where that shot doesn't put them down.

603
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,400
He just keeps coming through a little
beard and like put square that one time

604
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:12,200
and stuff. That's, that's the, maybe
it does. We don't know because he's,

605
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:15,160
he's beat up basically cans.
Thank. Give him our Lawsky right.

606
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:17,820
And just merge here
now. Well, you remember,

607
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,510
do you remember when Ben Rothwell fought
Arlovski and I lost you fucked him up.

608
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,750
Yeah. Yeah. I mean that was our
labs scheme when he was in his,

609
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,380
well not even in his prime. He was a
little slipped. That's the fiction.

610
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,550
It was a little past his prime.
Yeah. You know I lost keys.

611
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,480
Prime was when he was in his twenties
he went on a Rah Rah run in the UFC one

612
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:40,440
fight away from a heavyweight title
match. What, two years ago? Two years ago,

613
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,760
but do you remember when he was young?

614
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,730
I remember when he starts Paul Bunch
off one punch. He's my favorite.

615
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:48,300
He had a right hand that was like a piston
dude and it's almost like now you can

616
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:51,420
see the wear and tear on his
shoulders when he's throwing punches,

617
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,910
like he throws punches differently now.

618
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,960
Back then everything was just
laser beam straight. Remember,

619
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,710
remember when you went to wildcard and
was just working with Freddie Roach and

620
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,250
tall and just getting knocked the
fuck out left? Well, not to Jackson,

621
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,470
but he was doing well after a freight
train with Freddie Roach who is doing

622
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:10,560
really well against fader or,
and then he just, he panicked.

623
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:15,120
He was lighting him up. He was doing well
and they did a flying knee and failed.

624
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,100
I was like,
what the fuck man?

625
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:21,870
Best timing in the game with his right
hand. Like it was just deceptive.

626
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:26,340
How about Israel coming up in like
two weeks, right on spike. Yeah.

627
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:30,660
That's weird. I just feel bummed out that
we never got to see fade or in the UFC.

628
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:33,190
I still feel, feel, feel
bummed out. There's up.

629
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,980
There's an empty hole in my heart
for that one is not at his best idea.

630
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,010
It'd be cool to see him, you know,
passion melded. Dano fight that he had.

631
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,800
Yes.
Maldonado fucked him up.

632
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,640
I watched that like this and it'll
make you sick to your stomach.

633
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,500
Should have got the you, Oh, you know
the commission turned it. Yeah, they did.

634
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,360
I think to a no contest and look that
up Jamie. I might be batshit crazy.

635
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,590
I think they switched it to only one side.

636
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:05,460
He got a no contest. Russia was like,
all right. Yeah, we fucked up. Wow.

637
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:08,970
That's when you know you
got jobbed Russia, Russia.

638
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,850
They're like enough. Wow. This guy.
But you know that when you heard

639
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,470
school like our Lawsky did,
they're like these young guys.

640
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,230
You guys can just talk to each other.
Put your headphones on. Brian Cowen,

641
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:24,990
you're on the microphone is a podcast.
We've talked about this before.

642
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:28,330
You son of a bitch. Does he cough?
What does he call me without here?

643
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,960
Does does friends. Connie went out
now man, I ain't even heard it.

644
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,990
Zero English haunting. You
hate American dollars. Cranky.

645
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,040
Look. Yeah. Fatal Arts
victory over time. This

646
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,443
girl,

647
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,093
he's trying.

648
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,283
Sorry.

649
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,030
Oh that's not bad at all.
Good for him man.

650
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,490
You're giving me some Nice Alon
Soufriere more former job and then

651
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,540
I'm very happy to win the fight.

652
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,780
He's saying he wants big fights. I'm
very [inaudible]. Me a former champ.

653
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,900
I'm a believer in a mouth that was
pure scale of this position coming off.

654
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,970
Yeah, draw, draw back and
where your head is in space.

655
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:18,720
It's just the one and he'd take it
off the shoulder did. He's terrifying.

656
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,850
He is the most terrifying
heading in a long time.

657
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:26,670
Read that Shit coming from 20 miles away
and the right hand combo is part of it.

658
00:39:26,671 --> 00:39:31,380
So it's a, it's designed
to play wrestling, I guess.

659
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:34,500
His wrestling's pretty BC. They say,
you know, granted it's the French,

660
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,040
but he trains with the Olympic wrestling
team and he can't get his ass down.

661
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,480
Well also the judo team,
he's, they're bringing in all
sorts of really high level.

662
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,020
Yeah.
The size of his hands.

663
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,230
They're saying they're bringing in a
bunch of different Olympic level athletes

664
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:53,630
to work with this guy. I mean
he's a real prospect, prospect.

665
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,610
Prospect in a long time.
Skeptical.

666
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:58,790
Hippalands I'm not a believer
after knocked him out.

667
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,240
That was a skill when that was
designed, play off and overhand. Right.

668
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:07,340
Planned shot up and it's right there
and look at him every shot. A shot.

669
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,600
All right. Twitter. Prazole let's see.

670
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,860
I think people are crazy. Dad. One Point
Pena was the favorite. It's like, dude,

671
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,610
dude, the oddsmakers not, I don't know
who the fuck mate. Those on for a while.

672
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,270
Then the, the public was like, what the
fuck? And we're going to get money on it.

673
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,000
And then the favorite.
Nothing against Pena,

674
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:30,690
but you're looking at somebody
with 400 fights. Check, check,

675
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,220
got crazy fight.
She's got haunted bus,

676
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,720
kickboxing and boxing. Hundreds
of fights. She's so hard.

677
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:40,810
Dude just said,

678
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,180
Jack goes so hard to turn
down like a hard person.

679
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,990
She's a hard woman.
She's just rushing chick who loves guns.

680
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,440
I mean her nickname is bullet.
She has a contract to on her hip.

681
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,403
She has a

682
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,830
skill versus hard in this fight. Oh,
you guys are already told me one.

683
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,250
I haven't seen this fight.

684
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,650
You're going to love this fight.

685
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,500
This fight is going to be interested
by two desks. Bermudez coming up.

686
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:17,310
It's going to fight Korean
Zombie, dude. No, no, no, no.

687
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,500
Next weekend if I fucking

688
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,880
pulled out and see what
the fuck is going on.

689
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:29,190
The fifth fight fight that got canceled
for eating. Something's going on.

690
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:33,710
But the good news is, is two weeks for
the fight he might get a replacement,

691
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,120
so we'll see what they have to
find someone. Maybe it's hard, man.

692
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:41,690
Flyways it's not easy.
It's not easy to find a good flyway goods.

693
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,780
A different answer. Maybe there's some
young dude who's just waiting bike,

694
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,610
you know, waiting out
there. I'm sure there is.

695
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,970
If he get along as he can
make the weight man, you know,

696
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,770
like because New York isn't it? They
don't fuck around with riots in New York.

697
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,770
Yeah. If you fuck up with, uh,
the, the weight in New York,

698
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,980
like if you're over by a think it's
eight pounds, they won't let you fight.

699
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,770
That's fantastic. But, and
one of the cards that is fair,

700
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,680
I heard that it happened on one of
the cards. It was kind. That's right.

701
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,320
That's right. That's right.
That's why they pulled him.
Yeah. Yeah. Tim Kennedy. Yeah,

702
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,400
that's right. And Goddamn, he
erased everybody's anger about that.

703
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,190
Everybody was so mad about that destroy.
He's worried.

704
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,320
He's one of the guys that had a
taekwondo talk with and he goes, dude,

705
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,600
he pulls out video of this training
because I'm already doing this.

706
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:26,530
He had like a session where he's spinning
and just getting all that spins down.

707
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,630
He's on it.
Get them on that nutritionist son.

708
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,440
I think I want any five [inaudible] five.

709
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,130
He's fighting veto any lots of good,

710
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:41,300
funny to Woodley and just split
decision and he was exhausted as my guy,

711
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,660
Ron hit mass. Phenomenal.
He was he, I think 17 sorry,

712
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,850
but he was drained for
that fight. You know, he,

713
00:42:47,851 --> 00:42:49,190
he'd cut a ton of weight for that fight.

714
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,190
I don't like him at 70 I liked them at
85 you like your chance to become world

715
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:55,340
champion? 85 I think he could do it. I
think he just has to gain some muscle.

716
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,100
Nine he's Lik you said,

717
00:42:57,101 --> 00:43:01,130
put on some mass or figure out a way
to comfortably make one 70 and a much

718
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:04,430
healthier way for, he's not
draining himself. He can be champ.

719
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,330
He can be champ at one 70 the road
to one seventies easier. Oh look.

720
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,500
Everybody gets tired,
but he doesn't get tired.

721
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,080
That dude is still pumping
it out in the third round.

722
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,180
And when he was overwhelming
Kennedy and the third,

723
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:17,030
was it a second or third round? When
both smashed them second. Right.

724
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,890
Did you stop him in the
second or the third?

725
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:22,570
But it was just a second pace was
out of control. His footwork is,

726
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,550
but that's what I thought.
The big factor.

727
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:26,840
I thought there's two big
factors in that fight.

728
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:30,530
I thought one kit Tim is a big one,
any five, and he's super strong.

729
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,960
It's Jujitsu's real good.
If he gets Kelvin down,

730
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:34,550
he might be able to blanket
him and beat him up.

731
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,910
But when he started getting tired,
I was like,

732
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:41,180
he's going to have a real hard time
with Kelvin's footwork cause Kelvin's

733
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:43,850
footwork. He's nasty, he's real lie.

734
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:47,360
He bounces around and
he does a lot of faints.

735
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:51,320
He's not predictable and he
comes in behind that Long
Right Jab, he fucks you up,

736
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:55,970
man. He's a southpaw. Sneaky South Bach.
He comes up with his right jab sometimes.

737
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:59,840
Sometimes he comes in, he hooks you,
he digs. The body has grapplings good.

738
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:03,470
His Chin is made out of fucking granted.
He's a killer. Can Be tough to be,

739
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,290
have to.
Super Cool.

740
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Just sweetheart of a guy after he made
Kevin Swanson versus joy with him and he

741
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:16,700
was just having the time of his life.
He was not touched,

742
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,680
but I've talked to him rough night
for Tim puts in, made a big mistake.

743
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,770
He went from one camp straight into the
other camp and apparently he was very

744
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:28,190
flat and they were saying that he was
definitely overtrained like he just drove

745
00:44:28,191 --> 00:44:32,040
the chain. I just one foot in,
one foot out to these guys, got

746
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,500
to these new,
these new gen guys.

747
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:38,790
They just understand the space between
you better like they manipulate the space

748
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:41,580
between you and we just saw
it within Ghana, you know,

749
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:45,720
he just has a better understanding of the
space between you and his opponent and

750
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:49,140
how to use as the stand and bang phase.
That's shit's done.

751
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,110
That Standard Bank phase is done.
Yes. At a world class level,

752
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:55,530
standing bangs done and everybody
wants to be world class.

753
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:58,440
When you see guys like Conor
McGregor raising their fucking bar,

754
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,620
the new ones coming up
like the Eir Rodriguez,

755
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,400
like the fucking Cody Garbrandt who can
be next level and what are they doing?

756
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:08,850
They're moving like a mother starts
control moves. No Stan and bang.

757
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:13,110
It's calculated. Exchange is
calculated risk worldclass technique.

758
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,460
Everybody's accelerated,

759
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,270
everything is way higher and higher level
and then they're at this new level and

760
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:21,630
they're accelerating in their ability
to improve from that level. So it's,

761
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:25,620
it's like exponential and it's weird.
And then young guys coming up,

762
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:27,150
I commentated some fights between,

763
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:31,080
I was telling Brendan and 18 year old
named Tony Laramie and a 20 year old named

764
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:33,840
Keith Lee, Kevin Liezel,
a brother from Vegas,

765
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:37,860
they were both all window and
it was some high level shit,

766
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,480
high level,

767
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,220
the way that they played at distance
of the way that they manipulated the,

768
00:45:43,221 --> 00:45:47,730
the timing. It was fucking crazy,
uh, for Tko for a fight pass.

769
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,380
But Canada is getting,

770
00:45:49,381 --> 00:45:52,290
nothing is accelerating faster
than high level MMA right now.

771
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,600
If you go back 20 years ago
and look at a word is today,

772
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:55,920
there's not a sport in the world.

773
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,320
We see that much of a jump between 20
years ago and today new technology,

774
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,490
it's moving like technology. It's
evolving like exactly. The question is,

775
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,890
when are we going to see
a guy who kicks like yeah,

776
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,890
year and also has Joe Schilling style,
Moy Thai, and also can box like Cody,

777
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,570
10 years olds right now that
are bull lowing your mind.

778
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,120
And that's why when you
see a guy like yeah,

779
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:24,150
year and you see this next level
expression, you realize like, wow,

780
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:27,330
the horizon is going to be bananas.
We're going to see guys like, yeah,

781
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,930
you're fighting another guy like guy here
and we're just going to see chaos and

782
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:35,160
the level of performance, just their
abilities psychologically to fight.

783
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:36,720
And that's growing exponentially.

784
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:40,520
They're honors raising that
individually by himself. Yeah.

785
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:44,430
He's raising everyone's expectations
for how someone performs under pressure.

786
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,080
He steps in there against Josie Aldo
and fucking sleeps in 13 seconds and a

787
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:52,440
fight that he's been talking shit
about for a year for a straight,

788
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:56,100
solid year world tour talent.
Everybody's gonna fuck him up.

789
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,720
And he goes and starches him with one
punch in exactly the way that you knew if

790
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:02,190
he was going to do it drawing.

791
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,330
And that was a punch you had seen him
use and that strike he'd been using since

792
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,780
England in England and
Ireland before he ever,

793
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,260
he was landing that in
space drawing you forward.

794
00:47:13,261 --> 00:47:17,760
It's one of my favorite tweets ever that
I tweeted him in like 2013 as I'm a big

795
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:20,340
fan. I hope you get into
the UFC one day. Boom.

796
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,210
What fight in tweeted back was
it that got you into a man?

797
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,130
I watched a bunch of
his fights from England,

798
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,490
but it was a one fight
where he slid back and Kayo

799
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:34,000
this dude with his perfectly placed
lefthand. Yeah. And I was like,

800
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:36,520
this kid's got some fucking timing.

801
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,610
And the like for as a hobby
describes the touch of death. Yep.

802
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,590
Yup. No, when you got that kind of power,

803
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:46,500
you can see his body is built to
deliver that power, but it's technique.

804
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:48,110
It's clean.
It's awesome

805
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,370
thought. You know, he's, he's very, uh,

806
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,760
the way he's approaching
the game is very thoughtful.

807
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:59,761
He's thinking it through like getting
down with Ido port and just concentrating

808
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:03,370
on the ability to move your body
better. Yup. Just all you know,

809
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:05,320
across the board having
that kind of dexterity,

810
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:10,070
thank better, better movement. Absolutely.

811
00:48:10,071 --> 00:48:12,410
No you haven't. You're sticking with
that. I think it's all bullshit.

812
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,790
It's definitely not. Definitely
not bullshit. Bullshit.

813
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:20,090
I don't think it's bullshit.
I think it can help you,

814
00:48:20,091 --> 00:48:23,300
but you better have the foundation in
the skills of common Gregor before you

815
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:27,380
bring in a coach like that.
You cut other shit out.

816
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,870
Just talking about doing movement stuff.

817
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,700
I think it's very important
like gymnastic, gnostic,

818
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:35,510
not you're all the way those Brazilians
kicking at your head. That's real shit.

819
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,020
I see it in break dancing,

820
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:41,930
breakdancing as movement at the ultimate
movement drills and I see it personally

821
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:44,450
in Jujitsu.
All those guys from the freak show,

822
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,430
they all did you Jitsu and al got really
good, really quick. So it, yeah, it does

823
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,630
for the uninitiated is Richie and
Geo Martinez down in San Diego.

824
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:57,050
They're bad motherfuckers who are badass
break dancers who have turned into

825
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:57,471
Jujitsu,

826
00:48:57,471 --> 00:49:02,471
black belts who are out there marketing
people and they told me about it when

827
00:49:02,661 --> 00:49:05,220
these guys were white belts. He
told me about it. He's like, dude,

828
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:08,210
I've got these new guys are white
belts and they're phenomenal.

829
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:12,070
Like everybody knew it like right
away that they have this very huge,

830
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,910
very unusual ability. And you know what
man, you got to give it up to the band,

831
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,560
Hicks and Gracie cause he
figured it out before anybody.

832
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:22,400
You go back to those 1994
Hixon Gracie videos were,

833
00:49:22,401 --> 00:49:25,010
Hickson was in Santa Monica
standing on a balanced bar,

834
00:49:25,011 --> 00:49:29,110
stretching his leg overhead in a full
split. He was doing the rings. He was,

835
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:32,630
he was walking on his hands. He was
doing all those breathing exercises.

836
00:49:32,631 --> 00:49:37,040
He was down with Yoga and movement and
dexterity and flexibility before anybody.

837
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,370
By the way, this is my new favorite ball
time commercial is fucking commercial.

838
00:49:40,371 --> 00:49:41,280
Back this up a little bit.

839
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,080
This is Jamie gimme gimme some knowledge
or give me some, uh, some volume.

840
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:50,010
There's north haven [inaudible] second.
I lost the Kelly Clarkson.

841
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,770
There's a
tiny horse guy or get these ranchers.

842
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:02,220
He's got red hair.
Purple issue is you deserve this.

843
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,970
This was kind of,

844
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:16,520
commercials have gotten
crazier and crazier because
they have to cut through the

845
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,850
buck.
Buckaroos.

846
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:25,050
It's a tiny little dude who's flamboyantly
gay on a tiny little Wah Whitehorse.

847
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:32,220
He's got that. That's probably the third
one. That was the funny thing. Yeah.

848
00:50:32,221 --> 00:50:35,540
I got a gay as fuck buyer. It was
awesome. Not how that's not true.

849
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,880
Got a private prince guy. Yeah, you
might be. You might be right. Yeah.

850
00:50:38,881 --> 00:50:41,630
It fucks small girl like tiny.
You never know, but it's great.

851
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:43,310
Great God damn commercial.
Anyway,

852
00:50:43,311 --> 00:50:45,470
we'll fast forward to the shit
and get to the cowboy fight.

853
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,730
This fight is a fight that I felt
coming into this fight and give it away.

854
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,451
I'm not going to get,

855
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:52,850
I'm not going to give anything away
from saying coming into this fight.

856
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:56,630
I think that a lot of people don't
know how good Jorge Mas for dollars.

857
00:50:56,631 --> 00:51:00,410
So this is not a fight that
that many people are cause
he's scared, but no, no, no.

858
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,380
You can't do that, man. I want to
give him shit away. Yeah. Real,

859
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,880
super, super dangerous. So cowboy,

860
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:14,940
a lot of people would think this fight
wouldn't be as close as it's likely to be

861
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,710
stopped.
That

862
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:26,320
cowboy at one 70 is so much better than
cowboy 55 and he's one more example of

863
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:29,870
just like we talking about with Calvin
guys who don't cut weight and because of

864
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:32,510
that they look healthier. They're
like faster, like stronger.

865
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,230
They just think of more durable to,
they can, they can recover from stuff.

866
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:40,130
But the trade off of course is
at one 70 you know he's fighting.

867
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,230
If you fight like Tyron Woodley,
you fight,

868
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,010
you know you're finding someone hits
way fucking Harvey Lawler. Yeah.

869
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,140
Way fucking harder than anybody.
If 55 this guy is.

870
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,780
So it's really getting these skilled max.

871
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:52,520
He's relaxed instead of breakdown on him.

872
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:55,040
And I put in some of his
old backyard fights. Yeah.

873
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,130
But he used to have those backyard
fights back in the old Kimbo days.

874
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,670
Kimbo was in this corner for
[inaudible] bad mother fucker.

875
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:03,920
I can do that for a while.
It's got some knee issues.

876
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:06,080
So it's had some knee
issues for a long time. Man,

877
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,150
he's been hesitant usually
and a lot of his fights,

878
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:11,600
he always tends to always fucked up,
man. His knees are always fucked up.

879
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,130
He's trying to intimidate cowboy cause
everybody thinks that if you intimidate

880
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:20,150
cowboy to work in the Matt Brown fight.
No.

881
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,520
See everyone thinks that Matt Brown fight
was like a cake walk. That was a bit,

882
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,610
it's a bit of a flight. No, it
was definitely not a cakewalk.

883
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,930
Matt Brown and a cakewalk. No, no.
I'm saying people think cowboy.

884
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,190
I didn't think Kalbi look
that great in that fight.

885
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:39,080
I thought it was so real good.
Fight is a fight he looks at at all,

886
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:42,950
but he's fighting Matt fucking Brown.
Matt Brown is a Goddamn Barbarian.

887
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,790
He's a bar band. He lost what?
Five is less six. He's about Bam.

888
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,030
Take account shots then number 12
guy cause he doesn't give a fuck.

889
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,160
He wants to Denver.

890
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:55,470
He just knocked on Matt Brown six weeks
ago and he's like I want to fight in

891
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,750
Denver. Denver's his hometown. He did take
some punishment in that fight. He did.

892
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:01,820
He definitely took some punishment
and that Matt Brown fight,

893
00:53:01,821 --> 00:53:03,230
but this is what he loves to do man.

894
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,820
He loves to just get back after it and
he loves that story. He loves. He also,

895
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:11,750
the more he fights, the more comfortable
he is fighting. You know, like it more,

896
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:15,590
it becomes natural. He went to a concert
last night, the night before this

897
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,700
steel Mexico to Mexico in like the
middle of his campus and near the end.

898
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:26,210
Yeah, let's do that. I don't
know. He says it relaxes

899
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,280
him. I guess he did at one camp
in it. He had a great performance.

900
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,920
So he said that it relaxes. If your last
week is just sweating a lot anyways,

901
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,530
you can do it anywhere and
he does have to make weight.

902
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,000
He fights at one 75.

903
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:42,330
I mean he walks around at one 75 one
76 he's not cutting anything. No,

904
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:44,700
he looks great at something. He
can be. We'll shape it up at all.

905
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,020
Yeah, I agree. Uh, people
sinked up to this. Oh yeah.

906
00:53:48,021 --> 00:53:52,770
Four 40 74464405444 first round.
Thank you.

907
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,930
Thank you. Right? Yeah. This
is a real interesting, Ooh,

908
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,640
good stepping round kick to the body and
they'll switch kicks of his and nasty.

909
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,770
Yes. He's so good with
it. And he's also good,

910
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,580
like sneaking it up high out of nowhere,
which is what he did with Matt Brown.

911
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,190
He snuck that a switch
kick off the left leg.

912
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,110
That was a front leg
round kick to the face.

913
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:14,680
He knocked Matt Brown out with different,
their rhythms are,

914
00:54:14,681 --> 00:54:17,720
I see it as conflicting rhythms.
Well,

915
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:22,070
Mosbey doll is much more boxing
oriented in his, uh, his attack.

916
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,190
See, he's letting them know he's
trying to play on that a little bit.

917
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:28,020
You don't hear it. I have
watched this fight. You don't
hear it, but he's like, Ooh,

918
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:32,750
Ooh. Like is making sounds. He's trying
to give a cowboy novel experiences.

919
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:38,150
See, you can see is he is making
some noise. That's interesting.

920
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:41,480
I wonder if we would get pulled if
we had the sound in the background.

921
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:45,470
What would happen? Young Jamie Foxx.
Jack. Yes. It's Fox with Jack mean. Oh,

922
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:49,350
Fox Tel Fox. I'll come back.
I'll do a couple shows. Yeah,

923
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,950
that might do it. Just let me, let me
talk some shit about one or two of them.

924
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:00,300
Oh, right hand and a left turn.
It was so good. A mass mass,

925
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:03,730
all wants to stay in there long enough
to land the last punch and backed Donald

926
00:55:03,731 --> 00:55:06,590
up. And that's hard. He's
super tough hospital.

927
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,010
So tough to get Donald go back leg

928
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,620
thereby mosfet all is well.

929
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,090
He comes in and clean with that jab
and he also has a real nice high guard

930
00:55:16,091 --> 00:55:19,900
mosque. Ooh, he's, he's a
crafty fire man. Really?

931
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:21,640
Well-Schooled so smooth.

932
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,430
Like I like that inside leg
kick Donald throws me two dogs,

933
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:28,840
one of the best leg kickers in the,
in the sport for sure.

934
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,830
And Jorge has taken him. Dad's
here. It's like the hands. Oh,

935
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,610
not too worried about getting taken down.
He's so tall.

936
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,870
Like you fight scarring on his,
but when he engages in another strike,

937
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,740
like he probably has a, one of the most
head kicks to him and he's laughing.

938
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,270
Yeah.
Oh for sure.

939
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:53,550
He said he wants to be in there
till the end balls leg though.

940
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:58,320
Calvin eating that shit. Beautiful inside
leg kick there. Yeah. Oh I love that.

941
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,850
Little off time. Body fat. Oh,

942
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,130
we went to the bottom of there to
look at my dog eats it and comes back.

943
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,270
That was the question, right?
With the leg kicks. Well,

944
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:08,410
how's he going to deal with it?
We Sat,

945
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:12,310
he would counter off
them with punches and I,

946
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,930
his counters off the kicks are slightly
different to instead of sweeping the one

947
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:20,010
side and they're now using the typical
cat off that he'll go left hawk,

948
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,940
but he also just takes it. Yeah, he's
so aggressive. Tough. Yeah. It was so,

949
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:25,840
he's so like a,

950
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,670
the fact that he keeps closing
the distance in on cowboy
people don't understand

951
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,830
honestly walking down.
Yeah. No, he's very good.

952
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,520
Don't never have that breakout
when I don't mean to interrupt you.

953
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:38,050
You know what I'm saying?
Like he's never had that huge staple.

954
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,240
If you look at his lifestyle too,
I mean,

955
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:44,660
he really has had to concentrate and be
much more dedicated over the last couple

956
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,650
of years because before he used to play
a lot of video games and fuck off and

957
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:52,240
you know he was, yeah. It was like half
of the fun of watching his downtown.

958
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:57,060
I love that little food
to come forward that yeah.

959
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:02,080
Donald was to take time to got
good takedown defense, man.

960
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:04,810
That American top team is a fucking oh

961
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,960
yeah. Little bit. Yeah,
a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

962
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,250
You could see he's backing up a
little man, that Spinning Elbow,

963
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,340
but the jab is just nice.
That's switch kick off the left side.

964
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,030
That Donald throws is
so nice. Add, subtract.

965
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,510
Jorge's hands are down and they're knocked
down tonight. Man. He know he dead.

966
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,880
Serious lot of respect.
Just understands what it is.

967
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:35,140
Completely on that right side because
of that left high kick left hiking. Ooh,

968
00:57:35,141 --> 00:57:39,940
he's throwing overhand competitor.
Arlovski's it's hidden. Yeah.

969
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,550
Yeah. This is just expressed.
It's not throwing. Honestly,

970
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:45,260
when I look at her labs can move. I've
got to go back to this. Ooh, Nice.

971
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,280
I feel like our lab skis
shoulders are calm. Yeah.

972
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,670
Probably a lot of where I really tight.

973
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:55,180
He's throwing punches like he's throwing
him with his arms and jaw could only

974
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,940
take so many punches. Right. There's that.

975
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,960
Everyone's got a certain amount that
they're going to take and that's his check

976
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:03,700
who you tell him. Well, not
only that dude, when guys
take, oh, nice leg kick there.

977
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:07,570
When guys take a lot of
punishment, they're fucking
motor skills start going, bro.

978
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:12,070
Like they don't, they can't them up the
same way. That's her right there. Oh,

979
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:16,470
he got tagged there again. That runs about
starting to get loose. Oh Geez. Gotcha.

980
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,360
I always heard that. That hurt me.
He got flat footed there. Yeah.

981
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:28,190
It's all push and push Paul
or hey. Oh, strong kick.

982
00:58:28,191 --> 00:58:32,310
Take size on medicine.
Yep. Oh, he's out there.

983
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,060
He's out. That fights that, that
fight. All right. Nope. Nope. Nope.

984
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:42,190
End of the round and the round that's
fucking out. When have you, Joe, what?

985
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:43,400
Have you ever seen a rubber,

986
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:47,650
whenever you ever seen a ref at the
end of the round go like this? Yeah.

987
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,120
Like gets out. He might a
question himself. Mm. Yeah.

988
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,200
It's better off to just fight now.
Call. They should have it right there.

989
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:00,130
She ended the fight right there.
He looks out right there.

990
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,220
Once that calls over,

991
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,950
now it's up to the doctor and Greg's
just going to do his job here. He hadn't,

992
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,280
what Jackson is, was screaming at him,
you're not going to lose in Denver.

993
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,250
This is what I want for you head movement.
What are you going to do? Move my head.

994
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,570
You know, and that there, there was
a big pep talk here, but honestly,

995
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,590
you've got to wonder whether or not
it's the right move to send a guy out.

996
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,010
You don't know.
I mean you're

997
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,770
hopeful. You want them to recover. You
don't want them to lose by stoppage.

998
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,560
Let's take a look at it here.
Off the left to the boom and the right,

999
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,800
the top of the left hand behind it.
Let's, so he's in deep trouble here.

1000
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,590
He's out there, he's taking shots,
his eyes rolled back. Watch this,

1001
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,190
left her steps in.
Who kicked it?

1002
00:59:36,191 --> 00:59:39,530
He knew the kick was coming cause he
kicked the body. Boom, boom, boom man.

1003
00:59:39,531 --> 00:59:43,250
What a combination. Sam, Bam,
Bam, Bam, Bam. He sweeps,

1004
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:48,200
he sweeps the kick away
and it loads his left talk.

1005
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:52,490
Now do you feel that curb was stopping
the fight and then the bell rang and then

1006
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:56,900
he said, let's just keep it going. That's
the doc. I don't think he should be.

1007
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:59,590
It's on the dock.
I think it's not.

1008
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,420
It shouldn't be on the corner so much
or the fight of the fire's going to want

1009
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:06,860
to fight. We can't do this hard.
I smiled at him. I got you.

1010
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,610
What do you think the people would want?
They want blood.

1011
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,890
They don't give a fuck if
Kelly got over right there.

1012
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:16,280
A definitive that money on it. If you
have money on Mazda, you want that shit.

1013
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:19,850
Fuck all those people though. Fuck
those. Exactly. Think about the fighter.

1014
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,910
See Donald be a world champion.

1015
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,980
Wants him to take brain damage and
it's what's right. You know what is,

1016
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,800
what is the right thing to do?
So right now it's very hard to argue.

1017
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:35,180
That's the wrong thing to let them
fight because he's moving around and his

1018
01:00:35,181 --> 01:00:38,150
hands are up.
No compromise.

1019
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:44,330
You have to protect the fact again,
when I was fucking him up, man,

1020
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:49,190
oh my God. See Kelly jumped at garbage.
Tough. Goddamn. He got fucked up there.

1021
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:53,990
He's inviting the kick, kicking him to
try to get them to kick him to kick back.

1022
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:58,580
Don't kick the knee. He is. Oh, nice
kick. He's asking for Keck. Yeah.

1023
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:01,610
Did you see the way Donald's throwing
those punches? Those are purely defensive.

1024
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,150
He's just trying to keep him off and
then he goes for the cat home and tagged

1025
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,230
them again.
That's the end.

1026
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:12,100
You feel shop so tough
shots and that's it.

1027
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:15,800
Yeah, just stop. It's a bummer for
cowboy, man. That's a fucking bummer.

1028
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,460
He goes, you know what happened? Did he
just say, you know what would happen?

1029
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,160
Fuck you.
Say you know what happened?

1030
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,530
You know what happened then
when he said to him, yeah,

1031
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,420
he's a kid and they talked a lot of shit.

1032
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,540
And then when you mark the guy in his
own town, it's like, yeah, what's up man?

1033
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,360
Fucking told you that talk.
There's interesting,

1034
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:36,570
he's got those shells and the pink shirt.
Yeah, the doctor and he swears degree.

1035
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,460
Easy. Easy on the hands. I know that guy.

1036
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,480
He's very, he's doctor. He's just shocked
to see what he says here. Look at this.

1037
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,920
You know what happens? You
know what happened? Hold on,
give me some volume, Jamie.

1038
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:05,860
You it happened real
dark. Fuck that. Lose it.

1039
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:10,280
Lose that with a little
more gray is he beat Donald,

1040
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:13,280
talked to all that shit and then
when that happens and the guy goes,

1041
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:17,750
I fucking told you. Everyone goes,
oh, sore loser. It's a fight, man.

1042
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,210
He's cool,
nasty.

1043
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,540
And he just backed up. He's like, I
fucking told you that was going to happen.

1044
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,140
Maslow asked for this fight. He
was, I will fuck him up in Denver.

1045
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,960
He can be to anybody. He
literally can be. Then if he's on,

1046
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:32,910
if he brings his end game,

1047
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:36,630
he can cause this fight was made
after cowboys glass win, right?

1048
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,020
Mostly they'll say, I'll fight him
and then cowboy boots on Michael's.

1049
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,440
Let's do this dance in Denver.

1050
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:45,110
Sweets after fucking getting dropped by
Matt Brown, you got to protect myself.

1051
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,820
Watch how he launched the lefthand
right there below. It's tough for him.

1052
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,540
He loves it. I left high school and
this is a stoppage. This is the end.

1053
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,340
Got very fast. He got a one.
Most of it all is a monster.

1054
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:59,460
You gotta wonder it was the right call
to let them come out for that second

1055
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:03,150
round. Loaded hip. Yeah, right.
There we go. Good action.

1056
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:07,950
I know why they let it go. I want to see
more action. I as a coach though, Eddie,

1057
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,080
you shit. If that was Tony first
names, you shouldn't be saying

1058
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:16,740
you're a coach in real life
though. I want to see anyway.

1059
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,390
Mother Teresa,
look at this for a second.

1060
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:23,220
You'll see was Tony or Kelvin you with it?
No, no, no. Wait. Hurts. Stop this fight.

1061
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:26,080
Don't talk over and please I'm looking
at it so it'll just, it's time.

1062
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,140
Cause they were showing up.
I want to, I have a question.

1063
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,930
Why is he stopping him when he's
hitting the body? Cause he was,

1064
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:34,710
because he has nothing. He saw the
response when he touched the liver.

1065
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:38,280
You see his body just kind of
shut down right there and her may,

1066
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,360
he's a human being.

1067
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:43,950
So He's feeling questioning his decision
earlier anyway and if he sees the

1068
01:03:43,951 --> 01:03:45,720
chance he's going to take it.
Yeah,

1069
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,930
he knew it was a bad place
for cowboy right there.

1070
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:51,240
He was getting lit up
and it's easier to say,

1071
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:54,240
and you can be a couch quarterback
here. I think it's, he say, man,

1072
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:56,520
Donald shouldn't have fought this soon,
but honestly,

1073
01:03:56,521 --> 01:04:00,810
the Yoshi should not allow Donald to fight
six weeks after suffering brain Trump.

1074
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:04,200
No commission should have cleared them.
His coaches shouldn't allow. He wants to,

1075
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:08,370
and that's the cowboy way.
Cowboy losing number 12 guy in the world.

1076
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,030
How we can be world fucking champion.
Right?

1077
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,460
But you gotta you gotta he's a
thoroughbred man. Treat them like that.

1078
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:17,340
Don't let them do this wild shit.
It's a different game.

1079
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:20,310
Doing something that you would never
see a guy like Floyd Mayweather do,

1080
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:23,750
for example, or Connor or Connor
would never do that. Yeah.

1081
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,350
Fighting six weeks after a
war. It's his life. I get that.

1082
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:31,500
But also he's not making CanNor money.
He's not making Floyd money either.

1083
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:35,370
You know what I'm saying? He can do that
if he was world champion, right? Yeah.

1084
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,980
That's the argument. Right? He
needs to be protected from himself.

1085
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:40,750
He's too tough for his own good.
That's the case with a lot of warrior.

1086
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:45,300
I support these guys a choice to do
what they want to do. I was like,

1087
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:48,460
if a doctor says you can't fight,
then you don't fight a,

1088
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,090
if your family talks to you and gives
you advice and you'll want to take it,

1089
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,220
you don't have to take it.
You get to a free society we live in.

1090
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:56,760
You can eat as much sugar
and fat as you want to eat.

1091
01:04:56,761 --> 01:04:59,040
You can smoke as many
cigarettes as you want to smoke.

1092
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:03,060
You can do as much heroin and cocaine
until you at least until you have brain

1093
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:06,330
damage or you have brain trauma which
can cause you to be impulsive and make

1094
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:10,530
decisions that maybe you're not as part
of the game. That's what you signed up.

1095
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:13,360
What I'm saying is your team should
try to protect you from yourself.

1096
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,840
They would have stopped that fight of
Greg Jackson would have stopped it.

1097
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:17,130
Right there would have been,

1098
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,900
you're talking to a former fighter,

1099
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:24,880
Donald that could have like fucked the
relationship. I don't know. Maybe Donald,

1100
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:25,840
maybe Donald would have said,

1101
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:29,380
why the fuck did you stop that guy
in my bed all night, all weekend?

1102
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:34,000
You never know. You never know.
Stool. I think he was out on a stool.

1103
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:36,700
He looked like he was delirious.
I think he got hit.

1104
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:40,450
If we go back to that first round at the
end of that first round and he got hit

1105
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:44,860
fucking hard man.
He's a sit down down go,

1106
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:46,180
what do you want to do?
What do you want to do?

1107
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:49,930
Do you want to be known as the cowboy and
you were in a bar 20 years from now or

1108
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:52,750
like that guy fought everyone all
the time. That was awesome man.

1109
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,840
Or do you want to be known as a world
fucking champions stopped doing this.

1110
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:59,410
Hold on. You already said this but Eddie,
I think that what you're saying is true,

1111
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,900
but I think what you're saying is
true to what you're saying is true.

1112
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:03,250
His guys have come back from that,

1113
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,770
but what he's saying is guys
don't come back from that.

1114
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:09,220
If they take the kind of beating that
they took just six weeks ago and it's

1115
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:12,280
something that goes against kind of what
Donald's been saying because Donald's

1116
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,230
been saying that he doesn't
spar anymore and his camps.

1117
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,790
One of the reasons why
it isn't spar anymore.

1118
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,530
It's because he took too
much fucking punishment.

1119
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:19,360
He'd go into these fights
already damaged Donald.

1120
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:23,050
He does drills now cause there's almost
primarily drills and when he spars,

1121
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:25,720
he does it all. They do it like Thai
style. They're just touching each other.

1122
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,640
So he's working on his timing.
He knows how to fight already here.

1123
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,310
He knows he's tough.
There's no questions.

1124
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,770
So it's all just about getting your
timing and your endurance down.

1125
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:36,760
So I think you're right. Like guys have
come back from getting hit like that.

1126
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:40,540
Like Frankie Edgar against gray, her
came back to stopping a lot. Yeah,

1127
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,360
it's happening as much time.
But you're right. You're right.

1128
01:06:43,361 --> 01:06:48,280
But I think he's right too because I
think that that fight from six weeks ago

1129
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:52,600
that's, that was a war. It really
was. He was in a war with a killer.

1130
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:53,463
People forget that.

1131
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,770
We know because we see the highlight
him murking Matt Brown with a head kick

1132
01:06:56,771 --> 01:07:00,400
that's like before. How's it took a little
shy. He got dropped. He did get dropped.

1133
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:04,540
That's right. Good point. In
the end, whether you're his
coach or his best friend,

1134
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:07,930
you're his family member. You say what
you feel and then he's going to decide.

1135
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:11,500
See, I don't, I don't agree with that.
Well, let's talk. His coaches should go.

1136
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:13,690
We listen.
We know you want to fight til the death,

1137
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:17,530
but the logical thing is don't fight
in Denver against the number 15 guy.

1138
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,980
Let's wait. Let's fight the number
four guy and then you get a title shot.

1139
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,430
Let's do that. I agree with you. That
would be the most intelligent thing to do,

1140
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,410
but it's a big fight coming up in Denver.

1141
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,200
If cowboy did get a fight
against a guy who could,

1142
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:33,850
when he could beat and he
did win in Denver, he would
have been a hero, right? Oh,

1143
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:37,510
he's already a hero. I honestly think
that he wanted to feel the goal.

1144
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,710
He wanted to feel it again
at one 70 it's different.

1145
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:45,160
He's fighting number 14 one 70 cause
he's new to one strike number five.

1146
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,820
It's crazy. [inaudible] 70 in the world.
He's pretty close to a title shot.

1147
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,400
I will say this though,

1148
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:56,650
the upside to being a UFC champion or a
fight or the upside is the most amazing

1149
01:07:57,731 --> 01:08:01,550
feeling of getting your hands right,
knocking someone out in the octagon,

1150
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:06,220
payscale to know that it's, it's the,
it's the upside that it's the greatest.

1151
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,930
I'm sure I've never fought, but I'm sure
when those guys, when Chuck Liddell wins,

1152
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,620
it's like you're the king of the
world in the UFC championship.

1153
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,790
That's the upside. You, you're
going to have a feeling that no,

1154
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,300
very few people taste.

1155
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:21,830
It's like ultimately quick Chuck Odell
throw his arms back. The ultimate look.

1156
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:26,180
The downside is there. Yeah,
man, there's a lot of risky shit.

1157
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:29,470
That's why the sport is so big because
it's so much risk for it will never grow.

1158
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,110
Everyone thinks that way.
We're going to be the sport to grow.

1159
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,060
It doesn't need it because guys
like Conor McGregor who's going,

1160
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,580
I'm not taking that fight. You know
what? I'm not doing that. You know what?

1161
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:41,341
I'm going to wait and do this.

1162
01:08:41,341 --> 01:08:45,290
They got big with doing the UFC program
and now he's beyond that and he's gone

1163
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:49,030
beyond that. But he's grown the sport.
I think at this point, you know,

1164
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,210
in the beginning of the UFC we
always had, uh, um, you know,

1165
01:08:53,211 --> 01:08:57,280
be careful how you, uh, explain the
fights and the rules and, and, and,

1166
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,280
and how everything was broken down. But
now it doesn't matter. The UFC so big,

1167
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:05,060
we don't have to like, oh look, we want
the sport to be huge. It's already huge.

1168
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:09,980
Right? It's on another
level though. Crazy level,

1169
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:14,270
man that's on Fox. I mean, it's
crazy. I kind of agree with Howard.

1170
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:18,230
The Conor McGregor is taking it to the
next level and it's going to go one level

1171
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:19,010
above that.

1172
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:22,340
I think it's going to continue to grow
and it's not by taking stupid fights and

1173
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:24,680
just never become Wilson
about being professional.

1174
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:28,790
And I think if you did look at it in a
professional manner, I agree with Brendan,

1175
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:32,210
but I also agree with Eddie. We're both
right, Brendan. Yeah, well there's no,

1176
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,790
there's no difference on your fighter
because here's the thing, he kind of,

1177
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,070
Gregor took the fight with Nate Diaz
on very fucking short notice. 11 days.

1178
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:43,190
It takes 11 days notice,
five fights at 70 you know,

1179
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:45,860
it doesn't cut any weight at all when
he's supposed to be fighting in 55 for the

1180
01:09:45,861 --> 01:09:49,790
title takes a giant chance
and winds up losing. Okay,

1181
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,500
so you're right and you're wrong.

1182
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,740
Like that's part of what made the legend
of Conor McGregor that he's willing to

1183
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:57,350
do something so fucking crazy.
But now he,

1184
01:09:57,351 --> 01:10:02,300
now he's in this stratospheric position
worries world while we're dads come up

1185
01:10:02,301 --> 01:10:05,420
to me and my fucking kids school and
they want to talk to me about that crazy

1186
01:10:05,421 --> 01:10:07,340
Irish guy, Tim. Yeah. Yeah.
They don't, they don't,

1187
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:09,050
no one wants to talk to anyone anymore.

1188
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,550
They don't know who the fuck
Francis and Gando is. They will,

1189
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,690
they will guarantee you Francis year,
fuck yeah, I bought that tonight.

1190
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,220
The heavyweights are always the scariest.

1191
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:21,650
You know that that kind
of scare market people.

1192
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:24,860
He keeps marketing people like that
emerge people get the personality.

1193
01:10:24,861 --> 01:10:26,990
Then he got some, he said
Tyson, he's got character.

1194
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:31,160
Never been allowed to come out to Chicago.
Then yes,

1195
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,940
I can name a few. I don't want to, I
want to see him screaming in French.

1196
01:10:34,941 --> 01:10:37,720
Stopped getting them to talk in English.
I want you to

1197
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:44,770
grab his cock and like bring it out,

1198
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,490
scream and throw it in the camera.
That is a super athlete.

1199
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:53,660
There was a rare,

1200
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:58,580
rare athlete with some serious
fucking ability and end mindset.

1201
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:03,170
He's got a destroyers mindset that guys
all the tools to be a world champion,

1202
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,830
but Kenny get by a guy like Cain

1203
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:11,900
saw was the right way.
Keynes going to try to impress you.

1204
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:14,090
It's at least it used always female double

1205
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:16,290
jab overhead. Right?
Still it's the right idea.

1206
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:19,470
You know he's coming towards you instead
of straight back and roll the shoulder

1207
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:22,580
out on an angle.
You still need to catch him coming in

1208
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,330
the concept.
You go back to Canaan fought Nogueira.

1209
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:31,530
There was no one like him at all
for just feeling his body just can't

1210
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:38,060
fuck. Are we talking about? Yeah, he
beat the fucking broke twice. Twice.

1211
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:39,850
Jd has never been the same.
Never been the same.

1212
01:11:39,851 --> 01:11:42,480
I've been saying well the amount of
damage they took in those fights was

1213
01:11:42,481 --> 01:11:46,860
catastrophic and you, you just, he
had a pace that no one can fuck with.

1214
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,150
You couldn't keep up with it.

1215
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:50,700
He just would keep it on you
over and over and over again,

1216
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:55,260
but his body just does not seem like
it can handle that kind of that kind of

1217
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,580
that a lot of fights though,

1218
01:11:56,581 --> 01:12:00,000
like even if it were to stop right now
to me still the greatest UFC heavyweight

1219
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:00,834
of all.
Yes,

1220
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,320
I agree but I feel like he could have
been the greatest greatest of all time.

1221
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,690
One is right up there with him,

1222
01:12:05,691 --> 01:12:09,510
his Fay door and you've got to give the
nod to fade or based on most recent for

1223
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:10,930
like his own canes,

1224
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:14,400
most recent fights you look at like
[inaudible] and you're like, man,

1225
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:15,234
you got to kind of,

1226
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:18,870
it's taught when you look at it on paper
like fade or during his hay day was

1227
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:22,750
something special for doom, beat fade or
though and that was like a legit fence.

1228
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:28,670
Not really the first guy
to do his own coaches.

1229
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:32,280
We're already talking about his lack of
preparation after the Brett Rogers fight.

1230
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:33,750
They said that he put a say in that,

1231
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:38,751
but we really didn't see no at Rogers
in his own coach was saying that he went

1232
01:12:39,451 --> 01:12:43,470
up and he uses old tricks but he didn't
prepare correctly. Is Brett Rogers?

1233
01:12:43,471 --> 01:12:47,830
Nolan did. Yeah, but Dallas
now fucking agent try.

1234
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:48,781
Fuck Dude.
Brett.

1235
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:52,200
Brett Rogers got arrested is trying to
fuck dude and he's homeless and then went

1236
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,550
to prison doing the same shit.

1237
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:58,680
So he got arrested after kind of touch
and two guys and then they sent him to

1238
01:12:58,981 --> 01:13:02,910
prison and then in jail he was
accused of touching his ma.

1239
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,980
She knocks him out and then fucks him.

1240
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:10,110
I don't know him being your
fucking cell man. God Damn it.

1241
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,450
Good time. He's the biggest
guy I've ever seen in my life.

1242
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,150
I remember interviewing him with,
and I'm not a tall man,

1243
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:19,610
but holding my hand straight up in the
air to interview him when famous show

1244
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:21,780
haymaker.
Right.

1245
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,810
Have you ever see the animated Gif
where his head goes flying off?

1246
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:29,040
It has his head goes flying off and it's
slams against the camera and creates

1247
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:33,290
this big bladder. Him The
internet is amazing. Fucking Huh?

1248
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:38,100
What'd you guys think of the Tito chail
fight? It was a legit fight for sure.

1249
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,250
Anybody is saying that it was a
work they looking at slow motion.

1250
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:43,710
They're saying that like Tito,
like motion thing.

1251
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:47,010
If you speed it up to like real time
and then the fight was going on,

1252
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:48,930
it's like this. He's trying to
hand fight. Yeah, he's trying to,

1253
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,540
he's trying to figure out what to do,
whether it could tuck his chin,

1254
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:53,040
whether he could move.
And by the way,

1255
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:57,180
you got to recognize that Tito has
had serious fucking neck surgery.

1256
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,930
He's got fused disks in his neck,
so he gets out of sketchy.

1257
01:14:00,931 --> 01:14:04,860
If someone's grabbing his neck,
understand why, but it just, you know,

1258
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:08,550
it was a bigger, stronger guy who
got ahold. There's the look of that.

1259
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:11,980
Oh,
the

1260
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,970
washes get it comes out.
Yeah.

1261
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:20,020
He's the craziest animated Gif file.
So sick.

1262
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:27,670
Right hand of all time.
The timing, man. Dude,

1263
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:30,190
the fucking Internet is amazing.
Actually.

1264
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:33,010
Look at the way you could probably
do that back and calf foot comes off.

1265
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:35,110
See the ways back foot.
It's actually a pitch.

1266
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,770
Mcgregor's left hand when it's done
right is the same thing. It's not,

1267
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:42,820
it's not a turning punchy
pivot and just wings.

1268
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:49,120
We rose countdown videos was like Kim in
the mountains like with fucking big logs

1269
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,840
and shit.
You remember when he,

1270
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:58,270
when he fought 'em what
the fuck's his name? Tim.

1271
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:02,740
Sylvia. When you'd fucked
up to him. Jesus Christ.

1272
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:06,510
Oh my God. It's Tim Silvia. Silvia
was Tim Sylvia. That was me.

1273
01:15:06,511 --> 01:15:09,280
Still fucking beat the wild wild west
where everyone's doing everything.

1274
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:14,350
Tim Silvia's basically seven foot with
a great jab and great deck gun offense.

1275
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:18,460
People forget about Tim Silvia. They
paid him six or $700,000 for that minute.

1276
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:21,880
Tim Silvia. Good. Yeah, it's
good pain. Clobber knackered.

1277
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:25,300
But I think that like if you
go back to the Tim Silvia,

1278
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:28,360
that Fault Rigo Rodriguez, Oh my
God, it's my favorite. Tim Silvia.

1279
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:33,320
Tim still jacked all the steroids
had

1280
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:38,140
giant killer CV.
Can find that Jamie,

1281
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:41,590
pull up Tim Silvia versus
Rico Rodriguez. And, uh, Tim,

1282
01:15:41,591 --> 01:15:44,080
if you listen to me right now and
you're mad at me now, I'm a fan.

1283
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:47,800
But you know you were on the shit so
shut the fuck up. I know. I love you.

1284
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:52,930
I think he had been at it.
We're not breaking any news here.

1285
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:57,040
It's funny. He was so scary
though when he was juiced up.

1286
01:15:57,070 --> 01:16:00,880
He was so scared guy when
he was watching stuff days.

1287
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:03,160
Those are the days of a different,
it was a different world.

1288
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:06,220
The juice to it when he fought Nogueira.
I don't think so.

1289
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:10,530
I think that we should watch that. I've
been testing the testing got significant.

1290
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:15,610
Yeah. Little Lucy, not me. Not like now.

1291
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:19,390
Now you take a fucking caffeine,
cast you back.

1292
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:24,190
Then after the fight they had a few
randoms. They did occasionally back then.

1293
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,150
Like dude's got like Ausra
got busted. Remember? Yeah.

1294
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:30,580
Officer got busted on a random
dude's got busted on randoms.

1295
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:33,070
Very recommissioned with the
commission would test you. Yeah.

1296
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:36,130
Well they started ramping it up right
around the time that they decided that

1297
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:40,240
this testosterone replacement therapy,
those arms, dude, he was so jacked.

1298
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,930
See if you can find the video. Jamie
was a fuck. Even his face, his muscular.

1299
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,390
Great. Back then. Holy Shit. Oh my
God. It was jack. He still was jack.

1300
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:53,530
He was heavy duty steroids because they
teased him about his body at the gym.

1301
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,060
Yeah.
He said he wanted a six pack.

1302
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,760
He kept saying he was going to have a
six pack. Kept telling me, I go, dude,

1303
01:16:57,761 --> 01:17:01,530
you don't need a six pack.
You're smashing. People
don't. Facts are for everyone.

1304
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,830
You didn't need it.
He was,

1305
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:05,380
but he was jack back down like
he didn't have a bad boss.

1306
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,160
He did everything to get the fans
that love. Remember he came out to,

1307
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,010
I forget what he

1308
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,850
come out. He came out to all of the G. No,

1309
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:16,400
he came out to g walks and
then you turn the Mike Mike.

1310
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:19,910
There'd be booing me like I'm doing it
for the troops like doing and it came out

1311
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:23,060
of the American flag. He
did. You check it off.

1312
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:26,720
People are going to love this and they
still just didn't wear the Jersey and

1313
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,920
everything, but we can't
beg for it. You can't bet.

1314
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,380
How did he look like a big bully I guess?

1315
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:38,370
Hmm. Tim Silvia is entrance to
Sylvia versus Vera Brandon Vera.

1316
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,920
That was back when Brandon vera was it

1317
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,820
Marion Brown and on the mic after knocking
out Frank Mir was like and be light

1318
01:17:44,821 --> 01:17:47,130
heavyweight champion heavyweight
champ pioneered that.

1319
01:17:47,131 --> 01:17:50,460
Conor McGregor and then they
signed a shit load. We got paid

1320
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:53,630
well it took a long time before he got
paid. They was out for a long time.

1321
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:56,420
But here's the other thing that happened.
He stopped training with rob came in.

1322
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,740
That was a big factor in his early success
is that he was training with one of

1323
01:18:00,741 --> 01:18:04,880
the greatest kickboxers of all time.
And Rob came in is so technical.

1324
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:07,370
I trained with rob for quite a bit
when I was supposed to do that.

1325
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:12,020
Wesley snipes things I did all my
striking with Rob Cayman and dude I was,

1326
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:17,380
I had an understanding of like how people
set things up and systems and systems

1327
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:18,521
that they struck under him.

1328
01:18:18,521 --> 01:18:22,670
But I had no idea that there was someone
out there that have that kind of depth

1329
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:26,660
to their thought process behind striking
cause all we would do four days a week

1330
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:30,470
was get together and talk strategy and
technique and striking and he would

1331
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:34,100
explain things to me and then we would
hit pads and then after we hit pads,

1332
01:18:34,101 --> 01:18:38,300
like two days a week I'd
spar with somebody mantle
and dude rob came in is a bad

1333
01:18:38,301 --> 01:18:39,081
motherfucker man.

1334
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:43,190
His techniques and his is
like his strategy and mean
that way he breaks things

1335
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:46,240
down. Mastermind. Oh he's,
he's genius man. And it's,

1336
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:50,180
it makes you really truly appreciate
like when you would watch his fights now

1337
01:18:50,181 --> 01:18:52,250
you'll see like all the
shit that he's setting up.

1338
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,200
We don't have to hold on on the
table anymore. It's legal now.

1339
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,000
That must've been awesome Joe.
Being able to do that with,

1340
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:01,480
with rob came in and tell
Joe who you want to do that.

1341
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:07,960
That's smart too. Yeah. I asked Matt, he's
a bad mother. He's a bad motherfucker.

1342
01:19:07,961 --> 01:19:09,730
He's,
I think he's the best coach in the game.

1343
01:19:09,731 --> 01:19:12,640
He has the best fighter in the game
and I think he's got the big picture.

1344
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:15,760
He puts the whole thing together.
He is the strength and conditioning coach.

1345
01:19:15,761 --> 01:19:16,890
He's the everything coach.

1346
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:21,380
And because of that he can periodize
everything properly. So you know,

1347
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,500
you're not sending your
guy over to another guy,

1348
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,810
unsure of when he's tired of what
he's doing on his schedule. He's,

1349
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:31,120
he schedules it all and Demetrius
actually trains a little bit less than

1350
01:19:31,121 --> 01:19:31,954
everybody else

1351
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:36,260
rests more. That's very smart. Well,
the thing about a guy like Matt humans,

1352
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,420
he's also got physical capabilities
that mirror worldclass fighters.

1353
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,520
Like he can fight like really fighting.

1354
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:43,890
You Watch his fight with Pat
Miletich way back in the day.

1355
01:19:43,891 --> 01:19:47,730
He fucked up pat military. She was like
one of the first super high level guys,

1356
01:19:47,731 --> 01:19:51,390
like super early on. Hey
Brian, you and the bathroom,

1357
01:19:51,391 --> 01:19:54,330
are you in the kitchen rather buddy?
Can you get me one of them?

1358
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,980
Cam butches one of them.
Um,

1359
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:59,090
well in Cam,
Gucci Calm Booch can Bluetooth.

1360
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:02,260
I'll go with
one of those jammy.

1361
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,070
Um, yeah, he's

1362
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,380
um, he's a wizard man and
he's seen it all. You know,

1363
01:20:10,381 --> 01:20:13,800
he was a judge back in
the glory days of pride.

1364
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:19,050
He never fought in the UFC,
but easily could. Thank you
sir. Easily, easily caught.

1365
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:21,480
Yeah. I caught some of his fights
ever and pancreas and stuff.

1366
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:25,620
I've broken him down from all fights and
it was one of them where he was riding

1367
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:28,980
this guy's hip and just spent
the whole fight back here.

1368
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:33,030
And at the time it was just so out of
character and I broke it down and then I,

1369
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,670
I saw him and he's like, yeah, thanks
for doing that. That was really nice.

1370
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:38,430
I'm like, cool. I said, how'd you do that?
And he just matter of factly. It's like,

1371
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:41,130
well, I knew he didn't understand this
particular kind of freestyle wrestling.

1372
01:20:41,131 --> 01:20:45,420
So I just designed the entire thing about
doing something he didn't understand,

1373
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,930
which was so natural to him.
Also,

1374
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:53,010
his dad trained with Bruce Lee
or, or um, uh, Dan Inosanto.

1375
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:55,500
So Bruce Lee to Dan
Inosanto to Matt's Dad.

1376
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:59,400
Like the lineage is still super legit,
so smart.

1377
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:03,410
So I asked him if I could come and just
stay in a cheap hotel nearby and come to

1378
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,260
shadow him for 10 or 12 days on my
own for my own costs for vacation.

1379
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:10,680
I said I cleaned the gym and whatever
I could do to help, and he said, yeah,

1380
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:13,440
I'm not opposed to it. Just circle back
to him. He's gonna make you clean the gym.

1381
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:17,610
I offer it. I shouldn't offer the
abroad. I'm going to start slow.

1382
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:20,570
Give me a couple of bucks. Oh, you don't
need to. I'll thanks man. Well done.

1383
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,433
Let me give you

1384
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:29,300
a hundred y'all go social media on you.
I'll put some Instagram posts.

1385
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:33,350
I'll do a breakdown every fucking
day of all the stuff. Videotape him.

1386
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,460
I want to do a piece on you.
Yeah.

1387
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:39,180
I told them I would document
it if he didn't mind, but
I didn't. Don't need that.

1388
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:42,600
I want you to new inspiration
said maybe February, maybe march,

1389
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:47,140
some mighty mouse is in camp.
Yep. How often do you train in?

1390
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,580
Three times a week if you're
doing them a matron, Jujitsu,

1391
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:54,150
powerlifting and strength and conditioning
and strength and conditioning.

1392
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,620
I'm always trying to customize it with
my coach Paul to Mimic what I'm seeing

1393
01:21:58,621 --> 01:21:59,700
guys too.
So you know,

1394
01:21:59,701 --> 01:22:03,600
everybody was moving so I had to start
to understand agility and direction

1395
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:05,310
change and stuff like that.
So customized,

1396
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:08,520
strengthen conditioning for things that
I'm trying to understand concepts and

1397
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:11,940
I'll do Jiu Jitsu once a week. I've
got a kickboxing coach, Evan Boris,

1398
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:15,150
who is one of Henry's guys, Henry
hoofs guys, he's up in Toronto,

1399
01:22:15,151 --> 01:22:18,280
he's really good and he's a good
friend so we can talk to go.

1400
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:20,970
He left in Florida,

1401
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:24,180
I don't know where he's going to
do and a lot of those athletes,

1402
01:22:24,181 --> 01:22:27,250
which just went with them right
away. He's the jam of that. He's,

1403
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:32,380
he's as good as it gets
man. And you know, so it's,

1404
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:35,820
it's weird political shit
when you put really smart,

1405
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:38,910
talented people all together.
If they don't have the exact same vision,

1406
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:41,310
some weird shit to chemistry thing,
you can't just throw it.

1407
01:22:41,311 --> 01:22:44,220
It's like the pro bowl. He can't
just hope all these guys get along.

1408
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:48,150
There's too many egos.
Winkeljohn is so unusual.

1409
01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:52,920
Those guys like Gel together so well k
eightK is a good example to Mike Brown is

1410
01:22:52,921 --> 01:22:57,210
so cool man. I kind of know one of
the most humble guys in the game.

1411
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:04,090
He's like more celebrate talk that if
you run a gym together like you gotta

1412
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:06,010
like, like Eddie, you
and I could run a gym

1413
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,110
together cause we know each other so well.
We're,

1414
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:11,740
we've been such good friends for so long.
We could run a gym together easy.

1415
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,530
You and I would have no problem.
We might disagree about some shit,

1416
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,660
but we disagree about shit all the time.
We never have a problem.

1417
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,240
You see one way I see another way.
But we would talk about things.

1418
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,570
We could actually run a gym and I would,
I don't think,

1419
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,030
I couldn't imagine we would have
a problem at all. I couldn't,

1420
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,300
I couldn't foresee anything that we
couldn't work out. Let's do an MMA show,

1421
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:33,280
the soccer field.
I'm fucking

1422
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:40,140
Hallock and that other guy
find on big soccer. Like

1423
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:44,950
I liked that fight, man. I don't give a
fuck what anybody says and props down.

1424
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,610
No problem. Perhaps to how it, Gracie,

1425
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:51,910
I love the fact that you didn't just
take a fight after a long time off.

1426
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,050
You took a fight to pay your debts.
You took a chance with Metamorris I,

1427
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:58,030
it's a big thing to take a chance.
All the criticisms aside,

1428
01:23:58,031 --> 01:24:00,310
which I'm sure he would agree,
many of them are valid.

1429
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:01,870
That fucking guy took a fight.

1430
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:05,680
You'll pay his debts and he took a chance
to start metamorris in the first place.

1431
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:09,700
It's not an easy thing to do, but to
give Jujitsu, professional Jujitsu,

1432
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:13,660
a platform and a high profile platform
and get guys like Eddie to fight guys

1433
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:17,080
like boiler, get all the guys and he
got to fight. He put on some very,

1434
01:24:17,081 --> 01:24:20,770
very good shows. Josh Barnett,
he had some really good level,

1435
01:24:20,771 --> 01:24:23,520
high level guys and I think
it elevated the profile,

1436
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:27,820
Jujitsu and then to go in there with that.
How do you say his name?

1437
01:24:27,821 --> 01:24:30,990
Sasaki cocktail. Cocteau.
It's [inaudible].

1438
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:35,950
That guy is a bad motherfucker. He
said dangerous, legitimate striker.

1439
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:39,240
He's knocked out Joe Schilling twice.
Not only just selling an item,

1440
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,530
he doesn't get hurt. He
doesn't get hurt. He goes,

1441
01:24:41,531 --> 01:24:44,890
three fucking room gets touchy as
amazing. Tim. He mounts in him.

1442
01:24:44,891 --> 01:24:47,770
He's dominating him in the
last minute of the last round.

1443
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,830
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
That's what I like about Jujitsu.

1444
01:24:50,831 --> 01:24:54,220
That's what I like about martial arts.
When I see a fight like that, I like it.

1445
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:57,150
That fight was fucking terrible for me.
I'm glad you guys,

1446
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:02,460
I think I don't have that on a football
field though. Yeah. Yeah. We've got,

1447
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:05,180
again, it would be, there
would be no fight. Where was,

1448
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,420
where'd the fight take place or where did
the fight go to the ground? Like wait,

1449
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,770
did they clot? No, but they collide
with the cage at all. I don't remember.

1450
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:13,030
I don't remember.

1451
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:17,000
I don't remember exactly when it was
against the kids only take that cage away.

1452
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,790
Action. It's a lot tougher for
Haluk window catch. Lots of,

1453
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,560
for everybody's tougher for
Cocteau to hit him to run. Yeah.

1454
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,810
You could move away and get zero action.
That's okay.

1455
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:32,970
That was always an never in
a cage to a combat sambo is.

1456
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,420
Oh. So it's proven that it actually does
work and there's no obstruction when

1457
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:41,300
there's not a wall or a cage way better.
There's no reason to go to the outside.

1458
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,020
But to this premium room,
it doesn't have to be a football feed,

1459
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:48,040
like a basketball court is plenty of
fucking room. I like what happened that,

1460
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:52,960
so the marsh, the combat will evolve
around the playing surface, the rules,

1461
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:56,590
the everything. And having that cage
made some beautiful martial arts though.

1462
01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:00,700
Like the, all the combat against the cage,
just beautiful. It is. But in a better,

1463
01:26:00,701 --> 01:26:04,100
when there's no other thing there,
there's no other factor is just

1464
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,850
two fighters with their bodies to
Splore. Yeah, you could eliminate,

1465
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:11,090
but it's a sport. When there's no cage,
you get a lawyer of they fight factor.

1466
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:12,470
But you can live in a fact.

1467
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:14,180
It's still not just to fight
cause there's no headbutts. No,

1468
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:18,540
I gouges know a lot of strikes, know,
shot feedback of the head. No talking,

1469
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:25,260
no cage. Unified rules
of MMA. I do. It would be

1470
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:30,540
this morning.
So Nikki,

1471
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:35,720
I liked the way it is. I love the way
it is. There's nothing wrong with it.

1472
01:26:35,721 --> 01:26:39,200
Who loves the way it is more than I do.
I love it. I do on the football field,

1473
01:26:39,201 --> 01:26:42,860
I wanted an a a basketball court.
See, we're making improvement.

1474
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:46,790
Went from football to basketball.
Sleep better on a basketball court.

1475
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,380
The audience would have,
they would have to look at the,

1476
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:53,030
at the screen the whole time. The
audience here, if you're on the floor,

1477
01:26:53,031 --> 01:26:55,640
you think you got the good seats on
the door. You got terrible seats.

1478
01:26:55,641 --> 01:26:59,360
If you're on the 200 people on the floor,
the good, the good seats are the risers

1479
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:05,270
on the floor. No Shit.
But here's the thing.

1480
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:09,110
In a basketball court, there's no floor.
So all that shit you see, that's floor.

1481
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:13,300
That would all be risers. Risers. Oh,

1482
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:16,850
do it would be perfect.
Perfect. It'd be great. Let's
do it. We can't get something.

1483
01:27:16,851 --> 01:27:18,960
I'll talk to start it up.
Set it up.

1484
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,570
Eddie and I are going to form an
organization going to make everyone aware.

1485
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:25,460
Rash guards to mandatory.
Love it. No, no, no.

1486
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:29,690
Greeson eliminates the greasing
tap planet. MMA. People
are greasing all the time.

1487
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,760
There's nobody checking. It's
illegal, but there are no test for it.

1488
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:35,360
Plus it's a big problem.
That dude's agree. Anytime.

1489
01:27:35,361 --> 01:27:38,870
Some guy who fights at black belt in
Jujitsu, of course he's going to Greece,

1490
01:27:38,871 --> 01:27:42,670
he's going to do it. No one
backing that. Just oil in the bath.

1491
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:46,190
But you guys know tag check.
There's no, no one's getting busted.

1492
01:27:46,191 --> 01:27:50,890
Like they're not swabbing
their backs. There's Vaseline
all over your face, right?

1493
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:52,180
You know, uh, uh,

1494
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:57,230
sports always change rules and
add things to increase the office.

1495
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:58,370
They never do.

1496
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:02,420
They never change shit to increase the
defense for the entertainment value is,

1497
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:04,820
and you need fail. Does
it? NBA does it. They are.

1498
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:09,000
They're trying to increase the
offense. Baseball, they do it.

1499
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:14,250
They're doing a shot clock and more
offense in fighting is more knockouts and

1500
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:19,640
more submissions. More the more
submissions of org awesome submissions.

1501
01:28:19,641 --> 01:28:20,474
People love them.

1502
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:24,350
The better for the sport when God guides
of greasing up and there's no tests and

1503
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:27,530
the easy way to fix that, have them wear
rash guards, have them aware of what,

1504
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:31,340
what, uh, Juliana Penny's wearing.
No big deal. It's not a problem

1505
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:38,610
where her rash guards all the time, you
get out their titties out exactly exact,

1506
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,850
but that the kids have arms.

1507
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:44,030
Could they or should they be able to
cover their arms and legs? Aoki. Tights,

1508
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:48,470
tights. That's an advantage though.
What an advantage is more offense, dude.

1509
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:50,630
That's what we're talking about.
Tweaking shit from where we go.

1510
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:56,770
Round one shift Chanko or precinct
four 50 44534502451 the more grease,

1511
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:03,720
the less submissions. It's a, this
is a really interesting fight here.

1512
01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:08,730
Chef Chanko is one of the best fucking
strikers in MMA, period. Any man, woman,

1513
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:09,360
whatever.

1514
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:13,530
She super solid and that check right hook
that she kept nailing Holly Holm with

1515
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,010
excellent, excellent footwork.
Superstrong Moy, Tai wants to,

1516
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:24,060
she's more decorated than Yolanda
and Holly. Johann kickbox.

1517
01:29:24,061 --> 01:29:26,230
Yeah, she beat you on a,
she's a lot bigger. So,

1518
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,560
and now she's about to have her way out
of here. She's going across the face now.

1519
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,860
She's way more bulked up now than then.

1520
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:34,290
I believe they were the same
weight when they, fuck. Wow.

1521
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:36,180
She's making good choices
here against the fence.

1522
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:39,640
[inaudible] agrees that she's got to
take her down, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1523
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:45,030
You gotta take shift Chanko
what if, what if she can't?

1524
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:48,630
She's got to get knocked down.
Knocked over. Next we're going to see,

1525
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:52,710
we're going to see, because this is her
whole strategy. Giuliana is tough as fuck.

1526
01:29:52,711 --> 01:29:55,920
She's very strong but she's
not a striker like in the,

1527
01:29:55,921 --> 01:29:59,790
in the realm of Chep Cenk skilled
discrepancies. Massive. Massive.

1528
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:04,740
She's going to be defensive to close
the distance and then this is what she's

1529
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:09,210
going to concentrate on the body
part. All part. That's awesome.

1530
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,650
She got taken out. I take downs and that
was a great choice to go black belt.

1531
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:15,120
She's going to let that happen.

1532
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:19,530
Why would she stop that judo black belt
could have been just a ploy to get the

1533
01:30:19,531 --> 01:30:21,990
fight to the ground. Cause cause a
lot of people are saying opinion.

1534
01:30:21,991 --> 01:30:23,460
The clinch is going to whoop her ass.
I'm like,

1535
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:26,650
she's a judo black belt are inside
trips and our hips are ridiculous.

1536
01:30:26,651 --> 01:30:30,090
So another reason to pull
guard. Yup. Yeah, for sure.

1537
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:32,840
She's also super physically strong.
She had pain.

1538
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:36,280
Who's doing all the right
stuff to chest fully like,

1539
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:39,360
but that's also the thing man pen.

1540
01:30:39,361 --> 01:30:43,020
His whole deal is on the ground being
on the ground and on the ground.

1541
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:43,950
She's super solid.

1542
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:48,840
But when you're dealing with a woman
who's a judo black belt and a nasty

1543
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:53,650
kickboxer boy you got a weird room to move
in. You got a tough fucking fire dude.

1544
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:57,420
It seems like the smart thing to
do is don't waste all your energy.

1545
01:30:57,421 --> 01:31:00,780
Just pull garden. That's a great idea.
But he's smart thing to do too though.

1546
01:31:00,781 --> 01:31:03,390
She's butt blasting or with
knees to the body. I mean bad.

1547
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:05,760
If she could pull it off,
you won't forget chef Genco.

1548
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:09,270
A lot of people think the Amanda
Nunez fight. It was only three rounds.

1549
01:31:09,271 --> 01:31:12,870
Who is five shift Chanko
probably wins that fight. Hey,
here's a pervert question.

1550
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:15,920
Has any girl ever gone down
from a shot to the Twat? Girl

1551
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:21,480
will they show the replay is what
you do to get kicked in the balls?

1552
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:26,550
They show it in slow motion.
Took it down again.

1553
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,890
She's got that great timing on
the trip that Judah look at us.

1554
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:35,670
Cause the legs, the feet aren't even
on the ground. Take down. Yeah. No,

1555
01:31:35,671 --> 01:31:38,640
she just gets tripped. She's throwing
knees and she's getting tripped

1556
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:41,710
and wants it on the ground and shift.

1557
01:31:41,711 --> 01:31:45,330
Chanko hasn't been regarded once or even
close to it. She's just crowding or,

1558
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:48,870
yeah,
she'll smarter shift Janka yeah.

1559
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:54,090
Juliana could recover a half guard and
if she's got half guard game or butterfly

1560
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:56,580
game or full guard came home
and just got to recover.

1561
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:02,820
She's trying to get to slide and get some
kind of guard Shannon across cause she

1562
01:32:03,221 --> 01:32:04,360
could just stand up and back out.

1563
01:32:04,361 --> 01:32:07,390
She's got to hold onto shift Chanko
so he's got to hold onto don't fucking

1564
01:32:07,391 --> 01:32:09,610
strong man.
She's like a coil,

1565
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:13,000
like a steel coil and now she's got,

1566
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:18,070
she's got her in three quarter garden now,
so she's good to strike the breasts.

1567
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:19,600
I mean it should be,

1568
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,800
you can't strike a woman's not wearing
genital protection at all. Right? Yeah.

1569
01:32:23,801 --> 01:32:25,680
They haven't got a cup.
No.

1570
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:30,130
What kind of chastity belt do that
and they brought a cop, right?

1571
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:33,810
I don't think so. But you're saying right
or do you know pretty sure they do. Jen,

1572
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,160
I don't know. Jamie, can
you please look that up?

1573
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:40,150
I wouldn't look like they're wearing a
cup will protect. That's what I'm saying.

1574
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:42,010
Like if you got hit with
the need of the clearest,

1575
01:32:42,011 --> 01:32:43,570
I'm sorry for calling a Twat earlier lady.

1576
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:45,890
So it's just doing it for comedic effect.
Um,

1577
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:50,410
but if if you do get hit in your
vagina with a knee strike or a kick,

1578
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:52,630
I've got to think that's
going to be very painful.

1579
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:57,670
We haven't done is like we're a girl
just buckled and level like some dudes do

1580
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:02,440
know like when Vandelay got kicked by
Gilbert Ivl stop the fight kicked him

1581
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:04,540
right in the nut. Got,
can you punch the titties?

1582
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:07,450
Like could you just start elbow
into the tit? I don't think you can.

1583
01:33:07,451 --> 01:33:11,710
I think the breasts are off limit. You
can. Has anyone done on those rules?

1584
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:13,750
Caldor that Joe,

1585
01:33:13,751 --> 01:33:18,751
I heard you say before that if a grind
shots were legal guys wouldn't be going

1586
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:23,590
down like this and I agree with you 100%.
You would become a climatized to it.

1587
01:33:23,591 --> 01:33:25,870
There's an entire martial arts
developed so that you don't take

1588
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:33,160
oh shot here.
Even if she pulls out,

1589
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:36,350
she has a chance. That's where
chances, it's just style.

1590
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:41,680
Dance. She could swim and take her to
spiderweb right here. Put that Shim.

1591
01:33:41,681 --> 01:33:45,060
She's never putting the shit the,
oh,

1592
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,520
he's got to get that deep hooker
left hook isn't deep enough.

1593
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:49,240
She's got to lose it.

1594
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:54,240
What the [inaudible] she got taken down
and Landon I can show and that was still

1595
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:01,930
good for all she had to do was recover
piece by piece, inch by inch. Look,

1596
01:34:01,931 --> 01:34:05,920
she ended almost an arm bar. That's where
she has, she needs to keep doing that.

1597
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:09,280
Get, she's not resisting the
takedown. She's letting her take him.

1598
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:13,410
Maybe she wants to find on the ground.
She's losing that.

1599
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:15,130
Ram had a chance.

1600
01:34:15,131 --> 01:34:17,510
She would have definitely lost if she
would have just stayed in standards.

1601
01:34:17,511 --> 01:34:21,910
Do it with her. But here's my
question. When men, uh, fight,

1602
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:25,570
they don't have them where any
specific type of cup, right.

1603
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,630
They don't tell them you have to
work in shorts checked at the front.

1604
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:32,700
You have to at least show your
way regular. Those are bullshit.

1605
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:36,100
Those are stupid. Okay.
It says, what does it say?

1606
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:40,420
Jail female and him wearing.
Wow.

1607
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,510
Wow.
I did not know that.

1608
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:50,230
Female mixed martial artists wear a
chest protector. That's some bullshit.

1609
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:53,490
Where a chest protector shall,

1610
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:57,950
thou shall wear a chest protector during
competition. Do they mean those, those

1611
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:03,010
sports bra chest protector shall be
subject to approval by the commission.

1612
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:06,080
So what kind of alerts or they can
have a hard one. Is that what it is?

1613
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:07,640
Like we're going to chest
protector these girls.

1614
01:35:07,641 --> 01:35:11,190
Why do you just mean you got to
cover, what state is this, Jamie?

1615
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:15,190
That's the UFC. UFC. Mm.

1616
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:18,440
So they're wearing so much to have some
padding on your nipples or something.

1617
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:22,820
Hold on. She's trying to hope for it to
go for that arm swing like a knee pad.

1618
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,760
But look how rugged chef co is.

1619
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:30,050
A brute dragger last attempt to that.

1620
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,030
Her core is so God damn strong.

1621
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:35,930
I mean she tried so hard to drag
her down to the ground like that,

1622
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:38,900
but her's cores so strong
or takedowns are so strong.

1623
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:41,450
It's one of the things I saw
her first UFC bound. I was like,

1624
01:35:41,451 --> 01:35:45,320
this girl is not just a kickboxer man.
She's so physically strong.

1625
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,030
When you were talking about movement,

1626
01:35:47,031 --> 01:35:49,670
whether you train with a movement coach
and you trained with a different kind of

1627
01:35:49,671 --> 01:35:51,050
strength and conditioning or something,

1628
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:55,310
when you can connect the upper and lower
through the core so powerfully and have

1629
01:35:55,311 --> 01:35:57,350
all the, you know, your nervous system,

1630
01:35:57,351 --> 01:36:00,700
be able to move everything together that
way it just makes you better guaranteed

1631
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:03,320
balance. Man. No one's got
balanced like judo players.

1632
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:06,860
They're so good at shift in their
hips and and adjusting their balance.

1633
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:10,580
Those guys are so hard to take down
the lifetime of that and girls rather

1634
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:12,590
obviously,
but you know what?

1635
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:16,910
You get that from breakdancers get
definitely gymnast even get that from like

1636
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:20,720
taekwondo people. Like a lot of people
that are used to doing things on one leg,

1637
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:22,820
like throwing kicks and stuff on one leg.

1638
01:36:22,821 --> 01:36:26,720
A lot of times those guys can adjust
really well and take down attempts and

1639
01:36:26,721 --> 01:36:31,340
movement. Look at Man, do you guys find
that taekwondo people play a better guard?

1640
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:35,840
They just have better sophistication with
their feet and the legs more. No Room.

1641
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:40,340
So no, no. The guard play start out with
the card players have a different kind of

1642
01:36:40,341 --> 01:36:43,640
flexibility first of all because the most
important flexibility isn't like full

1643
01:36:43,641 --> 01:36:46,850
splits. The most important
flexibility is growing flexibility.

1644
01:36:46,851 --> 01:36:50,930
It's like knee to chest, foot to face, the
ability to go double lotus to put your,

1645
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,640
your legs behind your head.

1646
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:56,570
That's so much more critical than
what's what you use in taekwondo.

1647
01:36:56,890 --> 01:37:01,490
So the dexterity is different.
I definitely think strong
legs plays a big factor.

1648
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:02,390
Like if you,

1649
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:06,380
if you're grappling with anybody who's
got strong legs for any reason and then

1650
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:09,870
they developed a dexterity and figure out
how to use them well extra slags. Yeah,

1651
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,040
I mean your legs carry your
whole body around all day, man.

1652
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:18,460
You know the difference between he's a
grinder and break dancers is the gymnast

1653
01:37:18,771 --> 01:37:22,330
or doing set routines and
breakdancers improvise.

1654
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:26,330
So judge and that's why it's better
for Jujitsu. I may size do come in,

1655
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:29,150
Jim has do come in and they got that,
you know,

1656
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,150
crazy monkey body strength.

1657
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:37,660
But Jujitsu is about making lightening
quick decisions and so quick that you

1658
01:37:39,171 --> 01:37:41,150
can't actually make them yourself.

1659
01:37:41,151 --> 01:37:44,390
You have to feel the body adapts body
as your body is going to make the

1660
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:48,470
decisions based on how it was trained.
That's it. If you're thinking about it,

1661
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:51,890
you're just,
but Juliana,

1662
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:56,160
she does not give her up. That was
beautiful, but she crushes are away

1663
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:00,060
from the octagon to she's fucking tough
as shit. Shit. She described herself,

1664
01:38:00,061 --> 01:38:04,230
she said on the hardest woman in the
MMA, the, you know when you said the MMA,

1665
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:09,780
I fucked it up. When you are one
round Gail piece, after this one,

1666
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:12,750
when you're out scale, then you're winning
with heart at. That's what we said.

1667
01:38:12,751 --> 01:38:14,190
Going into this one,
you got something.

1668
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:16,830
You're fighting somebody way more skilled
and experienced than you in a lot of

1669
01:38:16,831 --> 01:38:20,760
areas, but you have more heart and that's
impressive when you can make that work.

1670
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:24,140
That's all. I don't know it.

1671
01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:29,290
I'm telling you man should Chanko has
some nasty Jujitsu playing chess Giuliana

1672
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,250
chef submission. She
does. She does. She does.

1673
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,650
She played the whole risk of
going old school, pickles,
attention those guard man.

1674
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:42,930
She puts her head strong ass legs to
those kickboxing legs, those legs,

1675
01:38:42,931 --> 01:38:47,040
or they got some fucking horsepower
behind a man who's expanding the work.

1676
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:50,450
I mean here. Who's spending
both of them? Both of them are.

1677
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:54,840
Both of them are shift
Shankles. No joke man. No,

1678
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:59,100
but she's got a dish that ankle tattoo
too late.

1679
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:04,100
She's gone for seven 1980s nineties I
mean, I don't think she has the setups.

1680
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,950
Tap, tap painter based on what I see
right here. Her Garden, she hurts her.

1681
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:12,090
She has she, she gets posture. She lets
it go. She gets it. She lets it go.

1682
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:16,200
That tells me that posture is not
that important to her and that's not,

1683
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:20,510
there's no way you could
have a high level garden. Oh

1684
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:26,610
my God. Oh, that's good though.

1685
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:30,450
Oh,
I have to break your shit off

1686
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:35,400
to Eddie, but I was like,
this is going to be hilarious.

1687
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:40,220
What does that call when
that happens? Wow. Ironic.

1688
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:46,770
How do you say that?
You could ever be,

1689
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:49,270
but I just don't know.

1690
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:53,730
So far just it seemed like she
wasn't really attacking. That's,

1691
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,280
that's what I based it on.
But she just went for it.

1692
01:39:56,281 --> 01:39:58,800
She just swung her hips and
just fucking went for pain.

1693
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:03,400
You got a little cocky in there, you know?
And she, she beats, she beats in India.

1694
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,630
I think she wanted me to throw rounds.

1695
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:11,430
So what happened in the first fight
at noon as one at close to Susan Shift

1696
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:15,110
Chenko adapted and by round three
she was in better shape by round.

1697
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:20,730
She just snapped up here. Oh, you
know about Nunez, man. She's just,

1698
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,430
she's a nasty,
vicious striker,

1699
01:40:23,431 --> 01:40:27,390
but you are just not going to be able
to tee off like that on shift Genco.

1700
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:31,110
She's not going to be five rounds.
She's not going to be there.

1701
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,930
She's not going to be there. She's going
to be standing southpaw. First of all,

1702
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:37,010
she's going to be sliding off to the
right. She's always going to threat.

1703
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:42,450
Slash she's gotta throw nasty leg pants.
Chew your legs up.

1704
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:47,160
But you know, we know what one,
ah, I used to commentate for pride.

1705
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:50,550
Let's write 10 Hanzo fought Sakharova.
I'm commentating,

1706
01:40:50,551 --> 01:40:54,100
I'm the color guy and soccer.
Robert has a Kamora grip

1707
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:58,540
on Hanzo and out. And my commentary
was, well that's not gonna work.

1708
01:40:58,541 --> 01:41:02,100
I mean it may be worth [inaudible] is Jim,

1709
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:09,050
but
he gets it embraces art.

1710
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:13,420
It's a real story.

1711
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:17,620
It was worse than that because I was
actually commentating the show telling you

1712
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:21,630
you might be looking at the best women's
MMA fighter in the world, right? Yeah.

1713
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:25,590
[inaudible] Nunez has a mullet.
Yup. Her cause her head,

1714
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:30,880
her cause her hand celebrate that
tonight. It's her calls her, hey,

1715
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:33,910
any champion a mullet. But
when you think about it, okay,

1716
01:41:33,911 --> 01:41:38,911
you are one of the fucking world experts
in something and even you can be fooled

1717
01:41:40,031 --> 01:41:40,900
by watching that.

1718
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,400
So when people are saying they know
what's going to happen or could make it

1719
01:41:44,401 --> 01:41:48,700
picks, even the highest level of
expertise in the world can be deceived by,

1720
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,550
by what you see. If that's a compliment,
that's a compliment because it is.

1721
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,180
You were right up until that moment and
then you saw something that made you

1722
01:41:58,181 --> 01:42:00,010
give her a bit a different
perspective of it.

1723
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,740
This is what I've been trying to
tell people about all martial arts.

1724
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:06,070
Like when you were looking at fade or
whether we're looking at cane in the

1725
01:42:06,071 --> 01:42:09,010
moment, you can have an
idea of how good someone is.

1726
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:11,410
You couldn't have an idea of what's going
to happen if their fight somebody else,

1727
01:42:11,411 --> 01:42:15,010
but really you never know and really
you never know how good they're going to

1728
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:18,580
like how good it's going to look
until the whole thing's gone down.

1729
01:42:18,790 --> 01:42:22,990
Perfect examples, Ronda Rousey, like
if you look at Ronda Rousey, Rhonda,

1730
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:27,070
when she was dominating women was
dominating women that, let's be honest,

1731
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:31,540
at that stage of women's MMA, it
was flourishing. It was growing,

1732
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:35,380
but you had Gina Carano versus Cyborg
and that was the highest expression of

1733
01:42:35,381 --> 01:42:38,140
women's MMA before the UFC.
So you have strike force,

1734
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:40,960
strike force has some very good fights.
Rhonda shines,

1735
01:42:40,961 --> 01:42:45,961
Meesha shines and then boom during
the UFC and the women are sort of not,

1736
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:51,190
you know, you get Betcha.
[inaudible] you've got Alexis
Davis, you're not getting,

1737
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:52,660
you're not getting this.

1738
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:56,950
This is some next level shit
and this is what happens, man.

1739
01:42:56,951 --> 01:43:01,951
Just like MMA from 97 2017 has exploded
and become a totally different thing.

1740
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:04,120
This is the same way.
Same with the women,

1741
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:07,990
but that doesn't mean that Matt Matt
Hughes isn't one of the greatest fucking

1742
01:43:07,991 --> 01:43:10,870
welterweight of all time.
Even though Matt Hughes may be,

1743
01:43:10,871 --> 01:43:14,520
doesn't stack up with today.
You got a little time to time.

1744
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:19,530
He's an iPhone one and he's got
an iPhone and that one was sick.

1745
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:23,070
Exactly.
The fucking suck.

1746
01:43:23,071 --> 01:43:28,071
And the mass phone call Zack change and
people change and they change moment to

1747
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:32,200
moment to, and the truth,
the word truth. You know,

1748
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:36,070
we describe things with opinions and
using limited language and all of these

1749
01:43:36,071 --> 01:43:38,580
things, but the truth is
the moment, the truth,

1750
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,350
you know of all the
cliches in fucking sports,

1751
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:44,570
the moment of truth is
the fucking best one too.

1752
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:48,310
You go into a fight and they say,
go, that is the moment of truth.

1753
01:43:48,311 --> 01:43:52,310
It's fucking truth. Rise. Do cyborg

1754
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:54,680
versus Rhonda.
No can,

1755
01:43:54,681 --> 01:43:57,980
I don't know Ron tracks over do that.
First of all,

1756
01:43:57,981 --> 01:44:01,040
I think contractually she could fight
outside the UFC and I don't think she

1757
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:04,680
would fight outside the
UFC and I definitely don't
think she'd fight unhealthy

1758
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:08,320
that he's trying to see people's shit.
She retired.

1759
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:12,290
You want to see people does the contract
once you retire, right? No, I've retired.

1760
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:15,440
I'm retired in soon as I went, I want to
fight someone else. Do you have c goes,

1761
01:44:15,441 --> 01:44:20,370
cool. Here's your contract.
They freeze it. Yep. Oh yeah,
like Walt Disney. The, yes,

1762
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:24,200
that's true. Yup. Yeah.

1763
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:27,420
It's not that simple and I don't think
she would do that anyway. No, nothing.

1764
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:30,920
I'm most likely terrible idea. Why
not? Cause I think first of all,

1765
01:44:30,921 --> 01:44:35,921
Cyborg is probably walking around
north of one 99 I'm not exaggerating.

1766
01:44:37,011 --> 01:44:39,950
She was doing dead lifts with three.
She's mad at me by the way.

1767
01:44:40,010 --> 01:44:44,340
Who blocked me on Twitter? Cyborg.
Cyborg. If you listen, I'm not,

1768
01:44:44,341 --> 01:44:47,330
I'm not a hater. I'm not a hater, but
I have to call him like I see him,

1769
01:44:47,331 --> 01:44:48,051
good or bad.

1770
01:44:48,051 --> 01:44:51,860
I tweeted a long time ago that I'd like
to see the UFC open on one hour and 45

1771
01:44:51,861 --> 01:44:55,670
pound division. So cyborg could fight the
people that are her way. Welcome Cyborg.

1772
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:59,090
But I was saying that a long time ago
because this is even before all the

1773
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:02,330
controversy where me and Tony got in
trouble for joking around about her.

1774
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:05,210
But this was, I was saying like,
it's crazy to try and make this grow.

1775
01:45:05,211 --> 01:45:07,520
Go to 35 she's not 35 pound fighter.

1776
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:10,670
She's just struggle to get the 45 letter
fight at 45 and let's see what's up.

1777
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,330
But build it. They will come, they will.
There will be continuing to take awhile.

1778
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:15,980
But that fucking moment she would,

1779
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:20,680
I stand right here in the middle some
she got upset because they're saying no,

1780
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:25,070
you guys going to fight you and I'm going
to win. And then she, I met off that.

1781
01:45:25,071 --> 01:45:28,090
Yeah. And one laugh that the other one,
she looks like a bad guy from commando,

1782
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:32,710
but it was doing girl crazy.

1783
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:36,860
That's Russian dance, Russian
twerking. There are hard people.

1784
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:41,120
She's rough. She's rough.
It's a super athlete.

1785
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:44,570
But let's hear what she said.
Yeah, we can back it up.

1786
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:50,510
Can we give us some volume so we get
to hear that shit sac. That's bad ass.

1787
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:53,840
Awesome. But anyway, about the Cyborg
thing, I got to tell the truth,

1788
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:57,530
which I hear your job. Oh, I got
to tell the truth on both sides.

1789
01:45:57,531 --> 01:46:00,800
And she failed to use a test.
Not One but two,

1790
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:04,520
you know one of them was from a different
drug and this one is for some diuretic.

1791
01:46:04,521 --> 01:46:09,260
That's also used as a DHT inhibitor. This
is not like this is public news. Yeah,

1792
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:12,740
that's not gossip. It'd be is fair. It's
document. It is what it is. You know,

1793
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:12,980
I don't,

1794
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:15,350
she shouldn't have taken something that
was bad and they would never been an

1795
01:46:15,351 --> 01:46:19,700
issue. But let's go. Let's hear this
first. I pay money to have her attack.

1796
01:46:19,701 --> 01:46:20,750
Tony and Brian,

1797
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:25,723
here we go.

1798
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:31,920
Juliana is a resident.
Hello.

1799
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:35,430
How are you willing to
deal? Is this, I love it.

1800
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:43,980
She is excellent. Ooh. You show up that
discipline. You take your training camps.

1801
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:47,840
Were you surprised at how successful
you were taking her down? Around one.

1802
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:52,950
I was working very hard.
I was only on this fine.

1803
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:54,140
Thank you to Michael.

1804
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:55,610
She,
she waits for the knee.

1805
01:46:59,190 --> 01:47:00,023
Yeah.

1806
01:47:06,850 --> 01:47:10,500
Oh Shit. And she is not the
slightest. Oh yeah, I'll get that.

1807
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:12,010
Nice friendly smile.

1808
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:15,693
A,

1809
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:38,620
it is so hilarious.
Broken English

1810
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:47,910
roast battle.
It's a roast battle with broken English.

1811
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:51,610
Eddie Bravo was like,
play that back.

1812
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,930
She can dance. Oh Dude.
She's an athlete, man.

1813
01:47:59,931 --> 01:48:02,720
She's so goddamn pouch.
She talked to him was so bad.

1814
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:07,370
That's going to be a great fight. All of
us moving ahead. We're moving forward.

1815
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:12,830
We're moving forward. We're moving
forward. These are animal fighters.

1816
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:16,580
That's even better.
That's even better when it happened.

1817
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:18,890
You're going to get to get that
tape and you're going to chop it up.

1818
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:19,850
But what she said

1819
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:24,980
so important because what she said there
is that you're seeing to real world

1820
01:48:25,711 --> 01:48:30,150
champion caliber mixed martial artists.
They do everything Nunez.

1821
01:48:30,151 --> 01:48:33,780
A black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu,
choked out. Miesha Tate choked out.

1822
01:48:33,781 --> 01:48:37,530
Sarah McMahon. When she's a beast.
Dude, she's nasty or fucking power.

1823
01:48:37,531 --> 01:48:41,790
Punching saw Longreach she gets after it.
This is super dangerous.

1824
01:48:41,791 --> 01:48:44,670
I would fuck that cheeseburger up right
now. By the way. It looks good. Right?

1825
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:49,650
Right. If only, if only it
was healthy. Mm, nice wine,

1826
01:48:49,651 --> 01:48:52,110
Brian. We don't pry around.
Brian knows his shit.

1827
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,570
He knows her shit when it comes to wine.

1828
01:48:53,571 --> 01:48:56,090
He'll talk to Somalia about
grape locations, Darren,

1829
01:48:56,091 --> 01:48:58,800
right by where they grow
them on the hill vocations.

1830
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:02,400
I will know whether that is a difference
between a burgundy and a Pino.

1831
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:04,560
And actually it's kind of the same.

1832
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:08,190
We were talking about
cannabis.

1833
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:10,060
How about how

1834
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:12,870
people talk about wine 50 years ago.

1835
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:15,420
Way Different than they talk
about it and understand why now.

1836
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,580
And that's the same thing
with fighting and what we see.

1837
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:22,500
Those women are so much better than
women's fighting was one year ago.

1838
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:28,310
Parents a one. What's interesting
subtleties and it's just,

1839
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,890
it took a while for them to get into
the UFC and then it took a while to find

1840
01:49:31,891 --> 01:49:32,724
their place.

1841
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:36,330
And then like when you see like someone
like you wanna like when you want to

1842
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:37,530
what was super,

1843
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:41,370
super evident when you wanna Fuck Carlos
bars that and when she fought Julianna

1844
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:44,790
Pena when she fought, uh, not uh,
uh, Jessica went, you've got Jessica,

1845
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:47,170
Jessica Peninnah. No, I always mess it up.

1846
01:49:47,171 --> 01:49:51,060
You fucked it up when she flat Jessica
Pinay it was a murking, you know,

1847
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:51,970
it was nasty.

1848
01:49:51,971 --> 01:49:55,760
She was smashing her and slicing her up
with elbow is called nip tuck those job.

1849
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:59,230
It was rough. It was rough. And
when you see that you're like,

1850
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:01,090
okay well this didn't exist before.

1851
01:50:01,091 --> 01:50:03,310
When you watch those kind of
lightening fast combinations,

1852
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:06,960
that front front kick to the face
she hits goes girls with I Pang,

1853
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:11,830
she's digs the hips in that Nasty Long
Jab that she has just super high level

1854
01:50:11,831 --> 01:50:15,320
striking. And I think when you,
when you see that and you, you,

1855
01:50:15,321 --> 01:50:16,690
you opened the door to that,

1856
01:50:16,691 --> 01:50:18,750
it's like we were talking
about before about your ear,

1857
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:20,320
you build it and they will come.

1858
01:50:20,321 --> 01:50:23,590
All these other women are going to step
in to that and they'll fill that void

1859
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:26,480
was done. Rise up to
that level. He had the,

1860
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:29,320
the base level rises like the bay,

1861
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:32,230
Jamie chilled out TV
average level goes up.

1862
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:34,230
Do you know that might still watch all,

1863
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:37,090
you know the fight was the lowest
level to fight, but that's some news.

1864
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:41,980
I thought it was TV. No, no, you can
still the Nogueira if want to watch that.

1865
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:46,570
Hell yeah. Get that on a, is it on
fight pass? I think it's on fight pass.

1866
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:50,100
See if you can find enough.
Fipass Kimbo don't

1867
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:55,270
like represented, but anytime
too. I was going to say athletes,

1868
01:50:55,271 --> 01:50:59,860
I don't know if maybe you can put me
on this one. Came up was Ken shamrock.

1869
01:50:59,861 --> 01:51:00,940
That was a great fight.
Yeah.

1870
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:05,020
New One 50 I mean when people
watch it and got great listening,

1871
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:09,490
I couldn't wait for it to start. Did you
enjoy the fights? Couldn't wait for it.

1872
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:13,080
Why don't you got to be
young to fight? Oh, what am I

1873
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:21,070
senior to have? Like obstacles,
like fucking garbage cans and shit.

1874
01:51:21,490 --> 01:51:25,750
Things, laying around to GRANDPA's
football field. No rules.

1875
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:32,950
We leave pizza boxes laying all around
the field, so do slip on them and shit.

1876
01:51:33,070 --> 01:51:36,700
And they fight on grass wet grass
like right after the sprinklers,

1877
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:39,760
the sprinklers kick on and the crowd
roars cause that means it's all about the

1878
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:44,090
[inaudible].

1879
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:47,280
And then you have dudes come out and
they throw the pizza boxes down and they

1880
01:51:47,281 --> 01:51:48,970
have guys coming to
place the garbage cans.

1881
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:54,310
Garbage cans are filled with like fucking
used cat food cans and Shit fucked up

1882
01:51:54,311 --> 01:51:57,700
diapers. Like yeah, cause
you got to plow into them.

1883
01:51:57,701 --> 01:52:01,720
It's gotta be like old dudes fighting
championships, super hot cheer.

1884
01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:03,580
But all those, before they
get started, they get drunk,

1885
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:06,700
they do the sit there and they drink.
They seniors,

1886
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:10,060
everybody like you have to have at least
four drinks before the fight starts.

1887
01:52:10,061 --> 01:52:12,430
They pour 'em out,
they stare at each other at the bar,

1888
01:52:12,431 --> 01:52:16,210
they do these shots and then the
doctor goes, okay, we're good. 75.

1889
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:20,950
And they push them out there. We can
just do downtown La if you want. No,

1890
01:52:20,951 --> 01:52:23,290
that's crap. But it's not helping the, uh,

1891
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:26,920
the thing about any of those changes you
just made, they all change everything.

1892
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:30,040
Like change any one thing
and everything changes.

1893
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:33,850
If we suddenly allow like kicks to the
head of a down opponent four points,

1894
01:52:33,851 --> 01:52:37,360
it's a whole different game.
Every position you change.

1895
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:40,930
I think we were talking about it. I think
there should be no rules of any kind.

1896
01:52:41,330 --> 01:52:46,000
And, and I, and I got you
biting everything and,

1897
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,680
and I don't mean you're
going to have this. Yep.

1898
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:56,840
This is a parallel universe in which we
could do this. Where it isn't a sport.

1899
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:59,510
Nobody will watch this. Let me, let me
get you, let me get to you right here.

1900
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:02,540
What if regenerative medicine,
regenerative,

1901
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:07,610
regenerative medicine reaches a point
where they can literally shoot stem cells

1902
01:53:07,611 --> 01:53:10,970
right into your eyeballs, grow you a
new eyeball, 100% guarantee. It's like,

1903
01:53:10,971 --> 01:53:13,760
it's no different than
you getting one stitch.

1904
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:18,350
You get a cut that needs one stitch.
It's nothing,

1905
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:19,860
but they're just going to shoot you.

1906
01:53:19,870 --> 01:53:22,760
You know that they do that now with
third degree burns due to have horrible

1907
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:23,600
burns all over their arms.

1908
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:28,040
They spray him with stem cells in your
skin grows back in like a matter of a few

1909
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:32,720
days. People who were scarred for life
now have no visible scars whatsoever.

1910
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:37,100
No, no, no, no, no, no. It has
to be fresh. It has to be fresh.

1911
01:53:37,101 --> 01:53:38,690
But while you have all that damage,

1912
01:53:38,691 --> 01:53:43,340
all of your body does spray stem cells
all over your body and your body just

1913
01:53:43,341 --> 01:53:48,280
grows tissue. It looks amazing.
Fucking amazing. Spray it.

1914
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:53,150
No. Well, maybe. Maybe that might
work. Oh, it's amazing. I mean,

1915
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:54,380
that's probably the future.

1916
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:57,800
But once they reach that point
where a guy biting your nose off,

1917
01:53:57,801 --> 01:54:02,240
does it really mean you lost your notes?
Right? Then you take pictures. Hey,

1918
01:54:02,241 --> 01:54:05,820
I'm at the gym with a fucking look up
by nose cavity. It'd be doctor says,

1919
01:54:05,821 --> 01:54:09,210
no three days. Go ahead and
fire for three seconds. Yeah,

1920
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:14,000
so weird check. Look up
there. Look up there.

1921
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:17,720
Look at this. See, before
after fucking massive,

1922
01:54:17,721 --> 01:54:21,280
was that a black person before light?
After you turn white, but you're,

1923
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:22,420
you're healthy.
No,

1924
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:27,650
it's sprays a victim's own stem cells
onto the wounds and it regenerates tissue

1925
01:54:27,651 --> 01:54:32,450
at a fucking ridiculously fast rate. It
didn't say that. No, no, it does, man.

1926
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:36,650
Look, you could go into it, uh, online
and see the studies that they've shown,

1927
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:38,570
but it's fucking amazing.

1928
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,770
Severe Burns and they're able
to do this procedure. Yeah.

1929
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:47,570
90 minutes and within weeks there
are 100% healed. That's a ceremony.

1930
01:54:47,610 --> 01:54:50,900
Results within days. Look at that.
Stem cells regenerate the skin,

1931
01:54:50,901 --> 01:54:55,700
leaving no scars. So now do we know
this is legitimate? No, this is 100%.

1932
01:54:56,170 --> 01:55:00,050
100% sounds like a scam.
It's to NASA. Anytime.

1933
01:55:00,051 --> 01:55:01,340
Youtube and it's in the library.

1934
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:07,630
The library. I just said
that. Both. Both. Yeah.

1935
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:10,610
It's both Dewey decimal system.
He looked it up.

1936
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:13,040
It's double pro with the last time
you went to the library. Brendan,

1937
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:17,600
what does the library, he'd been
reading the librarian in Vancouver.

1938
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:19,520
This way to not teach.

1939
01:55:19,521 --> 01:55:23,990
Canadians had to read recently
we did some research on you.

1940
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:28,380
We know your background was you
were working for the other side.

1941
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:31,820
So now we imagine it's okay, we can
bite. We can tear out whatever. Okay.

1942
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:35,520
If that's the case and you can rebuild
tissue a hundred percent why not? So,

1943
01:55:35,650 --> 01:55:39,200
and the reason it would be fascinating
is because over time he'd never get,

1944
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:43,750
well actually if we can rebuild it, uh
Oh my God. Every magician change the,

1945
01:55:43,751 --> 01:55:46,010
I suppose the face biting 20 years,

1946
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:50,910
brainstorm a in the brain to your brain.

1947
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:53,010
They're working on that.

1948
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:56,570
They're working on regenerating traumatic
brain injuries would if it gets to the

1949
01:55:56,580 --> 01:56:00,360
drain kickboxing class, you know, you
can't ever spar because of brain damage.

1950
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:03,390
But every night you could
go in and knock out 10 dude,

1951
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:07,050
you get knocked out three times. That's
cool. It's not as cool anymore. Is it?

1952
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:10,960
Because the risk is, that will always
be cool. Everyone was sitting trades.

1953
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:12,780
It's like the fucking killing brain cells.

1954
01:56:12,781 --> 01:56:14,520
It's about shutting a
dude off and dominated.

1955
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:17,910
It's about killing brain cells gives off
this shouting I'm off and dominate IOM.

1956
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:21,190
No Eddie's right. If there's no
consequences physically. Yeah, yeah.

1957
01:56:21,191 --> 01:56:24,810
I mean then it's a totally
different thing. No one's cowboy.

1958
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,630
That's not true. You're,
you're not, you're not,

1959
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:29,880
it's not true because that's Jujitsu.
Cause you do too.

1960
01:56:29,881 --> 01:56:32,180
You're killing each other without
killing each other. What'd you did too?

1961
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:35,130
You get a guy's back and you fucking
put that choke on him. He taps.

1962
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:38,730
He's basically saying, you killed me. If
we're in the wild, we were in the jungle,

1963
01:56:38,731 --> 01:56:41,580
you would've killed me. So you let them
go. You slap hands. You start again.

1964
01:56:41,581 --> 01:56:42,330
It's better.

1965
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:47,330
Like Jujitsu people I think have a better
bond than at least the gyms that I've

1966
01:56:47,551 --> 01:56:49,350
been around that a lot
of people that boxing,

1967
01:56:49,351 --> 01:56:52,880
spar and kickboxing sport because
they hurt each other. Yeah.

1968
01:56:52,910 --> 01:56:54,900
You have a weird relationship
with each other. Like guys,

1969
01:56:54,901 --> 01:56:57,920
I used to spar kickboxing
with those weird relationship,

1970
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:02,520
which I know I was trying
to hurt these guys. Me,

1971
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:06,030
they're breaking my nose and Shit I think
has mentally too because it does hurt.

1972
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:09,750
It doesn't hurt. You know what I'm
saying? Like when you're doing it enough,

1973
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:14,170
you get app out. One of you. One though.
It hurts the ego, but physically, yeah,

1974
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:16,990
but it was like a chap from the
heavyweight light. Turns off, man,

1975
01:57:17,790 --> 01:57:20,570
every time you get wrecked, how many
times you've been hitting the bag.

1976
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:24,400
You think about some time that some dude
fucked you up in sparring, just rocked.

1977
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:28,500
You Inspire. You get mad
when you're hitting the bag
like you, you want revenge.

1978
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:29,640
It's totally different.
Yeah,

1979
01:57:29,641 --> 01:57:32,760
the scores that got settled even
subconsciously when they spa,

1980
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:37,320
oh he wants more one or the Indians out.
We don't get Tequila out for us. Got It.

1981
01:57:37,321 --> 01:57:41,070
That's actually a very valuable knife
that was given to me by Justin Wren.

1982
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:44,130
How was he? Got It from some people in
the Congo because we built wells for them.

1983
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:47,330
I was actually going to slap him
if he poured me another drink. Oh,

1984
01:57:47,331 --> 01:57:48,200
that's what that was about.

1985
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:54,260
Don't drink or I'll stab you with is
the opposite. This move discipline. Hey,

1986
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:57,210
you know for black belts,
we've been through this already.

1987
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:03,570
Speaking up being a few virtual
reality, you went to fight.

1988
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:05,770
It doesn't really work.
If you're a virtual reality,

1989
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:09,810
somebody cause you don't get hurt. What
if they use taser technology in with it.

1990
01:58:09,990 --> 01:58:12,750
So as you got hit, you got
taste. You know what man,

1991
01:58:12,751 --> 01:58:16,020
you virtual reality doesn't work
because it doesn't hurt. But God damn,

1992
01:58:16,021 --> 01:58:19,410
it's good for drilling. I've only done
it with boxing. I only did it once.

1993
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:22,950
It's kind of weird because like,
you know like if you look at gloves,

1994
01:58:22,951 --> 01:58:25,170
like if you're, you're looking
at your gloves in front of you.

1995
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:28,020
Like if you think of,
you have your hands like this,

1996
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:31,800
that's how the gloves will look. But
it's not, the gloves are like this.

1997
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:33,450
So you hold your hands like this.

1998
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:36,990
So you're in front of the guy and you
find yourself throwing punches like this

1999
01:58:37,290 --> 01:58:40,650
because you want your, your wants your
fist to look like an actual pipes.

2000
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:44,200
It's a little odd like that. Like they got
to Polish that up. But other than that,

2001
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:47,980
when the guy hits you, you see a
flash of light. That's not enough.

2002
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:51,670
It's not enough. But it's
interesting. But it's interesting,

2003
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,880
like a little bit of a Zap.
Yeah.

2004
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:58,090
But it's far as like just
developing your skills.

2005
01:58:58,180 --> 01:59:01,870
It's feedback and really that's all
you need is feedback and then you would

2006
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:04,990
figure out a way to get so good at
the game and get your head movements.

2007
01:59:04,991 --> 01:59:05,830
So on point,

2008
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:09,410
it's this virtual guy could never hit
you and your skills would be super sharp.

2009
01:59:09,830 --> 01:59:14,500
Then you could move into another stage
of it so that you wouldn't have like

2010
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:17,410
there's one of the things that's a big
problem with teaching people at a strike

2011
01:59:17,411 --> 01:59:20,620
is the panic of getting hit.
Like you can look great on pads,

2012
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:23,380
but then when you're actually sparring
there's a panic of getting hit.

2013
01:59:23,381 --> 01:59:25,240
So how do you get a
person passed that panic?

2014
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:28,840
Well you got to get them to spa light and
you've got to get them to trust people

2015
01:59:28,841 --> 01:59:32,680
and develop their skills so that as
the punch comes, you're not locking up.

2016
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:34,960
Cause some fucking Francis and Ghana dude,

2017
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:37,630
his throne nuclear missiles at your dome.
No,

2018
01:59:37,631 --> 01:59:40,000
someone's just touching you and
you get to learn to do it that way.

2019
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:42,670
You can do that virtually and
you can't do with everything.

2020
01:59:42,671 --> 01:59:45,640
It's not going to work with
Jujitsu because it's too
much moving and scrambling.

2021
01:59:45,641 --> 01:59:50,140
And chunking down and you feel them.
But what you don't,

2022
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:54,610
what you don't have is uh,
you, you like, you don't,

2023
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:58,330
it's going to be difficult to like throw
kicks, like kicks are going to be weird.

2024
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:01,060
Like maybe you could do that.
We'd have to have something on your legs.

2025
02:00:01,070 --> 02:00:05,560
Soldiers or military does where they try
to mimic it through computers and then

2026
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:05,760
he,

2027
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:09,070
they tried to the exact t and put them
in stressful situations and then when the

2028
02:00:09,071 --> 02:00:12,310
bullets are real really firing a
lot of them, it's when it's real,

2029
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:15,910
there's nothing that can do.
It helps for sure.

2030
02:00:15,911 --> 02:00:19,000
It didn't hurt to play one of those games
in Afghanistan where they gave us like

2031
02:00:19,001 --> 02:00:23,320
rifles and you had noise and video.
They mimic so stressful.

2032
02:00:23,321 --> 02:00:25,120
You get so pumped,
but it's still a video game.

2033
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:27,100
It's just not the navy seals delta.

2034
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,980
He's like even we do all that and
then even when the real blows Flan,

2035
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:33,160
I'll look right in behind me and the
guys just frozen because it's real.

2036
02:00:33,161 --> 02:00:35,240
He knows the consequences problem.

2037
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:38,590
The big problem with the virtual reality
boxing thing is you're actually not

2038
02:00:38,591 --> 02:00:43,390
hitting anything like you need to
practice. So my ideas is crazy.

2039
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:44,770
No wait,
it's okay.

2040
02:00:44,771 --> 02:00:49,330
I'm telling you that a man like a
robot on some kind of thing that gets

2041
02:00:49,331 --> 02:00:51,670
controlled like this and he moved,
there's a row,

2042
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:54,670
you're actually boxing of robot chicken.
You've got balloons,

2043
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:58,980
he's got actual balloons for fifth with
powder on it. Somebody else's contract,

2044
02:00:58,990 --> 02:01:01,600
get a bunch of blue powder all over.
You know what I mean?

2045
02:01:01,601 --> 02:01:06,190
So you're boxing got balloons for hands.
So you gotta like hit Shit. And you know,

2046
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:07,053
they did

2047
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:13,400
it was actually doing it like a real
will be the wolverine played on the actor

2048
02:01:13,970 --> 02:01:16,780
Wolverine. They did that
movie off. What are these?

2049
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:21,810
Oh these are these for football kind of
shit and chase after you knock a robot

2050
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:25,090
and they stole your idea. That's
a good idea. But what I'm saying,

2051
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:29,920
yeah, but you know that thing
that I got in my garage, Eddie,

2052
02:01:29,921 --> 02:01:31,600
that rubber guy with the,
you know,

2053
02:01:31,601 --> 02:01:34,140
it's just a torso and you
could combination box on them,

2054
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:39,640
have something like that with arms throw.
Yeah,

2055
02:01:39,650 --> 02:01:43,060
you give him a bone on the upper arm,
you know, you give him some rigid,

2056
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:46,040
rigid rigidity, but then the
lower arms for the forums down,

2057
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:50,120
you just have it as just a rough
issue you could do with the robot.

2058
02:01:50,150 --> 02:01:50,870
Just the words it,

2059
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:55,870
it's just a robot and you just got to
program it to go down and you can teach

2060
02:01:55,881 --> 02:01:59,680
them this James
to shoulder roll.

2061
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:04,880
If you can avoid the robot. It's
not like a real fight, but damn,

2062
02:02:04,881 --> 02:02:05,930
it's pretty damn close.

2063
02:02:05,931 --> 02:02:10,931
You're avoiding these combos that are
prone programmed in by nerds down the

2064
02:02:12,370 --> 02:02:16,880
wing. Chung dummy with some rudimentary
concept related to that. No,

2065
02:02:16,881 --> 02:02:20,120
because it didn't move, but this
lesson to start with now movement,

2066
02:02:20,121 --> 02:02:21,650
you start with an object and then late,

2067
02:02:21,651 --> 02:02:24,240
everybody moved telling you
this virtual reality thing is,

2068
02:02:24,241 --> 02:02:28,110
is really there's somebody,
it doesn't matter because it's you're,

2069
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:31,460
you're moving and you're shadow boxing.
There's a lot of shadow boxing.

2070
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:32,510
You're not hitting your thing,

2071
02:02:32,511 --> 02:02:34,670
but you're visualizing this
time you're visualizing,

2072
02:02:34,671 --> 02:02:36,840
but something's in front of you.
And when you hit it,

2073
02:02:36,841 --> 02:02:41,330
it's head snaps back and you can move
away from shots and dig to the bottom line

2074
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:43,470
is better. But I liked that one.
That one. Could you get your,

2075
02:02:43,471 --> 02:02:44,304
you're buying the idea.

2076
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:47,330
The two of them are might together
and that's going to happen.

2077
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,390
Get Elon Musk on it.
Like mix

2078
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:55,750
mass on it. I have celebrities.
Ilan calling about a fight.

2079
02:02:56,230 --> 02:02:59,160
We call him Brian. I'll let you know. I
must give you one. I'll give up. Yeah,

2080
02:02:59,190 --> 02:03:01,460
call him back. He bought a Tesla.
You get a, you get a phone call.

2081
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:06,340
One phone with the car.
Yeah, I'm a celebrity. I'm
fucking on TV. I saw that, uh,

2082
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:08,480
Mickey Garcia fight that you
were telling me about it. Mike,

2083
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:12,480
your Mickey Mikey Garcia.
He was telling me for an hour 36 and oh,

2084
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:15,120
it was a horrible knockout. How
bad. I thought that guy died it,

2085
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:17,300
but it took two minutes to get them up.
And Garcia.

2086
02:03:17,301 --> 02:03:20,630
He took like a couple of years off
because of um, promotional problems.

2087
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:26,170
They got problems in MMA and boxing that
are real similar that way where they

2088
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:28,610
tied up with promoters
and shift goes down.

2089
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:33,680
But there's so many promoters in boxing.
You got the Goossens, you got Bob Arum,

2090
02:03:33,681 --> 02:03:36,010
you got, you know, fucking
Floyd Mayweather productions,

2091
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:41,020
the money team to get out of Globe
and has his own Canelo has his own,

2092
02:03:41,670 --> 02:03:42,790
I'll have some promotions.

2093
02:03:42,810 --> 02:03:45,410
They're starting to like branch out
because he's worked with golden boy.

2094
02:03:45,411 --> 02:03:48,080
But he does have his own
promotion to the UFC.

2095
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:52,490
If I was at UFC and I just spent $4
billion to buy the UFC and all this shit

2096
02:03:52,491 --> 02:03:54,440
starts going down, I'd be
like, you mother fuckers,

2097
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:58,520
do you know how long it's gonna take to
make back that $4 billion with you guys

2098
02:03:58,521 --> 02:04:02,500
all holding a big ranch and off
and start your own promotions. But,

2099
02:04:02,530 --> 02:04:07,410
but that's why. That's why your salad
now sell again. No. Why they salt?

2100
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,210
Yeah, those guys. Fuck yeah,

2101
02:04:11,211 --> 02:04:16,211
they know what look the Renzo is
his genius and long right time.

2102
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,360
These guys are cause before
when Lorenza was there,

2103
02:04:20,450 --> 02:04:23,750
people felt like they know the
motherfucking fucking Godfather.

2104
02:04:23,751 --> 02:04:27,800
He was right there. He was the guy.
He's whatever decision the Renzo wanted.

2105
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:31,430
I mean you've got frank right there too,
but whatever decision the Renzo wanted,

2106
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:35,650
it was just done. No questions. Boom.

2107
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:39,870
So everyone felt loyal to that,
you know,

2108
02:04:39,871 --> 02:04:41,970
and like you don't want to fucking leave.
You know what I mean?

2109
02:04:41,971 --> 02:04:45,360
This is the Godfather. You know what I
mean? Now it's like who owns the UFC?

2110
02:04:45,361 --> 02:04:49,980
We didn't know one. You don't know those
guys. Yeah, but here's the thing, man.

2111
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:56,270
It's far as the UFC got for in two to up
to 2017 nobody anticipated up til 2005

2112
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:59,880
even in 2005 nobody saw that coming.

2113
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,290
But then the first episode of the
first ever ultimate fire EHRs,

2114
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:07,950
and then it becomes a huge superstar
event with Stephan Bonner versus Forrest

2115
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:10,800
Griffin and the files, millions of
people tune in, the world explodes.

2116
02:05:10,801 --> 02:05:15,480
MMA becomes popular. And then here
we are, 12 years later looking at it,

2117
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:19,350
nobody saw this. If they can keep
going like that. See that's the thing.

2118
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:23,160
Painted exponential growth.
You don't anticipate it.

2119
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:27,660
These guys like scurry and super bore.
These guys like Yahya, Rodriguez,

2120
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:31,510
volunteers, all these Frances and
got all these new superstructure,

2121
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:33,840
Conor Mcgregor,
these new superstars emerging,

2122
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:36,360
this shit could be twice
as big five years from now.

2123
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:39,540
It's like your positive attitude.
Positive about this.

2124
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:41,810
I'm saying I love it.

2125
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:46,770
No one's more bullish on MMA than me.

2126
02:05:46,771 --> 02:05:50,320
I think it should be the biggest sport
in the world. Yeah. I think it's the mom,

2127
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:53,640
the one that transcends boundaries.
It transcends cultures and races.

2128
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:58,650
It makes sense. If a guy
dunks a basketball in your
face, at the end of the day,

2129
02:05:58,651 --> 02:06:01,950
the only saving grace is a pitch. I
will find you outside. No, fuck you up.

2130
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:04,740
But if you fuck somebody, I got
some guy up and he goes, oh,

2131
02:06:04,741 --> 02:06:07,260
I can still dunk a basketball on you.
Nobody gives a shit.

2132
02:06:07,590 --> 02:06:11,790
It's the end all be all of
sports is the super aggro. Yes.

2133
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:15,540
It's almost not even as a girl.
Yes. Not even super aggro.

2134
02:06:15,630 --> 02:06:17,160
It's more impressive than anything.

2135
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:23,130
If someone wins some crazy us open
tennis tournament and that's an amazing

2136
02:06:23,131 --> 02:06:23,490
thing.

2137
02:06:23,490 --> 02:06:27,530
If Conor McGregor knocks Floyd Mayweather
the fuck out with a piston like left

2138
02:06:28,270 --> 02:06:29,103
hand,

2139
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:36,610
it might not happen, but if it
did, the world explodes too.

2140
02:06:36,611 --> 02:06:41,611
But anyone can [inaudible]
you can join us.

2141
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:49,570
Not In the NBA, not in the NFL. You can.
It's married but it can fight in the UFC.

2142
02:06:49,571 --> 02:06:54,350
Cm punk pumpkin. It's the Ross
Forum. Brenton shops cheese.

2143
02:06:54,570 --> 02:06:59,030
He gets Moody's morning.
So Nigga,

2144
02:06:59,050 --> 02:07:01,980
you don't have much more
impressive in his I'll Lebron James

2145
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:07,410
Caan team. Absolutely. Come on. Does
that more impressive? Oh my God.

2146
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:12,500
Destroying another man.
That's the most impressive shit come food.

2147
02:07:13,210 --> 02:07:15,400
Pure Mba

2148
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:21,000
[inaudible] up another dude,
man.

2149
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:24,080
I'm telling.

2150
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:27,870
I'm saying that what you did is the most
the of shit and what you did not being

2151
02:07:27,871 --> 02:07:30,290
in a team and be like,
whoa. Not athletically. It's

2152
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:36,060
the ball in the hole. He's a
moose. Makes me do it again. What

2153
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:40,690
makes that bat? The ball goes in
the hole being you're being a,

2154
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:42,340
what's the word and insider.

2155
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:47,470
Cerios Joe's hit the ball with the racket

2156
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:54,300
at a hundred miles an hour ago.
We just got,

2157
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,940
we just got done looking at this field
full of baseball players early going,

2158
02:07:57,980 --> 02:07:59,710
he'll pull watches that
stupid fucking game.

2159
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:05,620
And I enjoy watching baseball. Hitting a
home run. It's the hardest thing to do.

2160
02:08:05,621 --> 02:08:07,330
And professionals,
you're a contrarian.

2161
02:08:07,331 --> 02:08:10,170
It's not even close to the hardest thing
to do. The hard knock knockout, Josie,

2162
02:08:10,171 --> 02:08:13,660
all the with one punch, 13 seconds and
after you talk shit about him for a year,

2163
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:20,200
the odds are higher hitting a baseball.
Shut the fuck up Jimmy Burke.

2164
02:08:20,590 --> 02:08:24,670
Imagine baseball fight companions.
Imagine how bad that would pick that.

2165
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:26,793
Hey,

2166
02:08:27,210 --> 02:08:31,510
I can pay to watch the Dodgers
with the reds be awesome.

2167
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:34,990
Baseball fight companion. We have amazing
cause we'd be drunk and high as fuck.

2168
02:08:34,991 --> 02:08:39,430
And I'm like just be
like a ceremonial thing.

2169
02:08:39,431 --> 02:08:42,010
We don't actually watch the game.
We just put it on.

2170
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:46,300
I can guarantee you there
are baseball companions.

2171
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:51,430
What do we need to do?
It's a NASCAR fight companion

2172
02:08:56,740 --> 02:09:01,540
or WWE. Nascar. Bet some serious money.

2173
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:03,310
I'm telling you guys,
these all exist.

2174
02:09:03,311 --> 02:09:07,490
They called him second screen experiences
in every sport now is doing them every

2175
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:09,810
day
after Joe

2176
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:15,790
fell has a second screen experience.
They started doing this in the last year.

2177
02:09:16,030 --> 02:09:19,480
All of them, the NFL has to sec, they
call it a second screen experience.

2178
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:21,240
Mother fucker.
Hold on.

2179
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:24,400
What's the whole website called like
ramble on or something like to anybody can

2180
02:09:24,401 --> 02:09:28,770
get on and make their own companion
for India. They should call John Rules.

2181
02:09:28,830 --> 02:09:32,250
That's like chat rooms or
don't. I mean, uh, who else?

2182
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:36,310
Who else was do you never saw someone do
it. You invented it. Here's what I did.

2183
02:09:36,311 --> 02:09:38,980
Here's what I did.
I'm the first guy for sure.

2184
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:44,020
That is the lead commentator
for a gigantic organization,

2185
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:48,460
like a professional sports organization
that also does a thing on the internet

2186
02:09:48,461 --> 02:09:50,940
where they smoke weed and talk
shit watching the same way.

2187
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:56,410
[inaudible]

2188
02:10:02,430 --> 02:10:03,370
you're the only ones.

2189
02:10:05,550 --> 02:10:09,280
If they can cuss,
wouldn't that be cool?

2190
02:10:09,281 --> 02:10:13,750
Joe could just because people have said
that for years and now you're actually

2191
02:10:13,751 --> 02:10:16,660
doing, but here's the crazy
thing. He's faking companions. Get

2192
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:22,280
more downloads than any
broadcast and views. Yes.

2193
02:10:23,330 --> 02:10:28,330
They get as much downloads is a major
Fox card on a major Fox UFC world

2194
02:10:28,871 --> 02:10:31,140
championship card.
That's how many downloads he seeks care

2195
02:10:34,950 --> 02:10:38,630
we're, we're closing in this month on,
we're probably, what are we at right now,

2196
02:10:38,631 --> 02:10:42,380
Jamie?
I checked before.

2197
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:45,800
We're going to get close to 85 million
for the month. That's for Youtube? No,

2198
02:10:45,801 --> 02:10:50,600
that's for iTunes. Just
iTunes and then youtube is how
much point? 2 million. Yeah.

2199
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:52,880
Can you ask yourself why
they're watched so much?

2200
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:57,730
Not just keeps [inaudible]
at a million views.

2201
02:10:57,830 --> 02:11:02,830
A way more way more than what you got
super drunk with Cameron Hanes tower

2202
02:11:04,131 --> 02:11:08,000
seven. That's when it's like
5 million. What's it at?

2203
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:11,950
600,000 no.

2204
02:11:11,970 --> 02:11:15,710
Well what is it on the audio
is the last firing cap.

2205
02:11:15,711 --> 02:11:20,410
We did almost 6 million downloads
a serious Eddie. Your recap, Eddie.

2206
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:22,990
That's after the fight. The
recap, the 6 million downloads.

2207
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:26,220
He's got one word on iTunes.
It's talking about youtube though.

2208
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:30,260
When the youtube is not as much. Youtube
is only like, well, what percentage?

2209
02:11:30,290 --> 02:11:35,150
How many views per episode? Percent.
20% of the nobody. How many views?

2210
02:11:35,151 --> 02:11:39,590
Like what is merely average
visa lately for that? That's it.

2211
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:42,680
Like 5 million for audio about
weighing up to 1 million for you.

2212
02:11:42,681 --> 02:11:44,440
Two videos like it depends on the show.

2213
02:11:44,450 --> 02:11:47,160
1 million when you and I are on
with Alex Jones, which will buy,

2214
02:11:47,190 --> 02:11:49,320
but by the way be episode nine 11 dude,

2215
02:11:49,460 --> 02:11:52,500
I'm working so hard and make an episode
nine 11 I'm doing so many goddamn

2216
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:56,510
episodes just like just so I can get
to number nine 11 with Alex Jones.

2217
02:11:58,130 --> 02:12:01,340
That's Wednesday, right
Wednesday. Alex Jones,

2218
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:06,560
how huge cascade and be home shit.

2219
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,470
And it's going to be episode nine 11 and
that's what I'm going to keep my mouth

2220
02:12:09,471 --> 02:12:11,900
shut. I'm going to keep going
to ask you a fun. First of all,

2221
02:12:11,901 --> 02:12:15,190
we're not doing it sober, so don't even
try. It's going to get weird. Come on,

2222
02:12:15,191 --> 02:12:17,570
let him,
he's not going to be sober either.

2223
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:20,000
I just want to maybe ask a
question or two but I'm going to,

2224
02:12:20,030 --> 02:12:21,140
we're going to house shut.

2225
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:25,370
We're going have not gonna say anything
like the Flintstones Jones. I love him.

2226
02:12:25,450 --> 02:12:30,200
Love. Does he smell queen? Uh,
neither can confirm nor deny.

2227
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:33,860
Even if you don't,
if you're in this room,

2228
02:12:33,861 --> 02:12:36,080
you're smoking weed or
whether you like it or not,

2229
02:12:36,081 --> 02:12:38,180
you're taking a contact
high of epic proportion.

2230
02:12:38,181 --> 02:12:42,360
I walked in and smelled it right away.
Alex Jones is going to,

2231
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:47,160
that Shell might break records. It's
going to be interesting. Come on.

2232
02:12:47,170 --> 02:12:49,020
Cause would be bigger than lands.
Armstrong.

2233
02:12:49,021 --> 02:12:50,330
Any what's your big bigger than Atlanta.

2234
02:12:50,350 --> 02:12:52,790
So I'm showing what's one of
your questions you wanna ask him.

2235
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:55,070
Don't say don't give it away
cause it prepare for it.

2236
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:59,510
You gotta sneak it up on them. The weird
thing about conspiracy horse that make,

2237
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:03,010
that are making a living off
conspiracy theories is, is uh,

2238
02:13:03,110 --> 02:13:07,910
there are so many conspiracy theories
and a lot of guys are just like into one

2239
02:13:07,911 --> 02:13:12,080
or two and they're experts or ninth or
experts on JFK and they fucking know

2240
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:16,490
everything about this. It's so deep
and so sophisticated and complicated.

2241
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:17,900
The whole JFK thing,

2242
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:21,560
all the theories and all what could have
happened and all that. It's so deep,

2243
02:13:21,710 --> 02:13:26,430
dude, spend their whole life on that.
So when they talk to dudes are, are,

2244
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:29,270
are, are still believing in CNN
and they're trying to convert them,

2245
02:13:29,271 --> 02:13:32,540
try to wake them up a little bit.
What ends up happening is there,

2246
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:37,620
they've invested so much money
in JFK that they can't, uh,

2247
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:39,810
they're not even looking at other ways.

2248
02:13:39,811 --> 02:13:42,570
We're getting fucked because then
they deny all that other shit.

2249
02:13:42,690 --> 02:13:46,290
So when other people bring like
other crazy conspiracy theories up,

2250
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:50,130
they got to say, that dude's a shill.
He's tall. He's right about the JFK shit.

2251
02:13:50,131 --> 02:13:52,740
Cause I know cause I studied that, but
all this other shit he's talking about,

2252
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:55,170
that's got to be a shield.
So it's good to know you,

2253
02:13:55,200 --> 02:14:00,200
Eddie Lee Harvey Oswald Killed Jfk.

2254
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:06,630
Everybody,
let me finish what I'm saying real quick.

2255
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:08,250
Everybody thinks not everybody,

2256
02:14:08,251 --> 02:14:11,040
there's a lot of conspiracy theories
out there that are experts in certain

2257
02:14:11,041 --> 02:14:15,990
conspiracies that they think Alex
Jones is a shill because he's not,

2258
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:19,110
what is that? A vacuum? Some crazy.

2259
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:25,860
Anyways, the ground, let me send
this, this road's creamy finishes.

2260
02:14:26,070 --> 02:14:29,670
So there's guys out there, ouch. I'm
going to be on the Goddamn show Wednesday.

2261
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:31,020
And there's a lot of conspiracy.

2262
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:35,160
There's that think he's a shill because
they're not talking about the conspiracy

2263
02:14:35,161 --> 02:14:39,280
theory that they spent all their
time on. Like Alex Jones is like, I,

2264
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:42,490
you know what, there's, there's
different levels of transparency

2265
02:14:44,350 --> 02:14:48,660
as a generalist and a specialist
in everything and a generalist,

2266
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:51,630
the specialists can go deeper
in their one specialty.

2267
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:56,840
Then any generalist conspiracy theorists
argue with each other more than with

2268
02:14:57,811 --> 02:15:01,890
skeptics. It's incredible. Like the
scene, everybody's pointing things.

2269
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:02,970
He's a shill.
He's the show.

2270
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:07,860
Just cause they're not spending time or
promoting your, like Alex Jones, he's,

2271
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:11,310
he's into certain conspiracy theories
and it's, uh, it's like, you know,

2272
02:15:11,311 --> 02:15:15,270
he's got his plan,
his agenda to wake people up or whatever,

2273
02:15:15,271 --> 02:15:18,140
whatever he thinks he's got his
plan. And then this guy's had, has,

2274
02:15:18,210 --> 02:15:19,800
this is how we do it. This guy walk, come,

2275
02:15:19,801 --> 02:15:22,470
you're not talking about what they're
doing and how come you're not talking

2276
02:15:22,471 --> 02:15:23,304
about the Jews.

2277
02:15:27,090 --> 02:15:31,770
Conspiracy theories are accusing each
other of being scheels all the time

2278
02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:35,880
because they're not like Alex
Jones has his own agenda.

2279
02:15:36,210 --> 02:15:40,590
I don't know. That happens in every little
sub culture though. Like in fighting,

2280
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:42,450
uh, you know, certain people,

2281
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:44,280
he's going to try to change
the subject here to fighting.

2282
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:49,080
And I'm not going to let you know it
was going to say that's exactly why you

2283
02:15:49,081 --> 02:15:52,260
start to get news sources
that are credible.

2284
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:57,140
So what happens is don't
talk about credible sources.

2285
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:04,720
The economist, how many years can you
look up? How many years old? The economy,

2286
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:08,600
it's over a hundred years old. And
so the kind of narrow, well hold on,

2287
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:11,370
why does eight, why does it
magazine stay there? Well,

2288
02:16:11,371 --> 02:16:16,020
because what happens is if they start
posting news, people will read it and say,

2289
02:16:16,021 --> 02:16:18,330
that must be true.
When it starts not being true,

2290
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:23,250
people will stop reading that newspaper
or that magazine. This was bullshit.

2291
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,550
So that's why certain news organizations
develop a reputation team 43 God,

2292
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:30,070
hold on. It's been, there you go.

2293
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:34,290
So what happens is you can't fool
people that long. Okay, Carol,

2294
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:38,250
while Eddie after a while and
he called us. No, no, no Eddie,

2295
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:41,860
you've got to let them. Teddy. The
economist is a very credible source.

2296
02:16:42,130 --> 02:16:46,570
And if it wasn't, they would get
found out not only by people like you,

2297
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:50,730
but also by other news. Okay,
hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold the other news outlets.

2298
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:52,990
Heady. You let them talk and then I
got a question for you about this.

2299
02:16:52,991 --> 02:16:54,010
So there are,

2300
02:16:54,070 --> 02:16:58,210
there are credible sources
of news which you adhere to.

2301
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:00,700
I know you do.
And the question becomes,

2302
02:17:00,701 --> 02:17:05,701
what is the criteria by which
you can trust a news source?

2303
02:17:05,951 --> 02:17:09,670
A company that promotes news,
that reports news.

2304
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:12,340
There has to be a vetting process.

2305
02:17:12,610 --> 02:17:16,920
And what I'm saying is that you develop
a reputation after a while because it's

2306
02:17:16,930 --> 02:17:20,820
pretty easy to find out if you've been
lying for a 140 years about every news

2307
02:17:20,821 --> 02:17:21,820
story.
Yeah.

2308
02:17:22,210 --> 02:17:25,300
So what happens is you start that you
have to get your news from somewhere,

2309
02:17:25,301 --> 02:17:27,280
right?
You have to rely on it somewhere.

2310
02:17:27,550 --> 02:17:30,610
So what they do is they get people
who are investigative journalists.

2311
02:17:31,150 --> 02:17:34,000
When you have, what if you had a news
organization where you'd say is you'd say,

2312
02:17:34,030 --> 02:17:35,500
I want three,
four,

2313
02:17:35,501 --> 02:17:39,670
maybe six different credible
sources before I print this.

2314
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:44,090
I would imagine you'd be that way. Right?
Right. Uh, uh, people who actually, yeah,

2315
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:49,100
so people who corroborate the same
story and they have independent lines of

2316
02:17:49,121 --> 02:17:53,800
either inquiry or investigation, whatever
it might be. And that's kind of how,

2317
02:17:53,801 --> 02:17:57,460
and that's why I invest in reading,

2318
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:59,920
not just the New York Times,
but the economist,

2319
02:17:59,921 --> 02:18:02,200
two sides of the political spectrum,
NPR.

2320
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:05,950
And when I hear three publications like
that, that a one that's independent,

2321
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:10,200
one that, that gets, it relies on
like a public sourcing, not, not, uh,

2322
02:18:10,450 --> 02:18:13,990
not private sourcing. After awhile
they're all reporting the same news story.

2323
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:15,340
There's gotta be some truth to it.

2324
02:18:15,910 --> 02:18:19,990
The CIA has infiltrated
all mainstream media.

2325
02:18:20,050 --> 02:18:22,470
You are being pumped.
Okay. But hold on a second.

2326
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:30,130
Here's a question. I'm not
saying stop. Stop. What do
you know about the economist?

2327
02:18:31,090 --> 02:18:36,050
Um, I know that if it's
mainstream media, it's, it's,

2328
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:37,840
if there anything for me,

2329
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:41,590
the mainstream media is controlled
by the government. Okay.

2330
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:44,200
But you understand that
anything that the mains,

2331
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:47,710
all the mainstream media all agrees
on and anything that they're pushing,

2332
02:18:48,130 --> 02:18:53,130
I am automatically seriously skeptical
about it because our government has lied

2333
02:18:53,531 --> 02:18:57,430
to us for Millennia.
Changed thing may say,

2334
02:18:57,460 --> 02:18:59,530
I understand you're saying
it. I'm not trusting. I know,

2335
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:00,460
I understand what you're saying,

2336
02:19:00,490 --> 02:19:05,170
but you really don't have any information
to go on based on the, uh, when you,

2337
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:08,170
when you talk about this
particular magazine,

2338
02:19:09,650 --> 02:19:12,790
you don't know anything about,
I'm not an expert in the economist,

2339
02:19:12,791 --> 02:19:16,520
but I'm pretty sure,
I guess I'm going,

2340
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:19,300
I'm pretty sure its own buy I understand.

2341
02:19:19,990 --> 02:19:22,370
You have to understand is
happening is happening.

2342
02:19:23,990 --> 02:19:28,250
Having a prejudice, dismissive attitude
without having actually examined

2343
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:31,130
it is part of the whole problem we have
with information. The first place. Right.

2344
02:19:31,190 --> 02:19:32,210
You might be right,

2345
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:34,520
but you haven't examined it and
you're already throwing it away.

2346
02:19:34,521 --> 02:19:37,430
But before ever looking into it at all,
it's a giant,

2347
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:42,140
it's a giant issue because there's people
that are worth billions and billions

2348
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:44,270
of dollars. They're getting their
financial information from somewhere.

2349
02:19:44,271 --> 02:19:45,170
Where's it coming from?

2350
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:48,320
Are they sharing it with each other
and then eating babies and fucking each

2351
02:19:48,321 --> 02:19:49,400
other?
Like what are they doing?

2352
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:54,590
Or are they getting it
from a longstanding,

2353
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:59,680
credible source that all these
different super rich people rely upon?

2354
02:19:59,751 --> 02:20:02,690
And that's why it's
critical. No, but Eddie,

2355
02:20:02,691 --> 02:20:04,820
you don't know if it's untrue,

2356
02:20:04,821 --> 02:20:07,760
but you're prejudging it and
that's not healthy either.

2357
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:11,030
That's one of the reasons why a lot of
these conspiracy theories fall apart is

2358
02:20:11,031 --> 02:20:14,470
because there hasn't been any forethought
into concoctions. Let me speak,

2359
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:19,010
just immediately step in and say, if
it's mainstream, it's gotta be this,

2360
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:21,470
this is this. When you have a, uh,

2361
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:24,770
let's just say a criminal
who's been in jail,

2362
02:20:24,771 --> 02:20:29,060
who's been in jail for
uh, uh, credit card fraud.

2363
02:20:29,061 --> 02:20:33,410
He's just a shit bag. Does one
person, yeah, just one dude. One Dude.

2364
02:20:33,411 --> 02:20:36,860
Just a shit bag. Criminal
credit card, fraud, robbery.

2365
02:20:38,290 --> 02:20:41,020
Go ahead. Are you going to
believe these guys bad? This guy,

2366
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:46,310
but he's not a person that's not the
government they began with the economist,

2367
02:20:46,311 --> 02:20:48,140
you know,
is not really connected to the government.

2368
02:20:50,030 --> 02:20:54,770
I'm not an expert in the
economist. I understand, but
that assumption is negative.

2369
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:58,770
It's not smart to assume that you might
be smart. You have to trust criminals,

2370
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:01,880
trust.
But you're not talking about criminals.

2371
02:21:01,881 --> 02:21:06,881
You're talking about a long standing
magazine that's dedicated to explain the

2372
02:21:07,251 --> 02:21:11,960
economy and very pragmatic terms.
Mainstream media is criminal,

2373
02:21:12,330 --> 02:21:15,170
but he made that decision.
But there's nothing that could be

2374
02:21:17,050 --> 02:21:21,680
criminal when you don't eat something
that the state has a long history of

2375
02:21:21,681 --> 02:21:25,370
credit fraud and robbery.
Is there anything that can tell you that

2376
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:31,340
comparison, this piece, and the economist
gets everything wrong. Look at this,

2377
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:36,810
but this is one of the reasons why is he
criticized? But this is a [inaudible].

2378
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:38,610
Put that in context please.
Can I put that in?

2379
02:21:39,090 --> 02:21:43,520
So Steve Forbes is a Republican and
very, very right way. So what he,

2380
02:21:43,521 --> 02:21:48,521
what he's all he's doing is he
is budding Obama's point of view,

2381
02:21:48,650 --> 02:21:49,360
right?
And now let's,

2382
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:53,330
let's point out that Obama is not an
economist and Obama probably got an

2383
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:57,920
honorary position as a journalist to
post this thing. That's how it works.

2384
02:21:57,921 --> 02:22:00,980
So the economist is not about, it's
not economists that right. It is it.

2385
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,660
The economist says, hey, write a piece.

2386
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:07,400
And what they'll have is they'll have an
op ed piece. They, they, they, so you can,

2387
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:09,890
yeah. So when you can write
something, if your Obama,

2388
02:22:10,100 --> 02:22:14,330
the economists will allow you to be
sort of the, a featured, uh, opinion,

2389
02:22:14,630 --> 02:22:17,700
what's the date on those? That's why they
call it her. Not that this was November.

2390
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:20,840
So it's an opinion editorial, right?
Is that right? Yeah, it's an bad,

2391
02:22:21,080 --> 02:22:21,770
so when you eat it,

2392
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:24,980
it's criticized by people who
disagree with the New York Times.

2393
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:26,130
The back of the newspaper

2394
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:30,390
every, every, every day is an op Ed page,
which is different. Various journalists,

2395
02:22:30,391 --> 02:22:34,650
some right wing most left wing who give
their point of view on the world and not

2396
02:22:34,651 --> 02:22:36,180
so much like,
uh,

2397
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:40,170
cause a lot of like Nicholas Christoff
was in there working with women in Kenyan

2398
02:22:40,171 --> 02:22:44,880
schools and stuff or, or the, or slate.
Uh, I'm sorry, a forced prostitution.

2399
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,370
This is an investigative journalist
not making any money by the way,

2400
02:22:47,550 --> 02:22:48,390
but he's in there.

2401
02:22:48,391 --> 02:22:52,380
And what he'll do is write an op Ed piece
that will bring your awareness to the

2402
02:22:52,381 --> 02:22:56,340
fact that for example in Cambodia there's
a lot of sex for sale and it's really

2403
02:22:56,341 --> 02:23:01,290
horrible et, et Cetera. So you know
it's worth giving the New York Times.

2404
02:23:01,350 --> 02:23:05,400
It's worth giving. The economist
is worth getting MPR a fair shake.

2405
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:08,250
You might learn something cause
to say that it's all lies.

2406
02:23:08,251 --> 02:23:12,620
Eddie is a little extreme and also
they wouldn't be in business if,

2407
02:23:12,770 --> 02:23:16,200
because people don't like to be fooled
and I don't think you can fool people all

2408
02:23:16,201 --> 02:23:19,540
the time. Good. Full. Okay.

2409
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:22,630
That's the way I see it.

2410
02:23:24,010 --> 02:23:29,010
I mean I you've been had by the CIA
operation mockingbird you've been had but

2411
02:23:29,641 --> 02:23:34,230
wait a minute, you just, as your
know, I don't blame you, you up.

2412
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:37,740
We're trying to get indoctrinated.

2413
02:23:37,741 --> 02:23:40,980
What if you've been indoctrinated by
Europe by the ideas that you're exposed to

2414
02:23:40,990 --> 02:23:44,870
it because what I want you to guys, you're
identical. You both put on dot. Yeah.

2415
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:48,180
You both been indoctrinated with
ideas both that are separate.

2416
02:23:48,181 --> 02:23:52,020
Both that are probably wrong because most
of the information we get is not based

2417
02:23:52,021 --> 02:23:53,850
in truth. Your own point. Not Most.

2418
02:23:56,620 --> 02:23:59,970
I didn't give you an idea what I
just said was how I get my news,

2419
02:23:59,971 --> 02:24:03,880
which is from several different
sources. I'm with Ya. Who are,

2420
02:24:03,881 --> 02:24:08,760
who are one who doesn't. One is not not
run by a profit motive what like NPR,

2421
02:24:08,761 --> 02:24:12,900
national public radio that relies on
contributions from its listeners like me.

2422
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:14,160
So,
okay.

2423
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:17,970
And then you've got the New York Times
leftwing I disagree with a lot of it all

2424
02:24:17,971 --> 02:24:21,330
the time. Then you've got,
then you've got the economist,

2425
02:24:21,390 --> 02:24:24,060
then you've got time magazine.
All competing. By the way,

2426
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:28,790
we're all competing for the story.
So to say that I am, I'm in,

2427
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:30,690
I had the same doctors.
Well I'm sorry,

2428
02:24:30,691 --> 02:24:33,900
your fundamental beliefs are based on
what you've learned and been exposed to.

2429
02:24:33,930 --> 02:24:37,050
Well, hold on and I will
dilate on that because what I,

2430
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:40,000
what I'm exposed to varies.
It's,

2431
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:45,030
I try to be as well rounded as I can.
And if that is being closed minded,

2432
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:49,560
I would like to hear what would
be considered open mind. No, no,

2433
02:24:49,561 --> 02:24:51,120
I just mean all of your beliefs.

2434
02:24:51,121 --> 02:24:54,410
Many of which much more of yours
that I believe with that Ed, he said,

2435
02:24:54,411 --> 02:24:56,080
no offense Eddie, I love you. Um,

2436
02:24:56,670 --> 02:24:59,010
are based on everything
you've learned in your life,

2437
02:24:59,070 --> 02:25:01,620
all the things you've been exposed
to this and my emotion too.

2438
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:06,480
Emotion built you a beliefs. Astrology,
let's just built you a belief system.

2439
02:25:06,481 --> 02:25:08,640
Just as Edy's has add,
he's everything.

2440
02:25:08,641 --> 02:25:11,460
He's been exposed to everything that
needs to learn to all the information.

2441
02:25:11,461 --> 02:25:14,880
Not just the information you're talking
about, but how you learn information,

2442
02:25:15,030 --> 02:25:19,830
how you gather ideas. All of those have
built you guys your own belief systems.

2443
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:22,620
And when you look at each other,
you're just shocked at the other one.

2444
02:25:22,621 --> 02:25:25,840
Can't see you're shocked at the other one.
Can't see your belief system,

2445
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:26,950
but he's just like you.

2446
02:25:26,951 --> 02:25:30,550
He has one of his own that are structured
and built upon every experience he's

2447
02:25:30,551 --> 02:25:33,880
had in his whole life. And he is sure
that everything he's saying is right.

2448
02:25:33,881 --> 02:25:36,260
Just as you both on,
it's a good second and you bolt.

2449
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:39,760
Neither of you can see that this
other guy just can't understand.

2450
02:25:39,761 --> 02:25:43,200
Cause I know the truth. And he does. Isn't
that great? That's how I feel. But yet,

2451
02:25:43,201 --> 02:25:45,250
and that's how he feels
and that's how he feels.

2452
02:25:45,970 --> 02:25:49,840
And that's what's going on
in North America and all
over the world. How I feel,

2453
02:25:49,841 --> 02:25:53,620
I don't think that's fair to compare
the [inaudible]. I don't think so.

2454
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:57,900
What I think is what I see
with Eddie is that he has so,

2455
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:01,560
so we all want to believe that we're
responsive to evidence. Getty does ideas.

2456
02:26:01,570 --> 02:26:04,780
We won't belong to be there were
scientific and in that we'd have our mind

2457
02:26:04,781 --> 02:26:06,460
changed based on the evidence,

2458
02:26:06,461 --> 02:26:09,620
but he can't change your mind and
you can't change his mind. But, but,

2459
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:12,800
but that's not true. That's not, that's
not a character resisting to me at all.

2460
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:17,000
I changed my mind all the time
based on the evidence now,

2461
02:26:17,070 --> 02:26:19,030
right now,
uh,

2462
02:26:19,610 --> 02:26:23,770
well I sent Eddie several sort of
what could be considered conspiracy,

2463
02:26:23,771 --> 02:26:26,860
but they were, they were reported by
mainstream. Some of the stuff was,

2464
02:26:27,170 --> 02:26:29,740
and you remember that we
were talking about recently,

2465
02:26:29,741 --> 02:26:34,540
I can't remember what type of
text message. No, no, no, no, no.

2466
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:37,330
This was something else. Yeah. And
it was a real one. Oh, it was fast.

2467
02:26:37,331 --> 02:26:40,510
Glenn Greenwald's article
in the Guardian about the,

2468
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:44,180
the government turning on Donald Trump

2469
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:50,290
substantiated reports,
clock political operatives hiring,

2470
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:55,060
you know, x intelligence officers
to discredit a candidate.

2471
02:26:55,390 --> 02:26:58,330
And this is happening and this
is what the biggest fear is.

2472
02:26:58,390 --> 02:27:02,260
What do we believe at this point we'll
all the fake news and we have to be very,

2473
02:27:02,261 --> 02:27:06,040
very vigilant about.
And so when I formulated an opinion,

2474
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:09,130
one of the great things about doing a
podcast is I'm found out all the time to

2475
02:27:09,131 --> 02:27:12,580
be wrong. I love that point
of view. And I'll be like,

2476
02:27:12,581 --> 02:27:15,250
I'll say something and people will
be like, Hey, by the way, bullshit,

2477
02:27:15,251 --> 02:27:18,790
because here's this, this, and I go, Geez,
that's embarrassing. I was wrong on that.

2478
02:27:18,791 --> 02:27:21,110
Great to be wrong,
just to get new information.

2479
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:24,850
So we have to all be willing to set that.
First of all,

2480
02:27:24,851 --> 02:27:27,640
I don't think all the people in
mainstream media or criminal, but you do.

2481
02:27:27,970 --> 02:27:29,590
I don't see any evidence for that entity.

2482
02:27:29,591 --> 02:27:32,920
I do see that sometimes
mainstream media is discredited.

2483
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:35,080
I do see sometimes that
they make mistakes.

2484
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:38,740
I do sometimes see sometimes like rolling
stone articles gets it really wrong.

2485
02:27:39,070 --> 02:27:43,210
And there are examples of course, of
mainstream media where they get it wrong.

2486
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:44,770
Sometimes they get it wrong very badly,

2487
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:49,050
but I have to believe is that in a
lot of times they get it right? Yeah.

2488
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:51,250
Because I mean,
just take a couple of things,

2489
02:27:51,251 --> 02:27:54,970
like if they're reporting on the war in
Syria and how many children are killed

2490
02:27:54,971 --> 02:27:59,971
and you see that you see pictures and
you see video of children crying in a

2491
02:28:01,231 --> 02:28:02,064
hospital,

2492
02:28:04,580 --> 02:28:07,780
it's just not the same when
you're that Eddie, Eddie, Eddie,

2493
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:10,840
you've got to stop doing that because
you're just trying to discredit what his

2494
02:28:10,841 --> 02:28:15,830
ideas are by making jokes about
it or mopping in or show. But no,

2495
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:19,810
you're munching your mocking and knew
you were mocking earlier saying you don't

2496
02:28:19,811 --> 02:28:22,040
believe it's how you indoctrinated.

2497
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:24,320
You were telling him that he's,
he's brainwashed.

2498
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:27,590
You were telling them that you're
mocking it instead of just having an open

2499
02:28:27,591 --> 02:28:30,560
conversation about the
possibilities. My point, although I,

2500
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:35,000
I'm probably 75%, uh, think like Brian,

2501
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:39,170
we all are just thinking
all of the information that
we've ever been exposed to

2502
02:28:39,171 --> 02:28:42,260
and we've built up a belief
system based on everybody has.

2503
02:28:42,530 --> 02:28:44,960
And when our belief systems don't mix,
we have a problem.

2504
02:28:44,980 --> 02:28:49,330
And that's the problem that I think Eddie
actually believes that wholeheartedly.

2505
02:28:49,620 --> 02:28:54,380
Yeah.
Mocking his thoughts by saying,

2506
02:28:54,381 --> 02:28:57,800
you're brainwashed, you're brainwashed.
Brainwashed. But he didn't say,

2507
02:28:57,801 --> 02:29:00,170
you're brainwashed. You've, you've said
it many times. What do you, what do you,

2508
02:29:00,171 --> 02:29:03,020
what is your expression then? Because
that's what I'm doing is paraphrasing.

2509
02:29:04,170 --> 02:29:06,110
What am I saying? You? Yeah, exactly.

2510
02:29:06,111 --> 02:29:11,111
You say he's written [inaudible]
it's not a rational debate,

2511
02:29:14,930 --> 02:29:19,640
the situation, and you really
don't know anything harsher than it

2512
02:29:22,580 --> 02:29:23,150
worked on you.

2513
02:29:23,150 --> 02:29:28,150
You're saying he's brainwashed in
responding to what you're mocking him by

2514
02:29:29,151 --> 02:29:30,540
saying that, you know, you're right,

2515
02:29:31,970 --> 02:29:35,090
but it's not the way we figure things out.

2516
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:38,180
It's just not because it's like
all of a sudden you pick teams,

2517
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:41,240
everybody tries to win. Look, I
did it a good chunk of my life.

2518
02:29:41,450 --> 02:29:42,710
It's just not the way to communicate.

2519
02:29:42,711 --> 02:29:45,500
It's a constant way that people do it
because nobody ever wants to be wrong.

2520
02:29:45,501 --> 02:29:48,230
And when you, when you get into
debates and becomes a mind a game,

2521
02:29:48,231 --> 02:29:50,120
as much as it becomes a conversation,

2522
02:29:50,330 --> 02:29:54,560
I'm saying that's really bad for everybody
and that it's really just like if you,

2523
02:29:54,561 --> 02:29:55,760
if you're still in it,

2524
02:29:55,880 --> 02:29:58,970
if you know your side is losing and you
know you don't have any facts on your

2525
02:29:58,971 --> 02:30:02,240
side and you're still in it,
you're fucking it up for everybody else.

2526
02:30:02,420 --> 02:30:06,090
But if you make sense, if you make
sense then you don't need all that you,

2527
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:08,900
you know it worked on you, you're
a, you're a fucking brainwash.

2528
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:10,310
You don't need all that.
If your,

2529
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:14,150
if your facts are in line and if you've
done exhaustive research on the subject

2530
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:18,920
and a lot when you just blanket throw
all mainstream media is CIA operation

2531
02:30:18,921 --> 02:30:21,440
mockingbird nine 11 was an inside job.

2532
02:30:21,441 --> 02:30:26,350
Chem trails got to go out
and actually billion babies.

2533
02:30:26,380 --> 02:30:29,840
So we're trying to solve problems
you meet. And so one of the problems,

2534
02:30:29,841 --> 02:30:33,080
like for example, healthcare, universal
healthcare, gun control, these things,

2535
02:30:33,530 --> 02:30:37,040
it's very, when you get into it,
it's really difficult to come in.

2536
02:30:37,370 --> 02:30:38,840
And we were talking with,
Joe and I were talking about this.

2537
02:30:38,850 --> 02:30:41,420
You can't know everything.
Control. Look at this right here.

2538
02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:43,220
Here's some conspiracy shit that's real.

2539
02:30:43,310 --> 02:30:47,690
Another Glenn Greenwald polled Washington
Post is richly rewarded for false news

2540
02:30:47,691 --> 02:30:50,350
about Russia threat while
public is deceived. Wow.

2541
02:30:50,450 --> 02:30:53,930
And Glenn Greenwald who
exposed Wiki leaks. Of course,

2542
02:30:53,931 --> 02:30:55,970
he's the guy who was the reason why

2543
02:30:58,010 --> 02:31:01,610
he works for the Washington
Post right now. He's, he has a,

2544
02:31:01,611 --> 02:31:04,400
an investigative journalist. These
are the kind of guys I love. No,

2545
02:31:04,401 --> 02:31:07,230
he doesn't work for the Washington
Post's investigative journalist. So he,

2546
02:31:07,231 --> 02:31:10,400
he doesn't work for the Washington
Post supported by somebody who has the

2547
02:31:10,401 --> 02:31:13,430
Washington Post. Who is he?
Who, no, he's The Guardian.

2548
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:18,840
The Guardian is essentially a British
leftwing mainstream news source.

2549
02:31:19,831 --> 02:31:22,560
But this is a classic
example. Now Eddie, he just,

2550
02:31:22,590 --> 02:31:27,400
he just exposed what would be considered
a conspiracy now and he's just,

2551
02:31:27,401 --> 02:31:31,770
the guy did the thing about Donald Trump.
But I mean,

2552
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:34,900
I'm saying, I'm saying, but this is a very
good example. This is an investigation,

2553
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:38,970
but I do, I do believe
that, uh, I do believe that,

2554
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:41,550
but he's on the payroll of the Guardian.
Some guys,

2555
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,750
some guys are are jumping ship and,
and doing the right thing,

2556
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:50,010
but he's the reason why Edward Snowden
got all that information out. That guy,

2557
02:31:50,011 --> 02:31:50,681
Glenn Greenwald,

2558
02:31:50,681 --> 02:31:55,681
I remember he works for a
[inaudible] body is a psychotic.

2559
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,950
Not Everybody is down with the program.
Some people are like,

2560
02:31:59,400 --> 02:32:02,840
they're coming forward. There's whistle
blowers but Obama, but he's not a whistle.

2561
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:08,010
He gets paid by the Guardian, you know,
legit journal. Some guys are legit,

2562
02:32:08,490 --> 02:32:12,540
never said, oh, I'm suspect
of all. I understand.

2563
02:32:15,810 --> 02:32:19,560
I believe, but he's mainstream. This guy
is mainstream as a get some mainstream,

2564
02:32:19,890 --> 02:32:24,210
all mainstream stuff. For me,
I, I'm skeptical but some, some,

2565
02:32:24,211 --> 02:32:28,860
I didn't say everything was false, just
some, some guys are growing a conscious,

2566
02:32:28,890 --> 02:32:32,080
I don't think there's anything wrong
with Eddie being skeptical. No.

2567
02:32:33,590 --> 02:32:38,310
Journalism journalism is
based on being skeptical.

2568
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:43,210
Michael Shermer is a skeptic.
You being a skeptic means I need,

2569
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:46,190
you told me something now I need to trust.
Is it fun?

2570
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:51,030
Was it three or five or six or between
three and six but the bottom line is you

2571
02:32:51,031 --> 02:32:55,260
should always be a spa skeptic as our
credible news sources because they say,

2572
02:32:55,290 --> 02:33:00,150
what was the news? What was the story?
What are you saying? Okay, I need sources.

2573
02:33:00,300 --> 02:33:02,090
I as the editorial,
as the,

2574
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:05,550
as the editor in chief or whoever
it is who okays these things,

2575
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:08,880
I have got to see tangible,
measurable proof,

2576
02:33:08,881 --> 02:33:12,980
which is why the rhinestones story
about the Uva case was such a big deal.

2577
02:33:12,990 --> 02:33:16,500
Now because they printed this story
was a made up story about rape,

2578
02:33:16,501 --> 02:33:20,610
about a gang rape that never took place.
No, there's no sexual assault history.

2579
02:33:20,611 --> 02:33:21,780
There was,
it was not real.

2580
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:25,320
It was all fake and they printed it and
they printed it because they didn't want

2581
02:33:25,321 --> 02:33:28,260
to ask the hard questions because it
dealt with something that was a taboo

2582
02:33:28,261 --> 02:33:29,760
subject,
sexual assault,

2583
02:33:29,850 --> 02:33:32,270
and they liked that as a catastrophic
failure of journalism. These,

2584
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:35,460
these checks and balances are in place
to make sure that we know the fucking

2585
02:33:35,461 --> 02:33:39,160
truth when it gets printed in
such a prestigious magazine
is a rolling stone and

2586
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:42,840
it gets dealt with right now.
It's still going on. Yes.

2587
02:33:43,850 --> 02:33:46,140
Let me ask you say get, they get
found out. Look at Brian Williams.

2588
02:33:46,170 --> 02:33:48,330
They get found out.
They get found out by their own,

2589
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:53,340
within their own organizations. They got
find out our scientists and professors,

2590
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:57,120
uh, is there a history of them being
bought and paid for some of them?

2591
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:05,430
Hold on a second. Let me,
let me, let me qualify that.

2592
02:34:05,550 --> 02:34:10,550
There have been tens of
millions of scientists over
the course of human history.

2593
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:16,800
There have been a small handful that
have been corrupt and those small handful

2594
02:34:16,801 --> 02:34:18,070
that had corrupted,
we have found

2595
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:20,320
out about the results
have been catastrophic.

2596
02:34:20,321 --> 02:34:23,440
What they've done has been horrific.
What they did with the sugar industry,

2597
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:25,930
what they did with tobacco,
what they did with,

2598
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:30,960
there's a lot of fucking now
the environmental catastrophes
that were downplayed

2599
02:34:32,171 --> 02:34:32,831
by scientists.

2600
02:34:32,831 --> 02:34:36,970
There have been some bought and paid
scientists 100% but that's just like

2601
02:34:37,390 --> 02:34:39,160
there's certain people that
are going to be corrupt.

2602
02:34:39,190 --> 02:34:43,150
The vast majority applied to the rules
of science. Dedicate that. Right.

2603
02:34:43,151 --> 02:34:46,600
So do you think that it's possible that
journalists are bought and paid for some

2604
02:34:46,601 --> 02:34:50,310
of them? There's absolutely
proof of that. That's why.

2605
02:34:50,590 --> 02:34:53,350
That's why you gotta be skeptical.
Like I don't know which one you want.

2606
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:57,900
You can be bought.
But Eddie smart,

2607
02:34:57,930 --> 02:35:02,070
that's way not in a paranoid hiding
in a fucking corner. No, but Eddie,

2608
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:03,880
you guys are full of Shit.
I love you.

2609
02:35:03,881 --> 02:35:07,420
But when you're talking about something
like the economist that you don't have

2610
02:35:07,421 --> 02:35:10,510
any information about it all set,
then you blanketly dismissed them.

2611
02:35:10,730 --> 02:35:13,900
That is where, that's where
it all started from. I said,

2612
02:35:14,170 --> 02:35:16,330
I don't know anything about the economist,

2613
02:35:16,420 --> 02:35:19,720
but it's mainstream media and if
they're speaking the same thing,

2614
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:22,900
everyone else is spewing
like CNN and see and

2615
02:35:24,910 --> 02:35:26,650
listen. That's just the way I am, dude.

2616
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:28,330
That's just the way that
they compete with these.

2617
02:35:28,350 --> 02:35:31,650
I'm not saying you should be that way.
I'm just saying, Hey, listen, you know,

2618
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:34,510
I try to help people. I said, listen,
you're being fucking honey dick.

2619
02:35:34,570 --> 02:35:37,270
You're being punked lake up.
I tried to do that,

2620
02:35:37,271 --> 02:35:40,800
but I'm not going to go crazy with it
after awhile. Zoned by the Rothschilds.

2621
02:35:40,860 --> 02:35:44,590
Well, can't shock me now
that doesn't shock me that,

2622
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:48,100
I mean it's a public company is Cadbury,

2623
02:35:48,101 --> 02:35:52,710
the Kennedy people and they make
great public has done by Rothschild

2624
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:57,460
to public means anybody shot.
So that's what I'm saying.

2625
02:35:57,461 --> 02:36:02,450
I'm saying when it's coming,
when, when scientists and uh,

2626
02:36:02,470 --> 02:36:05,680
professors have been bought and paid for
like big ones, like Ivy League schools,

2627
02:36:05,681 --> 02:36:07,810
like Yale scientist says this,

2628
02:36:07,870 --> 02:36:12,870
Harvard professor says this to push
some agenda or it could happen.

2629
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:16,350
And then there's, you know, and then
operation mockingbird, you kind of, you,

2630
02:36:16,450 --> 02:36:17,920
you can't ignore that,

2631
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:23,590
you know about it through
mainstream media. I'm just saying,

2632
02:36:23,591 --> 02:36:26,440
I don't know who's who and I'm just
getting wine. I don't know who's who.

2633
02:36:26,530 --> 02:36:30,550
And I know one, this is for
me, this is just me. For me,

2634
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:36,450
I'm 100% convinced the moon landings were
faked. You don't have to believe that.

2635
02:36:42,700 --> 02:36:47,370
There's no proof that the earth is flat,
but don't book until she,

2636
02:36:47,380 --> 02:36:49,500
but no, no, no, don't you. But that guy,

2637
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:53,640
hey listen,

2638
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:57,430
there is no proof that the earth is flat
where all the pictures of earth from

2639
02:36:57,431 --> 02:36:59,860
space,
CGI is ended by NASA.

2640
02:37:00,230 --> 02:37:05,230
It's the way our satellite stage
Johnson [inaudible] about flat earth is.

2641
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:13,260
I want to hear it so I'm
just going to flat out

2642
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:21,950
no. Why do you know why it's a
perspective issue. Do you know that? Why?

2643
02:37:21,951 --> 02:37:24,230
That's why they pieced together the
pictures of the earth because it's a

2644
02:37:24,231 --> 02:37:28,790
perspective issue based. The earth
is fucking gigantic space station.

2645
02:37:28,791 --> 02:37:31,160
You're not far enough away
to get the full earth and

2646
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:36,680
the bottom line when you should
miss as you want to take a chance.

2647
02:37:37,220 --> 02:37:41,250
We would watch every space document or
even can we look and had all this series,

2648
02:37:41,390 --> 02:37:45,360
the universe put one to 12 we
were so into it. I was stolen.

2649
02:37:45,410 --> 02:37:50,410
I would watch these star documentaries
all they just get every now and then I'd

2650
02:37:51,291 --> 02:37:55,670
watch it and I think it is weird
that we're watching 100% CGI,

2651
02:37:55,671 --> 02:37:58,370
like everything we're watching
because there's no actual footage,

2652
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:01,250
but that's because they don't have
the capability to fill it out.

2653
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:02,990
Know the names of the scientists.

2654
02:38:03,170 --> 02:38:05,960
I don't know the name of the
astronomer or the astrophysicist,

2655
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:07,550
but somebody figured this out.

2656
02:38:07,670 --> 02:38:10,760
They got something out there
taking radiation question.

2657
02:38:11,370 --> 02:38:15,230
Here's what I'm saying is what I'm saying
real quick, real quick or a flatter.

2658
02:38:15,240 --> 02:38:19,370
So when you look at the stars every night,
the Orion

2659
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:26,940
rush donor talk, dude, that's all. This
is definitely not stoner talk question.

2660
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:32,840
There's a question kind of like every
night we look up at the stars and we see

2661
02:38:32,930 --> 02:38:37,720
that the belt, that Orion belt
and we see that that north, Yup.

2662
02:38:37,910 --> 02:38:40,870
You see that Shit, right? Right. Do it
tonight. You and me holding the everyone.

2663
02:38:41,570 --> 02:38:44,240
Isn't that weird? Okay. Let's say
this is the sun right here. Let's say,

2664
02:38:47,720 --> 02:38:50,900
look man, I don't know why
this is pissing people off,

2665
02:38:50,990 --> 02:38:55,250
but this is the sun and the earth.
[inaudible] figured out any

2666
02:38:57,500 --> 02:39:02,270
question. I just want to ask
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

2667
02:39:02,330 --> 02:39:03,800
This is make fun of me with this.

2668
02:39:06,630 --> 02:39:10,480
Here's the setup, here's the earth,
and it takes a year to go around.

2669
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:12,760
We spin around,
that's mainstream everybody.

2670
02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:16,670
And then we got mercury and Venus
and Mars and Saturn out here.

2671
02:39:16,790 --> 02:39:20,140
So they're all going to Dallas. And the
solar system, according to mainstream,

2672
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:25,360
is that like a plain Wall Street son's
going around the Goddamn the earth is

2673
02:39:25,851 --> 02:39:30,851
spinning a thousand miles an hour and
it's going around the sun like 60,000

2674
02:39:31,251 --> 02:39:34,130
miles an hour. And then the sun's
going around the fucking black hole,

2675
02:39:34,131 --> 02:39:36,260
like 900,000 miles,
something like that.

2676
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:42,410
So it takes a year for the son, for the
earth to go around. Yeah, it's huge.

2677
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:46,130
It takes a year. So right here is
January and then right here, June, right.

2678
02:39:46,220 --> 02:39:50,300
So when the sun is facing,
when we're facing the sun,

2679
02:39:50,420 --> 02:39:54,050
it's daylight. And then when we
spin this way, it's nighttime.

2680
02:39:54,051 --> 02:39:55,100
So when it's nighttime,

2681
02:39:55,430 --> 02:39:59,930
the sun is over here and we're
looking at this side of the space.

2682
02:40:00,050 --> 02:40:01,550
We're looking at this side of the space,
right?

2683
02:40:01,730 --> 02:40:05,030
There's Orion belt that north star
every fucking night. It's there.

2684
02:40:05,510 --> 02:40:09,290
By the time we get to June over,
like when we're looking at this,

2685
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:13,040
this side of the universe,
what the fuck is on the other side?

2686
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:14,220
Why don't you read some books

2687
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:17,790
and get into it? No, no, no, no. I don't
want it. Don't hold us here hostage. No.

2688
02:40:17,791 --> 02:40:20,170
See these crazy questions. Listen,
you guys are still what I'm saying?

2689
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:25,770
Why after you need to
tie somebody figured out.

2690
02:40:25,780 --> 02:40:28,760
I don't know what it is,
but somebody figured it out.
It's just a question. Well,

2691
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:29,581
Eddie,
I don't know.

2692
02:40:29,581 --> 02:40:34,581
The answer does is on the other
and when in six months when the,

2693
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:37,860
when earth gets over here,

2694
02:40:38,430 --> 02:40:41,290
why is it still the same
and different areas,

2695
02:40:41,320 --> 02:40:43,200
but you want to guy hold
on a second all the time.

2696
02:40:43,201 --> 02:40:46,080
Do you understand that it's not.
There's a procession of the equinoxes.

2697
02:40:46,081 --> 02:40:49,860
There's a cycle and this cycle of
thousands of years they've mapped out.

2698
02:40:49,861 --> 02:40:52,500
They know exactly.
There's a wobble to the earth.

2699
02:40:52,501 --> 02:40:54,510
There's a changing in
the sky that we look at,

2700
02:40:54,630 --> 02:40:57,450
and it's one of the ways that they get
determined when you go back in history

2701
02:40:57,570 --> 02:41:01,020
and look at certain things that they
had lined up to certain constellations,

2702
02:41:01,021 --> 02:41:03,210
like in Egypt is one of
the ways they lined it up.

2703
02:41:03,300 --> 02:41:06,210
They line it up because they understand
that we're looking at a different area

2704
02:41:06,211 --> 02:41:07,700
of the sky every night.

2705
02:41:07,701 --> 02:41:11,640
It's slightly different and it changes
over the course of thousands a year for

2706
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:15,090
every night. We don't, you
shouldn't miss. It should be,

2707
02:41:16,070 --> 02:41:18,570
that should be a completely ready to fly
a plane and you shouldn't miss it when

2708
02:41:18,571 --> 02:41:19,261
you shoot a bullet.

2709
02:41:19,261 --> 02:41:21,600
Even I think snipers have to take into
account the curvature of the earth.

2710
02:41:21,770 --> 02:41:24,860
We're talking about flat. I'm not talking
about that. I'm talking about the stars.

2711
02:41:24,890 --> 02:41:27,660
Let's wrap this up. I gotta get out of
here. I really got to get out of here.

2712
02:41:27,661 --> 02:41:30,080
I can't do this flat though.

2713
02:41:37,130 --> 02:41:37,280
Perfect.
