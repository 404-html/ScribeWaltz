1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,420
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,253
Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:04,951
Thanks for doing it,

5
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:05,101
man.

6
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:05,934
I'm excited.

7
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,803
Uh,

8
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,680
did you have products and stuff
that's good to branch out,

9
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:11,290
dude,

10
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,570
I'll shit that I'm interested in.

11
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:12,870
Yeah,

12
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,621
just try it again.

13
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:13,950
But I,

14
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,750
I tried to keep myself interested.

15
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:16,584
I think that the,

16
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,570
I feel different when I get excited about
something like a new exercise or a new

17
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,730
hobby I'm trying or anything.

18
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:24,980
I get excited when I'm in,

19
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,730
so I try to spread that.

20
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,390
Yeah.

21
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,170
As much as I can.

22
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,200
Cause I tried to think I want to
get into other aspects of business.

23
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:34,410
And that's cool that you does stuff that,

24
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,870
that you're interested in.

25
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,110
Because I like comedy,

26
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,970
I talk about this and my light comedy,

27
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,670
but I understand that is fleeting.

28
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,870
So if everything in comedy went away
for you got supplements is shit.

29
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,201
Yeah.

30
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,730
But I don't think comedy is fleeting.

31
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,370
He really thinks,

32
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,950
I think it's like one of
the least fleeting leading.

33
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,670
But I'm just saying that's
maintenance that it needs maiden,

34
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:57,210
but thing is in the business like I'm
talking about where you know stuff might

35
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:57,901
be going well,

36
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,110
but then you now work it as much anymore.

37
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,530
I got a theory about that was that
I think that shits in the past.

38
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,890
Really?

39
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,070
Yeah.

40
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,390
I don't think that's
going to happen anymore.

41
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,970
I think guys would go away because
they wouldn't get gigs anymore.

42
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,230
They wouldn't get television shows.

43
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,064
They wouldn't get all these things,

44
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,140
but now everybody promotes themselves.

45
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,640
Everybody has a Twitter account.

46
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,720
Everybody has a website.

47
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,613
Everybody,

48
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,350
when you get fans now they
know where they can find you.

49
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,610
It used to be,

50
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,350
if you weren't on television way,

51
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,220
where did he go?

52
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:24,150
Where is this guy?

53
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:24,984
Where did he go?

54
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,890
Vanished.

55
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,470
You can't just go to his Facebook page
and read a blog that he wrote today.

56
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,370
That's fucking hilarious.

57
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,031
You know?

58
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:32,860
You can't go and watch a youtube clip
that he made when he was fucking around

59
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,230
his backyard with his dog.

60
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,243
That's hilarious.

61
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,930
All that shit is new.

62
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,560
Oh,

63
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,041
you know,

64
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:38,880
I don't confident.

65
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,770
I'm totally 100% confident.

66
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,810
As confident.

67
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,481
You're going anywhere,

68
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:43,121
Hannibal Burress,

69
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:44,500
but the top side and

70
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,260
you've inspired me to give my tiny bottles
of lotion for hotels business going

71
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,330
because that's what I'm passionate about.

72
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,050
I'm passionate about tidy bottles of
lotion and that seems like a stable

73
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,471
business.

74
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,250
People use it.

75
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,150
I want to get in that.

76
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,481
Yeah,

77
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:01,560
people do use it.

78
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,540
Someone's got to be
selling them that shit.

79
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,260
Yeah,

80
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,000
it's a good point.

81
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,480
And you have some better smelling stuff
that a smell and stuff and maybe some

82
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,520
jokes on the lotion.

83
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,150
That's okay.

84
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,661
Too funny though.

85
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:17,940
You don't want to do jerking off
with your lotion and cracking up.

86
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,430
No.

87
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,661
Yeah.

88
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:23,661
Not that you don't want to use in the
middle of it so you don't lose your

89
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,570
stroke.

90
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,041
You don't want to.

91
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,160
Dude loses his stroke when
you go limp while jerking off.

92
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,760
Man,

93
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,870
those are tough times,

94
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,270
like getting it up again
while you're jerking off.

95
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:33,421
Well,

96
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,590
that's just a lot of work,

97
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,620
but that's just if you focused,

98
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,280
if you really,

99
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,100
if you've really about
making it to your goal,

100
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,510
then you just power through.

101
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,590
That's really what it is.

102
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,700
It seems frivolous,

103
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,880
but it's really just an exercise
in achieving your goals.

104
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,650
Fall down nine times.

105
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,730
Get up nine times.

106
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,770
Why did I say they say get up
10 what the Fuck Are you idiots?

107
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,540
Because people fall down a lot.

108
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,440
Get brain damage.

109
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,470
It sounded like you're hurt.

110
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,760
You can't just fall down nine times.

111
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,700
You gonna get fucked up,

112
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:03,991
man.

113
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:04,270
Yeah.

114
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,190
Little kids fall down.

115
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,921
The words themselves.

116
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,091
What?

117
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:06,821
You're a grown man.

118
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,900
You gotta Fall Down Nine Times.

119
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:08,681
You're not going to break something.

120
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,340
Why are you falling?

121
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,761
So what's that?

122
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:10,594
What's the balance?

123
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,480
How are you getting tackled all
you just straight up fall it.

124
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,710
You got a bump Nissan?

125
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,000
No ankle week.

126
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,750
You've got a weak foot.

127
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:16,961
Yeah.

128
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:19,540
People got to get it
together to fall down.

129
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,171
Nine Times.

130
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:21,700
Get up 10 what are you saying?

131
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,150
Yeah.

132
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,080
How does that even work?

133
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,710
It does it.

134
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,041
I don't know.

135
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,120
I guess get up in the morning,

136
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,670
you count that one account
and getting up in the morning.

137
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,570
That's what they count.

138
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,570
You can't count that because you get
to count lying down in bed then too.

139
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,470
That's fallen down.

140
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,800
Yeah.

141
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,621
They gave her a bitch.

142
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:34,300
You went to sleep.

143
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,571
Yeah,

144
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,050
man.

145
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,940
So basically what I'm saying is,

146
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,451
fuck that.

147
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:37,661
Oh,

148
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,800

So thank you.

152
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:44,981
I'm glad you're here,

153
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,814

Congrats.

158

The nature of box.

159
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:01,570
Okay.
