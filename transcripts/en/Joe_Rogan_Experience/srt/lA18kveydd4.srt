1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,170
[inaudible]

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,033
when it comes to defending America,
it is not enough to merely have an 

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,863
American presence in space.
We must have American dominance in 

4
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,040
space.
So important.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,813
Very importantly,
I'm here by directing the Department of 

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,770
Defense and Pentagon to immediately 
begin the process necessary to establish

7
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,580
a space force as the sixth branch of the
armed forces.

8
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:43,204
That's a big statement.
We are going to have the air force and 

9
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:51,781
we are going to have the space force 
separate but equal.

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,510
It is going to be something so 
important.

11
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:59,200
General Dunford,
if you would carry that assignment out,

12
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,040
I would be very greatly on

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,163
look at Mike Pence.
Mike Pence has this look on his face 

14
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:07,824
like I'm going to be the president.
That's motherfuckers gone completely 

15
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:14,130
crazy and I'm going to be the president 
next.

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,050
That's is not have approval.
Look at his face.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,380
He's got the face of a guy who knows 
he's going to be the president.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,780
I give you are about to be awarded 
something.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,640
Like if there was some,
uh,

20
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,380
something you were about to get and 
you're like,

21
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,840
wow,
I worked my whole life for this and here

22
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:29,820
it is.
I'm going to get that thing right now.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,580
I'm going to be the fucking president.
He must be like,

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,240
this guy is never going to last eight 
years.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,090
And for sure he's going to win again.

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,030
Okay,

27
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,863
I'm going to be the president.
So you think for sure he wins again 

28
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,524
because is that because whoever the 
Democrats decided to put in is going to 

29
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,310
be an equal turd sandwich.
Again,

30
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,050
you're a super smart dude,
but you're also a brutal,

31
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,680
your big giant savage motherfucker.
Right?

32
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,603
So how many people have underestimated 
you because you're a big giant savage 

33
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:04,204
motherfucker.
Plenty talk stupid to you and act like 

34
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,860
you're a moron.
I'd say equal street fights.

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,900
Two fights in the UFC.
Yeah,

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,340
there's a lot of people,
right?

37
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,600
And just people in general,
like they'll get snotty,

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,340
take stevie at treat young black men.

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,350
But I think there's a certain part of us
that might be doing that with him.

40
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,110
I don't think he is.
I think he's really good at winning.

41
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,503
This is,
this is,

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,720
this is not a,
not an like an endorsement of him.

43
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,360
Um,
no caveats necessary.

44
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,253
I'm horrified by this immigration policy
of separating children from their 

45
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:47,080
parents.
I think that's subhuman.

46
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,220
His wife came out and said that was 
bullshit,

47
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,570
right?
Yeah.

48
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,800
His wife's an immigrant,
bro.

49
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,050
His wife barely speaks English.
It's chaos,

50
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:53,950
right?
It's crazy.

51
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,830
I hate,
I hate all that stuff.

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,870
These are just family,
so just people love each.

53
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,120
You got to keep them together.
If they break the lie,

54
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,580
you keep them together.
Get them Outta here if you want.

55
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:04,414
I mean,
if you want to send them back to where 

56
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:05,850
they came from,
if you're,

57
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,383
you're hell bent on that.
But taking them from their kids is 

58
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,723
subhuman.

59
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,680
I mean,
it's beyond,

60
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,053
it's not us.
It's not what we're doing in 2018 that 

61
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:16,714
aside all that aside,
he's probably going to fucking win 

62
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:19,714
again,
man.

63
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,080
I think he's probably gonna win again.
I think he,

64
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,043
he gets in these confrontations with 
people and they think he's adult and I 

65
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,680
don't think he's an adult.
I think he's,

66
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,660
there's no way he can be as successful 
as he's been.

67
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,550
I know he's had his ups and downs and 
shit like that,

68
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,310
but like what?
He just,

69
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,343
just,
the way he was able to dismantle all 

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,113
those guys in those Republican debates,
it didn't do what the fuck apart tore 

71
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,670
him apart.
They had no business.

72
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,350
They had no business doing that with 
him.

73
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:51,370
They just were too emotionally tied up 
in his responses.

74
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:54,940
There was so much negativity and energy.
It was like,

75
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,543
there's all this anxiety,
like a fight where a guy's in full 

76
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,790
panic,
you know,

77
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,624
you've seen like street fights,
especially guys just go in a full panic 

78
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,760
or even just talking shit and the school
yard,

79
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,540
you know,
like yeah,

80
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,680
one guy's getting bullied.

81
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,863
Boy,
he's got the crowd watching him and the 

82
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,350
other guy's like,
well,

83
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,630
but,
but your your fuck you man.

84
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,170
You know,
whatever.

85
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,891
He's like,
oh,

86
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:16,000
that ain't gonna work.
You know?

87
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,710
That's Kinda,
that's what the rest of it looked like.

88
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,090
Ted Cruz.
It's what they all looked like.

89
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,280
He's just been doing this his whole 
life.

90
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,090
He's been talking shit his whole life,
you know?

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,410
And he's got a lot of fucking 
supporters.

92
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,540
And if the economy keeps doing good,
man,

93
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,000
it's going to be a hard sell to put some
guy in there like Bernie Sanders who you

94
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,660
know all the right wing people think,
just want to give away all your money,

95
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,760
give away all your money to welfare 
brats.

96
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,620
Even the left was protecting against 
that.

97
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,370
Yeah,
right.

98
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,800
Cause there's still money.
Money on the left.

99
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,530
I should point out,
I know Jack Shit about politics.

100
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,393
It was very important to point out 
anybody that ever says you shouldn't be 

101
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,430
talking about politics.

102
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,880
That's crazy because anybody should be 
able to talk about whatever they want.

103
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,923
But what I shouldn't do is give anybody 
the impression that I know what I'm 

104
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,930
talking about.
Cause I definitely don't like if you had

105
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:05,764
to get meat explained to you how 
Congress and the Senate works and how 

106
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,110
long the terms are and what's,
what's the cat,

107
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,340
you know what,
what they have to do.

108
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,520
That'd be a sloppy ass fucking 
conversation.

109
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:16,960
Right?
I'm no political expert.

110
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,460
You know,
like Mike Pence is no MMA expert.

111
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,810
You know what I mean?
Like,

112
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,090
he probably could tell you who conor 
mcgregor is.

113
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,073
You know,
like that's probably like we have equal 

114
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,480
knowledge and government.
Yeah.

115
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,970
But still he might win just in terms of 
like games.

116
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,660
Good.
Yeah.

117
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,880
It's a game.
You definitely could look what did,

118
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,470
what is it?
It's a fucking game.

119
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,840
It's a game.
It's a very high stakes,

120
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,740
gigantic game where you're trying to win
a popularity contest.

121
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,233
He Won.
What do you think of the rock 

122
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,230
potentially becoming president?
One day that shit was,

123
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,850
that shit blew up and I was like,
wait a minute.

124
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,684
Now if you look at the current state and
it is a popularity contest and we want 

125
00:05:56,411 --> 00:06:00,380
somebody who can literally rock the Mike
has the gift of Gab.

126
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,363
Yeah.
But then you also have somebody who's 

127
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,650
doing a monetarian shit is as famous as 
fucking anyone has ever been.

128
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,170
Highest Pay Dude in Hollywood.
He so nice too.

129
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,420
Yeah.
That guy.

130
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,081
And you're like,
you don't,

131
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,630
you don't question his character.
Right Sweetheart?

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,940
Yeah.
He's a sweetheart.

133
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,200
You meet them in real life.
He's like,

134
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,710
dot.
To all these up motherfucker.

135
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,900
Big giant motherfucker.
I think you could do it.

136
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,793
He could when he could win,
especially if it was oprah's as vp and 

137
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:33,290
I'm not even fucking around.
Not saying it's a good idea,

138
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:33,830
folks.

139
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,040
Not what I'm saying.
I'm just saying you don't think that the

140
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,470
rock and Oprah could win you,
but who would,

141
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,483
who would be?
Women would get super pissed off if the 

142
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:45,380
rock was the president and Oprah was vp.
Oprah would have to say,

143
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:48,230
look,
she's potentially next in line.

144
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,230
That's not a bad thing.
She has mike pence nodding in approval,

145
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,123
but she won.
A lot of people would want her to be 

146
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:54,524
president.
Oprah to be the first female president 

147
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,860
to counter like the the first celebrity 
president being trump.

148
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,040
Oprah counters that with the first 
female celebrity president.

149
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,963
Ah.
See that's a big win with the Rock Vvp 

150
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,653
in that situation,
it was tough to get the rock to take a 

151
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,620
fucking bag cs.
I don't know about that.

152
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,590
That the rock is,
he's the rock.

153
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,690
It's tough to get him to take a back 
seat.

154
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,060
It would be fascinating to see what 
happens next.

155
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,210
That's what's going to be,
oh man,

156
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,440
how we're going to try to play this out,
how people are going to play this out,

157
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,274
the popularity contest aspect of it.
Cause it's just okay if it really 

158
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,820
devolves into that,
it holds like,

159
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:38,654
and here's the other thing,
how much of his regulations are helping 

160
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,280
w and what and what do we do now?
It has really fucked up.

161
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,710
Maybe permanent consequences to the 
earth.

162
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,840
That's true too.
Right?

163
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,733
But what,
what stuff have they implemented other 

164
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:59,300
than,
I know they did offshore drilling,

165
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,760
right?
That concerned a lot of people.

166
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,680
And it was explained better to me about 
the,

167
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,120
the monuments and the private land.
Uh,

168
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:13,230
I've read a bunch of different,
um,

169
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,083
on public land rather.
I've read a bunch of different takes on 

170
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,514
that.
And essentially what they did is bring 

171
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:23,870
it back to where it was before the Obama
administration changed it.

172
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,720
So it was,
it was listed a certain way.

173
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,050
And then when the Obama administration 
changed it,

174
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:30,884
they felt that was an overstep.
I don't know why and it doesn't seem to 

175
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,430
be,
um,

176
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,323
they haven't started any like mineral 
drills or oil drills or anything in 

177
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,700
these areas.
I don't know what they're doing,

178
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,890
but I dunno.
I Dunno if they're really just trying to

179
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:46,724
deregulate things more.
They feel like the government 

180
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,094
overstepped their boundaries or if they 
really have nefarious ideas and they're 

181
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:56,610
trying to like figure out a way to get 
some oil out of a river will tell.

182
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,361
Yeah,
man.

183
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:58,194
I mean there was that one place,
we've discussed it before up in Alaska 

184
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:05,050
were a lot of people were concerned that
there was going to be some drilling that

185
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,610
takes place near,
near where salmon live.

186
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,193
Like close enough that if it fucked up,
it could destroy this river when it 

187
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:14,694
fucks up.

188
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,830
That's the probably the best way to say 
it.

189
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,060
Right.
Because if,

190
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,830
if we,
if we don't do anything about it,

191
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,753
like say if you put a pipeline in the 
earth and he pumped oil through it and 

192
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,800
we don't do anything,
we just leave it there.

193
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,410
Just leave it there and we don't,
you know,

194
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:31,630
we don't visit it for 5,000
years.

195
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,330
What's this?
What's that going to be like?

196
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,150
So what does that mean?
It means you got to keep fixing it.

197
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,220
Okay.
So you put a whole,

198
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:40,054
you put a giant tube through the earth 
and you're pumping toxic ooze out of 

199
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,600
this tube.
And sometimes it gets into rivers and it

200
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,670
fucking kills everything.
And there's,

201
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,533
you want to run this fucking,
you want to run this tube under the 

202
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,260
river.
Okay.

203
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,380
And then what are you gonna do?
Like how many every year?

204
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,150
Every five years when,
how long?

205
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,910
How often do you check in and when you 
replace Shit,

206
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,270
how long those tubes last?
I Dunno,

207
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,320
they got to check it out.
I almost got into that.

208
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,270
What happens if there's an earthquake 
and those tubes break?

209
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,160
Fuck City Wyatt,
how does that work?

210
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,023
I don't know.
Jack Shit about how they pump the oil 

211
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:19,480
out.
Do you,

212
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:22,480
what were you gonna say?
Well,

213
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:26,440
it's um,
I mean it's a weird thing with,

214
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:28,660
we know for sure they're going to one 
day break.

215
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,823
Like we're making that toxic pipeline.
And we know for sure it's going to the 

216
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,210
earth's can just absorb it,
right.

217
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:35,410
Everything.
Fucking the roads,

218
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,390
everything,
everything.

219
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,880
Have you seen them show like,
uh,

220
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,953
a five year depiction of what would 
happen to where bridges if we stopped 

221
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,650
painting?
Yeah.

222
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,533
It looks like it happens overnight.
Wasn't there a show about this called 

223
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,430
the life after humans or something?
Yeah.

224
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,630
Was that on like nat geo or discovery,
something like that,

225
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,860
something like that?
Yeah,

226
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,590
there's a bunch of spots.
Uh,

227
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,260
particularly look at the southern 
California deadly as quick may have been

228
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:00,094
caused by oil drilling.
Jesus Christ in 33 dozen Oklahoma now 

229
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:08,170
have a ton of earthquakes from fracking.
Yeah.

230
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,890
But how could they know this?
Cause earthquakes happen out here.

231
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,140
I wonder how they know this.
Hmm.

232
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:19,570
The study written by two leading US 
Geological Survey,

233
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:20,404
Stein scientists in Pasadena,
shout out to Pasadena and be published 

234
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:27,600
in the bulletin of Seismic Society of 
America on Tuesday.

235
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:31,800
Also suggest that three other 
earthquakes including magnitude 5.0

236
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:32,634
earthquakes in 1920 in inglewood and 
1929 in whittier may have also been 

237
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,870
linked to oil drilling.
Whoa.

238
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,760
I Dunno.
Maybe,

239
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,760
maybe we live in California,
right?

240
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,620
Both.
Maybe both.

241
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,530
Maybe it gave a little bump,
but it was happening anyway.

242
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,410
Fuck knows.
But it is.

243
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,450
Um,
it's weird.

244
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,343
That's a weird one.
The weirdest one for sure is nuclear 

245
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,344
power plants.
That's the weirdest one because they 

246
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,104
can't shut him off.

247
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,993
When you had a Shane Smith on,
he was talking about that kid that made 

248
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:08,550
a nuclear reactor in his garage had like
17 years old.

249
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,430
He's like 22 or 23 works for the 
government.

250
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,353
What did they do?
They tracked him by the materials that 

251
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:17,880
he was purchasing,
shut down a fucking city block when he,

252
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,790
when he turned,
but he was doing like fusion.

253
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,270
Maybe he could do a,
was that he could refine uranium.

254
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,580
Oh Jesus.
He knew how to fucking mine it.

255
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,610
Get all the materials in the 17 that was
at 17 he's 22 now or 23 that's insane.

256
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,913
But he can take the used reactors and 
basically like a handheld battery like 

257
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:41,550
you'd have on an RC car that can power 
an entire city for 10,000

258
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:42,630
years.
Each one of those.

259
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,250
That's what Smith was saying.
Well I know though,

260
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,293
that's what Shane Smith was saying.
This guy has that technology and of 

261
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:53,700
course you know they're there to get a 
little Eddie Bravo ish.

262
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:55,500
You know there's,
there's big companies that don't want to

263
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:56,334
see that happen but he supported by Elon
Musk and another other big time dudes 

264
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,320
that want to see it happen.

265
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,623
Well he would be the thing you,
I don't know if once those nuclear 

266
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:11,150
reactors get up and running like the old
style ones like Fukushima,

267
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,240
I don't know if they have like a way to 
shut those down.

268
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,510
You know,
I think they need ironically enough,

269
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:19,730
I think they need power to shut him 
down.

270
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,063
It wasn't that like a big part of the 
problem with Fukushima where they 

271
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:26,570
couldn't call it,
they couldn't keep it cool dude.

272
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,940
They can't shut them off.
Like that is the crazy.

273
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:30,774
They've only had them for,
if you stop and think about the amount 

274
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:36,560
of time humans have been alive,
it's only been like

275
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,543
50 years,
60 years since like nuclear powers 

276
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,660
everywhere.

277
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,630
Like what is the been the year for the 
bomb was dropped.

278
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:50,340
And what was that 45 is that in 1945 I 
don't know before my time.

279
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,390
Right.
Your honor,

280
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,440
when you take the bomb was dropped.
Was it 45 Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

281
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,780
I think that's right,
but I'm sorry I was looking up that they

282
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:01,200
shut down power plants in Florida when 
the hurricane went through last year.

283
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,850
Nuclear power plants.
Yeah,

284
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:03,684
I think new ones they can,
I don't think they could shut down the 

285
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:06,264
Fukushima one or I think it was just 
damaged by the water so badly that 

286
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:13,170
whatever they're shutdown thing didn't 
work,

287
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,830
but there's no like there's no way to 
shut it down now.

288
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,550
Now it's the fucking total meltdown 
disaster.

289
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:21,990
I mean,

290
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,360
okay.

291
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,940
They've tried to come up with all sorts 
of ways to store this shit.

292
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,013
Dee.
I think one of them was dig a giant 

293
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,054
hole,
pour all the waste in there and keep it 

294
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,510
frozen.
That doesn't sound good.

295
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,783
That sounds like a really bad idea.
You're going to put it in like this 

296
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:35,974
giant Vat and they were going to have 
this vat like super cooled to some like 

297
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:44,770
ridiculous,
a low degree and do something,

298
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,440
correct me if I'm wrong,
it sounds like I'm making this up.

299
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,680
I've got Paul stamets could come up with
a way to fix that.

300
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,070
How would you fix

301
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,903
that?
Mushrooms eat all the nuclear waste 

302
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,250
doing the,
he did that.

303
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,940
He had the Ted talk a six ways mushrooms
will save the world and it was at one of

304
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,774
his,
one of them was oyster mushrooms eating 

305
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:02,264
away oil spills.
So he fucking has like three giant vats 

306
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:07,694
of toxic waste.
I wouldn't say toxic like garbage and 

307
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,084
uh,
they're all coated in oil and he does 

308
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:15,380
different things to two of them.
And then on the third one,

309
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,800
he puts oyster mushroom spores in there 
and they cover him.

310
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,590
And the other two distinct to fucking 
hell.

311
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,870
Like they get worse over time.
Wow.

312
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,753
The oyster mushrooms grow and they grow 
black as the oil starts to be absorbed 

313
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:30,560
by them.
Then they break down every single carbon

314
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,053
in the oil until eventually the oyster 
mushroom becomes white again and it's 

315
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,684
fucking edible lately.
Breaks it down and these are giant 

316
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,250
oyster mushrooms like just fucking 
massive to do.

317
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,320
You going to get BP cocky.
They're going to,

318
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,840
they're going to get cocky.
Like,

319
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:48,920
look,
we spell it.

320
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,890
We've got some fucking mushrooms.
We're good.

321
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,590
You guys give us three months.
Damn.

322
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:57,980
Could you imagine a giant oil spill out 
in the ocean?

323
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,940
And then the scientists drop like 
billions of spores.

324
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,940
What does this gentleman know that might
not working in the ocean?

325
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:05,774
Which can you imagine if they did do it 
and it did work and you see these 

326
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,420
fucking building size mushrooms just 
sucking oil out of the ocean.

327
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,040
That'd be awesome.
That'd be crazy.

328
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:16,874
And then they turn white and they become
edible and then just got to figure out 

329
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:22,100
how to do that with psilocybin and we're
golden.

330
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,020
Wow.
Yeah.

331
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,090
That would be an easy fix to find some 
way to blend the two of them together.

332
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,060
Don't Crongo crossbreed could they do 
that?

333
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,680
I know they do that with plants,
right?

334
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,460
They gotta be able to do that.
How do they do that with plants?

335
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,470
Because they,
you know,

336
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,410
someone told me that blew me away that 
there was um,

337
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,693
there were,
there were making pistachio trees and 

338
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:48,494
they were binding them somehow or 
another to avocado trees and they were 

339
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:58,160
making them like grow together to make 
like a sturdier branch structure.

340
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,870
And what I've seen do that,
you could mix trees.

341
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,990
I know here they have mixed trees but 
they're from the same like file them.

342
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,103
I don't know if that's right.
They're close enough genetically 

343
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,490
related.
But you'd have like one base of the tree

344
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,353
that has the roots and then different 
branches on that tree grow different 

345
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:19,010
fruit.
Why are you going to have four different

346
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:22,370
fruit styles on one tree?
Like peaches,

347
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,600
plums,
apricots,

348
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,000
all from one tree.
Wow.

349
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,863
Dude,
I had no idea you can buy that shit at 

350
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,070
Costco.
I believe you.

351
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,160
I had no idea though.
I would have assumed that.

352
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,970
I would assume that like a tomato has to
be in a tomato tree.

353
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,180
You know that you can't splice it.
Tomato juice,

354
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,510
an apple tree tomato might not work.
But as far as fruit trees.

355
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,690
So would be cool though to do that and 
maybe you could do that with tomatoes.

356
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,220
Maybe could have beef steak on one side 
and cherry

357
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,690
on the other.
Yeah.

358
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:52,524
Right.
Possible.

359
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,390
Right.
You can have it all mixed up together.

360
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,863
Yeah.
It's just what a strange life form 

361
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,020
plants are bizarre compared to us.
It's thing that lives alongside of us.

362
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,153
Queens are ar for us cleans our air like
New York without central park would be 

363
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:13,340
so much grosser probably.
Right?

364
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,233
Yeah.
100% have to be like all the carbon in 

365
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,350
the air.
Carbon dioxide,

366
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,460
all the fuck.
Just all the people breathe and everyone

367
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:23,960
around you.
There's so many people,

368
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:24,794
everyone just breathing.
You're going to like a soup of people 

369
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:28,184
breathing on the subway and in buildings
and you know people are so jam next to 

370
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:35,840
each other whether walking by,
they just breed in each other's air.

371
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,510
That is such a weird way that people

372
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,540
blue decided to live.
Yeah,

373
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,374
it is weird.
We were just out there for a product 

374
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:47,390
development with on it and get to go out
to different conferences and shit.

375
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,973
So when not to Secaucus New Jersey and 
they're like a giant supplement 

376
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:53,054
conference where they have a,
it's basically like people that do the 

377
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:58,424
science,
they figured out something really cool 

378
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:01,790
but they're not big enough name to take 
it to the masses.

379
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,430
So they,
we come in along with other companies,

380
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:06,470
we look for different things that are 
backed by science,

381
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:08,120
piece it all together and create 
something new.

382
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,223
So we're doing that by day and then we 
head over to a New York by night and it 

383
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:14,120
was cool,
but it was like,

384
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,813
it's a fucking mad house.
Absolutely insane to think that people 

385
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:21,400
live on that tiny little island.
They love it.

386
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,500
Yeah,
it definitely buzzes.

387
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,393
It's got,
it's got it's own fucking energy for 

388
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:26,370
sure.

389
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,660
For sure.
For sure.

390
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,800
And it's a little hostile.
There's a hostility to that.

391
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,200
The comedy there is a,
it's,

392
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,130
it sort of exemplifies that New York 
comedy,

393
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:40,890
it's always been some of the best comedy
in the country.

394
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,350
Like oh ways.
It's always been some of the best comics

395
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:47,760
come out in New York and a lot of them 
are like super hyper aggressive.

396
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,553
Like a lot of them like real insult 
comedians like that Kinda that style of 

397
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:57,390
shitting on each other.
So like they're,

398
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:58,224
they're aggressively like that,
but it's like patrice o'neal was 

399
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:01,674
probably like the best at it.
He was so fucking good and he was so 

400
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:04,944
fucking good.
But he exemplifies that New York style 

401
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:09,870
of,
what the fuck are you wearing man?

402
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,470
What the fuck is that shirt?
And then it would just be an attack.

403
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,660
And it was beautiful.
It was beautiful.

404
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,770
It was,
but it was fun.

405
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,410
It was all like in good fun and playful 
and,

406
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:22,230
but that New York style is,
um,

407
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,170
it's like a harder style,
like a more aggressive style.

408
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,033
Yeah.
Even families talk to each other 

409
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:27,790
differently there.
Yeah,

410
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,541
yeah,
yeah.

411
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,730
Were shit talking.
Well,

412
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:30,564
you know,
I've tried to figure this out myself 

413
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,364
because my grandparents were immigrants,
but I figured the way I was thinking it 

414
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,550
is like if you really thought about the 
kind of people that were taking a chance

415
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,530
to come across the ocean and get here in
like 1920,

416
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,770
like these were wild,
desperate people.

417
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,170
I,
this was a different kind of human,

418
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,110
they were there,
a wilder type of human being.

419
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,543
And then to go from that wild type of 
human being to like a regular person in 

420
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,360
2018 it's only been a couple of 
generations.

421
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,823
Those places is where the people stayed.
So the people landed there first and 

422
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:11,254
then all of that,
how the Polish and the Jewish and the 

423
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,770
Italian and the Puerto Ricans and all 
these different different fucking ethnic

424
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:19,360
group just piled in together.

425
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,310
Just buzzing.
And a lot of people went,

426
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:24,460
let's go west.
What's fucking go west?

427
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,683
And they landed over here and this is 
why California is like a quite a bit 

428
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:32,440
more mellow,
you know,

429
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,080
quite a bit more laid back.
And even the comedy,

430
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:37,180
the comedians are more friendly.
It's not like,

431
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,850
but there is a great roast battle scene 
up here too.

432
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,570
They do those roast battle shows.
Those things are pretty God damn good.

433
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,660
I love the roast.
They get nasty with each other.

434
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,720
You guys sit in the back of the comedy 
store and Talk Shit,

435
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,381
right?
Yeah.

436
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:52,600
We talk shit to each other,
but it's fun.

437
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,463
It's practice.
It's like we're making other comedians 

438
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:56,440
laugh.
Awesome though.

439
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,274
To be a fly on the wall,
watching a bunch of comedians just talk 

440
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:00,960
shit to each other.
Not even worried about other people,

441
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,400
not trying to make anybody laugh with 
themselves.

442
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,360
We all talk shit and less joey's around.
Then when Joey's around,

443
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,540
just try to get them riled up.

444
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,283
When Joey's around,
my main goal is try to get them angry 

445
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:14,284
about something and just does hear him 
go off and that's when the magic 

446
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:17,974
happens.
It's gotta be something you've got to 

447
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:23,290
bring up some fucking band he doesn't 
like or some food.

448
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,124
That's bullshit.
And next thing you know he's throwing 

449
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,264
his arms back and he's fucking,
somebody orders the ranch sauce with 

450
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:33,250
their salad.
Chicken wings.

451
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,380
Chicken wings.
Yeah,

452
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,793
just that one statement.
It's blue cheese with wings or go fuck 

453
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:43,201
your mother is and it's just the way he 
says it to.

454
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,123
So when,
when we're in the back of Joey's back 

455
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:47,980
there,
we just let joey rant.

456
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,963
We just tried to get him riled up.
I mean we'll have conversations with 

457
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,710
them.
It was just once I have a conversation,

458
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,740
but half the time it's like a game of 
uh,

459
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,840
you know you're hanging around with the 
funniest guy ever.

460
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,290
If you can get that guy to laugh and get
that guy to make everybody laugh,

461
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,410
just fucking poke and prod.
Yeah,

462
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,390
just have fun with them.
But he would always do that.

463
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:08,224
Like no one could figure that out.
We do these gigs in the road and right 

464
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:13,120
before joey would go on stage,
she get mad at us.

465
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,490
He'd get mad at me for whatever reason.
He goes,

466
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:16,324
you got what?
This fucking laptop and this bull shit 

467
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:19,474
in the fucking grip.
Pick the fucking grain ground breaking 

468
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,890
from Beta Green Room.
So what are you gonna do?

469
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,510
You're gonna show me a dick.
Are you going to do it?

470
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:26,980
And he would like go into this thing 
like how,

471
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,330
how deep you're going to get into these 
fucking internet life left these fucking

472
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:34,750
people behind the scenes would just go 
off and they were like,

473
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:36,040
why is she,
why is Jojo man,

474
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,380
but he's can fire it up to go on stage.
So he does comes back.

475
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:40,214
He's not mad at you cause this.
He just decides like this is what it's 

476
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:43,534
going to be.
Ambassadors like I'm just to do some 

477
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:46,250
emails

478
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,770
just streaming on on Youtube.
What's his deal?

479
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,010
What the fuck is this drain been?
What the fuck is that?

480
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:52,844
What the fuck are these kids doing?
What the fucking stream and the next 

481
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:55,964
thing you know,
boom,

482
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,250
Bang.
Everybody's on the floor dying,

483
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:00,770
laughing.
He would get fired up and then you go on

484
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:04,760
stage already at 10 you know,
is it really smart thing?

485
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,983
Just get mad.
Just get annoyed right before you go 

486
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:08,960
onstage.
Just get annoyed at anything.

487
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,690
What kind of fucking mustard is what 
cut?

488
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:14,120
Joe Rogan.
What kind of fucking mustard is this?

489
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,150
Back in jersey,
they had the mustard,

490
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,830
put the seeds that fucking brown,
dirty mustard oil.

491
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,930
Ivanka came out of someone's ass hole 
and he would just,

492
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,390
whatever it was,
he would just start ranting about it and

493
00:24:27,391 --> 00:24:30,900
get angry and then he'd go on stage like
at 10 so it could be anything,

494
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:31,350
man.

495
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,000
It can be a fucking TV show.
The Tahani,

496
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:35,430
he doesn't like.
It could be the pair of sneakers.

497
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:36,840
You're wearing.
It could be.

498
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:38,490
I don't like the way you're doing your 
notes.

499
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,353
He'll just say,
he yelled at me once for having a 

500
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:44,330
notebook.
I came to the Improv,

501
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,110
had a fucking notebook and he was 20 
dude,

502
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:48,050
what the fuck and notebook.
And I go,

503
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,530
it's not,
that's why I keep my notes.

504
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,520
And he's like,
what do you want?

505
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:53,220
Everybody know you're writing.
Carry this fucking notebook around.

506
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,763
Get it.
You're doing it to show the world that 

507
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:59,820
you're taking your job serious.
Some people do,

508
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,010
but I mean,
that's better than not doing it.

509
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,990
You know?
Even if you're like fit,

510
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,350
even if you're writing to fake that 
you're writing all the time,

511
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,960
just that's definitely better than not 
writing.

512
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,270
Carry that notebook,
man.

513
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,380
Courage.
No books.

514
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,273
I'm all,
I'm pro notebook and you guys got the 

515
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:17,040
notepad right here,
dude.

516
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:20,010
You got to write shit down.
Don't look at 90% of it.

517
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,890
There's a lot of stuff in here that I 
have no idea what the fuck I wrote,

518
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,940
but occasionally I feel like one day I'm
going to get it.

519
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:28,110
I'm going to be,
I'm going to wise up,

520
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:28,944
but I'm gonna go in here and I'm going 
to go over these notes and something's 

521
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,870
gonna make some sense,
but nope,

522
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,070
all looks like nonsense chicken scratch 
of nonsense page after page of it.

523
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,500
Kyle Kingsbury,
do you take notes?

524
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,000
Like life notes?

525
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,721
Kind of.
I mean,

526
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:49,670
I have two journals that I use for 
psychedelics ceremony,

527
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:51,020
Shit like that.
Uh,

528
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,450
and then my desk is,
it's kind of a fucking joke.

529
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,910
I mean it's just covered in postits and 
I'll just jot shit down on who I'm going

530
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:00,744
to have on the podcast or the supplement
that I want to try and what dose that I 

531
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,604
tried it at,
that kind of shit since I'm kind of the 

532
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,270
office Guinea pig,
just any,

533
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:11,160
any bullshit,
but they're fucking everywhere.

534
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,100
Have you ever had an adverse reaction as
an office?

535
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:15,450
Guinea pig?
Trying shit out?

536
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,010
Many,
many times.

537
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,920
I was it a meeting with Aubrey and I 
forget the guys that were there,

538
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:23,010
but there was some big wig guys and uh,
you know,

539
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:25,050
I show up and he's like,
hey,

540
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:26,430
you doing all right?
And I was like,

541
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,510
ah,
no,

542
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,810
no,
I'm not doing good.

543
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,760
And I had taken,
um,

544
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,180
I'd taken this form of Berberine that 
lowers blood sugar,

545
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,043
kind of works like metformin.
Dr Peter t has talked about that before 

546
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:44,010
in your show and I'm supposed to help 
ketone production

547
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,050
and just inflammation,
all that good shit.

548
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,810
But I took way too much.
I kind of eyeballed it.

549
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,430
She said,
I got cocky,

550
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,081
cocky.
Yeah.

551
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:55,320
I've probably had three times the dose 
and it just fucking sunk me.

552
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,760
And I'm like,
I'm already in Ketosis.

553
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:59,670
I should be fine.
And I went pale as a ghost.

554
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:00,360
And he's like,
why?

555
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,010
Uh,
[inaudible] got a couch in his office.

556
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:02,844
He said,
why don't you just lay on the couch for 

557
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:03,991
a minute,
you know?

558
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:06,240
So I laid down there fucking full body 
sweat,

559
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,820
it got worse.
And I just listened and then I was like,

560
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,150
ah,
yeah.

561
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:13,200
It kind of close to fucking throwing up.
But uh,

562
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,610
and that's like one of probably 10.
How can you eyeball things?

563
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,200
You're a smart guy.
That's true.

564
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,063
Well,
I've Shit my pants or my ball and mct 

565
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,014
oil multiple occasions.
So we talked about that last bought 

566
00:27:24,741 --> 00:27:25,290
house.

567
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,960
Dude's got so mad.
Yeah,

568
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:32,090
I'll try your dart and shoot my fucking 
pants mad and not take mct oil.

569
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,273
You don't have to.
Or you can do it intelligently and 

570
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:39,510
fucking measure your dose and not get 
Ballsy,

571
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,710
you know?
But if you're,

572
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,480
if you're in the average human being,
let's just say you're an intelligent,

573
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,180
let's be super honest about this.
If you're an intelligent,

574
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,350
healthy person that eats a reasonably 
balanced diet,

575
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,980
you still have a 1% chance of shitting 
your pants every day.

576
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,990
And you think it's that high?
No.

577
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,660
Cause that's the one day out of every 
hundred.

578
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:06,630
Yeah.
That's like three times a year.

579
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:08,370
No,
I have to revise my number,

580
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,410
maybe one 10th of 1%.
One in 1,001

581
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:15,244
in a thousand days.
So if it's one and a like one in three 

582
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:19,530
years,
you've got to,

583
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,440
there's a likelihood I think I'm living 
right.

584
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,300
If I shit my pants once every three 
years,

585
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,070
if for you,
glad you said that,

586
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:26,904
not me.

587
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,690
Yeah.
If I don't,

588
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,110
if I don't push the envelope and you're 
not taking that chance.

589
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,123
Yeah,
exactly.

590
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,230
I'm not playing it safe.
Nope.

591
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:36,240
Not playing it safe.
That's odd.

592
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,723
Yeah.
It's weird that certain foods that are 

593
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,374
good for you.
We'll also make you shit your pants if 

594
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:42,654
you do it wrong,
so like your body wants this real nice 

595
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,750
balance.
I want a real nice balance of nutrients.

596
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:52,080
Don't get fucking crazy with this stuff.
Come on.

597
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,940
Don't go crazy with that.
What's all the oil?

598
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,530
What does it look?
How did you want diarrhea?

599
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,880
You want diarrhea,
motherfucker.

600
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,490
Wow.
Your body just says,

601
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,340
I'm not dealing with this.
Let's just flush it out.

602
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,520
The problem is that you think it's a 
fart and you should know better.

603
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:06,151
You know?
It's like,

604
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:07,260
oh,
that feels like air.

605
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,860
We're good to let this out and then it's
not so much underwear.

606
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,720
You can walk.
Not Good.

607
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,780
Then you've got to drive home with your 
hips off the seat the whole way.

608
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,643
It's good exercise though.
For your lower pelvic [inaudible] 

609
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,733
activate,
loosen up the front side it mail key 

610
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,750
eagles.
You're kind of doing a Kegel,

611
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:25,680
holding it back.
Yeah.

612
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,810
You are definitely.
Yeah.

613
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,060
Just stay in puckered for an extended 
period of time,

614
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,073
like women to do that competitively.
Do you know that there's like 

615
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,330
competitions,
the golden carrot?

616
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,940
Yeah.
Those are some dedicated people.

617
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,860
Like I would imagine most girls are like
Regina is great by itself.

618
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,030
You don't really have to squeeze it 
until come some muscular.

619
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:50,850
You can't train itself.
You can't,

620
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,713
you know you can't,
but how many trained in the brain you 

621
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:54,730
can,
but how many people do it?

622
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,653
I would like to know,
I believe if there was an anonymous 

623
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:57,814
thing where women can answer,
I bet that 1% how many of them squeeze 

624
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,420
their pussy all the time and just do 
exercises.

625
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,293
Like look at this girl.
She's got some stuff up or Punana and 

626
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:15,490
then she's carrying weights around and 
she's doing yoga record padding,

627
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:18,190
vaginal weightlifter.
What's wrong with the pants?

628
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,740
Well,
there's a hole in the middle of it where

629
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,900
that rope goes through.
That's one thing.

630
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:24,670
It's,
that's a rough looking rope.

631
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:26,730
Tude man,
that's like a rope that you would,

632
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,750
you would tie like a dog to a tree with 
this.

633
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,760
That's all I got.
Silk Rope.

634
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,890
That's a fucking rope,
man.

635
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,200
He's not bad.
I don't,

636
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,600
I really don't like the pants.
This is,

637
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,570
it's nice that she's moving through 
different positions.

638
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:48,850
You know?
She's not just standing there hitting,

639
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:50,170
she gone with it in there.
She's,

640
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,730
she's actually,
she's working it.

641
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,593
This is the sexual equivalent to you 
taking that overdose of those pills or 

642
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:00,000
of the of that you were taking?
The powder.

643
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,820
Actual equipment is exactly the sexual 
equivalent because you don't want to get

644
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,560
jerked off by the hulk.

645
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,860
Okay.
I don't know.

646
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,030
I can't knock it until you've tried it.
I would just,

647
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,560
I would enter that and roll the dice and
see how strong that is.

648
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:18,040
What does she grabs it like your fist 
and you're like,

649
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,280
oh Jesus.
She's like Pie may when he takes the arm

650
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,720
cocked back wrap,
but longstanding grabs it like it hurts.

651
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:26,620
Like,
hey,

652
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,830
hey,
well it's still going to be wet,

653
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:31,030
right?
Hopefully.

654
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,380
Sure.
Yeah.

655
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,330
I mean everything seems to be in working
order.

656
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

657
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,640
That's a weird thing to want to be able 
to do to carry the most weight with your

658
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:42,760
pussy.
How cute you look to see what,

659
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,773
how did it go from that being a thought 
in your mind to one day I'll be the 

660
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:49,150
queen.
One day I will care the most way to like

661
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:53,470
put it a putting it on youtube and 
figuring out a way to put it on youtube.

662
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,580
We have pants that have a hole in them 
somewhere.

663
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,433
Yeah,
but I'm willing to bet that seed was 

664
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:03,700
planted early on in life.
Probably too early maybe.

665
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,240
I Dunno man.
Different strokes for different folks.

666
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,240
Right.
If that's true to doing,

667
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,403
some people play tennis.
Some people are world record pussy wait 

668
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:20,731
holders like what the fuck man.
Okay.

669
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,600
If dudes could grow their dicks first.
Sure.

670
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,330
If there was an exercise that you told 
me Your deck,

671
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:29,164
you've talked about that,
but their tribes in Africa where they 

672
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:31,474
hang shit from there they got a penis 
head piercing and they hang different 

673
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:36,040
weights from their cock.
There is some of that,

674
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,950
right?
It's stretch it out like it's the same.

675
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,793
They do like Dick Games where though 
there'll be semi hard and they kind of 

676
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,710
work those muscles on top of the cock to
flex the the weight up and down,

677
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:46,544
Huh?

678
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,713
Yeah.
But if that was like a straight forward 

679
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:50,883
site,
the penis has to be a wrecked in order 

680
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:56,610
for it to be hard and if it's erect and 
holly,

681
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,990
if it's not a muscle you could work out 
and who has what I'm saying?

682
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,190
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

683
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:02,960
It's more about just stretching it.
Yeah.

684
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,843
Like,
but if you had a weightlifting exercise 

685
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:06,974
for the Dick,
like a bicep curl you how big the 

686
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:15,110
fucking line at the gym would be.
If someone invented that,

687
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,453
no one would be wait in line for the 
stair master right there would be 

688
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:22,430
waiting in line to get on that dead Dick
Building machine.

689
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,683
All these dudes are their pants around 
their ankles stuffed into a glory hole 

690
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:30,110
with a some kind of weight on the other 
side proportionately.

691
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,003
Like what percentage of girls that lift 
weight go immediately to boody 

692
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:34,784
exercises?
Is it a hundred it's got any kind of 

693
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,084
squat rack or anything crazy yet.
That's where you're going to find the 

694
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,520
girls that really want to put on that 
booty mass.

695
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,640
Right?
It's like a high percentage.

696
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,940
Do you think the Dick strengthener would
make it shorter and fatter?

697
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,640
It would be dick strengthening gyms 
everywhere.

698
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,220
But what it turned you into a coke can?
No,

699
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,100
I think it would.
Uh,

700
00:33:59,101 --> 00:33:59,934
it would,
it would have to be like you could grow 

701
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:04,880
it out like you could eat.
He could actually create more tissue.

702
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,410
What is this?
What he's showing us?

703
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,640
I can't find the name of this movie.
I guys trying to hang like Asian weights

704
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,923
from his Dick.
They got like all these cattle bells 

705
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,710
hanging from his deck and the girl's 
like,

706
00:34:20,711 --> 00:34:24,270
I can't believe this.
Oh,

707
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,500
what is the name of this movie again?
I couldn't find the name of it.

708
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,900
It's gotta be a parody,
but she's got to keep them hard.

709
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,010
There's a black guy looking at him like,
what the fuck are you coming over there,

710
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,743
Dan?
That keeps stacking kettle bells on his 

711
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:43,220
dick.
But if there was something like that,

712
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,270
like something like a glute ham machine,
you know,

713
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:49,790
something that just targeted the deck,
you should talk to rogue.

714
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,480
I don't think it's going to work and 
you'd have one in here.

715
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,460
I probably would start playing with 
prototypes.

716
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,270
Fucking a lot of people are going to 
send you one.

717
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,730
If anybody's going to figure it out,
it's going to be Ben Greenfield.

718
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,940
It's probably going to be some fucking,
well,

719
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,721
you know,
I had them on,

720
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:07,310
on its podcast after,
uh,

721
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,430
after he was on yours the first time.
And I was like,

722
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,480
you know,
what do you want to talk about?

723
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:13,010
And we're in the Sonnet on it and I'm 
like,

724
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,900
I want to talk stem cells.
And he's like,

725
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:17,690
listen,
no more dick stem cell talk.

726
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,340
I was like,
why?

727
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,333
I was like,
you're fucking,

728
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,161
he goes,
no,

729
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,990
I don't want to be known as the Dick 
stem cell guy.

730
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,610
And I was like,
well yeah,

731
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,710
you went on the wrong show.
But uh,

732
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,550
you know,
I still,

733
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,470
we still talk stem cells and obviously,
you know,

734
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:32,810
we were chatting before the show.
It's fucking Rad.

735
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,730
It's very cool.
We got to talk about,

736
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,650
um,
the intravenous stem cells that he did.

737
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,270
Oh,
Jamie's

738
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,820
show me some more dudes tying weights to
the end of their dicks on youtube.

739
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,530
Oh God.
Jamie,

740
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:47,490
this is not good.
Oh come on.

741
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,383
Oh that's at the base of his cock.
And he was holding onto the shaft while 

742
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:51,264
he was

743
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,680
oh man.
And then he gets up and he,

744
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,860
he like gives blessings to everybody.
Blessings.

745
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:01,290
I carried the large walk with my cock.
Yes.

746
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,173
To learn it as part of that video.
You can have that when like fate or 

747
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,390
after it's over.
No expression on the face.

748
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,770
Just like,
yeah,

749
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:08,604
I know what I can do.
The weirdest way to pick up a rock with 

750
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:14,430
your Dick and then end it.
Once she gets up he's getting dirt to it

751
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:15,660
or something.
Well,

752
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,460
um,
is that writing,

753
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:18,680
is that Indian?
Uh,

754
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,910
is that Hindu?
Hindi,

755
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,730
Hindu.
Is the religion Hindu?

756
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:24,750
Is the writing?
Is that what it is?

757
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,243
Um,
look how they just allowed to show his 

758
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:31,650
cock and balls.
I think it's cause it's like,

759
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,480
cause its nature,
it's a feat of strength there.

760
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,830
Another video I did not pull up that was
direct,

761
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:37,664
like showing you how to do this kind of 
stuff with weights and Kudos to youtube 

762
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:42,554
for allowing us look at this.
He just grabbing the honker at the very 

763
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:46,004
end.
He's got the rope wrapped around the 

764
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:49,760
middle and homeboys just going to pick 
up this rock.

765
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,830
He's got to widen that squat stance.
Yeah,

766
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,263
I'll give this blessing.
Have the cock of death blessings he's 

767
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:57,064
got,
he's figured out a way to lift weights 

768
00:36:58,721 --> 00:36:59,554
with his Dick,
like he's actually doing it and he 

769
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:04,180
seemed to be a wreck there.
People seem to be there to see him.

770
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:07,300
Two children,
he's famous.

771
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,680
He's a famous Dick Week guy.
Do you think he has pupils?

772
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,513
Was He,
will he take on deciding what a great 

773
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,010
reality show that would be?
He has to,

774
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,510
he can't take that to the grave with 
them.

775
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,523
Yeah.
You have some dude who was born with a 

776
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:22,390
small penis and you send him to this 
guy,

777
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:27,310
to the master apprentice in India,
and he just starts going through all the

778
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,150
rituals,
the stones and the Deq and the sticks,

779
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:33,690
and there's gotta be more to it.
Oh,

780
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:34,770
look at these guys.
Oh,

781
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:39,480
I've seen this price using weights to 
enlarge your penis there swinging.

782
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,860
Oh Christ.
That looks like 10 pounds.

783
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,200
Don't say two five pound plates.
Is that Bolo Chong from bloodsport.

784
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,923
Oh,
that's a woman.

785
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,680
Oh Wow.
They're not moving their hips.

786
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,760
They're not at all using the Dick there.
They're using Dick Muscle.

787
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,283
That is so crazy.
So they have something tied to their 

788
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:04,254
Dick.
We can't see it because they have some 

789
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:07,290
sort of a skirt over it.
For people that are listening,

790
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,193
it literally looks like a skirt and then
the rope is making this weight swing 

791
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:14,420
like a pendulum in between their legs 
and they're,

792
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,353
they're not using their hips.
They're doing it all with their Dick 

793
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,623
Muscles.
Now they're practicing kicking in the 

794
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:20,994
balls.
Very important to let a guy kick you in 

795
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:24,930
the balls.
What?

796
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,380
This guys blow testicles all the time.
Right.

797
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:33,970
I know at least two or three guys that 
were kicked and blew out a testicle in a

798
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,860
fight or no,
mostly

799
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,720
I heard of it in training.
I mean,

800
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,520
I'm sure it's probably happened in 
fights too,

801
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,880
but uh,
definitely in training one of the,

802
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,743
one of the military guys,
like a real promising kid had it happen 

803
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:49,840
to them.
I'm trying to place his name.

804
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:53,000
Did it end his career?
I do not know God.

805
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,130
Um,
I really apologize for not remembers.

806
00:38:55,131 --> 00:39:00,131
Now I want to say Brian Foster to do it 
was his fault and you,

807
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,240
I've seen a long time,
but in training he got uh,

808
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,120
he got kicked,
kicked low.

809
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:10,620
Uh,
he didn't have a cup on.

810
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,730
It's like one more round one with that 
kind of deal.

811
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,080
Okay,
we'll spar one more round.

812
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:15,640
Fuck it.
And wham.

813
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,490
I never understood that when guys 
wouldn't work.

814
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:19,810
Cups and sparring.
So crazy.

815
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,570
Don't roll the dice there.
It's too risky.

816
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,150
Did you wear it everywhere?
It's tie steel cup.

817
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,340
Cain was big into that,
but I didn't like that it went up.

818
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:29,080
Your asshole.
You know,

819
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,670
it was like,
ah,

820
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,760
I don't know about that.
Plus they're smaller,

821
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,653
you know,
like they don't like the American ones 

822
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,370
come stairways to brag.
I'm just saying,

823
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,550
I'm just saying they were,
it looked like it looked like it'd be in

824
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:43,930
a tight spot.
That's all.

825
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:44,764
Yeah.
Well you can't make a cup for 140 pound 

826
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:52,531
Thai guy and then make that same cut fed
on gorillas like yourself.

827
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,380
Just need a bigger cup.
It's just part of just your gloves.

828
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:57,850
I liked it.
There was a little bit of space.

829
00:39:57,851 --> 00:39:59,200
That's all I'm saying.
Do you have,

830
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:00,034
um,
is it like that leather thick padding 

831
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,360
around the edges of it?
No.

832
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,690
So like when it goes into you,
it doesn't go into it straight.

833
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,630
It was like the rubber with a hard 
plastic,

834
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,640
like a baseball Kabaddi guys like those.

835
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,100
There was this dude Amea rent of Rd.
He was one of 'em Bas rutten's proteges.

836
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,383
And we used to train with them at 
Eddie's place and he'd mount you and he 

837
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:22,684
had that fucking steel cup and it would 
be like he was crushing your sternum 

838
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:30,460
with his Dick.
It was uber uncomfortable who's not fun.

839
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,210
He was very good at that.
He would get mount on you and just crush

840
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:38,860
you down like you like unnatural 
leverage in arm bars as well.

841
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,873
When you go over that Steel Cup,
like you got a metal thing that you're 

842
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:45,430
bending someone's arm against,
it's a big deal.

843
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,470
It's a really big deal.
If you think about it.

844
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,300
I mean you would think like,
wait a minute,

845
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,160
I go even a regular arm bar,
hold on.

846
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:54,940
You're pulling his arm into your balls 
like what the fuck?

847
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,260
Yeah,
you are.

848
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,123
You are your Dick and balls are resting 
on someone's arm when you give them an 

849
00:41:01,031 --> 00:41:02,860
arm bar that has just a fact.

850
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,993
If you don't like that fact,
your goal in fact is to get your Dick 

851
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:11,110
and balls to rest on this guy's arm,
but you're not thinking about that.

852
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:12,850
You're thinking of getting your hips 
down on him,

853
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,953
getting that arm in between your legs or
getting to a arm in between your arms 

854
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,390
and your legs,
extending your body.

855
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:23,740
But if you have any steel cop dare you 
got this crazy fulcrum.

856
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,680
You get this weird leverage point and 
it's made out of metal.

857
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,880
It's a fucking metal piece.
So instead of having vulnerable balls,

858
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,950
you have this thing,
you know,

859
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,960
you have like a lever,
you could snap shit better.

860
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,560
Mike Swift popped my rib out two days 
before a fight with his cup.

861
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,450
This one right here.
Damn.

862
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:42,650
It still fucked up.
Yeah.

863
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,660
Reset that way.
Wow.

864
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,880
It's from those Goddamn Steel Cups,
right?

865
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,231
Yeah.
Yeah.

866
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:49,190
I mean this wicked teen and just dug 
his,

867
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,670
his cup was writing under a rib and I 
was dead tired last,

868
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,600
last round of training of the entire 
fight camp and popped it out.

869
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,943
I wonder how controversial I'm so out of
the loop when it comes to grappling 

870
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,920
[inaudible] grappling competitions.
I wonder,

871
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,780
um,
how legal they are.

872
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,700
I wonder if they're allowed to use them 
at all.

873
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:08,360
I wish.
Uh,

874
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,330
I don't know.
I don't think they get to,

875
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,300
to use cups if any sort and it to sort.
Yeah.

876
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,370
Without the crazy.
I would want to wear a cup.

877
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,383
I've,
I've been smashed and then nuts before 

878
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:19,730
in training.
I don't want to get to,

879
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:22,190
I don't think it's a loud wow,
that's crazy.

880
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,083
Yeah.
No cups at all because of that fulcrum 

881
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:26,160
point probably.
Yeah.

882
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Yeah.
Must Be.

883
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,050
It's crazy that your dick would become 
an advantage,

884
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,303
like you know,
like that area instead of like being 

885
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:34,364
like one object changes what that is.
So it goes from being like a super 

886
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:40,400
vulnerable area to Ooh,
if I get you there,

887
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,320
you know,
even like north south,

888
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:45,440
like Cain and happy in north south and 
just fucking digging into the side of my

889
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:45,980
face.

890
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,380
Oh Jeez.
And I'm sure his ball sweat there too,

891
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,960
but I mean really that no,
they would fuck me up.

892
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,973
Yeah.
You got a metal bar driving in your 

893
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:54,104
face,
a real piece of metal and if you kicked 

894
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:58,790
those fucking things,
you pay for it.

895
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,940
Like if you kick those things and you 
slap it with your instep,

896
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,950
ah,
ah.

897
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,283
It's like you might as well be kicking a
rock or kicking the bottom of someone's 

898
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:08,714
elbow.
Worse than young Jamie and running down 

899
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,530
the mountain and his vibrams.
Yeah.

900
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,510
Young Jamie tried to go barefoot shoe 
running.

901
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,450
Which one did you go?
Did you get the vivo barefoot or get the

902
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,413
vivas?
Yeah,

903
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,610
super thin.
Super,

904
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:20,600
super thin.
Yeah.

905
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,910
Yeah,
I got checks.

906
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,873
I have two different pairs of those.
I got one that has like a lot of tread 

907
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,240
that's like a got a good thick amount of
tread and then another one that has less

908
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:32,203
and the the one that has less like you 
could feel the difference when you run 

909
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,840
like these real slippery steep slopes.

910
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,123
I need something where I can dig in if 
I'm trying to like sprint up to the top 

911
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:45,470
of the hill and I don't want to be 
worried about my footing.

912
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,630
I want to be able to,
I'm tired at that point too.

913
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:52,100
I'm going all the way up this fucking 
dude or they toe shoes or they have full

914
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:53,280
coverage,
full coverage.

915
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,040
So yeah,
I like that better for for running.

916
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,920
Yeah.
You know you stub your toe on Shit,

917
00:43:57,921 --> 00:44:00,320
you can't watch where your,
you have to like when I wear,

918
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:02,270
I liked the Vibram,
so where am all the time?

919
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,910
I don't have an endorsement with any of 
these people.

920
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,160
I don't have any kind of deals,
but the,

921
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:10,230
what I like about the vibrams is for 
sure it feels like you,

922
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:14,300
you're moving more with your pinkies,
like your pinky toes and the other toes.

923
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:15,050
They're,
they're like,

924
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,760
they were aware that they have a job.

925
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:17,893
Whereas I feel like when I wear it,
even barefoot shoes that have full 

926
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:22,760
coverage,
I feel like they're like,

927
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,040
they're lazy.
They're just along for the ride.

928
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,741
Yeah.
We'll just take,

929
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:26,680
we'll just take a break.
Yeah,

930
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:27,770
we'll take a break,
but was,

931
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:32,460
whereas I feel all that shit activated.
It might be just in my head,

932
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,480
but when I run with five finger shoes on
a trail run with those things on,

933
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:37,314
I feel like my foot is moving just a wee
bit more than even regular barefoot 

934
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,274
shoes.
Something about having all those little 

935
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:43,164
fuckers free like that and they feel 
their feeling and dirt the way they're 

936
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:46,830
supposed to.
Like they're,

937
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,693
they're,
they're moving together the same way 

938
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:49,404
your hands moved together when you grab 
all your fall and gravel or something 

939
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:52,440
like that,
your hand,

940
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,420
you know,
it moves together.

941
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:54,951
It's,
it's,

942
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:55,784
it's,
it's thinking of how to cushion blows 

943
00:44:57,871 --> 00:45:00,510
and how to stop something that's coming 
your way and how to,

944
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,880
how to interact with,
with space.

945
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,250
Where's your footage is kind of clubbing
the ground all the time.

946
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,653
I feel like with those shoes,
the one thing I'm aware of is that the 

947
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:10,104
foot is acting like as in it,
all the little individual muscles are 

948
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:14,490
helping to push me around.

949
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,930
You know,
it's massive.

950
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,853
I've noticed that on,
I mean I'll walk wearing them right now 

951
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:23,290
I'm at where I'm all the time right now.
No one's mother fucker walks around with

952
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:24,124
them.
Yeah.

953
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,740
Once I started walking him on a longterm
basis,

954
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,100
especially doing longer walks and jugs,
like there's a clear cut difference.

955
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,100
You have to be mindful of every fucking 
step you take.

956
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,530
Especially if they're thinner sold,
you know,

957
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,170
they make some fix old ones for,
for trail running and whatnot.

958
00:45:38,171 --> 00:45:39,220
But yeah,
I use those.

959
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,840
I use those.
I only,

960
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:43,420
the only time I use the really thin ones
are at the gym.

961
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,060
But yeah,
those are the ones I have.

962
00:45:46,061 --> 00:45:48,820
Jamie there,
uh,

963
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,170
you just got watch out for like sharp 
rocks.

964
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,150
Then I don't have to watch out for sharp
rocks.

965
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,530
And the other ones,
like if I'm running in,

966
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,770
something's kind of funky and it's,
I gotta go,

967
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,940
Ooh,
I don't want to land on that.

968
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,770
I gotta look,
you gotta pay attention.

969
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,360
Yeah.
But with those other ones,

970
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:06,080
I could just kind of hustle and breathe,
but maybe that's not as good.

971
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,540
Maybe it's better to do it that way.
You know,

972
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:10,374
maybe it engages your brain more forces 
you to think and make decisions while 

973
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:18,200
you were exhausted.
Actually,

974
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,980
it might be better now that I'm thinking
about it.

975
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:22,440
It might be a better thing to do as a 
workout.

976
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,190
You're more present to,
you know,

977
00:46:24,191 --> 00:46:26,310
you have to get about other bullshit.
It's kind of like,

978
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,163
you know when we're talking about our 
tree or the cold bath or any of these 

979
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:31,820
things it tells you in,
but to,

980
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,663
I think part of it for some people with 
running is like that getting into the 

981
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:36,480
zone thing

982
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,413
that you do,
you know when you start getting a pace 

983
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:39,394
going and just get into that zone when 
you don't want to think about any other 

984
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:45,363
extraneous shit.
And if you're doing that and watching 

985
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:49,570
every step you take,
is there,

986
00:46:49,571 --> 00:46:52,080
is it possible,
I'm just throwing this out there that'll

987
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:52,923
would like inhibit you from getting to 
the zone cause you'd have to be too 

988
00:46:55,151 --> 00:46:56,830
conscious about every step you're 
taking.

989
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:57,771
Maybe.
I mean,

990
00:46:57,771 --> 00:46:59,540
I'm sure everyone's different,
right?

991
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,130
But for me,
when I do that,

992
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,700
I don't feel,
I feel like it draws me into the zone.

993
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,713
Right?
Because if I can just run on a fucking 

994
00:47:06,681 --> 00:47:08,540
treadmill,
I'm not worried about where my feet go,

995
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,760
that kind of thing.
And then my mind will wander then.

996
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,773
Right.
Because I don't have to pay attention 

997
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:13,730
and it'll start thinking about other 
shit,

998
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:15,480
especially if it's an easy run.
Hmm.

999
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,740
My mind will wander then it's not dialed
in because it doesn't have to be.

1000
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,070
Yeah.
What kind of cardio machines do you use,

1001
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:25,340
if any?
Well one that I really like.

1002
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,473
I mean all I can use right now cause my 
niece fucked is the ski Erg and I that 

1003
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:29,980
Aubrey and I'll get

1004
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,860
on those and do some sprint work.
We're saying you have a,

1005
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,070
was it an MCL tear or torn meniscus?
Yeah.

1006
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,350
Yeah.
Thankfully no surgery required with that

1007
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,593
cause the placement.
But and so you got some stem cells on 

1008
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:42,131
that?
Yeah,

1009
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:42,964
we did stem cells.
What did they do last week we did a 

1010
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:50,581
umbilical stem cells intra-nasal a I v 
and in the knee with Gouda town.

1011
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,320
Jesus.
The new,

1012
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,920
the needed hurt.
Like I thought the fucking injection was

1013
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:58,930
going to hurt.
Like they are going to wiggle it in with

1014
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:01,360
some long ass needle,
but that wasn't bad.

1015
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:03,190
The pressure,
once it goes in,

1016
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,930
that fucking hurt,
um,

1017
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:05,764
stem cells fixed my left knee,
I was having problems with my left knee 

1018
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:09,304
for years.
I had a acl reconstruction on that knee 

1019
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,730
and on that knee.
Um,

1020
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,960
they took some meniscus out as well.
It's always been a problem.

1021
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:21,730
Like whenever I would work out real hard
look two or three days in a row,

1022
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:24,490
it was always sore.
Like I'd walk around and was just sore.

1023
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:25,563
It was B and then I have to warm it up 
to get going one session with a 

1024
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:30,844
umbilical cord stem cells and then I 
gave it a long time off and I never had 

1025
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:36,190
a problem with it again.
Like you literally went away.

1026
00:48:36,191 --> 00:48:38,020
It's like one of those things where I 
had a problem.

1027
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,110
Now I don't have a problem anymore.
Like he'll running,

1028
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,270
kicking the bag,
whatever I'm doing.

1029
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,910
Uh,
using that echo bike or the versaclimber

1030
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:47,890
anything I'm doing with my knees,
no problems.

1031
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,640
I'm just babying it now.
But we work with this guy Dr.

1032
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,320
Craig conover who did the stem cells.
He's been doing a vitamin IVS at a on it

1033
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,970
for us and he's a fucking savage.

1034
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,580
We'll do like the ntd treatments in Nad 
socks about.

1035
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:04,840
Greenfield was telling me really,
really it is official yet as fuck.

1036
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,630
Tell me about it.
It feels like we get it done at an ivy.

1037
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:11,160
What's the name stand for again?
I think it's nicotine [inaudible] at an,

1038
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:16,170
I had a dean at Dennis saying,
I don't know nicotine identity at Dennis

1039
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:18,700
seen die nucleotide.
There we go.

1040
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,650
Damn.
Anyways,

1041
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,940
it's a fucking,
it's,

1042
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:23,774
it's basically food for the Mitochondria
and you can influence that pathway 

1043
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:28,870
through fascinating hot and cold 
therapy,

1044
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,910
a high intensity intervals,
different things like that,

1045
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:33,700
but just to get it mainlined into your 
fucking body,

1046
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,803
it feels like someone's got their hand 
on your stomach and they're slowly 

1047
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:39,340
turning it.
It doesn't feel good.

1048
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,160
You fucking sweat.
If people have nasal issues,

1049
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:44,620
they'll sneak it.
Feel like it's turning your stomach.

1050
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:45,454
Well,
I think the idea is that because it 

1051
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:49,024
influences mitochondrial biogenesis,
it's going to kill off any old 

1052
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,163
mitochondria that needed to go,
but you want that in the gut and then 

1053
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:58,300
you get new ones and over time,
I mean,

1054
00:49:58,301 --> 00:50:02,540
we front load this a four to eight days 
in a row and by the end of this,

1055
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,170
I mean like front row front,
load it every single day.

1056
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,003
You do it for eight days.
Why then you only need it like once a 

1057
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:10,390
month or once every two weeks after 
that.

1058
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,690
Right.
Little touch ups after every single day.

1059
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,120
Every single day you're getting gut 
wrenched.

1060
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,470
Yeah.
But by the end of it,

1061
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,304
you feel better.
So because you've gotten rid of most of 

1062
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:21,370
the bad shit.
And again,

1063
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:22,360
that's theory.
It's not,

1064
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,770
I mean,
this is brand new stuff here.

1065
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,870
We've got to be pseudo sciences on rats.
Let me,

1066
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,420
let me say that this is the science 
side.

1067
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,560
Rats is always like a weird thing to 
say,

1068
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:33,230
but I'll tell you that the feeling,
the feeling is,

1069
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,330
is there's no fucking dot.
It works.

1070
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,283
I mean,
anything that influences mitochondria 

1071
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,530
influences everything.
That's energy for your brain.

1072
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:40,820
Cognitive function,
heart,

1073
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:41,683
lungs.
The whole nine Greenfield was saying 

1074
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:43,874
that he had the Mitochondria,
the like the telomere lengths and they 

1075
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,500
check his telomere length.

1076
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:52,250
That is biological age was 20 so he went
from,

1077
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,510
he went,
he started,

1078
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,590
yeah.
And listened to him.

1079
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,480
He had the Telo years guy on right.
And that's,

1080
00:50:56,481 --> 00:50:57,314
so I did the same test and his 
biological age was 36 and his 

1081
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:05,390
chronological age was 34 and I'm like 
this motherfucker who was homeschooled k

1082
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:06,224
through 12 and it's an Ironman 
triathlete is two years older 

1083
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,550
biologically than chronologically.
Where the fuck am I went to Asu?

1084
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,240
Did all the bad drugs get hit in the 
head fucking countless times.

1085
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,950
I gotta be,
it's gotta be bad.

1086
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:23,951
So at 35 when I did mine a biological 
age of 41 and I'm like fuck.

1087
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,830
So,
but right after he did the systemic stem

1088
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:32,831
cells through the ivy that dropped him 
from 36 to 20 years old biologically.

1089
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,150
And,
and how many did he do?

1090
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:36,200
How many sessions did he do?

1091
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,720
I don't know.
I think it was just after the first one.

1092
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,240
I know he's done a more and he did 
different stem cells.

1093
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,074
So why you,
why are you guys doing it so many days 

1094
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:45,410
in a row for the Ntd?
Yeah.

1095
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,180
Well,
the idea of front loading,

1096
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,610
you know,
they used to say that with creatine.

1097
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,110
I think that's been debunked,
but there are certain substances,

1098
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:51,944
especially with how they influence,
you can really ramp up and change the 

1099
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:57,860
body dramatically.
And then after that you just need little

1100
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:00,800
touch ups here and there.
But uh,

1101
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,540
you know,
I just feel like,

1102
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,970
what'd you feel like after with the ned?
I was,

1103
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,170
I was like,
I know,

1104
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,063
I want to know,
really be able to look at this like a 

1105
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,160
quantified self,
you know,

1106
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:11,900
I'm not going to be able to take numbers
and shit.

1107
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:15,680
So what I did was I put myself through 
the meat grinder.

1108
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,280
I hadn't really been trained in a lot 
and uh,

1109
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,153
since you know,
working my first real nine to five kind 

1110
00:52:21,231 --> 00:52:22,920
of thing.
And um,

1111
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:23,893
I train twice a day,
busted out the old altitude machine was 

1112
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:28,730
doing altitude every day,
hot and cold,

1113
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,170
you know,
he got the dual sauna on it.

1114
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,063
I do the cold bath at home and all 
during that process because we've got 

1115
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:35,900
the little,
the little guy,

1116
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:39,320
I wasn't sleeping well,
so put myself through all that.

1117
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,260
My fucking cardio went through the roof.
I never got sick.

1118
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:44,780
I recovered well.
So I knew it worked.

1119
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:46,100
And on top of that,
you know,

1120
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,750
cognitive function,
memory,

1121
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:48,584
retention,
everything was fucking scaling up a 

1122
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:52,610
notch and cardio.
Yeah.

1123
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,470
Fuck yeah.
Your cardio ramped up.

1124
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,650
Anything that influences mitochondria 
affects fucking all of it.

1125
00:52:57,651 --> 00:53:01,250
That's ATP throughout your entire body.
And it's brain too.

1126
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,360
You know,
people think of like,

1127
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,760
all right,
that's one of the,

1128
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,623
one of the reasons they're looking at 
Korea team right now as a nootropic 

1129
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:13,190
because he influences atp and the Bra,
every fucking thing in your body runs on

1130
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:14,930
ATP.
How have they done studies on this yet?

1131
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,210
Uh,
I think greenfield might be a better guy

1132
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:18,044
to ask,
but I'm,

1133
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:21,200
I'm pretty certain that they verified 
that creatine helps,

1134
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,170
helps the brain.
Now it makes sense if it helps muscles,

1135
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:25,221
I mean,
if,

1136
00:53:25,221 --> 00:53:26,340
if it helps blood

1137
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,800
flow,
I mean,

1138
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,353
I mean there's,
there's gotta be a bunch of different 

1139
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:33,840
things.
It's energy,

1140
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,900
it's seller cellular energy.
ATP is right.

1141
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:40,170
So everything runs on that one thing and
you're good there.

1142
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:42,780
Whether you're in Ketosis or you're 
eating carbohydrates,

1143
00:53:42,781 --> 00:53:46,620
it's all going back to ATP.
It's crazy.

1144
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,790
It's crazy.
You could do that.

1145
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:48,624
You could have someone inject something 
into you and all of a sudden you get 

1146
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:55,260
this like this recharge state.
And then there there's the debate.

1147
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,580
Okay,
is this healthy?

1148
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,060
Has it,
what's the long term?

1149
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,850
Well yeah I and then all this shit.
You know,

1150
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:01,650
it's funny because some of the 
drawbacks,

1151
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,530
I have a certain amount of followers 
online then you know,

1152
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:06,500
you go to a company like on it and you 
have,

1153
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:09,300
it's magnified right by a hundred by a 
thousand,

1154
00:54:09,301 --> 00:54:11,000
whatever.
And uh,

1155
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,180
you know,
anytime I post shit,

1156
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:15,210
cause I'll do stuff online for like the 
bio hack of the week at the life hack of

1157
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:15,570
the week.

1158
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,180
And sometimes it's just run of the mill,
you know,

1159
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,493
go for a fucking farmer's walk with some
weights in your hand or keep a 

1160
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:24,430
Kettlebell in your trunk and then you 
can always work out whatever.

1161
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,820
Or sometimes it's more technology based 
and we,

1162
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:30,840
we get a lot of shit on anything 
technology based.

1163
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:33,420
And of course the argument then is,
well,

1164
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,373
I,
I believe I can get everything I need 

1165
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:39,090
from a good diet and good nutrition and 
movement and I don't need to inject shit

1166
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:40,080
to be healthy.
And it's like,

1167
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:42,900
yeah,
but I like greenfields model,

1168
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:43,763
you know,
like you have one foot and then sister 

1169
00:54:44,671 --> 00:54:46,740
living in one foot in the benefits of 
modern science.

1170
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,780
Yeah.
So why wouldn't I fuck with that?

1171
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,640
I think that's a smart way to approach 
it.

1172
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:53,790
I think we have a real problem and we 
always have,

1173
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,920
uh,
as human beings being tribal,

1174
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,680
and I'm on tribe natural,
I'm all natural bro.

1175
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,490
You know,
don't take,

1176
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,470
I'm not into hormones.
I'm not,

1177
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:03,270
you know,
I don't need my cell phone man.

1178
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:04,104
I'd rather leave it alone.
And then we've got tribe science who 

1179
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:07,950
think that,
you know,

1180
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,370
that science is going to figure 
everything out and nature ain't shit.

1181
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:12,630
And just,
we're better than nature.

1182
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:13,523
We're smarter than nature as forward.
That's obviously the extremes of each 

1183
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:19,050
end,
but people just tend to fucking do that.

1184
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:20,880
Man,
there was the most ridiculous video that

1185
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:21,714
I retweeted from barstool.
I think it was barstool just find out 

1186
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:26,664
who I retweeted it from.
So we'd give him credit on their 

1187
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,320
instagram,
but they,

1188
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,540
it was a,
was it barstool?

1189
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:36,410
It was a video at a baseball game and 
one side was saying right fields sucks.

1190
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,740
And the other side was singing left 
field sucks.

1191
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,560
And they would yell it out on twitter.
Here we go.

1192
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:47,603
One,
two,

1193
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:48,683
three socks and everybody got pumped up 
and then the people over here like 

1194
00:55:53,611 --> 00:55:56,430
leftfield stuck.
People are so stupid.

1195
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:59,070
They will,
they will.

1196
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,460
The team,
that side on the left side is the burst.

1197
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,533
Like here it is.
Play this is it a Barstool barstool 

1198
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:07,494
sports.
Shout out to Barstool sports on 

1199
00:56:08,671 --> 00:56:09,504
instagram.

1200
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:14,740
Look at it.
[inaudible] we're not going to take,

1201
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,353
but

1202
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,500
say if I was there,
I would enjoy every second of that.

1203
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,890
Especially if I had a couple beers in a 
hot dog in me I had been yelling at too.

1204
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,173
Yeah,
man.

1205
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,550
I mean that's,
that's what's fun.

1206
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:43,384
Right?
And they're all rooting for the same 

1207
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,380
team.
Who knows?

1208
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,760
How do they do that?
Yeah,

1209
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,043
no,
but they don't fucking split the sides 

1210
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:52,360
on,
on a home.

1211
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,390
Does anybody ever again.
They do that and soccer,

1212
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,210
it might happen.
There might be a section,

1213
00:56:58,211 --> 00:57:00,220
but there's still people all over the 
place.

1214
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,960
But for both teams.
Yeah.

1215
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,360
Yeah.
So they're not rude on the same team,

1216
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,403
but like conceivably they could just go 
the hall that it proved my point even 

1217
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:10,930
further though,
because now you have both,

1218
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:12,940
you know,
say it's cubs and,

1219
00:57:12,941 --> 00:57:14,190
and a giant,
right.

1220
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,750
Cubs fans and giants fans sitting on the
right field,

1221
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:20,200
both yelling to the left field to left 
field sucks.

1222
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,960
Yeah.
And cubs and giants fans on left field,

1223
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:26,770
both yelling at to right field.
It's bringing people together.

1224
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:28,360
Joe Rogan to hate.
Yeah.

1225
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,640
For at least it's fake hate.
You know,

1226
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:31,980
they don't really think those people 
suck.

1227
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:32,814
I,
if you're out sat them down as 

1228
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:34,054
individuals and said,
what do you really think about these 

1229
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,850
random people on the right?
Like,

1230
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:38,260
Oh,
they're just folks that are sitting over

1231
00:57:38,261 --> 00:57:41,650
there watching the baseball game.
Is this a parallel for politics,

1232
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:42,940
for life,
my friend,

1233
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,490
for all of this life?
I don't know.

1234
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:46,324
Probably.
Right.

1235
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,193
It's probably something to that.
That might be also why trump could win 

1236
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:51,340
again.
He can,

1237
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:52,174
when he up,
anybody that believes that he won't win 

1238
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:55,630
again.
They're the same people that believed.

1239
00:57:55,631 --> 00:57:56,464
He stood no chance of winning.
The first time did I took a photo of 

1240
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:02,860
Jake Tapper on TV when the results were 
being read because he was,

1241
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:03,694
you know,
doing one of them report things and he 

1242
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:06,520
had the,
through the entire election,

1243
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:10,510
he was like really very,
very obviously,

1244
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,363
uh,
in an angst at the thought of this guy 

1245
00:58:13,301 --> 00:58:14,134
being president.
And then when he finally became 

1246
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:18,820
President Jake Tapper's face,
it's just like,

1247
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:20,740
it's so classic.
It's,

1248
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,130
it's one of those moments where you like
cheese Christ.

1249
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,893
I'm never going to forget that guys face
when trump was elected because it was 

1250
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:31,870
just like,
what the fuck is this?

1251
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,930
It was just a crazy face.
I mean,

1252
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:41,170
if everything works out,
nobody dies.

1253
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:43,510
No extra people die because of trump 
being president.

1254
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:47,650
This will be a very fascinating time to 
study,

1255
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:49,883
be a very fascinating time.
I don't think there's ever been a time 

1256
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:52,464
like this man,
drug laws are relaxing all over the 

1257
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:55,690
place.
They're,

1258
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:56,523
they're pushing MTMA through maps is to 
get it to use use for therapy for 

1259
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,330
soldiers with PTSD.
And it works remarkably well.

1260
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,164
It works better than fucking anything.
I've been able to guide a couple of 

1261
00:59:06,601 --> 00:59:08,670
those sessions.
Couple's therapy sessions,

1262
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:11,940
not the PTSD sessions have been like,
ah,

1263
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:14,100
fucking incredible.
I mean,

1264
00:59:14,101 --> 00:59:19,101
I watched a breakup happen with that and
I've never seen people break up prior to

1265
00:59:19,531 --> 00:59:20,730
that.
So I don't really have the,

1266
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,460
but just seeing

1267
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,620
it,
it's hard opening medicine,

1268
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:25,663
you know,
and I know that you haven't had great 

1269
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:27,644
experiences with it in the past,
but this pharmaceutical shit is a whole 

1270
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:32,030
different animal now.
Have a bad experience.

1271
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,980
I only had a bad experience with the 
com,

1272
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:34,873
the company.
There is no come down with the 

1273
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:37,214
pharmaceutical.
I mean fucking zero and I mean 

1274
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,260
diminishes your um,
your,

1275
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:43,550
your dope.
I spoke to,

1276
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:45,500
I've spoken to Rick Doblin about this 
twice.

1277
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:46,630
Serotonin levels.
Yeah.

1278
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,650
And the thing is,
you know,

1279
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,900
as with any is,
I know it's not a true psychedelic,

1280
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:53,570
but with any psychedelic,
what was the true psychedelic,

1281
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:54,503
true psychedelic like Marco Polo say 
would be like a trip to mean based 

1282
00:59:56,691 --> 00:59:58,580
psychedelic,
the classical psychedelics.

1283
00:59:58,581 --> 00:59:59,414
You look at,
um,

1284
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,220
hallucinations.
Yeah.

1285
01:00:01,221 --> 01:00:02,054
And you're,
you're thinking of things like 

1286
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,340
mushrooms,
Lsd,

1287
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:05,690
you know,
watch Chuma,

1288
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,760
pod,
Iowasca dmt.

1289
01:00:07,761 --> 01:00:09,380
Those kinds of things would be more 
traditional.

1290
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,401
You know what,
man,

1291
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:11,234
I would,
I would honestly say that I think in 

1292
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:17,510
high doses,
edible marijuana is a psychedelic.

1293
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

1294
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,610
There's no doubt.
No doubt.

1295
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:20,960
I really,
I mean,

1296
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,850
I've heard people argue against that.
I'm like,

1297
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,560
fuck man.
I don't know.

1298
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,110
I think in high doses when you're,
um,

1299
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:31,910
when you close your eyes and lie down,
like sit down on a couch on a high dose,

1300
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,130
you're really,
really flying.

1301
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,530
I've had visuals from fucking gorilla 
glue,

1302
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,300
just smoking,
gorilla glue.

1303
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,520
My wife and I both,
what do you mean gorilla glue?

1304
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,170
It's a strain.
Not Actual Glue.

1305
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,760
Yeah,
it was huffing [inaudible] with my wife.

1306
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,850
I was like,
where I met with anything.

1307
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:49,130
It's fucking podcast took a turn.
I was like,

1308
01:00:49,131 --> 01:00:50,070
no,
Kingsbury.

1309
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,100
So savage,
he's out there smoking glue,

1310
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,560
gorilla glue.
It's the name.

1311
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:55,910
Yeah,
I'm not going to be a good father.

1312
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,630
And you experienced it.
Streets it fucking full blown,

1313
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,493
full blown.
You know you can get a man if you get 

1314
01:01:02,421 --> 01:01:03,254
high enough.
Mckenna used to say to the way to do it 

1315
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:05,474
was to not get high for long periods of 
time and then smoke as much as you can 

1316
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:11,330
handle in one setting.
That's not my jam.

1317
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,373
I've been using a one one milligram thc 
spray and I microdose cannabis fairly 

1318
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,380
often just in just in the evening and it
helps with sleep.

1319
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,030
Uh,
but this Mtma man,

1320
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:24,740
it's a whole fucking different ball 
game.

1321
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:25,574
I think it's interesting.
I think you should try if I can request 

1322
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,113
at some point you tried the 
pharmaceutical grade Mtma just to know 

1323
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:34,280
what it's all about because Rick Doblin 
was saying you give it,

1324
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:37,280
you give it space like you would with a 
classical hallucinogen.

1325
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,353
You're not supposed to fucking go back 
to work the next day or do a bunch of 

1326
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:43,640
bullshit,
tedious drawn back into the real world.

1327
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,250
Give it space journal,
meditate,

1328
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:48,320
throw on some easy listening,
music and rest.

1329
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:49,183
And if you do that you're fine.
Because in their protocol they're not 

1330
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:55,370
allowed to use anything else but the 
MTMA.

1331
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:56,263
So I asked him like,
why don't you guys have a protocol for 

1332
01:01:57,951 --> 01:02:00,020
five htp,
vitamin C,

1333
01:02:00,021 --> 01:02:00,854
different things we know help build back
the neurotransmitter support you may 

1334
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:06,920
have lost.
And he said just with the finagling with

1335
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:08,510
the FDA and everything they have to go 
through,

1336
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:09,344
he says it's fucking impossible.
But if we give him that day off their 

1337
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:13,034
gold and then of course new mood plug on
it again was designed for that 

1338
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:20,010
experience to be to curtail

1339
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,173
any kind of come down.
I've had zero issues after using the 

1340
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:25,740
pharmaceutical grade.
What was the original name of it?

1341
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:27,990
Roll on roll off or what was it like 
that?

1342
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:29,010
Yeah,
it was something like that.

1343
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,850
Yeah.
He was five htp boosters,

1344
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:36,810
like I mean five htp supplementation has
been going on from a long time.

1345
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,500
Lot of people have been into that.
It's hard.

1346
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,683
Yeah.
It's a smart way to approach Mtma till 

1347
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:44,280
like to stock up to have a bunch of your
system so your,

1348
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:45,114
your body is going to have to build this
shit up again because you're going to 

1349
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,304
flood it with it for awhile so you're 
going to have this weird little period 

1350
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:53,360
where your body is going to struggle.
But it's a,

1351
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,273
it's a thing that I would hope if this,
these studies do continue to prove 

1352
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:00,203
without a doubt that it's beneficial to 
a lot of these people that they make it 

1353
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:04,290
available to more people.

1354
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,250
It will be,
it will be,

1355
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:06,084
should be quick.
They estimate 2022 I think or 2023 at 

1356
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:09,744
the latest [inaudible] he got a f the 
FDA made a breakthrough drug I think 

1357
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:15,174
breakthrough drug,
which is like on the fast track to go 

1358
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:17,784
through.
I think the whole world would be way 

1359
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:23,400
better if everybody was on just like a 
micro dose of ecstasy all the time.

1360
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,470
Just a little,
just a little like Ah,

1361
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,533
I don't know that that could last but 
that would be medicine cause it's micro 

1362
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:30,541
dose.
That's the thing.

1363
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:31,374
You talk about compassion and all these 
other important lessons that have been 

1364
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:37,140
talked about in all spiritual texts,
it's automatic.

1365
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,630
You drop right into that.
Yeah.

1366
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:43,740
Do you think that it's possible to train
your brain to produce more of it?

1367
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:44,723
Do you think through meditation and 
mindfulness and all these different 

1368
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:52,020
practices that people do to stay 
present,

1369
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:53,820
to be more open,
more loving,

1370
01:03:53,821 --> 01:03:55,260
that you could build that up?

1371
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,093
Almost like a muscle?
I don't know that you could build 

1372
01:03:58,770 --> 01:03:59,603
serotonin up over time.
I'm sure there's some type of cap where 

1373
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,290
nature nature does not want us to be 
happy.

1374
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:05,124
24,
seven.

1375
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:06,930
Is there any tricks though?
But yeah,

1376
01:04:06,931 --> 01:04:09,270
to like getting it to turn on,
there's a book,

1377
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:10,123
uh,
the science of mindfulness by doctor 

1378
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:11,724
Ronald Siegel.
It's on one of the great courses on 

1379
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:13,854
audible and he's a harvard professor and
he talks about the brain like a fucking 

1380
01:04:16,951 --> 01:04:19,950
muscle and sciences back this,
the more you train that,

1381
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,160
the easier it is to drop into.
And I've had coaches,

1382
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:24,900
um,
breathwork coaches,

1383
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:26,790
you know,
we're working with the art of breath.

1384
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,273
Uh,
Rob Wilson and Brian Mackenzie came out 

1385
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:30,084
and they did like a full fucking blown.
They have breath working on it and the 

1386
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:34,464
more often you can shift into 
parasympathetic state from fight or 

1387
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:37,800
flight sympathetic,
you know,

1388
01:04:37,801 --> 01:04:38,634
you shift consciously through breath 
into that simple parasympathetic state 

1389
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,290
that becomes trainable.

1390
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,123
You can do that over and over again and 
then all it takes is just a couple of 

1391
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:47,970
deep breaths in your back,
right?

1392
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:50,160
Because you train that the fucking body 
remembers,

1393
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:54,480
the brain remembers and when you're in 
those states that shifts everything from

1394
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,670
the neurochemical response to the 
brainwave state.

1395
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,460
You can drop from Beta into Alpha into 
theta.

1396
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,340
That's fascinating stuff,
man.

1397
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:04,043
It's crazy to think what we understand 
about the various pathways these 

1398
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:12,300
chemicals have to go through and then 
what is like still confusing?

1399
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:14,310
Like here's the big one,
where's the,

1400
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,440
where's the consciousness coming from?
Exactly.

1401
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,190
How does it all become the thing

1402
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,023
that's looking through Kyle Kingsbury's 
eyes and seeing me in mind looking at 

1403
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:25,750
you w w what's exactly what's,
what is that thing?

1404
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,990
What is that thing that seems to be like
almost like a,

1405
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,040
like an energy that runs through this 
machine.

1406
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:36,760
It's through fucking everything.
It's in all things,

1407
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:37,863
but if we thought about it that way,
like you'd be so much more concerned 

1408
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:44,020
with keeping that energy high,
you know?

1409
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,130
I mean,
how much of what,

1410
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:47,580
what people experience when it comes to 
the,

1411
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:50,950
the word depression,
how much of it is their life going?

1412
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:54,430
Bad tragedy,
poor health,

1413
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:56,463
bad job choices.
How much of it is some sort of a weird 

1414
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:01,600
genetic thing?
How much,

1415
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:05,020
I mean there's so many variables as to 
what causes depression,

1416
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:09,460
but such a giant number of people suffer
from depression.

1417
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:10,300
Well,
I think it's,

1418
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,000
I think it only,
if I'm being honest,

1419
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:14,200
I think it's going to get worse.

1420
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,050
You know,
like you look at the way we live and the

1421
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:17,943
closer and closer you've spoken about 
that we were just talking about fucking 

1422
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:21,640
New York.
We're not meant to be that confined.

1423
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,320
We're not meant to sit out like with 
were withheld from the fucking sun right

1424
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:28,420
now.
So many of these things communicate with

1425
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:31,000
our bodies and working with a genetic 
specialist ran for singer,

1426
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:31,834
he was on Chris Ryan show sunlight 
influences 500 on off switches on our 

1427
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:40,420
epigenetic level for the,
for the good,

1428
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,040
unless you fucking overdo it,
right?

1429
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:47,430
500 500 plus on off switches in our DNA 
are affected by sunlight positively,

1430
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:49,683
right?
I mean there's,

1431
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:52,210
they look at vitamin D three takes that 
for example,

1432
01:06:52,211 --> 01:06:55,560
they're calling that a hormone now,
not a fucking vitamin real is,

1433
01:06:55,561 --> 01:06:56,394
it's a messenger.
That's how much it influences in the 

1434
01:06:57,941 --> 01:06:59,770
body.
Incredibly important.

1435
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,010
So when you think about all these things
like being barefoot,

1436
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,560
being connected to the earth,
going in the fucking ocean,

1437
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:10,720
science will catch up in certain ways,
but we get fixated on the thing.

1438
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,120
We get fixed and it fixated on our 
phones,

1439
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,930
on whatever TV is going on.
We're closed off from other people.

1440
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:17,681
We think,
you know,

1441
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:21,370
communicating through facebook is the 
same as being fucking face to face.

1442
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,730
It's not,
you know,

1443
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:25,420
and the more we head that direction and 
we're putting,

1444
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,501
you know,
as you put it,

1445
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:27,334
put in fucking shit food.
In our body from mouth pleasure that 

1446
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:31,270
influences the brain,
right?

1447
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,133
80 to 90% of all of our 
neurotransmitters are made by the 

1448
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:34,894
bacteria in our gut.
So you think the shit meals just going 

1449
01:07:36,961 --> 01:07:38,440
to put on five pounds.
It's not.

1450
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:40,810
It might put on five pounds,
but it's going to fuck your brain up for

1451
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:43,120
a while.
You make you a little bit more emotional

1452
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,260
fuck with your,
your,

1453
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,420
your sharpness,
your memory recall,

1454
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,940
all that's impacted.
Sleeps impacted.

1455
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,103
I wish Michael Walker talked a bit more 
about that and it's don't think it's in 

1456
01:07:52,421 --> 01:07:53,920
his wheelhouse.
I don't think it is.

1457
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:55,600
He's a,
he's just to go studies,

1458
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:56,434
sleep and the effects on it.
But fuck was that in illuminating 

1459
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,400
eyeopening podcasts was so important to 
me.

1460
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,700
It was fucking fantastic.
I think his book is really good,

1461
01:08:06,701 --> 01:08:07,534
but as far as like dialing in sleep,
it's more of this is what happens when 

1462
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:13,480
you don't sleep.
Sleep,

1463
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,410
the book,
sleep by Nick.

1464
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:16,070
Little Hales is probably my favorite 
because

1465
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,903
that gives you all,
it's a fucking how to guide on how to 

1466
01:08:18,771 --> 01:08:22,520
maximize sleep.
And when you were younger,

1467
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,220
lack of sleep didn't affect you the way 
it affects you now,

1468
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:26,300
right?
Correct.

1469
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,030
Yeah.
Everything he talks about like the,

1470
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,864
would that shift that you have that 
happens in adolescence where you become 

1471
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:32,780
a night owl?
No doubt.

1472
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,913
And I probably still could stay out a 
little bit later until having a kid and 

1473
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:38,600
then that's your,
your immediate reset bitch.

1474
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:41,630
You're getting up when the sun comes up.
Yeah.

1475
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,830
Be prepared,
sir.

1476
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,740
Get ready.
Yeah.

1477
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:46,603
It's um,
there's so many different factors that 

1478
01:08:48,711 --> 01:08:49,544
lead to a healthy body,
but how much of a healthy body leads to 

1479
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:53,264
a happy mind?
That's where it gets like you can't 

1480
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:58,760
blame some of these people that are 
suffering from like a disease.

1481
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,580
Some of these people that have like 
something wrong with the way their brain

1482
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:03,740
is producing these happy hormones.

1483
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:06,470
I don't think you can say it's just this
one thing like,

1484
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:09,560
well if you just eat clean or if you 
just went keto or Paleo,

1485
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:11,660
then you wouldn't have depression.
I don't think that's it at all.

1486
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:12,494
But certainly that's a factor.
It's certainly could be a fact being in 

1487
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:17,204
nature,
being in nature as a fact and unpacking 

1488
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:20,774
trauma.
Gaba Montay says at the heart of all 

1489
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,310
fucking addiction is some form of 
trauma.

1490
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:26,840
Yeah,
I'm sure.

1491
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:28,760
Completely makes sense.
Yeah.

1492
01:09:28,761 --> 01:09:29,210
His,
uh,

1493
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:30,970
his theories on that are fascinating.
It's,

1494
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,143
I never thought about that way.
That's some form of trauma during your 

1495
01:09:34,281 --> 01:09:37,760
developmental stage is led you to like 
seek out this weird,

1496
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:41,030
crazy feeling and experience.
When you,

1497
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:41,900
uh,
have,

1498
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,960
have you known many people that have had
like serious addictions,

1499
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:47,780
like meth or oh,
yeah,

1500
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,860
yeah.
Uh,

1501
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,040
without naming names,
uh,

1502
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,570
people very close to me.

1503
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,970
Family members.
Uh,

1504
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,570
I've been addicted to meth.
I lost a cousin to pills.

1505
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,620
Um,
I've been going to Aa,

1506
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:04,783
not for me,
for a family member since I was three 

1507
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:09,290
years old.
So I've seen that,

1508
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,900
you know,
what if is now,

1509
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:12,763
now is that trauma based is like 
everything because pills don't pills 

1510
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:19,190
just get kind of get everybody.
Yeah.

1511
01:10:19,191 --> 01:10:21,860
Pills can get everybody.
There's no doubt about that.

1512
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:23,150
Um,
there wasn't,

1513
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:24,283
there wasn't yourself off.
There was this show with some trauma 

1514
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:27,860
there on a,
in all of those circumstances.

1515
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:28,611
And I'm not saying,
you know,

1516
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:30,740
pills can fucking grab you,
there's no doubt.

1517
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:34,810
Um,
but certainly with the meth and uh,

1518
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,590
the alcohol,
which was other things,

1519
01:10:36,591 --> 01:10:38,570
you know,
no doubt there was trauma there.

1520
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:42,050
You have known of quite a few people 
that got fucked up on,

1521
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:45,110
on pills after operations or injuries or
stuff like that.

1522
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:45,943
But um,
I know quite a few of them that it 

1523
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,020
kicked it,
you know,

1524
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:48,883
[inaudible] just realized it was 
happening when whoa down like a 

1525
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,170
[inaudible] talked about it quite a bit.
When he fought cro cop,

1526
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:55,004
his nose was destroyed so they had to 
rebuild his nose and he started taking 

1527
01:10:57,891 --> 01:10:58,724
pain pills and he said after a while,
he's just taking them every day just 

1528
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:02,084
because we wanted to take him.
And then his friends came over and 

1529
01:11:04,131 --> 01:11:05,620
cleaned out.
It's a medicine cabinet and like,

1530
01:11:05,621 --> 01:11:08,420
cut the shit dude,
you're is four months later you're still

1531
01:11:08,421 --> 01:11:10,760
taking these things all day long,
you can't do that anymore.

1532
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:11,870
And he's like,
whoa.

1533
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:14,490
He said he almost didn't even realize he
was doing it.

1534
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:16,320
It just kinda caught a hold of him.
Yeah.

1535
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:18,810
Shit becomes habit.
Especially when it's that euphoric.

1536
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:21,960
Must be amazing.
You know what I took the other day?

1537
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:23,970
I took a large dose of Kratom.

1538
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,380
Ooh,
yeah.

1539
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:30,240
Everybody always tells you that Kratom 
is a one thing at a small dose,

1540
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,333
you know,
it's kind of a two pills to me seems a 

1541
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:38,160
almost like a stimulant.
Like 100% yeah,

1542
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:38,994
and even up to four pills,
but you're getting the land to eight 

1543
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:44,340
pills.
I took eight pills the other day.

1544
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:45,450
I was like,
Whoa,

1545
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,610
this I am.
Hi Mike.

1546
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:48,444
I'm fully functional.
I'm not worried about the way my body 

1547
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:51,474
moves.
Like it's not like I'm going to fall 

1548
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:54,390
down when I'm walking.
Everything seems like it's working good,

1549
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:58,620
but I'm clearly high,
but I'm not hiring a bad way.

1550
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,530
Like I can talk fine.
I can remember things,

1551
01:12:01,531 --> 01:12:03,780
full conversations,
happy,

1552
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:06,390
remember people's names,
but I'm definitely high.

1553
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:08,250
Yeah.
Kratom is a funny one.

1554
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,380
You know it's,
it's still an opiate.

1555
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,690
It's still hitting those receptors.
It's actually an opiate.

1556
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:13,800
Yeah,
I believe it is.

1557
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,023
Um,
but what did they Hamilton Morris from 

1558
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:18,980
Hamilton's Pharmacopia coming on soon.
Yeah,

1559
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:19,860
he's,
you know,

1560
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,380
that's one of the things he says because
he's not spiritual.

1561
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:23,214
He,
even though he does all these 

1562
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:24,600
psychedelics,
um,

1563
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:26,603
so he gets really pissed off and people 
call it plant medicine or to the agenda 

1564
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,451
and shit like that.
He's like,

1565
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:32,400
you have to fucking say you call it what
it is.

1566
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:33,700
Right.
I'm sure he did it.

1567
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:35,940
There's a lot of that fuckery though,
right?

1568
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:36,640
Yeah,
it is.

1569
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,710
But,
but at the same time,

1570
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:38,544
I mean,
you can so real and a lot of times you 

1571
01:12:39,721 --> 01:12:40,554
can take mushrooms recreationally or you
can do the rogue dose and it be happy 

1572
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:46,800
guided and you can do,
I was in the Amazon and it's a whole,

1573
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,550
it's a fucking world different.
Yeah,

1574
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,160
for sure.
Totally different experience.

1575
01:12:50,161 --> 01:12:51,750
But yeah,
going back to Kratom,

1576
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:55,710
thankfully I've always had this thing 
with opiates where if I had too much,

1577
01:12:55,711 --> 01:12:59,880
I get nauseated really bad,
so I can take one or two pills and it is

1578
01:12:59,881 --> 01:13:00,714
a mild stimulant.

1579
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:01,643
I drove to greenfields house when I was 
living in Vegas to podcasts with him 

1580
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:08,580
thousand miles each direction and I just
have one pill every three hours.

1581
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,080
Wow.
And it was awesome.

1582
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,330
I was fucking,
I felt great.

1583
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,440
So if I can heal every three hours,
just kept you focus while he driving.

1584
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,333
And I felt there's about euphoria.
I felt good being in that little ass 

1585
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:19,980
Prius the whole way,
you know,

1586
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,240
which is important.
Right.

1587
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:22,103
Let me see.
I don't even know how you climb in that 

1588
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:24,530
day.
I got that.

1589
01:13:24,531 --> 01:13:28,470
I got in there,
but let's just take three or more.

1590
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:29,573
I'm fucked up.
Like I'm riding that fence and gonna 

1591
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,610
Puke.
Am I going to Puke?

1592
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,340
So interesting.
So even for you,

1593
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,950
they have the same reaction that like an
oxy would have.

1594
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,270
Yup.
And I've had,

1595
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,553
I mean,
in college I did some weird shit at 

1596
01:13:41,441 --> 01:13:44,310
keystone and oxy once and uh,
wow.

1597
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:48,780
Fucking under the folks not learned in 
the ways of the dirty dogs.

1598
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,270
He put it up,
his asshole to Nicholas deep,

1599
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,343
not super up as the people that people 
are like what case stirred dudes would 

1600
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:59,450
just go,
oh well yeah,

1601
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,670
last time,
last time I was on your show,

1602
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:02,370
they're like,
oh,

1603
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:03,203
you lost me when you told me the trees 
started talking to you when I was 

1604
01:14:05,011 --> 01:14:08,280
describing night and ios experience.
That'll be the one this time.

1605
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,133
Do you lost me when you told him when 
you stuck about putting a pillow for 

1606
01:14:10,551 --> 01:14:14,440
your ass?
That's when they turned out the podcast.

1607
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,000
Um,
but yeah,

1608
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:17,830
I felt fucking great that one time I 
tried it.

1609
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,810
I tried to,
I snorted one later,

1610
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:20,993
you know,
like a few weeks later and I was fucked 

1611
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:23,554
up.
I was fucking puking the whole time and 

1612
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,160
uh,
and you could suck off the,

1613
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,230
I don't want to,
it went bad drugs.

1614
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:30,760
I want to tell people how to do good 
drugs.

1615
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:31,803
Why would you a snort it?
Cause it goes right into your 

1616
01:14:33,161 --> 01:14:34,210
bloodstream.
Yeah.

1617
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,100
You know,
you can suck at that time.

1618
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:37,000
Release,
crush it up,

1619
01:14:37,001 --> 01:14:38,350
let it dry.
Wow.

1620
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:40,060
So,
but that ultimately that was like,

1621
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:40,510
well,
yeah,

1622
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:41,343
there's still,
thankfully I still have this fucking 

1623
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,073
regulator on my body that says don't put
these fucking super addictive manmade 

1624
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:49,180
chemicals in your body.
That's fascinating.

1625
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:52,900
Do you think it's create a manmade,
it was sort of a plant,

1626
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:53,740
right?
It is plant based.

1627
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:54,574
I mean all this shit's plant based.
The issue is when we take something and 

1628
01:14:56,691 --> 01:14:57,524
we fucking concentrate it and change it 
in a way to where it just really has an 

1629
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:02,374
affinity for receptors and we lose out 
on all these other alkaloids and 

1630
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:08,950
turpines and things like look at marinol
versus whole plant cannabis.

1631
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:09,843
Oh,
right.

1632
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:12,670
Fucking bulk.
If they take this stuff and then turn it

1633
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:16,210
into an actual drug that they sell,
they're only going to sell parts of it,

1634
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:16,730
right?
Yeah.

1635
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:17,563
Yeah.
They're selling the active ingredient 

1636
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:19,203
like cocaine versus fucking coca leaf.
Totally different experience and it was 

1637
01:15:22,711 --> 01:15:25,120
ever had coca tea.
They have had coca tea.

1638
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:26,650
I've,
I've thrown coca leaf.

1639
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:27,484
This is called,
they call it Mommy and Columbia and you 

1640
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:29,500
chew it.
Chew.

1641
01:15:29,501 --> 01:15:31,000
Yeah.
How is it an amazing,

1642
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:34,000
it's like a cup of coffee though.
Like less jittery,

1643
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,190
your brain turns on.
It's a nootropic.

1644
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:39,130
You feel like 1 million bucks.
We can't catch it

1645
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:43,750
because in Miami [inaudible] they fucked
us all their,

1646
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,820
their whole city's made out of coke.
No,

1647
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:48,490
that,
no,

1648
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:49,950
no dude.
You,

1649
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:51,840
have you ever seen cocaine cowboys?
Yes,

1650
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,500
dude,
that's all Miami.

1651
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:54,850
That,
that all that,

1652
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:58,030
that area of Florida,
they're one point at one point in time,

1653
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:01,480
I don't know if it's still the case,
but Miami had more banks per capita than

1654
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:04,780
any place else in the country because 
everybody is just laundry and Koch money

1655
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,793
and coke is just coming in like crazy.
There's so many great documentaries on 

1656
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:09,041
it.
It's a really,

1657
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:12,820
really fascinating time in like history,
like during cocaine.

1658
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:14,620
Cowboys wants,
shout out to Billy Corbin,

1659
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:19,210
the um,
the first one they talked about how many

1660
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,613
of these uh,
police officer's wound up dead or in 

1661
01:16:23,261 --> 01:16:24,094
jail and it was like an entire class 
graduating class either was dead or in 

1662
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:32,190
jail for corruption.
But,

1663
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,300
but it's something,
you know,

1664
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:36,850
they had made this a look at this time 
period,

1665
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,530
however many years it was a of this 
cocaine trafficking.

1666
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,553
Who's crazy man,
like it's a incredible time and like 

1667
01:16:46,721 --> 01:16:49,270
human history,
Ben,

1668
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,793
this article,
it says that it's ramped back up to 

1669
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:57,070
those 1980s drug war heights of 
production.

1670
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:58,330
Whoa.

1671
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:59,320
Hey,
so how's it getting in?

1672
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,220
That's the question.
Yeah.

1673
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,700
How are they getting it in?
I don't think that's a problem.

1674
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:04,683
I don't think it is either.
But how are they doing it and how do 

1675
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:07,451
they,
I mean,

1676
01:17:07,451 --> 01:17:11,150
that's a lot of money.
Why are you so much of that money?

1677
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:14,630
So much money in it that what it costs 
us.

1678
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:18,980
Florida customs and border protection 
confiscated 4,200

1679
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:23,240
pounds of cocaine last year compared to 
1,730

1680
01:17:23,241 --> 01:17:27,770
pounds the year prior to that.
So it means the guy,

1681
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,950
the guy that was getting paid off the 
year before it got caught,

1682
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,310
maybe.
How else are they getting it in?

1683
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,383
I don't.
Maybe they just caught more coke the 

1684
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,963
time.
Maybe they're getting coked up and then 

1685
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:42,110
they're taking the boats.
They just take risks.

1686
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,213
I know where these fucking cops hide.
I know them better than they know 

1687
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:46,604
themselves.
We've never seen cocaine production at 

1688
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:50,930
these numbers.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1689
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,270
Stay the fuck out of Miami for a while 
folks.

1690
01:17:53,271 --> 01:17:55,850
It could get crazy or go there or go 
there.

1691
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:56,990
Yep.
I liked the way you think,

1692
01:17:56,991 --> 01:17:58,190
dude,
into the fray.

1693
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,950
You know,
where's the party?

1694
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,813
Miami,
the DEA estimates Columbia produce 710 

1695
01:18:05,451 --> 01:18:10,451
tons of pure cocaine last year or enough
to fill about 18 semi trucks.

1696
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,850
Ah,
did you see that a so crazy.

1697
01:18:18,851 --> 01:18:20,990
They found the first coca farm in 
Mexico.

1698
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,570
Oh Jesus.
That can be a problem.

1699
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,423
Yeah.
Well it actually might help with the 

1700
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:29,120
drug wars really.
If they can grow it and they can't fight

1701
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,410
against each other,
they can't grow it.

1702
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:31,244
Yeah.
Mexicans in Columbia has been fighting 

1703
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:32,834
for a long,
so they would start fighting with each 

1704
01:18:34,071 --> 01:18:34,904
other and that would help the drug war.
They would fight less because Mexico 

1705
01:18:37,191 --> 01:18:41,930
would have its own production.
But I mean they said it was growing in a

1706
01:18:41,931 --> 01:18:44,990
place that wasn't the same altitude and 
obviously cocaine,

1707
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:49,880
it's an alkaloid that is really it.
It grows at altitude,

1708
01:18:49,881 --> 01:18:53,750
so you want that,
that environmental stimulus for that.

1709
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:54,584
You know,
you want the hormetic stressor in order 

1710
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:58,190
for it to produce more cocaine,
pound for pound,

1711
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,930
and I think it would produce far less 
that.

1712
01:18:59,931 --> 01:19:01,730
That's at least what they were saying in
the article,

1713
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:02,960
which makes sense to me.

1714
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:05,683
Why?
What's the justification for what does 

1715
01:19:07,471 --> 01:19:10,010
this Jamie,
we show how they're getting it in.

1716
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:13,980
I says speedboats chuck mills and on 
poor old lady.

1717
01:19:13,981 --> 01:19:15,960
Look at this poor old lady.
She's holding the kilos.

1718
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,970
She looks like she's about seven years 
old,

1719
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:20,460
maybe older,
maybe eight years old.

1720
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:23,240
And she's fully strapped up with 
cocaine.

1721
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:24,630
I mean,
who could,

1722
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,240
who could blame this lady?
Do you think she's out there hustling?

1723
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,740
She got a pistol in people's faces.
You're the shine that that's fucked up.

1724
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:33,443
That's fucked up.
So we need more good drugs and less bad 

1725
01:19:37,051 --> 01:19:40,080
drugs.
We definitely need more good drugs.

1726
01:19:40,081 --> 01:19:40,914
We need to do something to get this does
wave of negativity that so many people 

1727
01:19:48,691 --> 01:19:49,524
are experiencing on a regular basis.
Do you settle that down and bring that 

1728
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:54,330
up?
Do you know anybody that's done ketamine

1729
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,650
treatment?
Yes.

1730
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,080
And pretty good results,
right?

1731
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:01,710
Neil Brennan had very good results.
He liked it quite a bit.

1732
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,060
He,
um,

1733
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,670
he's done a bunch of different things 
for depression,

1734
01:20:05,671 --> 01:20:07,920
magnetic things,
ketamine things.

1735
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:08,040
He

1736
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,940
said Ketamine was very effective.
Yeah.

1737
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,580
I had a,
one of my first coaches,

1738
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,460
a striking coach,
he had,

1739
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,333
you know,
he'd been put on every kind of fucking 

1740
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:17,903
Ssri for years and just felt like shit.
And he did for Ketamine treatments and 

1741
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:27,540
he's down to like one Ssri off 90% of 
his medication.

1742
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:29,790
He said he's never felt better.
I like that,

1743
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:30,624
that shitty voice that everyone has in 
their head that was so loud for him is 

1744
01:20:33,631 --> 01:20:35,490
nonexistent now.
Whoa.

1745
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,900
Yeah.
We got to do that.

1746
01:20:36,901 --> 01:20:37,734
Dr.
Craig put us through a slightly 

1747
01:20:39,181 --> 01:20:40,980
different,
most of the people that I think that are

1748
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:41,814
doing ketamine treatment do at Ivy.
We had an intramuscular injection of 

1749
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:46,830
ketamine.
That's the John Lilly.

1750
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:50,430
It was fucking insane,
like 40 minutes long.

1751
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:54,240
Um,
and it was kind of tied in with the stem

1752
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:58,920
cells really to just be in a state of 
allowing and whatever subconscious level

1753
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:00,960
of accepting this foreign substance into
your body.

1754
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,790
Let's,
let's kind of move the needle on that.

1755
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:03,840
Again,
that's theory.

1756
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,940
Um,
what's the experience like?

1757
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:07,570
What it's a psychedelic,
correct?

1758
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:08,730
It is,
but it's different.

1759
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:10,170
So again,
we talked about the,

1760
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:11,004
the classical types tryptamine base 
going to fit in serotonin receptors in 

1761
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:15,670
different parts of the brain.
Um,

1762
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:19,770
this is a dissociative,
so it pulls you back layers,

1763
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:20,604
you know,
like we talked about Eckhart toll last 

1764
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:22,890
time,
how he talks,

1765
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:25,230
be the observer,
be the witness of your thoughts.

1766
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:28,020
You're not your thoughts.
Just pull yourself back a layer and kind

1767
01:21:28,021 --> 01:21:31,440
of see your mind chatter as this 
interesting thing like kids arguing,

1768
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:33,540
right?
This will force that.

1769
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:36,390
And it pulls you back layers beyond 
that.

1770
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,510
Like to the point where,
you know,

1771
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:42,240
you're not in your body,
but when you reenter your body,

1772
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:45,840
there's a lot of gratitude and you can 
kind of see things where they are,

1773
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,291
you know,
you,

1774
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:47,940
you understand now like,
oh,

1775
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,433
this is how I was feeling before,
but I've been removed from it long 

1776
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:54,600
enough to when I come back to it,
I can recognize it for what it is.

1777
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:57,510
Whoa.
And I don't have depression now,

1778
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,810
you know.
So doing it was,

1779
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:01,800
it was just more of a,
let's see what happens,

1780
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:02,663
you know,
kind of kind of intention as opposed to 

1781
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:07,140
like people that are going in there 
working on shit might be a bit different

1782
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:09,150
for them,
but it was fucking bananas.

1783
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,540
Yeah.
I've never talked to,

1784
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:12,653
um,
I knew a guy who got addicted to it 

1785
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:14,220
though,
as a,

1786
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,200
as a street drug,
as a party drug.

1787
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:18,070
You know,
some people have snorted half's in order

1788
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:18,904
to,
yeah.

1789
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,280
What does it do?
It's,

1790
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,480
it's,
you know,

1791
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:22,620
it's,
it's Kinda like lsd.

1792
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:23,454
You have a microdose Lsd,
completely different experience than a 

1793
01:22:25,651 --> 01:22:29,730
full hid or two to five to whatever,
all different experiences,

1794
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,283
you know.
If you take like a key bomp a key bump 

1795
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:33,654
for people with a lack of the 
terminology would just be like the end 

1796
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:40,670
of a keys worth a bag.
You just curl,

1797
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,840
snort,
and um,

1798
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,660
it's very relaxing.
You want to move.

1799
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:46,494
But you know,
if you push the envelope a little bit 

1800
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:51,630
because it's disuse disassociated,
it's very disorienting.

1801
01:22:51,631 --> 01:22:52,464
Like you can like,
I don't know where the fuck I am or 

1802
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:55,350
what's going on.
Some,

1803
01:22:55,351 --> 01:22:57,700
if you go really far,
it's,

1804
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,553
it's similar to injecting it where you 
go in the k hole and you're kind of 

1805
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:03,360
paralyzed and close your eyes.
You're in a different spot.

1806
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:05,590
Oh,
you're in a spot.

1807
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:06,340
But the psychedelic

1808
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,780
trip from that,
you were in a different spot.

1809
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:09,850
Like you're in a different place.
Like psychedelic.

1810
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:10,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

1811
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:11,740
Like you could be,
I mean,

1812
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:13,600
for,
for 30 to 45 minutes,

1813
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:15,280
you could be in a vision,
you know,

1814
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:19,150
you could be elsewhere.
Your consciousness is not in your body.

1815
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,450
That's the key.
Yeah.

1816
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:24,280
That's the key hole.
Yeah.

1817
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:25,383
Um,
the guy who invented the sensory 

1818
01:23:26,471 --> 01:23:27,304
deprivation tank used to do it 
intramuscularly and then climate of the 

1819
01:23:29,621 --> 01:23:30,550
tank.
Yeah.

1820
01:23:30,551 --> 01:23:33,850
I heard that he had a,
at one point by the end,

1821
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:34,684
he was so hooked on it that he would run
an ivy so he could stay on 24 hours in 

1822
01:23:38,021 --> 01:23:39,040
there.
But you know,

1823
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:40,840
I was telling you about that book that 
he wrote,

1824
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:42,400
the center of the cyclone.
Yeah.

1825
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:44,680
That was a fucking fascinating book 
because he would,

1826
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:47,200
he would get as a medical doctor,
300,

1827
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:48,880
uh,
he'd get any pupils,

1828
01:23:48,881 --> 01:23:53,320
a 300 Iq from Sandoz pharmaceuticals of 
pharmaceutical grade lsd.

1829
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:57,520
Do that intravenous,
then get in the float tank for 10 hours.

1830
01:23:57,730 --> 01:23:59,920
And the trip reports he has,
when you read these,

1831
01:23:59,921 --> 01:24:04,150
they're very IOWASCA s like talking to 
other beings and other consciousness,

1832
01:24:04,151 --> 01:24:07,090
dmt like experience,
but 10 hours,

1833
01:24:07,091 --> 01:24:11,060
not fucking 15 minutes.
And just fascinating like he's,

1834
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:11,913
and as a doctor,
so with detailed in his ex explanation 

1835
01:24:15,101 --> 01:24:17,020
of what he's seeing,
what it means to him.

1836
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:18,603
Pretty fucking cool.
If that's an experience that once you 

1837
01:24:22,631 --> 01:24:25,690
know that you can have,
I don't know that if I,

1838
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:26,583
I,
I would have a real hard time fitting 

1839
01:24:29,891 --> 01:24:34,810
into regular life if I knew that I could
just have that 10 hours,

1840
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:39,840
like the DMT flash of 15 minutes of the 
weirdest interactions with whatever they

1841
01:24:40,961 --> 01:24:42,520
are,
whatever those things are.

1842
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:46,990
When you come back,
imagine that for 10 hours it might,

1843
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,160
you know,
invite like just change everything about

1844
01:24:51,161 --> 01:24:52,120
your perceptions of life.

1845
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:56,020
You might just give up on civilization 
and move to the forest or something.

1846
01:24:56,021 --> 01:24:56,854
You might,
and that's exactly what happened to the 

1847
01:24:57,881 --> 01:25:00,100
unabomber.
The unabomber was a part of the,

1848
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:02,050
uh,
the Harvard lsd studies.

1849
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,513
They'd juice that guy to the tits dam 
and then afterwards he went to be a 

1850
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:09,334
professor at Berkeley so he could save 
up enough money so he could buy a 

1851
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:13,624
fucking house in the woods and blow up 
the people that are creating technology 

1852
01:25:16,331 --> 01:25:19,090
because the technology is what's going 
to supplant human beings.

1853
01:25:19,091 --> 01:25:19,924
It's gonna gonna take over.
You serve our position on earth or some 

1854
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:24,820
crazy shit.
And he just decided he was going to kill

1855
01:25:24,821 --> 01:25:27,790
all these fucking scientists and be 
remembered that and he was like,

1856
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:28,773
yeah,
but that's,

1857
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:29,943
that's an odd take.
I had a different take on technology in 

1858
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:36,430
a Iowasca ceremony where I saw pretty 
much what's happening now.

1859
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:39,520
It was like this beautiful merging.
It wasn't man left behind.

1860
01:25:39,521 --> 01:25:40,354
It wasn't super intelligence with Nick 
Bostrom where we have to worry about 

1861
01:25:42,521 --> 01:25:43,354
this thing's taking over,
like we fucking stayed neck and neck 

1862
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:49,000
with it and integrate with it throughout
and we do change.

1863
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:51,190
We're not the fucking same,
but we're not the same now.

1864
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,570
That's the one of the things they talked
about,

1865
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:56,620
like who's the first Cyborg eyeglasses?
You weren't fucking eyeglasses.

1866
01:25:56,621 --> 01:25:57,454
You're a fucking Cyborg.
That's manmade technology integrated 

1867
01:25:59,831 --> 01:26:02,110
into your being.
That changes your perception of reality.

1868
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:03,040
Sure.
Right,

1869
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:05,270
so we're already doing that with our 
fucking phones.

1870
01:26:05,271 --> 01:26:06,500
We're already,
we're already there.

1871
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:08,060
No,
if he cars,

1872
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,433
yeah.
You had this weird idea that it has to 

1873
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:12,650
be implanted into you in order for that 
to be the case.

1874
01:26:12,651 --> 01:26:14,420
We're already fucking there.
Yeah,

1875
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:18,860
we're there both with the connection 
with this thing.

1876
01:26:18,861 --> 01:26:19,880
It's always in our pocket.

1877
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,713
And then with transportation and the 
transportation hooks up to the 

1878
01:26:23,091 --> 01:26:25,610
connection so you can listen to things,
you know,

1879
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:25,971
like,
I mean,

1880
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:27,080
how many times you,
you're in your car,

1881
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:28,670
listen to a book on tape through 
Bluetooth,

1882
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,800
you know our or podcasts that you 
download.

1883
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,330
That's everything.
Aubrey.

1884
01:26:32,331 --> 01:26:36,920
Aubrey ties a chapter in his book on the
day on that mindfulness or mindfulness.

1885
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:37,993
So when you're driving like what's the 
worst part of fucking most people's 

1886
01:26:40,011 --> 01:26:41,240
days,
the commute,

1887
01:26:41,241 --> 01:26:41,870
right?
Yeah.

1888
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:45,290
So you can choose to be pissed off guy.
You can listen to talk radio,

1889
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:46,124
you can do all these things.
Or you can practice mindfulness 

1890
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:50,150
meditation where you're resetting 
yourself.

1891
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:53,150
You're giving yourself some quiet time.
Obviously eyes are open while your hands

1892
01:26:53,151 --> 01:26:53,984
are on the wheel,
or you do mindfulness where you fucking 

1893
01:26:55,851 --> 01:26:56,684
throw on a dope podcast or a book from 
audible and you would take information 

1894
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:03,470
in that's going to help you fucking grow
as a person,

1895
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:04,363
right?

1896
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,730
It can be into entertaining.
I enjoy fictional books.

1897
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,880
I like some fiction on,
on audio books,

1898
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:13,380
which is its function.
You know what,

1899
01:27:13,381 --> 01:27:15,050
I,
I love Stephen King books,

1900
01:27:15,051 --> 01:27:15,884
but I do not like it when he reads them.
You need the high royer a fucking 

1901
01:27:19,191 --> 01:27:20,660
professional.
God dammit.

1902
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,390
I like,
I like the author,

1903
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:24,523
the author of these delays.
I'm reading the tipping point from a 

1904
01:27:27,021 --> 01:27:27,854
Mountain Malcolm Gladwell and I'm 
hearing him do the audio part is great 

1905
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:34,213
because he's very passionate about the 
subject matter and he's the guy that 

1906
01:27:36,711 --> 01:27:41,450
wrote it and so him re reading out these
results in all these different facts and

1907
01:27:41,451 --> 01:27:44,500
really fascinating things about the 
tipping point and you know,

1908
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:47,870
certain trends.
Is it Stephen King is like,

1909
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:50,360
he's a brilliant,
brilliant writer.

1910
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:52,160
Like one of my favorite writers for 
sure.

1911
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:54,800
My favorite horror writer.
I loved a shit.

1912
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:55,663
Like I used to read him when I was 
taking the train to go to taekwondo 

1913
01:27:58,641 --> 01:27:59,060
practice.

1914
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:01,090
I would read Stephen King books all day 
long.

1915
01:28:01,091 --> 01:28:01,924
That's all I would read.
So I was always a giant fan is but as a 

1916
01:28:06,141 --> 01:28:09,140
professional actor,
perhaps doing more spirited job,

1917
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:12,960
I've had some fucking bad actors on 
audible.

1918
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,920
Yeah.
That gets a bad ones like radio host,

1919
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:16,783
you know,
like in the next chapter we're going to 

1920
01:28:18,231 --> 01:28:22,850
tell you why it advanced glycation end 
products are the devil and you're like,

1921
01:28:22,851 --> 01:28:24,800
fuck off dude.
Like it's just,

1922
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,120
it,
it ruins it for me.

1923
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:28,100
Well,
especially when telling a story,

1924
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:29,023
this is my thing.
You need someone who has a very good 

1925
01:28:33,621 --> 01:28:38,090
sense of theater.
Like the way they communicate the words,

1926
01:28:38,091 --> 01:28:39,350
the way they say,
the words,

1927
01:28:39,351 --> 01:28:41,870
the emphasis they put on each individual
word.

1928
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:44,210
Especially with fiction.
That's really important.

1929
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:45,283
It's odd to me though that like audible 
doesn't coach them on that because 

1930
01:28:47,331 --> 01:28:48,890
everybody was saying when he did the 
book,

1931
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,970
he was a King on fucking stop coaching.
Like if debris.

1932
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:53,833
Yeah,
if he was reading something they'd be 

1933
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:55,280
like,
ah,

1934
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,480
excuse me,
Mr Marcus.

1935
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:57,373
Um,
we're going to have you go ahead and 

1936
01:28:58,281 --> 01:29:00,110
reread.
Starting at the top of the page.

1937
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,040
It sounds like you're,
uh,

1938
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:02,100
your mind's in a different

1939
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,440
place.
Like they would catch everything,

1940
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:08,700
every influx know he's got to read far 
ahead.

1941
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:10,110
You've got to know where you're going 
with it,

1942
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:11,130
all that shit.
And he said it was,

1943
01:29:11,131 --> 01:29:11,964
I mean,
maybe they've changed over time with 

1944
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:14,760
their approach to that,
but,

1945
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:15,721
well,
I think,

1946
01:29:15,721 --> 01:29:16,554
you know,
it's probably completely different for 

1947
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:19,104
different subject matter.
Aubrey's book is obviously a self help 

1948
01:29:20,971 --> 01:29:23,660
book own the day.
Uh,

1949
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:28,110
but other books that are stories about 
like monsters or some shit like that,

1950
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:30,810
like what's required of the,
the,

1951
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:33,450
the guy reading in has to have a sense 
of theater.

1952
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:36,000
He's telling a story has got to be 
there.

1953
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,790
The pause is,
have to be like a professional,

1954
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:40,390
like a professional voice actor.
Those are,

1955
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,880
but that's what you want for those 
things.

1956
01:29:41,881 --> 01:29:42,900
Yeah,
they're better at it.

1957
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:45,030
They just,
Stephen King's a wizard at writing.

1958
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,170
I mean,
he's fucking phenomenal,

1959
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:49,110
but I don't want to hear him doing 
different voices and shit.

1960
01:29:49,111 --> 01:29:50,160
Like it's just too weird.

1961
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:54,053
You know,
he's got a great book though and it's 

1962
01:29:54,901 --> 01:29:55,980
great.
Not just,

1963
01:29:55,981 --> 01:29:57,010
uh,
uh,

1964
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,440
for writers,
but for everybody.

1965
01:29:58,441 --> 01:29:59,274
It's Stephen King on writing.
It's really interesting because it's 

1966
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:03,024
sort of a,
there's a lot of his sort of life and 

1967
01:30:04,951 --> 01:30:05,784
work philosophy and in the book.
And I feel like when I read about 

1968
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,390
someone who is,
in my opinion,

1969
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:18,410
one of the greatest contributors to like
fun books and fun horror movies.

1970
01:30:19,261 --> 01:30:23,340
I mean he's the all time king to me.
And so to be able to say like,

1971
01:30:23,341 --> 01:30:24,100
well,
what,

1972
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,970
what was going on in that guy's head as 
he was writing Carrie?

1973
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:30,090
Like how did he,
how did he conceive of Christine?

1974
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,890
Like what's his,
what's his process?

1975
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:35,280
What's his process for writing?
It's really interesting,

1976
01:30:35,281 --> 01:30:35,881
man.
First of all,

1977
01:30:35,881 --> 01:30:37,380
he doesn't even know what the fuck he's 
gonna write.

1978
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,710
Like when he starts something,
like he doesn't know where he's going.

1979
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,030
He just,
he just does it.

1980
01:30:42,031 --> 01:30:44,490
And as he's doing it,
he figures out where it's gonna go.

1981
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:45,683
Like that's part of the genius of his 
method is that it's not like this sort 

1982
01:30:49,381 --> 01:30:51,000
of like,
um,

1983
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:51,893
it doesn't have a fucking outlaws.
He's going to get bit by the snake and 

1984
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:55,530
then Bob's going to turn into a horse 
and then,

1985
01:30:55,531 --> 01:30:57,030
you know,
all this stuff's going to happen.

1986
01:30:57,031 --> 01:30:59,370
And then his wife's kind of fall in love
with that horse.

1987
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:01,320
And then he's going to be mad when it 
becomes a person again.

1988
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:02,850
He just goes with it.
You know?

1989
01:31:02,851 --> 01:31:03,684
He just,
he just,

1990
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:04,890
he and he,
you know,

1991
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:05,724
he just shows up every day and just puts
in the time and focuses on it and then 

1992
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:14,970
makes it happen to what a crazy way to 
make a living,

1993
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:19,890
to just invent stories and weird things 
that happen and just put it all together

1994
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,810
in your head and then give it to people 
like,

1995
01:31:21,811 --> 01:31:22,740
look what I've done.

1996
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:24,630
I came up with a story and then you 
open,

1997
01:31:24,631 --> 01:31:25,500
but look,
fuck.

1998
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:27,540
Where's the story going?
This story crazy.

1999
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:32,810
It's a really interesting way to,
to make a living because he's using like

2000
01:31:33,031 --> 01:31:33,864
he's flexing one very specific part of 
his brain that most people don't really 

2001
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:38,724
use at all or hardly ever used.
Most of us don't have any type of 

2002
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:45,890
creativity left.
It's sucked out through school work.

2003
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:46,823
Yeah.
We're fucking taught to just go sit and 

2004
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:52,320
be a cog in the machine unless you're 
super fortunate and have a job where you

2005
01:31:52,321 --> 01:31:53,280
can create.
Yeah,

2006
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:54,173
yeah,
yeah,

2007
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:56,840
yeah.
Man.

2008
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,110
Got a tickle.
That piece though.

2009
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,980
I met this Guy Decker,
who is one

2010
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:00,813
of fucking opera's greatest mentors out 
in Sedona and he's a fictional writer 

2011
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:07,240
for the most part,
but just fucking,

2012
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:10,840
he's a wizard and a,
I was doing a water fast,

2013
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,840
so I had a wife five day water fast.
Ellen just water,

2014
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,270
just water for five days.
How long did you make it?

2015
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:17,790
Four and a half.
Damn,

2016
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:19,990
he's throwing up a half a day early.
Well,

2017
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,460
the thing,
so close to home,

2018
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:24,830
the thing was a science shows four days,
right?

2019
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:27,850
Four days is the magic mark.
So the extra day was just like,

2020
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:29,200
all right,
I've got an extra day to go.

2021
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:30,423
But,
um,

2022
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:34,570
we hiked cathedral rock in Sedona and 
it's fucking epic.

2023
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:36,760
And there's,
there is an energy there like New York,

2024
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:38,080
but different.
But what is,

2025
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:39,430
what's going on?
What's the donor?

2026
01:32:39,431 --> 01:32:41,310
Why is it don't all this,
is this a donor?

2027
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:42,220
Well,
from,

2028
01:32:42,221 --> 01:32:43,054
from what I understand why,
why it's the hippies traveler's guide 

2029
01:32:45,911 --> 01:32:48,520
and everybody wants to be there is,
um,

2030
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,670
are you familiar with pulsed 
electromagnetic frequency?

2031
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,313
Uh,
I've heard that those words for 

2032
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:55,324
everybody of everyone that's about to 
jump on the fucking Wu bandwagon and 

2033
01:32:59,171 --> 01:33:01,690
shit on me right now.
Punching the Google bar.

2034
01:33:01,691 --> 01:33:05,530
Do me a solid punching the Google bar.
NASA study on Pemf.

2035
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:06,783
Okay.
Three this year fucking study verified 

2036
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:11,620
with the earth has its own energy field,
right?

2037
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:14,140
Whether you want to call it,
what do you think the earth is alive and

2038
01:33:14,141 --> 01:33:15,670
it's guy and all that.
I'll leave that up to you,

2039
01:33:15,671 --> 01:33:18,840
but it has its own fucking energy field.
And so there's,

2040
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:21,340
it's not the same.
It's not equal throughout the earth.

2041
01:33:21,341 --> 01:33:24,250
There are places where that's 
accentuated and you feel that more.

2042
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:25,990
You feel it more when you're in the 
ocean.

2043
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:26,853
There's negative ions there.
A Wallace j Nichols wrote physiological 

2044
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:30,784
and molecular genetic effects of time,
varying electromagnetic fields on human 

2045
01:33:34,361 --> 01:33:36,280
neuro,
no nero,

2046
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:37,870
Nero,
nero,

2047
01:33:37,871 --> 01:33:38,980
no cells.

2048
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:41,230
I've never seen that word before.
I've seen neuro,

2049
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:42,340
neuro,
no,

2050
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:43,760
I don't know sauce.
Nora.

2051
01:33:43,761 --> 01:33:45,110
No,
I like the way they simple.

2052
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,130
Why is it,
is it bitch?

2053
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:48,850
Just because it's all in caps and it 
looks so weird to me.

2054
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:50,740
You know,
occasionally a word just looks weird.

2055
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:52,030
That looks weird,
that word,

2056
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:56,260
neuronal and ronal there's a good book 
pmf.

2057
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:57,400
I forget the author,
but,

2058
01:33:57,401 --> 01:33:58,234
um,
they don't even know that you're going 

2059
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:01,180
to have to do with that.
I think it has to do with that.

2060
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:04,780
This is interesting.
Do feel that that energy there,

2061
01:34:04,781 --> 01:34:07,120
it's palpable and it's not fucking make 
believe.

2062
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:10,120
So knowing that we'd be in this special 
place,

2063
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:11,613
knowing that I'd be with some really 
interesting people and that if I was to 

2064
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:20,320
take some medicine at that point in time
after fasting for four days,

2065
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:22,150
what Hamilton Morris and we'll call 
drugs.

2066
01:34:22,151 --> 01:34:23,440
Yes.
What do you call drugs?

2067
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,610
So I had 200 micrograms.
The LSD.

2068
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:28,563
Okay.
And I won't mention anybody else that 

2069
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:30,604
had it with me just because they maybe 
don't sign off on that kind of shit 

2070
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:33,790
publicly.
But,

2071
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:34,624
um,
we hiked to the top of the cathedral 

2072
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:38,440
rock and it's fucking incredible.
I mean,

2073
01:34:38,441 --> 01:34:39,350
incredible.
And uh,

2074
01:34:39,351 --> 01:34:42,250
another buddy of mine who's a,
who's a teacher at Black Swan Yoga,

2075
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:46,900
he brought up some really good cacau 
from the chocolate,

2076
01:34:46,901 --> 01:34:50,200
but pure fucking get cal from Guatemala.
He made it into these drinks.

2077
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:52,900
And um,
that's what I broke the fast with.

2078
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:54,940
Oh Wow.
There's chemicals in that,

2079
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:55,581
you know,
like it's,

2080
01:34:55,581 --> 01:34:57,650
it's funny what people fucking qualify 
as drugs.

2081
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,340
Cause

2082
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:01,460
like terence and Dennis Mckenna say like
we are walking bags of chemicals.

2083
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:04,340
This caffeine than a drinker right now 
as a fucking drug.

2084
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,450
Yeah.
100%.

2085
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:06,284
100% theobromine in Krakow is a drug.
It's an alkaloid in cow that will 

2086
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:15,170
elevate heart rate.
It's a mild diuretic and it,

2087
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:20,040
it fucking opens the heart.
It's like Ma microdose of Mtma really?

2088
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:21,483
How stacking that,
why do you think people fucking love 

2089
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:25,580
chocolate?
It's amazing.

2090
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:28,880
Theobromine social shit would have like 
the tiniest amount of it.

2091
01:35:28,881 --> 01:35:30,890
Is that what chocolate you're eating 
right?

2092
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:32,223
Some dark chocolate,
really bitter dark chocolate that's 

2093
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:35,840
going to have higher amounts,
you know.

2094
01:35:35,841 --> 01:35:39,050
But we had a fuck ton of this.
Like you're supposed to have four ounces

2095
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,870
is like a good dose,
four ounces of liquid.

2096
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:45,710
This liquid with,
with their special special uh,

2097
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:48,830
preparation method and I special blend 
my friend special blend.

2098
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:51,620
What is the,
I'm like,

2099
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:53,450
what is is like a shake?

2100
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:55,270
Like was there other stuff in it?
There's,

2101
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:55,851
there's,
yeah,

2102
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:57,800
there's some Cayenne,
there's lemon juice.

2103
01:35:57,801 --> 01:35:59,150
There's different things to help 
activate it.

2104
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:00,023
It's done the way the Mayans did.
It's been passed down generation after 

2105
01:36:01,941 --> 01:36:05,240
generation and it's like microdosing 
Mtma yeah.

2106
01:36:05,241 --> 01:36:09,050
And so stack that with the LSD and it's 
kind of like a candy flip.

2107
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,033
Now.
Couldn't people just go by CACAU and 

2108
01:36:11,931 --> 01:36:14,120
microdosed Mtma well,
you're,

2109
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:15,620
you've got to order it offline and do 
the,

2110
01:36:15,621 --> 01:36:17,900
do the online and do the preparation 
properly.

2111
01:36:17,901 --> 01:36:19,010
But I mean,
there's no doubt.

2112
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:20,450
You feel different.
It's a warming.

2113
01:36:20,451 --> 01:36:22,850
You feel more loving.
You're sensitive to touch.

2114
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:23,691
But this is,
I mean,

2115
01:36:23,691 --> 01:36:27,170
this is not in any way illegal,
illegal,

2116
01:36:27,171 --> 01:36:28,790
but I was taught how is food.
Yeah.

2117
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:30,080
I've been talking to a guy who was like,
look,

2118
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:32,030
if they fucking just discovered,
could count a day,

2119
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,370
they would say,
potentially this is,

2120
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,233
this is drug.

2121
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:37,970
I've never heard this before.
This is the bromine.

2122
01:36:37,971 --> 01:36:39,590
Fucking look it up.
There's a ton of shit.

2123
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:41,120
Uh,
this guy that,

2124
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:41,963
that's on a self hacked.com.
I forget his name but he's a wizard and 

2125
01:36:44,691 --> 01:36:46,970
he has like amazing articles on 
different chemicals.

2126
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:48,523
He talks about 13 scientifically backed 
studies on theobromine that are all 

2127
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:53,120
human studies.
It's dope shit.

2128
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:53,951
So anyways,
we stayed,

2129
01:36:53,951 --> 01:36:56,600
we take this and uh,
we climbed the mountain,

2130
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:57,973
we're in nature,
we're doing fucking Wim Hoff breathing 

2131
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:00,440
and different shit up there.
We look,

2132
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:03,230
we look the part we were sticking out 
like sore thumbs.

2133
01:37:03,231 --> 01:37:04,064
They fucking 230 pound guy with his 
shirt off doing why snorting coke cow 

2134
01:37:07,671 --> 01:37:11,030
could be the next party drug.
Next big party drug.

2135
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:14,150
Oh my God.
And that's on maxim.com.

2136
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:16,100
So we,
we take Jesus Christ.

2137
01:37:16,101 --> 01:37:19,820
This is crazy.
We take our substances were up there and

2138
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:20,683
you know this guy,
he's got like 12 books that are number 

2139
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,254
one bestsellers.

2140
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:26,590
Guys get us started.
He's,

2141
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:27,561
Oh,
is that,

2142
01:37:27,561 --> 01:37:29,750
he's joking around.
He's joking around as fuck.

2143
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:32,750
He's not starting co those are key 
bumps.

2144
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:34,670
Key bumps.
What are you saying?

2145
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:36,470
He's gonna snort that.
Yup.

2146
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,300
He is going to snort that.
Here we go.

2147
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:40,400
Let me see what you got.
Sun fucking pound it.

2148
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:44,720
You use pounded out a boy.
I actually,

2149
01:37:44,721 --> 01:37:47,660
I have snorted theobromine recently as 
the office Guinea pig.

2150
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:50,540
That's not the way I would recommend 
administering it.

2151
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:53,630
What's wrong with the going up the nose?
Uncomfortable.

2152
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:56,010
It's not that bad.
No,

2153
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,023
I'm not.
That's not a blanket recommendation for 

2154
01:37:58,051 --> 01:38:01,530
people though.
But this is not a dangerous substance.

2155
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,550
No,
no.

2156
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:04,150
I mean too much of it.
You know,

2157
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,550
there's a fucking upper limit to 
anything,

2158
01:38:05,551 --> 01:38:07,620
even water.
But you know on the mountain,

2159
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:10,080
going back to this on the mountain,
so with Ted Dekker,

2160
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:11,520
Ted Dekker,
hi Ted.

2161
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:14,610
Ted's the fucking man and he's written 
all these books and he's like,

2162
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:18,030
would you like me to tell a story and 
imagine you're sitting with Stephen King

2163
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:20,760
on Lsd on the mountain top.
And he says,

2164
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:25,440
would you like me to tell you a story?
That level of fucking writer and he goes

2165
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:29,100
into one of his books and I was fucking 
sold,

2166
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,590
like just drawn right in.
I could see everything,

2167
01:38:31,591 --> 01:38:32,424
fucking alien worlds,
all this shit that she's got a battle 

2168
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,020
and you really see like just the mind,
like how creative the mind can be.

2169
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:41,790
It blew me the fuck away.
Of course,

2170
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:43,800
the substance has helped me draw me into
it,

2171
01:38:43,801 --> 01:38:46,260
but man,
he's a special guy.

2172
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,000
Well,
there's,

2173
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,690
there's quite a few special people out 
there,

2174
01:38:48,691 --> 01:38:51,300
which is why we're so lucky we can go to
the movies.

2175
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:53,790
You know what I mean?
I mean,

2176
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:59,220
think of how much fucking creativity,
how much thought and imagining scenarios

2177
01:38:59,221 --> 01:39:00,930
and putting them all together that takes
to make,

2178
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:05,160
like I saw the incredibles two yesterday
is it don't fucking incredible.

2179
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:08,160
The first one we're going to mean to say
incredible because it's an incredible,

2180
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:11,460
it's great we're considering taking bear
to that,

2181
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:13,530
but he's only three,
so we're not sure if you're a PR.

2182
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,840
He loves those movies at home,
but you know,

2183
01:39:15,841 --> 01:39:18,930
he talks and shit like that.
A little kids talk at the movie theater.

2184
01:39:18,931 --> 01:39:20,520
When you go to a little kid movies,
it's normal.

2185
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:22,050
Cool.
There's other little kids doing it too,

2186
01:39:22,051 --> 01:39:24,110
and we think we might do that for the 
incredibles two.

2187
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:25,620
It's so,
they're fucking so good.

2188
01:39:25,621 --> 01:39:28,050
The Pixar movies are so good.
Did you ever see the good dinosaur?

2189
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:30,570
Um,
that tells me I got gotta be honest.

2190
01:39:30,571 --> 01:39:31,404
That doesn't know why people don't.
If you go when a bunch of teenagers are 

2191
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:36,540
there or like young adults and the baby 
starts talking,

2192
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:40,300
they should be like a day like this 
should be certain shit.

2193
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:44,370
They do show the day and the kids are 
allowed to talk for show of the day in a

2194
01:39:44,371 --> 01:39:45,610
lot of theaters do.
Oh,

2195
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:48,240
see that's smart for the matinee.
That's smart.

2196
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:50,220
That's smart.
But Damn,

2197
01:39:50,221 --> 01:39:51,360
that's,
that opens up the door.

2198
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:52,590
If you tell them they're allowed to 
talk.

2199
01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:53,910
Yeah,
that's true.

2200
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:54,773
It's still try to keep it quiet,
but do a good dinosaur pixar movie and 

2201
01:39:58,381 --> 01:40:01,080
they fucking trip balls in the movie.
Oh yeah.

2202
01:40:01,081 --> 01:40:03,640
What did I eat?
Like some rotten fruit and,

2203
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:06,540
and the fucking green dinosaur grows 
like four eyes.

2204
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:08,850
Then they switch heads and they're 
running through everywhere.

2205
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:09,863
I forgot what each other's schools.
He sticks his tongue out and he's got 

2206
01:40:12,451 --> 01:40:15,480
the kid's face for his tongue was 
awesome.

2207
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:18,690
I forgot all about the trickling it in.
This society is changing,

2208
01:40:19,110 --> 01:40:20,670
you think?
Yeah.

2209
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:22,110
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah,

2210
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:24,060
it's the renaissance.
Michael Pollan said that,

2211
01:40:24,061 --> 01:40:26,970
and he's not even an advocate.
He knows it's challenging.

2212
01:40:26,971 --> 01:40:30,600
He's kind of more of an advocate now,
certainly than he was before.

2213
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:33,300
He wrote that book,
his most recent book on psychedelics.

2214
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,673
It that changed his life.
I think it's a smart play if you're a 

2215
01:40:38,311 --> 01:40:40,080
person in his position to say like,
look,

2216
01:40:40,081 --> 01:40:42,240
I'm just an advocate for the science.
Right?

2217
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:44,970
But as Rick Doblin says,
you know,

2218
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:45,893
if the stuff,
when this stuff becomes available to 

2219
01:40:47,701 --> 01:40:48,960
people,
it's never going to be,

2220
01:40:48,961 --> 01:40:49,794
you go fill your fucking prescription of
Siliciden at walgreens and you can go 

2221
01:40:52,471 --> 01:40:54,010
fuck off anywhere you want.
Right.

2222
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:57,910
They'll have facility centers where 
people can go and it'll be guided.

2223
01:40:57,911 --> 01:41:01,150
The right circumstances set and setting 
will be paid attention to.

2224
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,583
But in that experience,
like it shouldn't just be for sick 

2225
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:07,054
people.
It shouldn't just be for people with 

2226
01:41:07,871 --> 01:41:10,570
depression or ptsd or some type of,
you know,

2227
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:12,700
uh,
rape victims w fill in the blank.

2228
01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:13,534
It should be healthy individuals that 
also want to have a deeper connection 

2229
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,720
and to figure shit out and have new 
perspective in life.

2230
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:20,740
Right.
And Paul and I would,

2231
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:24,220
I would qualify as that.
I think he's a healthy guy.

2232
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:25,960
You know,
the heart,

2233
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:26,794
heart shit aside.
Like he's a healthy guy who wanted to 

2234
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:29,703
have an experience that would draw him 
in a little deeper so he can understand 

2235
01:41:32,201 --> 01:41:33,034
it.
Now when you listen to him talk about 

2236
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:34,384
it,
there's no doubt he's fucking sold on 

2237
01:41:35,231 --> 01:41:36,340
it.
Yeah.

2238
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:37,293
I think what you're saying is really 
important because I don't think there 

2239
01:41:38,561 --> 01:41:41,020
should be any restrictions on something 
that's super beneficial.

2240
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,470
If there's no real indications that it's
hurting these people.

2241
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,020
And it's all these indications that it's
helping these people,

2242
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:49,150
especially when it comes to trauma.
Look,

2243
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:49,984
man,
there's certain people that for sure 

2244
01:41:52,521 --> 01:41:55,190
have experienced way more trauma than 
others.

2245
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:56,990
There's certain people that have,
you know,

2246
01:41:56,991 --> 01:41:59,630
been to war,
they've lost friends,

2247
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:01,460
they've been involved in car accidents.
There's,

2248
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:02,303
there's,
there's certain people that have been 

2249
01:42:02,901 --> 01:42:03,734
through things that are just horrific 
and almost impossible to forget and the 

2250
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:08,833
dad is a fact that they should have 
access to this medicine but did it just 

2251
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:13,124
because like some girl lived her life 
and didn't have anything traumatic 

2252
01:42:17,481 --> 01:42:18,314
happen to her and she's trying to find 
her way in this world and she's trying 

2253
01:42:20,511 --> 01:42:21,650
to figure out,
you know,

2254
01:42:21,651 --> 01:42:22,484
what his insecurity or what is my 
connection to these people when we'll 

2255
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:27,850
whatever my real passions and drives in 
life.

2256
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:28,723
She says I'm going to take a uh,
some sort of a mdm may molly trip and 

2257
01:42:33,951 --> 01:42:36,380
find out how I feel about things is find
out of it.

2258
01:42:36,381 --> 01:42:38,610
It gives me anything.
She should be able to do it too.

2259
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:39,793
She be able to,
she should be able to experiment with 

2260
01:42:40,941 --> 01:42:43,190
their brain and see like,
hey,

2261
01:42:43,191 --> 01:42:45,770
all these people are reporting super 
positive experiences.

2262
01:42:45,771 --> 01:42:46,604
What am I supposed to ignore it?
Because some bureaucrat has decided for 

2263
01:42:49,731 --> 01:42:50,564
whatever connection they have.
Some pharmaceutical companies that you 

2264
01:42:53,091 --> 01:42:56,810
fucking keep this gate tight on making 
anything illegal.

2265
01:42:56,811 --> 01:42:57,644
Anything you make,
legal is going to fuck with my bottom 

2266
01:42:59,601 --> 01:43:01,550
line.
And that's what a lot of people think.

2267
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:02,713
And so there's this weird sort of 
disconnect between the people that want 

2268
01:43:06,291 --> 01:43:09,050
the drugs and the people that won't let 
you have the drugs.

2269
01:43:09,051 --> 01:43:12,080
Like who are you working for that people
that won't let us have the drugs.

2270
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:15,770
And why do these other people that don't
want the drugs think the drugs are bad?

2271
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:18,260
Do they have any pot experience 
themselves?

2272
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:20,390
No.
Well then you can't vote about pot.

2273
01:43:20,391 --> 01:43:21,950
You'd fuck,
you know,

2274
01:43:21,951 --> 01:43:23,810
I mean that's crazy,
right?

2275
01:43:23,811 --> 01:43:25,700
You shouldn't be a doctor unless you go 
to med school.

2276
01:43:25,970 --> 01:43:28,640
He shouldn't,
he shouldn't talk about driving a car.

2277
01:43:28,641 --> 01:43:33,641
If you've never driven a fucking car,
you know you can't talk about pod.

2278
01:43:34,221 --> 01:43:35,054
If you don't do it,
you don't know what you're talking 

2279
01:43:36,201 --> 01:43:36,611
about.
So,

2280
01:43:36,611 --> 01:43:37,460
oh,
you smoke pot,

2281
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:39,470
you got real high,
you got paranoid.

2282
01:43:39,471 --> 01:43:41,420
So everybody shouldn't smoke pot.
Fuck off

2283
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:42,110
pussy.
Oh,

2284
01:43:42,110 --> 01:43:43,520
that's Graham Hancock.
You don't,

2285
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:45,170
you always talking about Richard 
Dawkins.

2286
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:46,063
You don't have a seat at the fucking 
table to tell me what my Iowasca 

2287
01:43:49,071 --> 01:43:50,720
experiences.
Unless you've done it,

2288
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:52,130
you don't a seat at the table,

2289
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:55,100
you don't get to tell me at some neuro 
chemical reaction,

2290
01:43:55,101 --> 01:43:57,920
and this is where it fits in the brain.
If you haven't had that experience,

2291
01:43:57,921 --> 01:43:59,960
you can't tell me that that's,
and that's,

2292
01:43:59,961 --> 01:44:00,794
that's what's,
what's the one thing that's fucking odd 

2293
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:07,550
at the very least when people go through
these experiences and Poland talks about

2294
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:10,100
this too,
is how real it feels.

2295
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:13,730
It's how important it is and how much 
meaning they have.

2296
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,700
Right.
Nobody's going to fucking tell me that.

2297
01:44:16,701 --> 01:44:18,650
My Oscar Iowaska experience didn't mean 
shit.

2298
01:44:18,651 --> 01:44:19,484
I saw,
you know,

2299
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,353
in one of them,
my wife and I shared the same vision of 

2300
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:22,874
holding a child and the next experience 
we saw it was a boy and fucking all the 

2301
01:44:26,931 --> 01:44:31,640
fear of being a parent came up and less 
than a month later we were pregnant with

2302
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:34,850
bear.
Like that's as real as it fucking gets.

2303
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:37,610
And it manifested after that coincidence
or not.

2304
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:40,400
I have a real problem with the word real
to you know,

2305
01:44:40,401 --> 01:44:40,821
the,
when,

2306
01:44:40,821 --> 01:44:42,670
when people try to say that's not 
really,

2307
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:44,600
that's a hallucination.
It doesn't matter.

2308
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:48,110
It's the same experience like e what?
By saying it's not real.

2309
01:44:48,111 --> 01:44:48,944
So what are you saying?
You're saying that I can't grab it and 

2310
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:54,350
throw a fucking net over it and drag it 
away and then show it to you again.

2311
01:44:54,890 --> 01:44:56,330
Yeah.
Well then it's not real.

2312
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,580
You can't be repeated.
A double blind study.

2313
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:00,470
How would you say it's not real if it's 
happening?

2314
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:02,030
Yeah,
and you can't repeat that.

2315
01:45:02,031 --> 01:45:04,550
Eight.
Is that a weird take ios good rest of my

2316
01:45:04,551 --> 01:45:05,384
life and I'm still not going to repeat 
the same vision and the same fucking 

2317
01:45:07,491 --> 01:45:09,380
experience again.
Yeah.

2318
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:12,050
Anytime you think these different dmt 
figured out,

2319
01:45:12,051 --> 01:45:14,360
your next trip is going to be a mind 
bender.

2320
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:17,210
You're in your next trip,
you get cocky going in there.

2321
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:18,021
Like,
I've done this before.

2322
01:45:18,021 --> 01:45:19,910
I'm just pretty relaxed about my dmt 
trip.

2323
01:45:19,911 --> 01:45:21,610
So used to really freak you out,
but I don't want anymore,

2324
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:23,420
bitch.
You better be scared.

2325
01:45:23,770 --> 01:45:26,000
You better be scared.
You're white knuckling it right now.

2326
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:28,550
You're going to go deep and govern the 
government.

2327
01:45:28,551 --> 01:45:29,384
They said the same thing about Iowa.
He's done hundreds of ceremonies and 

2328
01:45:31,361 --> 01:45:33,800
he's still gets nervous every fucking 
time.

2329
01:45:33,801 --> 01:45:34,634
He did.
You get nervous before you do anything 

2330
01:45:35,361 --> 01:45:36,194
that's important.
So sign the [inaudible] getting ready 

2331
01:45:38,091 --> 01:45:39,410
for something crazy.
Well,

2332
01:45:39,411 --> 01:45:40,244
and there's a healthy level of respect.
I think most people would run into the 

2333
01:45:42,321 --> 01:45:43,190
issue,
you know,

2334
01:45:43,191 --> 01:45:44,024
they,
they want,

2335
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:45,313
they want to alter their consciousness 
and they'll take a substance thinking 

2336
01:45:48,111 --> 01:45:50,030
like this is going to make me feel a 
certain way.

2337
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,640
And then all of a sudden they got to 
deal with some shit.

2338
01:45:52,641 --> 01:45:53,660
They got to work through something.

2339
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:55,400
And that's not what they had on their 
radar.

2340
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:56,200
Right.
Yeah.

2341
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,620
No,
I agree.

2342
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,393
And then also this need to control.
The experience is always the thing that 

2343
01:46:02,681 --> 01:46:05,150
fucking sends everybody off the rails 
and into the woods.

2344
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:07,310
If they're having any kind of 
experience,

2345
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:09,200
this need to control that experience.
Like,

2346
01:46:09,201 --> 01:46:10,250
no,
there's no,

2347
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:11,031
no,
fuck this.

2348
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,480
I'm sitting down,
you know,

2349
01:46:12,481 --> 01:46:14,000
and like,
no man,

2350
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:15,350
you gotta let go.
If you don't let go,

2351
01:46:15,351 --> 01:46:17,240
you're gone.
And you've got to surrender to it.

2352
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:19,850
And if you don't,
you're going to go through 15 minutes of

2353
01:46:19,851 --> 01:46:20,684
Satan.
It was with my old man in Panama at the 

2354
01:46:23,361 --> 01:46:26,540
tribal gathering and we were both doing 
a wasc a ceremony together.

2355
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:29,300
And uh,
we had the first cup and it's strong,

2356
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:32,450
like should people sharman came in 
fucking amazing experience.

2357
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:33,373
And uh,
they offered the second cup and I'm 

2358
01:46:34,131 --> 01:46:34,821
like,
get up dude.

2359
01:46:34,821 --> 01:46:35,690
We're doing it.
And he's like,

2360
01:46:35,770 --> 01:46:36,980
hello.
And I'm like,

2361
01:46:36,981 --> 01:46:37,814
come on,
let's go.

2362
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:41,420
So we take the second cup,
we come lay back down and I've had,

2363
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:43,140
I mean to Ballpark,
I've,

2364
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:47,420
there's been ceremonies where I've had 
four cups and it was launch,

2365
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:49,010
you know,
this two cup,

2366
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,220
that's where we were fucking

2367
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:53,660
launched.
So we go back into the teepee and uh,

2368
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:55,020
you know,
noble silence,

2369
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:57,420
we're not talking to each other and he 
just grabs my arm and he's like,

2370
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:59,550
I'm going to leave.
I'm floating out of here.

2371
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,930
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

2372
01:47:00,931 --> 01:47:02,430
And I was like,
fuck yeah,

2373
01:47:02,431 --> 01:47:03,330
dude,
let go,

2374
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:04,380
let go.
Go with it.

2375
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:06,750
Now's your opportunity to let go,
see where it takes you.

2376
01:47:06,751 --> 01:47:07,584
And he's like,
no,

2377
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:08,820
no,
I'm not letting go.

2378
01:47:08,821 --> 01:47:10,260
I went down,
I want down right now.

2379
01:47:10,261 --> 01:47:11,340
It's too much.
I'm too high.

2380
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:12,040
And I'm like,
wow,

2381
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:12,873
he's not the right term.
And this other guy from Switzerland 

2382
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:16,620
heard us and he goes,
uh,

2383
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,470
he'll rub some,
uh,

2384
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:20,340
peppermint on his,
on his wrist.

2385
01:47:20,341 --> 01:47:23,130
It will help him come over and put 
peppermint oil.

2386
01:47:23,131 --> 01:47:25,860
And that grounded him.
Now after that,

2387
01:47:25,861 --> 01:47:26,694
you know,
he's done Iowaska since then and he was 

2388
01:47:27,661 --> 01:47:29,730
like,
fuck,

2389
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:32,850
that was my opportunity to fucking break
through and go,

2390
01:47:33,010 --> 01:47:35,940
it's deeper than I've ever been before,
but I wasn't prepared.

2391
01:47:35,941 --> 01:47:38,100
I wasn't ready to let go and surrender 
to it.

2392
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:39,540
Wow.
And that's,

2393
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:40,403
that's it man.
You want to have that mindset going in 

2394
01:47:42,031 --> 01:47:44,430
where if you face some shit,
it's okay.

2395
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:45,773
And if you have the opportunity,
especially getting fucking DMT or 

2396
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:49,830
Iowasca,
which is dmt base,

2397
01:47:49,831 --> 01:47:51,210
like to have that ability,
like,

2398
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,740
all right,
the answer is yes.

2399
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:53,170
You

2400
01:47:53,170 --> 01:47:57,040
wonder what the guys who created yoga 
we're doing.

2401
01:47:58,030 --> 01:47:59,500
I think,
I think those people,

2402
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:00,343
like those people that learn how to do 
those long holding poses and that they 

2403
01:48:04,571 --> 01:48:05,710
were practicing it,
you know,

2404
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:08,920
there's a lot of belief that those 
people were eating a lot of Hash.

2405
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,820
Like especially the,
the earliest people that were,

2406
01:48:11,890 --> 01:48:15,060
that created it and they were so ma,
whatever the fuck soma was,

2407
01:48:15,061 --> 01:48:17,460
you ever hear references to Soma?
I don't like,

2408
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:18,760
I don't even think they know what that 
is.

2409
01:48:18,761 --> 01:48:23,620
Some sort of a psychedelic,
but that whole practice of yoga,

2410
01:48:23,740 --> 01:48:25,990
if you really think about it,
a lot of what yoga is like,

2411
01:48:25,991 --> 01:48:30,220
you have to just breathe and just 
concentrate on maintaining the pose.

2412
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:32,980
You have to put yourself into this like 
surrender zone.

2413
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,290
You know,
you can't like fight a position.

2414
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:36,303
He just Kinda Kinda accepted and just 
concentrate on breathing and hold it as 

2415
01:48:39,041 --> 01:48:41,740
long as you can until your body starts 
giving out.

2416
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:42,633
And then you let it go again.
But I think that prepares you in some 

2417
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:47,590
way to let go in psychedelic 
experiences.

2418
01:48:47,591 --> 01:48:50,780
I think that people that don't have any,
um,

2419
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:55,120
if you don't have any kind of physical 
altercation with your body,

2420
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:56,740
there's no like moment where you're 
like,

2421
01:48:56,741 --> 01:48:57,650
come on man,
come on Bri,

2422
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:58,220
Bri,
Bri,

2423
01:48:58,220 --> 01:48:58,691
go,
go,

2424
01:48:58,691 --> 01:49:00,070
go.
If you don't have any of those,

2425
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:01,031
if he never,
I mean,

2426
01:49:01,031 --> 01:49:04,290
I don't give a fuck what you're doing,
whether it's a spin class or just,

2427
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:05,253
if you never have anything where you're 
pushing yourself when you don't want to 

2428
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:09,100
do it,
but you make yourself do it and then you

2429
01:49:09,101 --> 01:49:10,660
did it.
If you don't have those,

2430
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:11,673
like those little moments where you 
overcame something that feels 

2431
01:49:14,441 --> 01:49:16,570
uncomfortable,
then those,

2432
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:17,463
those bends in the trip road or scary 
dark because you don't have any success 

2433
01:49:21,761 --> 01:49:22,594
in coming back from bad states.
You don't have any success from and 

2434
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:26,643
coming back from like feeling really 
scared or feeling really nervous like 

2435
01:49:30,311 --> 01:49:33,850
those build up a database if you don't 
have a lot of success in doing those are

2436
01:49:33,851 --> 01:49:38,020
especially a success and getting your 
body to just fucking relax,

2437
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:39,910
just fucking relax.
It's just a broken leg.

2438
01:49:40,030 --> 01:49:45,030
If you don't have that in you like it's,
it's probably real hard to navigate some

2439
01:49:45,611 --> 01:49:48,100
of the darker roads of a where you just

2440
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:48,933
have to just have a,
just kind of just breathe and just try 

2441
01:49:51,321 --> 01:49:55,000
to stay as calm as you can.
Let an embrace you as calm as you can.

2442
01:49:55,180 --> 01:49:56,060
Well,
I think that it,

2443
01:49:56,061 --> 01:49:58,570
it works both ways too.
You know like you have,

2444
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:04,930
if you put yourself in uncomfortable,
stressful spots in everyday life,

2445
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:08,170
like a cold bath or the Cryo and you 
come and you can stay calm in the,

2446
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:10,240
in the fucking eye of the storm and come
out of that.

2447
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:11,613
That extrapolates out in life.
Somebody cuts you off in traffic you're 

2448
01:50:14,561 --> 01:50:15,394
a little bit more chill.
It's not that big of a deal and same 

2449
01:50:17,171 --> 01:50:19,300
thing in the psychedelic experience that
you go through some rough shit.

2450
01:50:19,301 --> 01:50:20,500
You come out of that.
Okay,

2451
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:21,940
all right.
I still have my body.

2452
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:23,223
I was able to work through that now it 
kind of lowers the noise on all the 

2453
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:27,040
bullshit in life.

2454
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:28,330
Yeah,
I agree.

2455
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:29,373
I think there's something to what you 
just said about doing cryo to the Cryo 

2456
01:50:33,011 --> 01:50:36,820
does make you chill out after,
I mean for lack of a better term,

2457
01:50:36,821 --> 01:50:38,940
no pun intended,
but your,

2458
01:50:38,941 --> 01:50:39,880
um,
your,

2459
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:40,630
the,
the,

2460
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:42,640
everything is so elevated after you get 
out of there,

2461
01:50:42,641 --> 01:50:44,440
you feel so good that it's,
so,

2462
01:50:44,441 --> 01:50:45,274
that's a,
that's a feeling that like if there was 

2463
01:50:47,801 --> 01:50:48,634
a way to do that in a spray,
if you could buy that feelgood sprayed 

2464
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:51,963
seven 11 and give yourself a couple of 
pumps the same way you feel right after 

2465
01:50:54,161 --> 01:50:55,300
Cryo,
it would hit.

2466
01:50:55,301 --> 01:50:56,980
You'd be like,
Whoa,

2467
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:58,840
you just get this,
Ooh,

2468
01:50:59,030 --> 01:51:00,850
come out.
And all of a sudden your body feels warm

2469
01:51:00,851 --> 01:51:01,930
again.
You feel great.

2470
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:06,120
It's a nice little trick.
It's a very nice little trick and it,

2471
01:51:06,121 --> 01:51:06,954
and it helps so many people in so many 
different ways with the arthritis and 

2472
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:14,380
people have constant inflammation and 
back problems,

2473
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:15,490
knee problems.

2474
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:16,833
It just,
there's such a good way to just give 

2475
01:51:19,271 --> 01:51:22,540
your body just a little extra reduction 
in inflammation.

2476
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:24,880
Just give yourself a little jolt.
Ah,

2477
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,220
oh.
Oh.

2478
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:29,650
It feels good man.
People through it.

2479
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:32,290
I don't understand the poo pooing of it.
They're looking at it now.

2480
01:51:32,291 --> 01:51:34,180
There's,
they're studying Wim Hoff at Stanford.

2481
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:38,080
They see 550% increase in dopamine.
Wow.

2482
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:38,973
200 to 300% increase in a adrenaline,
which impacts the immune system 

2483
01:51:42,341 --> 01:51:45,190
positively.
How long of a Wynn Hoff,

2484
01:51:45,191 --> 01:51:47,710
they have very different,
they have different levels of cold.

2485
01:51:47,711 --> 01:51:50,590
They're studying at one minute,
at 60 degrees,

2486
01:51:50,591 --> 01:51:52,780
you know,
or 10 minutes is 60 degrees,

2487
01:51:52,781 --> 01:51:54,040
one minute,
30 degrees.

2488
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:55,360
And then they're trying to,
they're going to,

2489
01:51:55,361 --> 01:51:56,194
there's going to be more science that 
comes out on different cause I want to 

2490
01:51:57,551 --> 01:52:00,340
know like how long at 40 how long in the
Cryo,

2491
01:52:00,341 --> 01:52:01,174
how long does it,
but we know there's some type of 

2492
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:06,280
neurochemical response from it.

2493
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:07,780
Right.
And feel right.

2494
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,820
Yeah.
So it's not just this,

2495
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:11,620
you know,
it's not placebo.

2496
01:52:11,621 --> 01:52:13,570
It's not just your mind making this up 
or man,

2497
01:52:13,571 --> 01:52:15,160
I feel really good.
I think something's changed.

2498
01:52:15,161 --> 01:52:15,450
Like,
no,

2499
01:52:15,450 --> 01:52:16,600
you're,
you are,

2500
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:18,370
you are changing.
It does have an impact.

2501
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:19,343
Well just and also stop and think about 
all the people that were always scared 

2502
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:23,194
of the fucking vikings and the Russians 
are scared of people coming out of the 

2503
01:52:27,131 --> 01:52:28,440
snow,
you know,

2504
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:33,600
and the white walkers probably was 
probably something in our head.

2505
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:36,760
It was someone who could survive the 
snow that we can't like,

2506
01:52:36,761 --> 01:52:38,590
fuck,
he's going to be secure to be cold.

2507
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:41,260
You know?
I mean that that is who,

2508
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:44,520
who's the scariest people in this 
country are the toughest Alaskans.

2509
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:45,800
It's mother fucker.
They have shows.

2510
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:46,070
They

2511
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,590
have like 10 shows.
There's only a hundred people in Alaska.

2512
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,840
They got 10 shows up.
People living in Alaska,

2513
01:52:51,810 --> 01:52:55,430
there's too many fucking shows.
So many of those shows there's,

2514
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,110
I know there's millions of people live 
in Alaska.

2515
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:58,190
Maybe not even,
right?

2516
01:52:58,220 --> 01:52:59,053
No,
it's not even it didn't we already go 

2517
01:53:00,321 --> 01:53:02,720
over this like anchorage is like 400,000
people.

2518
01:53:02,721 --> 01:53:06,320
I think I might've made that up.
What's the number?

2519
01:53:06,330 --> 01:53:09,050
740,000
for the whole state.

2520
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,390
Whoa.
How many people does anchorage have?

2521
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:13,723
700,
well not even a million for the whole 

2522
01:53:14,661 --> 01:53:15,494
state,
but there's like 18 shows on people 

2523
01:53:17,331 --> 01:53:18,590
living in,
in Alaska.

2524
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:20,120
But there are hardy people.
You look at him,

2525
01:53:20,121 --> 01:53:20,720
you're like,
Cam,

2526
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:23,570
what would I do?
Three to 400,000.

2527
01:53:23,571 --> 01:53:24,170
Yeah.
Yeah,

2528
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:25,700
so it was probably right.
Um,

2529
01:53:25,701 --> 01:53:27,770
so that's like an anchorage is like a 
real spot,

2530
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:28,753
like a real city sorta.
I mean real nice bars and restaurants 

2531
01:53:31,101 --> 01:53:31,934
and chill like that.

2532
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:35,570
But these shows about those people that 
live up there,

2533
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,433
those are all the people that live in 
like the Arctic Circle area and they 

2534
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:42,380
chop their own fucking firewood and 
fight wolves off and shit.

2535
01:53:42,381 --> 01:53:43,214
Like this is one dude,
we've talked about him several times in 

2536
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:47,270
the podcast.
It lives by himself.

2537
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:48,133
He's the one of the weirdest of all.
Like he's the weirdest of all the weird 

2538
01:53:50,871 --> 01:53:51,704
people because all these other people 
live in like regular houses and you 

2539
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:55,394
know,
they just live in a house that's 

2540
01:53:55,971 --> 01:53:56,804
connected to this river and they take 
their dogs dog sledding and they do a 

2541
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:01,430
shit.
But they live in like a normal house.

2542
01:54:01,431 --> 01:54:02,264
They go into a house.
This motherfucker has like this tiny 

2543
01:54:05,031 --> 01:54:05,864
shack and he lives right next to a lake 
and he lives by himself and he walks 

2544
01:54:09,681 --> 01:54:10,514
everywhere and he somehow or another 
gets like Peltz and shit and makes 

2545
01:54:14,151 --> 01:54:19,151
enough money to buy bullets and he lives
out there by himself and he'll come into

2546
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:21,920
town like once every couple of years 
apparently used to be married.

2547
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:24,320
He's to have a family,
fascinating guy.

2548
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:25,813
I mean this guy's not faking and he's 
actually really living up there by 

2549
01:54:28,101 --> 01:54:28,934
himself in this room that's way smaller 
than the studio and he lives by himself 

2550
01:54:32,931 --> 01:54:33,764
next to a lake and he had a shoot wolves
one night because they were coming for 

2551
01:54:36,561 --> 01:54:41,561
his fucking Mousse or as Caribou.
The whole thing's crazy like by himself.

2552
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,190
Nobody talked to I think.
I think that might be a draw for people,

2553
01:54:46,191 --> 01:54:47,024
especially if there is some merging of 
consciousness and integration with with 

2554
01:54:50,351 --> 01:54:55,351
the technology down the road like that,
that kind of fuck this,

2555
01:54:55,461 --> 01:54:56,294
I'm going off the beaten path and you 
already see that people want to be off 

2556
01:54:58,221 --> 01:54:59,054
the grid but to truly be like balls deep
in nature where you have to deal with 

2557
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,240
wolves and bears and all the shit that's
going on like that.

2558
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:07,160
That might be a bigger draw down the 
road.

2559
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:09,050
Right now I'm,
I'm not interested in that shit.

2560
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:10,550
Well I'm not interested in that shit 
either,

2561
01:55:10,551 --> 01:55:11,384
but I'm interested in him being 
interested in it because I think that 

2562
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:16,340
what you were just saying about 
technology,

2563
01:55:16,341 --> 01:55:18,170
but I thought you were going to say is 
about nature.

2564
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:19,183
I think there's a deeper connection to 
nature if you just live in it all the 

2565
01:55:23,421 --> 01:55:28,130
time.
I know that you get weird senses of like

2566
01:55:28,131 --> 01:55:30,040
where things are,
where,

2567
01:55:30,041 --> 01:55:30,874
how,
how the wind feels when it's coming at 

2568
01:55:32,451 --> 01:55:32,691
you.
Oh,

2569
01:55:32,691 --> 01:55:35,090
it's definitely coming this way.
Like you know,

2570
01:55:35,091 --> 01:55:37,670
you know where to stand.
We're not to like,

2571
01:55:37,671 --> 01:55:40,400
you get a sense of the whole thing and 
you're a part of it.

2572
01:55:40,401 --> 01:55:44,010
You're not talking to anybody.
So the only the dialogue you

2573
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,810
have is internal.
It's like a,

2574
01:55:45,811 --> 01:55:48,600
your buddy who fast swanee hunt.
Yeah.

2575
01:55:48,601 --> 01:55:50,760
Right.
You get that extra sensory coming in.

2576
01:55:51,250 --> 01:55:52,140
Yeah,
yeah,

2577
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:54,530
yeah.
Remy warrant always talked about that,

2578
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,040
that you should hunt hungry.
That's primal shit dude.

2579
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:01,640
That makes sense though.
It,

2580
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,170
yeah,
totally makes sense.

2581
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,190
Totally.
I found out,

2582
01:56:04,191 --> 01:56:05,200
I mean,
doing the fasting,

2583
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:08,150
I've done two five day fast now the 
brain,

2584
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:09,620
it doesn't,
it's not like,

2585
01:56:09,650 --> 01:56:11,840
I mean I have extra energy.
Sleep kind of goes to shit,

2586
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:12,973
you know,
and Michael Walker talked a bit about 

2587
01:56:13,641 --> 01:56:15,410
that.
But um,

2588
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:19,000
I can't sit and read.
Like I can't just focus in like,

2589
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:19,853
all right,
I'm,

2590
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:20,713
my brain's turned on.
Let me just bang out emails or fucking 

2591
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,800
read a book.
Like it doesn't work that way,

2592
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:25,663
but I do start to problem solve in a way
that's not possible and not common when 

2593
01:56:31,281 --> 01:56:33,770
I'm eating food all the time.
It just works differently.

2594
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:35,600
Like all this other shit turns on.

2595
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:37,673
Wow.

2596
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,460
Now when you were talking earlier about 
this creative experience [inaudible] how

2597
01:56:43,461 --> 01:56:47,180
many times have you done Kratom well,
I have a boatload of it.

2598
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:48,220
Uh,
so,

2599
01:56:50,030 --> 01:56:52,010
um,
I mean,

2600
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:53,650
I don't know.
I mean I,

2601
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:55,580
I've lost track of how many times I've 
done it,

2602
01:56:55,581 --> 01:56:58,400
but usually when I do it,
it is that that one to two pill dose.

2603
01:56:58,430 --> 01:57:00,980
I don't exceed that often.
You're a guy who,

2604
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:01,843
the reason why I ask is you're a guy who
is always on top of all the latest and 

2605
01:57:05,571 --> 01:57:07,850
greatest in terms of like 
supplementation,

2606
01:57:07,851 --> 01:57:08,684
the benefits of certain things.
How do you know when to stick them in 

2607
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:14,180
and like when to lay off other stuff?
Cause how do you know,

2608
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:15,043
because you're not necessarily getting 
your blood tests all the time after you 

2609
01:57:17,091 --> 01:57:18,260
do some of these things,
right?

2610
01:57:18,290 --> 01:57:19,370
No,
I do blood work,

2611
01:57:19,430 --> 01:57:20,300
you know,
fairly often.

2612
01:57:20,301 --> 01:57:23,000
But that's just more for general health 
and wellness.

2613
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,800
It's not to see how things are impacting
me,

2614
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:25,910
you know?
Do,

2615
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:27,353
do you like have a detailed analysis of 
like what you were taking and the days 

2616
01:57:30,921 --> 01:57:34,010
before blood work and then compare it to
times?

2617
01:57:34,011 --> 01:57:35,840
We're not taking those things.
Most of the thing,

2618
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:36,733
the thing that has the biggest impact on
my blood work as if I'm in Ketosis or 

2619
01:57:38,901 --> 01:57:39,734
not,
you know,

2620
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:41,480
there's,
there's no fucking doubt.

2621
01:57:41,481 --> 01:57:42,860
And that's also genetic.
You know,

2622
01:57:42,861 --> 01:57:45,110
it's not the fucking right diet for 
everyone.

2623
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:48,380
Um,
that's a pain the ass to here.

2624
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:49,161
Like,
well,

2625
01:57:49,161 --> 01:57:51,560
what the fuck the right one for me,
man.

2626
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:54,380
You got to figure that out.
You know,

2627
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,000
and wired to eat.
It's a game changer.

2628
01:57:56,210 --> 01:57:58,370
It really is very good.
But you gotta,

2629
01:57:58,371 --> 01:58:00,590
you gotta do your fucking homework.
You know what I'm saying?

2630
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:03,740
Rob Actually puts it into action on his 
instagram page.

2631
01:58:03,741 --> 01:58:06,140
Robb wolf and his wife will eat the 
exact same thing.

2632
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:10,010
And then he tests ketone levels and 
blood sugar and blood sugar levels,

2633
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:10,873
like at the same timestamp.
And his and hers are radically 

2634
01:58:14,541 --> 01:58:16,640
different.
Like she's just better at serving stuff.

2635
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:17,540
Yeah,
exactly.

2636
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:20,000
And so I'm similar to him genetically in
that,

2637
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:21,223
um,
I don't do well with a lot of 

2638
01:58:22,371 --> 01:58:23,204
carbohydrates and like a wide variety.
I can eat a plate of yams and my blood 

2639
01:58:26,541 --> 01:58:27,374
sugar looks fine,
but if I have a little bit of white 

2640
01:58:28,341 --> 01:58:29,900
rice,
I'm fucking through the roof.

2641
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:30,763
Like pre diabetic.
Did you listen to the podcast that I 

2642
01:58:33,411 --> 01:58:34,580
did?
Was Zack bitter?

2643
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:37,430
No,
he's the guy that holds the world record

2644
01:58:37,431 --> 01:58:40,940
for running a hundred miles in America.
He ran a hundred miles,

2645
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:45,850
literally ran a seven minute pace for 11
hours.

2646
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:48,580
Damn.
Damn.

2647
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:50,770
Yeah.
That's the only thing that you could say

2648
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:51,783
11 hours and 40 minutes.
I think it was the total that is so 

2649
01:58:54,431 --> 01:58:55,380
fucking crazy.

2650
01:58:55,390 --> 01:59:00,160
You can run seven minute miles for 11 
hours and 40 minutes.

2651
01:59:00,161 --> 01:59:03,280
Just keep going with ptosis.
Or was he,

2652
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,440
was he,
most of the time he's in Ketosis.

2653
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:07,660
He eats a very,
uh,

2654
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:11,410
meet rich diet and he is a fat burner.
He,

2655
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:15,340
he's in Ketosis all the time.
It takes all kinds of,

2656
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:16,930
you know,
crazy.

2657
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:19,570
Well,
he was talking about his diet.

2658
01:59:19,571 --> 01:59:21,970
Like one of the things that he eats more
than anything was steak.

2659
01:59:21,971 --> 01:59:23,710
Right.
That was like his big thing,

2660
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:26,710
like fatty piece of meat.
And,

2661
01:59:26,711 --> 01:59:28,540
um,
when he runs though,

2662
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:32,860
when he's involved in a race or anything
where there's extremely,

2663
01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:36,880
um,
extremely high requirements on his body,

2664
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:38,013
then he goes way above like ketosis 
levels of carbohydrates like androids 

2665
01:59:41,831 --> 01:59:44,290
and hundreds of grams during the race.
That's,

2666
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:46,320
that's totally what you should do.
And that's,

2667
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:49,990
I'd ran that 50 k after I was on your 
show last here it says,

2668
01:59:50,230 --> 01:59:51,610
he says what's even more surprising?

2669
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:56,610
Those bitter trains and compete complete
competes on almost no carbs at times.

2670
01:59:57,221 --> 02:00:02,221
Carbs account for as little as 5% of his
diet and bitter insists that even we non

2671
02:00:02,641 --> 02:00:04,720
endurance record holders to do the same.
Yeah.

2672
02:00:04,721 --> 02:00:07,420
But remember he was talking about when 
he did the races,

2673
02:00:07,421 --> 02:00:09,760
he takes some glucose supplements,
right?

2674
02:00:09,761 --> 02:00:10,990
Article about his whole,
yeah,

2675
02:00:10,991 --> 02:00:12,150
I think it means,
um,

2676
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:13,083
most of the time,
most of the time when it's eating and 

2677
02:00:14,831 --> 02:00:19,120
training and exercising,
he's burning almost no carbs.

2678
02:00:19,150 --> 02:00:20,560
Well that's the goal though.
Yeah,

2679
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:23,320
that's metabolic flexibility.
The goal is if we've,

2680
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:24,183
if we're from out the gate,
we eat carbohydrates every fucking meal 

2681
02:00:27,730 --> 02:00:30,610
until we're 40.
We're not making ketones.

2682
02:00:30,611 --> 02:00:31,444
Our body doesn't know how to use fat for
fuel if we at least spend a period of 

2683
02:00:33,551 --> 02:00:34,780
time.
And that's what I do now.

2684
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:39,250
I'll spend about six months a year in 
Ketosis with maybe a couple of carb days

2685
02:00:39,390 --> 02:00:41,140
in,
in a whole six month span.

2686
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:44,800
And then after that I'll practice some 
carb backloading or maybe I'll have,

2687
02:00:44,801 --> 02:00:46,180
you know,
higher carbohydrate days,

2688
02:00:46,181 --> 02:00:49,630
but I'm still eating higher fat,
higher protein throughout that and,

2689
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:52,780
or moderate protein throughout that,
that creates flexibility.

2690
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:54,220
That's what we're designed to do.
You know,

2691
02:00:54,221 --> 02:00:55,054
you can argue all you want about what 
fucken Paleo man eight and all that 

2692
02:00:57,431 --> 02:00:58,264
shit.
But the truth is before refrigeration 

2693
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:05,320
and before shipping,
we did not have access to carbohydrates.

2694
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:06,213
Most of the people on this planet didn't
have access for at least three months 

2695
02:01:08,171 --> 02:01:09,340
out of the year.
Right?

2696
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:10,810
Yeah.
So I mean,

2697
02:01:10,811 --> 02:01:11,644
there's,
there's at least a period of time where 

2698
02:01:12,491 --> 02:01:13,324
we could,
should take off and allow our body to 

2699
02:01:14,981 --> 02:01:15,814
reset and start to burn fat for fuel.
And then when we go back to eating 

2700
02:01:19,061 --> 02:01:21,010
carbohydrates,
we utilize it a little bit better.

2701
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:22,780
Well,
there's also people like the [inaudible]

2702
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:26,050
who didn't eat any vegetables at all.
Yeah.

2703
02:01:26,051 --> 02:01:26,884
But I think even with them two months 
out of the year when they'd grow 

2704
02:01:29,441 --> 02:01:30,274
seasonally,
they'd eat a little bit more 

2705
02:01:31,091 --> 02:01:33,220
carbohydrates and probably not be fully 
Kido.

2706
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,620
What do you think the time of the year,
what do you think they would eat?

2707
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:37,300
Whatever the fuck grow.
Cause they grow.

2708
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:39,890
I'm sure two months out of the year they
can grow some shit,

2709
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,690
man.
I don't even know.

2710
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:44,330
Are there spots where they can never 
grow anything all year round?

2711
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:47,030
Possibly.
I don't think it's going to hurt them.

2712
02:01:47,031 --> 02:01:50,390
I disagree with,
with people that think you should be one

2713
02:01:50,391 --> 02:01:53,270
or the other year round.
Know like the same dumb ass argument.

2714
02:01:53,271 --> 02:01:55,040
You should only eat plants the rest of 
your life.

2715
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:56,373
Yeah.
Like it to be cute or the rest of your 

2716
02:01:57,321 --> 02:01:58,700
life.
I think you're missing the point.

2717
02:01:58,701 --> 02:01:59,534
The point is to have your body finally 
tuned and adaptable and able to to eat 

2718
02:02:03,261 --> 02:02:04,700
all things.
Intermittent.

2719
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:06,980
Fasting is good way to go about that.
Um,

2720
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:07,873
and when I do that regularly,
when I get like three or four days in a 

2721
02:02:11,661 --> 02:02:12,494
row,
there's a noticeable difference in like 

2722
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:14,413
the need to eat like that,
that feeling that inflammation goes 

2723
02:02:17,541 --> 02:02:19,340
down,
cognitive function goes up,

2724
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:21,230
sleep's improved.
We have this,

2725
02:02:21,231 --> 02:02:22,550
a lot of benefits to it for sure.

2726
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:25,910
Some people are going crazy with it and 
doing 20 and four and I'm like,

2727
02:02:25,911 --> 02:02:26,750
wow,
that's,

2728
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:29,540
that's a,
but not a terrible idea.

2729
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:31,670
Not a terrible idea.
I interviewed this guy,

2730
02:02:31,671 --> 02:02:34,100
todd white,
who's the CEO of dry farm wines.

2731
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:38,240
He does that every fucking day fast for 
20 hours.

2732
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:40,850
He'll have a bottle or two of the dry 
farm with his dinner.

2733
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:42,110
Hmm.
That's it.

2734
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,210
That's his fucking deal.
And he's shredded.

2735
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:45,140
Like I met,
met,

2736
02:02:45,141 --> 02:02:49,730
met him at Paleo fx this year and it was
curious to me because everybody that's a

2737
02:02:49,731 --> 02:02:51,170
part of that is,
you know,

2738
02:02:51,171 --> 02:02:53,210
their health oriented,
they're kind of dialed in.

2739
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:54,920
At least they're on track.
They,

2740
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:57,260
you know,
they work out that you can be a fat guy,

2741
02:02:57,261 --> 02:02:58,730
had a Paleo festival.
They pay,

2742
02:02:59,210 --> 02:03:01,670
they pay attention to what they're 
putting in the body and how they move.

2743
02:03:01,671 --> 02:03:02,504
Right?
Yeah.

2744
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:05,030
But,
but at every kiosk or every,

2745
02:03:05,031 --> 02:03:05,864
every little booth,
not everyone looks the part at this 

2746
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:09,314
guy's booth.

2747
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:10,213
Everyone's fucking shredded.
Everyone's got a giant smile on their 

2748
02:03:12,441 --> 02:03:13,071
face.
I was like,

2749
02:03:13,071 --> 02:03:14,540
what's the fucking deal?
And he's like,

2750
02:03:14,541 --> 02:03:16,370
well,
18 out of 20 of us are Kido.

2751
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:18,590
Almost all of us do intermittent 
fasting.

2752
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:21,860
Uh,
they have group meditation every,

2753
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:23,480
not that that would help with fat loss,
but I mean,

2754
02:03:23,481 --> 02:03:27,860
just to say that they're dialed in group
meditation every fucking day at 9:00

2755
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:29,870
AM their entire company,
while the keys,

2756
02:03:29,871 --> 02:03:33,770
he's a fucking legit guy to him.
Meditation with the whole company,

2757
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:36,290
with the entire company.
How many dudes just thinking about dicks

2758
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:40,430
and angry it,
they have to do group meditation.

2759
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:42,500
They think about,
visualize this,

2760
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:46,560
visualize those guys doing the Dick 
exercises nonstop with the weights to be

2761
02:03:46,561 --> 02:03:47,331
like,
with my Dick look,

2762
02:03:47,331 --> 02:03:49,310
or it wasn't circumcised.
What would it look like?

2763
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:53,920
A picture,
they'd probably,

2764
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:57,140
it probably added half an inch or he 
could just shoot stem cells into it,

2765
02:03:57,141 --> 02:03:58,490
like Greenfield to get the half inch.

2766
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:02,210
Those guys who are doing those,
like is that a mandatory thing?

2767
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:03,830
Do you have to do it to work at the 
company?

2768
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:05,630
To the group meditation?
I think it's,

2769
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:06,860
I think it's a requirement.
Yeah,

2770
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:11,300
that'd be annoying if I think it'd be 
good once you fucking got into it.

2771
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:14,660
Maybe even if you didn't learn how,
but maybe like fucking meditation.

2772
02:04:14,661 --> 02:04:16,940
If somebody carved out like we're going 
it on,

2773
02:04:16,941 --> 02:04:17,774
it's fucking amazing.
Cause were not only allowed to work out 

2774
02:04:19,431 --> 02:04:21,140
on the clock,
but we're encouraged to.

2775
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,480
That's encouraged to use a sauna.
We're encouraged,

2776
02:04:23,481 --> 02:04:24,314
we,
there's a fucking meditation room that 

2777
02:04:24,951 --> 02:04:25,784
I'll go hit and meditate for 30 minutes.
Like I'm outside with my shirt off 

2778
02:04:28,791 --> 02:04:32,030
barefoot doing Tai Chi and weird shit 
dude all the time.

2779
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:33,620
And that's okay.
Right.

2780
02:04:33,621 --> 02:04:35,810
So that culture that's created there is 
awesome.

2781
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,920
There's nap pods at Google for a fucking
reason.

2782
02:04:38,030 --> 02:04:40,800
Right?
So if you had that scheduled in to where

2783
02:04:40,801 --> 02:04:43,770
you were going to meditate every fucking
day on the clock and you knew like,

2784
02:04:43,771 --> 02:04:47,430
this is my time to rest and and just 
get,

2785
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:48,413
get silent.
I think over time you'd buy into that 

2786
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:53,670
over time.
You'd learn how or you would say,

2787
02:04:53,671 --> 02:04:56,910
I'm a fucking accountant and I came to 
this building to work,

2788
02:04:56,911 --> 02:04:57,744
not to have some fucking cult member,
asshole guru who try it was probably 

2789
02:05:01,621 --> 02:05:03,510
just trying to fuck everybody thought 
down the street.

2790
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:07,830
When I can meditate,
I meditate on my own time.

2791
02:05:07,831 --> 02:05:09,030
What the fuck?
I'm here to work.

2792
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:10,560
He said,
I need that extra 10 minutes.

2793
02:05:10,561 --> 02:05:11,394
He told me most of the people in his 
companies still have a meditation 

2794
02:05:13,141 --> 02:05:16,860
practice outside off the clock.
I would tell him that too if I wanted to

2795
02:05:16,861 --> 02:05:18,620
raise,
you know what?

2796
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:20,510
You know,
I met a tape for four hours when I'm out

2797
02:05:20,511 --> 02:05:21,301
of here,
Bro.

2798
02:05:21,301 --> 02:05:24,000
I meditate about you and how amazing an 
amazing leader you are,

2799
02:05:24,001 --> 02:05:25,460
just so,
oh my gosh.

2800
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:30,001
Yeah,
man.

2801
02:05:30,001 --> 02:05:34,290
I think it's a great idea.
I just think there's be some people that

2802
02:05:34,291 --> 02:05:34,611
would,
well,

2803
02:05:34,611 --> 02:05:36,510
I guess if you let them know before they
took the job,

2804
02:05:36,511 --> 02:05:37,950
hey man,
the only thing we requires,

2805
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:40,560
10 minutes of meditation every day.
You cool with that?

2806
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:41,370
Yeah.
I'll take it.

2807
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:42,330
But what if you,
you know,

2808
02:05:42,331 --> 02:05:45,000
like I think people,
people gravitate towards that.

2809
02:05:45,001 --> 02:05:47,730
There's likeminded individuals that 
every fucking company,

2810
02:05:47,731 --> 02:05:49,020
unless you just,
I need money.

2811
02:05:49,021 --> 02:05:51,090
And usually those people get weeded out 
of the equation.

2812
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:51,600
Right.
Well on,

2813
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,220
it's a great example of that.
When you go there,

2814
02:05:53,221 --> 02:05:58,020
everybody's super positive fit,
very friendly,

2815
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:00,570
very friendly environment.
Like there's no dickie,

2816
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:02,430
they all fucking enjoy what they're 
doing to,

2817
02:06:02,431 --> 02:06:04,530
and if they don't,
they see themselves out.

2818
02:06:04,531 --> 02:06:05,364
Yeah.
You know,

2819
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:06,750
I mean,
I think having,

2820
02:06:06,930 --> 02:06:08,520
there's no company you're ever going to 
work at.

2821
02:06:08,521 --> 02:06:09,354
We're a 100% of the people are fucking 
dialed in and they're all on the same 

2822
02:06:11,161 --> 02:06:12,810
page and know we're going to change the 
world.

2823
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:13,793
It doesn't work that way.
But if you have a high percentage that 

2824
02:06:15,211 --> 02:06:16,110
are,
that are doing that,

2825
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:17,850
that's why how you see big changes 
happen.

2826
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:19,830
Yeah.
When you get a hundred employees,

2827
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:20,933
I mean,
you're going to have a little chaos a 

2828
02:06:22,471 --> 02:06:23,304
little bit.

2829
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:26,280
You know,
you're going to have that,

2830
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:29,520
you're going to have Jewish agenda to 
mike in front of everybody.

2831
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:33,210
You're going to have that.
You're going to have craziness,

2832
02:06:33,211 --> 02:06:34,044
you know,
have people that don't work together 

2833
02:06:34,951 --> 02:06:35,784
well,
we don't like each other because of 

2834
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:40,980
preexisting biases because of who knows,
whatever the fuck it is.

2835
02:06:40,981 --> 02:06:41,814
They remind them of an X.
People are weird getting men and women 

2836
02:06:45,031 --> 02:06:48,090
to work together.
Just this to pull that off alone.

2837
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:50,610
Whew.
You know?

2838
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,220
Yeah.
We got hr now at on it.

2839
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:54,210
That's interesting.
What's that like?

2840
02:06:54,630 --> 02:06:55,463
I don't know.
I don't have a comparison because it's 

2841
02:06:57,421 --> 02:07:00,600
my first real job where I get to play an
adult.

2842
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:05,220
So you have a person who's hired to make
sure that no shenanigans take place well

2843
02:07:05,221 --> 02:07:09,290
just to create a pipeline for people to 
talk to one another or you know,

2844
02:07:09,590 --> 02:07:12,840
a pipeline where you can handle things,
um,

2845
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:14,190
in a,
in an inappropriate manner.

2846
02:07:14,190 --> 02:07:15,023
So if someone takes offense to something
and we all had to go through this 

2847
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:23,300
fucking ridiculous and Hilarious,
like 1990 video on,

2848
02:07:23,491 --> 02:07:24,300
uh,
you know,

2849
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:26,010
harassment in the workforce,
Shit like that.

2850
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:29,700
I had to watch those for a couple of 
different TV shows when you,

2851
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:30,563
when they started TV show off.
It's one of the things they do in the 

2852
02:07:32,581 --> 02:07:33,690
beginning.
They,

2853
02:07:33,691 --> 02:07:35,920
everybody has to go there and we all sat
in the bleachers.

2854
02:07:35,921 --> 02:07:37,920
Like we were there for a,
a,

2855
02:07:37,921 --> 02:07:38,754
a,
a show taping and they pull the screen 

2856
02:07:40,451 --> 02:07:43,630
down and they played us this video on 
harassment.

2857
02:07:43,631 --> 02:07:45,750
Weinstein didn't watch it.
I guess he did.

2858
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:48,730
He's just know Weinstein character in 
that video,

2859
02:07:48,731 --> 02:07:50,760
shockingly.
Tom Tata,

2860
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:51,550
right?
It is,

2861
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:52,390
yeah.
If you,

2862
02:07:52,391 --> 02:07:53,830
uh,
what does that mean?

2863
02:07:56,090 --> 02:07:56,923
I don't know if that works.
I guess maybe it works in that people 

2864
02:07:59,151 --> 02:08:00,620
know they can't get away with stuff.
Well,

2865
02:08:00,650 --> 02:08:01,221
no,
it's just,

2866
02:08:01,221 --> 02:08:03,770
it's a safe place for people to come 
talk and it doesn't mean like,

2867
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:04,371
oh,
what I mean.

2868
02:08:04,371 --> 02:08:05,240
I mean,
those videos,

2869
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:06,530
oh,
the videos don't do shit.

2870
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:07,520
They're fucking,
they work.

2871
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:09,830
They're comical.
Who's gonna like say,

2872
02:08:09,831 --> 02:08:10,664
man,
I was brought to sexually harass this 

2873
02:08:11,571 --> 02:08:13,730
chip,
but that fucking videos got me thinking.

2874
02:08:18,050 --> 02:08:18,883
Nobody would say that.
I think people bite by bite their lip a 

2875
02:08:21,111 --> 02:08:23,240
little bit though he thinks it can be 
repercussions.

2876
02:08:23,241 --> 02:08:25,340
Like you don't want to,
I want to fuck and was my job.

2877
02:08:25,370 --> 02:08:26,190
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah,

2878
02:08:26,190 --> 02:08:27,350
for sure.
I definitely don't want to lose my,

2879
02:08:27,351 --> 02:08:31,040
I wouldn't want to lose my job if it 
wasn't on it because I have a family,

2880
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:33,830
but I definitely don't want to lose this
job because it's fucking amazing.

2881
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:36,110
You know?
It's an amazing thing to be a part of.

2882
02:08:36,380 --> 02:08:39,070
I don't think that it's a,
Oh man,

2883
02:08:40,110 --> 02:08:41,060
what am I trying to say here?

2884
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:46,330
Just no room for fun with people anymore
though.

2885
02:08:46,510 --> 02:08:50,770
That's the fuck initial problem is if 
you want to cut all sexual harassment,

2886
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:53,800
which we all do.
You don't want to cut fun,

2887
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:56,260
but how do you,
you know,

2888
02:08:56,261 --> 02:08:57,094
especially like a guy who's saying 
something that he thinks is funny to a 

2889
02:09:01,841 --> 02:09:02,674
girl and it just really hurts her 
feelings and he was just trying to be 

2890
02:09:05,741 --> 02:09:07,840
funny.
Like that's in her eyes,

2891
02:09:07,841 --> 02:09:10,150
sexual harassment in his eyes.
It's a joke.

2892
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:12,400
Well it's even when everybody's eyes is 
a disaster.

2893
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:13,240
Yeah.
Any,

2894
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:14,073
and it,
it,

2895
02:09:14,350 --> 02:09:16,210
it goes into all things like,
uh,

2896
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:19,330
I fuck with Aubrey's assistant a lot.
Ian,

2897
02:09:19,450 --> 02:09:21,340
he's a good buddy of mine and I,
you know,

2898
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:23,200
I treat him like my little brother 
sometimes.

2899
02:09:23,201 --> 02:09:25,480
So,
but at this joke it is always a joke.

2900
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:26,333
Yeah.
And so we had this team meeting on the 

2901
02:09:27,311 --> 02:09:28,144
Jujitsu mats and he's sitting next to me
and the second we broke after the 

2902
02:09:30,581 --> 02:09:32,440
meeting,
I just fucking got on a leg.

2903
02:09:32,690 --> 02:09:34,120
I started cranking,
like,

2904
02:09:34,121 --> 02:09:35,830
we're on the fucking match,
pitch your mind.

2905
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:38,470
And I'm digging my knees into his Shin,
like doing some,

2906
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,393
you know,
like dirty Jujitsu and I forgot the leg 

2907
02:09:41,951 --> 02:09:44,500
I was on,
he had just fucked up in soccer.

2908
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:46,570
So he,
I mean,

2909
02:09:46,571 --> 02:09:48,070
dude's like,
he's,

2910
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:50,830
he's on fucking crutches for a minute,
you know,

2911
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:52,030
and I'm,
I'm,

2912
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:52,863
I would clown them a little bit about 
being on crutches and here comes the 

2913
02:09:55,451 --> 02:09:56,284
gimp and is my boy.
And then I realized after watching this 

2914
02:09:58,151 --> 02:09:58,570
video,
I'm like,

2915
02:09:58,570 --> 02:09:59,403
oh,
that's just as illegal as sexual 

2916
02:10:00,431 --> 02:10:01,960
harassment.
And so,

2917
02:10:01,961 --> 02:10:02,410
you know,
I'd,

2918
02:10:02,410 --> 02:10:04,030
I'd make a joke about that too.
Like,

2919
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:05,193
you know,
Ian,

2920
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:07,720
nobody's allowed to make fun of you for 
being disabled.

2921
02:10:07,721 --> 02:10:09,940
That's against the law.
And you can go to hr for that.

2922
02:10:09,941 --> 02:10:11,980
So if anybody does that,
you know,

2923
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:13,690
you can go see something,
it's okay.

2924
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,030
And that was kind of our,
you know,

2925
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:16,950
I mean,
he's five Joe,

2926
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:18,790
he's my fucking boy.
So I can do that.

2927
02:10:18,791 --> 02:10:21,100
But that's still illegal.
Yeah.

2928
02:10:21,101 --> 02:10:22,500
And that I should be saying to you right
now.

2929
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:24,550
Well see the thing is if you have good 
friends,

2930
02:10:24,910 --> 02:10:25,743
you're like,
it's what we were talking about earlier 

2931
02:10:26,471 --> 02:10:27,304
with like Comedians,
good friends say fucked up shit to each 

2932
02:10:29,381 --> 02:10:33,230
other for fun.
And it's fun for both of them because if

2933
02:10:33,231 --> 02:10:34,460
you have a real friend,

2934
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:35,623
do you love each other so much?
You know that he hasn't really think 

2935
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:41,330
terrible things about you.
But he could say funny,

2936
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:45,260
ridiculous shit like that because it'll 
make both of you laugh because you know,

2937
02:10:45,261 --> 02:10:47,450
it's not the case.
But if you thought it any way,

2938
02:10:47,451 --> 02:10:52,370
it was the case that you really were 
like mocking him in any way,

2939
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:55,520
then it would never be funny.
But because you never capable of that.

2940
02:10:55,521 --> 02:10:56,930
It's very funny.
And I don't think,

2941
02:10:56,931 --> 02:10:57,764
I think the real issue comes down to 
people who are looking to be offended 

2942
02:11:01,610 --> 02:11:02,443
that fucking terrible at telling jokes 
because people who are terrible at 

2943
02:11:06,111 --> 02:11:08,330
joking around with people and they make 
people uncomfortable.

2944
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:10,970
But there's some people in the room that
won't laugh at anything.

2945
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:11,973
You know?
It's true.

2946
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:13,490
Fucking looking for shit.
Right.

2947
02:11:13,491 --> 02:11:14,360
And there's the question,
right?

2948
02:11:14,361 --> 02:11:15,194
If you have a company like how the fuck 
do decide who to hire and not to hire 

2949
02:11:18,141 --> 02:11:20,240
because you don't know these people in 
the beginning.

2950
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:21,103
Like sometimes people are one thing and 
then they get a little power and then 

2951
02:11:24,051 --> 02:11:26,600
they become something different.
They just become a different thing.

2952
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:27,583
And then they get like ambitious or who 
knows that life changes in some way and 

2953
02:11:30,981 --> 02:11:33,020
then they get aggressive and then 
they're,

2954
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:33,891
they're different person.
Like,

2955
02:11:33,891 --> 02:11:34,724
Hey,
who are you that we hired five years 

2956
02:11:36,021 --> 02:11:37,700
ago?
Now we have to figure out a fucking exit

2957
02:11:37,701 --> 02:11:40,820
strategy to get you out of the company.
Fuck.

2958
02:11:40,850 --> 02:11:41,683
You know,
I've seen many friends go sideways on 

2959
02:11:44,451 --> 02:11:45,284
situations like that where they started 
doing business together and then the 

2960
02:11:47,631 --> 02:11:50,150
business takes off or it doesn't take 
off and whatever,

2961
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:51,093
they're,
they're stuck together and then they're 

2962
02:11:52,371 --> 02:11:55,220
not the same person who they were 10 
years ago when they started this fucking

2963
02:11:55,221 --> 02:11:56,054
thing.
So there's all this weirdness and 

2964
02:11:57,081 --> 02:11:58,850
resentment and you know,
well,

2965
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:01,390
hopefully no one's the same person they 
were 10 years ago.

2966
02:12:01,490 --> 02:12:02,323
Hopefully you fucking grow and it's a 
positive thing or it's not always the 

2967
02:12:05,301 --> 02:12:06,134
case.
Could be you growing and them not or 

2968
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:09,410
them and you not,
I mean,

2969
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:12,110
it's not uniform either.
That's the other thing.

2970
02:12:12,111 --> 02:12:13,880
It's like if you find like minded 
people,

2971
02:12:13,881 --> 02:12:18,770
the great thing about it is everyone's 
trying their best to be a good person to

2972
02:12:18,771 --> 02:12:19,970
be,
to take care of their body.

2973
02:12:19,971 --> 02:12:20,804
They're trying their best.
There's going to be some hills and 

2974
02:12:21,471 --> 02:12:23,420
valleys and ups and downs,
but for the most part,

2975
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:26,720
the thought process is about trying to 
be your best always,

2976
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:28,400
right?
If you're around those people,

2977
02:12:28,401 --> 02:12:31,610
like everybody's going to be okay.
But if you're around the people that are

2978
02:12:31,611 --> 02:12:32,444
fucking super negative about stuff and 
always sabotaging the life and always 

2979
02:12:37,101 --> 02:12:40,730
fucking up things for friends around 
them and always ruining this and fucking

2980
02:12:40,731 --> 02:12:42,560
up that,
oh,

2981
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:46,670
that can be exhausting,
that can steal your DNA,

2982
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:50,020
that steals your fucking,
the,

2983
02:12:50,070 --> 02:12:52,820
the whatever it is that makes you a 
person,

2984
02:12:53,030 --> 02:12:53,863
that feeling that you can when you're 
around someone that's just fucking up 

2985
02:12:55,761 --> 02:12:57,560
all the time where you're like,
oh,

2986
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:59,750
it's exhausting.

2987
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:01,670
It's kind of the deal to where he just,
you know,

2988
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:05,060
if it is family or somebody care about,
just love them at a distance.

2989
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:06,920
You know,
you've got to remove yourself from that.

2990
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:07,903
You can't get wrapped up this,
there are certain family members that 

2991
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:12,680
they go crazy and you can't get wrapped 
up.

2992
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:14,210
They'll,
they'll take you down,

2993
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:17,060
they'll take you down with them.
You can't live two lives simultaneously.

2994
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:19,850
You do your best if people want to go 
crazy.

2995
02:13:19,851 --> 02:13:24,851
And that's always been my,
my real fear and concern that when,

2996
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:26,473
um,
someone that I know well does the drug 

2997
02:13:28,611 --> 02:13:31,100
thing goes down the drug,
the drug hole,

2998
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:31,980
the wall,

2999
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:32,813
you know,
like you see like something like what 

3000
02:13:33,511 --> 02:13:35,490
are you doing man?
Are you doing [inaudible] and Tao?

3001
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:36,540
No,
I'm not doing nothing.

3002
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:38,140
And you're like,
oh no,

3003
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:40,050
we got,
we got a tweaker over here.

3004
02:13:40,230 --> 02:13:42,120
We lost a homeboy.
He's tweaking.

3005
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:43,350
He's,
he's not even himself.

3006
02:13:43,351 --> 02:13:45,690
And then when I was going to lie to us 
about whether or not he's taken math,

3007
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:49,800
yeah,
I've seen shit like that in college.

3008
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:52,920
Lost a friend of heroin a while,
lost two friends to heroin,

3009
02:13:52,921 --> 02:13:56,910
gain one back and he got fucking clean.
It's not fun.

3010
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:57,893
That's the rough one.
To witness people that are willing to 

3011
02:13:59,611 --> 02:14:02,760
stick a needle in their arm right into 
the vein.

3012
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:06,173
There's the romantic thing about it to 
some people that this is the ultimate 

3013
02:14:09,061 --> 02:14:11,640
fuck you to safety.
You know the,

3014
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:12,593
the fuck you to the standard norms the 
society's put on you and you stick that 

3015
02:14:17,851 --> 02:14:19,920
needle in you and just,
ah,

3016
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:25,770
untie that strap fucking crazy.
What a crazy thing to do.

3017
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,830
Ari Shaffir had a good point on that 
though.

3018
02:14:28,831 --> 02:14:31,440
He was looking at a,
I forget what he was talking about it,

3019
02:14:31,441 --> 02:14:32,274
but he said he saw a homeless man and he
realized the guy was on some fucked up 

3020
02:14:35,431 --> 02:14:36,750
drugs and he was like,
oh,

3021
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:38,333
I get it.
You were just introduced to the wrong 

3022
02:14:39,961 --> 02:14:40,794
drugs is already does a lot of drugs,
but he has drugs that help elevate him 

3023
02:14:45,301 --> 02:14:46,134
and lift him to a new spot and give them
new perspective and hope and joy and 

3024
02:14:49,651 --> 02:14:50,484
this other guy just got fucking suck 
deep down the rabbit hole in the wrong 

3025
02:14:53,311 --> 02:14:54,144
direction.

3026
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:56,460
Wow.
Yeah.

3027
02:14:57,030 --> 02:14:57,863
I think in some ways that's true,
but in some ways they liked the heroin 

3028
02:15:00,691 --> 02:15:02,430
better.
You know?

3029
02:15:02,431 --> 02:15:05,640
Who was it that had that statement about
heroin?

3030
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:06,533
There was,
there was a,

3031
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:07,913
I'm not going to remember it,
but there was a fascinating statement 

3032
02:15:10,591 --> 02:15:14,670
about heroin killing you that what the,
when it was killing you,

3033
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:17,670
you,
I think it was lenny bruce talking about

3034
02:15:17,671 --> 02:15:19,440
it,
but that it was,

3035
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:24,500
it was such a sweet death.
I really forget the quote because heroin

3036
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:27,420
is something I,
it freaks me out so much.

3037
02:15:27,421 --> 02:15:29,010
I don't even like reading too much about
it.

3038
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:32,460
I like read a few things here or about 
people that are hooked on it.

3039
02:15:32,461 --> 02:15:34,440
It just,
it creeps me out so much.

3040
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:35,293
It's,
it's almost like I'm reading about 

3041
02:15:35,821 --> 02:15:38,790
demonic possession and in a way I think 
it is and the way,

3042
02:15:38,791 --> 02:15:41,340
I think when people lose their entire 
life to some pills,

3043
02:15:41,341 --> 02:15:42,120
they can't stop.

3044
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:44,700
They lose their family and lose their 
job and they just can't stop.

3045
02:15:44,701 --> 02:15:45,534
They keep taking it.
How is that really any different in 

3046
02:15:48,391 --> 02:15:49,224
terms of the overall results and the 
effect it has on your loved ones and 

3047
02:15:53,101 --> 02:15:55,170
your friends and your family and 
yourself?

3048
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:56,093
How's that?
Any different than just a really evil 

3049
02:15:57,631 --> 02:15:58,464
demon that t talks you into staying home
all day and makes you throw up and it's 

3050
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:04,290
just fucking with you all day and making
you tired.

3051
02:16:04,291 --> 02:16:07,020
Just dragging you to the ground,
making you fall asleep right in front of

3052
02:16:07,021 --> 02:16:08,370
the sink.
How was any,

3053
02:16:08,371 --> 02:16:10,020
if there was a demon doing that,
you're like,

3054
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:11,010
oh my God,
look at him.

3055
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:15,720
He's possessed by a demon.
It'd be horrible if we just saw some kid

3056
02:16:15,721 --> 02:16:16,650
who was just his,
his,

3057
02:16:16,651 --> 02:16:19,890
his body's all fucked up cause he's a 
demon inside of them controlling it.

3058
02:16:20,190 --> 02:16:21,210
But instead we're like,
oh no,

3059
02:16:21,211 --> 02:16:23,850
he's all fucked up cause he shot up.
He shot up.

3060
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,713
Well,
they'll,

3061
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,820
it's the same thing.
Yeah.

3062
02:16:26,821 --> 02:16:29,290
It grabs people.
That's the fucking problem though,

3063
02:16:29,291 --> 02:16:30,940
is that you look at that.
That's it.

3064
02:16:31,210 --> 02:16:33,190
I'll die young,
but it's like kissing God.

3065
02:16:33,850 --> 02:16:34,683
That was his expression of it.
And who died of a morphine overdose on 

3066
02:16:38,201 --> 02:16:40,120
August 3rd,
1966,

3067
02:16:41,470 --> 02:16:42,303
man.

3068
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:47,090
Ooh.
He's,

3069
02:16:47,091 --> 02:16:50,420
um,
from in my line of work,

3070
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:51,440
that's the,
that's the,

3071
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:53,630
that's,
that's the Lucy,

3072
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:57,430
you know,
that primordial or whatever would it,

3073
02:16:57,470 --> 02:17:01,250
how would you recall a prehistoric human
human owned hominoid?

3074
02:17:01,850 --> 02:17:02,683
What was Lucy that was that I remember 
when they discovered pithy kiss or 

3075
02:17:05,751 --> 02:17:07,100
something like that.
Yeah.

3076
02:17:07,400 --> 02:17:09,770
That's what Lenny Bruce is.
And a lot second you said Lucy.

3077
02:17:09,771 --> 02:17:11,180
I was thinking to Lsd,
but,

3078
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:12,590
oh,
I know what you're talking about.

3079
02:17:12,591 --> 02:17:13,550
LSD.
They are,

3080
02:17:13,551 --> 02:17:15,920
uh,
lucy was on the cover of Nat Geo,

3081
02:17:15,921 --> 02:17:16,400
right?
Yeah.

3082
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:17,233
It was like one of the first,
like early human skeletons that they 

3083
02:17:21,711 --> 02:17:22,544
had.
I think there's some controversy 

3084
02:17:22,911 --> 02:17:23,744
attached to that thing too,
which there always is to those ancient 

3085
02:17:27,291 --> 02:17:28,650
humans that they find,
you know,

3086
02:17:28,651 --> 02:17:30,980
you find a fucking human from.
How long ago was Lucy?

3087
02:17:31,340 --> 02:17:32,930
How many?
2 million.

3088
02:17:32,931 --> 02:17:34,640
2.92
point 9 million.

3089
02:17:34,910 --> 02:17:38,300
Let me see a picture that was us just 
2.9

3090
02:17:38,301 --> 02:17:42,170
million years ago.
What the fuck?

3091
02:17:43,630 --> 02:17:44,530
That's crazy.

3092
02:17:46,690 --> 02:17:50,530
Would you fuck lucy if I had to for the 
good of the human race,

3093
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:54,940
if we need to make people who was asking
if they would fucking Neanderthal,

3094
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:56,473
uh,
was,

3095
02:17:56,510 --> 02:17:57,910
uh,
who was it you,

3096
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:01,270
the answer is yes.
The answer's fucking yes.

3097
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:02,133
It happened.
What I mean when it's functioning and 

3098
02:18:03,251 --> 02:18:04,084
it's all,
what I mean by Lenny Bruce was this is 

3099
02:18:05,111 --> 02:18:06,340
like,
he's the first,

3100
02:18:06,730 --> 02:18:09,670
he's not like primitive.
I mean he was like super advanced,

3101
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:12,130
but he was the very first version of 
that.

3102
02:18:12,370 --> 02:18:15,490
The very first version of a real standup
comedian like that.

3103
02:18:15,491 --> 02:18:18,430
Everybody,
all lines come from Lenny Bruce.

3104
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:19,293
I mean,
there's a bunch of his contemporaries 

3105
02:18:19,991 --> 02:18:20,824
that were really good too.
And there's a bunch of people from that 

3106
02:18:22,241 --> 02:18:26,380
era that we're just all innovative and 
interesting thinkers in the all I'm sure

3107
02:18:26,381 --> 02:18:29,320
fed off of each other.
But Lenny Bruce is almost like Lucy.

3108
02:18:29,410 --> 02:18:30,640
She's like,
he's almost like the first,

3109
02:18:30,641 --> 02:18:33,550
I'll try it.
He's like the first real standup comic,

3110
02:18:33,910 --> 02:18:34,721
you know,
like we'd say,

3111
02:18:34,721 --> 02:18:35,201
look,
okay,

3112
02:18:35,201 --> 02:18:36,034
I get Mark Twain was doing it.
I understand that all these different 

3113
02:18:37,991 --> 02:18:42,991
people had like a kind of comical way of
talking in front of people.

3114
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:44,103
But there was something about the way he
was analyzing and breaking down society 

3115
02:18:46,451 --> 02:18:47,510
on stage.
That was,

3116
02:18:47,590 --> 02:18:50,470
this was the first of those.
So you watch that and go,

3117
02:18:50,471 --> 02:18:51,550
wow,
that's um,

3118
02:18:52,300 --> 02:18:53,970
that's like some,
it's like a,

3119
02:18:53,990 --> 02:18:56,290
almost like a scientific discovery.
It's like,

3120
02:18:56,291 --> 02:18:57,124
well this is now,
this is going to shift the culture this 

3121
02:18:59,231 --> 02:19:02,260
way because now people are going to be 
mocking things for free entertainment.

3122
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:03,213
So the,
the other side's going to get way more 

3123
02:19:04,151 --> 02:19:04,984
mocking.
So you're going to have your serious 

3124
02:19:05,861 --> 02:19:06,790
side,
but there's going to be,

3125
02:19:06,791 --> 02:19:09,640
is a business and making fun of it.
Now there's a new thing,

3126
02:19:09,641 --> 02:19:10,474
now this is a new thing.
And that's what that guy was just kind 

3127
02:19:13,691 --> 02:19:16,960
of a trip and you really stop and think 
about how influential one person can be.

3128
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:18,153
You know that one person with some crazy
amount of talents and weird way of 

3129
02:19:21,821 --> 02:19:26,821
looking at things can shift like all 
across from right now.

3130
02:19:28,140 --> 02:19:29,270
This,
this guy right here,

3131
02:19:29,271 --> 02:19:31,260
man,
he was a,

3132
02:19:31,340 --> 02:19:33,170
he was doing things,
play some of this man.

3133
02:19:33,860 --> 02:19:34,693
I got it.
I'm going to get a whole bunch of new 

3134
02:19:37,090 --> 02:19:39,200
suit.
Dumb,

3135
02:19:39,201 --> 02:19:42,490
stupid tenure.
You're welcome her closet.

3136
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:47,500
You can't even breathe.
I get a kick that like the hang out man.

3137
02:19:49,070 --> 02:19:49,810
I'll get it.
Okay.

3138
02:19:49,810 --> 02:19:51,810
Love Vodka Party.
That's monopod.

3139
02:19:51,811 --> 02:19:53,560
Chapati swing it up all up.
I get it.

3140
02:19:53,750 --> 02:19:57,980
I got a chicken like to drink when my 
wife,

3141
02:19:57,981 --> 02:20:00,770
she'll use to look good standing up 
against this thing.

3142
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:06,860
She had the lowest though.
I really put her down.

3143
02:20:06,861 --> 02:20:08,300
No,
no.

3144
02:20:08,301 --> 02:20:09,134
I really miss her.
I don't want them shot chick that can 

3145
02:20:11,841 --> 02:20:14,300
coat carol.
Act and walk with boys.

3146
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:19,070
I just want to hear my lady say get up 
and fix the thing.

3147
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:24,760
It still making noise all alone.
All alone.

3148
02:20:28,410 --> 02:20:30,550
Like on their side.
The dog.

3149
02:20:30,551 --> 02:20:31,384
What has the bone all but it's better.
Can they all alone no more taking out 

3150
02:20:38,081 --> 02:20:40,390
the garbage here.
Her on the phone.

3151
02:20:40,391 --> 02:20:44,440
I gave her everything,
even my mother's ring,

3152
02:20:45,460 --> 02:20:50,050
but to me she was so pulling some times 
I wished that she worked at,

3153
02:20:50,890 --> 02:20:52,960
but it probably take her two hours to 
get ready.

3154
02:20:56,610 --> 02:20:57,443
What the fuck this is probably like,
I would have to guess like 1960 what 

3155
02:21:01,651 --> 02:21:04,110
year was that?
Did say?

3156
02:21:05,330 --> 02:21:07,560
Hmm.
Wonder when that was.

3157
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:10,620
It's gotta be somewhere in that 
neighborhood.

3158
02:21:11,370 --> 02:21:15,450
But that guy and big heroin problem,
man,

3159
02:21:15,550 --> 02:21:16,020
big,
big,

3160
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:17,580
big,
big heroin problem.

3161
02:21:17,910 --> 02:21:20,310
And he was also fighting against 
censorship.

3162
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:21,173
He was like one of the first people that
was a public speaker that was 

3163
02:21:24,181 --> 02:21:26,790
challenging.
The idea is a censorship in court.

3164
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:27,713
He was getting arrested for doing this 
nightclub performances and saying 

3165
02:21:30,091 --> 02:21:32,400
certain words,
you know,

3166
02:21:32,401 --> 02:21:33,234
and he was talking about how ridiculous 
it is to put all the power in these 

3167
02:21:36,301 --> 02:21:37,860
words,
including racist words.

3168
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:40,770
Nobody was doing anything like this back
then.

3169
02:21:40,771 --> 02:21:44,250
It was crazy shit.
And a lot of what he was doing,

3170
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:45,390
um,
to me,

3171
02:21:45,391 --> 02:21:46,110
you know,
sanity.

3172
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:46,943
Yeah.
A lot of what he was doing was he was a 

3173
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:54,930
big believer and expanding his 
consciousness.

3174
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:56,750
He was getting fucked up a lot.
He's,

3175
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:57,713
you know,
he's doing obviously doing heroin 

3176
02:21:59,671 --> 02:22:01,740
because he died of it,
talked about it pretty openly,

3177
02:22:02,370 --> 02:22:03,203
but who knows what else he was doing to,
I think marijuana was involved in there 

3178
02:22:05,161 --> 02:22:07,710
too.
He's expanding his mind and it's strange

3179
02:22:07,711 --> 02:22:10,320
time.
I think it's impossible for us to really

3180
02:22:10,830 --> 02:22:15,830
put ourselves in the mindset of people 
who lived in the 1950s in 19 early 1960s

3181
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:17,153
I think.
I don't even think we're capable of 

3182
02:22:17,671 --> 02:22:20,400
doing it now.
We have like a vh one depiction of that.

3183
02:22:20,401 --> 02:22:22,860
Did you ever see the the decades?
Yeah.

3184
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:26,250
Where they had been through the sixties 
the seventies eighties and nineties that

3185
02:22:26,251 --> 02:22:27,084
was pretty fucking Rad,
but that's still a Hollywood version of 

3186
02:22:29,401 --> 02:22:30,750
it.
100% you know,

3187
02:22:31,530 --> 02:22:35,130
even when they get to the eighties you 
know like go canes are surgeons and it's

3188
02:22:35,131 --> 02:22:35,964
all fucking Madonna and prince and it's 
so silly back to the future and shit 

3189
02:22:39,121 --> 02:22:39,900
like that.

3190
02:22:39,900 --> 02:22:42,450
I don't think we can imagine what it 
would have been like growing up then.

3191
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,880
You know,
living in his era,

3192
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:50,090
like people were so buttoned down to 
have some guy come along and go,

3193
02:22:50,851 --> 02:22:53,040
why,
why are we doing it like this now?

3194
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:53,910
He was,
um,

3195
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:59,310
that's a crazy thing that standup comedy
started in America.

3196
02:22:59,620 --> 02:23:02,490
It really did.
I mean there was definitely gestures and

3197
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:03,713
you know,
King Arthur's days and all that 

3198
02:23:05,551 --> 02:23:06,384
bullshit.
And from the beginning of time people 

3199
02:23:08,071 --> 02:23:08,904
have had court jesters and there's 
always been funny people in the village 

3200
02:23:11,281 --> 02:23:12,114
that everybody gathered round like a 
Joey Diaz type character that lives 

3201
02:23:14,851 --> 02:23:16,760
somewhere.
But this,

3202
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:19,590
the art of stand up comedy,
like that was the first,

3203
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:20,513
and I,
I think,

3204
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:22,590
I mean maybe I'm wrong,
maybe it's Mark Twain,

3205
02:23:22,591 --> 02:23:24,360
but if it's not,
it's not mark Twain,

3206
02:23:24,390 --> 02:23:25,710
Tim,
you know,

3207
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:30,960
that was the first one where people 
started wanting to be that and then they

3208
02:23:30,961 --> 02:23:31,794
kind of like,
there was a lot of that coming off of 

3209
02:23:32,611 --> 02:23:33,490
that,
you know,

3210
02:23:33,491 --> 02:23:34,324
like these,
these little branches get taken off the 

3211
02:23:36,451 --> 02:23:39,660
main river and culture occasionally,
you know,

3212
02:23:39,661 --> 02:23:40,494
and I think a lot of that was what I was
reading in the Malcolm Gladwell book 

3213
02:23:43,981 --> 02:23:46,020
that was talking about earlier,
that was the tipping point,

3214
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:46,913
tipping point.

3215
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:49,000
It's about different trends,
like real,

3216
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:50,700
real specific stuff.
Like what,

3217
02:23:50,730 --> 02:23:51,563
what caused this a uptick and um,
syphilis in one part of the country and 

3218
02:23:58,351 --> 02:24:00,120
like what caught,
like what are these,

3219
02:24:00,121 --> 02:24:00,954
all these factors that fall in place 
that all work synergistically and push 

3220
02:24:05,611 --> 02:24:06,444
something over the top.
How did hush puppies go from a business 

3221
02:24:08,191 --> 02:24:11,790
that was like almost bankrupt to being 
something that will like everywhere.

3222
02:24:11,791 --> 02:24:12,624
And then there's,
in two years they had stores opened in 

3223
02:24:14,041 --> 02:24:16,620
every mall and they were closed.
I mean,

3224
02:24:16,621 --> 02:24:18,420
they were um,
open,

3225
02:24:18,750 --> 02:24:21,450
uh,
for decades without this kind of success

3226
02:24:21,590 --> 02:24:22,423
and something happened and they became 
this hip thing to have hush puppies on 

3227
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:26,723
and then boom,
the business just explodes out of 

3228
02:24:27,661 --> 02:24:28,494
nowhere.
And did these weird moments like that 

3229
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,050
sometimes like an elan musk type 
character,

3230
02:24:32,051 --> 02:24:34,140
it comes along and just,
Oh,

3231
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:36,600
I want to fucking put people on Mars.
I want to make an electric car,

3232
02:24:36,601 --> 02:24:38,610
I want to puck shoot tunnels under the 
ground.

3233
02:24:38,611 --> 02:24:39,444
Like one of these characters comes along
and then through them there's like this 

3234
02:24:42,451 --> 02:24:45,540
new river and all this new crazy shit 
happens.

3235
02:24:46,050 --> 02:24:47,320
That guy was,
that was,

3236
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:48,233
that guy was probably the,
the number one for standup comedy for 

3237
02:24:50,131 --> 02:24:50,964
that

3238
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:53,600
fucking massive,
yeah.

3239
02:24:53,601 --> 02:24:56,570
Pretty crazy shit dude.
You ever see,

3240
02:24:56,571 --> 02:24:58,580
uh,
what was the name of it?

3241
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:01,790
This is the touring,
the turing test.

3242
02:25:01,791 --> 02:25:02,624
The Turing Turing test is a,
whether or not you could tell if 

3243
02:25:04,611 --> 02:25:06,500
artificial intelligence is human.
Yeah.

3244
02:25:06,501 --> 02:25:07,334
It's not the turing test.
It's the movie about the guy who 

3245
02:25:08,751 --> 02:25:10,220
invented the computer.
Turing.

3246
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:12,740
Oh,
the British dude.

3247
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:15,673
Okay.

3248
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:17,100
Um,
oh wait,

3249
02:25:17,101 --> 02:25:19,560
are you talking about x mocking or like 
the one about it?

3250
02:25:19,561 --> 02:25:21,990
Like the imitation game or something 
like the invitation game?

3251
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:24,010
Yeah.
It's fucking

3252
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:26,830
nuts to think like if you look,
if you watched that movie and obviously,

3253
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:27,910
have you seen it?
No,

3254
02:25:28,090 --> 02:25:30,310
it's the imitation.
It's awesome.

3255
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:32,850
That guy's a great,
a great fucking actor too.

3256
02:25:32,860 --> 02:25:35,410
I'm right in the show right now.
It's Dr Strange,

3257
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:37,780
benedict cumberbatch.
He's a savage,

3258
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:40,390
but they go through that in that time 
period.

3259
02:25:41,350 --> 02:25:43,540
He fucking invented the fucking 
computer,

3260
02:25:43,810 --> 02:25:45,430
you know?
And then he goes through the time period

3261
02:25:45,431 --> 02:25:46,264
and he's gay in Britain and they put 
them on medication that lowers his 

3262
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:53,590
testosterone so he won't be gay,
so they won't have sex with men.

3263
02:25:53,591 --> 02:25:56,290
It's fucking insane.
That's a hilarious toby.

3264
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:58,870
But if you think about like people who 
move the fucking needle,

3265
02:25:58,871 --> 02:26:00,740
right?
Like people that change shift,

3266
02:26:00,750 --> 02:26:01,583
like if that's where it comes from 
computers and then we get to fucking 

3267
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,670
hyper-intelligent superintelligent ai.
It all started there.

3268
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:10,890
That is crazy

3269
02:26:10,890 --> 02:26:11,641
one.
Well,

3270
02:26:11,641 --> 02:26:14,010
there was a bunch of different factions,
right?

3271
02:26:14,011 --> 02:26:14,844
Bunch of different people that were 
working on computers because a woman 

3272
02:26:16,531 --> 02:26:18,730
created the very first computer code.
Hmm.

3273
02:26:19,210 --> 02:26:20,440
Yeah.
I forget what her name was.

3274
02:26:20,470 --> 02:26:21,220
Well,
there's two.

3275
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:24,880
There's two pivotal inventions by women 
in,

3276
02:26:24,881 --> 02:26:28,450
uh,
in computer design and then ultimately,

3277
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:33,520
and in the actual execution of it,
here it is Ada lovelace.

3278
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:38,140
It's been called the world's first 
computer programmer.

3279
02:26:38,590 --> 02:26:42,850
What she did was write the world's first
machine algorithm for an early computing

3280
02:26:42,851 --> 02:26:45,580
machine that existed only on paper.
Of course,

3281
02:26:45,581 --> 02:26:48,340
someone had to be the first,
but lovelace was a woman and this was in

3282
02:26:48,341 --> 02:26:53,341
the 1840s.
So suck it stupid people sock.

3283
02:26:54,841 --> 02:26:56,200
Yeah.
Ada.

3284
02:26:56,380 --> 02:27:00,280
Ada was rocking shit in the 18 hundreds.
She's figuring it out.

3285
02:27:00,580 --> 02:27:01,840
Imagine you've,
you'd be like,

3286
02:27:01,841 --> 02:27:02,674
look,
one day they're gonna be able to do 

3287
02:27:03,161 --> 02:27:03,994
this,
but right now they don't want to do it 

3288
02:27:04,590 --> 02:27:06,610
if one day,
if they just figured out how to do this,

3289
02:27:06,611 --> 02:27:07,444
this is this and there's an that and 
we're going to have computers and the 

3290
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:12,010
computers will operate on this algorithm
and people are looking at you like,

3291
02:27:12,011 --> 02:27:13,840
pitch,
what the fuck are you talking about?

3292
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:18,310
Computers like imagined how,
what a hell it would be to be a super,

3293
02:27:18,311 --> 02:27:20,440
super genius living amongst the cave 
people.

3294
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:22,150
You're like,
you fucks,

3295
02:27:22,151 --> 02:27:25,060
we could be flying around if you 
assholes knew how to melt aluminum.

3296
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:28,750
Can you guys get me some glass?
You don't know glass shit.

3297
02:27:28,870 --> 02:27:30,550
Do you have any wires?
You have no wire.

3298
02:27:30,610 --> 02:27:33,220
Okay.
Where do you get your metal?

3299
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:34,653
You don't have metal.
What shit you imagine if you like we're 

3300
02:27:38,831 --> 02:27:39,664
looking at metal in the ground.
Like why don't they just pull the metal 

3301
02:27:41,081 --> 02:27:41,914
out and make things out of that?
And then I'll look around and you're 

3302
02:27:44,381 --> 02:27:45,214
like,
what's the point?

3303
02:27:45,310 --> 02:27:47,230
What's the point in making a house?
What's the point?

3304
02:27:47,231 --> 02:27:48,064
What's the point in having glass windows
that look out at these cave people 

3305
02:27:51,401 --> 02:27:55,510
fucking each other and stab and 
mastodons and the deck with flint tips.

3306
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:57,850
Tools.
Fuck.

3307
02:27:58,300 --> 02:27:59,133
Imagine what the hell that would be.
That would be like the worst thing you 

3308
02:28:00,911 --> 02:28:02,170
could do to somebody.
Like,

3309
02:28:02,171 --> 02:28:05,280
imagine if one day they come up with a 
time machine and uh,

3310
02:28:05,290 --> 02:28:06,123
one of the punishments for people that 
were real pieces of shit as you throw 

3311
02:28:09,881 --> 02:28:14,860
them in front of Gingiss cons horde in 
like 1200 a day,

3312
02:28:15,160 --> 02:28:18,250
you would just like take your underwear,
you're in your underwear,

3313
02:28:18,251 --> 02:28:19,084
everybody knows it's going to happen.
You have a chance to live if you just 

3314
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:22,130
might get lucky

3315
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,963
and like teleport to the right spot and 
not get slaughtered and eaten by the 

3316
02:28:26,931 --> 02:28:28,700
Mongols as they come over the top of the
hill.

3317
02:28:28,701 --> 02:28:31,130
But we're going to put you right in 
front of them and you know,

3318
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:34,880
good luck you piece of shit.
Fucking transport transportive at a time

3319
02:28:34,881 --> 02:28:36,320
machine.
I mean,

3320
02:28:36,321 --> 02:28:40,220
if they do come up with what the ability
to do that to people one day,

3321
02:28:41,210 --> 02:28:44,750
like an actual time machine,
that would be the biggest hell ever.

3322
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:45,643
Take a person from 2018 who's used to 
drive it around in his tesla and 

3323
02:28:49,401 --> 02:28:51,470
checking his text every five minutes and
no,

3324
02:28:51,471 --> 02:28:53,420
you were going to let you live.
We're going to let you live,

3325
02:28:53,421 --> 02:28:57,230
but you're gonna live in 1200 a day.
No doctors,

3326
02:28:57,260 --> 02:28:59,750
no doctors.
What the fuck is a doctor?

3327
02:28:59,810 --> 02:29:01,010
What are you talking about,
man?

3328
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:02,570
You gotta run,
you gotta run.

3329
02:29:02,571 --> 02:29:03,620
They're coming over the hill.

3330
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:04,970
You know you smell that.
Yeah,

3331
02:29:04,971 --> 02:29:08,180
that's people burning.
You smell people burning like candles.

3332
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:11,960
Ron Just fucking run.
But you're alive.

3333
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:14,240
That was the punishment.
Yeah,

3334
02:29:14,241 --> 02:29:17,780
that'd be fine.
Now that would be crazy manage.

3335
02:29:17,781 --> 02:29:20,630
If somebody raped you and you get to 
decide what year they come back,

3336
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:22,690
where they have to go,
yeah,

3337
02:29:22,710 --> 02:29:25,280
we'll just send this motherfucker back 
to the dinosaur era.

3338
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:26,450
Good luck.
You can't,

3339
02:29:27,590 --> 02:29:28,490
and then they,
they're,

3340
02:29:28,491 --> 02:29:29,324
they're,
they're going to be by themselves 65 

3341
02:29:32,990 --> 02:29:35,000
million years ago.
How many people would say yes to that?

3342
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:36,710
Like how many people said yes.
Well,

3343
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:41,000
we could do one thing.
Bernie madoff.

3344
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:42,073
We can either put you in jail for the 
rest of your life or you get freedom in 

3345
02:29:47,571 --> 02:29:50,270
prehistoric,
Central Asia.

3346
02:29:50,570 --> 02:29:51,403
What would you do?
I'd take the death by prehistoric 

3347
02:29:53,661 --> 02:29:56,060
Central Asia all day.
You got to fucking live.

3348
02:29:56,090 --> 02:29:58,190
Oh Day.
Throw me in Siberia.

3349
02:29:58,191 --> 02:29:59,660
I cite die there,
I die there,

3350
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:00,733
but at least I'm not in a fucking cage 
until my heart stops beating a hundred 

3351
02:30:03,770 --> 02:30:04,940
percent I'd take that all day.

3352
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:06,530
I'll roll the dice,
I'll roll the dice,

3353
02:30:06,531 --> 02:30:07,880
it'll suck.
I'll die for sure,

3354
02:30:08,030 --> 02:30:12,140
but I'll dive running or trying to get 
away or you know,

3355
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:13,813
break a leg.
You know I'm not going to die in that 

3356
02:30:15,261 --> 02:30:18,800
box.
That's the craziest thing about you,

3357
02:30:18,801 --> 02:30:22,190
don't you?
You just decide when someone has crossed

3358
02:30:22,191 --> 02:30:23,024
some line that you're were going to take
you out of circulation and we're just 

3359
02:30:26,511 --> 02:30:27,344
going to cool you in this little cage 
and we're going to hope you get better 

3360
02:30:29,511 --> 02:30:34,190
when we let you out in 15 years.
Like what a stupid idea.

3361
02:30:34,191 --> 02:30:36,620
It's not working.
That's how you know it's a stupid idea.

3362
02:30:37,130 --> 02:30:39,200
It's not.
It's not working for anyone.

3363
02:30:39,320 --> 02:30:42,830
You want to protect people from violent 
offenders.

3364
02:30:42,950 --> 02:30:44,510
That's primary,
right?

3365
02:30:44,990 --> 02:30:45,823
Violent offenders,
people who want to rob people or murder 

3366
02:30:50,241 --> 02:30:52,820
people are raped.
People are assault people.

3367
02:30:52,821 --> 02:30:55,380
That is the number one thing is we want 
everybody,

3368
02:30:55,490 --> 02:30:57,770
everybody to be safe.
I love Jamie.

3369
02:30:57,771 --> 02:30:58,604
I don't want Jamie to have to worry when
he walks down the street that this guy 

3370
02:31:00,831 --> 02:31:01,664
that they locked up 10 times going to 
jump out of the bushes and take his 

3371
02:31:03,921 --> 02:31:07,190
knees out with a baseball bat for no 
fucking reason other than he's crazy,

3372
02:31:07,250 --> 02:31:08,090
right?
You don't want that.

3373
02:31:08,091 --> 02:31:08,924
Nobody wants that.
So we all agree you got to lock up 

3374
02:31:12,261 --> 02:31:14,510
rapists and murderers and all that.
But after that,

3375
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:16,730
after get to,
after you get past that,

3376
02:31:16,731 --> 02:31:17,960
it's like,
hmm,

3377
02:31:18,470 --> 02:31:20,040
what?
What does it do

3378
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:21,990
to get that guy that cheated on his 
taxes?

3379
02:31:21,991 --> 02:31:23,760
Why do you put them in a cage for a 
year?

3380
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:26,310
Why don't you let them work and pay you 
back?

3381
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:28,530
Like why is he in a cage for a year?
That seems,

3382
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:30,990
that seems like you're punishing them.
Like you're,

3383
02:31:30,991 --> 02:31:31,824
you're,
you're just trying to torture him and 

3384
02:31:32,641 --> 02:31:35,220
steal a year of his life,
but he'll just owes you money.

3385
02:31:35,221 --> 02:31:37,830
He doesn't know you a year of his life.
How much does a year of your life worth?

3386
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:40,950
It's worth fucking billions of dollars a
year.

3387
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,380
Your Life.
Fuck you man.

3388
02:31:43,381 --> 02:31:45,720
You can't take a year or someone's life.
That's crazy.

3389
02:31:46,470 --> 02:31:48,550
But if you owe taxes,
like,

3390
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:49,800
oh,
I'd like a year of your life,

3391
02:31:49,801 --> 02:31:52,110
sir.
Or if you're fucking selling plants,

3392
02:31:52,140 --> 02:31:52,973
sell implants or worse,
you're one of those people that didn't 

3393
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:58,710
send the envelope and trying to bring 
someone that 4,000

3394
02:31:58,711 --> 02:31:59,544
pounds of cocaine over,
what would be a good deterrent for come 

3395
02:32:03,391 --> 02:32:04,260
from parts of stops?

3396
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:05,093
I don't think there's,
I think education is that the real 

3397
02:32:07,111 --> 02:32:09,480
determined you have to catch them and 
there has to be punishment.

3398
02:32:09,810 --> 02:32:12,240
Like if you owe people money,
there should be reparations.

3399
02:32:12,270 --> 02:32:13,260
You should,
like if you,

3400
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:16,800
if you were involved in some sort of a 
banking scheme and you rip people off,

3401
02:32:16,801 --> 02:32:18,180
you should have to pay those people 
back.

3402
02:32:18,181 --> 02:32:19,050
Period.
You should have,

3403
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:21,570
you should be responsible for that after
that,

3404
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:23,113
um,
you're assuming that someone's capable 

3405
02:32:24,811 --> 02:32:26,970
of growing and sometimes we don't like 
to do that.

3406
02:32:26,971 --> 02:32:30,000
It's very convenient to assume that 
someone is in a static state and they're

3407
02:32:30,001 --> 02:32:31,150
never going to grow.
Oh,

3408
02:32:31,151 --> 02:32:31,984
this old banker asshole,
he's just a ritual cut and this is how 

3409
02:32:34,531 --> 02:32:35,880
he's going to die.
Fuck him.

3410
02:32:36,030 --> 02:32:37,020
There's,
there's that thing,

3411
02:32:37,021 --> 02:32:40,440
but he's a human being.
And even if he lived his life,

3412
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:42,540
fucking people over on those,
uh,

3413
02:32:42,570 --> 02:32:43,403
you know,
those weird mortgage situation loans 

3414
02:32:45,721 --> 02:32:46,554
that were going on.

3415
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:48,390
What were those things called?
Those,

3416
02:32:48,391 --> 02:32:50,100
um,
the adjustable arm.

3417
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:52,800
Yeah,
the adjustable mortgages that people got

3418
02:32:52,801 --> 02:32:53,634
fucked on because they signed up for 
them and they were really low rate and 

3419
02:32:56,161 --> 02:32:56,994
then also in their rate jacked up 
through the roof and they were just 

3420
02:32:58,291 --> 02:32:59,124
inevitably going to lose their house.
And this was like something that people 

3421
02:33:01,111 --> 02:33:01,944
knew about it before.
And even the people that organize that 

3422
02:33:03,031 --> 02:33:05,430
kind of Shit,
even knowing they can grow,

3423
02:33:05,820 --> 02:33:06,653
it's a horrible thing they did,
but they used to say that they're done 

3424
02:33:09,510 --> 02:33:10,800
fucked damn.
Lock them up forever.

3425
02:33:10,801 --> 02:33:14,430
My grandma lost her house.
It's terrible that your grandma lost her

3426
02:33:14,431 --> 02:33:17,820
house and whoever the fuck benefited 
from your grandma losing the house,

3427
02:33:17,821 --> 02:33:19,330
they should all have to give that money 
back to,

3428
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:20,233
we should figure out the fuck.
How the fuck did they allow these banks 

3429
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:23,580
to weasel people like that.

3430
02:33:23,580 --> 02:33:26,490
You're not looking out for anybody's 
best interest when you do something like

3431
02:33:26,491 --> 02:33:27,324
that.
It,

3432
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:29,310
and obviously they didn't know they were
going to.

3433
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,570
The rates are gonna get as high as they 
got where people were.

3434
02:33:32,710 --> 02:33:33,840
Well,
they should all situations,

3435
02:33:33,841 --> 02:33:34,674
but they should've.
They should've known something was 

3436
02:33:35,581 --> 02:33:37,880
coming.
He hit the point though that they should

3437
02:33:37,881 --> 02:33:39,960
have succumbed in paid back.
Either should've been paid,

3438
02:33:39,961 --> 02:33:40,794
man,
none of those fucking people got paid 

3439
02:33:41,371 --> 02:33:42,204
back.
It doesn't matter how long you locked 

3440
02:33:42,541 --> 02:33:43,374
him up for,
like nobody fucking got their house 

3441
02:33:44,311 --> 02:33:45,440
back.
Yeah.

3442
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:46,433
Everyone got fucked over and even people
that were involved in the organizations 

3443
02:33:49,531 --> 02:33:52,320
that we're probably responsible in part 
for the recession,

3444
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:53,860
which fucked everything up,
they'll it.

3445
02:33:53,870 --> 02:33:56,040
Those people got bonuses when there was 
bailouts.

3446
02:33:56,041 --> 02:33:59,100
It the whole thing is the bailout should
have been for fucking everybody who lost

3447
02:33:59,101 --> 02:34:00,450
their home.
For sure,

3448
02:34:00,570 --> 02:34:01,320
for sure.

3449
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:02,153
It shouldn't.
The bailout most certainly shouldn't 

3450
02:34:03,661 --> 02:34:04,494
have gone to.
I know that they have to pay these 

3451
02:34:06,451 --> 02:34:09,180
people these bonuses because he's 
bonuses are in their contract,

3452
02:34:09,181 --> 02:34:12,390
but that's still crazy.
It's still crazy.

3453
02:34:12,391 --> 02:34:14,280
Even if it's in the contract.
I mean,

3454
02:34:14,380 --> 02:34:16,050
the government's got to bail you guys 
out.

3455
02:34:16,051 --> 02:34:16,884
You guys are a failed business.
It's banks have failed business and 

3456
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:20,133
you're still going to try to claim that 
you guys did so well that you need a 

3457
02:34:23,321 --> 02:34:24,850
bonus like this.
Great.

3458
02:34:24,851 --> 02:34:27,970
And you're going to take that taxpayer 
money and apply it to your bonus.

3459
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:30,460
So all those poor people out there 
working $50,000

3460
02:34:30,461 --> 02:34:32,770
a year,
you're going to just take a giant,

3461
02:34:32,990 --> 02:34:35,080
what?
What's a good one for one of those guys?

3462
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:37,150
What's a good one?
What's a good bonus?

3463
02:34:37,210 --> 02:34:38,043
What do you think is like the biggest 
bonus that one of those banker guys got 

3464
02:34:40,930 --> 02:34:43,150
during the bailout?
If you're going to get 300 million,

3465
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:45,520
oh,
is it that high?

3466
02:34:46,690 --> 02:34:49,510
I don't think it's that high.
Got 30 30 minutes.

3467
02:34:49,511 --> 02:34:53,350
At least that's what the JP Morgan Guy 
Guy last year yet last year.

3468
02:34:53,351 --> 02:34:54,670
Yeah,
but wait a minute.

3469
02:34:54,671 --> 02:34:55,930
No,
we're not in a recession though.

3470
02:34:56,210 --> 02:35:00,790
Like they were getting it at the end of 
uh,

3471
02:35:00,910 --> 02:35:02,440
bushes term.
Right?

3472
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:07,680
So that was 2009 he got 16 million.
Someone got 16 million guy.

3473
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:14,260
You got 16 million during the bailouts.
Well,

3474
02:35:14,350 --> 02:35:16,900
and his worst year,
you've got 20 million baller.

3475
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:20,650
We think his house looks like it's 
probably made out of cocaine.

3476
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:25,800
It's probably like a Igloo.
I walks by and licks the walls.

3477
02:35:28,750 --> 02:35:29,583
Here's the real question.
You give the average person 25 billion 

3478
02:35:31,721 --> 02:35:33,280
bucks,
they don't have to work again ever.

3479
02:35:34,210 --> 02:35:37,240
You know,
this guy's making 20 million bucks every

3480
02:35:37,241 --> 02:35:39,760
year or more probably with all these 
bonuses,

3481
02:35:39,761 --> 02:35:41,560
right?
Like what?

3482
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:43,030
What?
When do you get out?

3483
02:35:43,750 --> 02:35:45,610
Like how much do you have to have in the
bank before you go,

3484
02:35:45,611 --> 02:35:46,444
you know what,
I'm just going to fucking live frugally 

3485
02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:51,700
and never work again.
That God does not need to live frugally.

3486
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:53,340
He doesn't even any of that.
I mean,

3487
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:54,253
and money for most folks.
Like what's the number that you'd have 

3488
02:35:56,411 --> 02:35:58,120
to get to where you're like,
check please.

3489
02:35:58,810 --> 02:35:59,830
Yeah.
I don't know what the deal,

3490
02:36:00,070 --> 02:36:03,190
whatever that driving forces though to 
attain that.

3491
02:36:03,670 --> 02:36:05,950
That doesn't just magically go away.
You know?

3492
02:36:05,951 --> 02:36:07,360
It's not like you get to that point and 
you're like,

3493
02:36:07,361 --> 02:36:08,470
all right,
now I can retire.

3494
02:36:08,471 --> 02:36:10,300
Like what are you fucking doing?
Retirement?

3495
02:36:10,660 --> 02:36:11,493
Look at the people who continue to work.
You have a thousand things you love to 

3496
02:36:15,131 --> 02:36:15,964
do.
Right?

3497
02:36:15,970 --> 02:36:18,190
And you're good at them and you're 
obsessed with them.

3498
02:36:18,730 --> 02:36:21,190
Other people don't have that.
All they know is their job.

3499
02:36:21,191 --> 02:36:22,024
All they know is to work and they don't.
They have a hard time integrating when 

3500
02:36:25,331 --> 02:36:26,840
they come out of that,
you know,

3501
02:36:26,841 --> 02:36:29,860
you have to have something that gives 
your life meaning and purpose.

3502
02:36:29,890 --> 02:36:30,760
Yeah,
that's true.

3503
02:36:31,150 --> 02:36:31,983
Um,
it's hard for people to take up new 

3504
02:36:32,771 --> 02:36:35,020
hobbies too,
but really fun.

3505
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:37,960
That's the thing about learning stuff,
getting good at stuff.

3506
02:36:37,990 --> 02:36:39,910
When you suck,
there's a little,

3507
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:40,893
you know,
there's a period in the beginning of 

3508
02:36:41,441 --> 02:36:42,580
it's frustrating,
but once you,

3509
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:44,860
if you do do like anything,
no matter what it is,

3510
02:36:44,861 --> 02:36:47,800
especially physical stuff,
something about getting good at things,

3511
02:36:47,801 --> 02:36:48,760
it's very rewarding.

3512
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:50,710
You know,
not enough people go through that.

3513
02:36:50,711 --> 02:36:53,170
And I don't know,
people I think try new shit out.

3514
02:36:53,620 --> 02:36:56,260
And I think there's also new pathways 
that get opened in your brain.

3515
02:36:56,261 --> 02:36:58,630
The more you try something new that you 
suck at.

3516
02:36:58,870 --> 02:36:59,703
And will you start off from that 
beginner phase and try to like put it 

3517
02:37:02,681 --> 02:37:03,514
together.
And I think the little journey of the 

3518
02:37:06,161 --> 02:37:09,460
beginner phase getting good or I think 
we should try something new once a year.

3519
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:11,950
I really do.
I mean maybe more,

3520
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:12,933
but for me it can't be more than once a 
year because I get too crazy about 

3521
02:37:14,801 --> 02:37:15,634
stuff.
For me once a year it's like I might be 

3522
02:37:17,181 --> 02:37:18,014
able to squeeze something in once a year
and try it out for a little while and 

3523
02:37:20,031 --> 02:37:22,520
not let it overcome all the things I'm 
already crazy about.

3524
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:25,280
You know.
How often do you go hunting?

3525
02:37:26,750 --> 02:37:28,310
Well,
uh,

3526
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:29,233
it's usually in the fall for elk and 
then usually we do something in the 

3527
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:38,811
early spring.
Uh,

3528
02:37:38,811 --> 02:37:42,470
we go to Lanai and we hunt for access 
deer.

3529
02:37:43,130 --> 02:37:43,963
That's like the,
that gets you ready for a bow hunting 

3530
02:37:46,250 --> 02:37:49,880
because they were really difficult to 
hunt you there really fast.

3531
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:53,120
There's one out that access is 24,
seven in Texas,

3532
02:37:53,150 --> 02:37:53,960
24,
seven.

3533
02:37:53,960 --> 02:37:55,490
Yeah.
You can hunt them all day long,

3534
02:37:55,650 --> 02:37:57,740
but they have a real problem in the fact
that they,

3535
02:37:58,370 --> 02:38:00,250
especially in the night,
they have no predators.

3536
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:01,970
There's nothing,
at least in Texas,

3537
02:38:01,971 --> 02:38:06,971
they have mountain lions and I mean,
maybe coyotes are a situation for Fonz.

3538
02:38:08,030 --> 02:38:08,810
I think.
I would think,

3539
02:38:08,810 --> 02:38:10,550
I would imagine coyote's kits,
some phones,

3540
02:38:10,551 --> 02:38:12,070
but they don't really have many,
um,

3541
02:38:12,110 --> 02:38:12,943
bear to speak of Texas.
Although I think Texas is seeing a 

3542
02:38:15,171 --> 02:38:16,004
resurgence in black bear population.
They're starting to see sightings of 

3543
02:38:18,861 --> 02:38:20,230
black bear check Steve.

3544
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:22,310
That's true.
Um,

3545
02:38:22,670 --> 02:38:24,440
that would,
uh,

3546
02:38:24,441 --> 02:38:27,120
that would kill off some.
They kill off a shit load of deer,

3547
02:38:27,250 --> 02:38:29,100
a little,
a little bear or um,

3548
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:31,370
um,
little calves and um,

3549
02:38:32,180 --> 02:38:33,260
uh,
Fonz,

3550
02:38:33,290 --> 02:38:37,910
deer fawns and cow l calves.
When a cow elk rather gives a calf,

3551
02:38:37,911 --> 02:38:40,460
bears get those fuckers all the time.
They get like half of them,

3552
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:43,520
half of the Fonz bond born.
Damn.

3553
02:38:43,700 --> 02:38:44,533
Yeah.
They smell it a mile away or they have 

3554
02:38:45,681 --> 02:38:49,890
like insane sense of smell they can tune
into on.

3555
02:38:49,900 --> 02:38:50,733
We'll let go.
When when people shoot guns and kill an 

3556
02:38:53,901 --> 02:38:55,190
animal,
they think it's like,

3557
02:38:55,191 --> 02:38:56,180
oh,
dinner bell.

3558
02:38:56,240 --> 02:38:59,660
Like there's a real issue with that in 
like certain places where people hunt or

3559
02:38:59,661 --> 02:39:02,240
this bears once,
once you shoot something they go,

3560
02:39:02,241 --> 02:39:03,230
oh,
I'm going that way.

3561
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:04,123
I'm just going to take whatever the fuck
they shot and that'll be mine now and 

3562
02:39:06,411 --> 02:39:07,244
they can smell the guts.
Like as soon as you start cleaning it 

3563
02:39:08,530 --> 02:39:09,261
deer,
they smell it.

3564
02:39:09,261 --> 02:39:10,094
Like way the fuck away from you might be
going home with a bear and an access 

3565
02:39:15,351 --> 02:39:16,071
tier.
Yeah.

3566
02:39:16,071 --> 02:39:19,760
I don't know if they hear black bear 
spotted in another to Texoma town.

3567
02:39:20,030 --> 02:39:20,863
Yeah,

3568
02:39:22,340 --> 02:39:23,740
there's a picture of it.
There it is.

3569
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:24,693
It's fucking black bear.
Imagine if you did know that bears 

3570
02:39:26,471 --> 02:39:27,304
existed there and you were out in the 
woods at night and you saw that thing 

3571
02:39:28,780 --> 02:39:33,780
like it's a fucking warrior wolf.
You know they have video of it up.

3572
02:39:34,730 --> 02:39:35,563
Yeah.
I think it's just the picture on the 

3573
02:39:36,701 --> 02:39:37,481
trail.
Camera River.

3574
02:39:37,481 --> 02:39:38,440
That is,
oh,

3575
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:39,460
I see.
Yeah,

3576
02:39:39,461 --> 02:39:41,230
so now they know.
Yep.

3577
02:39:41,260 --> 02:39:43,480
That's definitely a bear.
Yeah,

3578
02:39:43,481 --> 02:39:46,480
they,
they travel fascinating animals,

3579
02:39:46,481 --> 02:39:51,200
man.
I mean if they weren't real,

3580
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:57,110
you know what a what an interesting 
thing that would be in fiction,

3581
02:39:57,260 --> 02:40:00,830
especially at Grizzlies,
Kodiak bears,

3582
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:03,320
you know what I mean?
If they didn't exist.

3583
02:40:04,140 --> 02:40:04,870
Yeah.

3584
02:40:04,870 --> 02:40:07,870
What a crazy creation that would be in a
movie and just seeing a barrier,

3585
02:40:07,871 --> 02:40:11,410
like what the fuck is that thing?
You know it's a star wars animal.

3586
02:40:11,710 --> 02:40:12,543
Well,
just being up close to one totally 

3587
02:40:14,221 --> 02:40:16,410
different ball game.
Have you ever seen one in the wild?

3588
02:40:16,890 --> 02:40:17,940
No.
When we were,

3589
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:19,013
I went to the Kenai River and Alaska for
salmon fishing on a bachelor party and 

3590
02:40:24,991 --> 02:40:28,440
in one of the tiny airports there before
we got in,

3591
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:31,830
they had a full size,
it's fucking hind legs and I was like,

3592
02:40:31,831 --> 02:40:34,410
good fucking God.
I had no idea.

3593
02:40:34,650 --> 02:40:38,820
Like no idea how big it was.
Same with Moose though.

3594
02:40:38,850 --> 02:40:42,420
Like I had no idea what's amount of 
Jamie happened here.

3595
02:40:42,660 --> 02:40:46,290
Woman says she's stabbed bear during 
attack in California Park.

3596
02:40:46,291 --> 02:40:48,120
Yeah.
They have black bear in Los Angeles.

3597
02:40:48,420 --> 02:40:51,330
Los Angeles,
Los Angeles.

3598
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:52,770
What?
What's your shit?

3599
02:40:52,771 --> 02:40:55,950
Joe Rogan.
Holy Shit.

3600
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:57,113
A popular park in California is back 
open Friday after a woman says she was 

3601
02:40:59,551 --> 02:41:00,384
attacked by a bear and had to stab it in
order to escape Los Angeles County 

3602
02:41:04,141 --> 02:41:08,100
sheriff's officials say the attack was 
reported at about noon,

3603
02:41:08,101 --> 02:41:12,900
Thursday on the Pacific coast trail in 
Los Angeles area.

3604
02:41:12,900 --> 02:41:14,040
Vasquez,
parks,

3605
02:41:14,041 --> 02:41:15,720
rock,
rocks park.

3606
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:19,080
Where's Vasquez rocks?
Holy Shit,

3607
02:41:19,081 --> 02:41:20,220
dude.
Look at this.

3608
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:21,220
She,
she uh,

3609
02:41:21,330 --> 02:41:22,163
was hiking on a trail as you turned 
around after seeing what appeared to be 

3610
02:41:24,571 --> 02:41:25,404
bear droppings a short times later,
she heard something behind her head and 

3611
02:41:28,681 --> 02:41:32,250
turned to see a small black bear 
approaching her at a fast pace.

3612
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:35,130
She pulled a knife from her backpack and
stab the band,

3613
02:41:35,160 --> 02:41:35,993
the left shoulder,
which made it stop and run away 

3614
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:40,020
authority.
Say The hiker was scratched on her waist

3615
02:41:40,021 --> 02:41:42,480
and her wrist,
but she refused medical treatment.

3616
02:41:42,481 --> 02:41:44,130
Holy Shit.
This pitches gangster.

3617
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:47,910
She stabbed a bear and she's a first in 
La to stab a bear.

3618
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,040
That girls ready though.
Respect,

3619
02:41:50,670 --> 02:41:51,810
right?
I mean,

3620
02:41:51,811 --> 02:41:52,644
she pulled that fucking knife out,
stab that bear and the bear scratched 

3621
02:41:54,991 --> 02:41:55,950
her and she's like,
I'm good.

3622
02:41:56,150 --> 02:41:58,380
I don't need to go.
To a fucking pussy ass doctor.

3623
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:02,910
I just dabbed a bear motherfucker.
Where is it?

3624
02:42:02,940 --> 02:42:06,330
Is it off the 10 what does that 
Palmdale.

3625
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:08,460
Oh,
interesting.

3626
02:42:08,820 --> 02:42:11,280
That's not Los Angeles.
It's like north of here.

3627
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:12,383
Okay.
Near Palmdale and bit Palmdale is way 

3628
02:42:14,791 --> 02:42:15,624
out there,
man.

3629
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:16,680
Where's Palmdale?
Okay.

3630
02:42:16,681 --> 02:42:20,730
It's halfway between here and Palm Dale.
Go back out again a little bit.

3631
02:42:22,050 --> 02:42:24,300
Where some of the streets of the cities 
road.

3632
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:25,700
Angeles forest.
It's right in between.

3633
02:42:25,740 --> 02:42:26,400
Oh,
okay.

3634
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:28,030
So it's near where the two is,
right?

3635
02:42:28,031 --> 02:42:29,120
Just north of Burbank.
Oh,

3636
02:42:29,121 --> 02:42:32,370
okay.
Is that the to the 14 it's then,

3637
02:42:32,371 --> 02:42:34,200
but this is the five and then this is 
the,

3638
02:42:34,620 --> 02:42:35,453
okay.
That Angeles Crest highway is gorgeous 

3639
02:42:37,591 --> 02:42:38,424
up there.
That's where Jay Leno does all of this 

3640
02:42:40,161 --> 02:42:40,994
stuff.
When he takes cars up there and like 

3641
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:42,953
does that Jay Leno's garage shit and 
drives up the fucking beautiful up 

3642
02:42:45,841 --> 02:42:46,860
there.
God,

3643
02:42:46,890 --> 02:42:48,690
it's crazy.
So that's where the bear was.

3644
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:50,670
That makes sense.
There's bears up there.

3645
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:55,290
There's bears in Santa Santa Barbara 
believe or not believe it.

3646
02:42:55,470 --> 02:42:56,520
It's mountainous,
right?

3647
02:42:56,550 --> 02:42:58,050
Yeah.
People find bears out there.

3648
02:42:58,980 --> 02:43:01,290
You spent time in there.
Santa Barbara.

3649
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:02,040
Yeah,
yeah,

3650
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:03,240
yeah.
I love it out there.

3651
02:43:03,270 --> 02:43:05,010
It's gorgeous.
You know,

3652
02:43:05,011 --> 02:43:08,760
it's um,
it's a real unfortunate what happened in

3653
02:43:08,761 --> 02:43:10,170
this last mudslide.
You know about that.

3654
02:43:10,171 --> 02:43:12,790
A lot of people died in a mudslide.
Heard about houses.

3655
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:16,210
Mild man,
I think it was last year.

3656
02:43:16,270 --> 02:43:17,103
He lives in the Santa Cruz mountains and
he was fucking trapped like not in his 

3657
02:43:20,501 --> 02:43:23,590
home but in a small town for two weeks.
Whoa.

3658
02:43:23,620 --> 02:43:27,190
Cause the road that leads to the 17,
how you get from Santa Cruz to San Jose.

3659
02:43:27,340 --> 02:43:29,200
Yeah.
Completely shutdown.

3660
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:30,423
Tons of mud slides.
That's right in the pch was shut down 

3661
02:43:33,221 --> 02:43:34,570
for a long stretch.
Right.

3662
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:37,990
I think it still is.
I think it's still down.

3663
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:42,070
I think the stretch,
the stretch of highway that takes,

3664
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:46,110
that'll take you from like San Luis 
Obispo all the way up to uh,

3665
02:43:46,810 --> 02:43:47,650
San Francisco.

3666
02:43:48,270 --> 02:43:49,630
That's,
that's the PCH,

3667
02:43:49,631 --> 02:43:50,464
right?
Yeah.

3668
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:53,070
There's a spot on the way to big,
sir.

3669
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:55,120
There's a spot where I don't think you 
can get through it anymore.

3670
02:43:55,690 --> 02:43:58,510
I think it's still fucked up.
See if that thing is still closed.

3671
02:43:59,380 --> 02:44:00,213
But it was cold.
It was a giant stretch that got wiped 

3672
02:44:02,171 --> 02:44:03,970
out.
Like they had these photos of before and

3673
02:44:03,971 --> 02:44:05,110
after.
It's like,

3674
02:44:05,111 --> 02:44:09,130
imagine seeing that go down magic bean 
in your little fucking mg convertible,

3675
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:10,900
ma'am.
Zipping along,

3676
02:44:11,020 --> 02:44:12,100
looking at the ocean.
Boy,

3677
02:44:12,101 --> 02:44:15,970
life is grand and you see just fucking 
mountain coming down.

3678
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:17,890
Just you.
You know this is it.

3679
02:44:18,010 --> 02:44:19,540
This is it.
This is how it's going to go.

3680
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:22,230
It's back open now.
Oh they opened it.

3681
02:44:22,810 --> 02:44:24,920
How long did it take to reopen it?
I Dunno.

3682
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:27,280
It's been open for earlier this year.
Ah,

3683
02:44:27,310 --> 02:44:28,690
Nice.
Let's good.

3684
02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:30,033
Oh,
how did they ever,

3685
02:44:30,220 --> 02:44:31,780
did they say how they figured it out?

3686
02:44:31,780 --> 02:44:34,810
Because there was some questions is 
whether or not they were going to dig it

3687
02:44:34,811 --> 02:44:35,644
out or what the Nigga put a new road 
over the top of the dirt that's there 

3688
02:44:38,651 --> 02:44:41,230
now.
Road tripping hipsters.

3689
02:44:43,140 --> 02:44:45,670
Is that what it says?
Does it say that road tripping.

3690
02:44:45,671 --> 02:44:50,671
Hipsters vacationing with families.
That's what a weird thing to say.

3691
02:44:50,980 --> 02:44:54,880
Residents or vibe by creating hiking 
trails that enabled people to bypass the

3692
02:44:54,881 --> 02:44:55,714
highway.
Closures by foot and those courageous 

3693
02:44:57,881 --> 02:44:58,714
enough to drive could take on the Nassi 
Nascimento first and a road with its 

3694
02:45:03,191 --> 02:45:05,530
hairpin turns and shit.
And steep drops.

3695
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:06,393
Yikes.
It crosses a Santa Lucy arrange and 

3696
02:45:09,011 --> 02:45:13,540
connects the big Sur coast with route 
one o one further inland.

3697
02:45:13,541 --> 02:45:16,600
Given the challenges,
several tourism businesses simply closed

3698
02:45:16,601 --> 02:45:19,060
up shop for the summer.
Wow.

3699
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:23,410
Imagine having a hike for food and Shit 
and you realize like,

3700
02:45:23,411 --> 02:45:24,670
oh my God,
we live in big Sur.

3701
02:45:24,850 --> 02:45:25,960
Like what?
We trapped,

3702
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:28,120
what are we thinking?
What the fuck we think?

3703
02:45:28,121 --> 02:45:31,930
And then the earth wasn't going to move.
You wouldn't have a knife on you or what

3704
02:45:31,931 --> 02:45:33,250
would you do?
You wouldn't have shit.

3705
02:45:33,350 --> 02:45:34,720
Wouldn't have shit.
You'd be,

3706
02:45:34,721 --> 02:45:35,554
we're out there with your birkenstocks 
on talking about your next Iowasca 

3707
02:45:38,351 --> 02:45:39,184
session and next thing you know,
I see that in mountain coming down on 

3708
02:45:41,441 --> 02:45:44,560
you.
Look through your fanny packs and like,

3709
02:45:44,561 --> 02:45:47,860
where's all the functional shit in my 
utility belt right now?

3710
02:45:47,861 --> 02:45:48,694
Don't even have a key.
Like at least you can have old school 

3711
02:45:51,101 --> 02:45:53,140
key and kind of cut things a little bit 
with a key.

3712
02:45:53,530 --> 02:45:55,630
Most people don't even have a fucking 
key anymore.

3713
02:45:55,810 --> 02:45:57,790
Keela century cars,
fobs.

3714
02:45:58,150 --> 02:45:59,710
You have a fog,
a key for your house,

3715
02:46:00,010 --> 02:46:03,790
and you get a fob for everything else.
Fucking fobs.

3716
02:46:04,750 --> 02:46:06,220
How long before we were those things?

3717
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:10,310
I have one in my wallet.
I have Alexis and it's a card.

3718
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:13,160
My key,
my key is a card card entry.

3719
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:14,480
Yes.
Keep it in the wallet.

3720
02:46:14,510 --> 02:46:16,130
Keeping the wallet.
Yeah,

3721
02:46:16,160 --> 02:46:17,150
I like that.
Yeah,

3722
02:46:17,151 --> 02:46:17,984
it's great.
Yeah.

3723
02:46:17,990 --> 02:46:19,850
So you always have your wallet.
You always have your card.

3724
02:46:20,330 --> 02:46:23,360
That's better because even with all the 
keyless entry shit now,

3725
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:25,850
like it's still got a spot for it in my 
fanny pack.

3726
02:46:25,851 --> 02:46:27,800
It's still taking up way more space than
it needs to.

3727
02:46:28,070 --> 02:46:28,903
Yeah,
way more.

3728
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,100
Right.
I'm this close to being one.

3729
02:46:31,101 --> 02:46:33,590
If you just didn't have to have that 
screen with you all the time.

3730
02:46:33,650 --> 02:46:34,483
Imagine if you could program your phone 
though to open up your car and then 

3731
02:46:36,201 --> 02:46:38,150
someone steals your phone and they steal
your car.

3732
02:46:38,180 --> 02:46:38,931
I can,
I mean,

3733
02:46:38,931 --> 02:46:40,520
you can't use the BMW APP.
Oh,

3734
02:46:40,521 --> 02:46:41,990
you'd have to open.
You can unlock.

3735
02:46:42,280 --> 02:46:44,480
Unlock my car.
I can make a beat from here.

3736
02:46:44,481 --> 02:46:47,000
I can turn the air conditioning on and 
like ventilated.

3737
02:46:47,660 --> 02:46:49,070
That's savage.
Dude.

3738
02:46:49,490 --> 02:46:52,250
I didn't know that was possible as you,
where you parked looking at you too.

3739
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:53,833
God Damn.
I didn't even know they could do that 

3740
02:46:55,191 --> 02:46:56,420
yet.
Turn that shit.

3741
02:46:56,710 --> 02:46:57,543
Cow.
Kingsburg we're living in the goddamn 

3742
02:46:58,310 --> 02:46:59,690
future.
We are.

3743
02:46:59,750 --> 02:47:02,030
We are.
There's no doubt you guys are setting up

3744
02:47:02,031 --> 02:47:04,850
the fucking little ai machine out there 
right now.

3745
02:47:05,090 --> 02:47:07,520
Oh that's not ai.
That's virtual reality.

3746
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:12,130
There's a big difference.
That's a vive dude,

3747
02:47:12,250 --> 02:47:13,083
but it's soon,
soon enough you're going to interact 

3748
02:47:14,301 --> 02:47:15,440
with shit.
That's going to be,

3749
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:20,060
it's going to change the world.
I think someone needs to set up a like a

3750
02:47:20,061 --> 02:47:23,660
Meu tie game on that vibe.
Like they have a boxing game.

3751
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:24,553
Someone needs to set some up with kicks,
you know and have someone at kicks at 

3752
02:47:27,501 --> 02:47:28,334
you.

3753
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:31,610
You know that's a hard to the technique 
a little bit.

3754
02:47:31,620 --> 02:47:32,453
Yeah,
it's your on the cakes and all that 

3755
02:47:33,711 --> 02:47:36,080
shit.
Like it teaches people to point spar.

3756
02:47:36,530 --> 02:47:38,230
It does.
But it wouldn't be your,

3757
02:47:38,430 --> 02:47:42,260
if it wasn't your only training,
if your was your only training,

3758
02:47:42,350 --> 02:47:44,270
you know like a lot of Thai guys go 
light anyway.

3759
02:47:44,271 --> 02:47:47,360
When they spar spar Thai style,
they're playing with each other.

3760
02:47:47,510 --> 02:47:50,720
You can kind of do that with this and 
just do it fast.

3761
02:47:50,900 --> 02:47:55,010
And then as long as you did like pad 
work and real sparring on top of it,

3762
02:47:55,340 --> 02:47:56,173
I bet it would add.
I bet it would add something just makes 

3763
02:47:58,971 --> 02:48:00,080
sense.
I mean you're constantly,

3764
02:48:00,081 --> 02:48:03,320
you're constantly being reacting,
but there would be no consequences.

3765
02:48:03,560 --> 02:48:05,300
Right?
Like you're not even feel it,

3766
02:48:05,301 --> 02:48:06,134
but you,
you would,

3767
02:48:06,490 --> 02:48:10,010
you would constantly be reacting to 
movement and he would get it to react to

3768
02:48:10,011 --> 02:48:12,050
you,
but there would be no consequences.

3769
02:48:12,050 --> 02:48:14,720
So you could do it all the time.
Not worry about like hurting yourself.

3770
02:48:15,380 --> 02:48:17,990
And you also wouldn't worry about like 
getting hit.

3771
02:48:18,020 --> 02:48:20,120
So you'd be a little freer with your 
motions.

3772
02:48:20,390 --> 02:48:21,223
I think if they,
they would have to be another human 

3773
02:48:22,551 --> 02:48:25,340
playing you though because if it's just 
fucking some computer,

3774
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:28,940
I mean they got to write it in an 
algorithm on how often the faint works,

3775
02:48:28,941 --> 02:48:31,340
how often it doesn't,
like if it didn't,

3776
02:48:31,370 --> 02:48:32,990
if it wasn't scared,
it wouldn't give a shit.

3777
02:48:32,991 --> 02:48:34,790
It would just block everything and 
destroy you.

3778
02:48:35,090 --> 02:48:37,970
Well it knows where your body is.
Right.

3779
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:41,030
Perfect distance.
So it has to have some sort of,

3780
02:48:41,090 --> 02:48:43,100
yeah,
you would have a haptic fucking jumpsuit

3781
02:48:43,101 --> 02:48:45,020
on.
You'd have a haptic look wetsuit.

3782
02:48:45,380 --> 02:48:46,213
I go all the way to the top.
And so if you get hit with like an 

3783
02:48:47,451 --> 02:48:49,250
inside leg kick,
you'd hear the slap,

3784
02:48:49,460 --> 02:48:51,230
you'd feel that slap on the inside of 
your thigh.

3785
02:48:51,230 --> 02:48:52,970
Like Whoa,
you know,

3786
02:48:53,240 --> 02:48:55,100
did,
it's not perfect.

3787
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:58,850
But I think that there'd be something 
really beneficial about that.

3788
02:48:59,050 --> 02:48:59,883
Just just constantly moving and 
constantly reacting to this thing in 

3789
02:49:03,471 --> 02:49:05,600
front of you.
You would just put in a lot of reps that

3790
02:49:05,601 --> 02:49:07,220
way.
Gauging distance.

3791
02:49:07,230 --> 02:49:09,420
Yeah,
a lot of reps.

3792
02:49:09,870 --> 02:49:10,703
But it'd be interesting to know like 
would it no when you really hit it with 

3793
02:49:14,371 --> 02:49:17,860
stuff or do we not hitting anything?
What about like when,

3794
02:49:17,861 --> 02:49:20,400
when are you getting jammed?
You know when you're hitting it and when

3795
02:49:20,401 --> 02:49:21,390
do you,
when are you two close?

3796
02:49:21,450 --> 02:49:22,770
Yeah,
I like the power meter,

3797
02:49:22,830 --> 02:49:23,630
right?
Yeah,

3798
02:49:23,630 --> 02:49:24,480
yeah,
yeah.

3799
02:49:24,481 --> 02:49:25,680
You learn at the kick.
It shouldn't,

3800
02:49:25,710 --> 02:49:26,950
it's not all kicks are the same.
Right.

3801
02:49:27,180 --> 02:49:29,190
Does it count the same just because you 
make contact?

3802
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:30,030
Yeah.
If someone,

3803
02:49:30,030 --> 02:49:30,863
if you go to throw a front kick and 
someone's here and you get your knee up 

3804
02:49:33,091 --> 02:49:33,924
high and then you push into it,
that's a big difference between the guy 

3805
02:49:35,701 --> 02:49:39,060
being here and you're just like kind of 
falling backwards.

3806
02:49:39,061 --> 02:49:42,060
Like does it know which is you back 
versus pushes him back.

3807
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:44,790
That's it.
That's huge with sparring,

3808
02:49:45,420 --> 02:49:50,370
having a good sense of distance.
I wonder how it knows that exactly where

3809
02:49:50,371 --> 02:49:51,204
your foot lands.
I think some of the coolest shit that 

3810
02:49:52,831 --> 02:49:54,510
I've seen with that is like this 
artwork,

3811
02:49:54,511 --> 02:49:55,230
you can do

3812
02:49:55,230 --> 02:49:56,110
those worlds.
Our game,

3813
02:49:56,111 --> 02:49:57,390
this is a,
it's not exactly,

3814
02:49:57,391 --> 02:49:59,670
this is crude of what you guys are 
talking about.

3815
02:49:59,671 --> 02:50:03,570
It's called drunken fist fight.
The guy's going to grab a pool stick and

3816
02:50:03,571 --> 02:50:05,010
crack.
That guy froze there.

3817
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:06,120
Yes.
Oh whoa.

3818
02:50:06,810 --> 02:50:07,643
So the sort of reacted to him,
but like right now the vr things only 

3819
02:50:10,201 --> 02:50:13,110
tracking the sensors so that you have to
have a haptic suit,

3820
02:50:13,250 --> 02:50:15,570
but it has sensors in it and I don't 
think they're quite,

3821
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:17,760
they're quite that far yet.
You know what I mean?

3822
02:50:18,560 --> 02:50:21,390
That'd be a lot of sensors and right now
that things is only tracking the headset

3823
02:50:21,391 --> 02:50:22,224
and the two things you put on your hands
and you can't add more of those to like 

3824
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:26,640
maybe put it on your foot or something 
like that.

3825
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:27,983
But it's not,
it's like just tracking it in space so 

3826
02:50:29,821 --> 02:50:30,750
it's not,
uh,

3827
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:34,740
it's not tracking impact or speed or 
maybe a little bit of speed.

3828
02:50:35,100 --> 02:50:36,300
Yeah.
This is a super crude.

3829
02:50:36,390 --> 02:50:37,860
Give it 10 years.
Yeah.

3830
02:50:39,700 --> 02:50:40,533
But you need lots of sensors.
I don't even even know what you would 

3831
02:50:42,791 --> 02:50:45,100
need to track of an impact.
Oh,

3832
02:50:45,101 --> 02:50:48,130
so you're in a bar and you're supposed 
to be fighting these guys in a bar.

3833
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:50,650
Yeah.
This is just super simple,

3834
02:50:50,651 --> 02:50:52,840
but like these are just programmed,
you know,

3835
02:50:52,841 --> 02:50:53,674
like ai bots that are just like watching
a swipe of a hand near its face and 

3836
02:50:57,791 --> 02:51:00,820
they've just programmed that little like
movement is all.

3837
02:51:00,930 --> 02:51:01,763
Hmm.
So you get,

3838
02:51:01,990 --> 02:51:04,090
I don't know,
I would say the long time away,

3839
02:51:04,091 --> 02:51:04,924
but maybe not.

3840
02:51:05,070 --> 02:51:05,903
I think the real move one day is ai 
robots that know Jujitsu and go at like 

3841
02:51:10,381 --> 02:51:12,030
50% speed.

3842
02:51:13,410 --> 02:51:14,070
Okay.

3843
02:51:14,070 --> 02:51:16,110
That would have to be the case.
You've been watching westworld?

3844
02:51:16,230 --> 02:51:18,780
No.
I'm watched the first episode of the new

3845
02:51:18,780 --> 02:51:19,613
season and I haven't.
I've been,

3846
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:22,380
I'm an on a a Kimmy Schmidt kick.
What's that?

3847
02:51:22,410 --> 02:51:26,490
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
It's a hilarious show on Netflix about a

3848
02:51:26,491 --> 02:51:31,080
chick who was stuck in a a bomb shelter 
with the religious call for 15 years.

3849
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:33,480
She comes out,
she doesn't know shit about the world.

3850
02:51:33,630 --> 02:51:35,000
It's really funny.
Matt.

3851
02:51:35,220 --> 02:51:36,550
Tina fey's show.
Oh,

3852
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:37,740
okay.
It's not a,

3853
02:51:37,770 --> 02:51:38,740
it's an excellent shot.
Yeah,

3854
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:39,061
yeah,
yeah.

3855
02:51:39,061 --> 02:51:42,060
It's a comedy,
so I take little breaks.

3856
02:51:42,090 --> 02:51:44,680
I go vikings,
unbreakable kimmy.

3857
02:51:44,681 --> 02:51:45,880
She got into Viking.
Damn.

3858
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:46,711
It's good.
It's good.

3859
02:51:46,711 --> 02:51:50,040
Give it a few episodes and that's shit 
heats up around episode four.

3860
02:51:50,070 --> 02:51:51,450
It's a good God damn show.
Yeah.

3861
02:51:51,451 --> 02:51:54,030
Season two of westworld heats up around 
episode four.

3862
02:51:54,510 --> 02:51:56,730
I watched the first episode and I'd just
been busy.

3863
02:51:57,570 --> 02:51:58,403
It's damn good.

3864
02:51:58,440 --> 02:51:58,960
I liked it.
Yeah,

3865
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:02,760
just anything that gets me to think 
about consciousness,

3866
02:52:02,761 --> 02:52:03,594
what that is and what it can be,
and then where our futures that I don't 

3867
02:52:06,701 --> 02:52:07,990
want to go.
I wish you had seen it.

3868
02:52:08,020 --> 02:52:08,853
I wanted to fucking die.
Who was the woman who plays the main 

3869
02:52:11,321 --> 02:52:12,820
character?
What is her name?

3870
02:52:12,940 --> 02:52:14,100
She actually,
I forget.

3871
02:52:14,101 --> 02:52:16,900
Shoot the actual act or something would 
madeline.

3872
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:21,310
She's a beast so that the girls,
she's so good.

3873
02:52:21,370 --> 02:52:23,080
Great actress.
She's so good.

3874
02:52:23,110 --> 02:52:24,940
That was married to a,
what's his name?

3875
02:52:24,941 --> 02:52:25,900
Right?
The um,

3876
02:52:26,590 --> 02:52:30,040
the goth dude.
Marilyn Manson.

3877
02:52:30,041 --> 02:52:31,530
Yes.
Um,

3878
02:52:32,680 --> 02:52:34,060
Rachel Wood.
Evan.

3879
02:52:34,061 --> 02:52:37,270
Rachel Wood.
Woods with an ass boy.

3880
02:52:37,271 --> 02:52:38,104
Evan Rachel Wood.
She does an amazing job of getting you 

3881
02:52:42,101 --> 02:52:45,670
convinced that she's both a person and a
robot.

3882
02:52:45,671 --> 02:52:48,640
It's really creepy.
Like she just nails it.

3883
02:52:48,970 --> 02:52:49,803
Like there's,
there's other people in the show that 

3884
02:52:50,681 --> 02:52:52,480
are great.
It's a lot of great people in the show,

3885
02:52:52,481 --> 02:52:56,380
but for whatever reason,
her combination and that,

3886
02:52:56,410 --> 02:52:57,940
um,
the British,

3887
02:52:57,970 --> 02:53:00,730
the lady with a British accent,
is that her name?

3888
02:53:00,910 --> 02:53:03,010
Mave she's a beast.
Yeah,

3889
02:53:03,011 --> 02:53:04,360
the hearn.
Phenomenal.

3890
02:53:04,361 --> 02:53:06,970
Same thing.
Like there's a scene with her,

3891
02:53:07,150 --> 02:53:07,983
I don't want to spoiler alert her 
talking to another one of these robots 

3892
02:53:11,110 --> 02:53:12,730
about her daughter.
And you're like,

3893
02:53:12,731 --> 02:53:13,564
Jesus Christ.
This is so fascinating because the 

3894
02:53:16,571 --> 02:53:17,404
writing is so God damn good.
And then the acting is so God damn good 

3895
02:53:20,231 --> 02:53:24,010
that it has this weird effect where you 
know,

3896
02:53:24,040 --> 02:53:28,120
they're kind of fucked up for people,
but they're not really people,

3897
02:53:28,270 --> 02:53:29,103
but they seem very,
people like there's just a perfect 

3898
02:53:31,481 --> 02:53:35,350
amount of off just the perfect amount of
like,

3899
02:53:35,351 --> 02:53:36,184
what in the fuck are you?
Well you get to see him learn to and 

3900
02:53:38,831 --> 02:53:41,710
figure out what it means to be 
conscious.

3901
02:53:42,520 --> 02:53:44,560
Anything.
Anthony Hopkins and I'm down,

3902
02:53:44,620 --> 02:53:47,340
I'm down to,
did you have you finished a,

3903
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:49,420
a wild,
wild country?

3904
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:50,770
No,
no.

3905
02:53:50,771 --> 02:53:53,520
I went episode one and I was like,
I don't even know if I could do this.

3906
02:53:53,540 --> 02:53:54,820
All you have,
I'm going back.

3907
02:53:54,821 --> 02:53:56,230
I'm going back.
Don't worry,

3908
02:53:56,260 --> 02:53:57,670
I'm going back.
I just need a little break.

3909
02:53:58,180 --> 02:53:58,991
Oh,
go ahead.

3910
02:53:58,991 --> 02:54:00,340
I've got real life shit to do,
man.

3911
02:54:00,550 --> 02:54:03,730
I'll give back to our promise.
I just that,

3912
02:54:03,790 --> 02:54:07,210
that there's something about cults and 
there's something about,

3913
02:54:07,211 --> 02:54:10,030
um,
like seeing people just hook,

3914
02:54:10,031 --> 02:54:12,280
line and sinker,
roll out the red carpet.

3915
02:54:12,460 --> 02:54:13,480
Here he comes,
here he comes here,

3916
02:54:13,481 --> 02:54:17,500
grab that stuff freaks me out.
That stuff freaks me out.

3917
02:54:18,310 --> 02:54:22,390
I think because I've seen it,
seen it with a martial arts,

3918
02:54:22,391 --> 02:54:23,224
especially seeing it all with a lot of,
a lot of the old school martial arts 

3919
02:54:28,211 --> 02:54:32,170
schools were very culty,
very culty.

3920
02:54:32,580 --> 02:54:33,413
You know,
I don't know if you've followed Mick 

3921
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:38,140
Dojo life on instagram.
Dude,

3922
02:54:39,610 --> 02:54:40,443
I'm just going to give you a treat here.
Mick Dojo life is a awesome collection 

3923
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:44,553
of the fakest martial arts you've ever 
seen in your life and something about 

3924
02:54:48,880 --> 02:54:49,713
these videos is so god damn compelling 
because these people who are the 

3925
02:54:53,231 --> 02:54:55,810
students,
they know the shit does not really work,

3926
02:54:55,900 --> 02:54:59,230
but they pretend that it works because 
they're just,

3927
02:54:59,260 --> 02:55:00,850
they're in a cult,
you know?

3928
02:55:01,390 --> 02:55:04,940
And this guy's like teaching people,
like if someone comes to grab him,

3929
02:55:05,160 --> 02:55:07,500
like to try to take him down like some 
wrestler and check it out,

3930
02:55:07,590 --> 02:55:10,130
it's going gonna put his hand here.
Give me some volume on those Jamie.

3931
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:15,040
Okay.
Small intestine.

3932
02:55:15,070 --> 02:55:18,700
It's going to get it right from the neck
and the bladder.

3933
02:55:19,340 --> 02:55:22,870
The bladder point right along the center
of the scalp.

3934
02:55:22,930 --> 02:55:24,530
Just making shit up,
dude.

3935
02:55:24,550 --> 02:55:27,760
Just making sure that we get homeboys 
mustache behind him.

3936
02:55:28,930 --> 02:55:30,370
He comes in,
he touches him,

3937
02:55:31,150 --> 02:55:32,900
hits him here.
Here.

3938
02:55:33,250 --> 02:55:34,240
That's how I need to do,
Bro.

3939
02:55:34,540 --> 02:55:36,280
Cain Velasquez shoots up.
Power Devil.

3940
02:55:36,460 --> 02:55:40,030
Just put that left hand.
Look at that is chaos.

3941
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:43,210
Came out on Bro.
Get him up.

3942
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:44,940
This is important.
Wow.

3943
02:55:45,220 --> 02:55:50,220
He smacks the shit out of them and this 
guy really believes us.

3944
02:55:51,820 --> 02:55:52,653
That's an antique.

3945
02:55:52,830 --> 02:55:53,760
Is he moved?
He says,

3946
02:55:54,240 --> 02:55:55,320
bitch,
try that.

3947
02:55:56,110 --> 02:55:58,590
Let's try that on Hanzo.
You fucking dummy.

3948
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:02,850
There's so many of these,
but this guy has like a,

3949
02:56:02,851 --> 02:56:04,950
an awesome collection of them.
Look at this.

3950
02:56:05,310 --> 02:56:07,230
The guy gets out and throws everybody to
the ground.

3951
02:56:07,970 --> 02:56:10,440
I am a master.
Just walk it.

3952
02:56:10,441 --> 02:56:11,550
This man,
they're all,

3953
02:56:11,551 --> 02:56:16,551
they're all grabbing him and he's like,
but I have super powers and you don't.

3954
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:17,873
They might as well be five.
They might as well be five year olds on 

3955
02:56:20,191 --> 02:56:22,890
a playground and one of them pretends 
he's doctor strange.

3956
02:56:23,160 --> 02:56:23,993
You grabbed me.
I'm going to send you back to more door 

3957
02:56:28,530 --> 02:56:29,980
first.
Can I just go straight forward?

3958
02:56:29,990 --> 02:56:31,190
It didn't even move for him.
Yeah.

3959
02:56:31,230 --> 02:56:32,940
It's so stupid.
It's so stupid.

3960
02:56:32,941 --> 02:56:35,340
But this is what I'm saying.
These are cults.

3961
02:56:35,670 --> 02:56:36,503
This is,
there's something about this shit that 

3962
02:56:37,531 --> 02:56:38,610
freaks me the fuck out.

3963
02:56:38,970 --> 02:56:39,803
And I,
my martial arts school that I started 

3964
02:56:42,031 --> 02:56:45,000
out in taekwondo school was very strict 
as a lot of discipline,

3965
02:56:45,250 --> 02:56:46,790
but it wasn't really culty,
but it was a,

3966
02:56:46,860 --> 02:56:47,520
every,
every,

3967
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:49,290
everyone is,
they're all a little culty.

3968
02:56:49,350 --> 02:56:51,150
They're all a little culty.
We'll,

3969
02:56:51,151 --> 02:56:53,250
there's master and Mr and all that 
stuff.

3970
02:56:53,251 --> 02:56:54,084
There's always a little bit of that.
But we would go to tournaments and then 

3971
02:56:56,251 --> 02:56:59,880
we would see it full on,
just full on cults.

3972
02:57:00,180 --> 02:57:01,013
Like one guy would be the Kung Fu master
and have all the students and all be 

3973
02:57:03,601 --> 02:57:05,820
added to command,
and he'd be telling them what to do.

3974
02:57:05,821 --> 02:57:06,311
And they're like,
yeah,

3975
02:57:06,311 --> 02:57:09,540
I shouldn't say they'd screaming out.
And she had just like karate kid.

3976
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:10,830
There's a lot of them,
man.

3977
02:57:10,860 --> 02:57:11,693
There's hundreds of these weird little 
schools that were run by people that 

3978
02:57:14,161 --> 02:57:15,990
were running their own little cults,
but at least,

3979
02:57:15,991 --> 02:57:16,824
at least at the tournament's,
like you guys are getting actually 

3980
02:57:18,391 --> 02:57:20,070
fucking compete,
right?

3981
02:57:20,130 --> 02:57:21,120
Yeah.
So the kids,

3982
02:57:21,121 --> 02:57:22,800
even though they're,
they're like dogs,

3983
02:57:22,830 --> 02:57:23,980
they're well trained.
You know,

3984
02:57:24,030 --> 02:57:25,170
they always listen.
Yes sir.

3985
02:57:25,171 --> 02:57:25,840
Yes,
sir.

3986
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:29,190
And they still get to get on the mat and
they experience lost the experience.

3987
02:57:29,191 --> 02:57:32,770
Some form of fucking real worldliness.
Yeah,

3988
02:57:32,771 --> 02:57:34,620
for sure.
It's not like the shit on mic Dojo.

3989
02:57:34,680 --> 02:57:35,431
Yeah,
no,

3990
02:57:35,431 --> 02:57:36,264
but the,
it's what's stunning about Makoto life 

3991
02:57:37,741 --> 02:57:39,610
is how many of them there are.
I mean,

3992
02:57:39,620 --> 02:57:41,010
there's,
and they're making videos.

3993
02:57:41,011 --> 02:57:43,200
This is the thing,
these people like scroll,

3994
02:57:43,210 --> 02:57:45,570
just scroll and show how many videos his
guys got up.

3995
02:57:45,900 --> 02:57:47,610
I mean,
I don't even know how many,

3996
02:57:47,611 --> 02:57:50,400
this probably hundreds.
But the thing is,

3997
02:57:50,401 --> 02:57:51,990
this is just what's on video,
man.

3998
02:57:51,991 --> 02:57:52,824
I don't understand how it,
all these people that come to these 

3999
02:57:54,931 --> 02:57:58,890
places,
they don't ask for competition.

4000
02:57:58,891 --> 02:58:01,800
They don't ask to see somebody.
They know any better,

4001
02:58:01,801 --> 02:58:02,070
but they

4002
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:03,720
always,
but is it always like,

4003
02:58:04,220 --> 02:58:04,801
you know,
Oh,

4004
02:58:04,801 --> 02:58:06,360
if I did this to a man,
he'd die.

4005
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:09,060
Is that what everyone believes?
Look at this one.

4006
02:58:09,150 --> 02:58:11,760
This guy,
when a guy has a knife to his neck,

4007
02:58:12,150 --> 02:58:14,370
he's gonna Smush the guy's hand with his
chin.

4008
02:58:14,400 --> 02:58:15,490
Watch this.
He's going to make the guy

4009
02:58:15,550 --> 02:58:18,040
tap.
Check this out.

4010
02:58:19,730 --> 02:58:22,990
You guys got a knife right to his neck.
And he's like,

4011
02:58:23,110 --> 02:58:25,000
but what you need to do,
try it on me.

4012
02:58:26,410 --> 02:58:28,690
As soon as he gets that knife near me,
not the same spot,

4013
02:58:28,691 --> 02:58:30,490
bitch.
It's not the same spot.

4014
02:58:31,450 --> 02:58:32,290
Right?
Watch this.

4015
02:58:32,470 --> 02:58:32,961
He said,
I said,

4016
02:58:32,961 --> 02:58:34,390
okay,
I give up,

4017
02:58:34,420 --> 02:58:37,480
but I will take my hand and then my chin

4018
02:58:38,210 --> 02:58:40,880
go hand like Das.

4019
02:58:42,410 --> 02:58:43,243
Watch this guy

4020
02:58:45,750 --> 02:58:47,500
dumb as shit.
Hurry up and get to it.

4021
02:58:47,980 --> 02:58:48,813
Here it goes.
Look,

4022
02:58:49,150 --> 02:58:51,640
he's making them tap.
He's grabbing his own hand.

4023
02:58:52,120 --> 02:58:54,720
Czi grabs his own head.
Oh.

4024
02:58:55,100 --> 02:58:59,830
Oh look at that.
You leave that arm bar for Rochus.

4025
02:59:00,010 --> 02:59:00,843
Ferocious said.
No point in time would that guy have 

4026
02:59:02,731 --> 02:59:06,070
been able to stab the fuck out of him 
with that giant knife in his hand.

4027
02:59:07,420 --> 02:59:08,253
That's just what is a little bit more 
believable than the other one was the 

4028
02:59:10,031 --> 02:59:12,460
one right next to it where the guys on 
his knees.

4029
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:13,830
Yeah,
that one right there.

4030
02:59:14,190 --> 02:59:16,290
Watch this one.
This one's so fucking stupid.

4031
02:59:17,100 --> 02:59:17,933
I mean

4032
02:59:22,220 --> 02:59:24,230
retained with that hand.
Reach me with that.

4033
02:59:25,010 --> 02:59:27,190
What do you see?
You cannot,

4034
02:59:27,560 --> 02:59:31,340
you can't reach me with that as this.
Reach me with that hand.

4035
02:59:31,430 --> 02:59:35,570
Reach me with that.
You can zoom in on

4036
02:59:37,630 --> 02:59:40,330
can handlebar mustaches like straight 
Ben Stiller.

4037
02:59:40,540 --> 02:59:41,373
But this is why I think I get freaked 
out by cults is that when I was a young 

4038
02:59:44,291 --> 02:59:46,060
teenager and I started doing martial 
arts,

4039
02:59:46,360 --> 02:59:48,640
I saw like certain elements of that.
I,

4040
02:59:48,670 --> 02:59:49,503
you know,
I went to Catholic school for just one 

4041
02:59:50,501 --> 02:59:52,970
year when I was young,
when I was seven first grade,

4042
02:59:53,010 --> 02:59:53,843
actually six,
right?

4043
02:59:54,340 --> 02:59:55,020
And,
uh,

4044
02:59:55,020 --> 02:59:58,750
it was fucking horrible.
And I remember thinking like that,

4045
02:59:58,751 --> 03:00:01,330
I can't believe all these people are 
just doing this.

4046
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:03,130
Like all these people were following 
along the way.

4047
03:00:03,131 --> 03:00:05,110
There was like so off.
Okay.

4048
03:00:05,111 --> 03:00:07,060
Enough with the,
I don't want to see anymore of these.

4049
03:00:07,061 --> 03:00:09,490
I can't,
there's just two other offices do.

4050
03:00:09,550 --> 03:00:12,100
But he's got hundreds of a man.
But,

4051
03:00:12,130 --> 03:00:14,140
um,
I recognize that,

4052
03:00:14,170 --> 03:00:15,280
like when I was young,
I was like,

4053
03:00:15,310 --> 03:00:17,410
this is not,
this doesn't make sense.

4054
03:00:17,411 --> 03:00:20,140
This is just,
everybody's just going along with this.

4055
03:00:20,140 --> 03:00:23,230
This is normal to leave your kids with 
this mean as none.

4056
03:00:23,231 --> 03:00:25,810
And all these fucking people are,
everybody's like,

4057
03:00:25,811 --> 03:00:27,820
stay in order.
Everyone's nasty to you.

4058
03:00:27,821 --> 03:00:29,350
And the hidden kids like,
oof.

4059
03:00:29,830 --> 03:00:31,630
It was awful.
And I remember thinking,

4060
03:00:31,631 --> 03:00:32,590
man,
ah,

4061
03:00:32,620 --> 03:00:33,453
there's something that happens to people
when they get big groups of them 

4062
03:00:36,251 --> 03:00:38,580
together and they agree on irrational 
shit cause set.

4063
03:00:38,581 --> 03:00:41,590
There's some weird thing that happens to
people where everybody,

4064
03:00:41,591 --> 03:00:42,424
this can't be right.
That lady is not acting in the name of 

4065
03:00:44,411 --> 03:00:45,640
God.
There's no fucking way.

4066
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:46,593
She's a crazy mean old lady and I got to
listen to her because she worked for 

4067
03:00:49,031 --> 03:00:51,400
God.
Like this is fucking nuts.

4068
03:00:51,640 --> 03:00:53,750
Can I talk to God?
Does he know how she asks?

4069
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,800
You got to talk through her.
She has a representative.

4070
03:00:56,801 --> 03:00:57,634
I got a phone line,
your fucking parents you there and drop 

4071
03:01:00,041 --> 03:01:02,320
you off and leave you with these 
monsters all day and you're like,

4072
03:01:02,321 --> 03:01:02,950
what?

4073
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:04,960
And some of them got fucked,
right?

4074
03:01:05,110 --> 03:01:07,090
Some of them got molested.
Not just some of them.

4075
03:01:07,091 --> 03:01:07,924
Quite a few.
So I think I had a healthy respect for 

4076
03:01:12,011 --> 03:01:14,740
that and fear of that when I was real 
young.

4077
03:01:15,100 --> 03:01:19,180
And then I saw some of the same elements
when I started doing martial arts,

4078
03:01:19,630 --> 03:01:21,990
particularly with like some of the more 
ridiculous like,

4079
03:01:22,810 --> 03:01:25,540
like really rigid traditional type 
styles.

4080
03:01:25,541 --> 03:01:27,700
A lot of Kung Fu.
There was a lot of like,

4081
03:01:28,030 --> 03:01:28,863
you know,
for every hundred martial arts schools 

4082
03:01:31,480 --> 03:01:34,120
you had three or four that were just 
flat out cults.

4083
03:01:34,720 --> 03:01:38,190
I just made those numbers up.
I have no idea what's accurate.

4084
03:01:38,200 --> 03:01:40,060
1%,
who was the guy,

4085
03:01:41,020 --> 03:01:41,853
I think it was in,
it was in China that fucked up one of 

4086
03:01:43,841 --> 03:01:45,880
these fake oh,
grand masters.

4087
03:01:46,020 --> 03:01:48,540
Then he had to go into hiding.
Well this guy,

4088
03:01:48,860 --> 03:01:50,240
two of them,
um,

4089
03:01:50,470 --> 03:01:51,820
one of them happened recently.

4090
03:01:51,820 --> 03:01:52,653
It was that,
that was the guy with the yellow 

4091
03:01:52,931 --> 03:01:53,770
sneakers on,
right?

4092
03:01:53,810 --> 03:01:55,180
He was an MMA guy.
Yeah.

4093
03:01:55,240 --> 03:01:57,850
Yeah.
And he fucked this guy up.

4094
03:01:58,310 --> 03:02:02,200
The not all of like two strikes to 
fucking dismantle that old fart.

4095
03:02:02,290 --> 03:02:03,520
Yeah.
I mean it's not,

4096
03:02:03,610 --> 03:02:04,443
it's not fair.
You're dealing with someone who's 

4097
03:02:06,070 --> 03:02:06,903
delusional.
But it is fair because we all need to 

4098
03:02:09,131 --> 03:02:09,964
see that because there's some people 
that really did believe that guy had 

4099
03:02:11,801 --> 03:02:12,634
magic powers because they run a cult.
Like these people that are doing all 

4100
03:02:15,581 --> 03:02:18,040
this death touched it.
When the see their students,

4101
03:02:18,041 --> 03:02:18,930
I go,
Huh.

4102
03:02:19,010 --> 03:02:19,843
And they fall down.
They believe that they're getting 

4103
03:02:21,401 --> 03:02:22,800
jolted.
And some weird might,

4104
03:02:22,840 --> 03:02:23,673
maybe not 100%,
but there's a small percentage of their 

4105
03:02:25,721 --> 03:02:28,300
bay brain that's willing to not just go 
along with it,

4106
03:02:28,420 --> 03:02:30,580
but to believe this guy,
something special.

4107
03:02:31,030 --> 03:02:33,340
That guy with the yellow sneakers didn't
give a fuck about that.

4108
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:37,000
He just beat the shit out of that dude 
and for everybody else.

4109
03:02:37,001 --> 03:02:38,290
But that dude,
that's good.

4110
03:02:38,860 --> 03:02:39,693
You know,
for that guy to to find out that he's 

4111
03:02:41,171 --> 03:02:44,590
not really some possessor of magic 
powers.

4112
03:02:44,860 --> 03:02:46,270
I mean,
if he really did believe it,

4113
03:02:46,480 --> 03:02:47,081
here it is.
Oh,

4114
03:02:47,081 --> 03:02:48,880
red sneakers at different one maybe.
No,

4115
03:02:48,881 --> 03:02:49,960
this is it.
This is it.

4116
03:02:51,910 --> 03:02:55,330
He just beats the shit out of this dude.
I mean real quick.

4117
03:02:55,360 --> 03:02:57,220
He just storms him.
Boom.

4118
03:02:57,221 --> 03:02:58,540
Hit some of the right hand,
boom,

4119
03:02:58,541 --> 03:03:03,130
another right hand and just get some on 
the ground and beat the fuck out of him.

4120
03:03:03,340 --> 03:03:04,173
I mean,
this is like maybe six or seven seconds 

4121
03:03:06,941 --> 03:03:08,590
before they stop it.
He's out cold.

4122
03:03:08,620 --> 03:03:10,900
Have those mats in my house.
Puzzle mats.

4123
03:03:10,930 --> 03:03:11,970
Yeah.
They're living at home.

4124
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:14,140
I check her.
I'm like that too.

4125
03:03:14,330 --> 03:03:15,850
You're an animal.
You keep in the living room.

4126
03:03:16,470 --> 03:03:18,580
That's we can it yoga.

4127
03:03:18,580 --> 03:03:19,413
We can role.
That's hard to wrestle with my son 

4128
03:03:20,741 --> 03:03:22,780
there.
You'd freak people out if they came into

4129
03:03:22,781 --> 03:03:24,250
your house.
If you are new in the neighborhood.

4130
03:03:24,670 --> 03:03:25,503
So a fucking hanging out with it for a 
minute and the living room come on over 

4131
03:03:28,661 --> 03:03:31,630
and have some Cacau dip into my cart.
Checkout.

4132
03:03:31,660 --> 03:03:33,610
Yeah.
It's like a mile dose of MDMS.

4133
03:03:33,970 --> 03:03:35,110
Hey,
look at my living room.

4134
03:03:35,111 --> 03:03:37,390
It's fucking wrestling mats.
Nothing creepy about that.

4135
03:03:38,360 --> 03:03:42,340
That's the mood he supposed to plug.
Giant dude.

4136
03:03:43,100 --> 03:03:47,530
This big Jack giant dudes drinking cow.
This fucking five finger toe shoes on.

4137
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:50,140
Yeah.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

4138
03:03:51,160 --> 03:03:52,360
That's the neighbor.
Yeah.

4139
03:03:52,390 --> 03:03:53,560
Come on in.
Come on in man.

4140
03:03:53,660 --> 03:03:54,320
Yeah,
he's,

4141
03:03:54,320 --> 03:03:55,630
he's,
he really loves yoga.

4142
03:04:00,770 --> 03:04:04,100
Isn't it funny like that sounds like a 
great thing if you were single,

4143
03:04:04,550 --> 03:04:07,520
you know like if you just a a bunch of 
guys living together.

4144
03:04:07,521 --> 03:04:09,020
I've heard a hundred stories.
Yeah.

4145
03:04:09,021 --> 03:04:09,854
We have our,
our living room matt it up and we just 

4146
03:04:11,391 --> 03:04:12,224
drill.
I know a lot of guys who've got really 

4147
03:04:13,191 --> 03:04:14,024
good because of that,
like Jujitsu guys that want to be in 

4148
03:04:15,771 --> 03:04:16,604
roommates with other Jujitsu guys 
instead of instead of just going to 

4149
03:04:18,681 --> 03:04:19,514
class everyday enrolling,
they would take like one or two days a 

4150
03:04:21,711 --> 03:04:25,100
week and they would do like a straight 
hour of nothing but drills and like,

4151
03:04:25,110 --> 03:04:25,943
dude,
you'd be amazed at how much better you 

4152
03:04:26,421 --> 03:04:29,090
get just from doing that.
That makes sense.

4153
03:04:29,190 --> 03:04:31,410
Those guys don't give a fuck about,
that's kind of what I do with,

4154
03:04:32,130 --> 03:04:32,963
you know,
I just get on the mat like I don't have 

4155
03:04:34,851 --> 03:04:38,090
the time now to go to a full yoga class,
so I'll just hit it.

4156
03:04:38,090 --> 03:04:40,040
Then I hear there,
it'll drop down.

4157
03:04:40,130 --> 03:04:40,963
My wife's yoga certified now,
so she'll put me through some shit and 

4158
03:04:42,951 --> 03:04:44,600
we could just do it.
That's very nice.

4159
03:04:44,660 --> 03:04:45,760
That's very nice to have.
Do you,

4160
03:04:45,790 --> 03:04:48,350
do you ever do it outside in the grass 
yoga,

4161
03:04:48,360 --> 03:04:52,480
rolling yoga and yoga outside in the 
grass lifestyle outdoors,

4162
03:04:52,790 --> 03:04:55,910
I think it is to like anywhere.
You know for sure.

4163
03:04:55,911 --> 03:04:59,210
I was doing it on the Cathedral Rock,
on the LSD and the cat cow.

4164
03:04:59,810 --> 03:05:02,510
That's a double dose on.
Is that candy flipping or what?

4165
03:05:02,540 --> 03:05:03,950
How's that work?
Cause it's kind of candy.

4166
03:05:03,980 --> 03:05:05,150
It's kind of cow flip.
Yeah.

4167
03:05:05,260 --> 03:05:06,310
Whoa.
Was that where candy flip?

4168
03:05:06,311 --> 03:05:09,260
It came from chocolate tea.
I had to think.

4169
03:05:09,261 --> 03:05:11,330
Cook has been around a little longer 
than LSD.

4170
03:05:11,650 --> 03:05:13,820
Right,
but the original candy flip must've been

4171
03:05:13,821 --> 03:05:16,460
Mtma with LSD.
Probably put,

4172
03:05:16,461 --> 03:05:18,380
maybe it was candy.
Maybe it was good cow.

4173
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:20,810
Fucking chocolate.
A little lsd.

4174
03:05:20,811 --> 03:05:22,390
Lace chocolate.
Hm.

4175
03:05:23,750 --> 03:05:28,750
What else should we keep an eye on as 
far as interesting substance stinks?

4176
03:05:29,290 --> 03:05:31,250
Substances that you didn't know can make
a trip.

4177
03:05:31,251 --> 03:05:36,251
Balls like now that we know it's Cocao I
get get cow shake at this fucking juice.

4178
03:05:37,450 --> 03:05:38,283
He Shit on Kik cow.
I'm saying it has similar properties so 

4179
03:05:41,180 --> 03:05:43,550
you're not going to see aliens so you're
not going to see a damn thing.

4180
03:05:43,551 --> 03:05:45,620
It's not a fucking triple dose.
Whatever you took.

4181
03:05:45,621 --> 03:05:47,240
I'll take three times as much.
We'll see what happens.

4182
03:05:47,540 --> 03:05:48,373
That was an issue though.
The issue is there's a lot of magnesium 

4183
03:05:50,541 --> 03:05:52,760
and could cow and I had facet for four 
days,

4184
03:05:52,761 --> 03:05:56,090
so at three o'clock I was like,
we need to go now.

4185
03:05:56,130 --> 03:05:58,160
Wow.
And I fucking sprinted down the mountain

4186
03:05:58,161 --> 03:05:59,420
for the shitter.
Whoa.

4187
03:05:59,510 --> 03:06:01,070
Straight liquid.
Go another one.

4188
03:06:01,260 --> 03:06:04,370
Another one that I was able to keep that
tight.

4189
03:06:04,460 --> 03:06:07,280
I was pinching the butthole like that 
lady with the vaginal clip.

4190
03:06:07,281 --> 03:06:09,380
Going to real accomplishment when you 
could do it.

4191
03:06:09,770 --> 03:06:12,410
I was a hard cagle Duncan,
I almost shit myself.

4192
03:06:12,411 --> 03:06:16,610
A few months back headed to the Improv.
It was real scared.

4193
03:06:16,880 --> 03:06:19,820
I got over the top of Laurel Canyon and 
I was going down Fairfax.

4194
03:06:19,821 --> 03:06:22,670
I was like,
I might not make it like this might.

4195
03:06:22,730 --> 03:06:25,430
I might not,
I might not make as you start sweating.

4196
03:06:25,470 --> 03:06:27,800
Yeah.
Sweating hard did not feel good.

4197
03:06:28,400 --> 03:06:30,620
I felt very nervous.
Very nervous.

4198
03:06:30,920 --> 03:06:33,320
Yup.
I don't know what else is out there,

4199
03:06:33,350 --> 03:06:34,183
you know?
I know we're were combined in some 

4200
03:06:35,150 --> 03:06:36,470
really cool shit.
I mean,

4201
03:06:36,471 --> 03:06:37,304
getting to work on the podcast is 
fucking amazing and thank you both for 

4202
03:06:40,550 --> 03:06:42,950
encouraging me to start one.
I'm glad you did man.

4203
03:06:42,951 --> 03:06:45,440
You're so good at it.
It's like such a natural thing to you.

4204
03:06:45,441 --> 03:06:46,970
It's,
it's hard to believe that somebody had a

4205
03:06:46,971 --> 03:06:47,300
prod.

4206
03:06:47,300 --> 03:06:48,133
You,
how do you not look at what you're able 

4207
03:06:51,381 --> 03:06:52,200
to,
you're,

4208
03:06:52,200 --> 03:06:56,610
you're constantly able to recite 
interesting about science or medicine or

4209
03:06:56,611 --> 03:06:57,460
physiology.
You're,

4210
03:06:57,461 --> 03:06:58,294
you're,
you always have the stuff at your 

4211
03:06:58,531 --> 03:07:01,020
fingertips.
Like why wouldn't you do a podcast?

4212
03:07:01,021 --> 03:07:03,030
Doesn't even make sense.
It all makes sense now.

4213
03:07:03,060 --> 03:07:03,570
Yeah,
yeah,

4214
03:07:03,570 --> 03:07:04,181
of course.
Yeah.

4215
03:07:04,181 --> 03:07:06,660
It's like being like really good at 
playing guitar and someone says like,

4216
03:07:06,661 --> 03:07:07,494
you man,
he should probably be in a band or 

4217
03:07:08,191 --> 03:07:09,540
something and you're like,
fuck that.

4218
03:07:09,730 --> 03:07:10,351
You're like,
I don't know.

4219
03:07:10,351 --> 03:07:12,330
It sounds hard.
It doesn't seem like something I'm going

4220
03:07:12,331 --> 03:07:14,130
to,
I'm not really into music.

4221
03:07:14,310 --> 03:07:16,630
Yeah.
Music.

4222
03:07:17,130 --> 03:07:17,760
So yeah,
we've got,

4223
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:18,593
we've got the podcast and that's a big 
child of mine at on it and then talked 

4224
03:07:21,570 --> 03:07:23,940
development would probably be the other 
big piece of that.

4225
03:07:24,130 --> 03:07:25,380
Let me,
let me in on this.

4226
03:07:25,560 --> 03:07:27,510
How the fuck do you make those protein 
bites?

4227
03:07:27,600 --> 03:07:30,120
This sounds like a commercial,
but those protein bites are,

4228
03:07:30,170 --> 03:07:31,520
there was a crack.
Well,

4229
03:07:31,530 --> 03:07:32,363
something in those things.
I've sent them to people and my friend 

4230
03:07:34,051 --> 03:07:34,801
Aaron Snyder,
he goes,

4231
03:07:34,801 --> 03:07:35,730
dude,
this shit's heroin.

4232
03:07:35,880 --> 03:07:39,930
Like what's in this?
You can't stop making them into one,

4233
03:07:39,931 --> 03:07:41,550
so it's actually a bite.
And we were like,

4234
03:07:41,580 --> 03:07:43,470
no,
people eat both.

4235
03:07:43,500 --> 03:07:45,690
Or if they do eat one,
they'll hand the other one off.

4236
03:07:45,720 --> 03:07:46,770
Yeah,
you give one to a friend,

4237
03:07:46,771 --> 03:07:48,450
it's not going to waste.
No,

4238
03:07:48,750 --> 03:07:49,583
no.
We've got four new flavors coming out 

4239
03:07:50,640 --> 03:07:52,860
and we've been,
I get to be the Guinea pig for that shit

4240
03:07:52,861 --> 03:07:54,630
too with Aubrey and a few other people 
on the team.

4241
03:07:54,631 --> 03:07:57,900
Etg Lindsey tastes so good.
Yeah.

4242
03:07:58,740 --> 03:08:00,720
And they don't make you feel bad at all?
No,

4243
03:08:00,780 --> 03:08:01,613
I have to eat them.
The new flavors are going to be fucking 

4244
03:08:02,701 --> 03:08:04,890
top tier two.
There's something about like,

4245
03:08:05,010 --> 03:08:07,830
there's,
I'm willing to get like a,

4246
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,740
a slightly adverse reaction if I'm 
hungry,

4247
03:08:11,310 --> 03:08:16,020
if I'm hungry and I want like a certain 
type of sugar free protein bar,

4248
03:08:16,021 --> 03:08:17,180
I'm like,
I'll just fucking eat it.

4249
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:18,930
I need something,
I'll eat it.

4250
03:08:18,931 --> 03:08:19,980
But while I'm eating,
I'm like,

4251
03:08:20,280 --> 03:08:21,570
what is this?
What's going on here?

4252
03:08:21,660 --> 03:08:23,820
What is this?
You know your body's going,

4253
03:08:23,821 --> 03:08:24,511
yeah,
you know,

4254
03:08:24,511 --> 03:08:25,344
this is a little weird,
like whatever the protein in this is a 

4255
03:08:27,481 --> 03:08:29,910
little hard for me to digest.
Here's a fart for you motherfucker.

4256
03:08:31,290 --> 03:08:35,100
But hopefully we'll probably flavor.
But with those protein bites,

4257
03:08:35,101 --> 03:08:36,780
it doesn't feel like you did anything 
wrong.

4258
03:08:37,020 --> 03:08:38,760
Was the problem healthy?
They taste good,

4259
03:08:38,761 --> 03:08:40,350
but they don't feel like you did 
anything wrong.

4260
03:08:40,590 --> 03:08:41,460
Yeah.
So you could eat.

4261
03:08:41,490 --> 03:08:45,150
That's the four of them to make 
something healthy that tastes delicious.

4262
03:08:45,240 --> 03:08:47,310
I eat for them all the time.
Uh,

4263
03:08:47,311 --> 03:08:49,110
I got it.
I got the thumbs up.

4264
03:08:49,800 --> 03:08:51,210
Normally I'm not allowed to talk about 
shit.

4265
03:08:51,211 --> 03:08:52,250
We're not creating,
but I'll,

4266
03:08:52,251 --> 03:08:53,084
I'll just give you this.
We're going to fucking make really 

4267
03:08:55,111 --> 03:08:58,080
delicious healthy cereal cereal.

4268
03:08:58,170 --> 03:08:59,970
Yeah.
Like cocoa pops.

4269
03:09:00,540 --> 03:09:02,340
You fucking name it.
Really?

4270
03:09:02,460 --> 03:09:03,990
Yeah.
How are we gonna be able to do that?

4271
03:09:04,530 --> 03:09:07,170
Well I can't give away the secrets,
but I'm just saying son,

4272
03:09:07,250 --> 03:09:08,850
they were going to have some fucking,
here's Lillian.

4273
03:09:08,880 --> 03:09:12,240
Is Milk healthy cause I handle 
contradicting.

4274
03:09:12,420 --> 03:09:14,130
I don't think so far.
I think for a lot of people,

4275
03:09:14,131 --> 03:09:14,964
it's not in California.
You guys can get raw milk that's 

4276
03:09:16,591 --> 03:09:18,660
healthier snacks.
Healthier is,

4277
03:09:18,670 --> 03:09:19,503
is raw milk healthy?
I think it's healthier than the killed 

4278
03:09:22,261 --> 03:09:23,760
off chef Lee health where they killed 
off,

4279
03:09:23,761 --> 03:09:26,160
get rid of all the,
the good bacteria that's in it.

4280
03:09:26,310 --> 03:09:27,450
100%.
100%,

4281
03:09:27,451 --> 03:09:28,284
no doubt.
And then raw goat's milk is supposed to 

4282
03:09:29,911 --> 03:09:32,010
be even better for you than that.
Yes.

4283
03:09:32,011 --> 03:09:34,050
And the,
the reason that we find out now that,

4284
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:34,913
uh,
do you ever read the plant paradox by 

4285
03:09:35,671 --> 03:09:37,020
Doctor Steven gundry?
No.

4286
03:09:37,080 --> 03:09:37,913
He's just fucking savage.
Did you bring this up on the first 

4287
03:09:39,421 --> 03:09:40,111
podcast?
We did.

4288
03:09:40,111 --> 03:09:42,420
I don't think I had read that on the 
first podcast.

4289
03:09:42,930 --> 03:09:44,670
Uh,
greenfield turned me onto this guy.

4290
03:09:45,560 --> 03:09:46,393
He says that there's a different type of
casein protein that Holstein black and 

4291
03:09:50,911 --> 03:09:53,160
white dairy cows make versus southern 
European

4292
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:54,970
goats.
Don't make it cheap.

4293
03:09:54,971 --> 03:09:56,770
Don't make it.
So if you're going to have dairy,

4294
03:09:57,280 --> 03:10:01,900
go with something from a southern 
European cow or go with like goat's milk

4295
03:10:01,901 --> 03:10:04,150
cheese,
a sheep's milk cheese,

4296
03:10:04,151 --> 03:10:05,140
those kinds of things.
But I mean,

4297
03:10:05,141 --> 03:10:06,880
if you're eating the fucking serial like
I'm doing,

4298
03:10:06,910 --> 03:10:10,150
especially when I'm doing Kido,
I'll throw heavy,

4299
03:10:10,151 --> 03:10:13,060
heavy a coconut cream in there.
Canned coconut cream.

4300
03:10:13,090 --> 03:10:15,850
We're making our own Kido ice cream with
an ice cream maker.

4301
03:10:15,851 --> 03:10:17,560
I do the same shit.
Damn.

4302
03:10:17,590 --> 03:10:18,880
You know,
phenomenal stuff.

4303
03:10:18,881 --> 03:10:21,370
I'll let my son mow that down.
You don't want dinner,

4304
03:10:21,371 --> 03:10:22,840
you just want ice cream.
Cool.

4305
03:10:23,350 --> 03:10:26,410
Whoa.
There's fucking egg yolks in there.

4306
03:10:26,411 --> 03:10:27,720
If there's no fucking,
you know,

4307
03:10:27,730 --> 03:10:29,290
it's all natural sweeteners.
No car,

4308
03:10:29,350 --> 03:10:30,183
no.
Uh,

4309
03:10:30,340 --> 03:10:32,260
nothing's going to fuck with his 
glycaemic index.

4310
03:10:32,500 --> 03:10:34,250
People don't think that that will be,
uh,

4311
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:35,753
you know,
if you,

4312
03:10:35,950 --> 03:10:37,690
everyone thinks you have to suffer 
somewhat,

4313
03:10:38,170 --> 03:10:39,003
right?

4314
03:10:39,340 --> 03:10:42,790
But if they could figure out to make a 
way to make something tastes like a real

4315
03:10:42,791 --> 03:10:45,160
ice cream Sundae,
like with whipped cream,

4316
03:10:45,280 --> 03:10:47,050
hot chocolate,
cherries,

4317
03:10:47,051 --> 03:10:48,850
everything and have it be super healthy 
for you.

4318
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:51,250
There's gotta be a way.
Lily's chocolate bars,

4319
03:10:51,280 --> 03:10:52,113
no affiliation with those guys,
but they've fucking figured out how to 

4320
03:10:54,611 --> 03:10:56,890
make chocolate delicious.
And they deal with Stevia.

4321
03:10:56,920 --> 03:10:59,020
They do it with Stevia and a couple of 
other things.

4322
03:10:59,200 --> 03:11:01,420
What is it called again?
Lilly's L,

4323
03:11:01,421 --> 03:11:02,051
I,
l,

4324
03:11:02,051 --> 03:11:03,180
l,
Y or I mean,

4325
03:11:03,220 --> 03:11:04,600
yeah,
they're at whole foods,

4326
03:11:04,601 --> 03:11:05,830
sprouts,
all those places.

4327
03:11:06,190 --> 03:11:07,680
They are fucking insane.
They're,

4328
03:11:07,681 --> 03:11:09,700
they're really,
they're really insane.

4329
03:11:10,510 --> 03:11:12,070
They've got it dialed in,
but I mean you,

4330
03:11:12,071 --> 03:11:14,770
if you could melt that down on some 
homemade ice cream.

4331
03:11:16,360 --> 03:11:17,193
That's something that I tell people a 
lot is if you're going to cheat or if 

4332
03:11:20,561 --> 03:11:23,350
you're going to eat for mouth pleasure,
make it yourself.

4333
03:11:23,440 --> 03:11:24,273
Right?
You don't make your own fucking pizza 

4334
03:11:25,301 --> 03:11:28,440
with a better crust.
Make your own dessert with,

4335
03:11:28,441 --> 03:11:31,000
with shit that's not going to spike your
blood sugar and make you fat,

4336
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:32,770
cause inflammation and fuck your brain 
up.

4337
03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:35,500
Like just make it yourself.
Go the extra fucking mile.

4338
03:11:35,710 --> 03:11:37,900
Do it yourself.
It'll be way healthier.

4339
03:11:38,400 --> 03:11:41,050
I'd be able to have time for that shit.
Well,

4340
03:11:41,110 --> 03:11:42,940
you have time to make your own Kido 
waffles.

4341
03:11:43,620 --> 03:11:44,680
Really?
No,

4342
03:11:45,120 --> 03:11:45,953
I don't do that.

4343
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:50,860
I don't like those waffles.
I've watched your,

4344
03:11:50,950 --> 03:11:53,380
you were talking about them and I saw it
and they did a repost.

4345
03:11:54,010 --> 03:11:55,840
Haven't tried their waffles or their 
syrup,

4346
03:11:55,841 --> 03:11:58,360
but I'm down to try.
I just haven't found the syrup anywhere.

4347
03:11:58,510 --> 03:11:59,131
They,
well,

4348
03:11:59,131 --> 03:11:59,964
you get it from their website and then I
fucked up some of their waffles with 

4349
03:12:02,801 --> 03:12:05,170
some syrup and just a pound of butter on
it.

4350
03:12:05,500 --> 03:12:07,540
It was a sensational,
that sounds like a good idea.

4351
03:12:07,541 --> 03:12:10,360
I didn't feel bad after it was over.
I felt good.

4352
03:12:10,390 --> 03:12:11,740
I was like,
I don't even feel terrible.

4353
03:12:11,770 --> 03:12:13,300
That's the goal of creating shit like 
that.

4354
03:12:13,301 --> 03:12:14,134
Right.
We've got a ton of Quito shakes now at 

4355
03:12:15,191 --> 03:12:18,130
the anet cafe.
They will fucking change your life.

4356
03:12:18,131 --> 03:12:20,500
Damn.
They're insanely good changing.

4357
03:12:20,560 --> 03:12:21,910
Yeah,
no doubt.

4358
03:12:21,970 --> 03:12:23,950
And they don't make you feel bad.
That's the key.

4359
03:12:23,951 --> 03:12:25,320
Right?
Like if there aren't some,

4360
03:12:25,420 --> 03:12:27,220
like I'll tell you know,
plug here,

4361
03:12:27,450 --> 03:12:29,050
uh,
these fucking kill cliffs.

4362
03:12:29,500 --> 03:12:30,333
These are God damn delicious.
I don't have any business affiliation 

4363
03:12:32,771 --> 03:12:34,110
with them,
but they don't.

4364
03:12:34,330 --> 03:12:36,640
How much sugar does this thing having it
zero.

4365
03:12:36,641 --> 03:12:41,230
It's just a zero,
zero sugar should taste good,

4366
03:12:41,470 --> 03:12:43,810
but it doesn't have any bullshit in it.
Right?

4367
03:12:43,811 --> 03:12:44,644
I mean,
this doesn't have any aspartame or 

4368
03:12:45,401 --> 03:12:46,870
anything.
What are they using it for?

4369
03:12:46,871 --> 03:12:49,000
Uh,
what are they using this to,

4370
03:12:49,480 --> 03:12:51,380
to sweeten it?
It Tall?

4371
03:12:51,470 --> 03:12:52,130
What does that,

4372
03:12:52,130 --> 03:12:55,190
it's a natural sweetener that's 
low-glycemic similar to Stevia.

4373
03:12:56,330 --> 03:12:57,680
Xylitol,
similar to Stevia,

4374
03:12:57,710 --> 03:12:59,390
but they all have different flavor 
components.

4375
03:12:59,391 --> 03:13:01,940
So some of them work better for an 
energy drink.

4376
03:13:01,941 --> 03:13:04,460
Some of them work better for ice cream,
shit like that.

4377
03:13:04,610 --> 03:13:07,460
This is recovery and hydration.
So what it is,

4378
03:13:07,550 --> 03:13:11,390
this shit tastes fantastic and then 
there's no bad feeling afterwards.

4379
03:13:11,750 --> 03:13:13,490
Like if I drank that and that was a 
coke,

4380
03:13:13,700 --> 03:13:17,400
I'd be like,
oh so good going down a cold coke in the

4381
03:13:17,401 --> 03:13:20,510
aluminum can you crack the top and it's 
got the fucking,

4382
03:13:20,511 --> 03:13:23,750
the condensation all over the top of it 
cause it's so cold.

4383
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:27,980
I haven't had a coke and hold it out of 
the cooler and years drawing way.

4384
03:13:28,220 --> 03:13:30,110
Especially if you have some barbecue 
dude,

4385
03:13:30,111 --> 03:13:30,944
you're in the middle of the slab of ribs
and you'd go for that cold coke and you 

4386
03:13:34,061 --> 03:13:34,751
just chug,
chug,

4387
03:13:34,751 --> 03:13:35,440
chug,
chug.

4388
03:13:35,440 --> 03:13:40,440
You'll feel the Sara Nay outta here.
You feel that the thick syrup mega,

4389
03:13:41,001 --> 03:13:44,810
it's weighty weightier vein law,
but for that mouth pleasure you'll trade

4390
03:13:44,811 --> 03:13:45,644
at all.
Do you like the CSEA mother fucking 

4391
03:13:48,111 --> 03:13:49,450
amazing by them all the time.
It doesn't,

4392
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:52,580

things that have sugar in them.

4399
03:14:04,041 --> 03:14:06,140
You know,
if we could find healthy alternatives,

4400
03:14:07,010 --> 03:14:09,500
it's possible they're coming out.
