1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,340
Yeah,
start getting started digging deep,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,550
na na,
na,

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,540
na,
na na.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,290
Hey Brian Taylor,
somebody.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,900
I watched it to rainy,
cozy Thursday.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,250
Adorable.
They say on rainy days that people are a

7
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:22,251
little bit more devious.
So if you have an honor jar where you 

8
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:25,500
gotta put like tips,
you know if you take a Bagel at the 

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,450
office and you're supposed to put like a
dollar in there on rainy days.

10
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:31,080
Some people tend to not do that.
Like I'm not going to give it's raining.

11
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,390
I'm taking a break from being honest.
Really?

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,190
I wonder why rain does that.
I don't know what girls are always like.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,250
It's funny.
It always reminds me of like past 

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,070
girlfriends who would call and be like,
let's go fuck on our roof.

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,290
And I'm always like,
man God girls,

16
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,720
you're dating wet.
Good time.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,700
God of guy there aren't that stable of 
that low self esteem and daddy issues.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,750
Kinda want to fuck on a roof.
I would tell you that when I take girls,

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,180
when I would take women's shopping back 
in the day,

20
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:05,181
I ain't even happens with my wife.
Now I get a little horny because like 

21
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:09,111
I'm the man who behind them.
I love that shit you're providing 

22
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,770
whether at home with my wife when before
we got married,

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,370
she wanted these shoes and they were 
fucking high heeled sneakers,

24
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:19,371
right?
I'm like some asshole named Ted calls 

25
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,531
himself,
Christiane Newbie and now I've got to 

26
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:21,531
pay $800 for a high heeled sandal.
Stanley.

27
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:24,120
I mean the amount of leather that goes 
into a sandal and.

28
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,750
But they're the two women are sales 
women and I'm the man.

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,820
I'm the man and I'm in A.
I think it wasn't a linen shirt and I 

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,410
had a blazer on Ellen and blazer.
I spent too much money and I'm,

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,470
and I'm taking a girl on a little 
weekend in Santa Barbara.

32
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,990
I'm the man,
the man probably not even working at the

33
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:40,770
time,
but whatever.

34
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,430
And she tries on these luby or whatever 
the fuck Jimmy Choo's.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,400
And she goes,
God,

36
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:52,401
they're so amazing.
And the woman brings out another pair 

37
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:52,401
and she'd pitch,
Yep,

38
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,550
that bitches.
Right?

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,250
And she goes,
I can't decide.

40
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,850
Saleswoman goes,
get them both.

41
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:00,600
And she goes,
Oh my God,

42
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:01,710
I've never do that,
and I go,

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,090
if you want them both,
and she goes and she this bitch,

44
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,150
God bless her for my wife.
She hides behind their own hand and she 

45
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,300
goes,
you're going to ruin me for other men.

46
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,020
And I was like,
get both the fucking get bulldog and 

47
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,810
shoes.
I won't eat meat for the month,

48
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:23,180
but get the Vulcan you buy.
I'll buy that dress too.

49
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,190
I'm going to help you try it out in,
in the.

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,550
Basically what you're doing,
Brian,

51
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:32,551
is just perpetuating these gender 
stereotypes that have been essentially 

52
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,600
boxing people into these behavior 
patterns for years.

53
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,300
It's not that they're natural,
it's totally cultural.

54
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,840
It's totally something that our society 
has constructed.

55
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:44,710
It's a cultural context or construct or 
other.

56
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,590
Sorry for being a provider.
No,

57
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,100
no,
no.

58
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,630
You're not.
Who you are is the patriarchy.

59
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,830
You are the patriarch.
You want to shatter the patriarchy.

60
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,630
I want to just break all the glass 
ceilings.

61
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:58,930
Brian Rose Mcgowan,
who I think is sexy as all get out,

62
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,220
was on the cover of some

63
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,940
terrible magazine and she's in a leather
jacket.

64
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,990
Dress like a man.
Of course.

65
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,410
It's interesting how when you want to 
shatter the patriarchy,

66
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,630
your dress pants,
I think she had gloves with the fingers 

67
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,630
cut out.
Maybe she didn't,

68
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,980
but in my mind she did and she's hanging
onto some.

69
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,750
She's hanging.
She's looking like that.

70
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:17,790
Maybe a cigarette.
I romanced.

71
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,500
She's a bad bitch by the way.
Head is shaped,

72
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,550
not fucking around her head shaved and 
the caption is she wants to shatter the 

73
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,320
patriot.
I would say if I had a crack at that,

74
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,730
I would.
I would be the.

75
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,040
I turned into the biggest fucking 
liberal in the world.

76
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:44,041
I'd be like,
you are 100 percent right and I'll do 

77
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:44,170
it.
If I could cook you some food right now,

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,800
just lose your shirt,
an archer back and lick your lips after 

79
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:49,900
we're done.
Dah,

80
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,430
Dah.

81
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,890
Isn't it funny how a really hot girl 
back in the day get you to do anything?

82
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,190
Literally be like,
I have.

83
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,530
My joke is always like,
if,

84
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,550
if I don't care,
if it's a black guy there she is so hot 

85
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:01,550
as fuck with shit.
She's so hot.

86
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,240
She's amazing.
She too crazy is.

87
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:09,241
I wish you to stopped working.
I'm just nodding and I would imagine.

88
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,480
I would imagine that she's probably.
I mean,

89
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,760
she stopped working there.
Hers Dad,

90
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:17,410
her dad was a coal leader.
Oh,

91
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,820
well she's fucked.
Yeah.

92
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,890
Oh yeah.
That.

93
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:22,810
I think she's possibly.
She quit acting hint,

94
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,570
Hollywood sexism.
I'm running away now.

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Yeah.
This is right about the time where 

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,450
runaway.
What am I supposed to do with that 

97
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,450
information?
What is that?

98
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,450
Hollywood sexism.
You're so hot.

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,420
I remember meeting her after she'd done 
doom generation at Erewhon my first year

100
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:38,140
in Los Angeles.

101
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,730
I was so into.
I was like,

102
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,930
uh,
hi.

103
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm on mad TV.
I think that was the next thing I said.

104
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:44,380
Anything.
They try to get her attention.

105
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,390
She had no time for me at all,
but you know,

106
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,990
she was so you.
You enjoy privilege.

107
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,960
You have your house and all that stuff 
because you have a bone structure.

108
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,090
That and a body that makes men sweat.
It's just my genetics.

109
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,300
I'm not trying to be A.
I'm not profiting off of a fortunate 

110
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,081
role.
The dice plus her acting and also she 

111
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:09,661
says,
I can't stand when men say smiled at me 

112
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:09,661
and all that.
That was gross.

113
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:09,661
It's gross,
but.

114
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:11,380
But how about this?
How about looking at this way?

115
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Hey,
sometimes we're so flummoxed by your 

116
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,700
beauty and power that we want to say.
We'll just say anything.

117
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,670
Most of the time you can't even look at 
her.

118
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,200
Then when you want to get to her,
you just want to say anything.

119
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:25,300
Just so she looks at you and it's 
clumsy.

120
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:26,530
Yeah,
but maybe that's you,

121
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,200
but there's a lot of Dick wants.
I'm not clumsy women.

122
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,730
And they go,
uh hey,

123
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,570
why don't you smile?
You look better if you're smaller,

124
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,700
but it.
Come on,

125
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,990
man.
That's super common.

126
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,870
I consider it the same thing as a guy 
who has a bad sense of humor,

127
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,740
right?
Yeah.

128
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,580
I have a friend.
You have friends that,

129
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,990
you know that guy,
but when you're a woman in a guy's doing

130
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:48,991
it to you,
it has the feeling of danger touch to 

131
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:48,991
it.
I know.

132
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:53,070
I understand when a guy's pursuing a 
woman and he's saying things like that 

133
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,580
and he's kind of gross and clumsy.
We think of it as like a dude being 

134
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,871
gross and clumsy to us,
but a guy being gross and clumsy to you 

135
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:00,871
doesn't.

136
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:02,900
You don't feel like you might get raped.
Yeah.

137
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,240
I just feel like you'll feel a little 
weird.

138
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,030
I know,
but like girls' a different world.

139
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,270
They're physically vulnerable.
Yeah.

140
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,740
That's never been any different.
Right.

141
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,660
Well,
it's never been any different,

142
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:22,661
but they never had the ability to 
express themselves like there's never 

143
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:23,150
been any opportunity to do,
you know,

144
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,620
put up a post on facebook about the way 
you feel about something and have people

145
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,750
react to it.
Yeah.

146
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,110
I guess,
um,

147
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,140
I also think that there are some women 
that embrace it and turn it into an 

148
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,130
advantage.
I think people get into anything,

149
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,380
man.
They get into anything and everything.

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,860
They get into it.
You know,

151
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,740
I'm in a bit defines it,
defines them.

152
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:46,010
I'm into playing water polo hockey or 
just water hockey fight.

153
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,310
I'm a fighter.
I know.

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,130
Well,
I was gonna say water polo and I'm like,

155
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:50,000
that's just too ridiculous.

156
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,010
Pocket water on it's hockey underwater.
I blamed the weed.

157
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,540
Yeah.
I don't know,

158
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:01,541
man.
People get into things and they might 

159
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,131
get into activism and they might get 
into the response they get from other 

160
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,750
people because they embrace activism.
They that that's as much of an addiction

161
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:10,751
as anything else and sometimes those 
addictions lead to really great work 

162
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:14,770
because people do get addicted to the 
adulation that they get from doing good 

163
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,331
things,
so they continue to do good things and 

164
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:19,670
it becomes their thing and letting 
everyone know about how much good things

165
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:21,980
they're doing.
That's why it's so amazing when you find

166
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,810
out about someone who does things 
quietly,

167
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,170
like someone would donate some money 
quietly or helps people quietly and not 

168
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,270
trying to get any attention whatsoever 
for it.

169
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:29,630
You Go,
oh,

170
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:32,070
well that's real.
This is real altruism.

171
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,080
And so on.
Truman said that Truman said something 

172
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,080
like,
I read a quote,

173
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,971
he said,
you'd be amazed at how much you can get 

174
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:42,820
accomplished if you're not worried about
who gets the credit for it like that.

175
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,870
That's an important thing.
I think that's how charity should be 

176
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:47,870
given.
I mean,

177
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,800
if you put your name on the territory 
around the building,

178
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,660
you know?
Yeah.

179
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,670
There's.
I mean I guess it's as long as good 

180
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,301
charity gets done.
Charity to me has always been a very 

181
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:59,690
strange thing because it's.
It is super important.

182
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,790
You know that people help people out,
but when you find out how much of these 

183
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,060
organizations actually spend the money 
on the charity itself and how much of it

184
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,160
goes to the structure of the 
organization,

185
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,840
it's crazy.
They're like what?

186
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,550
And nuts and they all lie about it.
They all lie about how much money it 

187
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,410
actually because they just.
They do fancy accounting right?

188
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,680
To the Clinton Foundation is a good 
example.

189
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,690
Bad something they don't know yet,
but that was pretty astonishing at how 

190
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,461
much went to running the corporation and
how much it's going to be really 

191
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,430
interesting to see.

192
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,580
How much the Clinton Foundation can 
raise now that both of them have no 

193
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,730
political influence anymore?
Well,

194
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,050
they still have influence.
Right,

195
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:44,051
but they just don't mention she.
They have no influence in how to move 

196
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:48,821
American policy.
When she was secretary of state and her 

197
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,341
husband was.
Do you think she'll do something like 

198
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:51,341
run for senator again now?
I don't think she'll ever run for office

199
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:51,540
again.
I.

200
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,020
that's what I.
that's what her closest advisors say.

201
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,320
Oh,
you're just wore out.

202
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,940
I think so.
Fuck you.

203
00:08:56,941 --> 00:09:01,941
It had to have.
I mean she didn't even want to go to 

204
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,600
these places to be 70 and she's not a 
healthy 70 either.

205
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,840
That was one of the other super annoying
things about this election is that if 

206
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,960
you brought up her health,
you are sexist.

207
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,330
I,
I experienced that a couple of times.

208
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,570
People reacting,
like would you have brought up the fact 

209
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:17,910
that she was fainting if she was a man 
like fucking.

210
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,750
Of course whenever a 70 year old person 
has just fainting,

211
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,300
fainting is really fucking bad.
People die from faint.

212
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,270
Yeah.
She almost died from fainting.

213
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,480
She banged her fucking head off the 
ground in 2012 and Bill Clinton didn't 

214
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,030
an interview,
said she was fucked up for six months.

215
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,780
Wow.
Yeah,

216
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,130
I paraphrase.
He didn't say it.

217
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,620
He said it that way though.
She was fucked up.

218
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm telling you,
that bitch fell back out.

219
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:46,521
Cold cracks or head off the curb out my 
dick,

220
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,930
out her mouth.
I cried on Monica tests for awhile.

221
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,660
Poor Monica.
What's she doing now?

222
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Scraping shame off of her forever.
She did a round table,

223
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:03,840
our discussion and it was always 
supportive of college students.

224
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,230
It's really funny.
She's talking and she's kind of talking 

225
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,230
about her experience and some dude gets 
up and goes,

226
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,420
well,
what's it like to be an attention whore 

227
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,610
and have sex for money if something like
that,

228
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,210
like really hard and it was just this.

229
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,050
She was like,
wow,

230
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,970
I guess I helped myself up for this kind
of thing.

231
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,670
And she handled it well.
It wasn't that the HBO one.

232
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,430
I think so I remember that.
I was like,

233
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,620
why is this on Hbo?
What are they doing?

234
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:29,340
Like,
what is this?

235
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,370
She strikes me as a pretty cool person.
I don't know for sure and I think she's 

236
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,390
attracted people.
Like,

237
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,230
I think it was a bummer that people made
so much.

238
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,830
Monomer dare bowl to you.
I don't mind a little.

239
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,940
Um,
I don't know man.

240
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:46,380
It's just wow.
Anti-Bullying has her first thing on her

241
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,240
twitter profile.
Wow.

242
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,030
Hmm.
Bullies in school,

243
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:54,990
bullied across the social scale.
Right.

244
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:57,090
So they don't believe the nerds.
They bully each other.

245
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,590
So if you're in there,
if you're,

246
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,940
if you're in a cool kid circle.
Apparently the bullies only bully.

247
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,690
That's what I read.

248
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,320
They bully each other because they know 
each other.

249
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,420
Truly.
Definitely blue people in other social 

250
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,461
circles to.
Although we're nerds bullying each 

251
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:13,461
other.
Yeah.

252
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:15,090
That's ridiculous.
Bullying among groups,

253
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:20,091
but they don't really.
There's not a whole lot of cross 

254
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:20,091
pollination.
But then again,

255
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:24,021
that's a dumb fucking know.
I read an article and I don't go to 

256
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:24,750
schools and you know,
draw lines on that.

257
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,660
There were a lot of things that are hard
to figure out right there.

258
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,670
A lot of things were here.
Like you can draw these broad based 

259
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:32,670
conclusions.
Like I went,

260
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,770
I read one article in New York Times 
about how doctors are in the pockets of 

261
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,611
pharmaceutical companies and the reps 
are cheerleaders and I got a fucking 

262
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:44,721
email from this guy who was a former 
green beret friend of Tim Kennedy's and 

263
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:44,721
he goes,
hey dude,

264
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:44,721
just say,
you know,

265
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:45,570
I sell drugs to doctors.

266
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,780
Nothing.
That's just not fucking true.

267
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,870
Like I'm just telling you like the 
reality on the ground versus what you're

268
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:55,030
reading from the New York Times is so 
diametrically opposed.

269
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,220
It's ridiculous.
Well,

270
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:01,230
in his circumstance,
but he's one guy working for one 

271
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,110
pharmaceutical company.
Industry is gigantic.

272
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:04,840
It's huge and it's practices vary 
widely,

273
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,270
especially depending upon what drugs 
you're selling.

274
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,340
My wife's mom is a nurse and she used to
work with pharmaceutical companies.

275
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:17,341
They would take them out to a steak 
dinner with them and they would 

276
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:20,700
literally do everything they could to 
get you to be like super high on that 

277
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,541
company and it's what they do to gain 
influence without actually paying you to

278
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,770
say shit to the patients.
You know,

279
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:28,180
like say if there's a company that you 
like,

280
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,570
like this hat I'm wearing vortex optics,
nice people.

281
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:32,880
They make good binoculars,
right?

282
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,250
So if I,
I meet them and I know them and I talk 

283
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:38,620
about them and I talk about them to 
other people,

284
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,390
people perhaps we'll buy their stuff.

285
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,900
Well,
the same kind of shit happens in,

286
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,450
in the pharmaceutical world.
They use influence.

287
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,140
They become friends with these nurses.
They buy them nice dinners.

288
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:52,540
They take them out for drinks to pick up
the tab.

289
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,130
Wow.
We had a nice dinner.

290
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:56,200
I didn't have to pay anything.
It's all against the law now,

291
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,400
I believe.
Is it?

292
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,490
Yes.
Now I think that there are a lot of 

293
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:02,490
strident laws are stringent laws,
whatever,

294
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,471
against sort of influence peddling and 
getting gifts even in the form of any 

295
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:09,670
kind of a trip,
any kind of a dinner.

296
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,520
A lot of that stuff is there's a wall 
now beings.

297
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,550
What's the super good idea?
But people are so open to suggestion 

298
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,020
that it should be absolutely illegal to 
advertise drugs.

299
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Well,
how about the fact that pharmaceutical 

300
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,200
companies are bankrolling,
you know,

301
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,020
scientists,
food companies,

302
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:28,690
bankroll scientists to do research on,
you know,

303
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,550
on simple sugars and how your diet can 
be made if 25 percent simple sugars,

304
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,900
you know,
according to our side is that I happen 

305
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:38,900
to also be on the Coca Cola,
Nestle,

306
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:38,900
kraft payroll.

307
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,830
Are you talking about the 1950 studies 
that I'm talking about now?

308
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:46,831
I'm talking about recently I'm talking 
about the fact that the food and board 

309
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:47,670
nutrition,
the food and nutrition board or whatever

310
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,760
the,
the bodies of government that set the 

311
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,030
nutritional standards for what mothers 
with dependent children eat,

312
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:57,700
what the military is,
what our school programs are.

313
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,180
Take a look at what their nutritional 
guidelines are and take a look at the 

314
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,711
corporations,
the people that are actually providing 

315
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:07,960
the food.
Who has a huge interest in that?

316
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,110
Nestle kraft,
these companies that make billions,

317
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,420
millions of billions of dollars on 
feeding our school children in public 

318
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,420
schools,
right?

319
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,000
Is there really a statement that says 25
percent simple sugars.

320
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,450
If you read forks over knives by t dot 
Colin Campbell,

321
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,780
he talks about the food and board 
nutrition and he's a scientist.

322
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,900
He's a Vegan and board nutrition,
the food and nutrition board.

323
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,250
I think that's what called food 
nutrition board,

324
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,870
but he,
I can't remember,

325
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,360
don't quote me exactly,
but you know,

326
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,000
he does a very good job of tracing the 
genealogy here.

327
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,710
He's a Vegan,
so I don't really agree with him,

328
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:43,711
but he's,
he does an amazing job of kind of 

329
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,850
showing you just exactly how the big 
food companies are very influential.

330
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,090
Do you know how much their products into
the mouths and Belize of people who are 

331
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,700
relying on the government to feed them 
too much?

332
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:54,350
That infuriates vegans and he said,
well,

333
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,170
he's a Vegan,
so I don't really agree with them.

334
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:56,830
I was like,
well,

335
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,110
yeah,
I mean he's,

336
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,080
he's at scientology does an amazing job 
though.

337
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Uh,
and in that book of making the argument 

338
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,961
for being healthier as a Vegan,
he talks about the China study where 

339
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:12,330
study has been widely debunked.
Right.

340
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,520
You know,
the China study,

341
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:18,521
apparently they didn't do a good job of 
pull up China study debunk so we can get

342
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:23,891
this totally accurate,
but I think essentially big part of his 

343
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:23,891
book.

344
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:23,891
Yeah.
Well,

345
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:27,740
so it was a lot of parts of,
a lot of the ways people were a managing

346
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:28,700
the nutrition.
Well,

347
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:33,701
he doesn't know he didn't,
he never talked about things like 

348
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,560
insulin and he doesn't come from.
It's not that scientific because you 

349
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,410
know,
insulin is a big thing to talk about,

350
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:39,740
like how food reacts to kind of hormonal
response food has on your body.

351
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,840
What dietary cholesterol really does,
you know,

352
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,900
um,
all the combination,

353
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,380
the correct combination should be all 
healthy thing,

354
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,330
breast and piece.
Trying to study.

355
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:55,331
Okay.
This is Chris Kresser who's actually 

356
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:55,331
been on the podcast.
Huh?

357
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:58,040
I'm Bubba.
Bubba bomb.

358
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,530
The China study should be put the issue 
to rest.

359
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:02,270
Please consider the information 
presented here.

360
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,920
The methodologies.
Impressive.

361
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,060
Okay.
Scroll down.

362
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,660
Papa.
Papa Campbell recommends a Vegan Diet.

363
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,720
No animal based food at all.
He claimed that population studies 

364
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,171
demonstrate that Vegan populations do 
not suffer from the high incidence of 

365
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:20,591
cardiovascular disease and cancer that 
we in the West do with our diets heavy 

366
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:21,230
on animal protein.

367
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,190
He also draws a correlation between,
if I remember correctly,

368
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:28,310
milk and juvenile diabetes.
I mean,

369
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:33,311
he draws all these correlations to even 
chronic illnesses that manifest 

370
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,190
themselves in children with meat and 
dairy.

371
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,330
This is Chris' master John's,
um,

372
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,580
take on a says.
When I first started analyzing the 

373
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,071
original China study data,
I had no intention of writing up an 

374
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,400
actual critique of Campbell's much 
lauded book.

375
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Uh,
I am a data junkie numbers along with 

376
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:54,840
the strawberries and Aubrey Hepburn 
films.

377
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,090
Gay make me very happy girl.
It's girl.

378
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,480
Oh,
okay.

379
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,550
Mainly wanting to see myself a see for 
myself how closely Campbell's claims 

380
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,210
aligned with the data's he drew from,
if only to satisfy my own curiosity,

381
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,160
but after spending a solid month and a 
half of reading,

382
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:10,580
graphing,
sticky noting and passing out a 3:00

383
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,580
AM from studious exhaustion.
And upon my copy of the Raw China state 

384
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,870
study data,
I've decided that it's time to voice all

385
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,950
my criticisms and there are many,
uh,

386
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,040
okay,
bup,

387
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,430
bup,
bup,

388
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,030
bup,
bup,

389
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,510
Campbell.

390
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,090
Conveniently fist to mention the county 
of tool toil in China.

391
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,890
The folks in two D,
Two l,

392
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,280
I 45 percent of their diet is fat,
134 grams of animal protein each day,

393
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:42,281
twice as much as the average American 
and rarely ate vegetables or other 

394
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:42,281
plants,
plant foods,

395
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:45,170
yet according to the and study.
And they were extremely healthy with low

396
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:46,700
rates of cancer and heart disease.
All right,

397
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,840
there you go.
He,

398
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,600
this is the problem,
the China study is that they only put in

399
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,680
stuff that backs up what they're saying.
Yeah.

400
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,010
And they'd confirmation bias.
Exactly.

401
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,450
So they didn't put in anything that is 
contrary to that data.

402
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,750
And there's plenty of that.
There's plenty of that out there.

403
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,570
I really honestly believe that the two 
co,

404
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,980
the real problem is the ideology because
the vegans are absolutely not able to 

405
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:16,740
get over the idea that you should ever 
eat or kill an animal should do no harm.

406
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,740
Right?
Well one day we're going to have this 

407
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,170
factory made meat.
It's on the way.

408
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,370
I mean they're really close to being 
able to do that in mass and when they do

409
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:31,371
that,
if they can get factory made meat and 

410
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:33,921
factory made fat and if it turns out in 
any way to actually be like the same 

411
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:36,000
thing,
like you can eat it and it's healthy.

412
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,970
Vegans should eat it because it's better
for you.

413
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,500
Yes.
It's more nutrition.

414
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:45,501
I understand.
If you would think that you can get all 

415
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:45,501
of your food from plants and you kind of
can,

416
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:50,330
you kind of can.
But there's been some real good 

417
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:50,520
scientific critiques of the problem with
Vegan diets.

418
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:51,750
Yes.
Yes.

419
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,380
That happened.
And,

420
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:57,381
and uh,
like a Charles pollock said he's been a 

421
00:18:57,381 --> 00:19:00,531
strength coach forever and he was on Tim
Ferriss' podcast and he said that they 

422
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:00,960
said if you ever look what about Vegan 
diets?

423
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,980
You've been strength training for 37 
years and you know,

424
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,660
high level has got more gold medalists 
under his,

425
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,620
you know,
toodle edge or whatever that he,

426
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:12,230
he's,
he's results driven guy.

427
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:12,770
Right,
right.

428
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,760
And that is so funny.
I said,

429
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:16,520
what do you think of Vegan?
Because he gained me.

430
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,980
He basically gave me nuts,
berries and some vegetables and he said,

431
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,770
after 37 years,
he goes,

432
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,410
I've never seen it.
I've never seen it.

433
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,470
I've never seen anybody on a vegetable 
based diet actually be able to compete 

434
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,110
in strength,
explosion,

435
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,160
those kinds of things to the level that 
others have.

436
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,270
Vegan power lifter in the Olympics.
So that doesn't make any sense.

437
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,200
And then there's,
ah,

438
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,030
there's other vegans,
strong men.

439
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,580
I know there's some guy who's,
I'm sure.

440
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,930
I'm sure there are.
I'm sure there are.

441
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,870
I'm just saying that,
you know,

442
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,570
according to polyclinic for the most 
part,

443
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:50,571
his athletes,
he thinks have to eat meat because it 

444
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:50,820
creates a more better for recovery 
benefits,

445
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,320
strength better for all that stuff.

446
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,940
I'm sure that is dependent entirely on 
the athlete because I think there's some

447
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:59,610
vegans that will tell you that they do a
Vegan diet and they feel better.

448
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,310
I know John Fitch did a Vegan diet for a
while,

449
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,330
but then he felt weak.
Just got to a point where you see,

450
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,360
this is one of the things that Chris 
Kresser talked about on the podcast as 

451
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,211
well,
that there's some initial positive 

452
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:14,211
benefits from changing your diet to a 
nutrient rich,

453
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:14,910
rich,
dense,

454
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,080
nutrient dense diet like a vegan diet as
opposed to the standard American diet.

455
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,440
The problem arises after years of living
like this where your body is just 

456
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,730
depleted itself of the things that are 
lacking in the Diet.

457
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,370
Now a smart vegan would tell you,
well,

458
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:34,371
that could be mitigated by better 
planning of your meals and making sure 

459
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:35,610
that you get all these healthy things.

460
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,010
That's true.
That is absolutely true.

461
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,160
And adding things like a.
what's that stuff from the green stuff 

462
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:46,110
from the ocean allergy.
Yeah.

463
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,350
Allergy.
Which you can get [inaudible] from 

464
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,350
allergy,
which is essentially sort of.

465
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,350
Look,
it's all life,

466
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,320
you know,
it's just we're deciding what's stupid.

467
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,420
If you really want to eat,
you should eat clams.

468
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,340
Clams are dumb as fuck.
He,

469
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,240
those stupid,
central nervous,

470
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,620
nothing.
I mean you might as well be eating 

471
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:04,620
carrot.
It's like you could eat things.

472
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,140
We have this weird thing about stuff 
that moves where you eat a venus fly 

473
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,730
trap.
Or do you draw the line that I will also

474
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:10,540
donate animals.
Talk to.

475
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,650
I mean,
plants talk to each other.

476
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:14,080
Don't trees have conversations with.
They do.

477
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,210
I would love to have a Venus fly trap 
salad.

478
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,660
Now that I'm thinking,
dude,

479
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,660
I tell you what,
man,

480
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:23,410
I went to there.

481
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,420
It's funny how some plants,
you know,

482
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:30,421
where there's shit in the.
They say you can almost eat anything in 

483
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:30,421
the ocean.
Uh,

484
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:31,990
with scales and fins,
like whatever it is.

485
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:36,991
You can eat shrimp,
you can eat almost anything with their 

486
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:36,991
certain like,
you know,

487
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,670
but when you go down,
I was in Tahiti,

488
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:42,030
which is considered the safest ocean to 
swimming.

489
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,780
Swimming.
There's,

490
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,470
yeah,
there's nothing really poisons to have a

491
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,930
rockfish and there aren't even a sea 
snakes.

492
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,360
I don't believe there aren't big sharks.
I mean it's like really,

493
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:54,361
really safe,
but there are always these poisonous 

494
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:55,870
corals,
these little things.

495
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:58,540
I went scuba diving and the woman with 
me,

496
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,970
uh,
just nicked her arm,

497
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:05,971
like the back of her arm on a,
on a piece of coral and man did that 

498
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:05,971
thing.
It just,

499
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:07,380
it didn't swell up like big.
But if she was just like,

500
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,150
this really hurts and all she did was 
just kind of brushed by.

501
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,920
And the first thing the guy told me he's
from,

502
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,410
from dad goes,
number one rule,

503
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,630
he said,
you look with your,

504
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,870
uh,
you touch with your eyes and you look 

505
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:21,870
with your fingers.
How's that sound?

506
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,930
I was like,
don't touch anything if I let you touch 

507
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:25,930
it,
that's my.

508
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,360
But otherwise please stay away from it.
And at one point were down there,

509
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,540
went down there and he starts clicking 
his fingers under water.

510
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,310
This is like 80 feet under.
It's going like this.

511
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:33,820
I'm like,
what?

512
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:38,821
He's done and then nothing happens.
And he's like doing it toward this 

513
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:42,121
choral thing.
So I think something's going to jump 

514
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:42,121
out.
And then he takes a piece of coral,

515
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:45,991
picks it up and he digs into the ground 
and out comes a what I thought was a 

516
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,920
piece of rock.
It was a rockfish.

517
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,110
Whoa.
Which good luck.

518
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,340
Step on that.
See what happens.

519
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,110
Tell me how things work out for you.
Stick ahead.

520
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,890
Step out at rockfish and cover with 
quills and shit.

521
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,610
Try not to go into shock by the way.

522
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,810
Especially 80 feet under.
That's not a good time.

523
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Yeah.
But the problem is that you walk and it 

524
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,690
looks exactly like a rock.
And if you're walking around in like a,

525
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:12,691
you know,
kind of you down there in the ocean or 

526
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:12,691
you know,
you walk on that,

527
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,060
you can get one of those foot and phone 
call dot.

528
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,330
Yeah.
And they don't really have an antivenom 

529
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,330
for you.
You gotTa,

530
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,830
you gotTa let it work through your body 
fucker.

531
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,180
They met.
Yeah.

532
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:25,380
I don't know if that's a rockfish,
but it will back rockfish.

533
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,570
Show him the other one.
There's one that looks like exactly like

534
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:33,571
a stone that was not the one was one 
that literally looks like that right 

535
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:34,750
there.
That bad.

536
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:35,370
Boy,
that's what I say.

537
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,830
Oh yeah,
that does look like a rock when his eyes

538
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,510
are closed.
Here's the weird thing,

539
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:41,210
man,
like what?

540
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,950
What the fuck information is being 
passed from animal to animal and from 

541
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,821
nature to animal that allows these 
simple animals like a fish to just 

542
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:56,540
change its body shape over time.
It's evolution.

543
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,970
It's exactly like um,
you know,

544
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:02,180
when you train a united a whale or you 
train a bear.

545
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,700
So if you want to bear to get up on its 
hind legs.

546
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,280
So what are they driven by?
They're driven by food,

547
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,500
right?
So every time a bear sits up,

548
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,430
you give them,
you click,

549
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,040
you click a thing and you give them a.
I'm not a bear trainer,

550
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,570
but you pick her train.
Yeah,

551
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,940
I mean honestly,
secretly,

552
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,350
apparently got some,
I got some hidden skills,

553
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,360
right?
Okay.

554
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,510
You go and you give it to him and then 
when he gets up on his hind legs,

555
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:28,511
maybe you go,
you click the thing and you give them a 

556
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:28,511
treat and then that's.

557
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:31,900
And,
and you give them a signal for when you 

558
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,641
want that to happen and pretty soon you 
will allow him to kind of make the 

559
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:36,581
choice to go up.
And he knows that when I go up and my 

560
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:36,581
hindquarters,
good things happen.

561
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:36,860
I get a,
I get a little treat,

562
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:41,861
right?
Say trend you don't train to bear by 

563
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:41,861
going bad bear and hitting him on the 
nose.

564
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:42,740
Good luck.
See what happens to your fucking face.

565
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,730
Right?
You do it,

566
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,350
you know,
you work with the animals and nature.

567
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,080
And I think evolution probably was the 
same way.

568
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:50,840
The fish that looked a little bit more 
like a rock,

569
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,880
you know,
a couple of those survived,

570
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:53,510
right?
Yeah.

571
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,750
Like when I was in bed,
I was in this uh,

572
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,010
because survival is a motherfucker,
right?

573
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,620
I listened to Ed and they had this 
incredible,

574
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,600
uh,
it's where all the sea turtles would lay

575
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,030
their eggs and we would watch them 
hatch.

576
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,240
And all these adorable little babies 
would run down to the ocean everyday 

577
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,620
like woo.
And all of us would be sitting there 

578
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:14,620
going,
Yay.

579
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:14,620
And the kids were like,
look how cute they are.

580
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,820
And stuff like that and as I'm watching 
them and there's so many of them,

581
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,900
I go,
there's so many.

582
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:19,310
And he goes,
there are and,

583
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,510
and my daughter's like,
he's so cute and so because you've got 

584
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,060
to hold one before it went down there 
and he looks at me and he goes,

585
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,240
1000 Sarah by one in 1000 that's just 
cheese,

586
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,820
that's just food for the,
for the bay right now.

587
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,000
And he said,
I said,

588
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,590
what do you mean?
He goes,

589
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,800
they're just nothing but baby sharks 
groupers and even big crabs waiting for 

590
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,690
every single one of them and one in a 
thousand turtles I going to live.

591
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,600
And then I whispered that to my 
daughter.

592
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,600
So she understands what fucking life is 
really about while you whispered in a 

593
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,890
creepy way or real quick to assume that,
but you think they're cute.

594
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,280
It's got about 10,
10 minutes to look to is that water is 

595
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,440
kind of fucked.
It's like they make food.

596
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,810
Hey my little food factories,
if they would make a thousand of them,

597
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,380
I mean how many do they make?
How many?

598
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:13,030
Probably 100 eggs.
So then there's like 100 of them in any 

599
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,940
10 x 10 nests and that's one survives.
So when you see a big turtle,

600
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,790
you know,
and when you eat turtle soup,

601
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,690
remember that I don't eat turtle soup 
or.

602
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,080
Well they do in Japan was in Hawaii and 
uh,

603
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:24,770
the,
the,

604
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:25,670
uh,
the big island,

605
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:30,671
the turtles just chill on the shore and 
just hanging out there and signs saying 

606
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:31,790
don't starve them.
So cool.

607
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:36,791
Yeah,
it was at a resort and people just walk 

608
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:36,791
by them.

609
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:36,791
It really was to be included,
the turtles,

610
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:39,620
but it's just,
you're looking at this crazy life form.

611
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,350
You're so used to it that it just seems 
normal.

612
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,340
Oh,
there's a turtle.

613
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,660
Oh look,
it's a turtle.

614
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,220
But then if you take yourself out of 
that context of familiarity and you,

615
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:51,040
you,
you just,

616
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,680
just get a look at what that life form 
is like.

617
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,500
That thing is a shield on its back and 
it sucks.

618
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:03,510
It's grotty into this hard case and it's
swimming around in the ocean.

619
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,620
It's living out there going under and 
then it comes up on the beach too.

620
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:10,140
It does whatever the fuck it was when we
were done scuba diving,

621
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:12,750
we saw this pot of beautiful little 
dolphins,

622
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,030
bottlenose porpoises,
but the kind of dolphins,

623
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:20,031
a little gray ones you see that jump out
of the that you swim with and it was a 

624
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:20,910
group of them and they swim with the 
boat.

625
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,970
They live,
they know you're there and they'll swim 

626
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,771
with you and they swim at the boat and 
they jump out of the air and they flip 

627
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,620
and they're literally showing off here.
There's no question about it.

628
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:30,150
Right.
And I said to the guy,

629
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,190
I wish we'd seen them when we're scuba 
diving.

630
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,250
I could've played with one and he said,
you would never see them when you're 

631
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:37,250
scuba diving.
I see.

632
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:37,380
What do you mean?
They're right there.

633
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:39,420
And he said,
they don't like the bubbles.

634
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,960
They wouldn't come near you.
And it freaked me out.

635
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,680
I don't know.
And he went,

636
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,810
by the way,
he was French and he said it in French,

637
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:51,050
but I like being theatrical because he 
was really creepy and on the back of my 

638
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:51,110
neck.
Oh,

639
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,400
it was breathing and he was wearing.
What the fuck was he doing behind me?

640
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:53,670
I don't know.

641
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,370
I was drunk.
I drank too much.

642
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,490
I know.
No was to hate him and I just wanted to 

643
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:01,650
come clean to Tahiti.
Dude,

644
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,710
we were in Tahiti.
It's not gave us to Haiti and it's not 

645
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:06,710
safe.
I'm not looking him in the face to heat.

646
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,310
We just get crazy and said.
And he was like new,

647
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,270
small,
new small.

648
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,770
Won't beat the hood.
Got It.

649
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,660
Have you ever seen a crocodile turtle?
No,

650
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,690
but I'd like to bring that up.
They just chew them up really like 

651
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,300
nothing.
They just to read through the terrific.

652
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,490
Oh,
crocodiles are fucking horrific.

653
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,860
They can,
they have acid in their stomach.

654
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:31,350
They can break down fucking anything.
Anything.

655
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,090
License plates.
Horns.

656
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,080
I'm going to eat.
Look at this.

657
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,750
Well,
this,

658
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,860
this is an alligator.
This isn't even a big one,

659
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:42,460
but this is good enough.
I didn't find one.

660
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,370
There's a,
there's a video of a crock.

661
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,330
They look at the right there,
right there.

662
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:46,830
Were there,
there,

663
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,420
third down,
third down on a table.

664
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:52,330
And alligators.
They're incredible.

665
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,420
Um,
well guess what?

666
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:58,240
It's turtles fucks Ville.
Well now hold on.

667
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,240
It doesn't seem like it's going to break
through that shell though.

668
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,440
No.
This one,

669
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,500
it seems like it's a little too small.
The one that I saw was a crocodile and 

670
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,680
so it was a really big animal and 
mashing this turtle,

671
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,950
that's a waiting game.
He's not strong enough to do it.

672
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:19,951
He's too stupid to.
He used to run to run it fairly slathers

673
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,390
away.
Look at it.

674
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,660
Oh my God.
What a creepy animal that just live big 

675
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,750
ass reptile.
Fuck him.

676
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,040
He's going to swallow them whole.
Nah,

677
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,790
no,
Nah.

678
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,280
Is a wash.
He's not getting this one.

679
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,870
Definitely choke on that thing.
Yeah.

680
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:40,360
He's not getting this one is so geared 
trying.

681
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,030
Yeah,
look it.

682
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,970
It's got no brain.
Look at that as a brand.

683
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:43,870
The alligator,
you know,

684
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,670
when you hunt for alligators,
you know what you have to do.

685
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
See that thing right behind their head.
He dressed up like a sweet shoot it 

686
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,060
where like you see his,
his,

687
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:54,310
uh,
his eyeballs back up a little bit.

688
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,690
The plate behind his head.
It's like right behind his eyeballs.

689
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,130
I would go for right there.
Right at that spot.

690
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,930
Right there.
That's where you want to work crocodile.

691
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,210
Dundee stabbed the fucker when it 
grabbed the girl.

692
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,680
That fucking happened.
Yup.

693
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,110
Does it?
They're so creepy.

694
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,680
I read that a guy got bit by a 
crocodile,

695
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,580
not a big one,
and he reached behind the clock.

696
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,590
I stuck his hand up the things ass and 
pulled whatever he could out and the 

697
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,530
crocodile let go of him.
What?

698
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,150
I'll say it again.
He reached into his ass.

699
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,560
He reached into a task.
Now I don't know if that's possible.

700
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,570
Let's just map.
This is the world where it crushes the 

701
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:32,570
shells.
Oh,

702
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,570
is that an alligator?
It looks like it looks like an 

703
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:36,570
alligator.
That looks like a crock.

704
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:36,830
Oh yeah.
This one.

705
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,540
I believe they have the strongest bite.
The American alligator to smashing right

706
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:43,150
through it.

707
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,160
I hope that's not the turtle.
It is.

708
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,500
Make that noise before.
No,

709
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:52,300
but look at the blood.
That's the noise.

710
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:53,950
The turtles making that noise because 
it's killing it.

711
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,920
Holy Shit.
This is exactly.

712
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:01,921
The video is talking about looking at 
how are you going to eat the shell and 

713
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:04,420
everything.
Look at it just keeps crushing.

714
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,720
What a monster.
This thing is.

715
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,180
Come on Jamie.
Jamie fucked up.

716
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,320
I don't want to hear sounds of turtles 
being tortured,

717
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:18,010
but look,
I don't,

718
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:23,011
but I do.
Look at how it just crushing it's body 

719
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:25,420
sane.
That didn't look at his eyes.

720
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,720
Just stupid fucking eating machine.
Yep.

721
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,040
A dinosaur.
That's a straight up dinosaur,

722
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,850
huh?
I mean we'd say stupid,

723
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,880
but you know,
there's obviously the capacity for being

724
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:43,630
even interested in anything.
The giant Crocs I guess lose their teeth

725
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:48,631
by the time they're like 40,
I'm sure and I'm sure that things are 

726
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:49,420
going to lose his teeth to title they 
fight.

727
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,090
Other crux,
they get a giant mouth fights.

728
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,210
It's interesting.
We mean the thing serves its purpose.

729
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,840
I mean there really is no need for books
really is.

730
00:31:57,841 --> 00:32:02,841
It's not.
It's not excited by intellectual 

731
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:03,590
discourse.
It's not here to diffusion of innovation

732
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,200
as a hunter would say.
It's not.

733
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,900
It's a movement of ideas here for any of
that.

734
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,420
It's here for fucking up everything that
he can eat.

735
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,160
Yeah.
That's what it's there for.

736
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,420
It's because people and things and 
turtles like to fuck.

737
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,790
And if they like to fuck,
they make too many of them.

738
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:21,550
So we have to have around crocodiles and
alligators.

739
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:26,551
Yeah.
And Lions and everything else that eats 

740
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:26,620
shit driven by one driven by certain 
things.

741
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,660
We're so we're so detached from that 
world I think.

742
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,370
I think that's um,
that's the function and the sort of,

743
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,010
the biggest difference between what it 
is to be human.

744
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,180
There's a fundamental difference,
you know,

745
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:46,280
human beings who was thinking about how 
we create beauty for its own sake,

746
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,780
what,
why,

747
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:53,230
you know,
a lot of times even at our own expense 

748
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,230
at that famous,
whether it's true or not,

749
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,741
the legend of Michelangelo Painting the 
Sistine Chapel and going blind because 

750
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,720
the paint was in his eyes inspired by 
something bigger than himself.

751
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,920
Paint above them.
He definitely,

752
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,980
I mean,
that's like the historical record is now

753
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:04,760
part of that.
This,

754
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,140
you know,
people just went blind,

755
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,000
blamed it on the paint when,
well,

756
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,130
he was on his back for a long time,
but they said,

757
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,180
you know,
sometimes,

758
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:16,181
well,
human beings have this need to be 

759
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:16,181
immortal,
right?

760
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:18,371
We want to leave a mark,
whether it's to our children or through 

761
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:18,371
our work.
That's a very deep,

762
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:22,190
deep drive.
But I don't like as I get older,

763
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:23,860
I don't like just,
you know,

764
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,780
breaking it down to simple constructs 
like that.

765
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:32,020
Maybe because I'm a romantic,
I'd rather believe that we have 

766
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,400
something inherent in us that is a,
this just,

767
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,580
I don't know what it is.
Maybe an inherent inspiration,

768
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,450
a nostalgia to create something that's 
much bigger than ourselves.

769
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,330
That's,
that,

770
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,890
that moves people to tears,
brings them to their knees,

771
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,190
uh,
drops their jaw and all that stuff.

772
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,050
Is that,
that's what I think is fascinating.

773
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:56,051
Like I was,
I'm writing then back then it was the 

774
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:59,231
only way to leave that mark to.
You have to understand the context of 

775
00:33:59,231 --> 00:33:59,231
the time.
Yes.

776
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:00,170
If you think about today,
you could write a book,

777
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,900
you could make a movie,
you could fucking do a comedy show,

778
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:04,640
you could do this,
you could do with that.

779
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,040
You.
There's so many different avenues,

780
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,740
but I'm talking also about.
I wonder if animals feel like,

781
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:14,741
for example,
when you listen to a beautiful piece of 

782
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:14,741
music,
right,

783
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:16,070
and you're driving down the road and you
have.

784
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,160
Have you ever had that feeling where you
like you go.

785
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,350
It's a feeling of inspiration,
right?

786
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,510
So you kind of feel really sad,
really happy.

787
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:24,740
You want.
I love everybody.

788
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,510
You know,
that feeling of wonder.

789
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,390
I wonder if animals have anything like 
that.

790
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,520
There's no need for it.
They don't have communication,

791
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:36,521
so if you don't have communication,
they probably don't have these crazy 

792
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:37,630
weird fluctuations of their intent and 
their,

793
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,940
their,
their lusts and desires and their,

794
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,800
their,
their path is probably much,

795
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,570
much straighter and trauma.
Yeah.

796
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,370
It a lot of ways.
I don't know,

797
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:48,590
man,
a lot of intellectual masturbation,

798
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:53,591
I guess the end of the day,
but it just seems like I'm the only 

799
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:58,601
things that have that capacity are 
humans and maybe dolphins and orcas and 

800
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:00,850
whales.
Whales,

801
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,520
yeah.
They seem to have really strong bonds 

802
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
with their family and they do 
communicate that.

803
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,410
Telecom,
is that how you say his name,

804
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:12,050
the one that died in San Diego?
Was it a guy or girl?

805
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,420
Good girl.
Oh yeah,

806
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,870
there was a guy who was the guy.
Yeah.

807
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,330
Yeah,
that will from black fish is dead now.

808
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:22,390
Thirty five years old.
They lived to be 80 plus and the wild 

809
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,060
folks find that acceptable.
That's a.

810
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:28,061
that's a living thing that is probably 
as smart as your fucking neighbor and 

811
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:32,341
it's locked in a swimming tank in San 
Diego and it's fucked and now it's dead 

812
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,230
and that thing bread in the wild.
It made.

813
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,550
I don't remember many slave

814
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,520
babies,
but that's essentially what it made.

815
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:43,620
A bunch of slaves.
It's fucked.

816
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,230
It's seaworld.
No longer doing that.

817
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,390
Now.
They should be in jail.

818
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,670
They should be arrested.
You,

819
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,870
you're.
You're slaving intelligent beings.

820
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,640
They just can't talk to you in a way 
that you should understand.

821
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,670
You can understand.
Right?

822
00:35:57,671 --> 00:36:02,671
So you're profiting off of enslaving 
intelligent beings and making them do 

823
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:04,320
flips.
This is a 1950.

824
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,740
We know what the fuck a dolphin is.
We know what an Orca.

825
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:09,090
It's,
you know,

826
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:14,091
if you.
If you are a person that is breeding 

827
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,090
those things in captivity,
keeping them in swimming pools.

828
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,200
It's crazy that it's legal.
What's funny is I didn't know anything I

829
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:21,330
never thought about that,
didn't know that,

830
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:26,331
didn't think that would have told you.
They were probably very happy until 

831
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:27,780
blackfish came out,
which I didn't even see because I didn't

832
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:28,320
want to say it.

833
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,190
I've had this kid filled demars on my 
podcast a couple times now and he's from

834
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,190
marine land.
He.

835
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,920
He got fired from Greenland and he has 
gone like way of his way to expo.

836
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:42,921
It's in Canada to expose all of these 
violations of animal welfare and animal 

837
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:51,321
safety and all the fucking horrible 
practices that this place now they're 

838
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:56,091
being brought up on charges.
They were just recently brought up on 

839
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:56,091
more charges.
Like He.

840
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,290
He tweeted something about it just a 
couple of days ago,

841
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:01,630
marine brought up on charges,
but he was a walrus trainer there,

842
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:06,830
this named smooshy and he developed this
really close bond with this walrus that 

843
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,260
he was training,
but he was like,

844
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:12,261
this place is fucked.
Like they don't give a shit about these 

845
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:15,261
things.
They don't give a shit about these 

846
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:15,261
animals.
And he's like,

847
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:15,261
and they were getting their dolphins and
their orchestra.

848
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:19,560
They're getting them from these Russian 
ships that brokers get them from China.

849
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,570
Yeah,
we're inland faces.

850
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:24,140
Six new animal cruelty charges.
Yeah.

851
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,910
Fuck up close.
Well,

852
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,050
the one for me,
seeing how small the tank was for killer

853
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:32,880
whale to swimming,
the charges are related to the treatment

854
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:36,180
of an elk or red deer in a fallow deer.
What?

855
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,280
They have tears roaming around there.

856
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,890
Whatever your theme,
less sympathetic to make smart.

857
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,210
Well,
the whole thing is just.

858
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,420
It's insane that it is legal to keep 
dolphins and orcas captive is insane and

859
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,700
whales too,
but obviously we are the two big.

860
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,980
It's insane.
It's.

861
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,170
They're so fucking smart,
man.

862
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,220
If you've seen the image of a Dolphin's 
brain right next to a human's brain,

863
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,670
their brains are bigger than ours,
like we don't know.

864
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,710
We have such a clearly defined standard 
for what we accept as intelligence.

865
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,630
Send me an email.
Where's your house?

866
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,830
You know,
uh,

867
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,750
how much do you make a year?
What do you do for a living?

868
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,430
If you're not,
if you don't have any of those things,

869
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:19,430
you're fucking barbarian.
You're,

870
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,240
you're,
you're not really a person.

871
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:22,290
Like,
look at that dolphin brain.

872
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,990
So he went to look at the 10 til is 
different,

873
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:25,320
right?
Yeah,

874
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:26,400
but it's,
it's not.

875
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:30,690
It's all within the confines of what we 
think of a civilization will.

876
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:32,430
All those things are meaningless to a 
dolphin.

877
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,320
They don't have fingers.
They don't need them.

878
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:36,220
They don't pick things there.
Moved to three

879
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,180
d space in this warm water.
They have free food everywhere.

880
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:43,060
They don't have any need for money.
There's no need for clothes.

881
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,130
So where does the mind go?
Then?

882
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:49,180
We'll see as the mind goes to comradery 
or culture or songs,

883
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,220
those dolphin songs that we don't 
understand.

884
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:52,630
What the fuck they are.
Who knows?

885
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:55,180
I mean,
maybe that's where their thought goes,

886
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,570
but what we do know is there's a lot of 
thinking going on.

887
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,550
This is not a piece of salary.
Yeah.

888
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,670
You know,
this is not an animal that should be 

889
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:05,670
kept in a,
in a pool.

890
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,431
No,
it's not even like animals that we 

891
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,660
really like it,
like a dog.

892
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:16,020
This is way smarter than me.
This is an animal that is used to jump 

893
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,001
through hoops literally and for fish and
to do twirls and stuff and to pull you 

894
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:23,920
along as you ride them.

895
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,300
Right?
Or want to scan them.

896
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,030
And if you take that out of the 
equation,

897
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:31,000
that seems to me to be where seaworld 
makes a lot of their money.

898
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,830
I've been to that show you.
Right.

899
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,000
So,
um,

900
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,760
and when I was watching that show and my
kids were all excited,

901
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:39,430
I never thought in any way it was 
cruelty to the animal.

902
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:41,710
I just didn't know.
It doesn't look like it.

903
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:42,380
Right.
Right.

904
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,450
And so,
uh,

905
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,340
but,
but I think we could do without.

906
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,760
We could probably do without though.
They say it raises awareness and stuff 

907
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,431
like that.
We'd probably do without bullshit 

908
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:53,431
documentaries,
raise awareness,

909
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:54,220
and that's why their business is down by
a massive,

910
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:56,290
massive amount.
That's why they're hurting.

911
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,250
Oh,
well yeah.

912
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,410
There's.
The stock didn't really suffer at first.

913
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:04,300
Did you see that after black fish stocks
stayed pretty strong for how long?

914
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:04,560
Up?

915
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,580
For about a year.
Maybe more.

916
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:08,710
Their stock was not.
It didn't take a hit,

917
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,920
and then I guess as time went on,
well,

918
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,950
people hear about it on the Internet.
They start exchanging information,

919
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:16,990
start reading about things that they're 
doing there.

920
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Start reading about how long the animals
live in the wild versus how long they 

921
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,071
live in captivity.
You see the dorsal fin that flops over 

922
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:27,070
because they.
They never have to deal with wave,

923
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:32,071
so it atrophies really ugly.
Other dorsal fin becomes like a limp 

924
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:33,790
Dick.
This flood is for.

925
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:36,150
It's for.
It's for steering through the water,

926
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,580
for handling waves and correcting your 
path,

927
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,360
your path.
So for them outside in the wild,

928
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:47,470
it's rigid and powerful,
but in this pool where there's no waves,

929
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:49,690
it never gets used,
so it flops over.

930
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,710
Damn.
Yeah.

931
00:40:50,711 --> 00:40:53,020
Have you ever seen that show showing an 
image of it?

932
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,400
It's fucking great.
I didn't see that.

933
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,370
I couldn't watch the documentary.
I was afraid it would make me.

934
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,650
It's like a guy doesn't.
He's not allowed to use his arm,

935
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:02,530
so his one arm that just withers and the
other arm is big.

936
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,390
Yeah.
I don't have any more to allow them.

937
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,520
Oh fuck.
Sales doorbells just flops over.

938
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:14,350
See how one in the wild as like this big
size of that rudder.

939
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,880
Yeah.
Well they need it.

940
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,440
You know what I mean?
They're dealing with waves.

941
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,840
You imagine it's ugly man.
It's an ugly practice and as much as 

942
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,270
those things do,
jump up on that platform and do get that

943
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:27,910
fish and do,
do the flips and make everybody happy.

944
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,420
It's fucked up.
And also I feel like if they really to 

945
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,351
have a relationship with these orcas,
the correct way to do it would be to 

946
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,780
have some sort of a meeting ground where
they meet these orchids and they get 

947
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,440
them to do things for fish.

948
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,280
They get them to do tricks.
I'll start.

949
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:50,870
So like an open area of the ocean can go
wherever the fuck they want,

950
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:53,150
but if they want to come back around and
hang out,

951
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,410
that makes sense.
You know,

952
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,720
like maybe we'll get to do an orchid 
show today,

953
00:41:56,721 --> 00:42:01,721
but maybe you won't.
But you know that having them in 

954
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:02,270
captivity and lifting up a cage and they
swim through and all that horseshit.

955
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,040
Yeah.
That's where it's fucked.

956
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,200
Does it?
Everything in the ocean fear the Orca.

957
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,790
I think pretty much they have to.
Even whites,

958
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,500
right?
Yeah.

959
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:14,501
They fuck great whites up.
They eat them because they said that 

960
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:17,441
they played,
I think Paul de Gelder who lost his arm 

961
00:42:17,441 --> 00:42:20,171
and his hand in his leg to a bull shark 
and Sydney Bay City Bay doing routine 

962
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,380
stuff.
And um,

963
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,840
is he the guy that has a carbon fiber 
right now?

964
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,820
Yeah.
And he's,

965
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,590
he's,
he's pretty cool.

966
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:30,360
He squeezed my hand hurt.
He couldn't really squeeze.

967
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,270
It's a $90,000
fake hand.

968
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,180
Well,
yeah.

969
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:38,650
And he squeezed it.
He was an Australian navy seal and it 

970
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,690
feels good to finger.
Somebody can't write.

971
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,080
I don't know.
Maybe that guy who was my scuba 

972
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,080
instructor will tell you.
I mean,

973
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,730
it just seems like.
I guarantee I guaran fucking tee.

974
00:42:49,731 --> 00:42:51,680
He's tried it,
I think at one point.

975
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,460
Yeah,
for sure.

976
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,980
He's a good looking guy and there's 
obviously girls are like,

977
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,620
well,
let's give it a shot.

978
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,330
Of course.
What?

979
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,320
You're not gonna you're not gonna play 
with the mechanical hand.

980
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:05,350
How long do for.
Do you think they have those Luke 

981
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,331
skywalker arms?
Remember when Luke Skywalker got that 

982
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:07,331
new alarm and it was dope,
like pretty immediately.

983
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,340
All I know is I've always been self 
conscious of my left arm.

984
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,230
Why?
Because I feel it's a little skinny.

985
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,380
Especially in using your right.
My right is fucking ridiculous.

986
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:18,500
Look at that shit.
But why is it different in my mind today

987
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:20,900
is I have weird shit about my body.
I have.

988
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,820
I have a weird thing about this side of 
my body,

989
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,220
my left side and serious.
I swear to God.

990
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,130
Here it is.
The Star Wars.

991
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:28,490
I remember this so well.
I remember this so well.

992
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,670
He could feel the nerves.
Yeah.

993
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,590
And you had to close it off.
That's amazing.

994
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,790
Yeah,
man,

995
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:40,150
you know,
it was a big consultant on these movies 

996
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,150
who,
Joseph Campbell.

997
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,810
Really?
He makes sense.

998
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,110
Yeah,
that makes sense.

999
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,480
Yeah.
For all the heroes journey,

1000
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,070
look at that.
Yeah,

1001
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:48,110
well that's common or what you're seeing
right there.

1002
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,080
Oh yeah,
it's coming.

1003
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,710
It's 50 years from now or eight years 
from now,

1004
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:54,260
whatever it is.
The real problem is going to be when are

1005
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:57,530
we just going to be like a spinal cord 
hooked up to all this stuff.

1006
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:03,130
Just going to keep replacing shit.
Like I've been to a lot of people that 

1007
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,570
have faked things like fake knees and 
fake shoulders and fake hips,

1008
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,060
but we like to come back and a lot of 
ways to,

1009
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,130
to the simplicity and the organic,
you know,

1010
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,800
like look at how the food movement,
you know,

1011
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,510
we like to eat on wood.
Nothing's really ever replaced.

1012
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:20,850
The feel of wood or courts or for.
Yes,

1013
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,900
true.
Synthetic synthetics have a limit.

1014
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:28,901
What was that thing about?
They were talking about something 

1015
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:31,010
fascinating about like there's a point 
where robots.

1016
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,560
Oh yeah,
the guy who created a coo.

1017
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,020
I scuba dive with a guy who is the owner
of I robot,

1018
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,160
right?
So they may call the,

1019
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,220
he builds robots,
went to mit and stuff like that.

1020
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,320
Really Smart Guy and said,
and I said,

1021
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:45,570
talk to me about sexual robots.
And they said,

1022
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:48,660
well of course I did because I like to 
get deep.

1023
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,250
Right?
He's this really smart guy.

1024
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:51,330
And I'm like,
what about,

1025
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:56,390
what about things that could fuck bro.
I know you got something to vacuum my 

1026
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,390
floor.
You got some,

1027
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,350
but my dick.
You got,

1028
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,130
you got something for my Dick.
Yeah,

1029
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:00,850
there's a little tiny drones are cute.
Yeah,

1030
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,960
it's cute.
I got to come.

1031
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:08,310
I'm looking to come in.
Drone drove and drunk and I said,

1032
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:10,080
what about cause you know,
it's coming.

1033
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,090
I said,
what about fucking a robot?

1034
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,040
And he said,
there's this,

1035
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,460
there's this weird situation where we 
call it the,

1036
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:22,770
uh,
I think it was the revulsion factor or 

1037
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:22,770
the,
the repulsive factor.

1038
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,631
So human beings,
you can get something really close and 

1039
00:45:26,631 --> 00:45:30,471
people will fuck it.
Like you can have like just a pocket 

1040
00:45:30,471 --> 00:45:30,471
pussy,
right?

1041
00:45:30,471 --> 00:45:33,711
A Guy I'll carry around just like a,
like a flashlight or a gel pussy and 

1042
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,770
bang it and in the bathroom and his 
office break right while he watches porn

1043
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:38,850
on his phone,
whatever it might be,

1044
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,950
but there's something about a robot when
you try to get it really human.

1045
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:48,560
He apparently from their research,
and I don't,

1046
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,330
I'm not saying this guy comes up with,
he's working on sexual robots,

1047
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:56,331
but like he said that you see there's 
something about creating a robot that's 

1048
00:45:56,331 --> 00:46:01,071
so human like,
but there's just something missing like 

1049
00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:03,900
the expression in the eyes or whatever 
and it gets to a point where you get it.

1050
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,140
When you get it as real as possible,
like,

1051
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,620
as real,
as real as possible.

1052
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,230
It people will fuck,
fuck,

1053
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:12,060
fuck.
And then when it gets so real,

1054
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:17,061
they'll go up.
It's not know you're trying to be too 

1055
00:46:17,061 --> 00:46:17,061
human.
Oh,

1056
00:46:17,061 --> 00:46:18,030
hold on.
You're trying to make eyes that don't.

1057
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,230
They're not.
Something's missing.

1058
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:20,570
Something's weird here.
Something and,

1059
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:23,070
and it.
And it apparently shuts people off right

1060
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,600
away.
It makes sense.

1061
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,090
It just would freak you out.
Yeah,

1062
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,470
I mean,
you know,

1063
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:30,570
it's not a person,
but it's so close.

1064
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,650
It's so close.
Yeah.

1065
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:33,420
Why?
Why would you get hard for that?

1066
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,670
That would be too weird.
Well,

1067
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,190
you would feel so strange if you fucked 
a robot for.

1068
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,290
You'd feel it.
Any moment.

1069
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:42,080
That thing could kill you.
Nobody ever.

1070
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,030
Exactly clear them and more importantly 
for choking you.

1071
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,500
But way more importantly is that more 
importantly,

1072
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,580
if you got lucky,
you got the lady thinking about fighting

1073
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:57,300
for my life against this robot.
I'm trying to fuck.

1074
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,430
Why don't we get low when we start 
talking about dirty shit.

1075
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,970
I Dunno why to talk like that when they 
want to be sexy.

1076
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,920
Yeah.
There's like things that don't work,

1077
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:08,430
but people do.
Like when you talk like this,

1078
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:09,890
it's scary.
No,

1079
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,430
it's not because that's not scary.
Like we've got it in our head.

1080
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,870
That's scary.
But he boys looking for company.

1081
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,090
Oh,
one 800 hot slowed.

1082
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,210
I just liked that.
You immediately,

1083
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:29,211
before we got to the factor that was a 
girl when I like strawberries and what 

1084
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:29,440
was the other thing?
Oh,

1085
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,990
something else.
First thing I did,

1086
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,400
I immediately.

1087
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:40,870
Yeah,
there's like certain signals that gay 

1088
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:40,870
guys will just throw up.
We'll know.

1089
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,520
Like,
I'm a huge share fan.

1090
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,380
Koto a Barbara streisand concert.
Gay is everywhere.

1091
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:47,920
Yeah,
well they have,

1092
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,080
you know,
it's one of the fun things I guess about

1093
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:52,210
being gay.
So they have these uh,

1094
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,860
female diva like idols that they 
worship,

1095
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,950
you know,
like shares a giant one in a billion 

1096
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:01,950
wicked thoughts.
They,

1097
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,170
uh,
it's a really great book written by two 

1098
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:07,170
neuroscientists.
Oh,

1099
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:07,170
you're telling me about that.
And,

1100
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,770
and the average gay penis is a half 
inch,

1101
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,980
half inch longer than the average 
straight pick penis and also the gay 

1102
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:14,260
brain apparently.
So,

1103
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:17,490
so the gay brain.
I know,

1104
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:18,960
I know I'm,
I'm,

1105
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,360
first of all,
I'm not affects at this time on the real

1106
00:48:21,361 --> 00:48:26,361
scientist.
I'm not a fixed that you can take 

1107
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:26,361
scientist out of that,
that phrase,

1108
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,490
but,
but what they found is that.

1109
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,510
So why,
why,

1110
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:33,511
why,
why all these men who love Barbra 

1111
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:33,511
streisand,
why are they mostly gay?

1112
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:33,550
Why?
Why?

1113
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,550
Right.
And there are,

1114
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,940
there are,
according to the research that I've done

1115
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:42,940
in my backyard and on this book,
which is a great book,

1116
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:43,580
uh,
and,

1117
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,860
and I got it from,
I think it was gad sad maybe who was 

1118
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:48,860
recommending or talking about it,
but no,

1119
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,930
it was Jordan Peterson,
so I read it,

1120
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,850
but you know,
there are,

1121
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:54,970
there are fundamental differences with 
the way the,

1122
00:48:55,090 --> 00:49:00,090
the man whose gaze brain reacts to 
certain things in relation to how the 

1123
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:04,330
average straight brain works reacts to 
certain things.

1124
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:09,331
This is kind of dicey situation and 
territory because we don't know all the 

1125
00:49:09,331 --> 00:49:10,780
facts,
but according to all the other research,

1126
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,900
why is the gay penis a half inch longer?
Apparently it may have to do with the 

1127
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,590
Androgens,
the presence of more androgens I guess,

1128
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:25,591
or a type more testosterone,
whatever it is in the uterus at a 

1129
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:29,011
certain point in time,
which may be why some people are born 

1130
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:34,620
gay and other people because it is 
something you're born with and some 

1131
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,130
people are born straight and we're 
drawing.

1132
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:41,130
I'm being very binary.
Do you think though that it is possible 

1133
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,960
to be born straight,
but somewhere along your,

1134
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:48,000
along the lines of your life become 
attracted to this,

1135
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,230
to the same sex and be gay?
I don't know.

1136
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,110
Maybe I have no idea.
Just trying to pretend he doesn't.

1137
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:54,210
No,
no.

1138
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:59,220
I've been trying to say I don't know a 
lot more ever since trump won because I 

1139
00:49:59,220 --> 00:49:59,350
was very.
I was like,

1140
00:49:59,351 --> 00:50:01,600
let me tell you another reason.
He's not going to win guys,

1141
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,210
because some people think that you can 
learn gay behavior,

1142
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:09,211
which is why it was so.
Some people are really terrified of of 

1143
00:50:09,211 --> 00:50:10,000
gay people.
I think they're going to get turned gay.

1144
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,880
Those people are like,
they might be.

1145
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,940
They might be.
I can be around guys fucking all the 

1146
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:17,940
time.
You yes you,

1147
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,540
but you're not an easily influenced guy 
in that regard.

1148
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,720
Like there was some fucking people out 
there that you just know you could talk 

1149
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,800
into sucking your Dick if you were gay.
You just know that it might not be gay.

1150
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,070
Like shop for example.

1151
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,970
Oh sorry.
So how dare.

1152
00:50:29,971 --> 00:50:31,200
Sorry,
he's not here to defend it.

1153
00:50:31,201 --> 00:50:36,201
I feel like there's,
there's a certain percentage of the 

1154
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:37,730
population that could be shifted around.
They could.

1155
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,760
They'll dell adopt an English accent if 
they live in England for a week.

1156
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,190
You're sure.
Like there's a certain percentage.

1157
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:44,690
Peer pressure.
Yeah,

1158
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:48,080
they'll suck a dick for peer to turn gay
to have better friends.

1159
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:52,910
So let me ask you this.
I believe that you can't say that better

1160
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:55,160
friends.
I really believe that's true and I don't

1161
00:50:55,161 --> 00:51:00,161
think there's anything wrong with it 
necessarily because why is that any 

1162
00:51:00,161 --> 00:51:02,861
better than being or worse rather than 
being indoctrinated into a certain 

1163
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:06,500
school of music.
Like will you all listening to tribe,

1164
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,050
right?
Yeah.

1165
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:12,100
Why is it any different than a religion 
or anything else that people get super 

1166
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,920
sucked into and they altered their 
behavior?

1167
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:18,100
I had one guy,
I had one gay feeling like feeling a 

1168
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,900
feeling if I'm really honest with 
myself,

1169
00:51:19,901 --> 00:51:22,130
like flashdance what a feeling,
how it was when I.

1170
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,890
When I believed in my heart that me and 
Tom Cruise were friends.

1171
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,220
When I got to talk to him for about an 
hour and a half and we're having a deep 

1172
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,701
discussion and of course met him before 
that because I did a reading with him 

1173
00:51:33,701 --> 00:51:36,260
and we were having this great talk and I
was even like teasing them going,

1174
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,690
what's it like to be the king?
I did just.

1175
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,160
Do you have certain shows?
No,

1176
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,530
no.
It was a good conversation with her,

1177
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,880
but I remember thinking to myself,
if this guy's gay,

1178
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:48,881
he's very cute.
He's got a little face and I thought to 

1179
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:51,401
myself,
this guy's gay and he really wanted to 

1180
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:51,401
be my friend and I can hang out with him
and I was drunk enough.

1181
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:53,150
Do you think you can take your whole hog
and it's my self.

1182
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,320
It's got a little face.
Hey,

1183
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,840
don't talk about my Dick here.

1184
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,010
I'm talking about my mouth,
Bro.

1185
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,570
I don't need you to talk about the Dick 
Sucking.

1186
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:00,830
I didn't say that.
His face.

1187
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:03,530
If it's a small face,
you're going to pick a guy to fuck.

1188
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,420
You definitely want one that can blow 
you.

1189
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,380
Yes.
I need a small.

1190
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,760
Got It.
I need a small head about,

1191
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:12,761
not heads,
but if it's a big head than you can get 

1192
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:12,761
your whole Dick and his mother.
No,

1193
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:12,761
no.
I like.

1194
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:16,450
I like really shoehorn that bad boy.
Now you're gonna.

1195
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,100
Have to snake.
Just got to unhinge your jaw here.

1196
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,070
It's not going to be comfortable around 
ratchet and hard surfaces.

1197
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:23,900
Man.
You want more soft surfaces?

1198
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:29,060
Shoe it in there.
I'll get some butterflies or sticking 

1199
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,060
stuff into their lips.
And what are they doing?

1200
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,510
They're accentuating soft surface area.
Yeah.

1201
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,300
We're trying to get you more excited 
about them.

1202
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:33,200
Put Your Dick in her mouth.

1203
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,310
I'm also a fan of that and that's what 
I'd make Tom too.

1204
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:37,160
If we were dating.
I met fast by the way.

1205
00:52:37,161 --> 00:52:39,350
Women are,
they're shooting their lips up again.

1206
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,960
It's getting more prevalent.
See it all the time.

1207
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:43,100
I don't get it.
I don't like it.

1208
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,260
It's crazy.
Yeah,

1209
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,710
I'll get.
Apparently now they can do it where it's

1210
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:47,180
not so hard,
you know?

1211
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,210
Or before they were doing it and then 
the lips would be hard and that kind of 

1212
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,840
freaked people out.
I have a problem with the hard lips,

1213
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,360
five years I've kissed hard lips before 
if kiss fake lips.

1214
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:01,570
I don't like what's just a bizarre 
compromise because the one of the 

1215
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:05,621
sexiest things about kissing is like the
feeling of someone's lips moving with 

1216
00:53:05,621 --> 00:53:08,510
your lips and their tongue moving with 
your tongue and then all of a sudden you

1217
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:13,511
have this like third partner there is 
implant and you feel it and you're 

1218
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:18,101
rubbing it around and each other's 
mouths and it's like what is in your 

1219
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:21,611
lip?
But you know what lip and then there's 

1220
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:22,940
like you got an Oreo lip cream filling 
in this lip.

1221
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:25,980
There's some shit going on in there.
But they've said that some people

1222
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,500
are driven by.
So if you and I look at a woman,

1223
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,000
right?
We look at her lips big,

1224
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:31,500
so I love big lips,
red lips,

1225
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,420
soft lips.
You look at her breasts,

1226
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:36,330
she looked and I think to myself what 
that would feel like,

1227
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:37,450
right?
The what?

1228
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:42,710
I guess what triggers me is the idea of 
what those lips would feel like to kiss 

1229
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:46,491
or grab and becomes this primal thing,
but they say some people are more drawn 

1230
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:51,380
driven by like the visual stimulus.
So some guys prefer fake tits.

1231
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:53,760
In fact,
they even liked them to look fake.

1232
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,940
They like big lips.
Some guys will tell their girls to get 

1233
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,070
big lips.
They'll tell their girls to get,

1234
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,050
you know,
big fake tits because they'd rather that

1235
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:06,051
even though they're hard,
they're willing to compromise the feel 

1236
00:54:06,051 --> 00:54:09,830
for the visual and,
and so depending on what you're driven 

1237
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,590
by that is.

1238
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,930
There's a book written about this,
and I can't remember the book,

1239
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,520
but I'm in a very small portion of 
people are driven by auditory stimulus.

1240
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,430
So your voice might be enough to get a 
girl going.

1241
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,760
You could look like,
you know,

1242
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:23,970
whatever.
Something's not attractive,

1243
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:28,971
but your voice is what gets her going.
So it all depends on what triggers 

1244
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:30,840
people,
what they're overwhelming,

1245
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,740
sort of what the connection is to their 
senses.

1246
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,020
You know,
the probably the biggest one,

1247
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:42,350
the biggest difference from men and 
women is the desire for successful 

1248
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:45,000
companion and men don't give a fuck if a
woman's successful.

1249
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,710
No,
they don't at all.

1250
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:48,600
I was going to ask you that.
What do you think it is?

1251
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,240
Because it's not just about beauty.
Going back to that robot thing,

1252
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,290
you know,
I've dated,

1253
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:54,180
we've always had beautiful women in my 
life.

1254
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:54,470
You know,
I've,

1255
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,610
I've,
but there's always one you,

1256
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,730
you fall on who you're compatible with.
A lot of women,

1257
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:00,060
you know,
I've,

1258
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:01,560
I've loved many women in my life,
but there's,

1259
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,490
there's something about some women that 
gets you to shack up with them.

1260
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,070
Well,
the same thing with friends too.

1261
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,550
It's like what?
Why do you,

1262
00:55:08,551 --> 00:55:10,800
why did you and I become instant best 
friends,

1263
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:11,730
right?
Like right away,

1264
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,590
like I met you when we're on a set of 
mad TV and like

1265
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:15,800
then,
like 20 minutes,

1266
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,920
like make me stick together,
stick together.

1267
00:55:18,921 --> 00:55:20,090
Yeah.
We're going to be okay.

1268
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,240
[inaudible] finally,
I found what I mean,

1269
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,340
we've been best friends from that moment
on,

1270
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:28,130
like literally we were close 
immediately,

1271
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,990
but there's other people that you meet 
and you're like,

1272
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:32,930
fuck right and get outta here and they 
might be fine.

1273
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,700
And then someone might say,
oh my God,

1274
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:36,200
have you met Mike?
He's amazing.

1275
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,220
And you're like,
yeah,

1276
00:55:37,221 --> 00:55:38,350
Mike's a good guy.
Yeah,

1277
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,290
I'm bored,
but yeah,

1278
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:40,290
you're bored.
Bored.

1279
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,330
I don't want to do it.
What is that?

1280
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:46,340
Was that,
is that just personalities who don't 

1281
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:46,370
resonate with drive?
Some people fucking crazy.

1282
00:55:46,371 --> 00:55:47,720
Your wife loves it,
you know,

1283
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:50,840
it's like who you are versus who they 
are.

1284
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,540
Like sometimes it goes like this shoot 
and the,

1285
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:58,541
the,
the fingers of the hand fit into the 

1286
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:00,461
fingers,
the other hand and everything's great 

1287
00:56:00,461 --> 00:56:00,660
chemical and other times it's just,
they're clashing teeth and you know,

1288
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,330
you ever kissed somebody in clash teeth.

1289
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:04,070
You know what in the fuck are we doing 
here?

1290
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:09,090
Nope.
Neither one of us know what the hell 

1291
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:09,090
we're doing.
Clinic.

1292
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:10,560
It's just perfect.
Yes.

1293
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,250
Some people,
the sex is like that too.

1294
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:15,320
It's like it's rhythmic.
It moves,

1295
00:56:15,321 --> 00:56:20,321
it flows and other people.
It's just clunky and it's the same 

1296
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:24,131
person.
You're the same person and for whatever 

1297
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:24,930
reason it might not them.
It might be you.

1298
00:56:24,931 --> 00:56:27,590
It might be the two of you together.
You just fucking and that.

1299
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:32,591
I think that that's part of the 
mechanism that makes this weird world 

1300
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:33,490
work.
Human beings,

1301
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:37,810
the way I view them are a gigantic super
organism working towards some sort of an

1302
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:42,811
unknown technological goal.
I felt like if I had to do a one 

1303
00:56:42,811 --> 00:56:44,890
sentence overview of the human race,
that's what I would say and I think that

1304
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:50,070
somewhere along the line,
our individual personalities and our 

1305
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,820
individual hobbies and obsessions and 
desires,

1306
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:57,210
all of those,
although they appear to be coming from 

1307
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,180
us uniquely and us as an individual and 
even though we relate to tribes who are 

1308
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:00,520
also into,
you know,

1309
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:05,110
whatever Jujitsu or kettle bells or 
ballet or whatever the fuck it is.

1310
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,530
Ultimately all these pieces fit into 
place as these portions of this super 

1311
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,400
organism that make things flow in a 
forward direction and whether you're 

1312
00:57:17,411 --> 00:57:22,411
obsessed with architecture or whether 
you're obsessed with achieving peak 

1313
00:57:22,411 --> 00:57:24,430
fitness or running a thousand miles in 
an hour,

1314
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:30,150
whatever the fuck it is,
all of those things are working together

1315
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:35,610
collectively in the entire super 
organism of the human race and they're 

1316
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:40,411
working towards some sort of a 
technological goal because that's the 

1317
00:57:40,411 --> 00:57:41,680
technological world and the world of 
technological innovation.

1318
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,760
It's slowly but surely integrating 
itself into our lives.

1319
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,740
If we looked at it objectively,
we'd be like,

1320
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:52,741
Whoa,
this is like a life form that's asking 

1321
00:57:52,741 --> 00:57:55,411
to be born from the husks of human 
civilization like it's gonna go inside 

1322
00:57:55,481 --> 00:58:00,481
of us and it's going to give birth like 
some sort of aquatic worm that comes out

1323
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:03,310
of a fucking grasshopper talks into 
jumping into a pond.

1324
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,640
I think it's interesting that human 
beings are spending enough time creating

1325
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:12,641
virtual experiences so that eventually,
if you look at the trajectory of this 

1326
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:17,471
and the technology under a play,
you're going to be able to have 

1327
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,090
experiences of what it's like to be 
someone else.

1328
00:58:20,091 --> 00:58:20,930
Yeah,
for sure.

1329
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:23,240
So if you can download it into their 
brain or whatever,

1330
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:28,241
we're already there already.
There's this thing called the empathy 

1331
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:30,971
project.
I think the same where you go to a room 

1332
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:32,450
and they bring the Syrian refugee crisis
to you.

1333
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:37,530
They put you put on a virtual,
these virtual goggles and you're inside 

1334
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:40,040
the tent of a rush refugee family in a 
refugee camp.

1335
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:44,960
Kids are playing the mom and dad or 
they're cooking food and you can see it.

1336
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,670
You can hear it,
you can feel it,

1337
00:58:46,671 --> 00:58:51,671
and they're all around you.
It's three dimensional and it gives you 

1338
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:53,090
a sense of what programs is for programs
to museum.

1339
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:54,410
It's a museum.
There you go.

1340
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,300
God,
I love the collection of virtual reality

1341
00:58:56,301 --> 00:58:58,880
experiences to help us see the world 
through the eyes of another.

1342
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:01,910
This is a beautiful idea.
What an amazing idea.

1343
00:59:01,911 --> 00:59:03,540
Yeah,
so what happened on the back that up,

1344
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:05,960
back up so I could read it because 
there's so back it up.

1345
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,730
Yeah,
but you could back up the video.

1346
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,200
No,
you can't rewind it.

1347
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:10,070
Oh,
it's.

1348
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,510
Oh,
it's the video on their website.

1349
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,210
Oh,
okay.

1350
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,280
And it isn't that amazing.
So now you can experience what it's like

1351
00:59:16,281 --> 00:59:21,281
to be someone else who's been through a 
hard time and realize in many ways that 

1352
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:26,501
they're very human.
Why have all these emotional triggers 

1353
00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:28,721
around Arabs and stuff?
Because I grew up in the Arab world and 

1354
00:59:28,721 --> 00:59:28,721
they are.
They're very much people to me,

1355
00:59:28,721 --> 00:59:29,630
right?
The Middle East,

1356
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:34,930
that this system,
this strange place with all those 

1357
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:34,940
fanatics that when you grow up there the
way I did,

1358
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:36,350
you lived there for eight years of your 
life.

1359
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,050
You have a very different point of view 
on the Middle East and the Arabs.

1360
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:44,100
What I think of when I think of Arabs is
I see a smiling face and a welcoming 

1361
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:48,520
mat.
I see somebody who is making me tea and 

1362
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,070
bringing me into their house and given 
me food.

1363
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:54,370
I see a group of them who are laughing 
their ass off and having a blast and I 

1364
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:57,950
see people hugging and holding hands.
That's just how I grew up.

1365
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,160
So I have an emotional trigger when I 
hear people stereotype Arabs in a 

1366
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:03,160
certain way.
Right.

1367
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,440
It's just an interesting thing.
So I think that's because I had that 

1368
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,501
virtual experience and I love this idea 
because as we are able to experience 

1369
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:15,200
what it's like to be someone else and 
realize how similar they are to us,

1370
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:20,530
despite all the cultural differences.
Hopefully it'll make for at least a 

1371
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:20,530
more.
I,

1372
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:21,740
you know what the problem is all is,
is.

1373
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:26,950
Yeah.
It'll make for a more understanding 

1374
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:27,410
world until I got to compete for fucking
water and my daughter's thirsty.

1375
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:32,770
Now I'm going to have to off you will 
see much seems like there's plenty of 

1376
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:36,251
water.
I think the biggest problem that we've 

1377
01:00:36,251 --> 01:00:38,621
got right now is that we've been going 
through a war with the Middle East for 

1378
01:00:38,621 --> 01:00:41,990
13 years and when you go through a war 
for 13 years,

1379
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:43,250
what is the Ta,
you know,

1380
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:47,660
like say if you do something like if 
you're on heroin for six years,

1381
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:52,870
how long does it take for that to the 
effects of your body to bounce back from

1382
01:00:52,911 --> 01:00:55,130
being on heroin for six years because 
it's not going to be a week,

1383
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,260
right?
Is it going to be a year?

1384
01:00:57,261 --> 01:01:00,080
A couple of years is going to be half 
the time I was going to be three years.

1385
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:01,640
Whatever it is.

1386
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:06,940
You've got to think of a war as being 
something like some sort of horrible 

1387
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,890
trauma to an organism takes.
Generally it takes a generation.

1388
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:14,891
At least it's like a scar that has to 
heal over and it has to be worked on.

1389
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,150
I mean you have many generations,
so they're gonna.

1390
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:23,170
Remember grandpa getting blown up when 
he was in a wedding party because they 

1391
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:27,341
thought that he was with talking to the 
Jews about the genesis on the mall and 

1392
01:01:27,341 --> 01:01:29,740
costs to the Armenians about the 
genocide and you know,

1393
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,030
in 1914 or 18 whenever it was.
Yeah,

1394
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:35,480
they're still out in the street of 
course.

1395
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,420
Right.
What's the.

1396
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:41,930
Dan Carlin talks about how there's such 
fresh memories,

1397
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:46,931
even if you say to a Chinese person that
you have a point of view on sort of the 

1398
01:01:46,931 --> 01:01:51,041
benefits of Mongol expansion.
Even though that was how many years it 

1399
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:51,190
was.

1400
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,610
12 slash 60 or whatever it was.
You'll get a lot of Chinese either.

1401
01:01:55,730 --> 01:02:00,730
You'll get a lot of people.
It's still somehow fresh trauma lasts 

1402
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,140
and is passed down through generation to
generation.

1403
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,940
You know what I mean?
If you've ever been to Japan,

1404
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
one of the things that people always 
talk about is how the older Japanese 

1405
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,380
people do not like Americans and why 
fucking day.

1406
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:17,680
You know,
we dropped two nuclear bombs on their 

1407
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:17,680
little tiny ass country.
Yeah.

1408
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,360
Yeah.
I think that it's super hard to erase 

1409
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,780
the memory of horrific events and the 13
years of war,

1410
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,870
no matter whose side you're on,
that is a horrific event.

1411
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:32,190
It's all in this one area,
so that's that.

1412
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:37,280
I mean,
that's kind of take a long time before 

1413
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,720
we can look at Arabs,
the way you look at Arabs being there.

1414
01:02:39,721 --> 01:02:41,670
Of course,
and that's unfortunate man.

1415
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:46,780
It's unfortunate because it's one of 
those self perpetuating things like if 

1416
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,380
you're afraid of people,
if you think people are out to get you,

1417
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:51,150
then they become out to get you.
You know,

1418
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:51,720
like they,
they,

1419
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:55,470
you realize that you're taking these big
giant steps to keep them away from you.

1420
01:02:55,510 --> 01:03:00,510
You're prejudice against them and 
they're going to be upset that you're 

1421
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:00,510
prejudiced against them.
And then.

1422
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,580
But I love Americans because Americans 
always go out of their way.

1423
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,620
Like all Americans go out of their way 
to be like,

1424
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:09,740
I don't care.
There's this idea that all the trump 

1425
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:09,860
supporters are these fanatics and they,
they're anti this net.

1426
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:15,470
I guarantee.
I guarantee that the majority of people 

1427
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:18,771
in all the states that red states would 
give any Syrian or Arabic guys,

1428
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:21,630
Americans,
and I guarantee the creative would be,

1429
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,550
hey,
they're human beings.

1430
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,250
I'm willing to give them a chance if 
they're good people,

1431
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,030
they're good people.

1432
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:32,290
This idea that they're terrorists eat 
mother bugs and now I'm just niggling 

1433
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:32,290
guy with a gun.
I don't buy that.

1434
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,320
I don't buy that.
I think definitely a lot of people,

1435
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,900
there are a lot of people like that,
but on an individual basis,

1436
01:03:36,901 --> 01:03:41,070
I guarantee most people are intelligent 
enough to go.

1437
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,340
I'll take him as it comes.
I treat individuals the way they are.

1438
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:45,880
I,
I,

1439
01:03:45,881 --> 01:03:47,830
I think we are tribal.
I think we're.

1440
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,730
Everybody has their own racial 
prejudices and things like that,

1441
01:03:50,731 --> 01:03:54,090
but I think it's way more layered and 
nuanced and a lot of people,

1442
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:59,091
but for a lot of people,
people really fucking simple and their 

1443
01:03:59,091 --> 01:03:59,091
ideology says that,
you know,

1444
01:03:59,091 --> 01:04:03,390
Christianity is the only way and this 
ideology of the Muslims is dangerous.

1445
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:05,820
The Prophet Mohammed was a dangerous 
person.

1446
01:04:05,821 --> 01:04:07,920
These are dangerous people and we let 
them over here.

1447
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:11,280
We're taking a big chance America land 
of the free home of the brave for you.

1448
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,570
That may be the collective dialog.
I don't think that's the individual.

1449
01:04:15,571 --> 01:04:16,890
For example,
I think most of them,

1450
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:21,891
if somebody was Arabic and they had an 
opportunity to leave their alleviate 

1451
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,430
their suffering by bringing them into 
their house and giving them a meal.

1452
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,130
I think you watched so many Bruce Willis
movie,

1453
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:26,640
I think.
I think the.

1454
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,860
The most of them would do it.
I really do.

1455
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:29,910
Well,
I think most of them,

1456
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:34,911
if they knew the people for sure.
I think overcoming prejudices against 

1457
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:39,261
cultures or religions or anything or 
very difficult to do because once those 

1458
01:04:39,261 --> 01:04:42,060
things are set in stone,
it's like your body as a warning pattern

1459
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:45,300
that it's looking for like up these 
patterns repeating itself.

1460
01:04:45,301 --> 01:04:47,460
We've seen this before.
This is religious fundamentalism.

1461
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:52,730
This is a people that are crazy.
They're going to blow themselves up and 

1462
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:55,320
to an extent you know that's not,
that's not misplaced.

1463
01:04:55,321 --> 01:05:00,321
So when I hear of a bomb going off or a 
guy driving a truck and running over 80,

1464
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,360
80 people in France,
my first,

1465
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,700
my first guess,
and I'm always right,

1466
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:10,730
is that he's probably a young Muslim 
male that doesn't make me anti Muslim.

1467
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:15,860
It doesn't make me anti Arab,
it just means I'm pretty good or not 

1468
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,650
even.
I don't have to be that good at pattern.

1469
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,210
Yeah.
Well we

1470
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,790
also have to really take into 
consideration the sheer numbers of human

1471
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:26,791
beings that we're dealing with on a 
daily basis where you're getting the 

1472
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:28,300
news from getting the news from the 
events that happened to 7 billion people

1473
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,400
and that's just way too many for us to 
make rational discussions about it.

1474
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:37,540
Because rationally you should know about
what the fuck is happening in France.

1475
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,440
You shouldn't know that some Muslim guy 
drove a truck over all these people.

1476
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,180
You're not there.
Right?

1477
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:48,360
And there's some,
you know how many other Muslim men 

1478
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,240
didn't run over somebody with a truck 
that day.

1479
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,310
So that's where it gets weird.
Yeah,

1480
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:56,340
because you don't even take those people
into consideration when you're talking 

1481
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:59,071
about Muslim males.
You're only talking about those one 

1482
01:05:59,071 --> 01:05:59,071
males.
It's like gun owners,

1483
01:05:59,071 --> 01:06:03,270
like people have this idea of gun owners
and gun owners are a bunch of fucking 

1484
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:03,510
paranoid nuts with canned food in their 
basement.

1485
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:05,810
They're buying gold from Alex Jones.
No,

1486
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:06,700
no,
no.

1487
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:11,380
The occasionally one of those guys 
shoots up a school occasionally,

1488
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:16,770
but you know how many people own guns?
There's more guns in this country than 

1489
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:16,770
there are fucking people.
Yeah,

1490
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:20,080
so we've really had like this crazy gun 
problem.

1491
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:22,750
Things would be going off way more than 
they do.

1492
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,970
It's remarkably safe considering the 
amount of fucking firearms are available

1493
01:06:26,971 --> 01:06:28,580
to markably.
Incredibly.

1494
01:06:28,581 --> 01:06:30,880
Yeah.
Like almost every day of your life.

1495
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:33,550
You go through town and you don't hear a
single gunshot,

1496
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:36,170
but that's also going back to what I was
saying about you,

1497
01:06:36,171 --> 01:06:37,810
you know when,
when somebody owns a gun,

1498
01:06:37,811 --> 01:06:38,890
they're like,
rose McGowan says,

1499
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:41,380
somebody says smile,
and she immediately says,

1500
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,880
I'm not.
I'm putting words in your mouth,

1501
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:44,590
but this is essentially what we said in 
the interview,

1502
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:50,070
that that guy is being in one way or 
another sexist or being in one way or 

1503
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:51,940
another somewhat oppressive and 
suppressive.

1504
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,970
I'm sure she feels that what I'm saying 
is that for,

1505
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,150
for that guy,
he may just be clumsily trying to say hi

1506
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:03,151
to some of the most beautiful creature 
he's ever seen in his life because at 

1507
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:03,260
the same way with gun owners,
gun owners,

1508
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,180
a lot of time,
hold on,

1509
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:05,950
let me stop you there because couldn't 
it be both things?

1510
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,890
It could be both.
Sent it to him.

1511
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,060
It could be this one thing to her like,
look,

1512
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:15,061
if you really,
really into raping girls and it makes 

1513
01:07:15,061 --> 01:07:15,580
you feel awesome and you don't want them
to feel like it's rape,

1514
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:18,280
but it is 100 percent that they're 
always there.

1515
01:07:18,281 --> 01:07:23,281
They're equating those two,
but I'm just saying that there could be 

1516
01:07:23,281 --> 01:07:24,070
two different things going on.
His intention and the actual results.

1517
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:29,370
One hundred percent.
I'm just saying when you draw these 

1518
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:29,370
blanket statements like so when men 
owned guns,

1519
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:29,370
right?

1520
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:31,660
If you hear the dialogue on the left,
a lot of times it's like,

1521
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:32,500
well,
you know,

1522
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:37,501
these gun nuts.
Are these gun owners who are into all 

1523
01:07:37,501 --> 01:07:37,501
this other stuff,
this macho stuff,

1524
01:07:37,501 --> 01:07:41,070
or are a lot of men owned guns?
A lot of men's can sound crazy.

1525
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:46,200
Lot of men on guns like me because it's 
the most effective way to protect my 

1526
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,330
family in case somebody comes in my 
house in the middle of the night.

1527
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:52,060
That's actually something I think about 
a something.

1528
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:57,061
I'm ready for it.
Something I prepare for the past 20 

1529
01:07:57,061 --> 01:07:57,061
years.
A lot of men do that.

1530
01:07:57,061 --> 01:07:58,650
I'm crazy.
I'm just saying at the end of the day,

1531
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:00,730
Brian only practices,
escape routes.

1532
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:04,120
Got Paths for ambushes,
pinch points in his house.

1533
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:07,540
I like pinch,
pinch,

1534
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:11,320
pinch point is when you know people have
to travel through a corridor.

1535
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:12,310
That's great.
Yeah.

1536
01:08:12,311 --> 01:08:15,100
So for like 300 words,
know.

1537
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:15,980
Let me move it to

1538
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,540
300.
The Persian side to come to you.

1539
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:19,190
Yeah,
exactly.

1540
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,970
That's a pinch and I need some hot gates
point set up a tree stand.

1541
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:25,400
If you're hunting deer,
go to the pinch point.

1542
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:27,170
If they have to make their way out into 
the field,

1543
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:30,110
I feel best go through the woods.
I feel my house,

1544
01:08:30,111 --> 01:08:33,350
my next house is going to be just a 
fucking series of pinch points.

1545
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,180
Oh,
where are you going to move to?

1546
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:36,870
Somewhere where there a lot of pinch 
points.

1547
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,360
Are you going to stay in California 
forever?

1548
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,010
Probably.
Probably.

1549
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,410
I know.
Let me say it.

1550
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,480
Let me put it this way.
I want to.

1551
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:46,970
I want to just stand up forever.
Forever.

1552
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:48,830
I'm never gonna stop going.
Wow.

1553
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,630
I remember when you weren't doing it at 
all.

1554
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,180
Well,
I do it all the time and I never stopped

1555
01:08:53,181 --> 01:08:55,040
doing it.
My favorite did stop once.

1556
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,810
I don't remember.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1557
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,830
That's the only time that was a 
different guy.

1558
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:06,250
As a guy who dated my sister,
I was the guy who might be bugged with 

1559
01:09:06,611 --> 01:09:07,970
her boyfriend broke up with bro.

1560
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,490
We don't.
We do that though.

1561
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:18,670
There's something about standups when 
you find out that somebody quits stand 

1562
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:18,670
up,
you're like,

1563
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:19,250
oh,
what happened?

1564
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:20,870
Right.
What kind of life do you have?

1565
01:09:20,871 --> 01:09:23,240
No,
I just thought of that.

1566
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,860
Fuck.
That's funny you say that.

1567
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:30,070
What kind of life do you have now?
Just thought of somebody that I was 

1568
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:32,591
like,
what happened to that guy who was doing 

1569
01:09:32,591 --> 01:09:32,591
a lot of stand up and you stopped.
I know man,

1570
01:09:32,591 --> 01:09:33,130
like you and I had a great fucking time.
Listen,

1571
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,090
I had to come up.
Go down there.

1572
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,330
It's sold out.
Killer show was so much fun.

1573
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,180
What a blast.
That powerful Sam Tripoli specific,

1574
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:42,680
by the way,
a monster.

1575
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:43,730
Nobody knows her load.
He is.

1576
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:45,500
How good is he?
He's gonna kill you.

1577
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,680
He'll kill.
I brought him with me on the road once 

1578
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,661
in Edmonton at that place on fire 
because he was getting ready for his cd 

1579
01:09:52,661 --> 01:09:53,270
that he taped in Edmonton.

1580
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,250
He hit you taped a CD at that club 
there.

1581
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,560
What's the club in Edmonton?
He's called me a comic strip.

1582
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,390
Yeah,
that's blank Bronson Club.

1583
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:00,770
We did,
um,

1584
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:06,010
the casino up there that they always in 
Edmonton where they always have fights 

1585
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:10,600
and I'm fucking.
What's the name I know they were 

1586
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:10,600
creating awesome place.
And two,

1587
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,500
he lit it on fire.
Lit that place on fire.

1588
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:14,480
Beast.
I call him the monster.

1589
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:17,270
He can.
He can destroy tie on last night.

1590
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,030
Yes she did.
I went to Afghanistan with that guy,

1591
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,380
got his done.
Whoa.

1592
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,440
Me,
him and Doug Davidoff and Steve Byrne 

1593
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:26,440
and he gay stuff happened.
Uh,

1594
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,320
I'm not going to go into that.
Uh,

1595
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,450
may have met some soldiers.
I was there.

1596
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:32,540
I was there traveling concubine in there
and they showed.

1597
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:34,600
They showed me with a pinch point is,
whoa.

1598
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:39,660
Yeah.
This is a pinch point right here on 

1599
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:39,660
appeal.
This piece right here.

1600
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:42,030
Same Guy,
same guy.

1601
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:45,560
Took me a school onto Haitian.
Um,

1602
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:47,180
yeah,
it was pretty interesting.

1603
01:10:47,181 --> 01:10:52,181
But uh,
but Sam would get up and he would open 

1604
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:54,161
for us.
We'd go out there and just get a mic in 

1605
01:10:54,161 --> 01:10:56,081
a little box and it's like,
that's an awkward with all these 

1606
01:10:56,081 --> 01:10:56,990
soldiers sitting around in a war zone.
That dude lit it up every fucking time.

1607
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:01,070
But one of the things about Sam is he,
like a lot of comics are comics has done

1608
01:11:01,071 --> 01:11:06,071
that room when there was zero crowd 
control and he would get a lot of late 

1609
01:11:06,071 --> 01:11:09,701
spots.
So you learned that combat comedy style 

1610
01:11:09,701 --> 01:11:10,760
combat company.
He's like probably be more confident and

1611
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:13,680
comfortable when shit goes crazy when 
people start at him like,

1612
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:14,160
Oh,
I've been

1613
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,480
here before.
Here we go.

1614
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:17,280
I know you ain't been here,
but I've been here.

1615
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,480
Yeah,
let's roll buddy.

1616
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:20,220
Yes.
My favorite was Savvis.

1617
01:11:20,221 --> 01:11:22,120
He's always changing his face.
His look,

1618
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,640
he's got a goatee,
got a mustache,

1619
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:25,560
got a full beard,
got no peer,

1620
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:28,140
and I'm like shaved up because switched 
up.

1621
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:30,720
Sometimes you gotta switch it up,
like to switch it up sometimes.

1622
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,840
Then he grabs my body and he goes,
how the fuck do you do it?

1623
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:36,120
How do you do it?
You got the best body in comedy.

1624
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:36,880
I go,
Joe Rogan,

1625
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,610
best body of comedy and then I walk 
away.

1626
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,190
I love him.
He loves you.

1627
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:43,320
I got to get him on the podcast is a 
good dude.

1628
01:11:43,321 --> 01:11:44,300
The fighter and the kid.
Not,

1629
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,010
not,
not the Brian Counseling.

1630
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,320
We call it mixed mental arts now.
That's what you call them and I think 

1631
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:51,320
it's better mixed metal arts because 
hunter was like,

1632
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:54,330
yeah,
because hunt mixed mental arts is better

1633
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:56,730
and we've been having these great 
conversations and hunter was like,

1634
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,710
let's stop being so myopic.

1635
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:01,080
Let's just get all the ideas under one 
umbrella.

1636
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:04,380
Let's make ideas accessible to get to 
pull the ambitious project,

1637
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:06,330
but he's like,
I want to make sure everybody knows that

1638
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:11,331
there's no such thing as being smart.
We can all know these ideas and have a 

1639
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:11,331
constructive conversation.
Well,

1640
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:14,940
he's got a great attitude about it and 
that really is the approach to that.

1641
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,370
It's not about smart.
It's about information.

1642
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:22,580
Like I've had conversations with people 
about something and I'll explain 

1643
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:22,580
something to them and they go,
God,

1644
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,040
I feel so stupid.
Like you're not stupid.

1645
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:28,310
Like I'm not smart.
I just know this and the reason why I 

1646
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,280
know this is because somebody figured it
out and I bothered reading it.

1647
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:30,510
That's it.
That's it.

1648
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:35,720
But we like hold that over people's 
heads with like such extreme arrogance 

1649
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:39,560
because so many people want to cling to 
almost anything as like a sign of 

1650
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:39,560
superiority.

1651
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,110
Whether it's information that they have,
accomplishments that they've done,

1652
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,040
the money that they have in the bank,
whatever the fuck it is.

1653
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:48,770
Like they always constantly want to have
this thing that separates them from you.

1654
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:49,450
Right.
You know,

1655
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:52,050
and that's one thing that people love to
do with inflammation will,

1656
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,080
if you had known if you read this then 
you would know that Kaba you cut the 

1657
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,490
shit and just tell me that,
tell me and I'll have a car.

1658
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:04,700
But it was also this thing that we all 
do and that you and I've worked very 

1659
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,240
hard to stop doing over the last decade 
or so,

1660
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:09,280
which is to try to win conversations.
Yes.

1661
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:14,300
Because it's a,
it's a fucking horrible impediment to 

1662
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:17,660
learning anything like that.
The best way to have a conversation is 

1663
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,220
mean challenge ideas for sure.
But just talk.

1664
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,270
Yeah,
just talk.

1665
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,700
Like if someone's telling you something 
and you have a question,

1666
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:25,860
don't look at it like you're attacking 
it.

1667
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,290
Look at it like what is this we're 
discussing?

1668
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:30,030
What is this actual thing like,
you know,

1669
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,890
that weird thing that people do in these
shut.

1670
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:37,130
They shut down and you know that they're
not really discussing what you're 

1671
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:40,641
saying.
They're just trying to find a way where 

1672
01:13:40,641 --> 01:13:40,641
they could win the conversation.
Yeah.

1673
01:13:40,641 --> 01:13:43,950
Because their,
their point of view makes them feel a 

1674
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:43,950
certain way.
Yes.

1675
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,660
And if you start to break down those 
walls,

1676
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:50,690
they're afraid you're going to take away
that feeling of security or whatever 

1677
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:51,300
that feeling is confidence in being 
consistently,

1678
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:52,140
right?
That's right.

1679
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,510
That's a big one.
Yes.

1680
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:55,920
So when someone's not right about 
something,

1681
01:13:55,940 --> 01:14:00,630
like I have a good friend who's a animal
rights activist guide,

1682
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,640
Vegan Guy,
and he was saying we were talking about 

1683
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,420
the precursors for hormone development 
and whether or not saturated fat and 

1684
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,190
cholesterol are

1685
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,680
the essential precursors to hormone 
development.

1686
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:19,710
Well,
it's pretty much established fact 

1687
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:19,710
scientific fact.
So in the.

1688
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:24,330
He didn't think it was because he was 
reading a lot of this ideological dogma 

1689
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:25,840
on it,
you know,

1690
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:28,690
plant based dogma.
So I started sending them all this stuff

1691
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:29,860
and then he's like,
okay,

1692
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,110
I got it all right now as to.
So Ken,

1693
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,600
now we can have a discussion about it.
We'll look at all this,

1694
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:39,601
look at all these studies,
look at all these things like we're not 

1695
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:39,601
saying you should go out and be an 
animal eater,

1696
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:41,050
know what I'm saying that,
but look at the evidence,

1697
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,700
that data,
look at what it actually is,

1698
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,600
right,
and look what is the actual problem with

1699
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:50,610
trying to study.
This is the actual problem with not 

1700
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:52,591
getting enough b12.
This is the actual problem with not 

1701
01:14:52,591 --> 01:14:52,591
getting enough of this vitamin that 
data,

1702
01:14:52,591 --> 01:14:53,860
saturated fat,
cholesterol,

1703
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:57,640
all these fucking things that we were 
told as kids are bad for you,

1704
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:02,850
which is a huge problem because most 
people don't learn anything about 

1705
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:03,430
nutrition past what they learn in 
school.

1706
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,080
I mean that's pretty much it.
Well,

1707
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:10,081
one of the biggest things for me is just
having been around hunter as much as I 

1708
01:15:10,081 --> 01:15:13,471
have and we always talk about how,
and I've had to confront so much of 

1709
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:17,791
this.
My own in my own way is I have a fast 

1710
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:17,791
thinking brain.
We all do,

1711
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:18,580
right?
That fast thinking brand that jumps out,

1712
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:23,610
that triggers that things.
Have you started talking about 

1713
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:25,920
liberalism?
If you start talking about big 

1714
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:25,930
government,
if you start talking about communism,

1715
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:27,040
Marxism,
I get,

1716
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:31,420
I'll get what happens is I'll get ready 
to defend my free market.

1717
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,090
America,
Fox News.

1718
01:15:34,091 --> 01:15:36,100
You have a show on Fox News.
I'm defending my dad.

1719
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:41,160
That's what I'm doing.
I have an emotional attachment to that 

1720
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:45,420
and so I'll stop listening to you about 
bout five seconds in and I've already 

1721
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:50,251
got my guns.
I'm already loaded my guns as you're 

1722
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:50,251
talking.

1723
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:50,251
I'm going.
Hold on.

1724
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:50,251
Let me get my gun so much.
Yeah,

1725
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:51,070
yeah,
I hear you.

1726
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,820
And now I can't wait to blast away at 
your.

1727
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,670
Your collective ideology.
Right?

1728
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:59,790
And then I'll drop books like fix this 
road to serfdom and all the things I've 

1729
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:03,571
read and all they want to do is win.
And so I've had to and we always talk 

1730
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:05,160
about this,
like hunter,

1731
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:07,510
I'll send me articles that'll get me 
enraged,

1732
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:12,530
enraged,
and I'll freak out and I'll write this 

1733
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:12,530
thing and he'll get me.
He'll go,

1734
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:12,530
feel better.
Brian.

1735
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:17,700
Now if you want to tranquilize the big 
fast thinking elephant that you've been 

1736
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,930
riding and let's get some slow thinking 
evolves and take a look at what,

1737
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:22,990
how your feelings are driving there 
thinking it's very.

1738
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:25,600
It's a very fun exercise because as you 
get older,

1739
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:30,720
what happens is you're able to sit back 
and somebody says something and you're 

1740
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,470
able to go,
instead of me loading my guns,

1741
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:35,530
let me listen a little bit hard.
Let me see if I can get.

1742
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:39,130
Take something from that.
Maybe there is a good argument.

1743
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:44,340
Maybe there it may not be at a Marxist,
but maybe there is some value to 

1744
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:49,650
regulation.
Maybe there is some value to the FDA or 

1745
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:50,950
you know,
whatever it might be.

1746
01:16:50,951 --> 01:16:52,280
I've been reading.
So you,

1747
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:57,480
you have free market sort of prejudices 
in that regard where you lean towards 

1748
01:16:57,881 --> 01:17:02,320
deregulation,
lean towards a freer market because more

1749
01:17:02,321 --> 01:17:05,760
money gets made.
Businesses does better.

1750
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:09,980
Lean toward freedom of choice.
So I liked idea but,

1751
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,980
but,
but environmental regulations where I 

1752
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:14,980
draw the line too,
that's like me.

1753
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,390
That's a classic example of the fishing 
game and wildlife.

1754
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:18,530
What is it?
The wildlife,

1755
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,080
the fish and game department of fish and
game.

1756
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:22,340
Excellent job.
Yeah.

1757
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:27,341
I don't care what anybody says.
You and I know and you know even more 

1758
01:17:27,341 --> 01:17:30,460
than the states as well.
They all deserve recognition because 

1759
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,830
they.
They've brought animals back from the 

1760
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:34,631
brink of extinction to gigantic 
populations to get drunk and they shoot 

1761
01:17:34,631 --> 01:17:34,631
the shit out of everything that moves.
That's.

1762
01:17:34,631 --> 01:17:36,620
Well.
There was actually market farming.

1763
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:39,530
Market farming is with didn't most of 
the animals in this country.

1764
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:44,590
After the war,
one of the things that happened was 

1765
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:47,591
there was a lot of soldiers after the 
civil war that needed jobs and one of 

1766
01:17:48,381 --> 01:17:50,900
the jobs that was available was market 
farming.

1767
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:55,980
What does that mean?
That means they didn't have 

1768
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:55,980
refrigerators back then,
buddy.

1769
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,180
So if you wanted meat,
you had to go out and get it.

1770
01:17:56,450 --> 01:18:01,450
And so one of the things they would do 
is they would hire these young men to 

1771
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:04,250
take their rifles and go out and shoot 
every fucking buffalo that moved.

1772
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:07,070
They would shoot buffalo just for their 
tongues.

1773
01:18:07,071 --> 01:18:09,260
They would cut out the tongues of the 
buffaloes.

1774
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,330
They would shoot other ones just for 
their pelts.

1775
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,760
They would shoot.
They shot down everything in sight,

1776
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:17,690
down to antelope.
It was harder to shoot antelope and kill

1777
01:18:17,691 --> 01:18:22,691
them off because they're designed from 
the fucking to have things like cheetahs

1778
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:25,070
chasing a smaller.
They still keep it.

1779
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:30,290
Well,
they're faster than anything that can 

1780
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:33,101
catch them because they evolved during a
time where cheat as lived in North 

1781
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:38,170
America,
big cats lived in North America that 

1782
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:38,170
were bigger than lions and African 
lines.

1783
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:42,460
So when you're thinking about these 
times and these people that wiped out 

1784
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:46,790
all the animals in this country,
there was a host of factors,

1785
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,820
a bunch of different pressures on these 
animals,

1786
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,500
but a lot of it was market hunting.

1787
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:54,620
Yeah,
and so when hunters came along,

1788
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:56,420
like in the beginning of the 20th 
century,

1789
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:01,010
there was very few deer and defined like
a big deer with like a giant rack.

1790
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:06,040
Super rare elk had been.
They'd been extra painted from a 

1791
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:10,280
gigantic segment of the population or 
gigantic sub segment of the country,

1792
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,160
and so they've slowly repopulated in 
these groups.

1793
01:19:13,161 --> 01:19:18,080
Like the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation,
they've transplanted elk down to dearest

1794
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,610
everywhere else.
Yeah.

1795
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:23,480
Sell planning philosophy because they 
corn and a lot of the agricultural crops

1796
01:19:23,481 --> 01:19:28,481
that were planted.
That is true and that's also why white 

1797
01:19:28,481 --> 01:19:29,330
tail deer have done so much better than 
mule deer.

1798
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,360
Mule deer kind of,
you know,

1799
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:36,400
in a much healthier position.
There's still have healthy populations 

1800
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,100
and they still hunt them and you find 
them everywhere.

1801
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:42,490
But mule deer,
they don't live off crops like white 

1802
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:44,270
tail deer is like our friend Doug 
Durham's farm.

1803
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,330
Doug has this awesome place in 
Wisconsin.

1804
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:49,160
Shout out to Doug.
Powerful doctor.

1805
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:53,330
He has essentially they're farm animals,
but they're not.

1806
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:56,230
They're wild.
They're these giant as wild deer,

1807
01:19:56,420 --> 01:20:01,420
but they openly go around his farm or 
farms in the area is different every 

1808
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,380
year,
but some of the best meals I've ever had

1809
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:04,700
by the way.
Incredible.

1810
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:10,060
Like you're.
You're definitely getting like they're 

1811
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,411
eating that fucking monsanto corn.
Did you bring me any elk fucking for 

1812
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:17,220
real or fake game me.
Don't let me leave without a game.

1813
01:20:17,221 --> 01:20:19,320
We'd hunt more and that's the other 
thing.

1814
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:24,410
See you them to get balls deep,
like I'm tired of all the fucking talk 

1815
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:28,131
about this.
And you went hunting with me once and 

1816
01:20:28,131 --> 01:20:29,940
then you motherfuckers,
but you never got crazy with it.

1817
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:32,820
I got crazy with it.
I'm really missing hunting.

1818
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:34,340
I said to my wife yesterday,
go and um,

1819
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:35,580
but I miss the hangout.

1820
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,490
You don't care.
We have a great time.

1821
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:39,930
I started thinking I did something 
wrong.

1822
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,070
Well,
how much fun did we have?

1823
01:20:41,071 --> 01:20:43,080
Did we not?
All twice and had a great time.

1824
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:45,150
Still laughed.
We had a fucking wonderful time.

1825
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,800
Struck out the last time.
Went with Rinella.

1826
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,750
Why don't we go to,
when are we going hunting?

1827
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:51,300
You're hiking with him because he likes 
to suffer and I'll hike with.

1828
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:51,810
No,
no,

1829
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:53,370
no.
You've got to come with us.

1830
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:58,610
We gotta.
We gotta figure out a spot where we 

1831
01:20:58,610 --> 01:20:58,610
could go.
Well,

1832
01:20:58,610 --> 01:20:59,460
we have a reasonable chance of success 
because you always want the option,

1833
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:03,040
the possibility rather than failing.
It really do like a.

1834
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:08,050
You don't want to go hunting.
You don't want to shoot fish in a 

1835
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:08,050
barrel,
you know you want to go.

1836
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:09,960
I like looking in what he does.
It is the best way.

1837
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:12,360
Honestly,
I've hunted a bunch of different ways.

1838
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:16,290
The most satisfying way in the way that 
feels the best to me is public land.

1839
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:18,690
You know,
because you get a tag,

1840
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,670
you know,
you get a over the counter tag,

1841
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,860
you're going public land,
you hunted animal,

1842
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:23,670
you kill,
you eat it.

1843
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:27,150
Everybody sits down over the fire.
And so one of the best moments in life.

1844
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:27,870
Yes.
Yeah.

1845
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:29,690
Rainelle is a master,
you know,

1846
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:33,540
he really has a lot of the aspects of 
life worked out in,

1847
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:36,090
you know,
in like as far as like being a sportsman

1848
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:41,390
in the 21st century and being a 
spokesperson for it because he's so well

1849
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:45,210
read and he's so smart and he's so 
articulate and reasoned.

1850
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:48,510
Like when he makes discussions and 
debates with people about it,

1851
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,870
his,
his approach is so intelligent.

1852
01:21:50,871 --> 01:21:55,871
It's very rare that you find someone in 
that world that's so good at expressing 

1853
01:21:55,871 --> 01:21:56,020
themselves.
Yeah,

1854
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:56,880
he's amazing.

1855
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,790
He's so knowledgeable.
He's always got something to surprise.

1856
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:02,280
You always got something to say,
but we got to go.

1857
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:07,281
We should go.
I want to maybe go elk hunting or 

1858
01:22:07,281 --> 01:22:07,281
something.
I know you bought me a bow.

1859
01:22:07,281 --> 01:22:07,610
Yeah,
yeah.

1860
01:22:07,611 --> 01:22:09,010
Yeah.
And you won't have,

1861
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:11,430
which we're going to set you up with a 
new one,

1862
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:14,660
like the one I gave you.
You got it a year and a half ago.

1863
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:15,640
Care.
What's wrong with that?

1864
01:22:15,641 --> 01:22:20,641
With that?
They have new ones they're getting into 

1865
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:21,570
and I'm thinking the one you gave.
I'm not trading my unused.

1866
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:26,130
Both my brand new.
Well you have graphite dust on it still,

1867
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:29,700
but carbon carbon spider.
It's a really good bow.

1868
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,840
Yeah.
Well believe me.

1869
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:32,630
I'll be saying it's a carbon spider.
Yes.

1870
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:35,450
Is it carbon spider?
It's called the carbon spider.

1871
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,560
Yes.
I was going to say it was made of carbon

1872
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:39,840
spider and they y d,
e R.

1873
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,070
I don't know why they use the word 
spider for like Porsche boxster.

1874
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:45,310
Spyder,
spy,

1875
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:46,170
d,
e R.

1876
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:51,590
I don't know why.
So it's for like certain cars that are 

1877
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,970
convertibles,
but it's also for that bow.

1878
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:58,390
Maybe it's a trademark thing and maybe 
the spider loving,

1879
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,540
but it's a really good bow.
The hoyts of the best.

1880
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,280
There's like,
whoa.

1881
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:05,010
There's like three or four really good 
bowman manufacturers.

1882
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:10,140
It's generally,
there are six year listeners like it 

1883
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:11,110
gets into fucking generally a thought of
that.

1884
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,920
It's white and matthews are the top bows
and the.

1885
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:16,120
That's the only fucking bizarre shit 
elite.

1886
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,790
And then there's Bowtech,
which is also really up there too,

1887
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:21,250
and it's really depends on who you ask.
I'm a white guy.

1888
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:22,600
You got a whole.
Yeah,

1889
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:24,730
I'm awake.
I didn't get any better.

1890
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,050
There's nothing better than a white.
It's matthews.

1891
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:29,680
The question is like,
if you talk to guys like John Dudley,

1892
01:23:29,681 --> 01:23:30,910
he'll,
he'll say that hoists are better.

1893
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:34,390
He said like that in his opinion.
And he knows way more than me.

1894
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,970
He thinks that hoist to the best pose in
the world.

1895
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,430
So I just listened to him and Cameron 
Hanes has the same thing,

1896
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:44,431
so you guys would know.
Nobody knows more about no bow hunting 

1897
01:23:44,431 --> 01:23:45,760
and bowhunting.
Now,

1898
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,790
uh,
you know,

1899
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,970
I'm in a scope from,
from animals,

1900
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:54,360
so I will shoot,
like if I need meat and I'm running low 

1901
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:54,610
on me,
I'll hunt an animal with a rifle.

1902
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,470
Okay.
But what I'm really into,

1903
01:23:56,471 --> 01:23:57,610
man,
is archery.

1904
01:23:57,730 --> 01:24:02,730
I love archery even if I never bow 
hunted again and even if I just hunted 

1905
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:03,130
with a rifle because it was too hard to 
bowhunt,

1906
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,950
which it's not,
and I will bow hunt again for sure,

1907
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:08,620
but archery is,
to me it's a.

1908
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:12,880
it's like a meditation.
It's archery's a martial art in a lot of

1909
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,460
ways,
but it's a stillness martial art.

1910
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:18,400
It's a martial art where you're 
perfecting one move.

1911
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:22,090
This one move of having your arm out in 
front of you.

1912
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:25,690
Your hand is like in a halt position,
like that's where it is,

1913
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:30,810
and then the Bho doesn't pass over the 
lifeline you wanted on this side of the 

1914
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:34,330
lifeline so it never goes deep in your 
grip so you're not torquing your wrist,

1915
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:39,540
so it's basically just balanced up 
against your hand and then you're 

1916
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:43,141
pulling back and you're locking in your 
anchor point and you're looking through 

1917
01:24:43,141 --> 01:24:47,161
your peep site and all you're 
concentrating on is pulling back your 

1918
01:24:47,161 --> 01:24:48,220
scapula and releasing that era without 
moving at all.

1919
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,440
Now what about,
what about emotion do.

1920
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,930
How bent is your straight line?
Straight?

1921
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,860
What about,
but last time,

1922
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:55,810
I do think that ended a little bit.
Last time I did that,

1923
01:24:55,811 --> 01:24:59,110
the [inaudible] your stances.
I hit my fucking hand and I.

1924
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,210
Yeah,
because you're all out hurt so badly.

1925
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:05,140
You're supposed to be like,
this is right,

1926
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:07,810
but I've hit my forearm before it hurts 
a little bit.

1927
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:08,800
Yeah,
but just don't.

1928
01:25:08,801 --> 01:25:10,810
You shouldn't ever hit your forum.
If you're,

1929
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:15,870
if you're shooting correctly,
you'll be in a position where the big 

1930
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:17,860
toe of your foot lines up with the ball 
of your rear foot,

1931
01:25:17,861 --> 01:25:20,770
so your front foot,
big toe and your rear foot ball.

1932
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:23,200
And that gives you a slightly open 
stance.

1933
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:27,040
Very slightly martial arts.
They love this stuff.

1934
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:32,041
I love.
I love technique like that will you to 

1935
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:32,041
learn from Dudley because John Dudley 
from.

1936
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:35,800
He's got a podcast that if you want a 
super geek out about archery,

1937
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:40,660
it's a podcast called knock on and the 
knock on podcast is John's podcast where

1938
01:25:40,661 --> 01:25:45,661
he discusses like intricate details 
about cam timing and Arrow weights and,

1939
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,220
and,
uh,

1940
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:50,310
front of center,
uh,

1941
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:51,940
how much,
uh,

1942
01:25:52,330 --> 01:25:57,330
how much kinetic energy each arrow has 
based on what percentage of weight is in

1943
01:25:58,361 --> 01:26:00,090
the front of the Arrow.
It's like,

1944
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,070
what I love about that is when you 
master something like Dudley in

1945
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,800
a way,
you learn everything in a way.

1946
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:11,801
You're learning so much about life.
Maybe everything that's relevant about 

1947
01:26:11,801 --> 01:26:15,401
life in some ways.
I know you're going to get Orthodox and 

1948
01:26:15,401 --> 01:26:15,401
you're thinking your brain patterns will
be a certain way.

1949
01:26:15,401 --> 01:26:18,980
But like when you start talking that way
and he's thinking about like grade and,

1950
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:23,310
and wait and aerodynamics and like,
yeah,

1951
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,060
great discipline.
What archery really is,

1952
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,400
is a rabbit hole and you know,
you could,

1953
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:31,130
some people go down that rabbit hole and
they go fuck this rabbit hole.

1954
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:36,280
And they get like an old school recurve 
bow and just learn instinctive shooting 

1955
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,540
and they just get into just releasing 
the Arrow on their own and knowing.

1956
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:41,060
It's almost like you throw a rock if you
throw a rock,

1957
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:43,850
you know your arm feels like you kind of
know where that rocks can it go.

1958
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:45,920
And then you get pretty accurate about 
throwing rocks.

1959
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:48,620
But if you want to get really accurate,
you gotta throw rocks every day.

1960
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,570
And that's the same thing with recurve 
bows.

1961
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:55,571
If you have the exact same weight arrow.
So if you have a stack of these arrows 

1962
01:26:55,571 --> 01:26:59,590
and you shoot,
you know that if you bend it this way 

1963
01:26:59,590 --> 01:26:59,870
and you pull it back to here,
it goes that far.

1964
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:00,910
Okay.
I'll say,

1965
01:27:00,911 --> 01:27:05,911
well if the animals here,
then I gotta aim here and you just 

1966
01:27:05,911 --> 01:27:08,420
develop this Eliel in your own mind or 
where the Arrow's going to go.

1967
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:13,510
But it's not that accurate.
It's like if you have an animal with a 

1968
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:17,351
recurve,
like I've watched hunting shows where 

1969
01:27:17,351 --> 01:27:17,351
people hunt animals with recurves 
wounding of animals.

1970
01:27:17,351 --> 01:27:20,720
There's a lot of sketchy shots.
Whereas like if you watch,

1971
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:23,690
like John Dudley puts out some videos of
some of the hunters on,

1972
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:25,520
they're all getting shot through the 
heart.

1973
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:29,030
I'm like 99 percent of the animals,
like they don't even know what happened.

1974
01:27:29,031 --> 01:27:29,270
And then there.

1975
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:34,750
It's interesting though,
like I was thinking about this because 

1976
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:34,750
I've been obsessing over boxing,
you know,

1977
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:38,320
lately.
And I like the reason I like to spar as 

1978
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,111
I don't get.
I'm not knocking my head off and stuff 

1979
01:27:41,111 --> 01:27:41,111
and like Brendan's always like don't 
spar and stuff.

1980
01:27:41,111 --> 01:27:44,330
But for me what I really love is the 
same thing I loved about taekwondo,

1981
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:49,480
which is that with boxing it seems so 
impossible when you first started and 

1982
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,150
then like two years,
two and a half years later,

1983
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:52,400
if you're actually sparring and moving 
around with people,

1984
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:57,730
you'll start developing patterns.
If you have a good teacher and you'll 

1985
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:58,370
start to learn how to get somebody to 
think one thing,

1986
01:27:58,371 --> 01:28:00,350
right?
So you jab and the jab low,

1987
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:03,920
then you fake joe and you and maybe fly 
into a hook or whatever and you learn to

1988
01:28:03,921 --> 01:28:08,921
protect you and you can start developing
your own sort of similar patterns that 

1989
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:09,830
aren't.

1990
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:11,810
It's a different discipline than 
archery.

1991
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,050
Archery seems so kinetic and detailed,
right?

1992
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:17,390
Boxing is more kinetic,
it's more.

1993
01:28:17,391 --> 01:28:19,890
Um,
but it was more options box.

1994
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:21,650
Yeah.
There's a lot of strategy.

1995
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:24,230
There's a lot of split second timing.
There's a lot of,

1996
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,120
uh,
getting your opponent to.

1997
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:27,870
You're fooling him.
Really.

1998
01:28:27,871 --> 01:28:31,010
You're getting to think you're doing one
thing and then capitalizing on,

1999
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:32,600
on,
on sort of a.

2000
01:28:32,601 --> 01:28:34,610
you're saying,
I thought I was doing this and I'm doing

2001
01:28:34,611 --> 01:28:35,120
this.
You know,

2002
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:37,370
there's a different kind of thing.
But what I,

2003
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:40,760
what I love about all of it is almost 
like,

2004
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:43,040
it's not even so much about the doing of
it,

2005
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:45,140
of itself.
It's always awesome.

2006
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:50,141
But I think what I really get off on 
sometimes is the discovery is the PR is 

2007
01:28:51,361 --> 01:28:56,361
the learning maybe how to control 
something that seems so out of control 

2008
01:28:56,361 --> 01:28:56,361
and,
and,

2009
01:28:56,361 --> 01:29:01,090
and sort of the discovery,
the continual discovery of new things 

2010
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,080
and maybe what it does to my brain.

2011
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,720
Like maybe,
maybe that's what I like,

2012
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:10,730
like the,
the mindset it puts me in and the 

2013
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:14,421
understanding it gives me and maybe even
the fact that it takes away the,

2014
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:20,120
some of the mystery I was living under,
which I felt was a little learning one 

2015
01:29:20,461 --> 01:29:22,670
new thing.
Now that one new thing is unearthed.

2016
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,390
No,
understand that a little bit better.

2017
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:25,830
You've got a little bit more data.
Yeah.

2018
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:28,860
And then now I'm not as intimidated by 
anything.

2019
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:30,510
Like,
I mean somebody who is quote unquote,

2020
01:29:30,511 --> 01:29:35,511
really smart and good at one thing,
whether it's a surgeon or a brain 

2021
01:29:35,511 --> 01:29:37,200
surgeon or a scientist or a really good 
fighter.

2022
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:42,530
Well a really good fighter.
I've talked to Joe Schilling about this 

2023
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:42,530
and to Dallas,
Ronnie about this,

2024
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:43,770
you know,
I was talking about patterns I'd come up

2025
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:45,510
with is I was talking about this pattern
I had and he goes,

2026
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:45,780
yeah.

2027
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,310
And she was showing said,
so we'd have.

2028
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:52,590
So the differences,
I probably have 30 of those patterns 

2029
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:52,590
that I,
that I have deepened my memory.

2030
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:54,650
It's like Roberta Duran,
I can't remember who was fighting him,

2031
01:29:54,651 --> 01:29:59,651
but he came back and he said the fucking
guy can read my mind and as I think it 

2032
01:29:59,651 --> 01:30:00,450
was,
his trainer said,

2033
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:05,451
he's not reading your mind.
What he's doing is that he knows those 

2034
01:30:05,451 --> 01:30:08,100
patterns so well and he sees you about 
the set him up and he's,

2035
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:10,170
and he's beating you to it,
you know,

2036
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,950
and when I watched a Henner gracie tie 
up,

2037
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:19,220
tie up the likes of Brendan Schaub and 
Leo Machida and all kinds of guys in 

2038
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:24,111
there.
And I watched him just do whatever you 

2039
01:30:24,111 --> 01:30:24,111
wanted.
Starting to his back.

2040
01:30:24,111 --> 01:30:24,111
And I was like,
I was like,

2041
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:24,900
dude,
you're,

2042
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:29,960
you're anticipating their movements.
You are already see what their patterns 

2043
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,030
are because you're ahead of them.

2044
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:33,840
And it takes a little bit.
You're not going to be as reverential.

2045
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:38,841
You're going to be.
You're going to love the fact that life 

2046
01:30:38,841 --> 01:30:38,841
is that way,
that the universe can be that way,

2047
01:30:38,841 --> 01:30:42,990
that if you practice something enough 
and you get good enough at something,

2048
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:46,980
it can seem like what you do is magic 
almost right,

2049
01:30:46,981 --> 01:30:51,981
but it's not.
It's just that you have learned how to 

2050
01:30:51,981 --> 01:30:54,831
chunk large portions of information and 
you will learn how to be ahead of 

2051
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:57,570
somebody and more importantly,
when you play somebody at the same game,

2052
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:03,020
you're going to see the tendencies,
they're going to make tendencies and 

2053
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:06,591
you're gonna beat them to.
Those tendencies can be able to head 

2054
01:31:06,591 --> 01:31:06,591
them off.
Why?

2055
01:31:06,591 --> 01:31:09,530
Because you've been there a thousand 
times because you went through the same 

2056
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:13,101
thing and the difference between your 
practicing beginner mind and your 

2057
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:16,650
mastery mind in that context is vastly 
different.

2058
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,610
And I can always tell somebody who's 
mastered something versus somebody who's

2059
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:23,250
never taken the time to really get good 
at something.

2060
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:27,570
I can always tell the difference and I 
prefer to be around.

2061
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:29,370
Not always.
Not always,

2062
01:31:29,371 --> 01:31:31,800
because I got some real more on friends 
that are so much fun,

2063
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:37,040
but I typically tend to find more 
intimacy in conversation with people 

2064
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:41,610
that have least continue to endeavor 
down the road to mastery.

2065
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,320
Well,
there's very few people that can talk to

2066
01:31:43,321 --> 01:31:44,240
them,
you know,

2067
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,290
if you're,
if you're to talk to a real master about

2068
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:46,860
something,
you know,

2069
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,290
pull someone aside and talk to them 
about their craft,

2070
01:31:49,291 --> 01:31:52,590
about achieving incredibly high level at
a very difficult discipline.

2071
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:56,190
Like a master chess player for instance.
How many people did they have to talk to

2072
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,470
see if Gary Kasparov is,
uh,

2073
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:03,710
at a.
and somebody wants to have a 

2074
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:05,761
conversation with him about food stamps 
or fucking Hollywood gossip,

2075
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:07,330
Hollywood gossip,
right?

2076
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,680
Whatever happened to Taylor swift and 
like,

2077
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,730
that kind of shit.
He says,

2078
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:12,640
hang inaccurate oculus.
Like,

2079
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:15,280
I can't believe what John did like.
So he was.

2080
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:18,670
So I was walking down and then he said I
was going to grab this package.

2081
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:23,671
And he added or someone's next to him 
and it's Sam Harris and Sam Harris and 

2082
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:27,230
Gary Kasparov have this deep,
intense conversation that,

2083
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:30,640
that fills a void inside of their souls,
fills them up.

2084
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:35,780
Right.
And it's really hard to find someone 

2085
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:37,270
that can play ping pong with you,
like intellectually at that level.

2086
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:42,420
Well,
because it maybe it goes back to the 

2087
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:42,420
same,
same thing we were talking about.

2088
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,791
They're about to have a real discussion 
and they're not as attached to their 

2089
01:32:44,791 --> 01:32:44,791
prejudices,
right?

2090
01:32:44,791 --> 01:32:46,450
Because they tend to be like Sam Harris 
is like,

2091
01:32:46,451 --> 01:32:48,250
if you listened to Sam Harris talk about
trump.

2092
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:51,400
His critique is so fair.
It's so.

2093
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:56,670
It's so interesting.
Like he's got these great metaphors and 

2094
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:57,670
stuff,
but it's not driven by dogma.

2095
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:01,060
It's not driven by my team is right near
team is wrong.

2096
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,130
He's,
he's able to be more objective.

2097
01:33:03,131 --> 01:33:05,200
He's more humble.
Like Wayne McCullough,

2098
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:07,210
who's might my trainer,
my boxing trainer,

2099
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:07,780
like,
you know,

2100
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,360
a former world champion he's been 
through.

2101
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:14,130
When you're a world champion like that,
he's the most humble motherfucker on the

2102
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:15,000
planet.
He's,

2103
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:17,780
he'll hold mitts for everybody.
Clap your hands.

2104
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,860
He's the greatest guy in the world and 
he doesn't get the respect.

2105
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:21,800
Nobody knows who the,
how,

2106
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:24,400
what he accomplished as a boxer.
It drives me fucking crazy,

2107
01:33:24,401 --> 01:33:26,620
but that doesn't matter.
That fucking guy.

2108
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:29,160
He'll give you every really level headed
God.

2109
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:30,190
Amazing.
Yeah.

2110
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:32,440
Like one of my favorite people on the 
planet.

2111
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:35,220
I love that mother family was amazing 
boxer and his day,

2112
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:40,490
God,
and a great teacher in a very 

2113
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:40,490
lightweight guy.

2114
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,750
So it was lightweight guys.
The ones that have the real technical 

2115
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:43,750
skill and footwork and movement.
Yes.

2116
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,230
Yes.
So he teaches you boxing?

2117
01:33:45,231 --> 01:33:45,910
Yeah,
it's pretty cool.

2118
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:46,960
He's my.
He's my guy.

2119
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:47,730
Yeah,
man.

2120
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,570
He.
Steven moves around with me.

2121
01:33:49,571 --> 01:33:51,310
I'll put on gloves and you know,
just.

2122
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,500
It's funny how he may be small like 
that,

2123
01:33:53,501 --> 01:33:54,970
but good luck trying to hit him.
Yeah.

2124
01:33:54,971 --> 01:33:56,360
Well good luck.
Yeah.

2125
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:01,500
When he,
when he catches you in the body and you 

2126
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:01,500
make your 15 mistakes.
I love it though.

2127
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:06,241
It's so humbling.
Do you think you'll ever get to Jujitsu 

2128
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:06,241
again?
I am dying to.

2129
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:08,400
It seems to me like that one you could 
kind of.

2130
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:11,260
You could actually do it in a way where 
you're not going to get hurt.

2131
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:15,610
That's the big difference between 
striking and wrestling and grappling.

2132
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:20,611
I love grappling.
It's what I started with and I miss it 

2133
01:34:20,611 --> 01:34:20,611
and I love it.

2134
01:34:20,611 --> 01:34:24,810
I liked the way it makes my body feel 
and everything else and grappling like 

2135
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:25,210
Jujitsu,
you can get really good and you can roll

2136
01:34:25,211 --> 01:34:28,120
with top level guys when you box and if 
you want to get good,

2137
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:30,640
you got to spar and every time I spar 
with,

2138
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:35,700
you know,
I'm not sparring tough guys and I'm 

2139
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,141
sparring pros like my buddy Brandon 
Adams who can do whatever he wants to 

2140
01:34:37,141 --> 01:34:40,141
me.
He just moving around with me and 

2141
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:40,141
touched me.
It's great.

2142
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:40,141
I learned you're still getting hit.
It's still going to get hit.

2143
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:45,160
You can still gonna take a couple shots 
and if you fight somebody who's like 

2144
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:45,520
your level,
somebody's going to get,

2145
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:47,020
that's when you actually get hurt,
right?

2146
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:49,690
Because you know I'm not,
I don't want to lose.

2147
01:34:49,691 --> 01:34:54,691
You don't want to lose.
Even though I'm 50 and I'm an idiot for 

2148
01:34:54,691 --> 01:34:54,691
doing this,
I'm still going to.

2149
01:34:54,691 --> 01:34:56,620
I still try to hold onto my fucking,
you know,

2150
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:59,000
Blah Blah.
We'll just move around and tell you,

2151
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:02,370
catch me and then I'm going to try to 
catch it stings and your.

2152
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,970
I would prefer not to do it.
It's nerve wracking.

2153
01:35:04,971 --> 01:35:06,410
You know who loves it?
Lucy Kay.

2154
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:07,910
He likes to box.
Yup.

2155
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:09,910
No Shit.
Giant boxing fan too.

2156
01:35:09,911 --> 01:35:11,730
So that all the big.
Does he spar Louis?

2157
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,250
Just wow.
Yeah.

2158
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:15,320
He and I had a pretty deep conversation 
about boxing,

2159
01:35:15,321 --> 01:35:18,770
like he's a fucking real boxing fan when
we were talking about guys like terrence

2160
01:35:18,771 --> 01:35:21,020
Crawford or like,
oh look at you.

2161
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,360
Yeah,
he loves it.

2162
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:28,450
I just watched Tommy hearns fight with 
Hagler fight with sugar ray.

2163
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:31,280
Holy Shit.
And hearns fight with Doran.

2164
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:32,330
I do.
That's my thing.

2165
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:33,770
I go,
I watch,

2166
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:35,780
say think you can dance the best of so 
he can.

2167
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:39,020
Thinking that's the voice.
I cry my private,

2168
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:44,110
my little private garden and then I 
watch old boxing bouts and it's my 

2169
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:49,241
favorite thing and I watched interviews 
with them now interviews with Tommy 

2170
01:35:49,241 --> 01:35:50,530
hearns and that Jabba his.

2171
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:51,380
Oh,
it was amazing.

2172
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:56,470
Oh my God.
Do you ever see his fight with Roberto 

2173
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:56,470
Duran?
Sure did.

2174
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:59,960
Sure did.
He was one of the first guys to 

2175
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:00,470
flatline.
A guy like Roberto Duran.

2176
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:03,260
Just leave are laid out the first round.
Second round.

2177
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:04,250
I think it was the second.
Yeah,

2178
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:05,780
second round.
It's hard to remember,

2179
01:36:05,781 --> 01:36:09,440
but it was around two.
He hit him like a pistol compliant.

2180
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:11,660
Six one.
One 45.

2181
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:14,480
This is ridiculous.
And he was wide,

2182
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:19,400
so wide torque behind the punches.
I liked Roger Mayweather fight,

2183
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,890
uh,
in his prime black Mamba Dude.

2184
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,160
And he had legs that were about as 
skinny as toothpick.

2185
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:27,020
Well,
they look like nine x cables.

2186
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,300
They're just like these tiny.
I've never seen anything like it.

2187
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:31,180
Good luck finding him too.
Yeah,

2188
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:34,340
there's hearns flat over bird around.
Look at that picture.

2189
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,610
He was a giant 45,
but yeah,

2190
01:36:37,611 --> 01:36:39,170
he was.
I think in this time though,

2191
01:36:39,171 --> 01:36:40,130
he was 54.

2192
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:45,520
I think you went up to 54.
That was a because Roberto Duran had 

2193
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,600
beaten Davey Moore and I think that was 
at 54.

2194
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:50,090
Was it at 60?
Because Roberto follow all the way up to

2195
01:36:50,091 --> 01:36:51,530
Hagler.
He's my favorite.

2196
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,360
Roberto Duran was my favorite fighter 
jet.

2197
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:56,840
I just.
His attitude like the human pit bull,

2198
01:36:56,841 --> 01:36:58,480
the stair,
how much he loves fire.

2199
01:36:58,510 --> 01:37:00,530
Hearns is than him.
Good Lord.

2200
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,310
Different,
different.

2201
01:37:01,311 --> 01:37:03,210
Literally a different looking human 
beings.

2202
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:05,090
Yeah.
Look at that picture of him jabbing them

2203
01:37:05,091 --> 01:37:07,120
right there.
David and Goliath right there.

2204
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:10,370
Fucking.
He's a large fellow.

2205
01:37:10,371 --> 01:37:13,640
Tommy hearns and Duran.
Loved to fight.

2206
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:18,850
He.
He needed to stay the fuck away from 

2207
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:18,850
microphones to.
Yeah.

2208
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:22,790
Perhaps that whole talking things over.
Then I watched some hagler.

2209
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:24,810
I watched some marvelous Marvin Hagler.
Oh,

2210
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:26,120
he was amazing.
Marvelous.

2211
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:26,760
Margaret.
I,

2212
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:31,810
I still to this day maintain that.
Gross should have won that fight with 

2213
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:31,810
sugar ray Leonard started,
I think,

2214
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:34,430
enough to win.
He's just touching them.

2215
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:35,630
I agree.
One hundred percent.

2216
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:39,350
How do you think the big questions are?
People ask these but Connecticut,

2217
01:37:39,351 --> 01:37:41,390
Lufkin with Hagler.
Um,

2218
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:42,110
you know,
these kinds of.

2219
01:37:42,111 --> 01:37:47,111
We'll never know.
We'll never get the real question is 

2220
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:47,111
what's Gennady Golovkin going to do it 
with Canelo Alvarez.

2221
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:48,750
Floyd mayweather things.
Canelo Alvarez.

2222
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:53,090
Gonna Knock Lufkin out.
I think Lufkin is bigger,

2223
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,500
taller,
longer.

2224
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,120
He hits bit as hard.
Um,

2225
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:00,630
and I think,
I think it's a little much for Canelo.

2226
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:05,820
I'm interested.
I want to see what Gennady and Andre 

2227
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:05,850
Ward would have.
What would the thing is,

2228
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:09,420
did you see the fight with Kell Brooks?
Kell Brooks had some serious moments.

2229
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:11,460
He did.
He made the human.

2230
01:38:11,461 --> 01:38:13,140
But the problem was,
from what I understand,

2231
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:15,930
you also had a bad flu.
Yes.

2232
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,860
Oh really?
Yes.

2233
01:38:16,861 --> 01:38:18,470
He had a bad flu.
Will that change?

2234
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:22,510
And then can I proceeded to break it?
Kells,

2235
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:27,530
uh,
I think orbital socket and beat him up 

2236
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:30,050
eventually.
But the thing is as fucking hell of a 

2237
01:38:30,050 --> 01:38:30,050
hell of a fighter.
Yeah.

2238
01:38:30,050 --> 01:38:34,820
But the thing is,
Kell Brooks is not Canelo Canelo's a 

2239
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:35,790
murderous one punch knockout artists.
You know,

2240
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:37,710
it's,
it's a totally different experience.

2241
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:40,590
Like Canelo can flat line people and he 
does it.

2242
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:45,650
He does it with bombs.
So the question is whether or not he'll 

2243
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:46,680
ever be able to get one of those bombs 
off.

2244
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:48,600
Well,
if you watch them with Amir Khan,

2245
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:50,640
he would keep,
he'd fake loan,

2246
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:51,930
He Jab,
Jab,

2247
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,280
Jab,
logo,

2248
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,980
and it didn't work like eight times.
And then finally Chad Lowe,

2249
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:57,510
boom.

2250
01:38:57,510 --> 01:39:00,600
And just came to the top and just knock 
them out that that's.

2251
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:03,780
I think that's one of his Mane Gotu 
shots.

2252
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,670
I don't know.
Again,

2253
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,630
that is a different animal.
Totally different animal,

2254
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:07,220
you know?
Yeah.

2255
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:09,210
I mean he has a way better chin,
but he also.

2256
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,680
He also makes you pay for things.
You throw his,

2257
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:14,030
his counters when you get hit,
you know,

2258
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,940
my friends are heavyweight at box and 
burn.

2259
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:21,020
I'm David.
And he used to spar with him and 

2260
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:21,020
wherever he'd wear a body suit when he's
the.

2261
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:24,320
With Godaddy for a small box and burn.
Change your name change.

2262
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:25,890
It's doing very well.
No,

2263
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:26,120
no,
no.

2264
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:28,230
It's boxing gym.

2265
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:32,640
I mean,
seriously.

2266
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:36,960
It's like you have boxing mixed with 
like Jane Fonda workouts.

2267
01:39:36,961 --> 01:39:39,260
Do you feel the burn guy?
Real fighters and they're real actors,

2268
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,670
get some serious actors to get real 
actress.

2269
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:43,740
Oh yeah.
Oh my goodness.

2270
01:39:43,741 --> 01:39:48,180
Is that why you're there?
Love works with Wayne McCullough.

2271
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,100
I'm burning.
Hey,

2272
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:57,200
that's my boy's gym.
It's a great challenge in my calves are 

2273
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,220
burning on this.
Don't do that.

2274
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:02,540
That's not how we do it though.
What are you doing?

2275
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:04,590
Skipping rope.
I've never seen a that way.

2276
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:06,330
Your nipples.
I can see your nipples.

2277
01:40:06,331 --> 01:40:09,150
See your shirt and I'm getting a little.
It's an amazing gym.

2278
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:11,520
It's an amazing gym so that when you go 
like this,

2279
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:18,080
I can lift weights and have a hard time 
breathing.

2280
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:22,470
Yeah,
that's way to have a hard time.

2281
01:40:22,471 --> 01:40:25,680
Every lifts weights and hyperventilate.
If you had a gym called lift weights and

2282
01:40:25,681 --> 01:40:26,280
hyperventilate.

2283
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,330
Really funny.
Everybody be like,

2284
01:40:27,331 --> 01:40:30,550
what the fuck kind of name for a gym is 
this boxing burn,

2285
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,810
burning it rit band at fucking roof off 
this bitch.

2286
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,460
Well,
you're not gonna.

2287
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:39,740
You're not going to be able to make 
money in a gym if you just have box and 

2288
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:40,110
good luck opening a gym.
We just teach you how to fight.

2289
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,210
You get six people to show out that we 
liked.

2290
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:45,810
We liked it.
We teach the class.

2291
01:40:45,811 --> 01:40:50,811
It is a good place for dudes who like 
the box and then smoke some weed and 

2292
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:52,950
chill out afterwards.
Box and burn workout.

2293
01:40:52,951 --> 01:40:55,090
And do you ever get high before you work
out?

2294
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:56,170
Never.
Never have.

2295
01:40:56,260 --> 01:41:01,260
That seems odd.
I was in boxing Ireland time and I was 

2296
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:03,460
dead lifting a 1:45
for reps though for Reps.

2297
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:05,440
and hold it over your head or a.
well,

2298
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:06,450
again,
I was looking at skinny,

2299
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:07,450
my,
my third,

2300
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:08,090
my,
my,

2301
01:41:08,091 --> 01:41:09,830
uh,
my uh,

2302
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,570
arm was good to get some iron man and 
kettlebells Mulan those bits.

2303
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:17,700
Well I've been,
I've been taking a weight lifting class 

2304
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:17,700
which we can get into.
I liked that very much.

2305
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:19,060
So we talk about that on it,
uh,

2306
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,520
ironman thing.
But um,

2307
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:27,270
I'm,
I'm deadlifting and Tim Teebo and 

2308
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:27,270
Brendan Schaub Walk in behind me.
Oh boy.

2309
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:30,580
And I got embarrassed and I put it down.
Don't work out when I'm talking.

2310
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:33,970
I sort of sweating.
I sweat a lot.

2311
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:37,040
I drink a lot of water and very hydrated
for the whole,

2312
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,220
like what they're saying,
I'm just going to start lifting.

2313
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:44,610
It's okay because I don't know because 
I'm just talking about dead lifting in 

2314
01:41:44,610 --> 01:41:45,820
front of those guys at 1:45.
That's impressive.

2315
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,670
Have you tried to Max out?
No.

2316
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:51,700
No,
I don't Max out,

2317
01:41:51,701 --> 01:41:52,720
man.
What do you think?

2318
01:41:52,721 --> 01:41:54,820
If you really had to,
what do you think you could bench?

2319
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,390
Uh,
I used to do what's three plates?

2320
01:41:57,391 --> 01:41:57,690
Three.
Oh,

2321
01:41:57,691 --> 01:42:02,691
five.
Three slash five slash three slash 15 

2322
01:42:02,691 --> 01:42:02,691
was 2:25
and 95?

2323
01:42:02,691 --> 01:42:02,691
Yeah,
I could do three.

2324
01:42:02,691 --> 01:42:03,720
Oh,
five for three or four?

2325
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:05,460
Three 52 plates?
Yeah.

2326
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:06,240
Oh,
is that what it is?

2327
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:07,620
Okay.
That's a lot of weight.

2328
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,300
Yeah.
Yeah,

2329
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:11,220
I can do that.
Have you ever tried to dead lift Max?

2330
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,070
Um,
no,

2331
01:42:14,071 --> 01:42:18,690
never did left at Max,
but I would work out with 4:50.

2332
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,840
So what does that work out you deadlift 
for 50?

2333
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,120
Yeah,
I did look for 50.

2334
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:28,160
You work out with 450 pounds.
Four hundred 50 pounds a fuck load of 

2335
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:28,160
weight.
What do you mean?

2336
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:30,590
It's not that much weight on a crossbar,
but it's a,

2337
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:32,340
it's on a straight bar.
What kind of bar?

2338
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,760
Those ones?
Just stand inside those hexagon bars and

2339
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:35,590
grabbed the side.
Yeah,

2340
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:37,290
that's,
that's a fuck load of weight.

2341
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:38,520
What are you talking about?
Strong as fuck,

2342
01:42:38,521 --> 01:42:39,810
Bro.
Yeah.

2343
01:42:39,811 --> 01:42:43,050
That's been dead deadlifting for a long 
time.

2344
01:42:43,410 --> 01:42:48,410
You know,
I started out dead lifting to 25 and 

2345
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:51,171
then I went up to three plates and now I
four plates a little bit more.

2346
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:55,870
You know,
it's total nine plates plus the bars.

2347
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:00,600
Well he's twenty five cents.
That's a fuck little weight.

2348
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:05,690
Yeah,
but only do it for like two or three 

2349
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:05,690
reps.
what I want,

2350
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:08,720
what I believe is that when you get to a
certain proficiency at lifting right 

2351
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,410
then and only then should you lift 
heavy,

2352
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:14,100
right?
You've,

2353
01:43:14,101 --> 01:43:17,970
you've built up like a good solid base.
Then only then should you live to heavy.

2354
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:23,030
And I follow like the Tat Salini 
Protocol where like say if I can do 10 

2355
01:43:25,561 --> 01:43:27,510
reps or something,
I never do 10,

2356
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:32,540
I do five.
So like if I get to like if I'm doing 

2357
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:36,081
something heavy,
like I'm doing 90 pound clean press 

2358
01:43:37,081 --> 01:43:39,240
squats where I'm holding 90 pounds over 
my head,

2359
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:43,540
I could probably do 10 of those,
but I only do for so.

2360
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,890
So you don't go to muscle atrophy?
I don't go to failure.

2361
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:50,400
I don't believe in going to failure,
but I think is the best off.

2362
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:53,480
Doing less,
less repetitions,

2363
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:58,510
more often,
so instead of doing one day when you 

2364
01:43:58,510 --> 01:43:59,220
blow your whole fucking system out and 
he'd do

2365
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,700
one more bro,
come on one more

2366
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:03,890
the next day you could barely walk,
right?

2367
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:06,580
I think,
and this is what Paul says,

2368
01:44:06,581 --> 01:44:09,730
and this is what a lot of people like A.
There's a company called strong first.

2369
01:44:09,731 --> 01:44:14,731
What they recommend this like there's a 
few people at the front of the line when

2370
01:44:16,001 --> 01:44:20,770
it comes to what you would call a 
functional fitness functional strength,

2371
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:24,210
right?
And they think that public halls,

2372
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:28,150
greasing the groove,
which means do it more often,

2373
01:44:28,690 --> 01:44:33,690
but do it not to failure.
So instead of having one workout every 

2374
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:35,230
three days,
we below your body,

2375
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:40,260
I have one workout every day and you 
don't blow your body and you'll get 

2376
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:40,390
stronger core.
Stimulate,

2377
01:44:40,391 --> 01:44:41,320
done,
and not la.

2378
01:44:41,410 --> 01:44:44,190
Exactly.
There's no reason in pincher creek where

2379
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,280
you can go to failure.
Yeah.

2380
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,620
Why would you go to failure in nature?
You wouldn't.

2381
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:52,920
So how does how,
how to how to animals and people and 

2382
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:56,191
farmers.
How do they get strong farmers and get 

2383
01:44:56,191 --> 01:44:56,191
ridiculously fucking strong from going 
to failure?

2384
01:44:56,191 --> 01:45:00,811
Every day they get ridiculously strong 
from consistently taxing their body 

2385
01:45:00,811 --> 01:45:03,640
moving bails of Hay,
picking up heavy things.

2386
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:05,260
I mean,
you do that consistently.

2387
01:45:05,370 --> 01:45:06,700
Make it stronger and stronger.
Yeah.

2388
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,710
Yeah.
So that's mostly what I do.

2389
01:45:08,711 --> 01:45:11,380
So if I dead lift heavy,
which I rarely do,

2390
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,360
that's what I do.
And I only do it for a few rep.

2391
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:13,360
it's

2392
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:17,180
so funny because I did a scene with Matt
Hughes on Kingdom that show that I recur

2393
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:19,820
on and uh,
I kinda grabbed him.

2394
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:20,870
Oh,
he's a gorilla.

2395
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:23,040
I just grabbed them.
I joke around,

2396
01:45:23,041 --> 01:45:24,680
I'll wrestle with him and I was a high 
school wrestling.

2397
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:25,850
I'm,
I've got my elbows in,

2398
01:45:25,851 --> 01:45:28,790
I'm moving in on him and he swatted the 
back of my head.

2399
01:45:28,791 --> 01:45:30,110
Just kind of grabbed the back of my 
head.

2400
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:32,110
He swatter like,
I was like,

2401
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:34,420
oh my God.
Oh my God.

2402
01:45:34,421 --> 01:45:39,421
I tried to keep.
I tried to pull my neck up and I was 

2403
01:45:39,421 --> 01:45:41,360
like,
that's not going to work with Matt 

2404
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:41,360
stronger than me.
What a surprise.

2405
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:41,750
You will imagine if fertility with like 
a heavyweight.

2406
01:45:41,751 --> 01:45:46,751
Then imagine what it's like getting the 
back of your neck grabbed by Cain 

2407
01:45:46,751 --> 01:45:46,751
Velasquez.
I wrestled with Photoshop.

2408
01:45:46,810 --> 01:45:49,370
Sometimes it becomes a disaster.
It's so.

2409
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:50,480
It's so bad.

2410
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:51,860
It's ridiculous.
It is.

2411
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:53,600
And then know that,
know this,

2412
01:45:53,601 --> 01:45:56,660
that there's guys out there that would 
ragdoll hint that it's so weird.

2413
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,400
Yeah.
It's so fucking weird.

2414
01:45:58,401 --> 01:46:01,610
It gets so great areas if you think 
equality exists in nature.

2415
01:46:01,611 --> 01:46:03,680
I got news for you to do a sport.
Come wrestle.

2416
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:05,290
I grabbed,
I said to Brendan,

2417
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:07,730
we were about to go do a live show and 
speaking of which,

2418
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,280
speaking of which,
January 18th,

2419
01:46:10,290 --> 01:46:11,690
19th,
Vancouver,

2420
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:13,130
20th,
Seattle,

2421
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:16,490
21 a portland.
And uh,

2422
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:18,310
and then we got,
then we got.

2423
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:23,340
Then we got San Francisco,
February ninth and 10th get your 

2424
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:23,340
tickets.
But,

2425
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:24,140
but we were about to do a show,
a live show.

2426
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:26,840
And I go,
I look at him and all I said he was just

2427
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:27,860
feeling.
He was just,

2428
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:30,080
he had an energy.
He started pinching at me,

2429
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:31,370
start pinching at me.
I'm like,

2430
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:36,580
Hey,
stop pitching it with giant fucking 

2431
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:36,580
palms.

2432
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:36,580
And he's like,
he's jumping around.

2433
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:36,580
And I go,
dude,

2434
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:41,530
I gotta be honest with you,
don't fuck around because I box now a 

2435
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:41,530
lot.
And he goes,

2436
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:43,610
you do?
I don't know all bullshit aside.

2437
01:46:43,611 --> 01:46:45,320
I jam guys now when they,
when they,

2438
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:46,570
when they got to get something else,
something,

2439
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:47,720
I'll just jam you.
And he goes,

2440
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,560
Oh,
what show me?

2441
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:50,760
And I go,
well,

2442
01:46:50,761 --> 01:46:54,390
so if we're fighting and I get in you,
and he goes like that and I'm in here.

2443
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:55,770
And he goes,
what if I do this?

2444
01:46:55,771 --> 01:47:00,771
And he hits me in the side just he just 
slapped my little tummy and the side 

2445
01:47:00,771 --> 01:47:04,341
like that.
And then he kicks me in the leg just 

2446
01:47:04,341 --> 01:47:04,341
very lightly.
And I went.

2447
01:47:04,341 --> 01:47:04,341
I go,
Oh,

2448
01:47:04,341 --> 01:47:05,120
oh,
I don't like this at all.

2449
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:05,760
He goes,
what?

2450
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,170
And he goes,
what if I go like this?

2451
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:08,160
And he goes to do a double.

2452
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,530
Like He.
All he did was step forward and I'm such

2453
01:47:10,531 --> 01:47:11,970
a bitch that,
that,

2454
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:15,030
that little,
those little tabs got me so on edge that

2455
01:47:15,031 --> 01:47:16,860
I through my,
instead of sprawling,

2456
01:47:16,861 --> 01:47:21,480
naturally I threw my body backwards.
I like the way the way you would do like

2457
01:47:21,481 --> 01:47:24,720
when a girl sees a Rockstar,
she goes like the stereotypical,

2458
01:47:24,721 --> 01:47:29,721
like in the movies in the fifties.
I throw my body back and I hit my 

2459
01:47:29,721 --> 01:47:33,450
forearm so hard on the fucking door jam 
and I gave myself a deep,

2460
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,320
deep forearm bruise that I had to 
perform through.

2461
01:47:37,370 --> 01:47:39,110
It was tough for me.
You have to know.

2462
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:41,010
I was very funny.
He's a big guy.

2463
01:47:41,011 --> 01:47:42,870
You're a smaller guy.
The point is that it is.

2464
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:44,470
I know what it's like to wrestle with a 
gorilla.

2465
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,500
Yeah,
there's different size people at there.

2466
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:51,280
Now imagine if you're a girl and imagine
that guy is a butcher smile.

2467
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:53,280
I do it all the time.
Then you understand dude,

2468
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:57,060
how rose McCallum fields sexist shit.
Circle motherfucker.

2469
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:02,120
I brought all the way back around.
I was very good at it because you could 

2470
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:02,120
do that too.
Rose McGowan.

2471
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,600
Tell me he couldn't.
If he kicked her.

2472
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:04,260
Yeah,
I've,

2473
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:06,450
I've never wanted to.
You could fuck rose McGowan up.

2474
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:11,500
Probably.
Could I probably ugly frozen Miguel and 

2475
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:14,691
try to kick your ass.
If you're on a beach and you're 

2476
01:48:14,691 --> 01:48:17,121
competing for coconuts,
she was deciding the you didn't deserve 

2477
01:48:17,121 --> 01:48:17,121
a coconut.
Oh,

2478
01:48:17,121 --> 01:48:18,240
I'd be such a Beta male.
I'd be like,

2479
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:19,810
let me put you into.
I'd be like a cleanser,

2480
01:48:19,811 --> 01:48:24,811
a fucking tree for you right now.
How long do you think you'd have to go 

2481
01:48:24,811 --> 01:48:28,011
before?
You don't have to yell at her if you 

2482
01:48:28,011 --> 01:48:28,011
were on an island?
That's a very good question.

2483
01:48:28,011 --> 01:48:29,850
That's a very good question.
Rose McGowan on an island.

2484
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:33,450
She'd probably be very.
She'd probably be very effective.

2485
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:38,750
I would have helped.
So I think she's probably one of those 

2486
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:41,441
people is probably very focused.
She's got enough anger to drive her 

2487
01:48:41,441 --> 01:48:44,361
through.
She would decide that the community on 

2488
01:48:44,361 --> 01:48:44,361
this island is incredibly sexist.
Yeah.

2489
01:48:44,361 --> 01:48:46,260
But then she's also really sexual and 
she'd be like,

2490
01:48:46,261 --> 01:48:49,080
how old are you again?
How many squares in your stomach and why

2491
01:48:49,081 --> 01:48:51,150
do you move like a fucking cat?
You think so?

2492
01:48:51,151 --> 01:48:52,500
And I was like,
well what about this?

2493
01:48:52,501 --> 01:48:54,510
And she'd be like,
that thing can't be real.

2494
01:48:54,511 --> 01:48:58,680
And then we'd be off to the racist man.
That's optimistic.

2495
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:00,780
I'm just saying what would happen in my 
mind,

2496
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,740
I have a feeling it would be like a lot 
of yelling and then she would.

2497
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:09,030
She was the only vagina in known 
civilization and she would just run your

2498
01:49:09,031 --> 01:49:09,780
world.
Well,

2499
01:49:09,781 --> 01:49:14,781
listen,
then I let her run my world in a boat 

2500
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:15,300
would pull up to shore and be a bunch of
girls that were on a yacht,

2501
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:19,380
jumped away from this Russian mobster,
but then they get lost at sea.

2502
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:24,650
When they landed,
they landed on this island and then all 

2503
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:24,650
of a sudden she would change.
Then she'd be your girlfriend.

2504
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:29,790
Then she'd be holding hands with you or 
they're talking to you and everything 

2505
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:33,441
would change.
Just be one guy knows how to get the 

2506
01:49:33,441 --> 01:49:33,441
coconuts guy who knows how to fish with 
a stick.

2507
01:49:33,441 --> 01:49:37,390
It's right.
He knows how to get in there with the 

2508
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:37,390
fucking.
It's beer.

2509
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:37,390
Beer.
Yeah.

2510
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:37,590
Yeah.
Fish all the time.

2511
01:49:37,591 --> 01:49:39,930
No big deal.
One cloth made the exercise.

2512
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:41,820
Plenty of food here for all of us.
Yes,

2513
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:44,810
and then the girls were just a little 
bit cold and they're 10.

2514
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:47,820
We come into your tent and then don't 
know how to make fire yet.

2515
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:48,520
Right,
and they'd be like,

2516
01:49:48,521 --> 01:49:48,940
what?
What?

2517
01:49:48,941 --> 01:49:50,200
All those baby turtles?
I'm like,

2518
01:49:50,201 --> 01:49:50,610
well,
we're gonna.

2519
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:51,310
Eat Him.
No.

2520
01:49:51,311 --> 01:49:52,020
Their babies just like,
oh,

2521
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:53,280
don't worry if we don't need them.

2522
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:54,490
The fish.
Well anyway,

2523
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:56,710
and then we just fucking munch on some 
roads.

2524
01:49:56,711 --> 01:49:59,230
Just starts blowing you just while 
you're talking to them.

2525
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:03,060
Just mine.
It's mine gets super mine.

2526
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:08,130
There's this,
there's the woman who was a couples 

2527
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:09,940
therapist who recommended this to 
couples that are having problems.

2528
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:15,450
She.
There's a book that's written and she 

2529
01:50:15,450 --> 01:50:17,251
wrote a book about it.
It was essentially the idea that when 

2530
01:50:17,251 --> 01:50:17,251
you feel 100 percent secure in your 
relationship,

2531
01:50:17,251 --> 01:50:22,111
it's a bad thing for a relationship.
You should always feel like there's a 

2532
01:50:22,111 --> 01:50:25,141
little danger of your spouse strain 
because it keeps you sexually 

2533
01:50:25,271 --> 01:50:28,330
competitive.
Certainly competitives important.

2534
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:31,600
It's fucking very important to have 
those girls or her friend,

2535
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:34,940
those girls who pull up on the island in
the raft listed.

2536
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:36,570
They were roses friends really.
She.

2537
01:50:36,571 --> 01:50:41,571
She feels like they're competitors,
but they're really does strengthen the 

2538
01:50:41,571 --> 01:50:41,571
relationship that you and Rosa.

2539
01:50:41,571 --> 01:50:45,480
She needs to know.
I would never cheat on her and I don't 

2540
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:45,480
give a fuck about these Russian chicks.
I was now my.

2541
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:50,291
I may fall and stay on,
on a body part here and there because 

2542
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:50,291
the end of the day come here.
Hey,

2543
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:55,290
look at me.
I would notice that you're saying that a

2544
01:50:56,471 --> 01:51:01,471
coconut falls off your head and kills 
you and then that's really fucked up 

2545
01:51:01,471 --> 01:51:03,230
because then they're just a bunch of 
lesbians island and so hot.

2546
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:07,000
And then they come back.
Do you think rose becomes the man then?

2547
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,340
Yes.
And then she runs those Russian bitches.

2548
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,230
Fucking shaved head.
Yeah.

2549
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:15,580
But she's an actress to Russian horse.
If the hard life,

2550
01:51:15,581 --> 01:51:18,280
they've had a hard fucking life,
they've come to stab somebody,

2551
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:20,740
steal livers.
They are emotionally,

2552
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,700
uh,
I guess remote maybe for my experiment.

2553
01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:27,400
Just really vulnerable.
Yeah.

2554
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:28,780
Brian trying to make their rent.

2555
01:51:30,670 --> 01:51:33,060
I had to talk to the picture.
There's a,

2556
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:38,061
there's a funny instagram picture,
like when you see a girls partying a but

2557
01:51:38,081 --> 01:51:42,130
you don't see the guys behind them.
Like girls or like instagram,

2558
01:51:42,131 --> 01:51:46,600
girls are going off to all these far off
exotic lands and they'd taken selfies.

2559
01:51:46,601 --> 01:51:48,390
You don't see the guys that are paying 
for that.

2560
01:51:48,391 --> 01:51:49,960
Exactly right.
Fat,

2561
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:52,540
disgusting.
Old dudes on yachts.

2562
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:54,970
Exactly.
Those guys are real.

2563
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:56,550
Of course they real.
I'd be one of those guys.

2564
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:57,440
About 10 years.
Do you think.

2565
01:51:57,450 --> 01:51:58,330
So keep going.
Well,

2566
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:03,870
do you think you'll ever get to that?
Like driving around in a yacht with a 

2567
01:52:04,721 --> 01:52:05,980
bunch of prostitutes?
No,

2568
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:07,860
because.
No,

2569
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:10,780
and I've always had,
I've always wanted to a little bit and I

2570
01:52:10,781 --> 01:52:15,781
always come back to my set point,
which is you got to be a man of 

2571
01:52:15,781 --> 01:52:15,781
substance and all that.
It's,

2572
01:52:15,781 --> 01:52:20,550
it's why I never dated super like Barbie
doll girls.

2573
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:22,870
Like I would always find it a little 
embarrassing.

2574
01:52:22,871 --> 01:52:25,450
Maybe the same reason.
I never drove a really fast fancy car.

2575
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:30,960
Uh,
did something about that ostentatious 

2576
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:30,960
kind of like,
well,

2577
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:31,050
I don't know what it is.
Like I like,

2578
01:52:31,051 --> 01:52:31,580
I know.
No.

2579
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:33,770
Here's a better way of putting it.
I do.

2580
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:36,020
I want to get away from my appetites 
out.

2581
01:52:36,021 --> 01:52:38,980
I want to be moving toward map updates.
But if you're almost dead,

2582
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:44,310
okay,
if you're 75 years old and you got this 

2583
01:52:44,310 --> 01:52:46,501
big fat fucking belly filled with carbs,
just giant Buddha like belly.

2584
01:52:48,651 --> 01:52:49,790
Yeah.
And you're on,

2585
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:52,160
you know,
200 milligrams of Viagara.

2586
01:52:52,161 --> 01:52:56,620
Your ears are ringing.
Jesus Christ.

2587
01:52:56,860 --> 01:53:00,590
Dig is just a hard snake in your pants.
You just drinking martinis.

2588
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:03,200
Oh,
and you have $7,000,000,000

2589
01:53:03,201 --> 01:53:04,730
in the bank.
What are you going to do?

2590
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,860
What are you going to do besides help 
the world ba blah,

2591
01:53:06,870 --> 01:53:07,250
blah.

2592
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:09,850
Do a lot of humanitarian things.
That's all nice.

2593
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,140
But I don't want to be somebody who 
chases this sensation.

2594
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:17,210
Are you chasing a sensation or are you 
just hitting the gas and headed straight

2595
01:53:17,211 --> 01:53:17,950
for the rocks?
No,

2596
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:18,610
no,
no,

2597
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:18,780
no,
no,

2598
01:53:18,781 --> 01:53:19,250
no,
because.

2599
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:23,390
Because hitting the gas and wait for the
rest has been done too many times.

2600
01:53:23,391 --> 01:53:24,740
I've already felt that.
I've already done it.

2601
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:26,810
I want to move away from it.
There it is.

2602
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:29,030
Hold on,
let me see that when you see this.

2603
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,250
All right guys,
remember who owns the boat?

2604
01:53:33,190 --> 01:53:35,240
Look at those guys.
Look at the girls.

2605
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:36,040
Hey,
I got news for you.

2606
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:38,960
Some women find that attractive in a 
while.

2607
01:53:38,961 --> 01:53:41,450
They find the fact that those guys are 
going to buy him a bunch of shit.

2608
01:53:41,570 --> 01:53:44,300
Yeah.
Don Sterling.

2609
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:45,260
Yeah.
You know,

2610
01:53:45,261 --> 01:53:46,050
when he was,
uh,

2611
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:51,460
just had that girl shacked up who's 
Byron or Ferrari's and shit before she 

2612
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:52,130
recorded him saying racist stuff.

2613
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:54,230
Yeah.
No,

2614
01:53:54,231 --> 01:53:57,770
I think chasing,
chasing something that is,

2615
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:03,520
you know,
the idea is to get more away from that 

2616
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:03,520
and try to.
Yeah,

2617
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:03,520
no,
I get it.

2618
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,630
I get it.
But it's also a sensation.

2619
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:07,910
I mean that's all it is,
is a fun sensation.

2620
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:12,050
But,
but so as a so as wanting to be like I'm

2621
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:15,230
valued by younger people.
So when,

2622
01:54:15,231 --> 01:54:20,110
when men go after young women,
there's one side of it which is you just

2623
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:22,890
want young women are delicious and 
beautiful and you know,

2624
01:54:22,891 --> 01:54:24,290
their,
their skin and all that.

2625
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:28,010
But I think there's another 
psychological thing at play,

2626
01:54:28,011 --> 01:54:30,950
which is also the idea.
I'm 60.

2627
01:54:31,470 --> 01:54:34,520
I still got it.
She still finds me attractive.

2628
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:37,400
I still can get it up.
I can still pleased her sexually.

2629
01:54:37,401 --> 01:54:41,240
I can still hang with the 20 year old.
I can still make her happy.

2630
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:44,300
It's a way of telling yourself,
you're still alive,

2631
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:47,300
that you're still have vitality and all 
that shit,

2632
01:54:47,301 --> 01:54:48,950
and then there's the third thing which 
is,

2633
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:50,600
look at what I've accomplished.

2634
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:55,600
I can afford this shit.
This is another toy along with my car 

2635
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:59,410
and my book,
but it's all self affirmation and it's 

2636
01:54:59,410 --> 01:55:02,381
all at the end of the day,
a manifestation of probably some shit 

2637
01:55:02,381 --> 01:55:04,300
you haven't worked out,
which is still a feeling of insecurity.

2638
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:09,320
Still a hole you can't fill.
What I hope I can move with that savage 

2639
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:13,271
with a Martini in your hand,
a giant hard Dick and you've paid 30 

2640
01:55:13,271 --> 01:55:16,010
Russian hookers to hang out with you for
a month because you're your doctor found

2641
01:55:16,011 --> 01:55:17,810
a blemish on your tumor.
Well,

2642
01:55:17,811 --> 01:55:20,420
that's a different.
Some shit going down and it's growing.

2643
01:55:20,421 --> 01:55:22,420
Now it starting to cut off the supply to
your.

2644
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:24,110
Your blood.
Yeah.

2645
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:26,870
You're getting blood clots and your feet
go numb at night.

2646
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:32,140
I wonder what I would do it.
Let me think about that because let's 

2647
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:32,140
just take that.
I got him a hug.

2648
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:32,990
Give me how much time do I have?
Not much,

2649
01:55:33,390 --> 01:55:35,000
uh,
can wake up every morning.

2650
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:38,630
You set the alarm clock for 5:00
AM with creedence clearwater revival,

2651
01:55:38,631 --> 01:55:41,510
bad moon rising.
Your Papa Viagara.

2652
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:44,130
Start drinking your guts.
Enormous.

2653
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:46,440
It's definitely,
definitely have cancer.

2654
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:47,550
You know,
you have cancer.

2655
01:55:47,551 --> 01:55:49,160
There's probably some internal shit.
Go on it.

2656
01:55:49,170 --> 01:55:53,250
But your dick still gets hard and you 
still got $7,000,000,000

2657
01:55:53,251 --> 01:55:54,990
to burn through.
Your kids are calling you.

2658
01:55:54,991 --> 01:55:56,700
You look at the phone like,
fuck you.

2659
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:58,860
You're not getting any of this.
Started a school dude.

2660
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:01,140
Ah,
yeah.

2661
01:56:02,030 --> 01:56:03,300
Everyday,
everyday.

2662
01:56:03,301 --> 01:56:06,210
The grilling steaks.
Now an onboard chef.

2663
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:08,820
I call every girl Mama and Mama.
Everything is steak.

2664
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:11,970
Steak in the morning.
Who gives a fuck?

2665
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,500
Martinis and steak.
Oh yeah.

2666
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:20,600
Martinis steak and a fucking mason jar 
filled with Viagara down those fuckers 

2667
01:56:22,771 --> 01:56:24,270
all day.
Can't hear a thing.

2668
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:26,070
Ears are closed up.

2669
01:56:26,910 --> 01:56:28,590
Just a big old gray,
gray

2670
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:29,860
pubic mound.
Yeah.

2671
01:56:29,861 --> 01:56:33,340
Your head is constantly aching from the 
Viagra flowing through your veins.

2672
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:34,930
But why am I just

2673
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:40,560
good hammer?
I guess I just do some fucking.

2674
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:44,190
You've got a giant fat belly with white 
hair all over it.

2675
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:48,440
Fat White in your Dick.
Smells like cheese.

2676
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:51,550
It takes,
it takes miles like old chambers.

2677
01:56:51,770 --> 01:56:56,770
Why is not going to happen to me when 
the girls are all have those shoes with 

2678
01:56:56,770 --> 01:57:00,131
the red bottoms.
You know those shoes of the Christian 

2679
01:57:00,131 --> 01:57:00,131
Louis?
Tell us.

2680
01:57:00,131 --> 01:57:03,360
Yeah,
that's the ones because that's where I 

2681
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,400
get a hard on when I buy gifts for those
girls all have that.

2682
01:57:04,401 --> 01:57:08,000
You make them keep those shoes on and 
you fuck their mouths when they're lying

2683
01:57:08,001 --> 01:57:13,001
on their stomach so that the shoes are 
up in the air so you can see the bottom 

2684
01:57:13,001 --> 01:57:16,511
of the shoes while you bought this for 
you about this and then your heart 

2685
01:57:17,901 --> 01:57:19,570
attacks.
And then when I come

2686
01:57:19,690 --> 01:57:20,290
I go,
I go,

2687
01:57:20,350 --> 01:57:25,350
you're welcome.
And when you die they just throw you 

2688
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:25,810
overboard because he's bitches hate you 
now.

2689
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:30,990
So like he's dead.
He's finally fucking dead and now even 

2690
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:31,320
if you will,
what's in the world?

2691
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:32,470
What do I get?
Anything.

2692
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:34,280
And then nothing.
I don't get it.

2693
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:36,670
They just dragged him by his ankles and 
chuck them over the side.

2694
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,410
Wow.
The sharks come and eat them.

2695
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:41,620
They want amy.
I'm so full of full of sin.

2696
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:45,010
And just did sharks.
Sharks will eat a shoe.

2697
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:46,070
Well,
not,

2698
01:57:46,690 --> 01:57:49,150
not my thing would be turned off by your
sin.

2699
01:57:49,190 --> 01:57:49,810
You've.
You've.

2700
01:57:50,110 --> 01:57:51,360
I think so.
Really?

2701
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:53,260
I think so.
I want to leave behind a very.

2702
01:57:53,470 --> 01:57:55,840
A shredded corpse.
I want people to go.

2703
01:57:55,841 --> 01:58:00,841
That's a.
that's a good look in 90 year old right 

2704
01:58:00,841 --> 01:58:02,731
there.
If there's so much Viagra and the body 

2705
01:58:02,731 --> 01:58:04,881
of the shark,
it's a boner and the shark is just run 

2706
01:58:04,881 --> 01:58:06,970
into the ocean with a raging hard on to 
get that going through the air.

2707
01:58:07,130 --> 01:58:09,490
No sharks fly through the air.
They jump out of the water.

2708
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,460
This time it's going to jump out of 
water with his Dick.

2709
01:58:11,461 --> 01:58:13,270
Rock hard.
Why did they breach the water?

2710
01:58:13,271 --> 01:58:15,220
They know why they're having fun.
Yeah.

2711
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:17,260
I would imagine they want to see what 
it's like.

2712
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:19,140
There's fucking seals.
Yeah.

2713
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:24,150
They having a good time.
They do it when they're killing things 

2714
01:58:24,150 --> 01:58:24,190
or they want to do it.
Parasites out their skin.

2715
01:58:24,191 --> 01:58:26,440
I heard that's why whales do it.
Maybe.

2716
01:58:26,950 --> 01:58:29,140
Interesting.
That makes sense for Wales.

2717
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:30,580
God,
what a bitch that must be there.

2718
01:58:30,581 --> 01:58:33,310
Just all those lampreys if just stuck to
you.

2719
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:36,160
Do you know how long they the bowhead 
whale lives?

2720
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:38,650
No,
about 250 years.

2721
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:40,870
Do you know how long the Greenland 
Shark?

2722
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:44,320
According to carbon dating on their 
eyelids?

2723
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:46,840
No.
It's a huge shark to try.

2724
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:50,050
About almost 500 years.
Holy Shit.

2725
01:58:50,051 --> 01:58:51,130
Bring that up for a second.

2726
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:52,010
Brand theme.
Greenland.

2727
01:58:52,011 --> 01:58:57,011
You know,
they think the greenland shark might 

2728
01:58:57,011 --> 01:58:57,011
have been what people were seeing in the
loch ness.

2729
01:58:57,011 --> 01:59:01,830
Loch ness at one point in history was 
connected to the ocean and I think that 

2730
01:59:01,830 --> 01:59:01,930
that might've been the animal that was 
in there.

2731
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:04,600
That's interesting because it would live
500 years.

2732
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:06,840
Although they live in very cold water 
polo.

2733
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,800
Look at the size of that fucking thing.
Yeah.

2734
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:11,570
Now that is a.
that'll live 500 years apparently.

2735
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:16,610
Four hundred year old greenland.
Shark is the oldest verblah animal 

2736
01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:16,690
alive.
Whoa.

2737
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:19,630
What a freaky fucking animal that looks 
for a hundred years old.

2738
01:59:19,631 --> 01:59:21,610
It looks like a stone.
It looks like a stone.

2739
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:24,370
Just think about that.
Just think about that.

2740
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:29,800
Before the fucking United States was 
founded in 1776.

2741
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:34,000
This was 100 years old and that crazy.
Isn't that fucking crazy?

2742
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:38,680
That's insane.
That's insane.

2743
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:44,170
What a freaky looking animal too.
But they keep finding weirder and 

2744
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:45,520
weirder animals.
Two at the bottom of the sea.

2745
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:46,180
They do,
right?

2746
01:59:46,210 --> 01:59:47,380
Oh,
it's so amazing.

2747
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:51,730
A tribe in the Amazon,
they just found uncontacted tribe.

2748
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:53,260
The Yanomamo.
Where were they from?

2749
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:54,300
Um,
well,

2750
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:57,310
so I say Yanomamo.
That's a.

2751
01:59:57,400 --> 02:00:00,570
isn't that the tribe that Rinella went 
hunting with?

2752
02:00:00,571 --> 02:00:01,680
And Bolivia.
I,

2753
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:06,740
I know that.
I know that they're the tribe that when 

2754
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:06,740
they came back,
the anthropologists in the seventies and

2755
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:11,371
found that the ones that killed the most
men in battle with the ones that sired 

2756
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:12,730
the most children.
And when they came back in the seventies

2757
02:00:12,731 --> 02:00:17,710
and told the academic world that,
that aggression was inherent and that it

2758
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:20,000
was rewarded by females.
Oh,

2759
02:00:20,001 --> 02:00:22,180
you should've seen the politically 
correct.

2760
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:24,040
You should have seen what happened in 
the seventies.

2761
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:26,530
And that is rearing its head again 
today.

2762
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:28,390
The idea that aggression.
Wow,

2763
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:29,770
that's a crazy statement,
man.

2764
02:00:29,771 --> 02:00:34,771
So they rejected it in primitive.
People don't know that they attacked.

2765
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:36,790
There's a steven pinker's book,
the blank slate.

2766
02:00:36,791 --> 02:00:39,490
They attacked the scientist as policies 
that came back.

2767
02:00:39,491 --> 02:00:42,430
They attack them personally over it,
tried to ruin their reputations.

2768
02:00:42,830 --> 02:00:44,260
Look at how this guy's dressed.
God,

2769
02:00:44,261 --> 02:00:47,920
you kidding me right now in 2017,
you know,

2770
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,260
it's really amazing.
Isn't it crazy?

2771
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:55,290
Indian Indians.
Why the fuck do they keep calling them 

2772
02:00:55,290 --> 02:00:58,321
Indians?
I think the thing that's the aborigines 

2773
02:00:58,321 --> 02:00:59,470
like that,
that comes from that bar in Brazil's.

2774
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:00,970
Well,
it's indigenous in.

2775
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:06,390
Could you say indigenous?
Could you say Indian because of 

2776
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:06,390
indigenous or.
No,

2777
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:07,210
but that is so fascinating.
Jamie.

2778
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:09,730
Stop scrolling.
Please go back up to where I was reading

2779
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:14,750
what it was saying there.
The tribe has moved a number of times 

2780
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:17,860
since that citing a scout expert and the
regions indigenous groups.

2781
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:23,520
Morrell Mirror morels was on last 
Sunday's flight as well as previous 

2782
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,510
missions in 2008 and 2010.
That also yield.

2783
02:01:26,511 --> 02:01:30,010
Did extraordinary images.
These groups changed location every four

2784
02:01:30,011 --> 02:01:32,830
years or so.
They move around,

2785
02:01:32,831 --> 02:01:35,650
but it's the same group.
How fast is he on Amazon?

2786
02:01:35,770 --> 02:01:40,770
Amazon is amazing,
but those fucking people that are 

2787
02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:40,770
chopping down the trees are closing in 
on it.

2788
02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:42,920
Sure are less awful.
Look at that guy.

2789
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:48,310
Look at this crazy little hut.
They get the aerial view of the hub 

2790
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:51,880
where those people live.
A Thatch Hut Bach to keep the Jaguars 

2791
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:51,950
out and look at him,
man.

2792
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:53,360
What is.
What does he got?

2793
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:58,390
Tattoos all over him.
Jamie go larger on that image of him 

2794
02:01:58,390 --> 02:01:59,660
potty potty.
Wow.

2795
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:01,910
So they're getting pictures from the 
air.

2796
02:02:02,370 --> 02:02:06,350
He's got some sort of really primitive 
knife that's pictures from the air dude.

2797
02:02:06,410 --> 02:02:07,400
Yeah,
Yup.

2798
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:09,860
Yeah.
They're flying over these police shit.

2799
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:14,980
Photographer was looking for another 
area he was going back for and stumbled 

2800
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:15,470
across.
He saw that hut and then Oh,

2801
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:20,500
what's that?
Got in closer and then saw the people 

2802
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:20,960
and started taking photos of them.
These people are living like people live

2803
02:02:20,961 --> 02:02:24,680
thousands of years ago.
It's amazing.

2804
02:02:25,070 --> 02:02:27,680
So that looks like a modern knife to me 
now that I'm looking at a deeper,

2805
02:02:27,681 --> 02:02:29,720
because if you look below where he's 
holding onto it,

2806
02:02:29,721 --> 02:02:32,390
there's a wooden handle.
Lower Mckenna.

2807
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:32,830
Yeah,
the.

2808
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:36,920
It looks like a machete.
So how are they uncontacted if they have

2809
02:02:36,921 --> 02:02:38,960
a machete,
my chat,

2810
02:02:38,961 --> 02:02:42,560
then they got that from someone to look 
at this.

2811
02:02:42,561 --> 02:02:44,600
The only thing that you see on them 
that's modern though.

2812
02:02:44,601 --> 02:02:46,270
I mean he's probably holding it up.
Look up modern.

2813
02:02:46,271 --> 02:02:47,840
I am.
Motherfucker got a machete.

2814
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:50,810
They look fed and healthy pot pot plots 
of corn.

2815
02:02:50,811 --> 02:02:53,040
MANIOC and banana surround the cluster 
of communal have to be,

2816
02:02:53,041 --> 02:02:54,090
again,
probably not.

2817
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:58,430
No know they eat a lot of frogs and 
monkeys,

2818
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:00,010
the deed,
everything that they'll.

2819
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:00,860
Dude,
look at that.

2820
02:03:00,861 --> 02:03:05,861
They live in the woods.
We look at this equally impressive for 

2821
02:03:05,861 --> 02:03:09,161
morale.
Murals was the large barrage of arrows 

2822
02:03:09,161 --> 02:03:12,611
that tribes are fired at the helicopter,
which he took as a healthy site of 

2823
02:03:12,611 --> 02:03:13,160
resistance.
Wow.

2824
02:03:13,161 --> 02:03:18,161
Their messages.
He said those arrows mean leave us in 

2825
02:03:18,161 --> 02:03:18,161
peace.
Do not disturb.

2826
02:03:18,161 --> 02:03:18,860
No,
they mean I'm trying to shoot you bitch.

2827
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:21,110
You know,
leave us in peace.

2828
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:22,380
That's not.
Boy,

2829
02:03:22,390 --> 02:03:24,530
you're reading into it too saying.
Get outta here.

2830
02:03:24,531 --> 02:03:26,090
You Flying Demon.
Hold on.

2831
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:31,120
Let me see here.
To save cross the border of Peru are 

2832
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:36,300
rife with illegal logging crews,
called prospect has and drug 

2833
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:36,300
traffickers.
Yeah,

2834
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:37,940
man,
they hire tribes in the past.

2835
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:43,030
I'm sure.
I mean how many of these people are 

2836
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:43,030
there?
Go back up to those images.

2837
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:44,420
Jamie,
look at the images of the hut please.

2838
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:46,520
Well yeah,
right there dude.

2839
02:03:46,521 --> 02:03:48,170
I want to study.
How many people are that?

2840
02:03:48,290 --> 02:03:53,290
I mean that's the.
If you assume that doorway is a human 

2841
02:03:53,290 --> 02:03:53,660
sized,
how many people live in that?

2842
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:54,560
Twenty.
Thirty.

2843
02:03:54,561 --> 02:03:57,770
It's fascinating.
You can learn so much about human nature

2844
02:03:57,771 --> 02:03:59,250
by studying them,
but there's no,

2845
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:00,860
there's no way to really study them 
though.

2846
02:04:00,861 --> 02:04:05,861
That's what's really interesting.
Like would really the real way to study 

2847
02:04:05,861 --> 02:04:09,071
them live.
We have a drone that they didn't know 

2848
02:04:09,071 --> 02:04:12,160
was a drone and fly it in there and like
perched on a tree and watch and get as 

2849
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,100
much data as you can and just live with 
them.

2850
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:18,220
Yeah.
But if you live with them you'll be 

2851
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:18,220
affecting them because then people,
they would know that you're there.

2852
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:22,810
Like the only way to really study them.
It would be the study them without them 

2853
02:04:22,810 --> 02:04:23,030
knowing you know,
like look where they are.

2854
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,100
Go back there,
go back and all that shit.

2855
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,020
Don't change pictures,
go back to that picture,

2856
02:04:27,021 --> 02:04:32,021
look at that,
look at the little hut and then look at 

2857
02:04:32,021 --> 02:04:32,021
where they are,
man.

2858
02:04:32,021 --> 02:04:32,360
Fuck.
Look at that.

2859
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:37,380
Nice Green,
massive amount of rain forest and they 

2860
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:37,890
just got this clearing

2861
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:40,220
with this little hut.
Man.

2862
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:44,760
That's insane.
That's a view how to live there though.

2863
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:47,100
Like you could do it,
but we.

2864
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:52,190
Everything that we have in our brain 
about what is good in life is attached 

2865
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:55,890
to civilization.
A Nice house in a good neighborhood.

2866
02:04:55,891 --> 02:05:00,240
I want to have cable TV and fast 
internet and a microwave food.

2867
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:02,200
If you.
I can get it immediately.

2868
02:05:02,230 --> 02:05:04,410
Even if you could get food there if like
they knew.

2869
02:05:04,411 --> 02:05:06,390
Like they said they.
They planted bananas.

2870
02:05:06,391 --> 02:05:08,850
They planted all this core and they knew
where the food was.

2871
02:05:08,851 --> 02:05:13,851
There's plenty.
I'm sure there's a ton of living shit 

2872
02:05:13,851 --> 02:05:13,851
out there that you can eat.
Right?

2873
02:05:13,851 --> 02:05:18,140
So even if you can hunt and gather all 
the food you need every single day of 

2874
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:18,300
the week,
would you be happy?

2875
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:23,420
Would never performing standup again?
Would you be happy never watching 

2876
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:26,961
Netflix again.
And would you be happy with no cell 

2877
02:05:26,961 --> 02:05:26,961
phone?

2878
02:05:26,961 --> 02:05:28,440
Would you be happy with no air flights?
Man Live forever.

2879
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,370
Me and my.
My,

2880
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:30,710
my Indian girlfriend.
Yeah.

2881
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:33,030
Who by the way,
it smells like an African prison riot.

2882
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:36,420
How often does that chuck?
Why rains a lot?

2883
02:05:36,421 --> 02:05:39,410
It rains a lot and the rains cleanse the
body.

2884
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:43,100
You fucking.
You smelled centric.

2885
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:47,070
Mother's parcel gland.
It's probably smells like a skunk car.

2886
02:05:47,071 --> 02:05:48,360
Saw Gland.
They'd probably.

2887
02:05:48,361 --> 02:05:50,490
Everyone probably smells like a skunk.
She will.

2888
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:52,380
She probably doesn't bother.
So few of them.

2889
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:57,440
She smokes inside.
Tribes were so small because they 

2890
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:57,660
smelled so bad.
They rarely fucked.

2891
02:05:58,590 --> 02:06:01,890
And then once people figured out soap 
population just exploded.

2892
02:06:01,891 --> 02:06:03,740
Like you smell good enough to fuck.

2893
02:06:06,030 --> 02:06:11,030
Hey,
sanitation played a huge part in 

2894
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:11,030
progress.
I'm serious.

2895
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:14,670
Smelled good enough to be super horny to
fuck one of these people.

2896
02:06:14,671 --> 02:06:16,840
They took pictures from the air.
Yeah.

2897
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:20,010
Yeah,
they have to do that is mind blowing.

2898
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:25,040
I know.
And they probably have this haircut and 

2899
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:25,380
this is a guy working as bow,
but this is um,

2900
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:28,200
I mean he had to have something to shave
his head,

2901
02:06:28,201 --> 02:06:30,330
right.
Body paint.

2902
02:06:30,331 --> 02:06:32,190
Obviously to protect from insects 
probably.

2903
02:06:32,290 --> 02:06:33,090
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.

2904
02:06:33,390 --> 02:06:36,440
But the hall right there,
but the hair,

2905
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:41,560
it appears like he's got a razor.
If you can do that to his hair to look 

2906
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:43,440
at them or some sort of a knife,
you know the shaved.

2907
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:46,110
I cannot believe this.
I'm fascinated by this.

2908
02:06:46,210 --> 02:06:46,930
Oh,
it's incredible.

2909
02:06:46,931 --> 02:06:48,170
We're in the stone age.
Look,

2910
02:06:48,171 --> 02:06:50,340
intense shit.
That's human beings in the raw.

2911
02:06:50,790 --> 02:06:52,950
That's human beings in the raw and we 
haven't had.

2912
02:06:53,130 --> 02:06:58,130
Haven't come into contact with other 
ideas and other cultures and other 

2913
02:06:58,130 --> 02:06:59,520
people.
And so they stayed that way.

2914
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:04,700
Well,
that's the argument against keeping 

2915
02:07:04,700 --> 02:07:08,181
dolphins and whales in captivity that 
these people who in these are absolutely

2916
02:07:08,911 --> 02:07:10,920
100 percent human beings,
right?

2917
02:07:10,921 --> 02:07:13,200
We would give them the same rights that 
you and I both enjoy.

2918
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:17,160
Those people live like they live 
thousands of years ago.

2919
02:07:17,161 --> 02:07:20,900
They have a very crude existence that's 
not very far removed from workers.

2920
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:26,200
So it's not.
The only thing that's different is 

2921
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:26,200
shelter.
They've developed shelter,

2922
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:27,510
which is totally unnecessary for a 
dolphin or a killer whale.

2923
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:29,580
So other than that,
you know,

2924
02:07:29,581 --> 02:07:34,581
with all the things,
all the metrics that we use to describe 

2925
02:07:34,581 --> 02:07:34,581
civilization,
I mean they have some tools,

2926
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:39,620
so tools made out of sticks.
I could teach a boy scout how to make a 

2927
02:07:39,620 --> 02:07:40,300
bow like that.
There are differences.

2928
02:07:40,670 --> 02:07:42,150
Sure.
Their mind yet.

2929
02:07:42,190 --> 02:07:43,580
But to us looking at that.
Yeah,

2930
02:07:44,070 --> 02:07:48,220
I mean you're looking at an incredibly 
primitive form of human life in terms of

2931
02:07:48,221 --> 02:07:53,221
like what we think of as important.
Like how much of a difference is that 

2932
02:07:53,221 --> 02:07:53,990
than orcas?
Well here.

2933
02:07:54,040 --> 02:07:54,790
Killer.
Well yeah.

2934
02:07:54,810 --> 02:07:56,440
You mean you're talking about that exact
example?

2935
02:07:56,441 --> 02:07:58,050
Yeah.
That hasn't come into it.

2936
02:07:58,060 --> 02:07:59,260
Hasn't had the benefit of,
of,

2937
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:01,090
of sort of sharing ideas,
ideas,

2938
02:08:01,091 --> 02:08:03,640
having sex as hunter says.
Yeah,

2939
02:08:03,641 --> 02:08:04,960
you're right.
Crazy.

2940
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:07,660
So it's so amazing that it exists 
though.

2941
02:08:07,661 --> 02:08:09,280
Like I don't know how they could study 
it,

2942
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:10,690
but God,
they have to.

2943
02:08:10,970 --> 02:08:15,970
They have to.
I mean there's gotta be a way to 

2944
02:08:15,970 --> 02:08:18,481
infiltrate in some sort of a way and 
understand they did a lot of that in 

2945
02:08:18,481 --> 02:08:20,170
influencing them pop on Guinea.
They did a lot of that.

2946
02:08:20,190 --> 02:08:21,040
Yeah.
But again,

2947
02:08:21,041 --> 02:08:23,000
with a lot of influence though.
Yes,

2948
02:08:23,001 --> 02:08:23,650
yes,
yes.

2949
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:25,930
There's some horrible shit that came out
of New Guinea.

2950
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:27,460
You,
you know about the new,

2951
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:32,610
the semen warriors I sure do.
And and they did a study on how many of 

2952
02:08:34,241 --> 02:08:36,970
them actually become gay later on.
It's only about five percent.

2953
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:39,040
It has nothing to do with it.
It's really interesting.

2954
02:08:39,041 --> 02:08:44,041
But the boys to reach puberty have to 
suck the sperm out of the men in the 

2955
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:49,981
tribe.
They have to suck them off and take it 

2956
02:08:49,981 --> 02:08:52,291
in their ass.
Usually it's sucking for about two 

2957
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:52,291
years,
two,

2958
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:53,890
three years until they reach puberty.
Said,

2959
02:08:53,950 --> 02:08:55,870
yeah,
you can ingest a lot of Dick.

2960
02:08:55,880 --> 02:09:00,880
Suck a lot of debt.
I think you have to do that to get 

2961
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:00,880
bigger.
Yeah.

2962
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,190
You got to do that to become a man.
Someone should just have the rock flying

2963
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:03,070
there.
Look at me.

2964
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:05,100
Boys never sucked a dick once.
Yeah.

2965
02:09:05,210 --> 02:09:07,030
And then that was the whole thing would 
stop.

2966
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:11,240
That is how it would stop that.
That's exactly how you'd be like,

2967
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:12,960
wait a minute.
Those fucking guys are really strong and

2968
02:09:12,961 --> 02:09:17,961
they never talked.
They must ingest the semen of their 

2969
02:09:17,961 --> 02:09:20,310
elders daily from the age of seven until
he turned 17 to achieve adult male 

2970
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:25,081
status.
It's not true to properly mature and 

2971
02:09:25,081 --> 02:09:27,511
grow strong.
I read that it was a little older than 

2972
02:09:27,511 --> 02:09:27,511
seven.
Actually.

2973
02:09:27,511 --> 02:09:27,511
That's not,
that's not altogether true.

2974
02:09:27,511 --> 02:09:30,790
So they'll sure on wikipedia.
What the fuck do you know?

2975
02:09:30,820 --> 02:09:33,790
I think that they may be because in the 
book a billion wicked thoughts.

2976
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:35,020
I think they start when they're,
uh,

2977
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:40,140
they're gonna reach puberty,
like did like 13 when they started to 

2978
02:09:40,140 --> 02:09:41,020
show signs and then it helps you get 
into.

2979
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:42,550
Because I had read that same thing 
though,

2980
02:09:42,551 --> 02:09:44,460
that it was younger.
It was seven.

2981
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:45,460
I'm not going to suck.
That guy's.

2982
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:46,530
That guy's cock.

2983
02:09:46,570 --> 02:09:49,210
Smells good.
Look at him.

2984
02:09:49,690 --> 02:09:50,470
Great.
Look though.

2985
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:51,910
They'll get them great.
Look.

2986
02:09:51,911 --> 02:09:56,911
Wow.
That is a crazy look from a guy who you 

2987
02:09:56,911 --> 02:09:56,911
have to blow.
I mean,

2988
02:09:56,911 --> 02:09:58,000
look at how human beings,
they decorate themselves.

2989
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:59,970
It's going to suck my cock.
What's hanging?

2990
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:05,630
You have to suck a grown man's Dick.
It's another thing if he's dressed up 

2991
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:06,310
like pokemon,
like what is that paint that he's got on

2992
02:10:06,311 --> 02:10:08,830
his face swell up so I can see the lungs
and American horror story.

2993
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:11,170
Look at the pain on his face.
Like what kind of.

2994
02:10:11,171 --> 02:10:16,171
He's got this crazy white nose and 
bright yellow paint all over his face 

2995
02:10:16,171 --> 02:10:16,870
with red stripes.
Yeah.

2996
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,730
And.
And he's putting in your mouth.

2997
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:20,160
Yeah.
That's a hell of a fro.

2998
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:24,220
It's hard to get over.
Like that's gonna stick with you.

2999
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:25,960
Those images are gonna.
Stick with you.

3000
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:29,560
Average lifespan in Papa New Guinea for 
a lot of those tribes is 45 by the way,

3001
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:30,850
because they're sucking dicks all the 
time.

3002
02:10:30,851 --> 02:10:34,100
That can't be good for eating roots and 
food and they're getting

3003
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,930
infections.
You're not.

3004
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:37,820
Oh they.
The big myth about,

3005
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:39,260
you know,
and you're in the jungle there.

3006
02:10:39,261 --> 02:10:41,190
You can assimilate and you live at.
No,

3007
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:42,830
no shit.
Happens.

3008
02:10:42,831 --> 02:10:45,020
Like you get a cut,
it gets infected.

3009
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:49,400
It's immediately.
And homicide is huge.

3010
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:52,100
Homicides,
I think the leading cause of death among

3011
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:57,120
hunter gatherer tribes in Papa New 
Guinea because they just get into these 

3012
02:10:57,120 --> 02:10:58,850
fights with the agenda because when to 
get back the dude that made you suck his

3013
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:00,390
dick when you were seven.
No,

3014
02:11:00,410 --> 02:11:01,520
he's in your tribe,
sir.

3015
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:06,580
That's just part of it because you're 
getting your dick suck now you have to 

3016
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:09,101
understand part of the problem.
It's just passed down generation to 

3017
02:11:09,101 --> 02:11:11,090
generation molestation.
Correct.

3018
02:11:11,150 --> 02:11:14,390
That's what's really crazy.
It's almost like child molestation built

3019
02:11:14,391 --> 02:11:16,160
into the operating system with their 
culture.

3020
02:11:16,310 --> 02:11:18,470
Some pedophile said,
you know what guys?

3021
02:11:18,471 --> 02:11:19,180
I have,
you know,

3022
02:11:19,210 --> 02:11:20,240
I saw a vision.

3023
02:11:20,510 --> 02:11:23,000
You think that's one person,
but here's the thing.

3024
02:11:23,030 --> 02:11:25,190
Here's the real question.
Like throughout history,

3025
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:30,280
I mean like literally from the beginning
of time people have been molesting young

3026
02:11:30,321 --> 02:11:35,321
boys,
like grown men would take young boys 

3027
02:11:35,321 --> 02:11:35,940
places and the last time logs.
It's socrates,

3028
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:37,200
it's in the.
It's in the dialogue.

3029
02:11:37,210 --> 02:11:38,450
So the symposium.
Yeah.

3030
02:11:38,451 --> 02:11:41,120
How nuts is that when you,
whenever you consider socrates,

3031
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:43,130
one of the things you have to consider 
as a PSA.

3032
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:48,160
Socrates was a pedophile.
He apparently was married and didn't 

3033
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:51,911
partake,
but certainly aristotle and Plato and 

3034
02:11:51,911 --> 02:11:55,301
his students identities didn't and and 
his and his contemporaries would talk 

3035
02:11:55,301 --> 02:11:57,440
about how we have nice boys.
Let's go back and drink some wine.

3036
02:11:57,890 --> 02:12:02,890
We'll go,
we'll go eat and kiss some beautiful 

3037
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:02,890
boys and then we'll talk some more.
Yeah,

3038
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:06,020
Jesus Christ.
Trust him.

3039
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:08,120
He was never.
He was always.

3040
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:13,340
He famously said,
as philosophers should treat their 

3041
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:13,360
appetites,
their body with a quiet contempt.

3042
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Learn to let go of your body as you get 
older and not not hold onto it because 

3043
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,450
you're gonna have to let go of it.
So who's the opposite of the dude in the

3044
02:12:20,451 --> 02:12:24,590
yacht with a ringing years and the big 
fat really well and so much so that when

3045
02:12:24,591 --> 02:12:27,440
he got poisoned by the hemlock and his 
students were crying,

3046
02:12:27,710 --> 02:12:28,520
he said,
you guys,

3047
02:12:28,521 --> 02:12:31,220
what are you crying for it?
You're crying over my shell.

3048
02:12:31,610 --> 02:12:36,610
I'm going onto something bigger and 
you're crying about this broken down 

3049
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:36,860
machinery that's going to break down 
anyway.

3050
02:12:36,861 --> 02:12:39,290
If I taught you nothing,
why did he get poisoned again?

3051
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:44,510
Because he wouldn't essentially,
he would not stop talking.

3052
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:47,720
He was considered to be a heretic in a 
way he was,

3053
02:12:47,721 --> 02:12:51,260
he was speaking against Athens,
a bet against the elite,

3054
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:52,850
against,
um,

3055
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:56,060
against the gods.
And he was a man of reason,

3056
02:12:56,330 --> 02:12:58,400
not so much faith but rather reason.

3057
02:12:58,730 --> 02:13:03,730
And so he was somebody who was 
considered to be a threat to the power 

3058
02:13:03,981 --> 02:13:06,230
structure,
a threat to the religion threat to,

3059
02:13:06,231 --> 02:13:06,650
and,
you know,

3060
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:11,430
and so socrates was considered a,
essentially an enemy of the state.

3061
02:13:11,490 --> 02:13:13,340
He had an opportunity,
they don't want to kill him.

3062
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:15,560
The Greek government said,
get,

3063
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:16,400
you know,
listen,

3064
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:17,810
Hey,
we're condemned to death.

3065
02:13:17,870 --> 02:13:18,650
Uh,
I eat,

3066
02:13:18,651 --> 02:13:20,510
we're looking the other way.
Get the fuck out of town.

3067
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:22,910
Just be an exile.
And Socrates said,

3068
02:13:22,911 --> 02:13:24,620
no,
sorry,

3069
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:29,270
because that would be admitting fault if
you guys want to sin against philosophy,

3070
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:32,610
kill me,
but I'm not going to what I said and I'm

3071
02:13:32,611 --> 02:13:37,611
not going to say sorry and I'm not going
to leave because I've lived under these 

3072
02:13:37,611 --> 02:13:40,080
rules and these laws forever.
And if that's the law of the land that I

3073
02:13:40,081 --> 02:13:42,810
will take my punishment,
but you guys are wrong,

3074
02:13:42,811 --> 02:13:44,070
but just know this is on you.

3075
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,840
Not on me was very powerful,
you know,

3076
02:13:46,841 --> 02:13:48,740
there's the apology and there's the,
the,

3077
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:50,790
the you should.
Everybody should read it.

3078
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:52,380
It's fascinating.
Totally different story.

3079
02:13:52,381 --> 02:13:55,080
If you talked to them a creepy voice,
that wouldn't be.

3080
02:13:55,310 --> 02:13:58,170
It should read it.
And if you want to come and tell you how

3081
02:13:58,171 --> 02:14:03,171
he said it said Non Fault of 11,
of 11 under Greg Love Lover Time.

3082
02:14:04,770 --> 02:14:07,350
Have you ever contemplated like what it 
would be like?

3083
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:12,530
I mean I,
I assume that this is going to be 

3084
02:14:12,530 --> 02:14:13,480
available and some sort of a simulated 
form in virtual reality within you know,

3085
02:14:13,650 --> 02:14:18,650
our lives to be able to go and 
experience what it would be like to be 

3086
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:24,080
inside of a building and watching people
live as if people lived like in that 

3087
02:14:26,431 --> 02:14:31,431
rain forest or watching people live as 
people lived in ancient Greece or 

3088
02:14:31,431 --> 02:14:35,721
ancient Rome and just trying to 
experience what it would be like in our 

3089
02:14:35,721 --> 02:14:36,120
minds.

3090
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:37,440
This is normal life,
right?

3091
02:14:37,441 --> 02:14:39,780
This is normal life being in a building,
electricity,

3092
02:14:39,781 --> 02:14:44,781
all that set.
I think it would be so fucking 

3093
02:14:44,781 --> 02:14:48,420
enlightening if we could just for a 
brief moment,

3094
02:14:48,421 --> 02:14:53,421
even even if just for a few minutes it 
try to experience what life was like 

3095
02:14:53,421 --> 02:14:55,710
back then and then try to put it into 
context.

3096
02:14:56,010 --> 02:15:01,010
Well,
I think the big factor would be that 

3097
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:01,010
there was so much we didn't know.
For example,

3098
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:02,080
germ theory,
uh,

3099
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:07,340
forget about medical stuff.
Just like when I'm talking about like 

3100
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:10,230
the way people look at the world.
Like if you listen to Lenny Bruce today,

3101
02:15:10,650 --> 02:15:15,650
it's hard to listen to Lenny Bruce today
because you already know a lot of the 

3102
02:15:15,650 --> 02:15:15,650
things he's saying and it's not really 
so groundbreaking anymore.

3103
02:15:15,650 --> 02:15:18,360
But if you listen to it in 1959 
nightclub,

3104
02:15:18,361 --> 02:15:19,950
you'd be like,
Holy Shit,

3105
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:25,250
this is blowing my mind.
I imagined being in front of socrates,

3106
02:15:25,730 --> 02:15:30,730
imagine them being around all these 
people that had so little access to 

3107
02:15:32,281 --> 02:15:36,480
knowledge knew so little about how the 
world actually worked or did there.

3108
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:37,120
I Dunno.
So,

3109
02:15:37,121 --> 02:15:39,270
so sure they did.
In comparison to what we know today.

3110
02:15:39,540 --> 02:15:40,440
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

3111
02:15:40,441 --> 02:15:40,830
But,
but,

3112
02:15:40,831 --> 02:15:45,831
but okay.
I'm actually a saying in the context of 

3113
02:15:45,831 --> 02:15:46,320
the civilization that existed at the 
time,

3114
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:48,440
what kind of a weird world would that 
be?

3115
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:50,700
I think the fundamental difference would
be you'd be much.

3116
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:53,670
You'd have a much closer and intimate 
relationship with life and death.

3117
02:15:53,671 --> 02:15:54,300
Right?
Right.

3118
02:15:54,370 --> 02:15:55,950
Because it was always,
yeah,

3119
02:15:55,951 --> 02:16:00,951
all the time and you were going to die,
probably have to hide and so you died of

3120
02:16:01,741 --> 02:16:04,740
disease that would roll through and the 
plague would come and then it would be a

3121
02:16:04,741 --> 02:16:09,741
war and all this stuff would happen.
So I think you'd have a more intimate 

3122
02:16:09,741 --> 02:16:13,551
relationship with death,
but I think actually that when you say 

3123
02:16:13,551 --> 02:16:14,610
we do have access to more information,
we know more.

3124
02:16:14,910 --> 02:16:19,910
Okay.
A as in we know more about the 

3125
02:16:19,910 --> 02:16:20,580
methodology of like sort of how certain 
things work.

3126
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:22,980
We know that there's a shark that list 
500 years.

3127
02:16:22,981 --> 02:16:27,981
I mean,
I don't know if thinking people back 

3128
02:16:27,981 --> 02:16:32,451
then less in terms of what it was to be 
essentially human and the responsibility

3129
02:16:36,071 --> 02:16:37,600
of a human being.
So in other words,

3130
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:40,150
if you really get down to brass tax,
at the end of the day,

3131
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:45,330
you're left with yourself,
you're left with the things you can 

3132
02:16:45,330 --> 02:16:48,451
conquer within yourself.
You're left with the things you can put 

3133
02:16:48,451 --> 02:16:50,470
into context about yourself.
You're left with how much self knowledge

3134
02:16:50,471 --> 02:16:53,740
at the end of the day when you die,
how well did you get to know yourself?

3135
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:59,040
One of the big values of putting 
yourself in in risky situations or 

3136
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:01,780
putting yourself into situations where 
need to learn something that takes a lot

3137
02:17:01,781 --> 02:17:06,781
out of you as you learn about yourself.
And I think the Greeks knew that and 

3138
02:17:06,781 --> 02:17:08,080
wrote about that as well as anybody 
ever.

3139
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:11,440
And I think that they understood like 
you read Seneca,

3140
02:17:11,441 --> 02:17:16,441
you read socrates and no,
they didn't have the technological 

3141
02:17:16,441 --> 02:17:19,320
advantages we did,
but they didn't have the ability to get 

3142
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:19,320
as close to the rest of the world as we 
did.

3143
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:24,120
They had deep,
deep concepts and wrestled with the big 

3144
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:27,040
ideas and questions that have never left
us,

3145
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:32,280
that still haunt us.
The idea of what is the difference 

3146
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:33,340
between good and evil?
How should I really live my life?

3147
02:17:33,610 --> 02:17:38,610
What is the right thing to do and 
everybody's telling me to do this and 

3148
02:17:38,610 --> 02:17:39,730
it's way more convenient,
but what's the answer?

3149
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:44,880
Am I really just my appetites or on my 
more than that and if my dignity and my 

3150
02:17:45,890 --> 02:17:50,890
morality and ethics are compromised,
what I have the courage to stand there 

3151
02:17:51,611 --> 02:17:53,950
and say I'm going to stay in Greece and 
not leave.

3152
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:59,220
Those big human questions are as 
relevant today as they were then and if 

3153
02:17:59,321 --> 02:18:02,380
you really get down to what it's what it
means to be a human being and if you get

3154
02:18:02,381 --> 02:18:05,650
down to knowledge,
maybe they may be.

3155
02:18:05,651 --> 02:18:06,790
We don't know more than them.

3156
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:09,970
Well first of all,
there's a huge problem with the word we.

3157
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:12,040
Okay,
because like who you talking about?

3158
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:17,280
Are you talking about me?
Are you talking about the greater human 

3159
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:17,280
knowledge?
Well,

3160
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:17,770
for sure the greater human knowledge is 
far,

3161
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:20,140
far vast,
far more vast,

3162
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:23,020
far more in depth.
We know more about science.

3163
02:18:23,021 --> 02:18:28,021
We know more about cells and the 
universe and the ocean and everything 

3164
02:18:28,021 --> 02:18:30,910
there is to be observed as far as 
applied knowledge,

3165
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:33,550
like are we living in a wise way?
Well,

3166
02:18:33,551 --> 02:18:34,920
we don't really know.
I mean we,

3167
02:18:34,921 --> 02:18:39,921
we,
we don't know in comparison to how they 

3168
02:18:39,921 --> 02:18:40,930
live then because we know we have tails 
that were written down and passed.

3169
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:46,260
Generation after generation are honest 
understanding of the day to day 

3170
02:18:46,571 --> 02:18:49,840
existence in terms of what it would be 
like to actually be there.

3171
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:51,760
It's very limited.
It's very.

3172
02:18:51,761 --> 02:18:55,810
It's also very speculative.
There's a lot of like putting the pieces

3173
02:18:55,811 --> 02:19:00,811
together and you know,
that's one of the things that history 

3174
02:19:00,811 --> 02:19:00,811
professors will do when they're teaching
a class.

3175
02:19:00,811 --> 02:19:05,161
They'll paint a picture of what they 
believe it was like back then based on 

3176
02:19:05,161 --> 02:19:07,810
the facts that they,
they can definitely cling to.

3177
02:19:08,290 --> 02:19:11,570
But as far as experiencing it,
what was it actually like?

3178
02:19:11,590 --> 02:19:13,000
Yeah.
Well I had a really great.

3179
02:19:13,001 --> 02:19:14,470
There's a great professor

3180
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:19,980
who,
who teaches this class and the turning 

3181
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:19,980
points in European history,
which you can get that teaching company.

3182
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:22,090
He said something really awesome.
He starts to lecture with this.

3183
02:19:22,091 --> 02:19:24,070
He said,
I want you guys,

3184
02:19:24,071 --> 02:19:29,071
it was the fall of Constantinople,
a city that stood for a thousand years 

3185
02:19:29,071 --> 02:19:33,701
and walls stood for a thousand years,
and when the Turks came in with this 

3186
02:19:33,780 --> 02:19:37,760
hundred foot gun and started blasting 
the walls,

3187
02:19:38,090 --> 02:19:43,090
Jesus Christ,
and then they sold most of the killed a 

3188
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:45,611
sack,
the city raped and killed most of the 

3189
02:19:45,611 --> 02:19:46,730
men and then sold about 150,000
and the slavery,

3190
02:19:46,731 --> 02:19:51,731
which means they chained them up and 
marched him back to one of their 

3191
02:19:51,731 --> 02:19:52,670
colonies and sold them on an open 
market.

3192
02:19:52,671 --> 02:19:53,850
And he said,
and he said,

3193
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:58,880
remember,
this is a city that had stood for a 

3194
02:19:58,880 --> 02:19:59,330
hundred years.
It was when that then became Istanbul,

3195
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:02,330
became the center of the Ottoman Empire.
And he said,

3196
02:20:02,331 --> 02:20:07,331
I want you to think for a second about 
what it sounded like to be inside that 

3197
02:20:07,761 --> 02:20:09,500
city are on that wall.

3198
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:14,920
When it was coming down,
when you knew that walls that it stood 

3199
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:18,581
for a thousand years.
We're finally giving way to this new 

3200
02:20:18,581 --> 02:20:21,191
technology,
which was a giant cannon that it took 

3201
02:20:21,191 --> 02:20:21,890
them a,
a mile a day to drag,

3202
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:26,920
you know,
and they did it for 100 miles or 

3203
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:28,571
something crazy.
So I want you to think these Ottomans 

3204
02:20:28,571 --> 02:20:31,511
are outside these,
these dudes are going to take no mercy 

3205
02:20:31,511 --> 02:20:34,930
and they are going to,
they're going to do what they want when 

3206
02:20:34,930 --> 02:20:35,600
and I want you to,
what did it smell like?

3207
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:40,900
What when they get,
what did it sound like and what was 

3208
02:20:40,900 --> 02:20:44,621
really going on as you were waiting in 
your house and they and they came 

3209
02:20:44,621 --> 02:20:47,150
through the walls and for the first time
in a thousand years,

3210
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:51,470
your city and everything you knew was 
going to be burned,

3211
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:53,300
raped,
killed,

3212
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:56,120
sold into slavery,
and changed.

3213
02:20:56,870 --> 02:20:58,490
Think about that shit for a second.

3214
02:20:58,490 --> 02:21:03,490
And that was a reality for people.
And that's a fascinating way to teach 

3215
02:21:03,490 --> 02:21:05,240
history because it brings it down to a 
visceral level when you go.

3216
02:21:05,241 --> 02:21:10,241
These motherfuckers lived through that.
So I think that the existential 

3217
02:21:10,241 --> 02:21:12,110
possibility that you and everybody,
you know,

3218
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:15,350
like almost oz,
the Israeli writers,

3219
02:21:15,351 --> 02:21:20,351
his mother killed herself and he said,
my mother killed herself because in 

3220
02:21:20,351 --> 02:21:20,770
Ukraine,
in when,

3221
02:21:20,771 --> 02:21:24,830
when she was from Kiev,
I think in one day 25,000

3222
02:21:24,831 --> 02:21:28,160
Jews were killed by the Nazis.
And one day he said in her town,

3223
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:32,480
everybody she knew and everybody that 
knew those people and everything,

3224
02:21:32,481 --> 02:21:36,920
she came from for generation seven 
generations wiped away,

3225
02:21:37,250 --> 02:21:42,250
all killed.
And now she's in Sun Baked Jerusalem or 

3226
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,540
Haifa,
wherever it is.

3227
02:21:44,690 --> 02:21:47,510
Think about what that was like for a 
human being where everything,

3228
02:21:47,511 --> 02:21:48,210
you know,
being like,

3229
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:49,700
same thing,
like being a native American,

3230
02:21:50,030 --> 02:21:52,400
everything needed,
all the buffaloes killed their bodies.

3231
02:21:52,530 --> 02:21:56,240
The hides laced restrict nine.
All the animals that are eating that are

3232
02:21:56,241 --> 02:21:58,580
dying.
So all your entire mythology,

3233
02:21:58,581 --> 02:22:03,581
Joseph Campbell talks about that all 
your whole mythology has been wiped 

3234
02:22:03,581 --> 02:22:07,031
away.
The buffalo that is the centerpiece of 

3235
02:22:07,031 --> 02:22:08,480
your mythology or God and all the Egos 
and everything else in your God.

3236
02:22:08,481 --> 02:22:12,800
Obviously he's not strong enough to stop
this incredibly strong western God.

3237
02:22:12,890 --> 02:22:16,340
What does that say about not only your 
very existence but the gods?

3238
02:22:16,341 --> 02:22:18,740
You've been sacrificing and covering a 
lot of territory here?

3239
02:22:18,741 --> 02:22:23,741
Brian callen.
You just went through three entire 

3240
02:22:23,741 --> 02:22:25,400
distance creditors be a distraction.
What it's like to be an ancient person,

3241
02:22:25,470 --> 02:22:25,920
not good.

3242
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:31,040
The fact that you could lose everything,
do you have what my was going to get to 

3243
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:33,621
something,
but my point was imagine that there's 

3244
02:22:33,621 --> 02:22:34,770
going to be a civilization one day that 
looks back on the primitive nature of us

3245
02:22:34,771 --> 02:22:39,771
today with the same sort of like bizarre
reflection that we look back at 

3246
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:45,560
socrates,
so we look back on the people that were 

3247
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:45,560
on the mayflower.
The.

3248
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:49,640
It's just hard to imagine as we're all 
trying to expand our consciousness and 

3249
02:22:50,191 --> 02:22:55,191
grow as a civilization and we would hope
that with every new president we have 

3250
02:22:55,191 --> 02:22:59,811
like a a better way of doing things and 
our government tightens up and our laws 

3251
02:22:59,811 --> 02:23:00,150
get better.
That's one of the things that people are

3252
02:23:00,151 --> 02:23:05,151
so terrified about with this new 
administration that if everyone feels 

3253
02:23:05,151 --> 02:23:06,500
like it's slipping backwards,
but one day you know,

3254
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:11,660
the give and take the flow,
the ebb and flow of information in 500 

3255
02:23:11,660 --> 02:23:11,660
years from now when they look back the 
way we look at,

3256
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:12,600
you know,
the,

3257
02:23:12,601 --> 02:23:14,160
um,
the,

3258
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:19,400
the attack of the Mongols on Gin,
China or Baghdad and any of these 

3259
02:23:20,620 --> 02:23:25,620
places,
you look back at the destruction that 

3260
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:28,161
took place just a few hundred years ago 
and the kind of civilization that 

3261
02:23:28,161 --> 02:23:31,131
existed back then and what would it be 
like to be in the felt tense of the 

3262
02:23:31,131 --> 02:23:35,361
Mongols as they were camped outside of 
the gates of the city that they were 

3263
02:23:35,361 --> 02:23:35,361
going to hurl.

3264
02:23:35,361 --> 02:23:37,410
Flaming bodies with catapults at would 
sit there,

3265
02:23:37,411 --> 02:23:39,510
room's on fire with flaming human 
beings.

3266
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:42,480
The fat,
the fat burns really good,

3267
02:23:42,481 --> 02:23:45,390
so they would light people on fire,
doused him and kerosene,

3268
02:23:45,391 --> 02:23:47,610
light them on fire,
and then launch them through the fucking

3269
02:23:47,611 --> 02:23:50,520
air and they would land on buildings and
light them on fire from the outside.

3270
02:23:50,550 --> 02:23:51,390
Well,
let me ask you this,

3271
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:53,830
so let's jump ahead to 100 years or 
whatever.

3272
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:58,910
So you can live,
you can live 100 years longer than you 

3273
02:23:58,910 --> 02:24:01,041
are now.
So fucking that robot that looks creep 

3274
02:24:01,041 --> 02:24:01,430
when 100 percent.
I am 100 percent.

3275
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:04,670
I have fat guy with the white belly on 
the uh,

3276
02:24:04,770 --> 02:24:06,860
now you want my ears and you won't,
you won't,

3277
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:11,900
you won't have to do because I have 
drugs and you'll be all estate shredded 

3278
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:11,900
right now.
You'll be a teenager,

3279
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:15,831
the equivalent of a teenager.
What would you do with another 100 

3280
02:24:15,831 --> 02:24:15,831
years?

3281
02:24:15,831 --> 02:24:16,860
Try to get better at life.
What do you mean?

3282
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:22,290
Try to get better at my management of 
life might be the entire experience.

3283
02:24:22,291 --> 02:24:24,540
Like what,
how much of it is positive?

3284
02:24:24,570 --> 02:24:28,290
Not just positive for me but positive 
for other people that I interact with.

3285
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:29,690
How much of it,
uh,

3286
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:34,760
how,
how much better have I gotten at a 

3287
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:34,760
standup,
at podcasting,

3288
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:37,260
at creating things that,
writing things at expressing myself,

3289
02:24:37,890 --> 02:24:38,850
you know,
all those things,

3290
02:24:38,851 --> 02:24:41,520
all the things that I'm doing now.
If I had to live five more years,

3291
02:24:41,521 --> 02:24:43,860
what would I do in five more years to 
try to get better at what I'm doing?

3292
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:46,050
If I had 95 more years.
Other than that,

3293
02:24:46,051 --> 02:24:51,051
well,
I'll definitely get better if my body 

3294
02:24:51,051 --> 02:24:51,051
works.
I'd like to keep doing Jujitsu.

3295
02:24:51,051 --> 02:24:52,410
I'd like to keep doing martial arts.
I like to keep working out.

3296
02:24:52,411 --> 02:24:53,730
I like Yoga.
It's fun.

3297
02:24:53,730 --> 02:24:55,920
It feels good.
You do it how you do it a lot.

3298
02:24:56,010 --> 02:24:57,540
Yeah,
I'm doing it three times a week now.

3299
02:24:57,840 --> 02:24:58,640
God,
yeah man.

3300
02:24:58,641 --> 02:25:01,470
It's um,
I think more things you do,

3301
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:06,770
the better you get at doing things and I
think the better you get at doing 

3302
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:07,650
things,
the more of an understanding you have of

3303
02:25:07,651 --> 02:25:09,420
yourself and if you're being totally 
honest,

3304
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:11,310
the more of an understanding you have of
yourself,

3305
02:25:11,311 --> 02:25:16,311
the better you are at managing life.
So I just try to get better at managing 

3306
02:25:16,311 --> 02:25:18,420
life I can.
And so defining life at managing life as

3307
02:25:18,421 --> 02:25:21,600
in knowing where to place your energy,
knowing where to place your energy.

3308
02:25:21,601 --> 02:25:23,800
For sure.
I'm knowing,

3309
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:24,940
um,
what,

3310
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:28,300
what something actually means versus how
it makes you feel.

3311
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:31,930
Um,
knowing why things make you feel certain

3312
02:25:31,931 --> 02:25:36,931
way while you can,
they could feel totally different in a 

3313
02:25:36,931 --> 02:25:36,931
different day,
a different circumstance,

3314
02:25:36,931 --> 02:25:39,460
like how,
how are you going into things neutral or

3315
02:25:39,470 --> 02:25:42,820
you going to things loaded up already 
with emotions and with negativity.

3316
02:25:42,821 --> 02:25:47,821
And then you immediately react from this
loaded up position instead of from a 

3317
02:25:47,821 --> 02:25:52,621
neutral position where you can analyze 
it and decided that nothing truly has 

3318
02:25:52,621 --> 02:25:53,440
any meaning other than the meeting that 
you give it.

3319
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:58,590
That's the,
that's the book thinking fast and slow 

3320
02:25:58,590 --> 02:25:58,590
by Daniel Economy.
Yeah.

3321
02:25:58,590 --> 02:25:58,590
About,
about.

3322
02:25:58,590 --> 02:26:00,440
He won a Nobel Prize in economics.
Really?

3323
02:26:00,470 --> 02:26:02,300
Yeah.
And he talks about that.

3324
02:26:02,330 --> 02:26:03,650
He did all those experiments,
right?

3325
02:26:03,651 --> 02:26:04,640
So,
uh,

3326
02:26:04,670 --> 02:26:08,150
just about getting to know how your 
body,

3327
02:26:08,151 --> 02:26:12,160
how your fast thinking brain reacts and 
learning that,

3328
02:26:12,250 --> 02:26:16,730
that sort of getting a handle on your 
mechanisms and how even the way you hold

3329
02:26:16,731 --> 02:26:18,770
your body.
So if you're smiling,

3330
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:20,750
you're going to think something's 
actually funnier.

3331
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:25,960
And then if you're frowning,
they had people hold a pencil in their 

3332
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:26,630
teeth sideways.
I saw joke.

3333
02:26:26,631 --> 02:26:28,690
They thought it was funnier than if they
were holding a pencil,

3334
02:26:28,691 --> 02:26:30,370
a deuce with the point.
Oh,

3335
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:32,870
they were in a frown.
They thought it wasn't as funny.

3336
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:38,380
Right,
so or when they were told that take a 

3337
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:40,751
test and make come up with sentences out
of the words gray and wrinkled and 

3338
02:26:40,751 --> 02:26:44,951
sunshine and bald.
They moved to the next test slower 

3339
02:26:44,951 --> 02:26:49,630
because those words made them think of 
old people and so how the language you 

3340
02:26:50,811 --> 02:26:52,880
use,
how you hold your body,

3341
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:58,180
all those things affect how you are 
going to interact with data and stimulus

3342
02:26:58,731 --> 02:27:02,570
that you're presented with.
So the state that you are in is going to

3343
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:05,900
influence how you react to something.

3344
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:07,610
I think we all are aware of that though,
right?

3345
02:27:07,611 --> 02:27:08,620
You're aware of that?
Yeah.

3346
02:27:08,630 --> 02:27:10,500
Like sometimes you're not about myself 
up,

3347
02:27:10,850 --> 02:27:13,430
you're ramped up.
You don't want to be exposed to bad news

3348
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:15,290
because then you'd be like,
what the fuck?

3349
02:27:15,630 --> 02:27:16,700
No,
just compound.

3350
02:27:16,701 --> 02:27:21,701
And we all know people who are always 
ramped up and they're always having bad 

3351
02:27:21,701 --> 02:27:22,670
things happen to them and it could be 
connected.

3352
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:24,030
Yeah,
don't do.

3353
02:27:24,070 --> 02:27:29,070
Do you ever find that you like it really
like I have to guard myself against 

3354
02:27:29,070 --> 02:27:30,460
negative shit because it'll distract me 
from my work?

3355
02:27:30,740 --> 02:27:31,370
Oh,
for sure.

3356
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:32,120
Right.
Well,

3357
02:27:32,150 --> 02:27:37,150
I mean what if you wanted to,
you could fill your head up everyday 

3358
02:27:37,150 --> 02:27:41,050
with horror stories that helpful,
not helpful and and also unmanageable.

3359
02:27:41,570 --> 02:27:44,360
Like again,
we're talking about the 7 billion people

3360
02:27:44,361 --> 02:27:45,860
in the world that you're getting news 
from.

3361
02:27:45,890 --> 02:27:50,890
You're getting all the events that 
happen to 7 billion people and only the 

3362
02:27:50,890 --> 02:27:52,550
extraordinary ones that fucked up ones 
are the ones that are interesting.

3363
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:54,770
The guy who takes that truck and runs it
through the crowd,

3364
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:59,980
those are the ones that are interesting.
Forget about all the people handing out 

3365
02:27:59,980 --> 02:28:02,471
flowers and inviting people in their 
homes for t all those things that are 

3366
02:28:02,471 --> 02:28:03,200
taking place at the same time,
don't attract our attention.

3367
02:28:03,230 --> 02:28:05,210
That's interesting.
So it does become a real problem.

3368
02:28:05,211 --> 02:28:08,510
If you want to look at the experiences 
of 7 billion people,

3369
02:28:08,690 --> 02:28:13,690
you can find a lot of horrific shit,
but if you want to look at the 

3370
02:28:13,690 --> 02:28:13,690
experience of one person,
you,

3371
02:28:13,690 --> 02:28:18,311
Brian Callen,
your interactions are almost entirely 

3372
02:28:18,311 --> 02:28:18,311
positive.

3373
02:28:18,311 --> 02:28:21,050
Know your day is almost entirely filled 
with laughter and friendship and fun and

3374
02:28:21,470 --> 02:28:26,470
around and getting on stage and 
performing and doing podcasts and time 

3375
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:30,400
with your family and having a wonderful 
time so you can.

3376
02:28:30,580 --> 02:28:35,580
You can have a distorted view of the 
world by being too aware of the whole 

3377
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:37,040
world and then people will tell you,
well,

3378
02:28:37,041 --> 02:28:42,041
hey man,
you can't live your life in a fucking 

3379
02:28:42,041 --> 02:28:42,041
bubble,
man.

3380
02:28:42,041 --> 02:28:42,041
No,
that's called life.

3381
02:28:42,050 --> 02:28:44,120
Everybody lives in a bubble.
You can't like.

3382
02:28:44,190 --> 02:28:47,900
That's why Maryland can go on TV and say
that mixed martial arts isn't art.

3383
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:50,900
Like why is she saying that?
Because that's her bubble in her bubble.

3384
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:55,960
That makes sense.
She could say that if she said that if 

3385
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:56,090
we were all backstage at the UFC and she
said that people would be like,

3386
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:58,040
fuck what?
Right?

3387
02:28:58,070 --> 02:28:59,270
What the fuck did she just say?

3388
02:28:59,430 --> 02:29:00,860
That is so rude.
Why would you say that?

3389
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:04,360
Why would you come here where people 
love and worship this and say that?

3390
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:08,430
Why would you come here when people find
the importance in this sport,

3391
02:29:08,450 --> 02:29:10,400
in this art form,
and why would you disagree and why would

3392
02:29:10,401 --> 02:29:11,890
you downplay it that way?
Sure.

3393
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:13,490
Well,
he did because she's in her bubble.

3394
02:29:13,491 --> 02:29:18,491
Everybody's in a fucking bubble course.
There's no way you could be good at 

3395
02:29:18,491 --> 02:29:18,491
anything you'd have.
You have to create a bubble.

3396
02:29:18,491 --> 02:29:22,520
I would argue like because if I want to 
write standup and I'm walking down and I

3397
02:29:22,521 --> 02:29:27,521
started thinking about the drug cartels 
in Mexico and how they kill innocent 

3398
02:29:27,521 --> 02:29:28,040
people or whatever it might be,
I'm going to get ramped up and I'm going

3399
02:29:28,041 --> 02:29:29,480
to go,
what would I do in that situation?

3400
02:29:29,481 --> 02:29:34,481
I'm going to get full of fear and I'm 
not going to be thinking about what I 

3401
02:29:34,481 --> 02:29:34,481
got to thinking about,
which is,

3402
02:29:34,481 --> 02:29:34,481
you know,
whatever it might be.

3403
02:29:34,481 --> 02:29:38,740
Or maybe I can use that in my stuff,
but I find I have to really guard 

3404
02:29:38,740 --> 02:29:42,390
against unhelpful think you should.
Yeah.

3405
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:47,440
You know,
and that's one of the reasons why I 

3406
02:29:47,440 --> 02:29:49,211
refuse to go down all these God damn 
conspiracy holes that everybody wants 

3407
02:29:49,211 --> 02:29:50,870
you to go down and read this.
Read that like I don't want to.

3408
02:29:51,020 --> 02:29:51,920
Don't want.
Man.

3409
02:29:51,921 --> 02:29:53,010
You should know.
You should know about it.

3410
02:29:53,030 --> 02:29:53,460
No,
no,

3411
02:29:53,510 --> 02:29:54,860
I shouldn't.
I shouldn't.

3412
02:29:54,861 --> 02:29:57,470
I can't know about everything.
I fucking can't.

3413
02:29:57,620 --> 02:30:00,310
There's not enough time in the day,
you know,

3414
02:30:00,311 --> 02:30:04,610
and I don't know who killed Kennedy,
but it was a long time ago and I'm done.

3415
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:05,570
Yeah,
I'm done.

3416
02:30:05,750 --> 02:30:08,210
I don't want to look into it anymore.
Maybe one day I'll change my mind,

3417
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:10,850
but you can't say that someone has to go
down.

3418
02:30:10,851 --> 02:30:12,680
These roads are.
You have to pay attention to this.

3419
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:17,920
Oh,
you have to pay attention to my work to 

3420
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:17,920
be too much.

3421
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:19,610
If you want to find out all the threats 
that isis poses to civilization,

3422
02:30:19,611 --> 02:30:20,660
cheeses,
fucking Christ.

3423
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:25,780
How much time do you have?
Do you want to find out how dangerous 

3424
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:25,780
Putin really is?
Boy,

3425
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:27,830
how much fucking time do you have?
How much time do you have?

3426
02:30:28,010 --> 02:30:33,010
Do you want to find out all the 
different potential gender roles that 

3427
02:30:33,010 --> 02:30:37,481
people play and gender identities that 
people cling to and all the different 

3428
02:30:37,481 --> 02:30:42,460
types of sexuality that exists and 
perversion and how many people jerk off 

3429
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:46,430
on feet and it's not any time.
It's high tech procrastination.

3430
02:30:46,431 --> 02:30:48,770
If you do think that way,
it keeps you away from yourself,

3431
02:30:48,980 --> 02:30:51,130
but they're putting things a little 
scary.

3432
02:30:51,170 --> 02:30:53,510
It's all scary.
Do we have more about that?

3433
02:30:53,940 --> 02:30:56,190
Do we know more about whether he has any
black shit?

3434
02:30:56,210 --> 02:30:56,880
I don't.
I don't think.

3435
02:30:56,950 --> 02:30:57,420
No,
no,

3436
02:30:57,421 --> 02:30:57,680
no,
no.

3437
02:30:57,681 --> 02:31:00,180
That came that whole story about him 
hiring.

3438
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:01,340
Yes.
That's fake news.

3439
02:31:01,341 --> 02:31:06,341
There you go.
And it came out of a fucking post on 

3440
02:31:06,341 --> 02:31:06,450
what was it on was.
Unfortunately I fell for it.

3441
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:11,560
I just felt for.
But this is the thing that's the world 

3442
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:11,560
we live in.
You know,

3443
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:14,890
this is this fake news is a real problem
and it's even bigger problem because 

3444
02:31:14,890 --> 02:31:18,950
what we consider to be legitimate news 
sources talk about it as a rumor.

3445
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:21,000
This is the rumor,
so they don't even.

3446
02:31:21,001 --> 02:31:23,580
Some say unsubstantiated reports.
You can't say that.

3447
02:31:23,581 --> 02:31:25,160
You can't even say that.
I know because I,

3448
02:31:25,210 --> 02:31:28,410
the Wall Street Journal said this has 
not been substantiated,

3449
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:33,450
but those fucks and now I'm like,
wait a minute.

3450
02:31:33,510 --> 02:31:38,130
They are dying every day.
The entire system of mainstream media is

3451
02:31:38,131 --> 02:31:43,131
slowly eroding to the Internet,
but with this is we need reliable 

3452
02:31:43,131 --> 02:31:43,131
sources.
We do,

3453
02:31:43,131 --> 02:31:47,260
we do,
but we need someone who's going to be 

3454
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:47,260
reliably do it on the Internet and I 
don't think that's impossible.

3455
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:50,670
I think we find someone who's truly 
absolutely 100 percent ethical.

3456
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:55,700
They're out there and objective and also
someone who is not just going to go 

3457
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:57,780
after fantastic stories because they 
make big ratings,

3458
02:31:57,990 --> 02:32:02,990
but someone who goes after stories that 
are actually important because their 

3459
02:32:02,990 --> 02:32:04,320
significant events and issues and does 
it in an objective way.

3460
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:09,530
Everything's editorialized.
All these things that people realize 

3461
02:32:09,530 --> 02:32:10,350
this fake.
It's fake.

3462
02:32:10,410 --> 02:32:13,170
The golden showers and all that shit 
sounded like bullshit.

3463
02:32:13,171 --> 02:32:14,670
It sounds too obvious.
Oh,

3464
02:32:14,671 --> 02:32:19,671
he.
He likes to Hire Hookers to pee on the 

3465
02:32:19,671 --> 02:32:19,671
bed that Obama slept on.
Get out of here.

3466
02:32:19,671 --> 02:32:20,700
Man.
That seems so corny.

3467
02:32:20,701 --> 02:32:22,530
Yeah,
but if he did do it,

3468
02:32:22,531 --> 02:32:27,531
I wouldn't be shocked.
I wouldn't be surprised if he was in 

3469
02:32:27,531 --> 02:32:29,361
Russia and you know that he had some 
gorgeous women with them and they have 

3470
02:32:29,361 --> 02:32:31,050
video of it that I wouldn't be surprised
by the way.

3471
02:32:31,170 --> 02:32:32,360
I don't care.
I mean either.

3472
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:37,460
I don't care.
I don't care if he hired someone to pee 

3473
02:32:37,460 --> 02:32:39,261
on the bed.
I don't care if he thinks it's funny to 

3474
02:32:39,261 --> 02:32:41,481
hire someone to pee on the bed.
I don't think that that makes him a bad 

3475
02:32:41,481 --> 02:32:44,451
person.
I think he's a rich guy who does fucked 

3476
02:32:44,451 --> 02:32:44,451
up shit sometimes because he's a rich 
guy.

3477
02:32:44,550 --> 02:32:46,650
Yeah.
I mean I wouldn't even get them to smoke

3478
02:32:46,651 --> 02:32:51,651
or drink,
so maybe that's how he gets his rocks 

3479
02:32:51,651 --> 02:32:51,651
off.
Yeah.

3480
02:32:51,651 --> 02:32:51,960
You know what?
Maybe cut a lot of ground.

3481
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:53,520
Covered a lot of talking.
I'm going to wrap this up.

3482
02:32:53,550 --> 02:32:55,410
So mixed metal arts.
I liked the new name.

3483
02:32:56,130 --> 02:32:57,840
Great.
Starting in episode two.

3484
02:32:57,841 --> 02:33:00,090
Oh,
700 miles is fantastic to hear.

3485
02:33:00,170 --> 02:33:05,170
Thanks for.
Thanks for turning me onto him and get 

3486
02:33:05,170 --> 02:33:05,440

He was wonderful and fighter and the kid

02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:11,520

Beautiful.

3498

All right.
We're done for today.

3499
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:31,780
See a kid's always a good fucking time.
