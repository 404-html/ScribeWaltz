1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,710
A fuckers were alive before we even say 
anything.

2
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:11,811
I have to do a favor for Ari.
Should fear are you should fears new 

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,561
show his show brother.
This is not happening on comedy central 

4
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:19,050
is starting a new season,
starting season two and r.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,110
He really wants to get great stories 
from comics that you guys all enjoy.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,690
So what are you suggesting you do?
Is Perhaps tweet him,

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,430
uh,
suggestions and also tweet the comics 

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,410
that you would like to see perform on 
his show.

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,500
Basically everybody's got some fucking 
wacky story.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Just one wacky story.
And if you've ever seen this is not 

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,081
happening.
It's standups telling crazy stories 

12
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,340
about either things that have happened 
to them on the road or it during life or

13
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:55,341
what have you.
It's just a slightly different form of 

14
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:56,250
standup.
So season two is about to begin.

15
00:00:56,251 --> 00:01:00,240
And Ari would like you to just tweet at 
anybody that you would think would be.

16
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,670
Don't harass anybody.
You don't twitter bond people.

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,970
That shit's gross.
People that asked me to twitter bomb,

18
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:10,971
Joe,
that's a great way to never get on this 

19
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:10,971
podcast.
I,

20
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,840
it's annoying.
It's annoying as fuck.

21
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,040
I don't like it,
uh,

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,250
but this is not that.
What he wants you to do is just get the 

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,460
word out about it and,
and tweet to him.

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,650
Anybody that you would like to see on it
that would,

25
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,640
that would help as well.
Right.

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,440
You fucks gentlemen.

27
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,670
Hey Man.
What's up brother?

28
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,530
That's funny you say that because like I
would see for like a year people go Joe 

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,660
Abdeen on your podcast and I'm like,
that's the worst way to get me on.

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,940
Well,
not necessarily if you told them to do 

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,120
it again would be the worst way.
We never did know.

32
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,130
You never would,
but a lot of people did suggested and I 

33
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,390
watched you on to dom irrera a podcast 
because of it,

34
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:52,230
which is fucking hilarious.
I've never seen donald rare life and the

35
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,680
laugh factory.
First of all,

36
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,510
dom's great guy.
Hilarious comic,

37
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,020
but it's a fun podcast and you were 
really funny on that fucking show.

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,330
Oh thanks man.
Let's rock and roll stories.

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,300
God Damn Dude.
I mean you,

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,700
you fucking,
you came into comedy it through a really

41
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:07,540
weird way.

42
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,630
Yeah.
I came to fucking long way 25 years the 

43
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,690
long way,
25 years of music played me as 25 years.

44
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:18,430
But the funny thing is,
uh,

45
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,840
when I was a kid I wanted to do comedy,
but there was no kids doing comedy,

46
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,900
you know,
it's not like now you can go to a camp 

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:27,900
or you can just do whatever,
you know,

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,610
go to the comedy camp for kids.
That's how tiffany was started.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Laugh factory comedy camp as it like a 
13 year old and same with Melissa in 

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,140
your and uh,
but when I was a kid and I'm 49,

51
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,150
so I grew up on the first couple of 
seasons of Saturday night live and I was

52
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:47,890
like,
I want to beat John Belushi.

53
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,500
GotTa be him.
But where can you be in?

54
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,910
Except for sixth grade?

55
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,220
Well,
there's open mics and stuff like that.

56
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:55,540
Like where'd you,
where'd you start out?

57
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,330
Where were you living when you were?
I

58
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,990
grew up in the bay area,
you know,

59
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,240
and uh,
San Francisco,

60
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,070
there was a mix,
but I'm like,

61
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,240
you know,
eighth grade,

62
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:06,670
you don't know about that.
There's no internet or anything.

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:06,990
Right.

64
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,980
And so you had already gotten into 
music.

65
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,740
I started playing music and then the 
years just flew by because the neighbors

66
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:15,690
piped music and,
and I love.

67
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,750
I loved rock and I love comedy.
And the seventies it was the same.

68
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:20,700
Yeah.
Cheech and Chong Carlin.

69
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,000
Richard Pryor said ACDC,
Ted Nugent,

70
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:26,250
van Halen.
They were just the same to me.

71
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,130
It put one record on and then the other.
Wow.

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,230
Yeah.
You.

73
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,850
So you lived next to musicians,
is that what got.

74
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,910
Well,
people in my neighborhood,

75
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:37,070
we all loved rock and they were like,
let's play.

76
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,930
Let's play in bands.
You know,

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,080
do you think of that wasn't around that 
you would have gotten into stand up 

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,080
early?

79
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Well,
here's the thing.

80
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,040
Standup was huge in San Francisco in the
eighties,

81
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:47,640
man.
Yeah,

82
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:50,290
we had bobcat.
We had a bobby Slayton,

83
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,900
Robin Williams.
Uh,

84
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,960
we had the uh,
that morning show with Carrie snow and 

85
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,980
all those guys,
you know,

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,700
it was huge,
but I just didn't know how to do it.

87
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:04,560
And I was probably scared.
I remember I saw dice and I was like,

88
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:08,220
I'm going to try comedy,
and I did one time at this bar,

89
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:12,660
mcnear's in Petaluma and I went in and I
was just trying to be like,

90
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:17,661
hey,
look at those tests and I swear it was 

91
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:18,880
silent.
I was like,

92
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,400
fuck you,
and I thought this is how you do it.

93
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,480
Right?
And Man,

94
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:26,760
I was tossed out of there of course

95
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,090
intangible and you see a guy like dice 
that can say like some of the most 

96
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:33,880
offensive shit first of all because you 
know him and you know,

97
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,830
like the character,
but there's also,

98
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:40,831
there's something about the way he did 
it and like if you're a young kid and 

99
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,920
you see it,
you think you could go do it too.

100
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,460
You don't realize how stupid it sounds 
until it comes out of your mouth and you

101
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,600
realize like,
oh wait a minute.

102
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,040
He's been doing this for a long time.

103
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,830
Time.
Yeah,

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,840
it's established in about.
I saw dies in 88 at the store and she 

105
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,210
really.
Well,

106
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,240
I used to hang at the store and my buddy
would like was dating the headway to 

107
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,870
Sarah and and I'd probably rock and 
Hollywood and then we'd go to the store 

108
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,640
because it was huge.
Was that before or after?

109
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:10,641
He had become gigantic before.
Because I remember seeing him and then I

110
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:14,110
think like a year later he was on the 
Rodney thing and that's like,

111
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,320
that's that guy I was telling you guys 
about,

112
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,240
but he would do Monday nights and he 
would go on and,

113
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:23,010
and all the rockers would go.
The rockers would be like,

114
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,180
you gotta see this guy man,
and you go down there and he'd come out.

115
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,350
He'd be like,
look at this whole,

116
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,070
hey,
be like,

117
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:31,950
what the fuck is this guy?
You're not getting beat up.

118
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,980
This guy was another guy laugh laughing.
He goes,

119
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
what are you left and that you're a 
fucking asshole.

120
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,950
And that guy would get up and leave.
And then it was awesome,

121
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:44,970
man.
You know?

122
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,580
Yeah.
I call it mean dice.

123
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,140
Just two different dices.
There's dice,

124
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,340
there's mean dice and mean dice will 
start picking on people in the audience 

125
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,670
and fucking just lay into dudes for like
10,

126
00:05:55,671 --> 00:05:57,340
15 minutes and you see,
they're like,

127
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,010
smile at

128
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,010
first.
I think I'll eventually get tired of 

129
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,010
picking on me.
Move on to the next guy.

130
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,290
No,
I'm not done with you.

131
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,910
I'm not done with you yet.
Please be definitely.

132
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,290
What the fuck man came to see a comedy 
show.

133
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:16,070
I didn't want to be a part of it.
Brutalize people,

134
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,630
radical but hilarious.

135
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,520
It was radical back then.
You know,

136
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:24,521
everybody's just flying around a coke 
and his eighties and there's rock bands 

137
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,840
and and great comedy going on.

138
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,890
That's what's different now.
That's a big thing that's different now 

139
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:30,890
is coke.
The comedians are not on coke.

140
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,570
There's not a lot of comics on coke.
That's all we'd.

141
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,170
There's a few that drink,
but as far as like doing coke,

142
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:42,171
maybe a couple of them might do it,
but it's not like a Kennison thing were.

143
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,450
They're all just getting blasted like 
you've heard Mark Marin's Kennison 

144
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:47,450
stories.
Awesome.

145
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,060
The fucking,
the one about doing coke for like 78 

146
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,831
hours and hallucinating for a year.
He was hearing voices for a fucking 

147
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:59,600
year.
He had voices talking in his head for a 

148
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,600
year after that.

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,600
That was the era man.
I mean,

150
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,160
I did coke every.
Not every day,

151
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,800
but like all of the time he just did 
coke.

152
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,630
It was just what you did,
man.

153
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,310
It was rock coke and,
and you know.

154
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,790
And it wasn't about getting high.
It was just about.

155
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,480
Keep Rolling.
Let's keep this rolling.

156
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,420
Man.
Rock.

157
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,590
You don't want to quit?
No.

158
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,260
They want to go to bed.
Let's go bowling.

159
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,560
Then the liquor store will be open.
We'll hit that.

160
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,280
Then we'll go to this party and the 
canyon.

161
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,760
Oh God.
That's great.

162
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,470
Open.
It's fun.

163
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,440
That's insane.
It's crossed out.

164
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,170
I worshiped sleep so much now.
I'm like,

165
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,190
I know when you're young you'll put that
sleep off.

166
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,710
Just like I could stay up.
I've done that many times.

167
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:40,320
Just stayed up and just figure it out.
Go to bed tonight.

168
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,540
You go to bed tonight.
Just ride it out.

169
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,710
And then the last few hours of your day,
you're just a Zombie.

170
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,080
Just were such bitches.
We need sleep.

171
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:54,081
We don't get that sleep.
You're like working at like 40 percent 

172
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,781
capacity.
Like you have to struggle with 

173
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:56,781
everything you do.
Yeah.

174
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:56,781
Hilarious.

175
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:57,440
Right?
Like I get angry when I don't get sleep,

176
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,210
man.
Fuck this crowd.

177
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,360
I remember being young though thinking 
like just feeling like shit after 

178
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,180
pulling an all nighter and thinking the 
difference between me then and me now is

179
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:14,181
I'm probably more aware of how I feel 
like shit now I'm more aware of what my 

180
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:18,351
body actually requires.
When you're 20 years old and you do 

181
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:18,351
something like that,
you don't think anything of it.

182
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:19,810
You just go.
One was taller.

183
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

184
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,190
The endurance is crazy.
When you're young,

185
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:24,410
you're just,
it's weird.

186
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,480
You can lay there and when you hear your
body working,

187
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,180
that's scary.
When it's just gone,

188
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,140
boom,
boom,

189
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,730
boom,
boom.

190
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,650
And you think about what you've made it 
do.

191
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,740
It's just all booze and drugs in you and
you haven't eaten in a couple of days 

192
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,851
that sprouts.
So how old were you when you got into 

193
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:44,120
stand up?
A 44.

194
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,580
I've been doing it for five and a half 
years.

195
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:49,760
Exactly last week.
Twenty 600 spots.

196
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,420
That's a fucking hustle dude.
It was weird.

197
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,200
Joe.
This is a true story.

198
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:59,201
When I started thinking of doing comedy,
all the guys though have during the 

199
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:00,360
forties,
you know,

200
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:03,030
it's like you see K,
uh,

201
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,150
Tom,
papa was watching a lot burger and I 

202
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,910
had,
I was really naive thinking like that.

203
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:12,470
It's not an age thing like rock,
you know,

204
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,390
Dr Rosa,
Rockstar.

205
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,630
There's only a few guys that get to that
Mick Jagger level where you can do 

206
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:19,640
whatever the fuck you want

207
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,360
and they're looked at as like eno,
old rockers or whatever.

208
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,030
But comedians aren't looked at as old 
comics.

209
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,350
They're looked at as comics because 
they're,

210
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:35,351
the.
Most of the killers are in their 

211
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:35,351
forties.
You know,

212
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:35,351
the guys I left.

213
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:35,440
Well,
there's,

214
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,970
there's something about your insight 
when you get into your forties that is 

215
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:40,970
probably missing when you're in your 
thirties.

216
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,901
So can you throw that.
You can be really funny when you're in 

217
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:46,020
your thirties,
but it's very rare that you find someone

218
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,240
in their thirties that has like the 
insight of a Louis,

219
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:48,760
c,
k,

220
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,170
like the point of view,
the unique perspective of a burger.

221
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,090
You know?
It's like,

222
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,490
it takes a lot of living to become that 
guy.

223
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,520
Yeah.
If you got it,

224
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,170
you have to travel or think.
Yeah,

225
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,660
you do.

226
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,620
You may have to come to their own.
You have to understand your own bullshit

227
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:08,621
too,
which a lot of times you don't yet when 

228
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:08,621
you're in your thirties,
when you're in your thirties,

229
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:09,860
even if you're really funny,
you might have some funny points.

230
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:11,810
You probably don't understand your own 
bullshit yet.

231
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Yeah.
You got to admit to yourself and figure 

232
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,860
it out.
I'm fucking shitty in some ways.

233
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:19,690
Yeah,
and then you talk about it on stage.

234
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,200
Did you

235
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,300
go to aa or one of those things where 
you stand on a podium and make people 

236
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,910
laugh?
That's how a lot of guys start.

237
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,550
Yeah,
and I didn't do that.

238
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:31,150
What happened was I drank and did coke 
every night,

239
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:34,150
but I sang every night and had three 
guys in my band.

240
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,470
I was losing my voice,
so I go to the doctor and he goes,

241
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,490
you can't drink alcohol.
It dries out your folk accords,

242
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,400
you've got like what they call pre 
notes,

243
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,790
which is like calluses on your vocal 
cords like Adele God or Steven Tyler or 

244
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:56,241
as Paul Stanley,
and you got to go in and get them 

245
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:56,241
lasered off.
You won't be able to sing for six months

246
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,650
and when the,
when you're making a living even two 

247
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:01,810
days off,
even with comedy,

248
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,110
that completely makes the machine 
crumble.

249
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,480
So my guys are like,
hey you,

250
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,860
you,
you can't drink.

251
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:09,450
You know,
we've got,

252
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,740
we've got to eat.
And I felt like that too.

253
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:12,400
I was like,
alright,

254
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,440
I gotta quit for a little bit and see 
what happens.

255
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Then after three weeks went by,
I felt fantastic and and I just never 

256
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,290
looked back.
She never got it lasered?

257
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,440
No.
What I did was he told me two things.

258
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:28,441
Quit drinking.
Don't talk all day and don't talk after 

259
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:32,311
gigs and I just chilled for like three 
weeks and they slow and a lot of Ricole 

260
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:35,250
was throat coat tea and uh,
and,

261
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,420
and,
and the number one thing I did wrong,

262
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,760
which people don't know was when you 
clear your throat,

263
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:44,761
it's the worst thing you can do when you
go to the banks and vocal chords 

264
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:50,071
together.
And that's the worst thing you can do 

265
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,250
for maybe just a bitch.
And I spoke with my vocal cords.

266
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,390
Don't mind rumbling a little bit.

267
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,050
Welcome cards,
lift weights to getting jacked,

268
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,110
running hills.
So you,

269
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,000
that was what made you quit drinking 
like,

270
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,240
well,
I hadn't hit a rock bottom.

271
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,940
Cool.
I mean I was getting pretty radical.

272
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:11,340
I threw a beer and an anr guys face

273
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,620
that.
What's an a and r guy that's a radio 

274
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:17,620
artist residence.
The guy that signs,

275
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:17,870
you know,
record labels.

276
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,130
Oh really?
Yeah.

277
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,830
So we're doing a showcase for what does 
it stand for?

278
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:23,870
Artists and residents.
Representative

279
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,710
mentors are a represented artists were 
relations,

280
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,190
customer relations.
You threw a beer in his face.

281
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,710
We're doing a showcase and there was a 
bunch of record labels come down to see 

282
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,251
us.
They're all hot and right before we go 

283
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,951
on a,
they all start leaving our managers 

284
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:44,951
like,
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

285
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,550
They were all leaving and so he calls 
him the next day and they go,

286
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:49,670
well,
such and such said he signed you guys,

287
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:52,640
uh,
yesterday at lunch and so we left.

288
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,150
It was like a scam.
He did take and watch this on his own.

289
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,480
So I saw him about a month later I was 
pretty drunk at an awards show and I 

290
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,290
just had a beer and just right on his 
face and topics and I was like,

291
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,530
yeah,
that's probably not good.

292
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,400
Good for the business.

293
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,710
Later though,
I seen him later and he's like,

294
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:16,210
that's pretty pretty gangster and really
gangster.

295
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,870
Yeah,
he knew it was like,

296
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,180
that's like the GNRH or rockers

297
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,580
crazy.
The fuck the guns and roses era.

298
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,620
Did you,
were you around for that?

299
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,450
Yeah.
Did you see them come up?

300
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,230
I saw him come up big time.
Yeah.

301
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,290
Uh,
I played in that whole scene,

302
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:31,890
you know,

303
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,360
like,
man,

304
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:38,361
that seems like one of the weirdest 
errors of Hollywood because it seems 

305
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:40,740
like a rock and roll era that nobody 
really saw coming like a late eighties,

306
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,160
I mean outside of them.
And there was,

307
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,740
there's quite a few big bands from back 
then,

308
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:49,220
but not necessarily big bands from La,
you know,

309
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,910
they were so much better than everybody 
else.

310
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,890
You had them.
And Jane's addiction really,

311
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,230
those were the two and they played gigs 
together and stuff.

312
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,950
When you think about the two styles are 
totally different,

313
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:04,951
but they're both the uh,
the recipes are the same danger and 

314
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,810
whenever you have something really 
fucking dangerous,

315
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,870
it's gonna.
It's gonna hit with kids because you 

316
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,870
know,
you're coming out of that Reagan era and

317
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,330
everything's kind of shitty and it's 
like comedy was big in the eighties,

318
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:17,890
you know,
when it's bad,

319
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,860
people grab onto it and you had a long 
time,

320
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,230
have a bad music,
you know,

321
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,790
you had a bunch of Super Glam spandex 
stuff and then this thing comes in.

322
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:32,110
Welcome to the jungle and it feels real.
And the whole record is good.

323
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:34,570
That's why it made it.
It wasn't one,

324
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:35,530
two songs.

325
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,340
Yeah.
The record's fantastic.

326
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:40,730
But if you look at the original video 
for welcome to the jungle,

327
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:45,731
he had t up here.
He's on the borderline of the Glam 

328
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:49,871
thing.
Like somebody must've talked him into 

329
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:50,060
dressing like that,
or he didn't know any better yet,

330
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,670
but he hair was like Farrah Fawcett

331
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,170
or something.
She's seen Dean's hair,

332
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:59,171
man.
It's just pictures that we could see 

333
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:02,020
online on instagram page or anything 
that we could find.

334
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,030
The Dean del Rey.
There's tons of pictures of me on there 

335
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,310
from the old days they find me will find
it.

336
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,230
Well,
I want to see axl rose first.

337
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,220
Welcome to the jungle.
Yeah.

338
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Because it changed.
Then it was black bandanas and greasy 

339
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,240
hair and the heroin.
Look,

340
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,190
he went from the hairband look to the 
heroin.

341
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:20,360
Look,
now you know,

342
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,630
I remember specifically seeing them.
This was the turning point.

343
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,390
They were grinding out and the record 
came out.

344
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:29,430
You know that record failed when it 
first came out.

345
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:32,040
People don't know the first single 
bombed.

346
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,280
Really?
What was the first time?

347
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,650
The jungle,
that was the first bomb dudes like it,

348
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,610
but it wasn't,
you know,

349
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:39,410
it took.
We had to wait till you get the sweet.

350
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,770
Was there.
Look at that photo.

351
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,610
Photos.
Slightly grungy,

352
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,880
but you know what it is.
It's like you tried to be grunge there.

353
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,880
You worked it,
you know like that's your hair.

354
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:58,040
Doesn't stick up that watch.
No,

355
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,060
no.
That's hairspray.

356
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,650
She worked in a chemical plant.

357
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,490
You gotta think though,
man,

358
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,600
that is this era.
When you look at this,

359
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:09,780
and I always describe this to people and
you have tattoos.

360
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,610
I have tattoos in this era of the 
eighties when you had tattoos,

361
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,240
that meant you were never working a 
regular job at that time.

362
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:21,390
Now you look at Chipola,
you work at starbucks wherever,

363
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,320
but at that time that meant no one was 
hiring.

364
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:30,000
You accept construction or landscaping.
You weren't going to get a job,

365
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:34,020
so that was a c.
I mean he has multiple giant tattoos to.

366
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,390
Yeah,
he just went out now

367
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,530
18 year old kids that have sleeves.
Exactly.

368
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Side food boobs in fifth grade.
I always say I don't think I got enough 

369
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,410
tattoos to work at Chipola yeah,
and ladies,

370
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:50,411
what's up with the.
The inspirational quotes below the side 

371
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:52,250
boob.
So that is becoming.

372
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,640
That is the,
that is the fucking barbwire around the 

373
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,870
bicep.
The 2015 errors,

374
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,780
the inspirational quote on your side 
boots,

375
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,870
the new tramp stamp.
It's always like some fucking Ralph 

376
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,830
Waldo emerson quote or or something 
biblical.

377
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,350
It's never good.
Like a Charles Bukowski thing.

378
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:13,910
You know,
like I'm a day drinker.

379
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,530
He was,
he was another one.

380
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:20,840
That's one of my favorite 
representations of Hollywood.

381
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,370
God

382
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,190
love you.
I know.

383
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,300
That's why I like,
like I like you.

384
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,900
I like guys that are dangerous and,
and I'm attracted to the edge.

385
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,500
A dislike.

386
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,730
Are you living on the edge?
It's funny.

387
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:43,871
Dean is now addicted to candy though.
I went over and crash cans full of candy

388
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,140
wrappers.

389
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,630
That's why I like listening to the ego 
because it's like I'm trying to get 

390
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:51,630
healthy

391
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:51,870
for real.
I quit caffeine.

392
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:57,110
I don't smoke.
I don't drink because I don't want to 

393
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,780
die.
I worked seven nights a week,

394
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:02,670
man,
and I don't ever eat fast food ever,

395
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,670
but you can do.
It's bad.

396
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,860
Well,
Ari and I are trying to quit,

397
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,340
so we cut one day.
I've.

398
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,880
I'm up to two days now.
Sometimes three.

399
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,890
Yes.
Sugar can be really addictive.

400
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,340
You know why it's brutal because you've 
been doing it since you were two.

401
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,710
You start drugs maybe when you're 18,
19,

402
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,390
but to your cereals,
loaded.

403
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,660
Your drinks are loaded.
Fucking breads loaded.

404
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,130
Fucking broad,
right?

405
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,960
The first day I quit smoking,
I eight,

406
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:32,961
six packs of Mentos and now I have the 
hugest canker sores in my mouth so I can

407
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,590
tell from from just eating too much 
candy and it hurts really bad.

408
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,990
I don't know if it's from that though.
It could be with you.

409
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:44,470
It can be like you.
What are you willing to analysts like?

410
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,440
You've observed all your illnesses.
Well,

411
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:49,260
I know this one,
this one came from Toronto.

412
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,000
You don't know where these sores are 
coming from.

413
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:57,660
They just on your face so wrong.
So we're going to.

414
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,950
Toronto,
man will be there next month.

415
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,310
I love Toronto.
Me To write the dudes up there,

416
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,840
uh,
I did that room and they were talking 

417
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:08,840
about you and they're like,
what's the epic night?

418
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,120
The comedy underground there.
And they had the punk club.

419
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,180
Yeah,
they had a picture of it in there and 

420
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,180
stuff.
And they're like,

421
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,180
I've done it a few times.
It's so good.

422
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,290
That place is weird because it makes you
realize you can get a secondhand buzz 

423
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,250
real easy.
I used to think that like secondhand,

424
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,920
like getting high second hand was 
bullshit.

425
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,720
Not Enough fucking room.
No Way.

426
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,760
Go in that room.
You can't even see the back of the room 

427
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,580
and the room is only 20 feet deep.
You can't see it.

428
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
It's the,
it's one of the few places that actually

429
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:41,160
made Doug Benson Green out where he 
passed out in the middle of the lobby.

430
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,660
And then Tony,
Tony Hinchcliffe got off stage and he 

431
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,300
took off his shirt and went outside and 
almost fell down.

432
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,170
Oh my God.
I was headlining in there and I doing an

433
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,200
hour and smoke weed and my 30 minutes in
my throat was like someone shaved it 

434
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:04,131
with sandpaper.
And then I was completely and I was up 

435
00:20:04,131 --> 00:20:06,750
there like this kinda cool man.
You know where I'm at?

436
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,040
Yeah.
They can hop box.

437
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,820
Any person in the world.
Just the air in there.

438
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,990
It's so thc filters.
No.

439
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:14,250
Really Aaron there.
None.

440
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,030
None.
No.

441
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,910
It's all pots movement.
And now they're all doing that.

442
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,080
Um,
that uh,

443
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,750
dabbing.
So they're straight zombies.

444
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,110
That's correct.
I mean they are.

445
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:30,111
Zombies explained Dabbin.
What's the difference between dabbing 

446
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:30,300
it?
Smoking weed.

447
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,560
They get this,
uh,

448
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,350
this is the wax,
like the oil light.

449
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:37,530
So I cash exactly.
But it's even stronger they say.

450
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:42,531
And then they've got this electrical 
fucking wand and they kind of rub it 

451
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:43,860
over it and then they suck in this,
this,

452
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,740
you know,
this like the word straight thc.

453
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:48,810
There's no weed.
How does the uh,

454
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,360
the,
the,

455
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,910
the waiver of what over it?

456
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,760
It's pretty much exactly like smoking 
crack foil.

457
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,050
But it's in a nice glass thing.
So you think it's not,

458
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,310
it's hash or anything like that?

459
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,630
Yes,
it's doing the exact same thing.

460
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,990
But when you start seeing this guy who,
uh,

461
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,400
was my,
what?

462
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,860
He wasn't in an agent,
he was my,

463
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,190
it wasn't my agent.
He was my manager's friend who was also 

464
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,250
an agent.
He lit some Hash Hash on a,

465
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,120
like a,
um,

466
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,200
a thumbtack.
You put the piece of Hash on the 

467
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,200
thumbtack and lit it on fire,
then put it under a glass.

468
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Oh yeah.
And let it fill the glass up and they 

469
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,200
lifted glass.
I'm going to go.

470
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Great.
This guy is a drug addict.

471
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,080
Yeah.
That's all I could think of was this guy

472
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,990
was a drug addict.
Like if you just lit a joint,

473
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,190
like I was just,
I didn't,

474
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,280
I had no idea what the fuck.
So hey fuck hash was back then and look 

475
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,601
at all the tools and the English,
they carry a briefcase with prosperous.

476
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,070
Like Ari and I were in Sacramento at the
punchline and this guy goes,

477
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,380
come out to the car.
He opened his trunk and he had like a,

478
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,850
a DAB center.
What is going on here?

479
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:58,840
So this guy's just hanging on there and 
she's sort of working it while he,

480
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,850
uh,
turning and she's pretty much burning 

481
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:03,850
it.
But Joe,

482
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,180
now they have state of the art things.
They're like electric wand and and,

483
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,550
and it rubs over it.
There's no fire.

484
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:12,610
It's like electric.
This is why potheads have a bad name.

485
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:13,850
Exactly.
Total.

486
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,080
He's guys waiting in line to get their 
brains obliterated.

487
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,360
I think I told you this,
Joe,

488
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:23,890
that I recently was in San Francisco and
there was one of these places across the

489
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:28,360
street from the comedy club and me,
tiffany haddish and Tony went across the

490
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:33,361
street to check out this damn place and 
there was like half of the people were 

491
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:36,550
homeless that were just sitting there 
spinning their money anywhere though.

492
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,950
But it was,
it was like being in a crack house and 

493
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,401
it was just,
it looked like people were doing crack 

494
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:44,401
and people were passed out like a crack 
house.

495
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,580
The same thing because crack is like an 
elevated thing.

496
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:49,080
Like you get whacked out.
Right.

497
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,720
But this is just zombied from we'd.
Yup.

498
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,260
Yeah.
And they are really Zombie though,

499
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:59,261
Joe.
I'm talking about you're looking at a 

500
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:00,781
guy two feet away and you're going to,
this guy's fucking dead and you're doing

501
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:07,501
comedy for them for the night of the 
living dead places.

502
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,670
There's a place in north Hollywood,
so the spot,

503
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,680
the spot where where it's a dive bar and
it's a comedy stage and me and Freddy 

504
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Lockhart for try this place for me and 
Freddy Book took a hit and then we 

505
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:27,391
walked outside and it makes you cough 
and these meet me and Freddy cough for 

506
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:27,730
like 30 minutes and we couldn't even 
talk.

507
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,370
I can't breathe and then we had to go on
stage.

508
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,940
Nobody was paying attention.
They were looking through you.

509
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,370
They were like figuring out like talking
to Jerry and you're like,

510
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:41,371
they have no idea what was going on.
One guy was face down in onto the stage 

511
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:43,510
in front of me and I'm like,
we're going to check on this guy

512
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,060
jokes.
It's amazing.

513
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:55,061
Their pot really can't kill you.
If you had thought that was some of 

514
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:56,360
these dab guys with some of these people
that are,

515
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,570
that have these crazy contraptions like 
these ridiculous vaporizers somewhere 

516
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,170
online.
Someone must've fucking hit the wall.

517
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,630
Nobody.
Nobody ever.

518
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,480
I felt like I was dying on wait many 
times.

519
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,710
Oh yeah.
Wait,

520
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,760
about five,
six,

521
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,130
seven years ago.
I got back into we big time before I 

522
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,240
started comedy and I was like,
Whoa,

523
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,180
this isn't 80 sweet,
you know,

524
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:25,181
like one hit my heart with Guinness.
It's definitely a totally different 

525
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:29,681
experience.
But apparently this kind of weed was 

526
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:29,681
available if you,
uh,

527
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:33,890
you check the has been some scientists 
that have done some studies on the 

528
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,440
different strains and like what the pope
potential potency.

529
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,430
Apparently there was some pretty fucking
strong weed back in the day,

530
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:42,410
like Acapulco gold used to call it.

531
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,630
You could get ahold of some really 
strong weed,

532
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,110
but the strongest we'd today is stronger
than that and that weed was rare.

533
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,940
So like,
you know,

534
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,780
like you'll get a hold of some today,
but that's not that good.

535
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:59,090
But most of the week today is pretty 
fucking good.

536
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,130
It was really rarely you would get like 
quality California weed back then I just

537
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:05,870
asked my uncle at the same thing and I 
was like,

538
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:06,890
you know about it?
He goes,

539
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:07,250
no,
there,

540
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,260
it was available.
I had heard of it,

541
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,100
but he like,
he's like,

542
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,960
I smoked weed every day.
I never saw it.

543
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,770
I went to Cannabis Cup and uh,
and you,

544
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:20,810
you,
they take it out there and you can vote 

545
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,191
on the weed.
It's in Amsterdam once a year and then 

546
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:24,810
the winners,
it's a big deal because the winter is,

547
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,710
are these seeds for big money.
That was a judge,

548
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,180
judge at one in La.
So it was a blizzard rated.

549
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,520
I have no idea what anything tasted 
liked.

550
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,770
White widow number five.
Give me a,

551
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,610
like a box,
like,

552
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,550
and it had,
you know,

553
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,190
all those things that people do for 
vitamins where they have Monday,

554
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:43,760
Tuesday,
Wednesday,

555
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,090
it's all labeled and top and you pop up 
each individual.

556
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:52,091
They had one of those filled with weed 
and they give it to you a good fucking 

557
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:56,341
luck remembering what anything in that 
first three people you try one every 

558
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:58,670
year properly.
It's like relationships.

559
00:25:58,671 --> 00:25:59,750
It's like your friend,
like,

560
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,460
oh,
this is my friend's shit man.

561
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:01,890
You know,
like they,

562
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:06,260
they don't check to see if anybody.
And it's also just random.

563
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:08,110
It's fucking totally random.
Yeah.

564
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Standards Tastes pretty good.
Like some of it has like a different 

565
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,561
kind of flavor to it,
but not enough that you had awarded 

566
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:18,920
anything.
I'm a black hash guy.

567
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,440
I'm glad that more than anything it 
tastes great.

568
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,150
The what's Black Hash?
Just black cash.

569
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:29,151
It's like that oily black cash.
It's made out of the oil and you can 

570
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:30,120
kind of pull it off.
Like now it looks like a.

571
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,980
Oh,
like a ball,

572
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,140
like a tar ball.
He peel,

573
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,820
peel a piece off.
It's like,

574
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,640
tastes great man.
And it's a different high.

575
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,690
Yeah.
Well it's,

576
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,720
it's when you eating hash,
especially if you're eating it,

577
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,280
if even if you're smoking,
you're getting a different.

578
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,320
It's,
it's like a vaporizer high more than 

579
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,030
it's like a joint high.
I like it better to you.

580
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,850
Yeah,
because it's,

581
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,100
I think it's more mellow for me,
you know?

582
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,100
It doesn't seem to grab me and go,
you're heart,

583
00:26:56,101 --> 00:27:01,101
you're shitting your pants.
I always think I'm shitting my pants on 

584
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:01,820
weed.
Like I feel like there's no,

585
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,260
no feeling below.

586
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,500
I usually feel the opposite of feeling 
of too much feeling going on all the 

587
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,410
different processes that are happening,
feel at all,

588
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,680
but it does loosen up.
The bowels now does get you where you 

589
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:18,890
want to take your Chinese shit.
Scared of.

590
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,300
When was the last time?
When was the last time you smoked weed?

591
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,170
Probably five years ago.
Right when I started comedy I realized I

592
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:27,720
had to quit because it was wiping out my
short term memory.

593
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:30,540
I'd be on stage in a bag.
Fuck what's next?

594
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,290
I couldn't remember.
Wow.

595
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,120
I could not remember what was next,
but I can remember 20 years ago and this

596
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,930
was a no party and back then the 
drinking was done.

597
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,900
Oh yeah.
I stopped drinking in [inaudible] 92.

598
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,360
No coke,
no booze since [inaudible] 92.

599
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,160
And that's all because of the throat?
Yeah,

600
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:52,161
pretty much.
And then I realized I gotta get my shit 

601
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:52,161
together.
I burned it up hard joe.

602
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,810
I mean hard.
So like guys like Paul Stanley,

603
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,070
Paul Stanley never drank,
right?

604
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,860
No he didn't.
Those guys were a clean dudes.

605
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,750
But you know,
you can trash your voice.

606
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,280
He you to think Paul every night.
He's like,

607
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:03,330
yeah,

608
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,740
yeah,

609
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:07,800
no,
he,

610
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,330
that's all he ever does.
When he's,

611
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,610
when he's talking,
he's like,

612
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,300
he never stops there.
I must be way easier to sing.

613
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:27,301
Now.
You got into your monitors there in the 

614
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:29,740
middle.
Get the fuck outta jail with the boys.

615
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,820
You ridiculous Picchu.
Oh my God.

616
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,690
On the left.
That's me with tracie guns from La guns.

617
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:41,020
What do these guys look like?
They look the same possible.

618
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:46,050
Fire up a photo.
I think I have a photo like two days 

619
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,490
later of La guns have.
Tracy does a podcast with me and right.

620
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:49,930
There you go.
There's us,

621
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:55,050
there's tracy on the left.
That's the guy on the right from the 

622
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,050
bullet.
Boys do not look the same.

623
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,510
I mean they didn't even remotely.
Glasses.

624
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,660
Look at my shirt,
right?

625
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:02,560
Snake.
Steven,

626
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,120
right?
It's hilarious.

627
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,770
Steven,
right?

628
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:07,120
Man,
do you have the picture of you?

629
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,750
And uh,
that's.

630
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,400
There was that dude have a che Guevara 
tattooed on his chest.

631
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,600
I wonder how much he really knows about 
Che Guevara.

632
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:21,780
There's a lot of people that got Che 
Guevara Tattoos that didn't know a 

633
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,541
goddamn thing about Che Guevara.
He just wanted to look cool and I find 

634
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:28,720
it more old pictures of the roses.
It's towards the beginning.

635
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,950
If you're in my instagram,
the beginning of the other one,

636
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:37,030
it started my instagram feed,
but when you very start,

637
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:39,090
when I first started out or Jamiel fine.
Yeah,

638
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,100
he'll get it.
So you did it for all those years you 

639
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,611
did music and then what,
what made you decide to do like an open 

640
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:47,611
mic night?

641
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:52,440
Well,
what happened was I stopped playing 

642
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,141
music basically because once the 
download and came in the illegal 

643
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,890
download and there's just no money for 
a,

644
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,140
a,
a mid level musician anymore.

645
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:01,840
You know,
like when I played music,

646
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,620
you can play music for years and just be
touring like the jam bands,

647
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:10,621
you know,
like a Kinda grateful Dead Blues 

648
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:10,621
Traveler,
Black Crows,

649
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:14,611
that kind of thing.
And make some money selling cds and 

650
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:16,170
shirts.
But once people just grabbed the cds,

651
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:18,280
it was out like guys,
we'd come home,

652
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,780
we'd be like,
we got 400 bucks.

653
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,210
We'd been out three months.
Yeah.

654
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:26,050
So that's cool for me,
but when he got band members with wives,

655
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:26,890
they're like,
Hey,

656
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,600
you've been gone for three months,
you have no money and no.

657
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:36,030
So I stopped and I started working at 
Harley Harley Davidson.

658
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:37,990
I was like,
oh,

659
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:42,991
I guess I'll just do this,
but when you've been on stage 25 years 

660
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:43,540
it starts to fuck with it.

661
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,290
You're like,
man,

662
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:49,291
I gotta be here at nine and then I got 
to be here all day and for selling 

663
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:55,171
bikes.
So you were like a bike sales over in 

664
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:55,171
van nuys.
Wow.

665
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:58,390
I actually liked it but it was,
it.

666
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,780
It's just so different from us at the 
death of a dream.

667
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:03,640
Like I kinda really felt like that.
Yeah,

668
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,170
I felt pretty,
uh,

669
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,890
I was really depressed and I was angry.
Yeah.

670
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,620
Because I was just kinda like,
fuck these guys,

671
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,550
you know,
you got a guy come in and you spend four

672
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:18,551
or five hours,
you're on commission and then they go 

673
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:20,860
somewhere else and they come over with 
their bike.

674
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:21,610
Like,
hey man,

675
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:23,050
look,
I bought one.

676
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,450
They don't know that you're on 
commission.

677
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,320
I guess I went over there,
they had,

678
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,870
they gave me a shirt and you're like,
fuck,

679
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:34,270
I made no money today,
you know?

680
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,010
Yeah.
It really is.

681
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:41,150
It's annoying.
The annoying thing about being a 

682
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,150
salesman,
right?

683
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,160
It's brutal.
But there's

684
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,870
con or comedy as.
I'm not like a sales.

685
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:46,310
You know what I mean?
Like,

686
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:51,311
because you're,
you're constantly trying to get stage 

687
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:53,891
time and,
and with sales you're constantly hoping 

688
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:53,891
somebody says yes.

689
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,840
Salesmen is weird too because you're 
kind of a professional manipulator and a

690
00:31:57,841 --> 00:31:58,180
lot of,
oh,

691
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,270
it's horrible.
I told her this,

692
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:05,271
I got a lot of times you feel like a 
drug dealer because you're selling 

693
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:06,660
something to somebody that's proud 
they're probably going to die on,

694
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,700
you know what I mean?
Like what do you mean?

695
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:14,890
Because they just don't know.
They don't know how to ride and you're 

696
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,710
just there like here,
like,

697
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,890
Hey,
you took the school,

698
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,120
right?
Oh yeah,

699
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:23,121
yeah.
And they're lying and they just rolled 

700
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:23,121
out and he goes,
that guy has no idea.

701
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:26,550
He's on two wheels and he's going under 
fan eyes boulevard right now.

702
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:32,150
Either one of the most brutal streets.
And I've been watching so many ever 

703
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,840
since I got rear ended the other day.
I've been watching so many people 

704
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,220
texting in the fucking car.
God Damn folks got to stop doing that.

705
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,130
It's brutal.
Oh everybody

706
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,040
thinks they can pull it off.
And you see people doing this as they're

707
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,900
driving,
looking down and looking up,

708
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:46,370
looking down,
looking up like fuck.

709
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,370
The amount of time you cover while 
you're looking down,

710
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,710
going straight forward before you look 
up again.

711
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,840
You're talking about sometimes 20,
30 feet bay at a time and that's 20,

712
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:01,841
30 feet.
The you didn't hit the brakes at 

713
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:01,841
something popped up in front of you and 
that's too late.

714
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:06,041
And boom.
Old Ladies flying through the air 

715
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:06,041
because you just walked out into 
traffic.

716
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:10,120
Yeah man.
I mean even even when you're not 

717
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,911
texting,
how many times did the one on one or 

718
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:12,911
you're like,
well fuck shit,

719
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:14,990
look at this wall and now you're adding 
texting into it.

720
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,880
I've watched some lady with a kid in her
car today.

721
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,240
She was doing that thing that sometimes 
people they take driving and the it 

722
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,520
turns into like a sport.
They try to like get in front of the car

723
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:31,550
to the left.
It was a two lane road and she was 

724
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,771
trying to get in front of,
there was a guy to my right and there 

725
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:37,071
was a guy that was in front of us.
There was like a little bit of gap 

726
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:41,211
between me and him and she was trying to
speed and get into that gap and right 

727
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:42,630
when she was trying to speed someone 
else came into her lane,

728
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:47,631
they weren't paying attention and she 
had a kid in her car and she had a slam 

729
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:48,360
on the brake and go flying into the,
uh,

730
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,390
into the side of the emergency role.
And I watched her do it and I watched 

731
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,221
her afterwards.
She was like touching the kid's chest 

732
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:00,651
and talking to him,
trying to console him because the kid 

733
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:00,651
freaked out because she didn't need to 
do it.

734
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:01,200
There was no,
no reason to do it.

735
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,600
And she drove normal.
After that she was behind me.

736
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:05,670
The entire whale.
I kept an eye on her,

737
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,710
but I was like this,
this was just like a game,

738
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,570
like she wanted to make that gap.
Some

739
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,570
girl I was on Laurel Canyon and she came
right up to me like right onto my ass 

740
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,130
and start flashing her lights,
like what the fuck is this lady doing?

741
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,970
And then she tries to pass me and it 
pushes me off the side of the road.

742
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:24,340
As another car starts coming.
Then she slams on the brake,

743
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,300
goes behind me.
I'm like,

744
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:30,301
what the fuck?
Like she literally tried to like 

745
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,340
sideswiped me and then she gets ahead of
me and it kept slamming on her brakes 

746
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,850
and brake checking me.
So finally,

747
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,380
by the way,
this is all on periscope.

748
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,560
I finally got her ceiling up here.
Now you want to watch wanting to get 

749
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:49,831
past that was like,
look at this guy and I know I have a 

750
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:54,360
dash mount so it's just sitting there.
But then we get to a stoplight and I 

751
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,360
could pull up next to.

752
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,680
I rolled down my window like,
what the fuck is your problem?

753
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,080
And said girl with her hair really 
short.

754
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,200
She just sitting there like that and she
takes off in front of me and it's 

755
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,200
brakes,
checks,

756
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,200
man,
but what the fuck?

757
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,110
A second light,
same thing or whatever.

758
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,080
Hey,
hey Yo,

759
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,150
you and she rolls down the window,
gives me the SMIRK,

760
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:11,500
like say like,
like that.

761
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,230
And then when it turns white she just 
tries to side slamming again.

762
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:19,000
You should run into her and then killer.
And then periscope.

763
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,220
If I got her license plates,
periscope murder.

764
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:26,790
I got her license plate number and I 
realized how easy it is to get 

765
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,150
information from a license plate.
I had no idea.

766
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,940
It's just a $40 google search.
What's her name?

767
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,450
What's his guy?
He's really hot though.

768
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:39,451
So she gets a pass.
She gets a pass passed so weak you will 

769
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:45,180
live your life in torture and you will 
never learn.

770
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,140
That's true.
Bone structure gives her a pass.

771
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,200
She's like half Japanese.
Half Mexican is just what is wrong with 

772
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:56,850
you?
What is wrong with you son?

773
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,840
Somebody sideswiped my car the other 
day.

774
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:03,300
$7,000
worth of damage to my car.

775
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:08,330
Just parked in front of my street and I 
had a drop cam and that that faces my 

776
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:12,801
front of my house and so I caught.
I caught the person like driving by and 

777
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:15,750
it was so fast that I couldn't even see 
anything.

778
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,400
It was just like they hit the car behind
me,

779
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,670
hit my car and was going on hammered 
probably 30 miles an hour.

780
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:20,700
Yeah.

781
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Wow.
This happens like once every three 

782
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,220
months I'll drive down one of these 
little side streets.

783
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:31,221
I was on a van,
Owen and Van Owen had this car that 

784
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:35,360
someone obviously hit full speed in the 
rear and it was parked on the side of 

785
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:40,611
the road because people are texting or 
they're drunk or they fall asleep or 

786
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:44,091
something and those cars that are parked
every couple months I'll see one just 

787
00:36:44,091 --> 00:36:45,000
caved in on the side of the road and you
know,

788
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,750
someone just drove along and probably 
was like looking down at a booty call.

789
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,910
Fuck.

790
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,090
Did you see that one there?
Passed out like a month ago.

791
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:56,550
She passed out in the middle of the 
highway and she just fell asleep,

792
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:01,950
like pounding on the window.
And she won't wake up and so he had to,

793
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,010
I think he broke the window or something
like that.

794
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:07,120
I can't remember.
But did she crashed somewhere else?

795
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,130
She just stopped in the middle of the 
highway.

796
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,260
Just took a nap.
Cars were like full St Louis.

797
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,360
She parked.
It is right here to turn up the volume 

798
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,000
on a freeway.
Cars moving behind the wheel of that 

799
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,000
car.
Ten years breaking news track or had the

800
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,730
only camera there is that ran alongside 
the car in the middle five.

801
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Try Breaking that window to get the 
driver to wake up and get her to HP 

802
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,140
officer.
He's risking his life here.

803
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,340
It's on a freeway.
A woman has passed out.

804
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:44,341
I guarantee you somewhere.
A dude that is like I told you.

805
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:52,590
I told you that crazy.
That's why we broke up.

806
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,480
She's pretty cute though.
I'd give her a pass.

807
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,750
That's okay.
Honey.

808
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,940
Off It.
You just need a driver.

809
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,850
I remember I was watching the Uber

810
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,830
Dmz and they're like rockstar crushes in
the non cars in Hollywood hills.

811
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,160
Like,
Hey,

812
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,410
I got to see this.
I'm laughing.

813
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:13,150
And then I knew the guy.
Was it?

814
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,940
It was this Guy Casey from this band a 
man.

815
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,420
They're like a kind of a punk metal 
band,

816
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,660
but he was,
I guess he was drunk and he hit a car 

817
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,871
that he backed up to try to get away and
the front tire came off and he didn't 

818
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:30,480
know she's pressing the gas in the car.
Just drove right into all the other cars

819
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,350
because he had no steering.
Then they added on film.

820
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Oh Man.
It's just unbelievable that you're 

821
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,910
expected to drive two bars and then 
figuring out how to get home.

822
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,970
That's ridiculous.
The fact that everywhere you looked 

823
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,520
there handing out one of the most 
ridiculous drugs,

824
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
it happens to you.
It almost instantly take a shot of Jack 

825
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,850
Daniels within 10 minutes.
You're fucking trash.

826
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,410
How's that bottle of wine legal like 
that's like five glasses of wine.

827
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,520
That's way beyond the legal limit for 
two people in a dinner,

828
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,580
an hour,
and I only had one when they say that.

829
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:14,510
If two people just sitting at a dinner 
table drinking wine and it's a bottle 

830
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,500
and you finish the bottle off your both 
hands.

831
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

832
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,530
You can't drive.
No,

833
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,800
everywhere you look,
people are driving drunk everywhere you 

834
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:22,800
look.
Friday and Saturday night,

835
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,590
you know,
go to a comedy show,

836
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:25,420
any comedy show and those people sit 
there,

837
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:26,410
offered the order,
two,

838
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:31,411
three,
four drinks and then they get out of 

839
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:31,411
there and they drive.

840
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,000
Now it's like for,
for cops must be like the easiest 

841
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,200
pickens ever on Friday and Saturday 
night and ducks and apparently they have

842
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:40,201
those new things that you.
For your iphone now it's like a 

843
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:42,550
breathalyzer for your iphone so you can 
just sit there and just check every,

844
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:45,160
you know,
so it's to be a steering wheel thing.

845
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:47,190
Now there's a new steering wheel they're
developed.

846
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,500
It's going to know if you're drunk.
Well yeah,

847
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:54,510
it was just a CV to fund the story.
It was just great being handed around 

848
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,450
Jesus Today on social media.
So none of us are going to be able to 

849
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,470
drive anywhere,
all be stuck at applebee's.

850
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,340
You know,
it's going to be like,

851
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:05,341
man,
it's going to be like the steroid tests 

852
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:05,341
for the UFC to go,
whoa,

853
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:09,091
hold up.
Everyone's just fucking completely empty

854
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:15,331
because no one's car starts.
They would make that legal limit go up 

855
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:15,331
though if that happens.

856
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:19,740
No,
they were not allowed to have a case of 

857
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:19,740
beer and two shots of.
But no,

858
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,490
they definitely would not.
What they would do is,

859
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:26,510
uh,
everybody would be hiring their little 

860
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:26,830
brothers and sisters to drive them 
around the quiz.

861
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:31,430
On the right side.
Does bigfoot exists now,

862
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,880
but nothing definite.
That's the type of people that are it.

863
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,390
What is that?
Why k y?

864
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:41,990
T O wk knows that mountain news.
Oh my God.

865
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,640
Some poll results.
The snow is 73 percent.

866
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,170
Eight point four percent is not sure.
Not sure.

867
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,700
Are the ones that are tuned into 
survivor man,

868
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,390
book foot right now.
Man,

869
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,150
I don't know.
When they ask less about the footage,

870
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,650
you said no one really knows whether or 
not those boots.

871
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,310
That's enough for me.
That's a no for me.

872
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,080
It looked like a dude in among your 
mask,

873
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:10,090
but I'm telling you what,
I love that big foot thing because just 

874
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,591
seeing the guys that they said,
they're the ones that did that photo in 

875
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:13,591
72 or whatever.

876
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:15,370
Well,
this Patterson Gimlin footage,

877
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:20,371
there's a guy named Bob [inaudible].
He's the guy who wore the big foot 

878
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:24,661
footage.
You can see those videos of him walking 

879
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:27,030
next to the actual footage of bigfoot 
was just like that fucking guy in the 

880
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,180
monkey suit.
Jamie.

881
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,910
Jamie,
what are you doing?

882
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,140
You showed it to her.
She pulled it down.

883
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,020
It won't load.
That's legit.

884
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:35,570
Big Foot.
That is bigfoot's.

885
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,910
Actual foot.
Totally real.

886
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,440
Don't fucking hate bro.
Love.

887
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,510
I love that.
I just thought I grew up in the 

888
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:46,510
seventies.
I love,

889
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:46,510
uh,
that,

890
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,200
that stuff that Leonard Nimoy would do 
like.

891
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,500
Yeah.
Remember he did the Noah's Ark one.

892
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,900
He actually did the full movies.
You could go.

893
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:57,320
I went to the drive and southern Noah's 
arc one and the Ufo one.

894
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,760
Oh,
here it is.

895
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,000
Drunk driving detector.
So how does this work?

896
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,760
According to the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration,

897
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:12,761
approximately 10,000
people are killed by drunk drivers 

898
00:42:12,761 --> 00:42:13,040
annually in the US.
Look at this.

899
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
The long arm of the laws handcuffing 
this young man and taking him to the 

900
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,700
slammer.
Research developing to detection methods

901
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,710
for the driver alcohol detection system.
One method allows the car to analyze a 

902
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,060
driver's exhale,
breath for alcohol content.

903
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,300
See,
that's annoying because I had a friend 

904
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,000
who got a Dui and they made him do that.
Oh,

905
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:39,110
they're gonna have like a that just 
smells your breath.

906
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:44,150
Another method shines and infrared light
into your fingertips and it reads it.

907
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,670
Oh,
it was used.

908
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:51,671
Alcohol limit of ope point zero.
Eight blood alcohol content as it's 

909
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:52,480
standard.
It used to be owed nine right there.

910
00:42:52,481 --> 00:42:55,700
No one was one when I was growing up.
Parents could.

911
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,110
Hmm.
I wonder why they made it my money.

912
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,620
Make money.
If you think that's what it is,

913
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:05,621
or do you think it's because they 
realize that more people are actually 

914
00:43:05,621 --> 00:43:06,260
crashing like that?

915
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:09,940
There must be some scientific basis for 
the one point.

916
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,420
Oh,
eight,

917
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,660
isn't there?
I don't know,

918
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:16,661
but it seems to me that you should be 
able to go in and take a test like a 

919
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:18,800
weed smokers as well and be like,
well,

920
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:22,080
I've been drinking 25 years,
so my limit should be true,

921
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,830
but the problem with that is then you're
going to push it even further.

922
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,760
The guys who go,
look,

923
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:27,290
I looked,
I did the legal limit.

924
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,150
I'd do three shots,
I can handle five,

925
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:34,180
come on and you'll just keep pushing it,
but if you know that if you piss or you 

926
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:36,250
blow and oh eight,
you're fucked you,

927
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,320
then you're not going to get drunk now 
or if you do,

928
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,500
you can't really argue about it.
I used to do these open mics.

929
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:47,501
Joe and this girl had the the 
breathalyzer on her car and she would 

930
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:52,030
pay guys to go out and breathe in or 
ride so she could drive home 

931
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,480
[inaudible].
She would be drunk like where do you do?

932
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,100
And so it looks like it's [inaudible] 
98.

933
00:43:55,101 --> 00:44:00,101
In March of 98,
President Clinton called for the 

934
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:01,850
promotion of a national legal limit 
under which it would be illegal per se,

935
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:06,851
to operate a motor vehicle with a blood 
alcohol concentration of point zero 

936
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:09,680
eight or higher across the country,
including federal property.

937
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,840
He was just trying to get people to not 
pay attention to this extra dirty freak.

938
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,390
That guy,
that guys.

939
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,900
That was the last ones are the ones like
and fucking relate to the real 

940
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:31,481
presidential dick slingers.
I can't wait for him to be back in the 

941
00:44:31,481 --> 00:44:31,481
history.

942
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,140
Oh yeah,
100 percent.

943
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,290
I don't think so.
They did some polls,

944
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,660
man.
After the emails and stuff,

945
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,150
people are just like,
they're looking.

946
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,220
First of all,
people were looking for a reason to not 

947
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,621
like her because she's a woman.
Let's just get that out of the way and 

948
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:51,920
the fact that she's a woman that's also 
a Clinton and it's a Clinton versus a 

949
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,160
bush.
People are fucking totally tired of this

950
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:58,161
dynasty thing that's been going on for 
the past x amount of decades where they 

951
00:44:58,161 --> 00:45:00,210
just going back and forth,
Bush to Bush to Bush.

952
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,480
I mean the idea of a Jeb Bush became 
president after his brother fucked 

953
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,231
everything up and then his dad fucked 
everything up before that and if that's 

954
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:11,280
not our option,
then the Clinton option and it's Hillary

955
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,840
and Hillary.
Hillary is.

956
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,160
She's tied to a bunch of shady fucking 
things.

957
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,650
That property stuff.
Yeah,

958
00:45:17,651 --> 00:45:22,240
the Whitewater Shane from back in that 
thing that it's Arkansas,

959
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,460
the Vince foster thing.

960
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:28,460
There's a lot of like weird shit,
but that's the case with anybody that's 

961
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,040
involved in like high level politics 
like that.

962
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:29,820
There's,
there's.

963
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,730
They got some shit on you before you 
ever even get in there.

964
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:36,900
Otherwise you don't get in there.
You can't be a politician to be clean.

965
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,430
That's impossible.
There's no way.

966
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,200
You literally can't get to the highest 
level where you're running for president

967
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:46,050
unless you've been completely 
compromised by special interest groups.

968
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,380
That's the only way those cancer 
campaign contributions are critical and 

969
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,011
you have to sit down with those fucking 
corporation owners and the CEOS and 

970
00:45:55,011 --> 00:45:59,331
they.
They figure out what the fuck is going 

971
00:45:59,331 --> 00:45:59,331
to go down,
like how,

972
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:02,700
how laws are going to be structured,
what influence is going to get them.

973
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:05,160
If this person gets into our office,
they don't.

974
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:10,190
They're not ambiguous about it.
Now like maybe I can help you if I get 

975
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:13,341
in,
give me a million bucks and went back 

976
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:13,341
and help you.

977
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:15,710
They know that this guy is going to make
either regulations more relaxed or 

978
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:20,421
figuring out how to push things through 
or figure out that that's what politics 

979
00:46:20,421 --> 00:46:20,700
are.
It's all money now,

980
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,040
it's the whole ball of wax when they 
talk about like the amount of time that 

981
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,661
a guy actually spends campaigning and 
trying to raise money,

982
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,080
like as opposed to how much time they 
spend on actual work.

983
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,550
It's.
It's astounding.

984
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:41,390
Campaign is all about raising money.
I take their whole thing is about 

985
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:41,820
raising money and occasionally giving 
speeches.

986
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,930
That's crazy,
right?

987
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,720
It's just whoever gets the most money 
wins,

988
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:51,260
Donnelly.
That you would have to have some insane 

989
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,950
amount of money spent just to try to 
make it into those debates.

990
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,400
Just to try to get into the baits.
Like the commission for presidential 

991
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,460
debates is a privately owned 
corporation,

992
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:04,560
are privately owned institution.
Like you can't just get in the debate.

993
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:05,310
You can't say,
Hey,

994
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:10,311
I'm Dean del Rey and I've got some 
pretty good ideas and I'd like to run 

995
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:10,311
for president.
No,

996
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:13,970
you have to.
You have to get more than I believe 15 

997
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,001
percent on five different polls and it's
the polls that day choose like they can.

998
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,940
They can cherry pick.
Like say if you're a guy like Ross Perot

999
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:22,680
type guy that might fuck things up for 
them.

1000
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:28,250
They didn't anticipate that when Ross 
Perot came around and he spent a 

1001
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,010
shitload of his own money,
tried to run for president,

1002
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,390
ruined all their plans

1003
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,360
right away.
Afterwards they monkeyed with the 

1004
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,761
numbers and change things.
It made it even more difficult for an 

1005
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:39,880
independent person to debate and the 
presidential elections.

1006
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,490
So to the average American,
there's only two choices.

1007
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:45,100
You see those two assholes on,
on television.

1008
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,250
You have your Republican debates and you
have your democratic debates,

1009
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:51,190
and then when it breaks down to those 
two guys,

1010
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,650
those are the only two people running 
for president as far as you know,

1011
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,740
that's.
That's a broken system.

1012
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,020
Like I'm 49.
How old are you?

1013
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,120
40 seven.
I'll be 48 in August.

1014
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,420
Do you remember a good president?
Yeah,

1015
00:48:04,421 --> 00:48:07,390
will clam was good.
People liked Clinton until he got caught

1016
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,520
getting a blowjob.
Carter Carter man,

1017
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:14,460
Carter Sweetie.
He smoked weed with what?

1018
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,000
Elvis on the roof.
That's cool.

1019
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,160
Did he had the White House?
That's what they say.

1020
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,240
Know?
I never heard that.

1021
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,800
It's one of those fucking a rainbow bar 
and grill.

1022
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,810
Family stories.
No,

1023
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,430
I think it was like in an elvis song 
from motorhead.

1024
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,260
Tell you ever played a spaghetti.
One time I met Elvis.

1025
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:37,580
He smoke weed with Jimmy Dean.
Was it you that told me that?

1026
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:42,610
That,
that classic Ron Jeremy Story about the 

1027
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,170
rainbow and he is sleeping now.
Nevermind.

1028
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:49,850
Supposedly he had.
He's a narcoleptic or he just finds 

1029
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:52,000
Jeremy Ron,
Jeremy Sleep all the time and supposedly

1030
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:55,760
he was at the rainbow and I forget who 
told me this story.

1031
00:48:55,761 --> 00:49:00,761
He says they looked over and ron just 
went spaghetti and fell asleep and 

1032
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:06,260
getting the night somebody put him up 
and he had like spaghetti all over him 

1033
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:06,430
and stuff.
But here it is.

1034
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,800
Oh Willie.
Oh,

1035
00:49:08,801 --> 00:49:13,801
Willie Nelson and chip Carter.
Chip car smoked a joint together on the 

1036
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:13,801
White House.
Oh,

1037
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:15,130
sees.
See how the story changes harder though.

1038
00:49:15,131 --> 00:49:20,131
Let's tell the stories.
That's how that game of telephone grid 

1039
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:20,350
telephone works.

1040
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,080
It was like shipped Carter's Jimmy 
Carter's son.

1041
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:24,610
Is that what it is?
It must be right.

1042
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,520
That's not the one that shipped Carter 
running.

1043
00:49:27,521 --> 00:49:29,960
What's he doing,
man?

1044
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:35,410
Because his brother had belly beer.
Billy Carter was a mess and Clinton have

1045
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:38,440
a fucking mess of a brother too.
I don't remember the mess of a brother.

1046
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,600
Kai.
That's great.

1047
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,670
Yeah.
The mess,

1048
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,830
brother.
That almost ruins it for everybody.

1049
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,980
Smoked any of the Willie weed.
He's got his own weed.

1050
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,880
No,
no.

1051
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,830
Everyone has.
Everyone has a skin diamond.

1052
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:55,831
Has her own leader.
Just like four different strains named 

1053
00:49:55,831 --> 00:49:56,260
after me.
I had one of them.

1054
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:58,140
Yeah.
This.

1055
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,510
You can't look whatever the Willie 
Nelson weed is.

1056
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:02,650
He probably has nothing to do with it.
Yeah,

1057
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,420
right.
It's just they're paying him.

1058
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:08,110
Jimmy Carter was one of the guys that I 
was.

1059
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,430
I remember being young and listening to 
them talk and I believed him.

1060
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:15,490
She was sincere in a way that a lot of 
these guys just don't.

1061
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,860
Some guys just.
They seemed so phony.

1062
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,160
Carter,
whether or not you agree with them or 

1063
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,781
disagree with him.
He seemed sincere and then it always 

1064
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:28,621
bugged me that the Republicans had 
negotiated to release the hostages in 

1065
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:33,170
Iran after Reagan was in office,
so they had.

1066
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:38,410
They had made it a part of the 
negotiation to not release those people 

1067
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,350
to make them look.
I can hear right,

1068
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:44,380
but that that means that those people 
had to stay prisoner longer just for 

1069
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:46,190
politics.
Yeah.

1070
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,730
I mean the Republicans at the time 
should have been shunned just for that.

1071
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,100
Someone should have pointed that out.
If they could prove it,

1072
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,360
that's if that was true.
I don't know if that is true though.

1073
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,960
That might be one of those sessions.
Be Carter on the roof with Elvis.

1074
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,040
Carolyn with Andrew.
It's actually Maroon five doing when you

1075
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:11,450
remember those gas wars.
Joe Green Day with the odd and even 

1076
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,590
plates.
You could only buy gas every other day.

1077
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,430
Whatever your last number on your 
license plate was because the kids don't

1078
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,550
remember that.
That was crazy out here.

1079
00:51:19,551 --> 00:51:20,330
Are We?
Oh yeah.

1080
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:21,890
Where'd you grow up?
I was the east coast.

1081
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,240
It was in California.
I didn't even play.

1082
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,580
I thought it was across the nation,
but you could only buy gas on every 

1083
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,740
other day if whatever your last number 
on your license plate was.

1084
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,190
Task Wars.
It makes no sense at all.

1085
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:40,730
What if you just happen to run out of 
gas so you couldn't do anything?

1086
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,080
Well,
it was during that whole.

1087
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:47,190
Well,
that was the one who started making 

1088
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,371
those really economical car.
So it was when they were trying to 

1089
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,010
figure out the Saudi oil situation.

1090
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,410
Yeah,
they were trying.

1091
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,830
That's when cars turned to shit.
Exactly.

1092
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:56,480
When cars went from being these awesome 
beasts to these dog shit.

1093
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,090
Cars.
Dog should car the seventies,

1094
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:04,091
the sixties,
sixties or seventies is the worst 

1095
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:04,091
dropoff of,
of American cars ever.

1096
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:06,370
It took us until like the 2004 we 
recovered.

1097
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

1098
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:09,650
Like remember the Mustang to.
Oh,

1099
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,920
piece of shit.
All those mustangs in the late seventies

1100
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:17,921
into the eighties mustang with ugly 
plastic nonsense.

1101
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,990
You go back to [inaudible] 69,
mach one.

1102
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,020
Just look at one of those and then look 
at what happened in the eighties.

1103
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:26,460
Like how did you guys fall so far off?
I.

1104
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,790
How did you do this?
Isn't that crazy?

1105
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,860
Because that was mock ones are 
beautiful.

1106
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:34,130
All those old cars to this day.
To this day,

1107
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,630
I mean,
it might not be the most arrogant.

1108
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:41,260
They might not be the best as far as 
like the wind resistance and all that 

1109
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,520
shit,
but as far as like the looks.

1110
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,560
Oh,
I had a dodge super B,

1111
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:50,561
70.
It was a great car selling it right now 

1112
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:50,600
for my buddy.
I sold it to him 13 years ago.

1113
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:54,530
Now he's selling it.
He's had it forever but is a listing for

1114
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:55,730
it.
We'll get it sold right now.

1115
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,660
Oh yes.
Listed.

1116
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,060
Just email me.
Dean del Ray.

1117
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,980
Don't say a fucking tsunami warning 
email.

1118
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,270
You almost did it.
Released your email address.

1119
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,730
I think there's a picture of it on my 
instagram now.

1120
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:21,731
It says B,
five blue and it's got the c stripe and 

1121
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,950
the crazy and it's just when you look at
those cars and think that you could walk

1122
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,100
a car lot and 70 now I go,
let me get that race car.

1123
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,410
Well that's what they're doing today.
They are.

1124
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,870
I love the hell cat to all these cars 
today.

1125
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,880
They're way better.
This is the first time where the new 

1126
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:38,880
American cars,
like the DOJ,

1127
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,020
they drive is so much better than the 
old ones,

1128
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,480
but still the old ones,
they still look better.

1129
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:48,170
Better.
There's something about them like a 69 

1130
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:48,170
Camaro.
There's something about.

1131
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:48,170
It was just like you can't.
He can't beat it.

1132
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:50,520
They got that,
has that classic muscle car,

1133
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:53,100
loved that car with the hideaway 
headlights.

1134
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:58,370
The four on the floor.
He had the tick tock gauges and the 

1135
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:58,580
wooden dash and wood steering wheel.
Right.

1136
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,980
And the console.
I had to have a man at the console and 

1137
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:08,850
eight track player man.
Those cars,

1138
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,420
they just nailed it.
They nailed it for between 65 and it's 

1139
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,050
tough to go after [inaudible] 73 now.
Seventy three Kudos are still bad ass at

1140
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:23,120
73.
I think they still made a challenger in 

1141
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:23,120
73,
but everything else,

1142
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:23,120
dog shit.
That was the end.

1143
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,200
And the cars had already lost their 
power.

1144
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,450
They were already like butchering the 
power on them yet,

1145
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,970
but seventies cause the last hurrah.
Seventy,

1146
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,460
71 car.
I love the 69.

1147
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,480
Super B with the a 4:46
pack and the pistol grip shifter,

1148
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:41,570
you know?
Yeah.

1149
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,820
By the time 70 rolled around,
Mustang had already taken a downturn.

1150
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:49,850
It's true.
They're just started to look weird and 

1151
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:49,850
then.
But the but the but,

1152
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:54,660
but by the time 70 rolled around the,
the Kuda was just getting started as 

1153
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,200
kills the Kuda suck before 70.
Sure.

1154
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,310
I had the coo to the first one where it 
was and it was shorter and funky.

1155
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,520
Then they dumped the era and make it 
longer or they make a big body and it's 

1156
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,670
killer,
but they only nailed it for three years.

1157
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:10,050
Can you imagine that?
They wouldn't.

1158
00:55:10,051 --> 00:55:13,050
Seventy two,
73 and then everything after that,

1159
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,880
it's gone.
It's true.

1160
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,060
Barracuda had it.
So that was the last spark of the muscle

1161
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:20,010
car.
That was the last remaining era.

1162
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,040
And now sometimes you'll see one go for 
a million bucks,

1163
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,930
like Cuda convertible.

1164
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,410
Purple made three.
$1,000,000

1165
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,180
more an hour.
Now Barry Jackson more.

1166
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,650
Now they're going for more.
I know private collections that uh,

1167
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,660
they sell.
They have like this rk motors in 

1168
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:41,091
Charlotte,
they have this big website filled with 

1169
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:41,091
them and they had one on sale for more 
than a million bucks.

1170
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:42,870
It's crazy numbers matching ones.
Yeah.

1171
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,140
I love that shit man.
I'll talk to for hours on cars were the 

1172
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,030
nuts man and I just like this one,
you know,

1173
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,000
and I'll send them a photo in the middle
of the night.

1174
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:52,950
He'll be like,
Nah,

1175
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:57,951
this one.
Well Corvette had some good years after 

1176
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,940
[inaudible] 69.
They had the 70 vet was still in those.

1177
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:04,950
Those sting raises to a pretty bad car.
Seventy three is the last year and that 

1178
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,690
once they get rid of that steel bumper,
it's out.

1179
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,120
You know that same thing.
Yeah.

1180
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:12,630
Seventy three was the last acceptable 
year for a muscle car.

1181
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,710
Yeah.
Weird.

1182
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:18,770
It is weird.
He tried to sell someone a 75 muscle 

1183
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:18,770
card.
Good luck.

1184
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,220
I'll tell you what,
I do have jail shit away from me.

1185
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,010
Nobody wants it.
I loved the 78 Trans six point

1186
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,290
six.
The Burmese.

1187
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,500
That's a true.
That's true.

1188
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,560
That's true.
That's the only car though in the 

1189
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,631
seventies.
The Burt Reynolds is that website I 

1190
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:33,631
bought.
This is where I'm.

1191
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:33,880
I bought my corvette.
Oh my God.

1192
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:35,140
Look at that.
Sixty eight.

1193
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:38,110
Fort Shelby right there.
The Lord.

1194
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,210
What are there?
You got 69 in the middle.

1195
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:43,150
They're black like in that one there.
One hundred 9,000.

1196
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:48,930
See,
I like my car stock that I don't like 

1197
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,430
when they're all phased out.
I don't dare you get a new car for that.

1198
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:53,170
Those stock ones drive like shit though.
I know,

1199
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:55,990
but you just have it for the burger that
for 2017.

1200
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,270
That's what it see where it says pro 
touring.

1201
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:03,630
Those pro touring cars with.
That means they take an old muscle car 

1202
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:04,900
and they put the most modern suspension 
on it.

1203
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,670
Like chip foose,
red handle.

1204
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,330
We'll chip is more of a designer and you
know,

1205
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:14,370
chip does a lot of different 
modifications to cars to make them look 

1206
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:14,370
cool.
Look at that.

1207
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,030
70 Chevelle super sport.

1208
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,220
Convertible debt.
Get Cocker,

1209
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:25,250
scrolled down.
This 70 Chevelle convertible more.

1210
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:30,620
That makes my dick look at that.
Look at that fucking car and the 

1211
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,850
restart.
Oh my God.

1212
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,290
Look it.
Eight hood.

1213
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:37,840
That's my favorite hood.
That fucking car.

1214
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,970
Can we see the interior?
Like lease console?

1215
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:43,570
That's like a perfect combination to 
have the wheels.

1216
00:57:43,571 --> 00:57:45,700
The wheels are like they're modern 
wheels.

1217
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:49,660
A vintage Erin.
The radio is dope.

1218
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:52,750
Like at the top aunt.
Then I look at that top.

1219
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,560
Will leak after data away.
He stayed down.

1220
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,110
No,
no,

1221
00:57:56,111 --> 00:58:01,111
it won't leak because these are all new 
that everything's new and used cars.

1222
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,130
Wow.
Look at that.

1223
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,400
God.
The console with the forest speed.

1224
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,430
Unbelievable.
One hundred 49.

1225
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,640
That's the fucking car right there.
Look at that car.

1226
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:15,150
Just gives you a man bone.
Gives me a boner for that.

1227
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,530
Even for sex though.
No,

1228
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:18,220
no,
I got.

1229
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,690
So you just want to try.
Just drive around hard trunk.

1230
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:28,080
This was the last uh,
last couple of years of the Chevelle to 

1231
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,410
let's just Chavela was bad ass and 67 
and 68.

1232
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,920
I just wonder what the carbon fibers 
valve covers.

1233
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:34,800
See that?
Holy Shit.

1234
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,070
That's a pro.
Yeah,

1235
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:41,071
it's an ls three.
That's a six point two Liter v eight 

1236
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:41,071
from a corvette.
Oh,

1237
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,320
Joe.
Is it hard not to just buy every single 

1238
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:46,320
car?

1239
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,470
Yeah,
you gotta you gotta be an adult.

1240
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:52,770
You pulled out into the store with that.
I would just fuck it if you see my 

1241
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:52,770
corvette.
No,

1242
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,610
my Corbett's coulier Oh,
what year?

1243
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:59,290
60 five.
60 five pro touring convertible.

1244
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:02,760
The entire suspensions redone.
Fully independent function.

1245
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,540
Silver,
silver.

1246
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,970
But I uh,
sent it down to Steve Strope.

1247
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,810
Steve Strope is this a hot rod builder 
in California?

1248
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:15,811
And I had them change some things on it 
and approve the suspension.

1249
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,250
That's the kind like that one right 
there.

1250
00:59:18,251 --> 00:59:20,110
The 64.
Exactly.

1251
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:25,111
Like mine.
Oh my dad had 65 solid it when I was 

1252
00:59:25,111 --> 00:59:25,111
born in [inaudible].
60 six.

1253
00:59:25,111 --> 00:59:29,770
I got a photo of it.
Him and my mom in front of it to the 

1254
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:29,770
best.
I'll send you the photo and you can look

1255
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,100
at is cool.
I'll show.

1256
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,900
I'll bring that car to the store when 
it's finished.

1257
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:33,980
It's almost done now.

1258
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,770
I love those.
They were called the black widow.

1259
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:38,930
The one on the left.
The 64 with the.

1260
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:39,740
Yeah,
there.

1261
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,180
Go to that one.
I love that.

1262
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:46,750
I love that car.
There's such radical designs or 

1263
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,820
corvette.
God,

1264
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:50,660
what a car.
I'll come.

1265
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,970
They didn't do that at all.
They do sort of.

1266
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:57,200
Dude pulled up the 2015 corvette Z.
Oh,

1267
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,550
love it.
Check this out because this right now is

1268
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:06,590
a new car the corvette has created.
That is as fast as a lot of cars that 

1269
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,280
cost a million bucks.
Oh yeah.

1270
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,440
This is an insane car.
I mean,

1271
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:15,550
you'd probably have to spend a million 
bucks to beat it at this.

1272
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,530
Go to the blue.
That's the beef.

1273
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,680
I love the next one over right there.
The light bulb got you.

1274
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,550
Don't like that.
Start drinking again.

1275
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:31,040
Know it's pretty dope.
The actual car itself and the little 

1276
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,040
swatch looks gross.

1277
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,340
Yeah,
yeah,

1278
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:31,950
right.
Oh yeah.

1279
01:00:31,951 --> 01:00:36,951
Thomas.
But pull up a video of one of these 

1280
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:39,290
because once you see it in action,
that's where it's ridiculous that this 

1281
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:42,230
is a 600 horsepower race car that you 
can buy straight from the factory.

1282
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,590
It's less than $80,000.
Yeah,

1283
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:50,650
I mean you can get one stripped out for 
like 80 grand and it'll burry like most 

1284
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:54,230
really high end sports cars.
It's insane.

1285
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:55,720
The,
the.

1286
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,350
This is the,
this is the race version.

1287
01:00:57,351 --> 01:01:00,830
You're looking at Jamie,
this is the development of the race,

1288
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:03,710
the actual race version,
a youtube video,

1289
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,480
and you can see a guy.
He's racing one on the garage.

1290
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:09,560
Go to jail.
Was Raj?

1291
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,780
Yup.
There you go.

1292
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:12,370
Right there.
Oh,

1293
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,300
because it'll get us band.
Okay.

1294
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:16,820
We'll just watch it without showing it 
to the rest of the world.

1295
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,770
But these a liquid.

1296
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,240
Well they.
This is the problem with this car though

1297
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:28,270
that bums me out,
is that they're making this thing with 

1298
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:29,130
an automatic.
The old zero six in the car.

1299
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,430
One.
The only way you could get it was it had

1300
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:33,640
to be a stick shift.
I left the car.

1301
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:38,670
One fucking man.
Remember that one day maybe shifting or 

1302
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,410
even a woman.
A woman is exciting.

1303
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,340
They made one like five years ago,
[inaudible].

1304
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:47,270
It was blue with the glass top and they 
only made like 50 of them and that thing

1305
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:49,320
was insane.
It was like no,

1306
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:52,130
been around for a long time.
They've made it for a long time,

1307
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:57,131
but it was only available in a stick.
J Dot Lana would never buy it in 

1308
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:58,040
anything other than a stick because he's
a fucking man.

1309
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,300
Yeah.
He wears jeans.

1310
01:01:59,301 --> 01:02:02,570
Shirts 2015.
Look at him,

1311
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,770
look at the APP right there.

1312
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,760
He's got a one style of shirt that he 
allows himself.

1313
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:11,440
Hey guys,
let's,

1314
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:13,820
uh,
don't get it twisted.

1315
01:02:13,821 --> 01:02:18,821
I don't give a fuck if I get like the 
guys feel comfortable.

1316
01:02:19,261 --> 01:02:21,300
My sleeves are rolled up because I work 
hard at the,

1317
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,070
at the garage.
Do you know it's.

1318
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,880
Once he stopped,
stopped TV.

1319
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:29,900
He got rid of that black dot that was in
the middle of his head that he started 

1320
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,520
freaking out and he wasn't totally great
time.

1321
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,800
Got Older,
but yeah,

1322
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:36,060
I'm,
I'm doing his show.

1323
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,170
His show was supposed to have already 
happened,

1324
01:02:39,171 --> 01:02:40,320
but that dude rear ended me.

1325
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:44,210
He's got a Joe.
He's got a 36 knucklehead,

1326
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,660
which is considered the best harley of 
all time.

1327
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,860
I watched the footage of him last week 
driving it a riding.

1328
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:55,310
It all originally never restored it.
He found in a barn.

1329
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:58,370
Didn't start it for like 20 years and 
decided,

1330
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,900
well,
let's try that thing out.

1331
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:03,740
And he started up and took her for a 
ride and I lose my mind when I see it.

1332
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:06,950
30 six knuckle.
It's a one year motorcycle.

1333
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:12,010
Wow.
And he has it a CV looking at real 

1334
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:12,010
quick.
Hold on a second

1335
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:17,310
while we're still on it.
This car is the 1965.

1336
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:19,260
And while we're on this video,
before we change,

1337
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:23,320
this is the 1965 of 2015.
I mean this car when,

1338
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:28,370
when all said and done and people look 
back and like the golden era of muscle 

1339
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:31,140
cars,
they came back in a big way like the new

1340
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,330
mustangs have.
You've seen the new shelby?

1341
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:35,650
The 2015.
I love shelby.

1342
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,200
Three-Fifty.
The GT three slash 50.

1343
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,720
It's insane.
So beautiful car.

1344
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,760
They were,
they were doing the sound of it 

1345
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:44,760
yesterday on Yahoo.
They said it was the best uh,

1346
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,280
exhaust note ever done.
And you listen to it.

1347
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,210
It needs to go listen to this car.

1348
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,650
Let's pull that up.
Shelby gt three slash 15 slash 2015.

1349
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,810
It's incredible.
Have 16 because it's not,

1350
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,000
it's not released.
It's not yet.

1351
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,950
Yeah.
Have you seen the 2015 sienna,

1352
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,070
Toyota,
Sienna?

1353
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:01,740
No.
Pull up the exhausts.

1354
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,570
Just heard.
It's.

1355
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:03,990
Yeah,

1356
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,010
it's good.
They call it the greatest.

1357
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:11,850
Wouldn't be November 17th because he 
said it just came out and that was 

1358
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:11,850
yesterday.
I'm like,

1359
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:11,850
yeah,
no.

1360
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:14,990
Yeah,
try Yahoo.

1361
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,640
Is that it?
Noise regulations in America since for 

1362
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,580
was not able to make the gt through 
screaming at the top of that.

1363
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:27,810
We'll try that.
Yeah.

1364
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,570
Let's take out.
What does that say exhausts us?

1365
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,190
Nodes.
You can change it.

1366
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:33,860
That they,
uh,

1367
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:36,440
the set here.
Let's hear.

1368
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:36,830
Yeah.

1369
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:43,120
It was such losers.
Yeah.

1370
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:57,670
That sounds like a drag when you open up
the scanner.

1371
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:09,650
Wow.
That's a muscle man.

1372
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:22,180
That's one of the greatest sounds of 
muscle cars ever made.

1373
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:28,140
Women.
That's a god Damn Dragon.

1374
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:30,700
It's a dragon.

1375
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:33,360
It's glorious.
Oh my God.

1376
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,010
Gloria sounds.
Don't get better than that.

1377
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,200
It's so great,
man.

1378
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:42,201
That's rock and roll and I'm pretty sure
they only make that one in a stick 

1379
01:05:42,201 --> 01:05:42,201
shift.
Praise Allah.

1380
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,490
Praise.
Praise store.

1381
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:49,350
She can't be making that fucking thing 
in an automatic to stop.

1382
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:54,380
Learn how to drive a stick.
You don't appreciate what the fuck 

1383
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,830
you're doing.
La Mans Talk.

1384
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,710
It is this tall.
I've never driven a stick.

1385
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:02,790
It's not as fun.
In bumper to bumper traffic,

1386
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,130
bumper to bumper traffic sucks.
No matter what you do.

1387
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:10,460
If you only gonna have one car that you 
drive around and you want total 

1388
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:10,460
convenience.
Yes,

1389
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,640
automatic.
But if you want to be a fucking man,

1390
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:18,350
okay,
you gave yourself a goddamn stick shift 

1391
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,241
and you deal with it.
You deal with that bumper to bumper in 

1392
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:20,241
San Fran,
man,

1393
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:22,470
for you.
Just hills on the hills.

1394
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:26,040
He is learned.
Steve Mcqueen a few times,

1395
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:28,860
just drunk jumping hills.
Hey,

1396
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:32,970
I was in echo park last week.
They got hills over there.

1397
01:06:32,971 --> 01:06:37,971
I've never been three streets.
They say are the tallest hills in 

1398
01:06:37,971 --> 01:06:38,970
California above San Fran.
Really?

1399
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,620
You can't even see down.
I was like,

1400
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,810
Holy Shit.
I was on my bike.

1401
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,690
I was like,
this is scary as shit in echo park,

1402
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:48,240
three hills.
I've never been there ever.

1403
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:53,690
I just.
I always find it hilarious when you see 

1404
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:56,181
those houses in San Francisco that 
literally have to be smushed up next to 

1405
01:06:56,181 --> 01:07:00,351
each other because they're both leaning 
sideways on this fucking hill trying to 

1406
01:07:00,351 --> 01:07:04,041
stay straight,
connected each other and like the hill 

1407
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:06,120
is,
and then the bottom of the houses,

1408
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:11,121
it's like a triangle to wedge it in as 
like when you look at the actual frame 

1409
01:07:11,121 --> 01:07:14,670
of the house and the way the foundation 
is wedged into the hill,

1410
01:07:14,671 --> 01:07:15,900
you'll like,
this is ridiculous.

1411
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:20,900
Can you imagine building those crazy 
like no one's going to buy these and 

1412
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:25,221
they all sell.
And then the other problem is if one of 

1413
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:25,221
them catches on fire,
done,

1414
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:28,140
it goes right through all the houses 
because these fucking assholes are glued

1415
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:29,220
next to each other.
Yeah,

1416
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,990
absolutely.
Have fires,

1417
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,970
man.
San Francisco has some bad fires.

1418
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:35,820
They got a history of it.
I mean that 89 earthquake,

1419
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:36,860
the entire,
uh,

1420
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:39,420
marina burned down to the ground because
that's,

1421
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:41,520
uh,
was built on landfill sand.

1422
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:46,940
And then the shit start,
the earth moved and the house is sunk 

1423
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:51,251
and the gas lines cracked.
And the whole thing went up in flames 

1424
01:07:51,251 --> 01:07:52,960
that took like a day to just put out the
fire.

1425
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,020
So that whole place was burning to the 
ground.

1426
01:07:55,021 --> 01:07:56,580
Eighty nine.
Imagine what that looked like.

1427
01:07:56,810 --> 01:08:01,810
A forced CNN.
Imagine whole cnn back then they did on 

1428
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:05,790
the bay bridge over and over when it 
drops down.

1429
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:06,840
And the car falls.
Yeah.

1430
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,750
Yeah.
I watched that live from,

1431
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:11,340
from Boston.
That's where I was like,

1432
01:08:11,341 --> 01:08:14,520
Fuck California before I moved here.

1433
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,260
It felt like an actual.
It wasn't a quake where you're like,

1434
01:08:20,261 --> 01:08:22,630
Whoa,
this is a big one.

1435
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,520
It was more like waves.
So I can.

1436
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:29,260
I was watching the 89 world series.
It was giants a's.

1437
01:08:29,261 --> 01:08:30,720
First time ever.
You're like,

1438
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:34,330
this could be great.
Bay Bay Bridge World series.

1439
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:38,510
And I come out in the living room and 
the fucking four's going like this,

1440
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:39,760
like Whoa,
what?

1441
01:08:39,761 --> 01:08:41,500
And then you realize what's going on.
I'm

1442
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,280
scared.
Me Too.

1443
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,940
That shit is real right there.
Look at that right there.

1444
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:54,570
And then they other mad drove off.
So the lady drove off the top of it.

1445
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,150
Yeah,
she was on the top.

1446
01:08:56,151 --> 01:08:58,490
And then the thing dropped and she went 
down.

1447
01:08:58,491 --> 01:09:00,920
I think the other piece crunch people 
below,

1448
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,870
you know,
a credit spread or you know,

1449
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,220
somewhere someone skimped on some 
construction costs.

1450
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,690
All that is gone now,
right?

1451
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,440
No.
The down part is.

1452
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,520
That's the first part.
Oh no,

1453
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:16,500
that's gone.
Yeah,

1454
01:09:16,501 --> 01:09:19,070
that's gone.
The first part says suspended bridge and

1455
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:20,320
the new part,
the new parts.

1456
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,490
Cool.
You seen it show the new bridge?

1457
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,120
No,
I don't think so.

1458
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:27,950
It's an intention.
It's like Super Art Deco.

1459
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,210
When I lived in San Francisco,
I lived there from age seven to 11.

1460
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:37,211
I experienced the tiniest little baby 
earthquake were the windows rattled and 

1461
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:38,060
I freaked out because it was a little 
kid.

1462
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:40,830
He was there as a kid from seven to 11.
Oh,

1463
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,370
that's right.
What were your parents down there?

1464
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:48,490
My Dad was.
My stepdad when I was a kid was a 

1465
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:49,520
computer programmer and then you want to
be an architect.

1466
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:54,230
So we moved from New Jersey to 
California and lived in San Francisco.

1467
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,850
Wow.
For those five years.

1468
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,250
And um,
when,

1469
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:03,251
uh,
when I was here I was always scared of 

1470
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:03,251
it.
But that one little one,

1471
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:06,941
it was just a little baby one just north
of route on the windows and I remember 

1472
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:06,941
like,
Whoa,

1473
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:10,390
just this feeling of helplessness and 
weirdness and then I didn't experience 

1474
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:14,441
an actual one and even that was a baby 
one until 94.

1475
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:19,220
I was here after the big earthquake and 
experienced some aftershocks where I was

1476
01:10:19,221 --> 01:10:20,870
in a shitty apartment in north 
Hollywood.

1477
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,820
And I remember the feeling that,
you know,

1478
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:26,240
those refrigerator boxes,
like someone will buy a refrigerator and

1479
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:27,900
then the kids would play in the box and 
so on.

1480
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:30,010
But you know how the box like it would.
Oh yeah,

1481
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,930
it would just move like really weekly.
You could push it back and forth.

1482
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:35,720
That's what the department felt like.
It felt like a refrigerator box.

1483
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:40,721
I was like,
this is crazy because I was in north 

1484
01:10:40,721 --> 01:10:40,721
Hollywood,
which isn't too far from North Ridge.

1485
01:10:40,721 --> 01:10:41,510
That was the epicenter,
right?

1486
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,610
Yeah.
And uh,

1487
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:47,630
this shitty apartment that I was in was 
just made out a fucking hopes and dreams

1488
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:52,680
and sliding back and forth.
And then I've experienced a couple that 

1489
01:10:53,391 --> 01:10:55,200
are similar to that,
like five and a half,

1490
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:57,050
five point four years,
something like that.

1491
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:02,410
But I've never experienced a real one.
The real ones are supposed to be life 

1492
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:02,870
changing.
Do you see that movie yet?

1493
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,090
I saw it.
I love the Rock,

1494
01:11:05,091 --> 01:11:10,091
but I'm not going to go.
Life is precious that they're trying to 

1495
01:11:10,091 --> 01:11:11,540
limit my movie.
Going to movies that don't suck.

1496
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:14,470
That's not taking over yesterday's.
Would you say that

1497
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:18,030
the one about Brian Wilson,
that beach boys one.

1498
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:18,990
What is it?
What's it called?

1499
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,380
It's called love and mercy.
And it's a,

1500
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:26,420
the kid from the um,
there will be blood and little Miss 

1501
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,750
Sunshine.
The guy that didn't talk on that movie,

1502
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:33,140
he plays Brian Wilson and it's about the
era of a smile and pet sounds.

1503
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:38,970
It's so cool.
Smile and pet care to pet sounds was the

1504
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,940
record that the Beatles said,
oh my God,

1505
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:44,550
we've got to make sergeant peppers will.
Yeah.

1506
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:47,670
Because it was like,
it was a one man genius.

1507
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:51,120
Basically heard all these sounds and his
fucking head and made this record.

1508
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:56,121
Pet sounds.
And a beach boys record after they're 

1509
01:11:56,121 --> 01:11:56,121
like,
oh,

1510
01:11:56,121 --> 01:11:59,511
we're so they get into this like dark 
crazy record one guy.

1511
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,840
Yeah.
I never knew that they need a guy,

1512
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,550
Brian Wilson.
He goes his vision.

1513
01:12:05,551 --> 01:12:10,551
Yeah.
And the other guys were out on tour and 

1514
01:12:10,551 --> 01:12:11,250
he is like,
you guys gone on tour and I'll just make

1515
01:12:11,251 --> 01:12:13,260
a record when you come back,
you'll sing on it.

1516
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:18,261
And he just made this fucking like 
legendary record of layered sounds and 

1517
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:21,480
instruments and,
and uh,

1518
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,020
insane.
It's really insane.

1519
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:26,040
What should we listen to?
Like what song?

1520
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,920
Oh,
let me see the track listing rally.

1521
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:30,420
Um,
it's,

1522
01:12:30,421 --> 01:12:35,421
you know that.
Oh God only knows right there.

1523
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:39,720
That's the one right there.
That's really the one they,

1524
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:40,530
they,
uh,

1525
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:44,500
is that right there?
That's.

1526
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,590
God only knows.
Yeah.

1527
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,180
So you can see where beetles get started
to pepperdine.

1528
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,650
Wow.
This is the beach boys.

1529
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:54,160
It's arguably one of the top five albums
of all time.

1530
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:59,360
He took acid and,
and he starts taking acid.

1531
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,750
Why have I never heard of this?
It's incredible Jeff.

1532
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,680
That's cool.
It's so weird.

1533
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:15,420
Yeah.
You might not like with either.

1534
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:18,600
Probably not going to like this.
Let's.

1535
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,090
Anyway,
those guys gave me a copy of the jets.

1536
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:22,470
Great.

1537
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:23,910
60 six.
Huh?

1538
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,180
Give me a copy.
What do you live in the eighties?

1539
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:32,750
How are you going to give it to every 
quarter to just set duel Deborah Shit.

1540
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:44,600
I can get it through the air on my own.
I need you to give me something that I'm

1541
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:46,490
going to lose.
Is downloaded the whole album.

1542
01:13:46,491 --> 01:13:47,450
Right?
What am I going to do with that?

1543
01:13:47,451 --> 01:13:52,451
Once I get it,
I haven't stuck a fucking CD in my car 

1544
01:13:52,451 --> 01:13:53,930
and ages.
This is a DVD for my kids.

1545
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:54,490
That's the only time.

1546
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,210
Hard disks anymore for my kids.
I'm like,

1547
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:00,810
I'm that guy that needs the product and 
like I feel like the man,

1548
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,520
they're ripping me off.
I got to have the heart.

1549
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:02,610
Okay.

1550
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:07,610
Product.
Do you have an album that you used to 

1551
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,060
roll joints in?
People used to roll joints.

1552
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,860
This is separate.
The seeds.

1553
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:16,060
They have sleeves that were a look like 
acid paper and like rolling.

1554
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:18,480
You can rolling paper.
Which band came with Chung?

1555
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:21,600
Big Bamboo record came with a giant one 
and everybody world.

1556
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:26,610
The big one pounder joint with it.
That's hilarious.

1557
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,210
Great.
Yeah.

1558
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:30,250
They used to have seeds and we'd.
Oh God,

1559
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,670
it would pop.
It'd be smoking.

1560
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,790
There we go.
Pop.

1561
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:36,310
And it would stick.
And you go fucking seeds.

1562
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,340
Yeah man.
You'd have to like sort it out.

1563
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:40,230
Like I remember guys had have to sort 
out.

1564
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:43,830
You'd break it up and then you would be 
doing all this sorting before you rolled

1565
01:14:43,831 --> 01:14:47,010
a joint and you throw it in your 
backyard and go,

1566
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,760
well good luck on that.
Didn't go anywhere.

1567
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:56,120
Right?
Well there was all kinds of different 

1568
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:56,570
ways that you would get seeds with.
And then it wasn't until like,

1569
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,770
I don't know,
when did they start having no seeds?

1570
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,690
I came along to we'd late,

1571
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,050
I think that has seats.
I've always,

1572
01:15:06,051 --> 01:15:09,770
always Mexican brick weed for me.
Press it all together.

1573
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:14,600
And so it come in this brick,
you'd have stems and seeds and you break

1574
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:16,550
it apart and then uh,
you know,

1575
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:20,090
roll it up.
But once that indycar like up and uh,

1576
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,440
you know,
nor cal,

1577
01:15:21,441 --> 01:15:24,380
when they started growing that kill or 
those cola buds,

1578
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:29,410
there was no seeds and that shit,
it was just giant Koala buds and 

1579
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:29,420
everybody's like,
Whoa,

1580
01:15:29,421 --> 01:15:31,940
indicus here.
The new weed off

1581
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:37,170
we'll out of figure out was how to 
genetically like not engineer with like 

1582
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,960
chemicals,
but splicing and using.

1583
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,790
Once those gaps,
those botanists got ahold of weed.

1584
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:48,030
That's when Shit got interesting.
All they needed was just enough 

1585
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:48,460
comfortable space where they didn't feel
like they were gonna go to jail.

1586
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,970
Just give them enough.
So Humboldt was like,

1587
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:54,070
where a lot of that stuff came from 
because like that whole economy up there

1588
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:54,940
is based on weed.

1589
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:59,980
Oh,
tell her I say the Emerald Triangle 

1590
01:15:59,980 --> 01:15:59,980
documentary.
It's unbelievable.

1591
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:03,251
I haven't seen it,
but I know a lot of people grow up 

1592
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:03,251
there.
Yeah,

1593
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:03,330
me too.
And it's like without that,

1594
01:16:03,331 --> 01:16:05,090
that,
that whole area has gone.

1595
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,660
Yeah.
That's what's weird because logging went

1596
01:16:07,661 --> 01:16:11,020
away and a lot of those guys actually 
voted against legalization,

1597
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:13,300
which is really fucked up.
Yeah.

1598
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:15,550
Because they want the money.
They would butcher the prices.

1599
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:17,480
And uh,
if it was,

1600
01:16:17,481 --> 01:16:19,690
it was easy,
you know,

1601
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,570
if it was easy to grow and nobody had 
ever run any risk,

1602
01:16:22,571 --> 01:16:24,880
then it wouldn't be worth it.
They're out of business.

1603
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:26,500
It's not fucked.
Pat Is fucked.

1604
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:31,590
They also voted against like the one of 
the doctors that I've been to for 

1605
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:36,650
recommendations for prescriptions,
he told me that like,

1606
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:37,960
he's like,
quite honestly,

1607
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:42,961
I know doctors that are voting against 
legalization because they want to keep 

1608
01:16:42,961 --> 01:16:44,260
it medical because you've got to keep 
going to the doctor every year and pay a

1609
01:16:44,261 --> 01:16:46,360
fee in order to get your license 
renewed.

1610
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:47,530
And I'm just like,
Whoa,

1611
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,790
it's all money.
Think of that.

1612
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,900
I go,
that's fucked.

1613
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:50,920
I got money.
I go,

1614
01:16:50,921 --> 01:16:52,210
how does that make you feel?
And he's like,

1615
01:16:52,211 --> 01:16:57,211
well,
I feel like I have to adjust my 

1616
01:16:57,211 --> 01:16:57,211
business.
But the right thing to do is to vote for

1617
01:16:57,211 --> 01:16:57,211
legalization.
I'm like,

1618
01:16:57,211 --> 01:17:01,980
that's what he says,
that's going to immediately go out and 

1619
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,940
vote no.
Be on Dr Phil the next day with a tie.

1620
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,410
I want to get high and to get right now.
No,

1621
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,150
no.
I'm on my bike.

1622
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:09,530
No,

1623
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:15,120
ain't no fucking motorcycle.
Have a navigation system on your 

1624
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:15,120
motorcycle?
Uh,

1625
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,180
well I can run it through my phone.
That's cool.

1626
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:23,310
Yeah.
I see those things on the new Harley 

1627
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:24,140
commercials with the other navigation 
screen or like this is nuts.

1628
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:25,640
Like they have,
they have,

1629
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:28,490
but I feel like a motorcycle should be a
motorcycle.

1630
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:31,190
You feel like you should see fucking 
gauge cluster.

1631
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:32,760
And that's it.
That's what I got.

1632
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:36,230
When I see the phone ringing,
it's Bluetooth into your motorcycle.

1633
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:36,940
I'm like,
Ooh,

1634
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,860
I got Kinda.
It's,

1635
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:40,150
I get it.
I get that.

1636
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,270
That's convenient.
But she seems weird that in the helmet,

1637
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,600
like Stereo.
So you just turned on like 10 and 

1638
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,940
you're.
And you're just blasting Zeplin.

1639
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:54,350
Oh,
you've seen this heads up display that's

1640
01:17:54,351 --> 01:17:58,820
going to go right into your eye.
That will gouge out your brain.

1641
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:03,830
That's a stupid one.
There's a better one where it's up in 

1642
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:03,830
here.

1643
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:06,270
It's just like right here and you don't 
see it and you can see behind you.

1644
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:08,470
That is a big risk that guys.
Kate,

1645
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:13,100
take a,
putting that metal square by inches from

1646
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:18,101
his eyes that that's stupid.
Knowing that he's going to be crashing 

1647
01:18:18,101 --> 01:18:21,581
that bike,
the great likelihood at least once in 

1648
01:18:21,581 --> 01:18:21,920
his life.
Have you had a bad crash thing?

1649
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:24,020
It's so funny,
man.

1650
01:18:24,021 --> 01:18:29,021
I always talk about people like there's 
two things I hate when you're riding the

1651
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:31,640
one guy that comes up and we got you 
crashed yet.

1652
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:36,730
Which if you did,
you don't want to relive it with a 

1653
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:36,730
stranger.
You know what I mean?

1654
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:36,770
Like,
yeah,

1655
01:18:36,771 --> 01:18:39,260
let me just tell you about how bad I 
crashed.

1656
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:43,400
I've been trying to forget it and the 
other one is I had one of those.

1657
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,760
They always tell you they had some year 
they had and they didn't have it in l 

1658
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,520
and it sell it.
Got,

1659
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:51,290
you know,
wife had the kids.

1660
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,060
It's just like those are the two things 
I hate,

1661
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,310
but no,
never crashed.

1662
01:18:57,330 --> 01:19:02,330
Those poor bastards.
Look at you and get you out there and 

1663
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:02,840
living the dream.
When I used to live the dream,

1664
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:08,650
I used to go out there and risking at 
feeding off the adrenaline ticket 

1665
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:09,080
chances,
cutting lanes.

1666
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,420
I had some friends from Canada,
from Alberta,

1667
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:16,450
and they had never been to California 
before and they didn't know that you 

1668
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:17,500
were allowed to cut lanes and so these 
people would drive.

1669
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:19,250
They're like,
what the fuck is going on?

1670
01:19:19,251 --> 01:19:23,000
These people are mania.
They're flying by him with the highway.

1671
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:28,000
They were freaking out because you can't
do that in Canada state.

1672
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:33,190
It's a really new,
believe it only state is it really the 

1673
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:36,911
own fucking statement.
And they just pat where he passed it 

1674
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:36,911
like two weeks ago.
That's so crazy.

1675
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:39,160
I can't believe it.
It's such a bad law.

1676
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:40,610
So horrible.
It sucked.

1677
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,380
Um,
especially with people texting.

1678
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,480
Oh,
I get it for them.

1679
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:46,580
It's awesome.
You're stuck on the four or five.

1680
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,470
Everybody else is dead and you're 
moving.

1681
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:53,740
That is awesome.
I totally get it from their point of 

1682
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:53,740
view,
but from a safety point of view,

1683
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:54,980
how the fuck.
First of all,

1684
01:19:55,100 --> 01:20:00,100
why do I have to wear a seatbelt if this
dude doesn't even have a fucking shell 

1685
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,280
on?
He's on a bike.

1686
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:07,030
I have to have a seatbelt.
This fucking guy is even surrounded by 

1687
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:08,470
anything.
They just did a study

1688
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:13,590
for two years straight and fanned out.
Splitting lanes is safer than sitting in

1689
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:17,850
traffic because the texters are crashing
into dudes.

1690
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:20,760
That's true.
They're just like texting and boom.

1691
01:20:20,761 --> 01:20:25,761
They hit the guy on the bike and it's 
also not illegal to do it in shorts.

1692
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:31,480
How that's the dumbest fucking thing.
When you see people with a short sleeve 

1693
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:35,121
shirt on or no sleeves in shorts,
like how come I have to wear a seatbelt 

1694
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:39,880
or I'll tell you what.
You want to Google a man rides 

1695
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,610
motorcycle thongs.
It'll fucking make you throw up.

1696
01:20:41,611 --> 01:20:46,611
I don't need.
I see guys in thongs around La riding 

1697
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:47,580
scooters.
So just hoping you talk about them.

1698
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:52,770
You're talking about them on a podcast.
I'll look at their feet.

1699
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,210
Their feet are bad.
Google it,

1700
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:55,260
man.
I get broken off.

1701
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:59,820
Oh yeah.
When they crashed the concrete there.

1702
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,520
Barefoot,
barefoot.

1703
01:21:02,521 --> 01:21:03,630
Equal concrete.

1704
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,860
Sixty,
barefoot plus concrete.

1705
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:09,690
Ooh,
Jesus Christ.

1706
01:21:09,691 --> 01:21:11,250
That's a mess.
That's ugly.

1707
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,810
That's.
You'd never walk right again.

1708
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:18,760
It's so.
Grow into the rainbow with your fucking 

1709
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,120
dean always makes me nervous.
So he,

1710
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:19,480
like,
he,

1711
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:19,890
he,
he,

1712
01:21:19,891 --> 01:21:24,891
because he drives his motorcycle to like
San Diego or Arizona and stuff like 

1713
01:21:24,891 --> 01:21:24,891
that.
In that one,

1714
01:21:24,891 --> 01:21:29,770
like recently there was like that big 
storm and the whole time you're coming 

1715
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:31,530
back driving through like rain.
That was,

1716
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:36,690
how do you drive through that?
Can you even see or he hit one puddle,

1717
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:38,190
wouldn't you just spin out?
Well,

1718
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:40,920
I'm not stupid like,
but that got caught.

1719
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,540
I was uh,
I ride everywhere.

1720
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:47,541
I have no car,
so I've done all my spots on 

1721
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:51,141
motorcycles.
So I go to San Diego and I'm doing the 

1722
01:21:51,141 --> 01:21:53,520
weekend and it Saturday night I usually 
leave Saturday night after the three day

1723
01:21:53,521 --> 01:21:54,480
weekend,
a ride home,

1724
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:57,030
but it was rain and I go to sleep and 
wake up.

1725
01:21:57,030 --> 01:22:00,030
The next day I wake up,
it looks pretty clear.

1726
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:01,410
Hey,
get on the bike.

1727
01:22:01,411 --> 01:22:06,411
And as soon as I get out of San Diego by
the checkpoint there it starts fucking 

1728
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,640
pouring man like I hadn't seen in La and
years.

1729
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,370
And I'm like,
well this is it man.

1730
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:16,500
I got a windshield,
you know?

1731
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:21,770
And I just,
I just go because it's one of those 

1732
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,551
things where you're broke so you go,
well do I spend money on a motel six 

1733
01:22:25,551 --> 01:22:27,780
here on the side of the highway or just 
try to make it.

1734
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:32,781
And I rolled with,
it took me about three hours and it was 

1735
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:37,761
funny,
right when I got to Disneyland it 

1736
01:22:37,761 --> 01:22:37,890
totally stopped raining and by the time 
I was home I was completely dry.

1737
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,040
Really?
Yeah.

1738
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:44,080
Because it was like sun out and you know
there's another 40 minutes on the bike 

1739
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,090
and the sun even bad.

1740
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,140
No,
it's not that bad.

1741
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:50,220
But it seems like that drive in the rain
is probably really fucking hard to see.

1742
01:22:50,221 --> 01:22:51,330
Right.
It's hard to see in.

1743
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,780
It's super nerve racking because the 
trucks are sprain.

1744
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:57,000
Big Spray.
It's the trucks,

1745
01:22:57,001 --> 01:23:02,001
the 18 wheelers that are on the five,
they're spraying big time and you're 

1746
01:23:02,001 --> 01:23:02,001
like,
Whoa,

1747
01:23:02,001 --> 01:23:04,650
fuck.
So you're just trying to go wake far out

1748
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:05,630
to the left.
Them.

1749
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,190
It's potential wiping out.
Must be really fucking keeping your,

1750
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:12,400
your senses on the edge.
Huh?

1751
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:13,330
Brutal.
Joe.

1752
01:23:13,331 --> 01:23:16,810
I'll tell you one time I had to,
I had to do this Gig in Bakersfield,

1753
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:19,430
uh,
like two years in and I was like,

1754
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,820
I can't cancel.
They won't ever booked me again.

1755
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:25,010
And I wrote up the five,
the grapevine.

1756
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:29,920
It got to the top.
It was snowing like a light snow.

1757
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,930
Oh No.
My thumb,

1758
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:36,160
my right thumb was frozen to where I was
like,

1759
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,420
I couldn't get it anywhere.

1760
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,700
Like my thumb was numb.
It was like,

1761
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,450
you've frozen barehanded.
No,

1762
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:44,610
I got gloves,
but you're going and your hand is tucked

1763
01:23:44,611 --> 01:23:49,611
here so you're cool.
But the thumb was out like this and I 

1764
01:23:49,611 --> 01:23:50,890
was going to fuck my right thumb is 
frozen man.

1765
01:23:50,891 --> 01:23:55,891
I don't feel it's.
I pull up in a truck stop and I was 

1766
01:23:55,891 --> 01:23:58,891
drinking hot chocolates and I bought 
some kids mittens and put them 

1767
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:04,081
underneath my glove.
So I put these mittens on and then my 

1768
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:06,240
gloves and I get to the Gig and there's 
like nine people there.

1769
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:09,640
Nine people at a bar gig risked your 
life.

1770
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:10,660
I know.
I was like,

1771
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:13,340
what the fuck?
I was so mad.

1772
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:16,540
And then I did 15 minutes and turned 
around and rode home.

1773
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,600
Oh my God fucked.
He also told me something.

1774
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:24,601
I didn't know that when people flick 
cigarettes out there that it actually 

1775
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:26,090
sometimes gets into motorcycles,
like coats.

1776
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,860
It had one go down my shirt.
I almost crashed these people,

1777
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:34,780
they flick cigarettes out all day long,
all fucking day long.

1778
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:37,000
And they don't even care.
Just boom.

1779
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:39,880
One went down my shirt and I was riding 
going,

1780
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,350
oh fuck.
Oh.

1781
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:44,170
And I couldn't get over because I was in
traffic.

1782
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,660
And I was like,
what the fight?

1783
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:50,670
It's just burning me s on my chest.
He just sent like a man and just touch.

1784
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:54,500
I got it out of your chest.
I got over.

1785
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,400
Fucking madness.
Can understand.

1786
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,760
I scream at people,
man,

1787
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,590
you know,
my buddy got hit two dragonflies.

1788
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,600
Fucking we're going around a turn 90.
They were stacked on top each other.

1789
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,450
We're riding like CHP style,
mma next to each other.

1790
01:25:13,451 --> 01:25:18,451
We go around a turn and I see him.
His arm flies off his fucking handlebar 

1791
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:20,500
and he's like,
well,

1792
01:25:20,501 --> 01:25:21,280
and the bite,
I go,

1793
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:22,870
well this guy is going down.
What happened,

1794
01:25:22,871 --> 01:25:27,871
I thought he was having a heart attack 
because guys have heart attacks and 

1795
01:25:27,871 --> 01:25:30,751
strokes and shit.
I look in my rear view mirror and I've 

1796
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:35,430
gone and he's pulled over.
His face is split open because he got 

1797
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:40,051
cut from hitting these things that like 
90 and they were two dragonflies or like

1798
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,210
just like sandpaper that hit him in the 
face and he's like,

1799
01:25:43,211 --> 01:25:44,200
dude,
I almost die.

1800
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,700
Two dragonflies.
Fucking.

1801
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,350
That's why you have to have goggles.
I wear a full face.

1802
01:25:50,351 --> 01:25:52,420
I don't fuck around and that's why some 
people don't.

1803
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,510
They have those little skullcaps on 
sunglasses.

1804
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,330
Dumb a bro.
I'm a rebel.

1805
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,970
Some people ride around with no helmets 
and other states.

1806
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:03,790
So you get to Arizona doing

1807
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,560
comedy and Arizona.
Everyone's riding route.

1808
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:08,200
Sure.
Fuck.

1809
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,490
Is there a seatbelt law in Arizona?
Yeah.

1810
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:15,560
Plus plus motorcycles.
How Arizona is a state.

1811
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:18,380
It's one of those people don't think of 
it.

1812
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:23,420
You think of it as like white people and
like you think of it as like Arizona's 

1813
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:27,041
like golfers or something like that.
A lot of people think of it as a 

1814
01:26:27,041 --> 01:26:27,800
Scottsdale.
Yeah,

1815
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:32,030
Tucson or a tempe rather like real nice,
cute.

1816
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:37,240
But no,
a big part of Arizona is the wild 

1817
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,410
fucking west guns anywhere concealed 
carry.

1818
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:40,980
Like I had a friend,
uh,

1819
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,630
who,
uh,

1820
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:46,710
he has a lot of guns and he got pulled 
over in Arizona and he had to tell the 

1821
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:47,780
cop that he has guns in the trunk and 
the guy,

1822
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:48,380
the cops,
like,

1823
01:26:48,381 --> 01:26:49,010
wow,
what do you shoot?

1824
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:52,070
And they started having a fucking cool 
gun conversation.

1825
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:53,900
The guy.
Well I just let me check real quick,

1826
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:56,210
make sure everything's in order and 
everything was in order.

1827
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:57,320
All right man,
we'll take it easy.

1828
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:00,050
Enjoy your second amendment rights.
That fucking pound knuckles and go about

1829
01:27:00,051 --> 01:27:04,070
their business to gun nuts.
We just met on the tarmac out there.

1830
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,470
I've seen it.
A restaurant,

1831
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:11,710
please check your gun in Arizona.
They had like a fucking wall where you 

1832
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,960
check your guns in some Wyatt earp type 
shit.

1833
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:17,780
You know you got any guns?
Fuck yeah.

1834
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:22,890
Yeah.
I've got a few of those nine 

1835
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:22,890
millimeters.
Yeah,

1836
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:23,060
that's the gunman.
Nine millimeters.

1837
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:24,920
Why do you like them?
Just like the shape,

1838
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,240
the sound,
the bullet,

1839
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,560
everything about it,
man.

1840
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:29,000
It's.
And it's not too big.

1841
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:31,610
It's not too small.
Know it just fires.

1842
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:34,360
As far as handguns go,
it's very easy gun to shoot at.

1843
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,700
I have a glock nine millimeter shoots 
like it's.

1844
01:27:37,701 --> 01:27:38,510
It doesn't like.
No,

1845
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,030
it doesn't.
Like I have a rifle,

1846
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:42,860
the seven millimeter remington ultra 
mag.

1847
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:46,700
I have a 300 win mag,
two big kicking fucking elephant killing

1848
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:50,190
guns.
Bone digs into your shoulder like this.

1849
01:27:50,191 --> 01:27:54,050
It just is such a difference between a 
rifle and a pistol.

1850
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:59,140
Pistols like feel so small.
Like I feel like like if you were 

1851
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,320
hunting with a rifle,
like sometimes people hunt with pistols.

1852
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:02,900
If you're hunting with a rifle and you 
hit something that thing's dead.

1853
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,080
If you you're hunting with a pistol and 
he hit something like,

1854
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:09,800
Ooh,
they might survive the shoot.

1855
01:28:09,801 --> 01:28:14,120
An elk with a nine millimeter and my 
runaway hooker guns,

1856
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:17,340
they keep in their bra.
You ever.

1857
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,910
I love the Desert Eagle.
50 caliber.

1858
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:24,230
Ridiculous gun you ever will see the 
footage girls shooting the Desert Eagle.

1859
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:26,750
That is so good.
Boom,

1860
01:28:26,751 --> 01:28:30,100
right into her hand was one,
two or girls shooting and her,

1861
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:35,120
her tits are exploding like as she 
shooting like the recoils like boom or 

1862
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,610
taste like sugar.
But yeah,

1863
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:40,550
I've seen the girl hit herself in the 
head guy that video.

1864
01:28:40,551 --> 01:28:45,551
There's videos that late night.
You'll just get on and just start 

1865
01:28:45,551 --> 01:28:46,160
fucking laughing your head off.
That person's rude.

1866
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:51,190
Whoever gave that girl that gun.
What the fuck was going to happen in 

1867
01:28:51,411 --> 01:28:52,640
your hand?
It's a canon.

1868
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:57,860
We shot one of those.
Remember Brian when we filmed my comedy 

1869
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:00,050
special down in Tempe in 2005,
we went to the,

1870
01:29:00,051 --> 01:29:02,070
uh,
what was it like the Phoenix

1871
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,620
gun club or someplace?
Gun Club?

1872
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,430
Wherever they.
Yeah,

1873
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:06,910
we shot everything.
Machine guns.

1874
01:29:06,911 --> 01:29:08,560
We Shot Desert Eagles.
Oh,

1875
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:11,820
44 mag dms.
We search out these ridiculous pistols.

1876
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:15,960
They throw your hand back.
You literally can't hold it straight.

1877
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:21,050
You can't know.
And the fire that comes out of it is 

1878
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:23,630
unbelievable.
I grew up in the bay area and I just 

1879
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:25,050
love dirty Harry.
I loved it.

1880
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:30,650
I loved those films and I just loved him
just to Canon like he represented a 

1881
01:29:31,321 --> 01:29:36,321
weird part of San Francisco and that 
wasn't represented anywhere else in the 

1882
01:29:36,321 --> 01:29:40,191
world.
Everybody has thought about San 

1883
01:29:40,191 --> 01:29:40,191
Francisco.
They thought about gay people.

1884
01:29:40,191 --> 01:29:40,590
That was it.
San Francisco was gay people and hippies

1885
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:41,910
and all of a sudden,
wait a minute,

1886
01:29:41,911 --> 01:29:45,150
what is this guy doing here?
And he was a northern California guy.

1887
01:29:45,151 --> 01:29:47,070
I mean he was mayor of Carmel.
Yeah,

1888
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:47,850
I know,
right?

1889
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:48,720
Even nuts.
Yeah.

1890
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:53,900
Unbelievable runs for mayor wins.
Marries the local news caster.

1891
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,190
He did?
Yeah.

1892
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,800
The chick was.
Yeah.

1893
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:00,000
They recently got divorced as like all 
kinds of evil going on.

1894
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:05,120
Who's evil going on?
My kid can't catch a break.

1895
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:10,730
Just add to what a what a God.
The secret was he was gay the whole 

1896
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:11,730
time.
Dirty Harry was actually gay.

1897
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:16,770
Yeah.
It was like overcompensating big black 

1898
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:20,750
guy.
That's what dirty Harry was really all 

1899
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:20,750
about.
It was all about him.

1900
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:21,450
Fighting against is homosexual.
Urgent.

1901
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,330
Sorry.
Kill.

1902
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:23,850
Lucky.

1903
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:35,070
It was a different sort of.
Because like San Francisco was never 

1904
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:36,360
thought of as being like a crime 
fighting town at all.

1905
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,950
You know,
you think in New York,

1906
01:30:37,951 --> 01:30:42,951
New York is where all the cop shows 
where you have a movie like that in San 

1907
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,160
Francisco.
It was cool.

1908
01:30:44,161 --> 01:30:46,740
That guy that was in the first one,
he.

1909
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,040
He plays the a sniper.
He's the dude

1910
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:53,140
from the warriors come out

1911
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:55,140
that guy.

1912
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:05,510
Tough Gig for a dude to be that like a 
character actor,

1913
01:31:05,511 --> 01:31:08,660
psycho guy.
Just be once you're a psycho guide,

1914
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,150
the fucking leading man roles and no 
longer available to you.

1915
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,200
You're a psycho.
God.

1916
01:31:12,201 --> 01:31:15,920
Take the psycho role says it great.
You know what I mean?

1917
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:18,380
Like I've done a few movies and I'm 
always like,

1918
01:31:18,381 --> 01:31:20,450
when?
When do I get to kill a guy?

1919
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:22,250
You know?
I always get killed.

1920
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,840
It's,
you have a weird path in a comedy man.

1921
01:31:26,841 --> 01:31:31,841
I think that's weird.
The weirdest path I've ever heard of 

1922
01:31:31,841 --> 01:31:31,940
being 44 years old and starting standup.
Yeah.

1923
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:37,120
You had a must.
You must have been fucking running like 

1924
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:37,120
you must have hit the ground running.
I never stopped.

1925
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,440
He kind of had to because like if you're
going to really do this,

1926
01:31:39,441 --> 01:31:44,441
like not a lot of time for people to 
accept it right now if you're 53 and 

1927
01:31:44,571 --> 01:31:45,170
they're like,
oh,

1928
01:31:45,171 --> 01:31:46,910
he's been doing comedy for eight years,
people go,

1929
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:47,710
oh,
all right.

1930
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:52,900
Yeah,
but if you're 53 and he just started 

1931
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:52,900
yelling,
Woo,

1932
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:55,840
boy,
you're on your way to 60 before your 

1933
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:56,700
seven years in La.
It's pretty wild,

1934
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:57,920
you know,
but I'll tell you what,

1935
01:31:57,921 --> 01:31:59,890
it saved my life.
Uh,

1936
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,770
I was pretty,
you know,

1937
01:32:02,771 --> 01:32:05,460
when you're 44,
your friends are long gone.

1938
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:07,240
Married with kids.
Cue The music.

1939
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:12,110
Piano,
music.

1940
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:17,890
It's true though.

1941
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:19,230
Oh,
I know what you mean.

1942
01:32:19,231 --> 01:32:21,990
Like in your hold out,
like you didn't get married.

1943
01:32:21,991 --> 01:32:22,620
No family.

1944
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:23,790
Right?
Right.

1945
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:26,280
So you,
did you wonder about that,

1946
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:29,640
about family?
Did you wonder what it was like?

1947
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:34,700
No,
I had one great girlfriend lost her 

1948
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:37,590
because of rock and roll and she raised 
the bar too high.

1949
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:42,770
What was the bar like?
Just I'm saying she was a great 

1950
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:43,200
girlfriend,
like seven years of rock and roll.

1951
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:43,830
Yeah.
Just,

1952
01:32:43,831 --> 01:32:45,390
you know,
just rock.

1953
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,310
Just rock.
Because the one that got away.

1954
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:52,400
Yeah,
she is the one that got check in with 

1955
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:52,400
her every now and again.
I tried it.

1956
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,530
She doesn't have anything for it.
I did Davies Symphony Hall two weeks ago

1957
01:32:55,531 --> 01:33:00,531
in San Fran with Marin and I was like,
come down to the shell and just nothing 

1958
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:04,650
to no man,
but I know she got.

1959
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:06,240
Nah,
she doesn't.

1960
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:10,620
She never got married either.
Maybe I raised her par.

1961
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:14,490
Maybe you did.
Maybe you just need to get together with

1962
01:33:14,491 --> 01:33:16,470
her.
Maybe I've tried it with a bow tie and a

1963
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:19,260
bouquet of flowers.
Ty.

1964
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:23,810
Come on like a wacky weather guy.
You know what I love.

1965
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:29,770
What I do better though is like I did 
some movies and stuff and she didn't go 

1966
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:29,770
like,
oh,

1967
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:30,720
he must be getting famous.
I'm getting back.

1968
01:33:30,721 --> 01:33:32,240
You know what I mean?
She didn't do that.

1969
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:33,870
That was cool.
Let's be honest.

1970
01:33:33,871 --> 01:33:37,080
We really didn't get famous but a person
that's normal

1971
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,720
did.
You really did.

1972
01:33:39,721 --> 01:33:41,140
Maybe then she would,
you know,

1973
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,630
maybe then to like,
hmm.

1974
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:43,680
Uh,

1975
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:46,380
okay,
one more chance.

1976
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,830
But if you sell us out for rock and roll
again,

1977
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:55,320
what was it about rock and roll?
It was just the hours being on the road.

1978
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,410
Yeah,
it's that.

1979
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,030
It's.
It's just like comedy.

1980
01:33:58,031 --> 01:34:00,580
I could never have a girlfriend now it's
I,

1981
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:03,790
I,
I dedicate myself 100 percent.

1982
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:06,400
I'm out seven nights a week.
I don't miss a night.

1983
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:07,840
I can't wait.
Am I going to do.

1984
01:34:07,841 --> 01:34:10,930
Unless they're in the Biz and work and 
then we can hang during the day.

1985
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:13,390
Yeah.
It's hard for people to win.

1986
01:34:13,391 --> 01:34:18,391
The worst thing is when a guy's talented
comic and he gets a girlfriend and she 

1987
01:34:18,391 --> 01:34:20,230
doesn't like the lifestyle,
and then he shifts.

1988
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:21,930
I seen it.
I've seen it happen too.

1989
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,210
And then you run into those guys 10 
years later when the girl had broken up,

1990
01:34:25,211 --> 01:34:27,670
but they want to try all over again.
It's ugly.

1991
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:28,480
It's like,
dude,

1992
01:34:28,481 --> 01:34:30,460
you missed.
You missed the whole thing.

1993
01:34:30,461 --> 01:34:32,560
Like you're not a pro.
Now you try to.

1994
01:34:32,561 --> 01:34:37,561
You do you want to become a pro again?
Me had you had a chance at one point in 

1995
01:34:37,561 --> 01:34:37,561
time,
but now you're fucked.

1996
01:34:37,561 --> 01:34:38,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

1997
01:34:38,281 --> 01:34:43,281
I never wanted to hear this.
Are you going to go out and again 

1998
01:34:43,281 --> 01:34:44,700
tonight?
So I get every night,

1999
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:45,720
you know?

2000
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:47,470
Yeah.
And the ceiling,

2001
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:50,870
especially at 44 starting when you 
really got to commit,

2002
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:54,200
you've got to hit the ground running.
You can't take a few slow years and half

2003
01:34:54,201 --> 01:34:56,720
asset and kind of get back in.

2004
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:58,220
No Way,
man.

2005
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,740
Once I started I was like,
Whoa,

2006
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:04,700
this is hard.
Was it scary being 44 and like beginning

2007
01:35:04,701 --> 01:35:06,950
a new chapter in your life like that?
Or was it exciting?

2008
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:11,060
It was.
It wasn't scary as far.

2009
01:35:11,061 --> 01:35:12,210
I loved it.
I was like,

2010
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:14,360
Oh,
I'm back on stage.

2011
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,370
Oh Shit.
And I'm doing this,

2012
01:35:16,371 --> 01:35:20,540
but the survival mode is brutal.
You know,

2013
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:22,940
it costs a fortune.
I'm 40,

2014
01:35:22,941 --> 01:35:24,370
$49,
what am I going to do?

2015
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:26,590
Live with nine dudes,
you know?

2016
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:31,900
Hey,
my rent's 300 p like the older brother 

2017
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:31,910
that gives advice to the young crazy 
kids.

2018
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:35,960
This is not how you do ketamine boys.
You gotta be careful.

2019
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:38,960
You can't intramuscularly shoot without 
having alcohol on hand.

2020
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:42,140
Don't know what the fuck you're doing.
This isn't sterile.

2021
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,740
Yeah,
you know it,

2022
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:48,810
it's just,
I just didn't think it was going to be 

2023
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:49,250
a,
I was going to work this hard,

2024
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:49,940
like,
you know,

2025
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:50,870
I was like,
Oh fuck,

2026
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:52,310
I'm working hard,
you know.

2027
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:53,150
Well,
what did you think?

2028
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:56,270
You think it would be easy?
It did it look easy from the outside,

2029
01:35:56,271 --> 01:36:01,271
like you seen people crack jokes.
I never thought it was going to be easy 

2030
01:36:01,271 --> 01:36:04,600
ever,
but I didn't think it was going to grab 

2031
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,480
me like it did.
I thought,

2032
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,220
Oh yeah,
I'll go down and try it.

2033
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:10,820
And then I started doing it and it 
grabbed me and it took over my life in a

2034
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:12,920
good way and I was like,
wow man.

2035
01:36:12,921 --> 01:36:16,100
I mean I literally work all day every 
day.

2036
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:18,530
I don't take a day off.
What do you mean by all day?

2037
01:36:18,531 --> 01:36:19,370
Everyday?
Like what do you do?

2038
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,470
Well,
I podcast five days a week,

2039
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:24,950
five days a week while I grabbed guests,
want home and bank them.

2040
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:26,660
And then I,
uh,

2041
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:29,650
I'm always auditioning.
Then I write all,

2042
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,700
all day,
like from the sets.

2043
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:34,580
I listened to the sets and I take notes 
and then I go,

2044
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:40,450
right now I'm,
I'm cohost and Tom Green's TV show when 

2045
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:40,570
he's on the road,
I guess tell us.

2046
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:44,000
So there's no days off at none.
How did you,

2047
01:36:44,001 --> 01:36:45,260
uh,
when did you start doing this?

2048
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,570
Tom?
Green thing I love is that he's doing it

2049
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:48,480
still out of his house,
right?

2050
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,610
Oh,
he moved it.

2051
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,220
He got a warehouse,
uh,

2052
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:56,350
in,
in the valley and took all that stuff 

2053
01:36:56,350 --> 01:36:56,680
and moved it to his house and it's about
a month old.

2054
01:36:56,710 --> 01:37:00,470
I've been doing it for about a month now
and it's so great man,

2055
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:04,700
because it's a TV show and so he does it
on a regular basis.

2056
01:37:04,701 --> 01:37:09,701
So you have to guest host.
It's sorta like when Johnny Carson has 

2057
01:37:09,701 --> 01:37:12,720
the same thing,
he goes on the road and then a producer 

2058
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:14,640
sometimes got three guys.
Yeah,

2059
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,720
it's great.
And I,

2060
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:21,650
I've had some really cool guests.
Had Mike Beach who's been an actor for a

2061
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:26,680
35 years.
He was on sunset marquis for six 

2062
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:26,680
seasons.
He played Tio,

2063
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,300
the black gang leader of a grim.

2064
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:32,600
A bastards is also an er.
Had him on,

2065
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:35,390
at Madonna's guitar player,
they just slept for tour,

2066
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:40,860
a Monte Pittman on and uh,
and then I had a guy Shawn Carrigan from

2067
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:46,361
a young and the restless,
so I have different kinds of guests and 

2068
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:47,150
it's cool.
And then we'd take skype calls and uh,

2069
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:52,510
and regular calls.
It's when I first did tom shows like 

2070
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:55,751
when the first time Brian and I had 
thought about doing something and then 

2071
01:37:55,751 --> 01:37:56,790
when he had that set up in living room 
where he was like,

2072
01:37:56,970 --> 01:38:01,970
it was crazy.
He had his own server room with all 

2073
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:03,270
these server set up and these crazy 
fucking lines.

2074
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:05,520
And we were trying to figure out like,
like Brian,

2075
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:06,890
first of all,
one of the thing for Brunswick,

2076
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:07,830
you don't need all of this.

2077
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,940
Essentially.
He was like his own aol.

2078
01:38:14,941 --> 01:38:16,420
We were like,
what is going on here?

2079
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:17,890
It seems like.
Yeah.

2080
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:20,160
And they were doing it with a company 
out of Denver,

2081
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:25,161
you remember?
And the company out of Denver wanted to 

2082
01:38:25,161 --> 01:38:25,161
do something with me and we talked about
it,

2083
01:38:25,161 --> 01:38:25,161
but I was like,
wait a minute,

2084
01:38:25,161 --> 01:38:27,510
what?
What exactly are you doing?

2085
01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:32,530
Like,
how are you doing this like this and 

2086
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:32,530
that's why we started fucking around 
with Justin Dot TV too.

2087
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:38,030
And uh,
we had thought about doing some other 

2088
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:38,160
sort of streaming version of one of 
these things,

2089
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:42,360
but Tom Green had gone balls out from 
the jump.

2090
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:45,240
It was a TV show in his house and his 
house,

2091
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:47,850
his whole house,
this house was abandoned essentially.

2092
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:51,030
He just had a kitchen and a bedroom hit 
a giant server room.

2093
01:38:51,031 --> 01:38:53,700
He had these wires all throughout the 
middle of his house.

2094
01:38:53,701 --> 01:38:57,270
He's fat fucking cables that were laid 
down everywhere.

2095
01:38:57,271 --> 01:38:58,440
You have to step over them.

2096
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:03,560
So he's got all that stuff.
I love Tom Green because he represents 

2097
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:05,780
what I've have.
He's like,

2098
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:08,190
you,
he's a self made,

2099
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:13,220
you know what I mean?
Like he doesn't wait for people to come 

2100
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:13,950
to him.
He just does it since he was like 16,

2101
01:39:13,951 --> 01:39:18,951
you know,
he had a show on public access and 

2102
01:39:18,951 --> 01:39:18,951
Canada.
Then he lands on MTV.

2103
01:39:18,951 --> 01:39:20,870
Then he starts doing his own show,
you know,

2104
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:22,710
it's like pre jack ass and shit.

2105
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,270
Well he's at his best to when he's doing
his own thing.

2106
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:29,960
And when I think his,
his career experience like a wall,

2107
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,180
it was because he was doing a bunch of 
other people's Shit.

2108
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:34,340
He was doing movies he was doing.
And you,

2109
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:39,490
when you start doing that,
you get involved with all these 

2110
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:41,801
different producers and different 
network people and different executives 

2111
01:39:41,801 --> 01:39:45,551
and different people have different idea
of how your thing should go because 

2112
01:39:45,551 --> 01:39:47,660
they're investing money in it and they 
have say they can green light things are

2113
01:39:47,661 --> 01:39:52,661
shut things down and you can't have a 
guy like that land to that kind of 

2114
01:39:52,661 --> 01:39:53,540
constraints because you're never going 
to get a Tom Green.

2115
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:58,680
Yeah.
You get the Tom Green that showed up on 

2116
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,821
MTV,
the Tom Green that was doing that cable 

2117
01:40:00,821 --> 01:40:00,821
access show.
These just a maniac.

2118
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:02,750
Just let that guy beat that.
Yeah,

2119
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:03,980
totally.
Totally.

2120
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:07,090
And that's what he does.
And a lot of people,

2121
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,730
they way they're like,
I hear this a lot.

2122
01:40:09,731 --> 01:40:10,180
They go,
yeah,

2123
01:40:10,181 --> 01:40:12,050
I got no agent or manager.
It's like,

2124
01:40:12,051 --> 01:40:15,040
get me either.
You just fucking go do it.

2125
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:15,490
Man.

2126
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,800
In this day and age is less less 
important than it's ever been.

2127
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:22,430
Totally less important than it's ever 
been is changing on a daily basis.

2128
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:27,490
On a daily basis.
You're getting more and more of these 

2129
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:27,490
social media apps.
That's us.

2130
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:28,220
Bam.
That's cool.

2131
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,930
That's cool.
Yeah.

2132
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:30,600
That's,
uh,

2133
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:31,790
that was,
uh,

2134
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:33,350
we were sitting in this place where 
we're like,

2135
01:40:33,351 --> 01:40:35,390
this is cool.
This whole thing is pretty,

2136
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:36,980
pretty dope.
You could drink.

2137
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:41,060
Were taking calls.
I was like,

2138
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,440
ah,
I love it.

2139
01:40:42,441 --> 01:40:43,910
He had all those pencils.
I don't know why

2140
01:40:44,350 --> 01:40:45,440
I've got it.
Set Net.

2141
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:47,200
Dean del Ray.
Look at it now,

2142
01:40:47,201 --> 01:40:49,180
man.
It's crazy.

2143
01:40:49,181 --> 01:40:50,320
Is it different?
Oh yeah.

2144
01:40:50,321 --> 01:40:51,700
Last same place.
Uh,

2145
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:53,170
he moved,
he got a warehouse.

2146
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,010
He moved all the stuff

2147
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,480
out of his house because he was just 
like,

2148
01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:57,790
I can't have these people in my house 
anymore.

2149
01:40:58,210 --> 01:41:01,390
So chuck is set up now.
It's unbelievable.

2150
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:03,550
He's also been doing a lot of 
periscoping.

2151
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:08,670
Him and Andy Dick.
I mean Andy Dick Pretty much lives on 

2152
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:08,670
periscope now.
It's really weird seeing them on it.

2153
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:10,150
But we ran into him the other day at the
comedy store,

2154
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:13,360
periscoping,
periscope at each other.

2155
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:18,390
I was periscoping him,
periscope and me double what I meant 

2156
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:20,370
tonight as it the same set that he just 
moved to a warehouse and this.

2157
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:21,730
Check it out.
There it is.

2158
01:41:21,731 --> 01:41:23,380
Look,
so he's got.

2159
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,590
Just fast forward a little bit.
This is supposed to be him.

2160
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:27,290
Yeah.
Yeah,

2161
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:28,180
but look,
man,

2162
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:30,260
it's a story.
Eric Griffin.

2163
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:35,290
I know the dude.
It's a straight up talk show inside a 

2164
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:36,150
full warehouse.
Here's,

2165
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:41,190
here's the problem with that is the 
worst dumb fucking way to sit down when 

2166
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:42,580
you're talking to somebody.
Why are you above him?

2167
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:43,980
Yeah.
Know Eric's taller than you.

2168
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,790
And second of all,
why?

2169
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:51,280
Why would you sit like that while he 
sits sideways?

2170
01:41:51,281 --> 01:41:52,720
I.
that's so retarded.

2171
01:41:53,450 --> 01:41:55,150
Podcasts on the way to talk.
This is good.

2172
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:57,670
You look at me.
We're right here.

2173
01:41:58,150 --> 01:42:03,150
There's not one person like people got 
mad at me when I had this special 

2174
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:05,290
ergonomic chair.
It was like taller,

2175
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:10,350
so I got all these tweets like trying to
psychologically have an up try to 

2176
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:15,540
psychologically be above your gross.
I'm way taller than you have to be 

2177
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,650
above.
You'd look down upon you.

2178
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,200
Letterman's a tall dude anyway,
and then on top of that,

2179
01:42:20,201 --> 01:42:21,060
his desk is tall.
Yeah,

2180
01:42:21,061 --> 01:42:21,940
he's very tall.
Oh yeah.

2181
01:42:21,990 --> 01:42:23,590
And on top of that,
his desk is taller.

2182
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,010
That's odd approach,
but that's how everybody always did it.

2183
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:30,760
Was that sideways desk,
the Johnny Carson style desk.

2184
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:31,510
Why?
What did,

2185
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,580
what are you writing books?
What's the desk?

2186
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:36,490
Why do you have a fucking desk to talk 
to people?

2187
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:41,490
You need a desk that seems retarded,
but it's like the guy was a school 

2188
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:43,060
teacher or something.
I mean that's how we looked at it.

2189
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:48,270
A fucking desk and everyone's so on.
Original people are just such copycats 

2190
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:49,960
that everybody.
Craig Ferguson,

2191
01:42:49,961 --> 01:42:50,860
everybody,
Jimmy Kimmel,

2192
01:42:50,861 --> 01:42:53,810
everybody just copies the original 
Johnny Carson up,

2193
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:57,490
which is one of the worst formats that 
were for communicating with people.

2194
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:02,850
The only thing it does is establish that
one person is in control of the 

2195
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:02,850
situation.
The Guy Behind the desk,

2196
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:05,470
that's the captain,
and so you'll be right back.

2197
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:10,560
You know,
he could be right back quicker than if 

2198
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,190
just like all bunch of dudes sitting 
around a circle with the chairs the same

2199
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:15,670
height and in the same style.
And just then it'd be a little weird,

2200
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:17,650
like,
why is Dean that the head?

2201
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:20,140
Why doesn't Tom Green get to decide when
they go?

2202
01:43:20,141 --> 01:43:20,560
You know what I mean?

2203
01:43:21,330 --> 01:43:22,780
That's why I think Joan rivers had it 
best.

2204
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:24,850
She had it in bed,
which is the most comfortable.

2205
01:43:24,851 --> 01:43:27,200
Or just gazing each other's eyes.
May touch some feet.

2206
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:32,600
Amanda.
I didn't get a chance to do that right 

2207
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,600
now.
I'm going to add that I really didn't 

2208
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:34,600
get a chance to meet her either,
but I.

2209
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:34,600
Bummer.
I was booked on that.

2210
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,230
I was booked on that and something 
happened.

2211
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:38,470
We canceled or some,
someone canceled.

2212
01:43:38,471 --> 01:43:42,310
I don't remember the exact details,
but she was an all time great.

2213
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:43,900
Oh God.
All the time.

2214
01:43:43,901 --> 01:43:45,490
Great.
Ballsy to the end.

2215
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:50,810
I mean,
just that what she had to put up with 

2216
01:43:50,810 --> 01:43:52,310
when she decided to run show after 
carson and he just bands

2217
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:54,830
her.
She could have easily just been buried.

2218
01:43:54,970 --> 01:43:56,490
You know,
son was a douchebag.

2219
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:58,070
Oh,
you watch the documentary.

2220
01:43:59,010 --> 01:44:04,010
He had a big dude and he was a big Dick.
Both things were different than,

2221
01:44:04,361 --> 01:44:06,070
man,
you can't be that guy today.

2222
01:44:06,071 --> 01:44:11,071
Nobody would allow it.
It would get out that you're that kind 

2223
01:44:11,071 --> 01:44:13,741
of a con shitty to people,
but it's also back then you know we 

2224
01:44:13,741 --> 01:44:17,161
talked about this with Howard stern and 
radio guys is like back then they were 

2225
01:44:17,161 --> 01:44:19,540
all fighting over a time slot and that's
kind of stupid

2226
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:23,360
time slots are gone now.
It's people whenever they're working and

2227
01:44:23,361 --> 01:44:26,690
listening or working out or commuting or
whatever.

2228
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:29,290
Well because of dvrs and also with 
these,

2229
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:30,920
one of the things that letterman kind 
of,

2230
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:35,950
one of the reasons why he decided to 
step back was what shows had become 

2231
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:40,070
mostly is like the show would get a 
certain amount of views but would really

2232
01:44:40,071 --> 01:44:45,071
would get a lot of use,
would be the clips from the show that 

2233
01:44:45,071 --> 01:44:48,161
would go online and then people will be 
able to access those whenever they 

2234
01:44:48,161 --> 01:44:48,980
wanted it and that became a big thing 
and he was missing that.

2235
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:51,200
He was like,
we're not doing that.

2236
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:54,710
Like Jimmy Fallon is doing that Kimmel's
doing that.

2237
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:57,350
We're not doing that anymore.
And he just realized that that the whole

2238
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:00,410
genre was kind of passing his style by.

2239
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:01,520
Yeah.
They're like,

2240
01:45:01,521 --> 01:45:06,521
Marin was on last week and they made the
quip that Marin stops masturbating 

2241
01:45:06,521 --> 01:45:11,231
because it drought because he 
masturbates in shower and it was a huge 

2242
01:45:11,231 --> 01:45:12,320
clip on youtube.
You're instantly going to watch it,

2243
01:45:12,321 --> 01:45:13,390
you know,
because uh,

2244
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:16,540
they break it down into the,
the meat of the interviews,

2245
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:20,360
the funny jokes where you can watch the 
show kind of in like 15 minutes.

2246
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:23,270
Yeah.
Like that Louis ck thing.

2247
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:26,080
Everything is great and no one's happy.
No.

2248
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:31,210
The thing about a technology that was on
Conan and that became like this huge 

2249
01:45:32,181 --> 01:45:37,181
viral sensation which was way bigger hit
than the actual episode itself,

2250
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:38,020
which,
you know,

2251
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:40,630
not that many people watch conan 
anymore.

2252
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:41,860
Yeah,
it's pretty low,

2253
01:45:41,861 --> 01:45:44,690
right?
It's very low in comparison to like what

2254
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:47,180
the Johnny Carson show used to be at one
point in time.

2255
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:50,780
There's no show like that where 
everybody watches the tonight show,

2256
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,290
a million a night,
Carson.

2257
01:45:53,310 --> 01:45:56,440
And then I guess when he signed off $60 
million on the 97.

2258
01:45:56,441 --> 01:45:56,560
Yeah.

2259
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:00,690
When you get on the tonight show back 
then they made a star out of you.

2260
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,440
There's no show like that anymore.
That makes someone a star,

2261
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:09,620
but if you became a regular in the 
tonight show and he would sit on the 

2262
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,230
couch next to Johnny,
you were in man.

2263
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:12,570
You made it.
You were royalty.

2264
01:46:12,571 --> 01:46:14,020
You were.
You were adorned,

2265
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,800
you were knighted.
Yeah.

2266
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:16,680
Steven,
right.

2267
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:20,250
I mean it changed his world.
Was that Letterman or was that Carson?

2268
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:21,060
Carson,
Carson.

2269
01:46:21,061 --> 01:46:25,280
He was asked back the next day because 
we come back tomorrow and he came back,

2270
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:27,090
did another set the next day or 
whatever,

2271
01:46:27,091 --> 01:46:27,380
but

2272
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:31,250
I.
I said this to people all the time.

2273
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:34,400
It's,
it's bigger to do Rogan,

2274
01:46:34,401 --> 01:46:39,320
podcast or Marin or say the top five 
than it is to do it tonight.

2275
01:46:39,321 --> 01:46:40,910
Show set.
Now it is.

2276
01:46:40,911 --> 01:46:43,100
Yeah,
because I go all over and people go,

2277
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:48,130
man,
I heard you on such and such and it's 

2278
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:49,860
amazing because people find those 
podcasts at different times.

2279
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:49,980
If

2280
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,680
you're on TV goes by and if they didn't 
see it,

2281
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:56,190
they didn't see it,
but everyday somebody finds an episode.

2282
01:46:56,191 --> 01:47:01,191
I was on a say this a year from now that
I just heard John Rogan man and they 

2283
01:47:01,861 --> 01:47:06,861
discovered on their own timeframe.
Well we have it set up the most access 

2284
01:47:07,141 --> 01:47:09,270
possible to.
I don't have a subscription based.

2285
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:12,630
Some guys like you can get the first 
episodes like Marin has that right?

2286
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:13,800
Yeah,
the backlog,

2287
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:16,770
first 50 or free or whatever,
and then you buy the backlogs.

2288
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:20,160
But I feel like like you fuck yourself 
when you do that.

2289
01:47:20,161 --> 01:47:23,670
I feel like the real connection is,
is the fact that it's all free.

2290
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,140
That's a big.
That's the,

2291
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:25,440
the,
the,

2292
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:26,790
the easiest.
He can get it.

2293
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:31,791
Whether it's through stitcher or through
youtube or through ustream or Vimeo or 

2294
01:47:31,791 --> 01:47:36,471
whatever the fuck it is.
You just gotta be able to get it as 

2295
01:47:36,471 --> 01:47:36,471
easily as possible.

2296
01:47:36,471 --> 01:47:40,370
And then if people like it,
it just spreads the growth we're 

2297
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:42,210
experiencing because of just word of 
mouth.

2298
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:44,880
We're up 2 million downloads from last 
month.

2299
01:47:44,881 --> 01:47:47,100
Wow.
10 million in a month.

2300
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:51,480
I call it.
It's like an exponential fucking tsunami

2301
01:47:51,481 --> 01:47:52,830
of madness.
It's crazy.

2302
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,200
I call it the,
uh,

2303
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:58,140
it's like metallica.
It's the old school grassroots.

2304
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:02,160
Metallica had a cassette tape,
like 40 people got them.

2305
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:05,280
Lars sent them two guys.
I love Metallica.

2306
01:48:05,281 --> 01:48:07,230
Send me a tape.
They copied those tapes,

2307
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:10,110
they send them to their buddies,
their buddies copy those tapes.

2308
01:48:10,111 --> 01:48:12,750
They send them in their bodies in a 
matter of five years.

2309
01:48:12,751 --> 01:48:16,860
There's probably $200,000
of those cassettes out grass roots.

2310
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:21,920
Tell me.
It's not ironic that Lars Ulrich wasn't 

2311
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:22,200
gonna to take down napster after all 
that.

2312
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:27,380
So Larry,
it's like word of mouth and the ability 

2313
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:28,440
to spread your shit was what made them 
in the first place and then he's like,

2314
01:48:28,441 --> 01:48:29,850
hey man,
we want that money.

2315
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:33,540
That money.
Napster should have used Trey Parker and

2316
01:48:33,541 --> 01:48:34,920
Matt Stone.
Instead.

2317
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:39,950
They gave a vhs.
They made a vhs tape as a little 

2318
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:43,310
Christmas gift.
It was like a 10 minute thing and then 

2319
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:43,310
that spread through Hollywood over 
night.

2320
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:47,920
I saw it.
I saw it back then before the show was 

2321
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:47,920
on.
Yes,

2322
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:47,920
I did.
That was the Brian Boitano one.

2323
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,860
Oh my God.
It was God damn genius.

2324
01:48:49,861 --> 01:48:51,330
Well,
Brian Boitano do.

2325
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:55,890
Alls I'm saying is metal people,
the way they spread stuff are like what?

2326
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:58,680
Pod comedy podcasts people are.
It's great.

2327
01:48:58,681 --> 01:48:59,250
They're like,
man,

2328
01:48:59,251 --> 01:49:04,251
did you hear this show?
I think one of the best things about 

2329
01:49:04,251 --> 01:49:06,600
comedy podcast is unlike what happened 
with Johnny Carson and Joan rivers,

2330
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:10,500
podcasts was all support other podcasts,
so it seems to be across the board.

2331
01:49:10,501 --> 01:49:13,050
I haven't seen any beef where podcasts 
are saying,

2332
01:49:13,051 --> 01:49:14,760
hey,
if you do Adam Carolla show,

2333
01:49:14,761 --> 01:49:15,830
you can't do my show.

2334
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:16,980
No one does that.
No,

2335
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:18,960
that was the model.
That was the model.

2336
01:49:18,961 --> 01:49:20,760
They all did it.
They all did totally.

2337
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:24,450
They all fucked each other because of 
that and because they were fighting over

2338
01:49:24,451 --> 01:49:29,451
these time slots and everyone had this 
famine theory going on where if you 

2339
01:49:29,551 --> 01:49:34,551
weren't number one,
you were below number one and if you 

2340
01:49:34,551 --> 01:49:34,551
were losing,
if you're in second place,

2341
01:49:34,551 --> 01:49:37,530
he made less money and everyone's 
panicking so they had these politics are

2342
01:49:37,531 --> 01:49:42,531
playing back and forth like that.
Remember that movie that they is 

2343
01:49:42,531 --> 01:49:42,531
correct.
Jay Leno,

2344
01:49:42,531 --> 01:49:44,680
David Letterman and the late night wars 
and that.

2345
01:49:44,910 --> 01:49:48,010
Doesn't NBC do that right now with like 
fallon or somebody like

2346
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:53,010
that?
If you do found you can't do camel or 

2347
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:53,010
something,
you can do family.

2348
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:54,550
They probably have laws like that.
You know,

2349
01:49:54,551 --> 01:49:55,240
they probably.
I mean,

2350
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:57,550
some people could probably do whatever 
the fuck they want,

2351
01:49:57,551 --> 01:50:01,480
but they probably have laws like that or
unwritten rules didn't.

2352
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:03,040
There you go.
I do them all and they go,

2353
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:04,510
that's fine.
We just want to narrow.

2354
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:09,460
It's a stupid model.
You have to be tuned in by 11:00.

2355
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:11,500
That's when it starts and it ends at 
1:30.

2356
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:15,310
Why?
Just show it all the time.

2357
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:19,180
Have it available whenever anybody wants
to watch it,

2358
01:50:19,181 --> 01:50:24,181
then it will be better.
It's like this model of like tuning in 

2359
01:50:24,181 --> 01:50:25,690
for something and waiting for it.
Like that's why I love Netflix.

2360
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,690
Netflix takes a season and they go a 
season.

2361
01:50:28,691 --> 01:50:31,660
Three of the orange is the new black is 
out.

2362
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:34,150
Good luck.
Then you get all the fucking episodes.

2363
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:38,260
The whole season is out in one fell 
swoop that benchwatch,

2364
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:42,160
which I love to do in a hotel somewhere 
on the road to best tap.

2365
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:47,340
If you get ahold of a fucking series and
you find out about it and you find out 

2366
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:48,370
about it like after five seasons already
done.

2367
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:53,400
Oh,
I didn't find out about game of thrones 

2368
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,171
until I think the second season.
So I watched the whole first season and 

2369
01:50:55,171 --> 01:50:58,640
then deep and when I caught up I was sad
that we week.

2370
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:03,040
That was me with breaking bad three 
seasons straight.

2371
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:08,050
I got the flu,
the flu.

2372
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:10,220
It's still dark.
You're feeling shitty.

2373
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,940
I watched all three and then I was like,
wait,

2374
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:18,160
now I've got a wait.
Oh fuck.

2375
01:51:18,161 --> 01:51:23,161
Yeah.
I think that that's the future is going 

2376
01:51:23,161 --> 01:51:25,870
to be.
We're going to laugh one day thinking 

2377
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:25,870
about the idea of tuning into a special 
time to watch a show like,

2378
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:29,690
well not like a world premiere.
APM shouldn't ever eat your popcorn once

2379
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:34,900
you've had it for hours uploaded,
uploaded.

2380
01:51:34,930 --> 01:51:37,780
So I can get it whenever on demand is 
the future 100 percent.

2381
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:39,850
Oh yeah.
Everything else is stupid.

2382
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,880
It really is the idea of like tuning in,
like I guess maybe new shows with that 

2383
01:51:45,311 --> 01:51:48,040
exception because the end of the day you
do want to kind of find him.

2384
01:51:48,041 --> 01:51:51,280
What the fuck is going on the world even
though shows man,

2385
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:56,430
they're getting trounced by like the 
young Turks and all these online shows 

2386
01:51:56,430 --> 01:51:56,950
that can do whatever they want.

2387
01:51:57,070 --> 01:51:57,520
Well,
twitter,

2388
01:51:57,521 --> 01:52:01,860
as far as schools,
you find out news immediately.

2389
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:02,790
Instantly.
Yeah.

2390
01:52:02,930 --> 01:52:04,240
Rip.
Someone will tag you.

2391
01:52:04,270 --> 01:52:05,020
Oh Shit.
Yeah,

2392
01:52:05,021 --> 01:52:07,660
and just the think when periscope does 
catch on more,

2393
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:09,730
it's going to be news,
twitter,

2394
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:14,760
but video.
So like if something's happening in 

2395
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:17,070
Washington,
we could just turn to that exact street 

2396
01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:18,810
for people on periscope right there.
We've got four different camera views.

2397
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:21,690
Totally right now and that's what it's 
going to be like.

2398
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:24,370
USTREAM did a lot of that during the 
ferguson riots.

2399
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:28,810
Streaming services that do that during 
the during Baltimore.

2400
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:31,150
All that kind of stuff is the future.
Oh God.

2401
01:52:31,151 --> 01:52:32,020
Yeah.
Periscope.

2402
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:34,870
I mean that is definitely the future 
man.

2403
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,390
I was watching somebody last night for 
an hour.

2404
01:52:37,391 --> 01:52:42,391
I had no idea who they were.
They were just as miscellaneous person 

2405
01:52:42,391 --> 01:52:43,110
in Germany.
Just watching them hanging out,

2406
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:46,220
which things that we were watching

2407
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:51,220
the twitch channel which has all these 
people playing video games and then 

2408
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:51,220
you'll,
you'll look down and say,

2409
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:51,460
Whoa,
Whoa,

2410
01:52:51,461 --> 01:52:51,890
Whoa,
hold on.

2411
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:54,850
That guy's got 10,000
people watching him play a video game.

2412
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,790
That fucking arena filled with people 
and you think about if you're performing

2413
01:52:58,791 --> 01:52:59,840
in front of 10,000
people,

2414
01:52:59,841 --> 01:53:01,040
you'd be like,
Holy Fuck,

2415
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,500
you reach 10,000
people with your words.

2416
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:04,700
That's crazy.
Right?

2417
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,660
Guys playing a video game.
Did you read,

2418
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:08,990
did you read that article,
Joe?

2419
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:14,350
Um,
which has really hit me big time as a 

2420
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:15,740
comedian.
If you have 1000 true fans,

2421
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:18,560
you can survive as an artist.
What does that,

2422
01:53:18,561 --> 01:53:20,330
what are you showing me?
I was just showing that the other day on

2423
01:53:20,331 --> 01:53:22,370
periscope at 10,000
live viewers.

2424
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:28,220
You had 10,000
people watching live on periscope live 

2425
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:28,760
at the same time.
I don't know if it's all the same time,

2426
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:33,761
but it was 10,000
different people watch and it was just 

2427
01:53:33,761 --> 01:53:33,761
fucking with people.

2428
01:53:33,761 --> 01:53:33,761
I'm like,
wait,

2429
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:36,320
I'm sorry,
what are you saying?

2430
01:53:36,321 --> 01:53:38,310
If you have a thousand true fans,
what?

2431
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:38,840
Yeah,
yeah,

2432
01:53:38,841 --> 01:53:40,730
there's a,
there's an article a guy wrote,

2433
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:46,540
I read it online about two weeks ago and
he said that if you as an artist have 

2434
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:51,320
1000 true fans,
you could survive a doing art,

2435
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:56,410
whatever form of art you do forever.
Because he said the 1000 people,

2436
01:53:56,571 --> 01:53:57,210
which you think,
oh,

2437
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:00,380
that sounds pretty easy.
I'm trying to get 100 right now.

2438
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:04,610
This is an incredible article.
If you read this,

2439
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:06,180
it doesn't matter.
Well,

2440
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:11,240
we'll get to the end of the long.
The long tails of famously good.

2441
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,600
What?
Okay.

2442
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:14,930
Just stop.
I'm reading.

2443
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,430
Fuck scrolling.
Fuck.

2444
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:20,750
The long tail is famously good news for 
two classes of people.

2445
01:54:20,751 --> 01:54:25,751
A few lucky aggregators such as Amazon 
and Netflix and 6 billion consumers of 

2446
01:54:25,751 --> 01:54:26,990
those two.
I think it's okay.

2447
01:54:26,991 --> 01:54:28,970
This is what they said though.

2448
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:33,970
Basically as if you have 1000 fans that 
each spend about $100 a year on your 

2449
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:35,810
meaning.
They bought a DVD,

2450
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,750
you know,
or they bought a ticket,

2451
01:54:38,751 --> 01:54:43,751
a couple of tickets or they watched your
special 100 a year.

2452
01:54:43,821 --> 01:54:46,400
You got about 100,000
after everything,

2453
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:47,960
maybe 50,
60.

2454
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:49,910
You could survive.
Awesome.

2455
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:51,380
On that.
Every year.

2456
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:54,260
The problem I have is the term true fan,
right?

2457
01:54:54,261 --> 01:54:57,580
I fucking,
I don't even like saying fans either.

2458
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:59,360
People who,
like you say friends,

2459
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:00,980
people who like soldiers,
what you're doing.

2460
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:04,140
I always say,
I always tell friends,

2461
01:55:04,870 --> 01:55:07,750
Maris,
I call them my friends because we're.

2462
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:11,270
If they're in the stuff I'm.
We would be friends.

2463
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:16,330
Yeah,
if you're doing good shit and people 

2464
01:55:16,330 --> 01:55:16,330
like your good shit and they keep 
supporting it.

2465
01:55:16,330 --> 01:55:20,310
When you have a commitment with them,
it's kind of cool because it's like you 

2466
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:20,660
have customers.
It's like say if you were like a guy who

2467
01:55:20,661 --> 01:55:23,120
made great shoes or something and about 
handmade shoes,

2468
01:55:23,121 --> 01:55:28,121
you've got a bunch of customers that 
swear by the Dean del Rey shoe and they 

2469
01:55:28,121 --> 01:55:31,640
buy them whenever they can and it's like
if you're doing good work and there they

2470
01:55:31,641 --> 01:55:36,641
appreciate good work.
If you really can nail it and just lock 

2471
01:55:36,641 --> 01:55:36,641
it as a comic,
it's a.

2472
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:37,640
it's hard.
Right?

2473
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:40,610
It makes you feel good though.
Like they liked my podcast.

2474
01:55:40,611 --> 01:55:42,140
I get emails at night,
man,

2475
01:55:42,141 --> 01:55:43,010
and they're like,
dude,

2476
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,190
the stuff

2477
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,440
you're talking about with music,
no one likes it.

2478
01:55:46,441 --> 01:55:47,530
Like me,
I feel.

2479
01:55:47,531 --> 01:55:48,170
And your,
you know,

2480
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:51,660
they like I can relate man and it's,
it feels good.

2481
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,080
Let there be taught.
Because your product,

2482
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,660
is it mostly about rock and roll or is 
it all kinds of shit?

2483
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:57,770
It's all kinds of shit,
but I really a,

2484
01:55:57,850 --> 01:56:02,850
I have a lot of rock and rollers on and 
people that I loved in life that have a 

2485
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:06,250
dna that influenced me,
you know,

2486
01:56:06,251 --> 01:56:09,460
I try to seek them out.
Maybe a guy that built choppers,

2487
01:56:09,461 --> 01:56:11,480
you know,
like a or a guy who.

2488
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:16,560
An amazing motor builder and then a 
comedian that blows my mind then a 

2489
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,080
rocker.

2490
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:22,300
And if you have the cool thing about 
what you're doing is you don't have to 

2491
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:26,111
talk to anybody about what you do.
You don't have to like sit down with 

2492
01:56:26,111 --> 01:56:26,111
some guys.
Go Dean,

2493
01:56:26,111 --> 01:56:28,250
I think we're in the wrong direction 
with this.

2494
01:56:28,251 --> 01:56:29,430
What we want to do is,
first of all,

2495
01:56:29,431 --> 01:56:34,220
I want to dye your mustache mustache.
The young kids today,

2496
01:56:34,221 --> 01:56:35,750
they can't relate.
They,

2497
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,940
you know,
the tattoos are great.

2498
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:39,950
But uh,
maybe a lip ring.

2499
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:44,820
Yeah.
They're trying to like get you hip.

2500
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:47,430
Yeah.
Maybe a teardrop tattoo.

2501
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:52,780
Just a little one in the corner.
And I look at dudes like you and Marin 

2502
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:52,780
and,
and,

2503
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:56,220
and,
and those are the dudes and burt and I,

2504
01:56:56,221 --> 01:56:57,930
just,
those are the guys,

2505
01:56:57,931 --> 01:56:58,860
you know,
if you,

2506
01:56:58,890 --> 01:57:01,980
if you like something,
you know,

2507
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:05,010
you figure it out.
Like these guys are doing it,

2508
01:57:05,011 --> 01:57:05,840
man,
you know,

2509
01:57:05,841 --> 01:57:08,100
they're doing it and you figure out 
like,

2510
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:10,230
what is my niche?
I love music.

2511
01:57:10,231 --> 01:57:12,900
Let's talk about rock.
But I love comedy too.

2512
01:57:12,901 --> 01:57:14,400
So we got guys on,
you know,

2513
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,300
being yourself,
being in yourself.

2514
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:20,420
That's the cool thing about podcasts.
You can really truly be yourself because

2515
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:23,040
you just have a microphone and a camera 
on you.

2516
01:57:23,070 --> 01:57:24,440
You don't even have a camera.
You just do.

2517
01:57:24,441 --> 01:57:25,310
It's just audio,
right?

2518
01:57:25,311 --> 01:57:25,910
Audio.
Yeah.

2519
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,130
That,
that's just never.

2520
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:30,020
There's never been a time where you 
could do that.

2521
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:32,270
There's never been a time we could have 
your own fucking radio show.

2522
01:57:32,271 --> 01:57:35,060
It's available instantly.
If I drive home right now,

2523
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:39,470
I can go into itunes or go into the 
podcast app or either on my iphone and I

2524
01:57:39,471 --> 01:57:42,650
just write Dean del Rey and it'll show 
me the therapy.

2525
01:57:42,651 --> 01:57:43,790
We talk,
boom.

2526
01:57:43,791 --> 01:57:46,490
And I'll just start streaming it.
I'll put my foot down,

2527
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:50,450
I put my seat,
my phone down on a seat at a red light.

2528
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:55,840
During that red light.
I picked up your podcast and I'm 

2529
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:55,840
listening to it now.
That's insane.

2530
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:00,070
Or I could say it.
I mean those fucking who say Dean del 

2531
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:04,160
Rey and they'll put it up in a search.
It's amazing how accurate that thing.

2532
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:05,750
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

2533
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:08,480
What's a weird time to be alive with the
whole shit?

2534
01:58:08,810 --> 01:58:13,810
I was.
I was lucky too that I figured out how 

2535
01:58:13,810 --> 01:58:13,810
to do it on my own.
You know,

2536
01:58:13,810 --> 01:58:18,221
like I was looking at Brian.
I went on the road with Brian last year 

2537
01:58:18,221 --> 01:58:21,440
and this fucking guy works his ass off.
We're out on the road.

2538
01:58:21,441 --> 01:58:26,441
How dare you lie to America knows him 
way more than you did when we were out 

2539
01:58:26,661 --> 01:58:28,460
on the road.
He was working his ass off.

2540
01:58:28,461 --> 01:58:30,800
He had the shows booked.
He had the hotel's booked,

2541
01:58:30,801 --> 01:58:35,801
he had the car rental car,
he had the flights and we're cruising 

2542
01:58:35,801 --> 01:58:36,220
around and I was like,
is a self made,

2543
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:37,550
you know,
machine here,

2544
01:58:37,551 --> 01:58:38,360
the desk squad.

2545
01:58:38,770 --> 01:58:41,980
You have to figure out a way to do your 
own in this day and age

2546
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,080
because if you,
if you do bring other people in,

2547
01:58:44,081 --> 01:58:49,081
especially in the beginning,
you're going to have to give them a cut 

2548
01:58:49,081 --> 01:58:52,980
of almost nothing.
So like as you're hustling and you're 

2549
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:56,161
trying to put together these shows,
if you're given a manager 15 percent of 

2550
01:58:56,161 --> 01:58:56,500
that or an agent,
10 percent,

2551
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:59,140
25 percent is gone.
Then you have to pay taxes.

2552
01:58:59,360 --> 01:58:59,610
Yeah.

2553
01:59:00,030 --> 01:59:01,540
Anyway,
it sucks is when you're on the road with

2554
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:06,541
somebody,
it does have a manager and then they 

2555
01:59:06,541 --> 01:59:06,541
still get your 10 percent.
Like,

2556
01:59:06,541 --> 01:59:08,300
I don't want to say who,
but like I like got checks because I was

2557
01:59:08,301 --> 01:59:11,980
on the road and their manager took my.
Took 10 percent of the mic and I'm like,

2558
01:59:11,981 --> 01:59:14,130
wait,
wait,

2559
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:15,100
wait,
wait a minute,

2560
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:17,330
wait a minute.
When we talk a lot,

2561
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:20,950
you got robbed.
You don't have a contract with someone.

2562
01:59:20,951 --> 01:59:24,040
And they took 10 percent of your check.
Who the fuck is this?

2563
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:27,650
Nothing.
Fuck did that.

2564
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:30,280
Somebody robbed.
I know that.

2565
01:59:30,281 --> 01:59:35,281
So it's weird,
but I can tell you that it's going to 

2566
01:59:35,281 --> 01:59:37,000
get a certain amount and then they took 
them out.

2567
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:41,650
Brian opened up the can.
Someone's robbing?

2568
01:59:41,660 --> 01:59:42,400
No,
not that I know,

2569
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:47,880
but uh,
but with working with like Dean 

2570
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:47,880
[inaudible],
the Dean doesn't have it.

2571
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:48,430
Let's have a fake name.
Let's use a fake name.

2572
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:55,320
Rhymes with.
Fuck man,

2573
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:57,760
that's gross.
That's someone's stealing money.

2574
01:59:57,850 --> 01:59:59,090
That's,
you know,

2575
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:02,280
it's just weird that managers even do 
that.

2576
02:00:02,281 --> 02:00:05,000
So damaging you.
If he's not managing judging

2577
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:08,210
you like a manager,
here's a person that Gig.

2578
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:11,120
Where's your cut as well?
Well,

2579
02:00:11,190 --> 02:00:12,250
here's the deal though.
What is this?

2580
02:00:12,270 --> 02:00:14,010
What I'm saying is,
as a manager,

2581
02:00:14,011 --> 02:00:17,640
a manager is a longterm commitment.
I've had the same manager since I was an

2582
02:00:17,641 --> 02:00:21,750
open mic or most comedians try to keep 
it manager for a long time and the agent

2583
02:00:21,751 --> 02:00:26,700
is someone who works with you guys but 
is not as close as the manager.

2584
02:00:26,701 --> 02:00:31,701
The manager's supposed to be the person 
that's like looking over your career in 

2585
02:00:31,701 --> 02:00:35,361
an advisory position and like no one's 
advising you because not advising you go

2586
02:00:35,741 --> 02:00:40,741
on periscope now.
I really think it'll help because he's 

2587
02:00:40,741 --> 02:00:40,741
not advising you at all.
She's taking 10 percent.

2588
02:00:40,741 --> 02:00:42,710
For what reason?
Say stuck in a Gig.

2589
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:44,940
I guess you got to get that money back.
Dude.

2590
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:49,020
Take time.
We're going to find that money back.

2591
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:50,550
One way or another.
We had a book,

2592
02:00:50,551 --> 02:00:52,370
a Gig with this guy and then we'll go 
steal.

2593
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:54,770
Steal that money.
Damn it.

2594
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:57,480
Sorry.
Jacob Dylan loves you,

2595
02:00:57,481 --> 02:01:02,481
man.
I wanted to tell you that he still 

2596
02:01:02,481 --> 02:01:03,951
remembers the time.
His kids got to go down to the set of 

2597
02:01:03,951 --> 02:01:05,610
fear factor.
He never forgot it.

2598
02:01:05,611 --> 02:01:06,120
He was like,
man,

2599
02:01:06,121 --> 02:01:08,760
it was so great.
My kids just lost their minds.

2600
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,940
They were in there.
The guy's eating eyeballs,

2601
02:01:11,941 --> 02:01:13,290
you know,
five feet away.

2602
02:01:13,291 --> 02:01:14,640
And He loved it.
Man.

2603
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:17,130
He's a good guy.
He is a great piece of really,

2604
02:01:17,131 --> 02:01:20,400
really fucking talent singer too.
It's just some of my best friends.

2605
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:25,520
Is He really?
I always wondered why they didn't like 

2606
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,220
take off like those.
What was that song?

2607
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:31,500
I can remember when one headline that,
well they sold.

2608
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:35,130
They sold 26 million records.
I know,

2609
02:01:35,131 --> 02:01:40,131
but wow.
How come you didn't keep making jams 

2610
02:01:40,131 --> 02:01:40,131
like that?
Like what happened?

2611
02:01:40,131 --> 02:01:40,160
Well,
when you have a record

2612
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,860
that fucking big,
it was huge.

2613
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:46,250
That is hard to come.
You know,

2614
02:01:46,251 --> 02:01:48,160
people.
You're wearing an ACDC hats.

2615
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:53,170
So shut your mouth.
Shit for me.

2616
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:58,430
Come on man.
I'm just saying it is hard though.

2617
02:01:58,431 --> 02:02:01,370
Like some people you know.
Here's the example.

2618
02:02:01,371 --> 02:02:03,880
Deeds.
Come on,

2619
02:02:09,650 --> 02:02:10,610
he's giving you.

2620
02:02:12,390 --> 02:02:13,510
I love that.

2621
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:16,950
Yeah.
Want to graduate but not this way.

2622
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:19,520
Here's what you gotta do.

2623
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:23,880
Get that rock and roll voice.
What is that?

2624
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:28,870
Oh my God,
I forgot about that shit.

2625
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:31,710
Stand up so that they can see on the 
camera.

2626
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,450
Wow.
Who did that?

2627
02:02:33,451 --> 02:02:33,970
Man?
Oh,

2628
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:35,580
this guy.
Oh yeah,

2629
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:42,020
that's bad ass guy named Nikko Hurtado.
California guy.

2630
02:02:44,330 --> 02:02:45,840
Yeah,
he worked.

2631
02:02:45,841 --> 02:02:50,130
He worked on a Kat von D on that TV show
a couple of years,

2632
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:55,340
but he has his own place out in grass 
valley and this guy is next level for 

2633
02:02:55,501 --> 02:02:58,290
portraits.
He super talented for everything.

2634
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:01,050
Super fucking talented.
So good man.

2635
02:03:01,051 --> 02:03:04,800
I went out there 16 hours.
That thing ate and ate.

2636
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:07,210
That took 16 hours.
And this,

2637
02:03:08,010 --> 02:03:11,660
this rib cage is the worst place ever to
get a tattoo.

2638
02:03:11,670 --> 02:03:12,780
I'm already started.
I went,

2639
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:18,020
hey,
you might want to move to another spot 

2640
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:18,020
for a few minutes.
That's kind of tender.

2641
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:18,020
And he's like,
yeah,

2642
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:20,460
the whole thing's going to be like that 
as like what?

2643
02:03:20,461 --> 02:03:23,610
We're only 10 minutes.
You're ready to quit?

2644
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:25,840
Oh yeah.
I will make it a bumblebee.

2645
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:28,560
And how much harder is it than your 
arms?

2646
02:03:28,830 --> 02:03:29,970
It's so.
It's,

2647
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:32,180
it's like I can't describe it.
It's,

2648
02:03:32,190 --> 02:03:37,190
it's so bad.
It's so bad that I didn't get angus on 

2649
02:03:37,190 --> 02:03:38,790
the other side,
which was the original plan.

2650
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:43,920
I,
I'll probably do it though if you do it,

2651
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:46,250
we should film it on periscope,
right?

2652
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Actually,
we should have him do it here in the 

2653
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:52,950
studio with Joey Diaz is getting 
sponsors on periscope now.

2654
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,410
There's,
they're contacting him because he does.

2655
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,140
He does the morning joint,
gets up in the morning.

2656
02:03:58,350 --> 02:04:01,530
He lights up a joint and he starts 
dropping science of motivation.

2657
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:03,600
Dog.
Good.

2658
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:04,830
So for,
you know,

2659
02:04:04,831 --> 02:04:09,831
whatever minutes he,
when he gets up and smokes his first 

2660
02:04:09,831 --> 02:04:09,920
joint of the day,
he brings people on this ride with them.

2661
02:04:09,921 --> 02:04:11,640
They call it the morning joint.
So he's going to get.

2662
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:15,300
You could get a sponsor.
You had your tattoo.

2663
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:16,710
That'd be great.
Right?

2664
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:19,740
It might have been paid for the Tattoo 
man about that.

2665
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:24,800
I really want to get the other side done
and I want to get the comedy star Logo.

2666
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:30,000
Yeah.
It's just I needed a new logo a little.

2667
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:30,860
No,
no,

2668
02:04:30,861 --> 02:04:31,170
no,
no.

2669
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:33,330
I love.
It was just a big deal to me though.

2670
02:04:33,390 --> 02:04:38,390
You know what I mean.
My name's on the wall and it was just 

2671
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:41,150
like it was,
it was the biggest thing that ever 

2672
02:04:41,150 --> 02:04:43,050
happened to me and I played music and 
toured with everybody and done all kinds

2673
02:04:43,051 --> 02:04:45,390
of shit,
but that was next level stuff.

2674
02:04:45,391 --> 02:04:47,120
It's great until you look at some other 
people to run them

2675
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:52,200
wall on fucking second split Gaddy boys.
What fucks on that?

2676
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:58,740
We'll take some black paint.
I sat there the other day and just 

2677
02:05:00,530 --> 02:05:03,800
googled like half the names on the front
patio because I was like,

2678
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:05,340
what?
What's a z cat like,

2679
02:05:05,590 --> 02:05:10,590
what is Zika?
And half of them I don't even think are 

2680
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:13,181
real.
I think literally people like came in 

2681
02:05:13,181 --> 02:05:15,131
there and just know there's a few,
like a towing truck company isn't on 

2682
02:05:15,131 --> 02:05:15,131
there.
Like how was it?

2683
02:05:15,131 --> 02:05:16,490
Totally.
Yeah.

2684
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:17,900
I'll show it to you.
It's weird.

2685
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:20,500
It's pretty.
It's it,

2686
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:22,270
it's a big deal.
To me though.

2687
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:25,480
It's just like from the ground up,
I was 44.

2688
02:05:25,481 --> 02:05:27,850
I just stumbled onto that patio like,
Hey,

2689
02:05:28,150 --> 02:05:31,420
I'm here to do comedy and they're like 
get the fuck outta here.

2690
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:37,370
Don't had fitzsimmons on yesterday.
And we were talking about that book 

2691
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:37,590
about the comedy store.
What is it called?

2692
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:43,550
What is it?
Grow to a comment you don't know 

2693
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:49,120
standing there or what is it a.
what's it called?

2694
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:50,470
It's great book,
man.

2695
02:05:50,471 --> 02:05:52,030
I can't believe no one's made that 
movie,

2696
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:55,690
but what he was basically saying was 
that at those days,

2697
02:05:55,720 --> 02:06:00,720
what I'm dying up here,
he was saying that at the description of

2698
02:06:01,361 --> 02:06:04,870
what the store was in the seventies is 
exactly like it was today.

2699
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:09,930
Yeah.
Like it was like common hanging out in 

2700
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:09,930
the back patio.
People going on stage there.

2701
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:10,570
It's amazing.

2702
02:06:10,570 --> 02:06:15,010
That place is kept that freaky vibe.
I did a dollar show last night,

2703
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:20,040
the doormen show and the in the belly 
room on such a good idea for a show to 

2704
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:24,571
you don't understand how happy it makes 
all the like the door guys and stuff 

2705
02:06:24,571 --> 02:06:26,680
that worked there because they pretty 
much used to have two nights of open mic

2706
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:30,010
and then they took it away.
It's way better for,

2707
02:06:30,030 --> 02:06:35,030
for the people that work there because 
that was the only reason why these guys 

2708
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:36,970
work their work their spot.
So the doormen went up,

2709
02:06:37,210 --> 02:06:39,280
Jeff Ross did some time and I closed it 
out.

2710
02:06:39,281 --> 02:06:41,410
I did a half an hour and close it out.
It's all sold out.

2711
02:06:41,411 --> 02:06:44,650
It's only a buck is so cool right there 
in that room.

2712
02:06:44,651 --> 02:06:47,560
Own it.
Says it says capacity 57.

2713
02:06:47,561 --> 02:06:47,790
Yeah.

2714
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:49,200
Fire Marshal.

2715
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:52,880
I think they might vary a little bit 
over.

2716
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:55,370
I don't know what they actually get in 
there,

2717
02:06:55,371 --> 02:06:58,820
but it's probably about 94 during a show
there next week.

2718
02:06:58,821 --> 02:07:03,821
Where you do it with us.
If I'm around warranties doing my 

2719
02:07:03,821 --> 02:07:05,080
podcast next week,
it's like June 17th.

2720
02:07:05,081 --> 02:07:10,081
Um,
we're doing on a Wednesday night and I 

2721
02:07:10,081 --> 02:07:10,081
podcast and comedy show in there.
If we had you,

2722
02:07:10,081 --> 02:07:11,660
it'd be the three of us.
It'd be insane.

2723
02:07:11,661 --> 02:07:14,060
And red bands on Florentines on the 
15th.

2724
02:07:14,061 --> 02:07:17,760
So you're doing it on the 17th at 10?
Yeah,

2725
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:21,320
if I can that,
I'd love it man.

2726
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:24,600
That'd be so fun.
New Material.

2727
02:07:24,601 --> 02:07:27,650
Show the new material shot earlier.
Yeah.

2728
02:07:27,651 --> 02:07:29,060
And then we're right after.
Okay.

2729
02:07:29,061 --> 02:07:30,300
I'll do it.
I think it is.

2730
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:33,260
I'm there then.
Definitely be so great.

2731
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:37,300
That room is just so amazing.
It's magic,

2732
02:07:37,301 --> 02:07:40,150
right?
I started in there and I just ruined the

2733
02:07:40,151 --> 02:07:41,110
country.
I just,

2734
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:42,940
you know,
dice did a special in there.

2735
02:07:42,941 --> 02:07:44,590
He did that first record in there.
Right?

2736
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:46,060
And the o arm,
that's what I heard,

2737
02:07:46,061 --> 02:07:47,230
right?
No.

2738
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:48,700
Yeah,
I think so.

2739
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:50,200
Which one?
Uh,

2740
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:53,050
the very first one that,
the one that just says dice.

2741
02:07:53,051 --> 02:07:54,930
Yeah,
he did that in the belly.

2742
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:58,090
That's not good enough.
I'm looking it up right now.

2743
02:08:01,130 --> 02:08:06,130
Try doing.
What was the story that you told on 

2744
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:07,990
podcast about Joe Walsh?
Bill Walsh.

2745
02:08:08,710 --> 02:08:13,680
Unbelievable story.
Joe Walsh is first of all an APP.

2746
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:15,860
Absolute King.
Like,

2747
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:21,060
let me tell you,
he's one of the nicest guys I've ever 

2748
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:21,060
opened for a.
he's like,

2749
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:22,900
so cool.
You think it'd be Joe Walsh?

2750
02:08:22,901 --> 02:08:24,280
I can't.
I'm in the eagles.

2751
02:08:24,281 --> 02:08:26,410
Who the fuck are those?
It wasn't like that at all,

2752
02:08:26,411 --> 02:08:31,411
but we're eating a,
a deli tray and he comes into the 

2753
02:08:31,411 --> 02:08:32,240
dressing room and he says,
hey,

2754
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:35,080
don't eat that shit.
And we're like,

2755
02:08:35,081 --> 02:08:35,800
what?
Why?

2756
02:08:35,801 --> 02:08:36,370
And he goes,
ah,

2757
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:39,430
you don't know what's in there man,
you know,

2758
02:08:39,490 --> 02:08:41,530
it's just a Shitty Deli tray.
Don't eat it.

2759
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:43,570
He's all.
I got sick before.

2760
02:08:43,571 --> 02:08:44,620
And I was like,
Oh really?

2761
02:08:44,621 --> 02:08:45,160
And he goes,
yeah,

2762
02:08:45,161 --> 02:08:46,090
let me tell you.
He gets,

2763
02:08:46,150 --> 02:08:51,150
after he was out of the eagles,
he had a real low spot where he was 

2764
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:54,400
partying hard and canceling gigs all the
time.

2765
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:58,480
So he cleaned up and the manager said,
we're book a tour,

2766
02:08:59,110 --> 02:09:02,020
but if you cancel one show,
all the shows will be gone.

2767
02:09:02,140 --> 02:09:07,140
So the first night of the tour,
he's backstage eating on the deli tray 

2768
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:11,281
after sound check and about a couple of 
hours later he gets mad food poisoning 

2769
02:09:11,281 --> 02:09:15,610
and he starts just shitting and shitting
and he's like,

2770
02:09:15,611 --> 02:09:17,350
what am I going to cancel on?
The manager goes,

2771
02:09:17,351 --> 02:09:20,110
you cancel this Gig.
The entire tour is gone.

2772
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:25,350
So they go to Kmart or whatever was open
and they get the rubber fishing waders.

2773
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:29,530
He puts them on the ones that go up to 
your tits.

2774
02:09:29,570 --> 02:09:31,990
The river runs through it,
fly fishing.

2775
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:36,520
He gets on stage and just start going at
it.

2776
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:37,600
Why are you shitting?

2777
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:39,980
Like every couple,
like every few minutes is.

2778
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:40,860
Oh,

2779
02:09:41,390 --> 02:09:43,370
oh yeah.

2780
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:52,460
Shitting into rubber letters.
Then he said mid show.

2781
02:09:52,461 --> 02:09:53,370
He didn't expect

2782
02:09:53,420 --> 02:09:58,420
this,
but the heat from the lamp started 

2783
02:09:58,420 --> 02:09:58,420
burning the

2784
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:03,370
diarrhea acid on his legs.
So I looked at it.

2785
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:09,710
Joe Walsh,
we're wearing those because he wore 

2786
02:10:09,710 --> 02:10:12,051
weird shit all the time.
Shitting himself with weirs on first for

2787
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:18,090
him though.
First Minute I met him.

2788
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:19,350
That's the story.
Tell me,

2789
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,530
and I hope it's true.
It's so great.

2790
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:24,060
It's amazing.
What a great story.

2791
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:25,680
I love the eagles,
man.

2792
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:30,740
No,
the eagles or rocky mountain high rocky 

2793
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:30,740
mountain way is one of my favorite songs
ever.

2794
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:31,470
Oh,
I love that song.

2795
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:34,550
I love it.
He a shoes,

2796
02:10:34,551 --> 02:10:35,120
bom,
bom,

2797
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:36,230
Bom,
bom.

2798
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:39,290
What you're going to do to not their 
Mama,

2799
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:40,310
you know,
he uh,

2800
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:42,860
he wrote that one on long run.
It's great.

2801
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:44,800
Life's been good to me so far.
Oh,

2802
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:46,060
great.
Fucking sign.

2803
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:52,550
And it's also one of those songs about a
guy talking about like,

2804
02:10:52,551 --> 02:10:54,290
you know what,
I'm just going to keep doing this.

2805
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:55,210
Yeah,
yeah,

2806
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:55,630
yeah,
yeah.

2807
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:58,700
I'm living retarded rock and roll life.
I got arrested.

2808
02:10:58,701 --> 02:11:01,070
I'm doing stupid shit,
but life's been good to me so far.

2809
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,720
That's my theme song,
man.

2810
02:11:06,180 --> 02:11:09,950
He's in the fucking eagles,
you know all the legendary bands.

2811
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:12,650
And that was the one that was featured 
in the big Lebowski.

2812
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:14,930
Dude.
Hey man,

2813
02:11:14,931 --> 02:11:19,931
it fucking eagles.
Eagles never been offended going,

2814
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:24,450
how could you hit the Eagle's hotel?
California the fuck.

2815
02:11:24,490 --> 02:11:27,590
Do you hate Hotel California?
I that record is so good,

2816
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:29,990
so much good.
All their shit victim.

2817
02:11:29,991 --> 02:11:32,180
The love the eagles documentary,
right?

2818
02:11:32,210 --> 02:11:34,820
Victim of love.
It's fucking bananas.

2819
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:37,220
That's great.
That's a serious fucking song.

2820
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:41,360
Desperado.
The shit is great.

2821
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:43,720
Those guys are legends,
man.

2822
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:45,970
Just handfuls of songs.
Yeah,

2823
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:50,980
they had some great writing to,
but Hotel California is one of the all 

2824
02:11:50,980 --> 02:11:51,800
time great songs.
It really is.

2825
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:54,200
I love it.
That in life in the fast lane man,

2826
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,240
man,
they had some amazing,

2827
02:11:56,241 --> 02:11:58,730
amazing fucking songs.
What happened with those guys?

2828
02:11:58,731 --> 02:12:00,740
They didn't get along.
They broke up and they got back together

2829
02:12:00,741 --> 02:12:02,630
again when they realized how much money 
was involved in.

2830
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:04,340
I remember they did the hell.
They said,

2831
02:12:04,341 --> 02:12:06,560
we'll get back together when hell 
freezes over.

2832
02:12:06,561 --> 02:12:08,170
And then in [inaudible] 96,
I think it was,

2833
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:13,180
it's called the hell freezes over to.
I was glad because I never got to see 

2834
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:17,651
him and they opened.
I saw him at the shoreline and the bear 

2835
02:12:17,651 --> 02:12:20,621
and they opened with Hotel California.
Can you even fucking you opening Hotel 

2836
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:25,070
California?
Man Her in for a great concert.

2837
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:28,550
You Lion Eyes.
That's a great fucking great man.

2838
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:31,580
Great one,
I really liked the long run record.

2839
02:12:31,581 --> 02:12:34,070
A lot of people don't like it.
It's the last one before they broke up.

2840
02:12:34,071 --> 02:12:35,990
It's just pure cocaine,
but man,

2841
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:39,110
that's good songs on it.
I'm already gone.

2842
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:41,600
Yeah,
already already gone.

2843
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:44,200
Already gone is a great fucking song.
Yeah,

2844
02:12:44,210 --> 02:12:46,610
if they had some jams they did,
man.

2845
02:12:46,850 --> 02:12:50,390
Those were some driving songs to be in 
your car and those come on and go,

2846
02:12:50,420 --> 02:12:53,930
fuck yeah,
fuck yeah,

2847
02:12:54,050 --> 02:12:55,580
I love that.
Those guys,

2848
02:12:55,581 --> 02:12:57,950
they had three voices.
That's what's a great band.

2849
02:12:57,951 --> 02:12:58,880
You got,
you got,

2850
02:12:58,970 --> 02:13:02,750
you know Glen Fry who added cool hit on 
Miami,

2851
02:13:02,751 --> 02:13:06,770
vice member smuggler's blues.
That's a great one thing.

2852
02:13:06,771 --> 02:13:11,771
You Have Joe Walsh sings and then you 
have Don Henley sinks and then even the 

2853
02:13:11,771 --> 02:13:16,361
Bass player sings that one can tell you 
what song.

2854
02:13:17,050 --> 02:13:18,290
Yeah,
that guy's great,

2855
02:13:18,291 --> 02:13:19,310
man.
Great Song.

2856
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:21,080
Great Song.
Wow,

2857
02:13:21,081 --> 02:13:22,980
that's right.
That's eagles to jam.

2858
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:27,130
So many hits gets those.
That era,

2859
02:13:27,131 --> 02:13:29,150
man,
there was so much good music out of that

2860
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:32,010
era.
It's weird how music comes big waves

2861
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:35,010
like that.
I guess comedy does too right now.

2862
02:13:35,011 --> 02:13:40,011
It's a huge wave.
This is probably the biggest waves I've 

2863
02:13:40,011 --> 02:13:40,011
ever seen.
Yeah.

2864
02:13:40,011 --> 02:13:43,610
Comedy wise,
I think this is the biggest way that 

2865
02:13:43,610 --> 02:13:45,201
we've ever seen.
We were talking about that the other 

2866
02:13:45,201 --> 02:13:45,201
night at the store.
We were like this,

2867
02:13:45,201 --> 02:13:46,680
the golden era of comedy and everybody 
agreed like at all.

2868
02:13:46,890 --> 02:13:49,520
Like Sarah Silverman was onstage kill 
and I was hanging out with burr.

2869
02:13:49,850 --> 02:13:54,850
We were in the backstage.
We're talking about comedy today and 

2870
02:13:54,850 --> 02:13:55,560
this bird just got back from like 18.
Sold out shows.

2871
02:13:56,350 --> 02:13:57,910
Just crap.
That show.

2872
02:13:57,990 --> 02:14:00,540
It was crazy amazing,
but we were talking about it.

2873
02:14:00,541 --> 02:14:01,230
We're like,
is this.

2874
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:03,540
Has there ever been a better time for 
standup then right now?

2875
02:14:03,541 --> 02:14:05,020
And we were all like,
just not.

2876
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:07,650
There's no better.
I don't think there's ever been a better

2877
02:14:07,651 --> 02:14:12,240
time with like more like big name 
headliners and more young guys coming up

2878
02:14:12,241 --> 02:14:12,990
like the store.

2879
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:16,500
I've been around the store.
I took a seven year break,

2880
02:14:16,501 --> 02:14:20,550
but I started there in [inaudible] 94.
I never saw crop of hungry,

2881
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:25,580
dedicated new guys.
Like now it's like there's always a few 

2882
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:29,571
guys that were okay and I would like 
find those guys and try to help them 

2883
02:14:29,571 --> 02:14:29,571
would grab them,
like,

2884
02:14:29,571 --> 02:14:30,090
look,
you could stay alive,

2885
02:14:30,091 --> 02:14:31,470
but you got to keep moving,
you know,

2886
02:14:31,471 --> 02:14:33,600
but now it's like they have their own 
ecosystem.

2887
02:14:33,601 --> 02:14:37,450
It's a totally different thing.
There's way more power like that,

2888
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:41,070
that having that roast battle and all 
these different,

2889
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:44,500
like these bonding shows,
they have these bonding shows,

2890
02:14:44,501 --> 02:14:44,730
you know?

2891
02:14:44,970 --> 02:14:49,970
Absolutely.
They're creating a complete environment 

2892
02:14:49,970 --> 02:14:49,970
of art.
Man.

2893
02:14:50,030 --> 02:14:52,230
You know,
it's like there's no one around going,

2894
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:54,660
sorry man,
you look like this or that,

2895
02:14:54,661 --> 02:14:56,610
or you're too old or too young.
It's like,

2896
02:14:56,611 --> 02:14:59,430
Hey,
we're all here and we're creating this.

2897
02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:02,160
Well that say that they're always the 
problem.

2898
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:04,470
People that you're too young,
you're too old,

2899
02:15:04,471 --> 02:15:05,250
you're too this.
You're too,

2900
02:15:05,251 --> 02:15:06,660
that you're too tall,
you're too short.

2901
02:15:06,661 --> 02:15:08,460
You those people.
Always wrong.

2902
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:12,000
Always wrong.
Because guys like Joey Diaz just exist.

2903
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:14,970
They don't.
You can't ever script that.

2904
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,340
You can't hope for that to walk through 
your door.

2905
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:21,210
You can't turn a guy into that does.
That is what it is.

2906
02:15:21,211 --> 02:15:24,240
And he's the funniest guy.
If this is the funniest time for comedy,

2907
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:29,300
I think it is.
I think d is the funniest guy that's 

2908
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:29,300
ever lived.
I really do.

2909
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:30,240
I don't think there's ever been any 
funnier.

2910
02:15:30,241 --> 02:15:32,370
I seen kinison live.
I've seen Hicks live.

2911
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:36,420
I seen what I saw prior live.
It was already really late in his life,

2912
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:40,230
but no one is ever crushed in front of 
me.

2913
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:42,390
Like,
like Joey Diaz has.

2914
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:47,480
The other night he did the comedy story,
did the or and I had a post about it on 

2915
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:47,480
instagram.
I was like,

2916
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:50,070
you just broke the world.
It was insane.

2917
02:15:50,071 --> 02:15:53,060
People were falling out of their chairs.
It was screening.

2918
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:54,480
People were screaming,
laughing,

2919
02:15:54,481 --> 02:15:55,110
screaming.

2920
02:15:55,480 --> 02:16:00,480
And the great thing though is that he 
has a guy like you who shouts it out 

2921
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:02,380
that that's not like,
well,

2922
02:16:02,381 --> 02:16:03,670
this is my world,
you know,

2923
02:16:03,671 --> 02:16:05,500
like the old world where people would be
like,

2924
02:16:05,501 --> 02:16:08,530
or this is all me and I'm not letting 
anybody else in.

2925
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:09,540
Yeah.
Well those.

2926
02:16:09,670 --> 02:16:12,400
There's always a group of people.
Back then when they had to be,

2927
02:16:12,401 --> 02:16:17,401
everybody had to be the best.
That was like one guy had the be the 

2928
02:16:17,401 --> 02:16:17,401
guy,
whether it was dice,

2929
02:16:17,401 --> 02:16:19,000
whether it was Kennison or was.
There was like,

2930
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:24,100
there was always one guy that was the 
best and he thought it was the best and 

2931
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:25,780
then he would have guys around him,
but those guys always sucked.

2932
02:16:25,910 --> 02:16:27,580
No,
they weren't that good.

2933
02:16:27,710 --> 02:16:30,010
Somebody called them satellite.
They weren't

2934
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:35,010
that good,
but like Diaz is the funniest guy alive 

2935
02:16:35,010 --> 02:16:38,460
now.
He's the funniest guy ever and he's the 

2936
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:38,460
guy I take with me on the road.
That's great.

2937
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:39,160
Whenever I can,
whenever he's not busy,

2938
02:16:39,161 --> 02:16:42,760
but now it sucks because everybody knows
I can't take him with me anywhere.

2939
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,890
He's always busy.
Sells out every.

2940
02:16:44,891 --> 02:16:46,780
He's just crushed.
Denver.

2941
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:50,650
Just came in for NATO.
He hadn't been there.

2942
02:16:50,651 --> 02:16:52,360
He had been banned from that club 
forever.

2943
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:57,390
Wow.
I'm at nine in there at the end of the 

2944
02:16:57,390 --> 02:16:57,520
month places the first time ever.
I love that.

2945
02:16:57,940 --> 02:17:02,940
Amazing.
That's where I filmed my last comedy 

2946
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:04,651
special on comedy central special.
I knew that when I went in and I was 

2947
02:17:04,651 --> 02:17:08,071
like,
this is the one where you did your 

2948
02:17:08,071 --> 02:17:08,071
special on a rocky mountain high.
Right,

2949
02:17:08,071 --> 02:17:12,160
and then I go in there and after the 
first joke I drop in my head,

2950
02:17:12,161 --> 02:17:17,161
I got like edit that fucking rock cave 
hits that.

2951
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:20,320
The people are on the stage,
the places alive.

2952
02:17:20,321 --> 02:17:22,540
It's electric too.
Crazy little club,

2953
02:17:22,570 --> 02:17:23,530
crazy,
crazy,

2954
02:17:23,531 --> 02:17:27,040
crazy little club,
but it's just this time man,

2955
02:17:27,041 --> 02:17:31,150
this is really unprecedented were all 
comedians are supporting each other too.

2956
02:17:31,390 --> 02:17:34,690
It's not like that whole backstabbing 
Johnny Carson type thing we were talking

2957
02:17:34,691 --> 02:17:36,820
about before.
He used to be like that with comedy too,

2958
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:39,380
but sound like that anymore.
Everybody's like,

2959
02:17:39,381 --> 02:17:41,740
this is a great group of people 
supporting each other.

2960
02:17:41,741 --> 02:17:44,550
Now I got lucky.
I didn't come in in the nineties,

2961
02:17:44,710 --> 02:17:45,980
you know,
I mean fun.

2962
02:17:46,030 --> 02:17:47,740
A lot of people already came in the 
nineties.

2963
02:17:47,950 --> 02:17:52,950
Yeah,
but I'm just saying it was like there 

2964
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:52,950
wasn't much of a scene,
you know,

2965
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:55,240
it was after that eighties gold rush.
Well that's when I came in.

2966
02:17:55,241 --> 02:17:57,970
I came in in [inaudible] 94.
That's when I arrived at the store.

2967
02:17:57,971 --> 02:17:59,050
It was the worst time ever.

2968
02:17:59,110 --> 02:18:00,940
Well,
the time when I came in,

2969
02:18:00,941 --> 02:18:04,840
when I first got there,
it was the worst era for the store ever.

2970
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:05,920
Wow.
There was.

2971
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:10,330
You would go there on a Monday or 
Tuesday when he would see dog shit.

2972
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:11,650
Wow.
Those guys were.

2973
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:16,880
There was terrible comedy going on.
A bunch of them and the guy that ran it 

2974
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:20,350
was a fucking drunk and it was,
it was pre Tommy.

2975
02:18:20,351 --> 02:18:23,600
It was another guy read it.
This fucking thing was a disaster.

2976
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:24,640
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2977
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:29,700
Oh God.
There were so many like leftovers that 

2978
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:29,700
should have made it from the eighties 
but didn't.

2979
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:31,630
And they fell apart.
They were still doing the same material,

2980
02:18:31,930 --> 02:18:34,400
but it was the.
You know how you get a few of those guys

2981
02:18:34,401 --> 02:18:36,550
that occasionally you'll see one of 
those guys today.

2982
02:18:37,070 --> 02:18:42,070
It still has the same act for like 
you'll be at the ha ha or giggles or 

2983
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:42,070
something like that.

2984
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:42,370
It's crazy,
right?

2985
02:18:42,390 --> 02:18:43,540
You're like,
Whoa,

2986
02:18:43,570 --> 02:18:47,230
this guy doesn't have.
This is some old material.

2987
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:52,380
Yeah.
Well that was what you've got in the 

2988
02:18:52,380 --> 02:18:55,201
nineties,
but there were guys from the eighties 

2989
02:18:55,201 --> 02:18:55,360
because it was a big wave in the 
eighties.

2990
02:18:55,630 --> 02:19:00,340
The wave was like from 80,
early eighties to like late eighties and

2991
02:19:00,341 --> 02:19:02,590
then it started to die off into the 
nineties.

2992
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:07,760
The comedy clubs started closing.
The Boston scene collapsed like all 

2993
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:09,250
those evening at the Improv shows kind 
of drifted away.

2994
02:19:09,580 --> 02:19:14,580
There was a bunch of those shows for a 
while and then they slowly all faded 

2995
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:18,121
away and that was in the early nineties 
and that's what I came around at the 

2996
02:19:18,121 --> 02:19:18,610
leftovers.
Wow.

2997
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:21,730
There was so much bad comedy and there 
was a very few people.

2998
02:19:21,970 --> 02:19:25,420
There's no one from my era that started 
off in [inaudible] 94.

2999
02:19:25,421 --> 02:19:27,250
That's around today.
Wow.

3000
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:30,620
At the comedy store.
No one knowing that I could think of.

3001
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:34,220
I can't think of one guy who was with me
back then who was in my state.

3002
02:19:35,060 --> 02:19:38,420
I was already headlining on the road and
I had a television show,

3003
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:43,780
but realistically I've learned how to do
standing up at the store and that's bad 

3004
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:43,780
ass.
Realistically.

3005
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:44,960
That's me too.
That's her.

3006
02:19:44,961 --> 02:19:48,620
I learned some jokes.
I knew a little bit about comedy,

3007
02:19:48,621 --> 02:19:53,621
but I learned.
I really learned that at the store that 

3008
02:19:53,621 --> 02:19:55,830
are just.
And it changes all rules and it gets you

3009
02:19:56,391 --> 02:19:57,680
ready when you're out on the road.
You Go,

3010
02:19:57,710 --> 02:19:59,900
oh,
I seen this in the belly rooms.

3011
02:19:59,901 --> 02:20:04,901
The or compressed to a diamond valley 
runs like a half of our half the alarm.

3012
02:20:06,070 --> 02:20:08,050
It's like,
this is a fort.

3013
02:20:08,090 --> 02:20:12,350
I call it a comedy for go upstairs.
You're in the fort,

3014
02:20:12,410 --> 02:20:17,410
you know,
and it just feels good and you're 

3015
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:19,061
looking at naked pictures to collapses.
Especially like those Roast Battle 

3016
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:22,230
Knights.
I don't even like going up there.

3017
02:20:23,010 --> 02:20:24,470
This is going to go in the kitchen.

3018
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:32,040
Too many.
I mean not enough people in here.

3019
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:37,620
It's great now with periscope though,
because all of us just sit and watch it 

3020
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:37,730
on periscope now.
It's got three feeds.

3021
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:41,830
You got to be there though.
Do it because they're going to judge and

3022
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,050
in a couple of weeks I can't wait.
You know what the problem with periscope

3023
02:20:45,051 --> 02:20:50,051
is though,
that some people that are outside of it 

3024
02:20:50,051 --> 02:20:50,051
are not going to get it and they're 
going to get angry.

3025
02:20:50,051 --> 02:20:51,700
Like at the whites only table.
Yeah.

3026
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:54,990
And all the racism and the black wave.
There's like,

3027
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:56,590
what did they call it?
The Negro waves?

3028
02:20:56,970 --> 02:21:00,460
Yeah.
My Boy Jeremiah Watkins is in that white

3029
02:21:00,470 --> 02:21:01,190
though.
He's allowed.

3030
02:21:01,430 --> 02:21:01,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

3031
02:21:03,010 --> 02:21:04,390
It's a whole thing is a.
it's.

3032
02:21:04,450 --> 02:21:07,460
It's a magic place and that killed Tony 
too,

3033
02:21:07,461 --> 02:21:08,580
is a big part of that too.
Yeah.

3034
02:21:08,610 --> 02:21:13,610
Yeah.
You guys doing that podcast out there 

3035
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:15,701
and getting all these young people 
giving them this one minute shot and it 

3036
02:21:15,701 --> 02:21:17,140
made Kim and made sure Sarah.

3037
02:21:17,350 --> 02:21:18,180
No,
those,

3038
02:21:18,230 --> 02:21:23,230
those girls came out of that and now 
they've got careers now things are 

3039
02:21:23,230 --> 02:21:23,230
happening for that.
Well,

3040
02:21:23,230 --> 02:21:23,930
that's a good support group.
You know,

3041
02:21:23,931 --> 02:21:27,410
when you have a podcast and other people
in America are listening,

3042
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:27,880
they get,
man,

3043
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:29,330
I think I could try that,
you know?

3044
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:32,120
Well I get these tweets all the time 
from people.

3045
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:37,150
Like they'll see the show that will put 
together on the ice house or something 

3046
02:21:37,150 --> 02:21:37,150
like that and they'd be like,
fuck,

3047
02:21:37,150 --> 02:21:39,930
I live in the wrong place.
Is Crazy.

3048
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:41,990
You guys have these shows.
They're on a regular basis.

3049
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:42,770
I know,
right?

3050
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:45,000
The other night it was,
it was des.

3051
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:48,920
I rera Brian Cowen,
me and Duncan.

3052
02:21:49,070 --> 02:21:52,250
Oh my.
It was just a fucking tornado hit.

3053
02:21:52,251 --> 02:21:54,620
That place is insane,
dude.

3054
02:21:54,621 --> 02:21:57,440
All those guys on their own make me 
laugh.

3055
02:21:57,441 --> 02:22:00,110
So fucking hard man.
You know,

3056
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:01,200
like Tom,
I rarely,

3057
02:22:01,201 --> 02:22:03,380
I,
I went on the road with him and man,

3058
02:22:03,440 --> 02:22:07,010
I just laughed my ass off the whole time
onstage,

3059
02:22:07,011 --> 02:22:08,240
offstage,
eating,

3060
02:22:08,241 --> 02:22:09,050
whatever,
you know,

3061
02:22:09,051 --> 02:22:14,051
it's just always great.
Like look at you and wanting to be on 

3062
02:22:14,051 --> 02:22:14,650
the road with dom.
So,

3063
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:17,950
so cool.
And he's been in it for ever,

3064
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:19,910
like worries me with his drinking 
though.

3065
02:22:20,090 --> 02:22:23,110
That's the only thing I worry about dom 
is that he's getting older and he just,

3066
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:26,160
he can't hit it hard every night.
Pop a Xanax

3067
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:26,520
and keep.

3068
02:22:28,410 --> 02:22:33,410
When he first came on the podcast,
he was like all fucked up on the Xanax 

3069
02:22:33,410 --> 02:22:33,410
you talked about.

3070
02:22:33,410 --> 02:22:35,960
Still takes them every night.
He takes one every day,

3071
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:40,680
but he likes it for whatever reason,
you know,

3072
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:41,160
I don't know.

3073
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:42,880
Hey,
that is great man.

3074
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:43,740
He's great.

3075
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:44,600
An addiction.
Yeah.

3076
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:46,120
I need to go back to cigarettes or 
something.

3077
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:49,360
The fuck are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

3078
02:22:49,390 --> 02:22:54,390
Mine's comments quit.
You just quit cigarettes for like four 

3079
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:54,390
days.
That's it,

3080
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:55,510
and you're like,
I need to go back to cigarettes as if it

3081
02:22:55,511 --> 02:22:58,090
was a long time ago.
Back in the day,

3082
02:22:58,990 --> 02:23:00,990
working out,
going to pop up.

3083
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:06,260
Of course he made a fort,
added five copies,

3084
02:23:06,591 --> 02:23:09,760
stirs up your toe.
You'll use as an excuse.

3085
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:11,190
Fuck this,
I need a cigarette.

3086
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:14,440
I stub my toe,
scuffed my new sneakers.

3087
02:23:14,441 --> 02:23:15,970
This bullshit need,
man.

3088
02:23:17,060 --> 02:23:22,060
He just got to need to.
You got a need to escape.

3089
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:27,360
Then you've got to be really careful 
about that because you're doing 

3090
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:29,540
something that's going to eventually 
give you an illness and you know,

3091
02:23:29,541 --> 02:23:32,270
most likely one of those incurable ones 
like lung cancer.

3092
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:33,920
And if that happens,
dude,

3093
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:37,730
you'll be thinking like Johnny Carson 
was like Johnny Carson before he died,

3094
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:43,000
would just walk around the house with an
oxygen mask and go those fucking 

3095
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:43,940
cigarettes and that's all he would say.
Those goddamn cigarettes.

3096
02:23:43,941 --> 02:23:44,810
I was fucking cigarettes.

3097
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:47,100
I create a man.
It was brutal,

3098
02:23:47,130 --> 02:23:50,760
but it's like I was telling Brian,
I saw this guy,

3099
02:23:50,761 --> 02:23:53,460
he was 30 and he gets to hang out at 
this bar.

3100
02:23:53,461 --> 02:23:54,990
I'd go to all the time,
one day showed up,

3101
02:23:54,991 --> 02:23:55,410
he goes,
yeah,

3102
02:23:55,411 --> 02:23:57,720
I'm going to be coming here for the rest
of my life.

3103
02:23:57,721 --> 02:23:58,350
And I go,
yeah,

3104
02:23:58,351 --> 02:24:00,390
I know you're here every day.
And he goes,

3105
02:24:00,391 --> 02:24:02,310
no,
I just got six months to live.

3106
02:24:02,340 --> 02:24:07,340
He got lung cancer,
but it was from a specialist or 

3107
02:24:07,340 --> 02:24:07,340
something,
but he also smoked,

3108
02:24:07,340 --> 02:24:10,020
but I saw them whittle away in three 
months.

3109
02:24:10,021 --> 02:24:12,330
He looked like Mr Burns from the 
simpsons.

3110
02:24:12,570 --> 02:24:15,630
He had the oxygen thing and he came in 
and I was like,

3111
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:18,250
I'm off these men and I got the fuck off
him.

3112
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:23,270
It scared me because he was just his 30 
and dead know dead.

3113
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:23,880
No,
no.

3114
02:24:23,881 --> 02:24:28,881
He died instantly and that was an I can 
90 lung cancer's not cute.

3115
02:24:29,550 --> 02:24:30,390
It's gross.

3116
02:24:31,070 --> 02:24:32,350
Yeah.
Nina diction.

3117
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:38,300
I mentioned I'm in a pill addiction but 
that'd be good.

3118
02:24:39,870 --> 02:24:40,720
Xanax.
Uh,

3119
02:24:40,860 --> 02:24:41,540
I just,
I,

3120
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:46,560
I just don't get why.
Like everyone I know is either on 

3121
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:49,031
adderall or Xanax.
They either have an up or down and you 

3122
02:24:49,031 --> 02:24:49,031
talked to these people and they're like,
oh no,

3123
02:24:49,031 --> 02:24:50,800
I only like downers or I only like 
uppers and it's,

3124
02:24:51,090 --> 02:24:56,090
it's everyone seems like they're on 
something for some of the mistakes that 

3125
02:24:56,090 --> 02:24:56,600
people are trying to solve.
Medical.

3126
02:24:56,601 --> 02:24:56,870
Yeah,

3127
02:24:56,970 --> 02:24:57,440
yeah.
No,

3128
02:24:58,110 --> 02:25:00,570
I've tried to go the full clean route 
and be like,

3129
02:25:00,571 --> 02:25:03,130
just to see like my memory is fire right
now.

3130
02:25:03,131 --> 02:25:06,510
I quit caffeine.
My memory is incredible

3131
02:25:06,730 --> 02:25:11,730
because you quit caffeine so it was all 
Kinda just drink like 10 coffees a day.

3132
02:25:12,220 --> 02:25:16,010
Then I'd be on stage and just be like 
bird man.

3133
02:25:16,250 --> 02:25:18,010
Like sometimes they get a twitch up 
here.

3134
02:25:18,011 --> 02:25:19,690
Too much caffeine.
Do you ever get that?

3135
02:25:19,691 --> 02:25:21,730
It's twitching here while you're 
onstage.

3136
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:24,130
Is that what that's from?
From caffeine

3137
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:27,600
or sleep deprivation and it wind stop 
and they'd be like,

3138
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:30,510
God damn it.
My guys are doctors.

3139
02:25:30,520 --> 02:25:33,680
They're self diagnosing.
I'm getting canker sores from mentos and

3140
02:25:33,970 --> 02:25:36,950
this guy's getting twitches from coffee 
for sure.

3141
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:42,660
Definitely from the coffee fucking 25 
years.

3142
02:25:43,361 --> 02:25:45,250
You were stuffing it through your 
fucking nose.

3143
02:25:45,470 --> 02:25:50,470
Oh Man.
I've had some close calls on coke five 

3144
02:25:50,470 --> 02:25:54,310
calls.
I had the numb arm in Marin,

3145
02:25:54,311 --> 02:25:59,110
had an MRI dated a bit about it,
but I was in Laurel Canyon.

3146
02:25:59,111 --> 02:26:03,340
I remember there was just the first time
I ever really saw pyramid a coke,

3147
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:05,680
like people tried to do that because the
scarface,

3148
02:26:06,130 --> 02:26:07,180
you go to parties,
Nigga,

3149
02:26:07,181 --> 02:26:11,140
they had a pyramid of how many people 
are stealing it.

3150
02:26:11,141 --> 02:26:14,620
Like putting them in touch with you 
think.

3151
02:26:14,621 --> 02:26:15,580
Right.
But,

3152
02:26:15,610 --> 02:26:18,370
but like the people that are there,
they're just like,

3153
02:26:18,371 --> 02:26:19,540
yeah,
there's plenty of coke,

3154
02:26:19,541 --> 02:26:21,610
you know,
how much does something like that cost,

3155
02:26:21,611 --> 02:26:24,070
like a pyramid would probably be a key 
of coke,

3156
02:26:24,071 --> 02:26:27,150
you know,
like I don't know,

3157
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:27,890
back then what?

3158
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:32,620
That's big money like a back then and 
eight ball was 3:50.

3159
02:26:32,621 --> 02:26:34,660
Three and a half grams.
Okay.

3160
02:26:34,661 --> 02:26:36,670
Well look,
just give me a guesstimate.

3161
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:38,770
Let's say 5,000
bucks.

3162
02:26:38,771 --> 02:26:40,900
10,000.
Well you think about the amount of money

3163
02:26:40,901 --> 02:26:43,840
to some people spend on parties just for
like catering and shit.

3164
02:26:43,841 --> 02:26:44,260
Yeah,
right.

3165
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:47,470
Having a band play and fucking ice 
sculpture,

3166
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:50,290
why not have a big giant brick of coke?
Yeah,

3167
02:26:50,380 --> 02:26:52,600
absolutely.
And it looked pretty impressive when you

3168
02:26:52,601 --> 02:26:55,720
come in and go,
well that's an actual pyramid of coke,

3169
02:26:56,170 --> 02:26:57,910
but if you got busted,
if the cops came,

3170
02:26:57,911 --> 02:27:00,610
they probably busted for distribution.
That's prison there.

3171
02:27:00,611 --> 02:27:01,450
That's a key.
Uh,

3172
02:27:01,470 --> 02:27:04,990
below you can't go.
We're having a party.

3173
02:27:05,770 --> 02:27:08,270
What kind of party it was.
Smith Barney.

3174
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:10,450
Yeah.
It's such a Walsh party,

3175
02:27:10,451 --> 02:27:11,260
bitch,
get out of here.

3176
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:16,310
I went over and I just kind of scooped a
pile off of it and oh my God.

3177
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:16,930
It's like,
you know,

3178
02:27:16,931 --> 02:27:21,931
you can't tell.
You're not lucky as this looks good 

3179
02:27:21,931 --> 02:27:21,931
here.
There's.

3180
02:27:21,931 --> 02:27:24,730
And I blasted it up and I swear to God 
about it a minute later I was like,

3181
02:27:24,850 --> 02:27:28,930
oh,
my arm was totally numb.

3182
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:31,390
And I was like,
Oh fuck.

3183
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:33,370
And have problems,
you know.

3184
02:27:33,550 --> 02:27:37,900
So do you think that it was cut with 
anything was it was just clean,

3185
02:27:37,901 --> 02:27:40,090
super cold,
you know,

3186
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:44,170
like real cup,
you're not used to doing some super good

3187
02:27:44,171 --> 02:27:44,770
coke.
And,

3188
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:50,000
and I go up to the guy got hit and he 
got to call an ambulance and he's gone 

3189
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:50,980
and he's like,
no way man.

3190
02:27:52,050 --> 02:27:54,490
That'll attract heat.
You gotta ride it out,

3191
02:27:54,491 --> 02:27:57,070
dude,
that's the same thing,

3192
02:27:57,071 --> 02:28:00,460
man was talking about the 18 minutes 
Chinese write it out,

3193
02:28:00,461 --> 02:28:01,300
you know,
and you're like,

3194
02:28:01,301 --> 02:28:02,500
dude,
I eat too much.

3195
02:28:02,501 --> 02:28:05,070
What?
He ate too much Chinese food once,

3196
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:07,780
just like tons and like I guess from the
salt,

3197
02:28:08,110 --> 02:28:13,110
tons of salience that's a week talking 
about doing and almost dying and he's 

3198
02:28:13,110 --> 02:28:13,650
like,
ah,

3199
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:14,790
too much hateful young.

3200
02:28:14,790 --> 02:28:17,190
I almost died.
Totally.

3201
02:28:17,210 --> 02:28:22,210
Same thing like if you eat shitloads of 
like salt in your body or too much like 

3202
02:28:23,001 --> 02:28:28,001
I've had too much sugar in my fucking 
foot starts tingling that ever happened 

3203
02:28:28,001 --> 02:28:31,460
to you?
How do you guys know what is causing the

3204
02:28:31,461 --> 02:28:36,461
ice cream Sundae?
Gummy bears will eat like bags of K.

3205
02:28:37,221 --> 02:28:38,030
I go,
hey dude,

3206
02:28:38,031 --> 02:28:43,031
that was too much.
Your body is held together with those 

3207
02:28:43,031 --> 02:28:46,211
gummy bears.
Gummy bears are the glue to keep your 

3208
02:28:46,211 --> 02:28:49,301
organs functioning.
That's the connections between the 

3209
02:28:49,301 --> 02:28:51,560
neurons and the tissue.
That's limit and they told them,

3210
02:28:51,561 --> 02:28:53,630
don't stop partying because you will 
die.

3211
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,660
I really tell them that they own that 
Mami documentary.

3212
02:28:56,661 --> 02:28:57,500
They're like a,
well,

3213
02:28:57,501 --> 02:29:02,501
your body's immune to it now.
It probably go in shock if you didn't 

3214
02:29:02,501 --> 02:29:02,501
have it.
Whoa,

3215
02:29:02,501 --> 02:29:07,490
that's pretty well.
You drink that much with drinks and a 

3216
02:29:07,490 --> 02:29:08,960
does a little powders I believe is 
living.

3217
02:29:09,060 --> 02:29:11,240
I don't know.
He's like 70 or something.

3218
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:12,650
Can you look that up?
Let me.

3219
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:14,970
He was sick last year.
Pretty bad man.

3220
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,130
From what?
Uh,

3221
02:29:16,131 --> 02:29:19,080
I guess just part of like running your 
body.

3222
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:24,120
I'll forever.
That's not what it looks like now 

3223
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:24,120
though.
Say Sixty nine.

3224
02:29:24,250 --> 02:29:26,950
Let's find a recent image of lemmy a 
like,

3225
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:29,790
right.
I would say right there.

3226
02:29:29,791 --> 02:29:33,090
The hat one with the glasses right 
there.

3227
02:29:33,091 --> 02:29:35,960
That's him there.
That one right there?

3228
02:29:35,961 --> 02:29:36,600
Yeah,
there you go.

3229
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:38,910
The last one.
We the warts on his face.

3230
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:41,130
Did you get those removed?
Because he's letting me.

3231
02:29:41,630 --> 02:29:43,590
Doesn't give a fuck.
He's great.

3232
02:29:43,650 --> 02:29:48,650
He'll fuck him.
Even with these giant gross things 

3233
02:29:48,650 --> 02:29:50,571
growing out of love.
That guy like a watch the documentary 

3234
02:29:50,571 --> 02:29:53,040
mandates.
See there he is.

3235
02:29:53,130 --> 02:29:58,130
There he is with his collection.
He's gotten all those war swords and 

3236
02:29:58,130 --> 02:29:58,130
stuff in his house.
Where does he live?

3237
02:29:58,290 --> 02:30:03,290
He lives by the rainbow in the same 
apartment he's had for like 30 years.

3238
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:04,990
Really?
Yeah.

3239
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:06,450
Wow,
what a mad man.

3240
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:09,240
I have it right.
Just rocker and he's still just hits the

3241
02:30:09,241 --> 02:30:11,790
road and just put a new record coming 
out.

3242
02:30:11,820 --> 02:30:15,180
Does he have any kids?
I don't know.

3243
02:30:15,181 --> 02:30:18,140
I don't think so.
He was.

3244
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:20,310
He had two children.
He was Hendrix.

3245
02:30:20,311 --> 02:30:24,180
Roadie Jesus Christ.
Isn't that crazy?

3246
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:30,260
What a maniac.
Played in a band called a hawk when in 

3247
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:34,731
the 60 days has lost a lot of weight.
Metal injection and click on that.

3248
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:36,180
Yeah.
Scare.

3249
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:38,160
What was his health scare?
He got sick.

3250
02:30:38,170 --> 02:30:39,240
Something was wrong,
man.

3251
02:30:39,241 --> 02:30:44,241
That's the picture right there.
So now he's skinny as fuck.

3252
02:30:45,310 --> 02:30:47,750
There's that guy in the left.
Who?

3253
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:49,800
Chris Jericho?
Yeah,

3254
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,590
he's a wrestler.
Yeah.

3255
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:53,900
I'll dare you.
Yeah.

3256
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:57,080
The singer in a band there is man 
playmates.

3257
02:30:57,110 --> 02:30:59,210
Great.
Sixty nine years old.

3258
02:30:59,211 --> 02:31:00,890
Still parties hard.
Yeah.

3259
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:02,450
Animal.
How much do you think?

3260
02:31:02,490 --> 02:31:05,390
Yes.
Even at 69 tons.

3261
02:31:06,110 --> 02:31:06,990
Rambo,
pussy,

3262
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:11,400
Brian.
Brian.

3263
02:31:11,401 --> 02:31:13,410
It's the same girls.
Same Porn.

3264
02:31:13,411 --> 02:31:17,160
Girls are at the rainbow that are at the
on is a periscope.

3265
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,950
How dare you sold him like that

3266
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:25,520
while on the podcast.
I was at this girl's house the other day

3267
02:31:25,771 --> 02:31:29,220
and some 65 year old guys sitting on the
couch and I'm like,

3268
02:31:29,221 --> 02:31:31,290
why is that guy?
I'm leaving,

3269
02:31:31,291 --> 02:31:36,291
what is this place?
Went over her house and it was a guy 

3270
02:31:36,291 --> 02:31:39,831
just sitting on the couch.
She's invited me back to her house with 

3271
02:31:39,831 --> 02:31:42,891
this girl.
I'm hanging out with these two girls 

3272
02:31:42,891 --> 02:31:42,891
periscoping and then I'm like,
wait a second.

3273
02:31:42,891 --> 02:31:45,480
There's a 65 year old man creepily 
watching me and this was the guy.

3274
02:31:46,110 --> 02:31:47,370
Who was he?
I don't know.

3275
02:31:47,371 --> 02:31:51,300
He's just some doctor to this.
When does it play with the two girls?

3276
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:53,520
One threw up on you.
Hold on.

3277
02:31:53,521 --> 02:31:54,690
Wait a minute,
hold on.

3278
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:59,720
Jesus Christ.
Doctor wanted you to play with these 

3279
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:03,760
guys.
I just wanted to watch us play together 

3280
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:05,901
like all three.
If was just hanging out for you and the 

3281
02:32:05,901 --> 02:32:09,471
two girls and the.
The guy was just like whacking off in 

3282
02:32:09,471 --> 02:32:09,471
the corner.
He wasn't wearing off.

3283
02:32:09,471 --> 02:32:10,340
You're just hanging out just doing this 
weird seed.

3284
02:32:10,341 --> 02:32:15,341
You talk to him at all?
I tried to but he was weird so I was 

3285
02:32:15,341 --> 02:32:15,341
just like,
whatever.

3286
02:32:15,341 --> 02:32:16,950
I'll just.
These two girls are drunk right here,

3287
02:32:16,951 --> 02:32:21,060
so I'll just hang out with them and so 
we're periscoping his house.

3288
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:26,440
I,
I'm starting to think it was jim 

3289
02:32:26,440 --> 02:32:28,330
mentioned,
if you get to that point where you.

3290
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:32,310
You're so desperado is a sugar daddy 
that you tell girls,

3291
02:32:32,311 --> 02:32:33,410
look,
I don't even care if you bring guys.

3292
02:32:33,730 --> 02:32:35,270
Yeah,
I think when you live here,

3293
02:32:35,570 --> 02:32:38,240
I think will bring guys back.
You do whatever you want.

3294
02:32:38,820 --> 02:32:41,660
Just let me know.
Just send me a jerk off in your mouth.

3295
02:32:41,661 --> 02:32:45,790
Every couple of days I ran out.
That is awesome.

3296
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:50,800
I mean I was pretty sick.
What they have to do to get by in this 

3297
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:50,800
world,
man,

3298
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:53,390
people have to fucking survive.
He living on the streets in Bangladesh.

3299
02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:58,630
Alright,
you gotta walk barefoot and carry a 

3300
02:32:58,630 --> 02:32:58,630
basket on your head.
If you're a 65 year old dude and you got

3301
02:32:58,630 --> 02:33:00,230
a house in the Hollywood hills and you 
want to get laid,

3302
02:33:00,231 --> 02:33:01,430
you're not famous.
What do you do?

3303
02:33:01,431 --> 02:33:02,840
You're not lemmy from motorhead,
bitch.

3304
02:33:02,841 --> 02:33:07,210
You got to let these girls live in your 
house and bring home dudes like,

3305
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:08,270
well,
we can't stay.

3306
02:33:08,271 --> 02:33:10,120
We need to bring home guys,
bring them here.

3307
02:33:10,690 --> 02:33:15,690
Pregnant.
Just don't disturb me when I'm beating 

3308
02:33:15,690 --> 02:33:15,690
off.
That's basically the,

3309
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:20,360
the whole recipe of the playboy mansion.
A lot of ways.

3310
02:33:20,361 --> 02:33:20,690
Yeah.

3311
02:33:20,960 --> 02:33:25,960
Well there was a house that I looked at.
There was one point in time where I was 

3312
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:26,350
thinking I should probably live in the 
Hollywood hills,

3313
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:28,660
be easier to get to the store and I get 
home quicker,

3314
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:31,310
get more work done and be like I could 
live anywhere.

3315
02:33:31,400 --> 02:33:33,230
I thought about it for a very short 
period of time,

3316
02:33:33,231 --> 02:33:38,231
like maybe a couple of weeks.
And I looked at this one house and the 

3317
02:33:38,231 --> 02:33:38,480
House that I looked at was a really 
cool.

3318
02:33:38,481 --> 02:33:43,481
And this guy had this glass back window,
like his entire back of his house was 

3319
02:33:43,481 --> 02:33:46,550
glass and he was a guy that invented 
bell bottoms.

3320
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:48,800
Allegedly.
This was a story behind this guy.

3321
02:33:49,070 --> 02:33:50,930
And uh,
they used to call them wild man.

3322
02:33:50,931 --> 02:33:55,931
This case to show up at it is when Eddie
Bravo was a DJ script strip club and uh,

3323
02:33:56,510 --> 02:33:59,600
Eddie used to work at the Strip club and
this guy was rich as fuck.

3324
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:04,840
And he would come in and he would pay a 
shit load of money to get these girls 

3325
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:09,191
come back to his place.
He would go to strip clubs all 

3326
02:34:09,191 --> 02:34:09,191
throughout the valley,
go everywhere wanted you,

3327
02:34:09,191 --> 02:34:13,571
had like a whole place that he would go 
during the day and he would get these 

3328
02:34:13,571 --> 02:34:16,631
girls.
And the story was that this guy was a 

3329
02:34:16,631 --> 02:34:18,100
straight laced guy who smoked a lot of 
cigarettes and he went

3330
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:20,650
to the doctor and the doctor said,
listen man,

3331
02:34:20,651 --> 02:34:22,330
you're going to die.
You got to stop smoking.

3332
02:34:22,331 --> 02:34:23,560
Cigarettes are going to die.
Look,

3333
02:34:23,561 --> 02:34:25,210
if you need to smoke,
smoke weed.

3334
02:34:25,720 --> 02:34:26,710
I smoke pot.
It's not.

3335
02:34:26,711 --> 02:34:31,711
It doesn't give you cancer.
So this guy starts smoking pot joints 

3336
02:34:31,711 --> 02:34:32,830
all day long.
Just changes his life.

3337
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:33,950
Decides,
you know what man,

3338
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,830
I don't want to work anymore.
I have money.

3339
02:34:36,050 --> 02:34:41,050
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm going to just play guitar and I'm 

3340
02:34:41,050 --> 02:34:43,651
going to get hookers.
So this guy decided to do just play 

3341
02:34:43,651 --> 02:34:46,861
guitar and get hookers,
but apparently he was really mean to 

3342
02:34:46,861 --> 02:34:49,261
them.
Which is sort of the opposite of what 

3343
02:34:49,261 --> 02:34:49,261
you expect from potheads,
right?

3344
02:34:49,261 --> 02:34:52,180
That's filed bottom.
Expect gentle and apparently he used to,

3345
02:34:52,270 --> 02:34:55,260
he used to call it like bootcamping them
bootcamp.

3346
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:58,240
These girls who treat them like shit,
who pay him a lot of money,

3347
02:34:58,380 --> 02:34:59,440
do you treat them like shit.

3348
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:04,440
And he got off on the fact that he was 
as gross old guy and he would get these 

3349
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:05,100
hot young girls and you would do mean 
stuff to,

3350
02:35:05,110 --> 02:35:10,110
oh well this guy was selling his house.
So I went to look at the house and I 

3351
02:35:10,601 --> 02:35:12,070
remember looking around and I was 
thinking,

3352
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:15,700
well this house is really expensive and 
it's right there on the street.

3353
02:35:15,970 --> 02:35:19,300
And then I remember thinking like,
this guy has been bringing these hookers

3354
02:35:19,301 --> 02:35:24,301
back to this place.
So it was like a lot of people are 

3355
02:35:24,301 --> 02:35:25,900
probably going to think that this guy is
an asshole and then going to rob them or

3356
02:35:25,901 --> 02:35:26,260
something.
Like,

3357
02:35:26,261 --> 02:35:28,540
what if I buy it?
And they go looking for wild man.

3358
02:35:28,541 --> 02:35:28,960
I'm like,
Yo,

3359
02:35:28,961 --> 02:35:33,961
I live here now.
Fucking two weeks after I thought that 

3360
02:35:33,961 --> 02:35:37,540
he was killed in that house.
He brought a girl home and a.

3361
02:35:37,810 --> 02:35:42,810
apparently the girl brought guys with 
her and they fucking shot him in the 

3362
02:35:42,810 --> 02:35:46,321
neck style,
shot him in the neck and he bled out 

3363
02:35:46,321 --> 02:35:48,280
right in the front where I was walking 
around looking around.

3364
02:35:48,650 --> 02:35:50,400
Why when I was looking around his house,
go on,

3365
02:35:50,410 --> 02:35:52,210
this fucking guy could get shot and this
place.

3366
02:35:53,560 --> 02:35:56,200
It was funny because I brought that up 
and the guy was selling the house,

3367
02:35:56,201 --> 02:35:57,130
the real estate guy.
He goes,

3368
02:35:57,370 --> 02:36:02,370
don't worry,
there's a state of the art security 

3369
02:36:02,370 --> 02:36:02,370
system.
Cameras everywhere.

3370
02:36:02,370 --> 02:36:02,370
And I go,
you know what?

3371
02:36:02,370 --> 02:36:06,921
Those cameras are going to show.
They're going to show a due to ski mass 

3372
02:36:06,921 --> 02:36:06,921
shootings and good luck.
That trial.

3373
02:36:07,430 --> 02:36:09,730
What the fuck are you talking about?
When I say that to the guy,

3374
02:36:09,731 --> 02:36:11,090
the guy was like,
you know,

3375
02:36:11,091 --> 02:36:16,091
the salesmen like,
you try to sell motorcycles just both 

3376
02:36:16,091 --> 02:36:16,420
trying to sell this fucking bad as 
Hollywood hills house.

3377
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:21,840
Um,
but I bet they just fucking sucked that 

3378
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:22,750
blood out with a vacuum.
We cleaned it up nice.

3379
02:36:22,751 --> 02:36:24,580
It's sold that bitch within a week.
Those houses,

3380
02:36:24,581 --> 02:36:26,380
they go like,
I got up there.

3381
02:36:26,650 --> 02:36:28,930
That's Don Simpson's shit.
You ever read that book?

3382
02:36:28,931 --> 02:36:33,931
High Concept?
It was the producer that did all the 

3383
02:36:33,931 --> 02:36:33,931
blockbusters.
He invented the blockbuster,

3384
02:36:33,931 --> 02:36:35,360
like uh,
right after jaws.

3385
02:36:35,361 --> 02:36:39,300
So a top gun.
What's the race one with Tom's offender?

3386
02:36:39,340 --> 02:36:41,550
Days of thunder.
He was a lunatic.

3387
02:36:41,551 --> 02:36:46,551
He gets street walkers,
bring them up to his mansion that had a 

3388
02:36:46,551 --> 02:36:50,191
fucking,
like a 20 foot fence all the way around 

3389
02:36:50,191 --> 02:36:50,760
and they'd be like,
you're going to eat poo and shit.

3390
02:36:53,450 --> 02:36:56,740
He just whipped coke and fucking went 
nuts.

3391
02:36:57,130 --> 02:36:58,660
High Concept.
Read the book.

3392
02:36:58,661 --> 02:37:00,300
It's awesome.
Hilarious.

3393
02:37:00,300 --> 02:37:02,660
But a guy on coke say you're going to 
eat poop.

3394
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:06,090
That language,
like five-year-olds.

3395
02:37:07,290 --> 02:37:11,370
That book is crazy.
Hollywood weird us back then.

3396
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:15,980
That's so fucked.
That thing that men want to women to get

3397
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,740
through,
do degrading shit at.

3398
02:37:17,800 --> 02:37:19,970
So the way this is coming from the host 
of fear factor,

3399
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:24,950
I say with a grain of salt,
but the idea that someone would,

3400
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:30,040
that that's what they get off on to get 
off on taking someone who desperately 

3401
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:33,431
needs the money,
bringing them to their own house where 

3402
02:37:33,431 --> 02:37:35,651
they live and sleep like you're.
You're haunting that place with these 

3403
02:37:35,651 --> 02:37:37,790
memories of Demons bootcamping these 
campaign.

3404
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:40,010
That's what he used to call it.
That was his,

3405
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:43,850
his expression fucking.
He smoked a lot of cigarettes during his

3406
02:37:43,851 --> 02:37:45,730
life.
So he had that raspy cigarette voice.

3407
02:37:45,790 --> 02:37:46,370
Yeah.
Like,

3408
02:37:46,371 --> 02:37:47,310
yeah,
boot camp.

3409
02:37:47,370 --> 02:37:52,370
Um,
I remember when I met the guy felt 

3410
02:37:52,370 --> 02:37:52,730
really creeped out by them.
Like I wouldn't want to buy a house from

3411
02:37:52,731 --> 02:37:54,140
an asshole.
No,

3412
02:37:54,590 --> 02:37:59,590
just that alone.
I wouldn't want just not interested in 

3413
02:37:59,590 --> 02:38:02,531
buying some assholes house.
Now as I think you're the asshole vibe 

3414
02:38:02,531 --> 02:38:03,680
with spirit.
It would stay in the house,

3415
02:38:03,681 --> 02:38:04,040
man.

3416
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:09,320
That's some creepy shit in the Hollywood
hills that has gone down over the last 

3417
02:38:09,550 --> 02:38:14,550
hundred years.
And it's just kinda like those ghost up 

3418
02:38:14,550 --> 02:38:14,550
there

3419
02:38:14,550 --> 02:38:15,960
know that the guy was an asshole.
That'd be one thing.

3420
02:38:15,990 --> 02:38:17,350
And you took it over and you're like,
oh,

3421
02:38:17,351 --> 02:38:22,351
I'll turn it into my house.
I have a nice party with my friends 

3422
02:38:22,351 --> 02:38:22,351
over.
This is my house now.

3423
02:38:22,351 --> 02:38:22,590
Hay House.
I'm just let you know.

3424
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:23,510
No more boot camping.

3425
02:38:24,690 --> 02:38:29,690
You're going to be nice to have 
barbecues and hug.

3426
02:38:33,570 --> 02:38:37,000
We'll fucking swim together.
Everyone's going to be nice here.

3427
02:38:37,580 --> 02:38:38,450
Nope.
Bootcamp.

3428
02:38:42,440 --> 02:38:43,180
Just,
you know,

3429
02:38:43,181 --> 02:38:44,950
if you know that it was an asshole 
house,

3430
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:46,980
it's tough to do.
It's tough to buy.

3431
02:38:47,030 --> 02:38:48,580
You have other choices,
you know,

3432
02:38:48,890 --> 02:38:49,680
want to buy someone's.

3433
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:51,710
It's kind of like joey is this bathroom,
you know,

3434
02:38:51,711 --> 02:38:54,200
that's the most haunted.
It's fucked up place in the road.

3435
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:56,480
Imagine living in his place.
I would bug Joey Diaz.

3436
02:38:56,490 --> 02:38:59,750
His house in a heartbeat.
Ideas had a house and it was for sale.

3437
02:38:59,751 --> 02:39:01,460
I'll probably buy it just to make sure 
nobody else had it.

3438
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:02,210
Yeah.
My buddies,

3439
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:06,040
my buddies moved into Jerry Diaz is a 
apartment building over there.

3440
02:39:07,780 --> 02:39:12,260
No horseplay is crazy.
Crazy.

3441
02:39:12,261 --> 02:39:14,460
Right?
But was during the day

3442
02:39:15,160 --> 02:39:18,440
when Ralphie lived across the hall from 
Doug Stan.

3443
02:39:18,441 --> 02:39:23,441
Hope who lived right down the street 
from Joey and Joey was staying with 

3444
02:39:23,441 --> 02:39:23,840
Gavin.
Oh my God.

3445
02:39:23,841 --> 02:39:27,320
It's chaos.
That was a crazy comedy.

3446
02:39:27,321 --> 02:39:29,150
Like squat house

3447
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:31,090
at the.
They're in there now.

3448
02:39:31,091 --> 02:39:36,091
Luke is the bartender at the store and 
then my other buddy,

3449
02:39:36,951 --> 02:39:38,820
Steve Henry,
he moved in.

3450
02:39:38,821 --> 02:39:41,220
So it's like comedy.
It's across the street from the game,

3451
02:39:41,650 --> 02:39:42,130
right?
Yeah.

3452
02:39:42,131 --> 02:39:44,200
Yeah.
How much does it cost to even rent up?

3453
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:46,750
Nine slash 50.
It's good for the size.

3454
02:39:46,751 --> 02:39:51,751
For one bedroom.
It's like a massive studio was separate 

3455
02:39:51,751 --> 02:39:55,741
kitchen everything,
but you got to a garage and stay for 

3456
02:39:55,741 --> 02:39:55,741
Hollywood.
That's pretty God damn good.

3457
02:39:55,741 --> 02:40:00,540
If one of those places would be a good 
idea to do a podcast audio to you're so 

3458
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:04,621
right now,
like think about like how much you have 

3459
02:40:04,621 --> 02:40:06,391
to pay at the ice house.
You could get like an actual studio 

3460
02:40:06,391 --> 02:40:06,391
apartment.
Totally.

3461
02:40:06,391 --> 02:40:07,570
Where's your studio?
My studio is in a studio.

3462
02:40:08,110 --> 02:40:11,030
Me and a couple of comics.
We're actually thinking about a.

3463
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:12,820
they're building condos across the 
street.

3464
02:40:13,410 --> 02:40:14,060
They're tearing down that

3465
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:17,070
house of Blues.
Just all chipped and yeah,

3466
02:40:17,071 --> 02:40:18,930
that's going down.
Take three more months.

3467
02:40:18,931 --> 02:40:22,480
It's closed three more months and so 
they're building condos are sent.

3468
02:40:22,490 --> 02:40:27,490
Me and a few comics were like,
we should just rent a all chip in like 

3469
02:40:27,490 --> 02:40:27,810
$300 a month or whatever and rent a 
place.

3470
02:40:27,811 --> 02:40:29,760
We could always just crash there if we 
went to.

3471
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:32,040
Yeah.
Instead of over those losers,

3472
02:40:32,060 --> 02:40:37,060
gonna wind up living their true.
Getting high on drugs camp.

3473
02:40:44,870 --> 02:40:49,870
Oh my God,
did I never going to forget that you'll 

3474
02:40:49,870 --> 02:40:49,870
never forget it.
My friend Larry,

3475
02:40:49,870 --> 02:40:50,090
who,
uh,

3476
02:40:50,170 --> 02:40:55,170
used to live in the Hollywood hills had 
the most amazing view I've ever seen in 

3477
02:40:55,170 --> 02:40:56,530
my life up there.
To this day I've seen some dope views of

3478
02:40:56,531 --> 02:41:00,070
nature,
like nature views are my favorite views,

3479
02:41:00,130 --> 02:41:03,700
but nature of use don't work at night.
At night you just see dark mountains.

3480
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:09,000
But Larry had a place at the top of 
heaney and the view was like blade 

3481
02:41:09,731 --> 02:41:10,930
runner.
It was like,

3482
02:41:10,931 --> 02:41:12,790
it didn't seem real.
It would look out.

3483
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:14,620
You're like,
I didn't know anybody got to see this.

3484
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:18,700
Like the view of all those lights from a
certain height,

3485
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:21,640
like you don't want to be too high up,
you know,

3486
02:41:21,641 --> 02:41:23,380
you see it from an airplane.
Looks Pretty Dope,

3487
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:26,380
but there's something about being at the
top of that dough.

3488
02:41:26,381 --> 02:41:31,381
Haney area.
Will you get this grid effect with this 

3489
02:41:31,381 --> 02:41:32,500
amazing light show at night?
We would just go,

3490
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:37,560
we would go out to his place.
I would bring people by his house just 

3491
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:37,560
to look at the view at night and when he
just got to see this,

3492
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:39,070
especially in a clear night,
like after it rained.

3493
02:41:39,130 --> 02:41:41,410
Oh my God,
it was amazing.

3494
02:41:41,460 --> 02:41:44,380
Pauly shore's how would fuck you up?
His same thing.

3495
02:41:45,110 --> 02:41:46,880
He's got the.
He's right at the top.

3496
02:41:46,881 --> 02:41:50,290
I runyon three 63 slash 60.
You got,

3497
02:41:50,710 --> 02:41:55,070
you got a century city,
you got the grove.

3498
02:41:55,190 --> 02:42:00,190
Then over here you have downtown.
Then behind him he has all the hills 

3499
02:42:00,190 --> 02:42:01,130
like running and everything,
you know,

3500
02:42:01,131 --> 02:42:03,650
and it's just with this light spill off 
infinity.

3501
02:42:03,651 --> 02:42:03,710
Okay.

3502
02:42:03,750 --> 02:42:08,750
Pool.
And that would be one of those houses 

3503
02:42:08,750 --> 02:42:10,621
though where you wonder about the 
bootcamp in this house might be haunted.

3504
02:42:13,060 --> 02:42:16,250
You have to bring in some vegans to have
a fucking Vegan.

3505
02:42:16,251 --> 02:42:17,200
Seance.
Yeah.

3506
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:21,380
You'd have to have some sort of a Yogi 
and an infinity pool.

3507
02:42:21,381 --> 02:42:24,620
That's a hooker bath.
Drains.

3508
02:42:24,621 --> 02:42:27,320
Just pubic hair and condos.
And it was an amazing.

3509
02:42:27,321 --> 02:42:32,321
Patty said he bought it from the MTV 
money in the eighties and he still owns 

3510
02:42:32,321 --> 02:42:32,321
it.

3511
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:36,100
Just rents it out and it's a good move.
Yep.

3512
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:39,320
Real estate in the Hollywood hills is a 
great investment at smart.

3513
02:42:39,350 --> 02:42:40,710
Well,
Paul has been smart with his money.

3514
02:42:40,720 --> 02:42:43,880
Like that really smart move.
He owns a place above.

3515
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:45,140
Well,
he sold it to Scott,

3516
02:42:45,141 --> 02:42:45,490
right?
Yeah,

3517
02:42:45,491 --> 02:42:45,890
yeah,
right.

3518
02:42:45,891 --> 02:42:48,000
The one right behind it.
The house know that's,

3519
02:42:48,110 --> 02:42:50,750
that's a great spot to crave.
Someone had that spot,

3520
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:56,300
the place.
It's right at the top of that Little 

3521
02:42:56,300 --> 02:42:56,300
Hill.
Dangerous.

3522
02:42:56,300 --> 02:42:57,410
He asked me to run it for a while.
He's on that house.

3523
02:42:57,440 --> 02:42:59,780
He's like,
you will live and pick the good room and

3524
02:42:59,781 --> 02:43:02,180
then pick like four guys that you want 
to live with it.

3525
02:43:02,181 --> 02:43:02,810
You can.
Uh,

3526
02:43:02,830 --> 02:43:04,190
you know,
it's a great idea.

3527
02:43:04,460 --> 02:43:09,460
Comedy House.
Like they used to have an crest hill 

3528
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:09,460
total.
Yeah,

3529
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:11,981
exactly.
But my only worry was like the comics 

3530
02:43:11,981 --> 02:43:11,990
moving every couple of

3531
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:16,030
months ago can't make rent and then I'll
send you this landlord instead of just a

3532
02:43:16,031 --> 02:43:16,640
room.
A.

3533
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:19,210
It sounds like work.
Yeah.

3534
02:43:19,230 --> 02:43:24,230
You got to collect money.
Chase people down whenever you're 

3535
02:43:24,230 --> 02:43:24,590
dealing with broke dudes.
It's always a man,

3536
02:43:24,860 --> 02:43:26,250
which is exactly what you would deal 
with it.

3537
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:31,260
You got it.
You would wind up having your name on 

3538
02:43:31,260 --> 02:43:31,660
the condo because the older guy,
the ability,

3539
02:43:31,690 --> 02:43:33,550
we'll just,
we'll pay you and then you a man.

3540
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:36,050
You could just sell my part out.
Someone else like what the fuck?

3541
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:38,710
Nobody wants it.
And then how about this?

3542
02:43:38,711 --> 02:43:40,390
You got rent.
Why are you being a Dick?

3543
02:43:40,391 --> 02:43:44,000
Man,
that's the best.

3544
02:43:44,390 --> 02:43:45,700
The best.
Come on man.

3545
02:43:45,701 --> 02:43:48,100
You got money.
You owe money.

3546
02:43:48,380 --> 02:43:50,380
Not what's going on here.
Don't get mad at me.

3547
02:43:50,381 --> 02:43:51,760
You fuck.
It's crazy,

3548
02:43:51,761 --> 02:43:53,410
man.
That's the worst.

3549
02:43:53,411 --> 02:43:56,380
The worst is when broke.
People that owe money.

3550
02:43:56,530 --> 02:43:58,480
Turn it around and get upset at you.
Yeah.

3551
02:43:58,680 --> 02:44:00,130
Oh yeah.
How about,

3552
02:44:00,670 --> 02:44:01,880
how about what?
You know,

3553
02:44:01,950 --> 02:44:03,700
dude,
where were living here?

3554
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:08,750
Yeah.
Now I have to pay your apart and people 

3555
02:44:08,750 --> 02:44:11,080
just always look for some sort of an 
excuse to not have to contribute.

3556
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:13,450
It's just.
And when you're dealing with starving,

3557
02:44:13,451 --> 02:44:18,451
struggling artist,
it's the same sort of mentality that 

3558
02:44:18,451 --> 02:44:18,451
makes people flick cigarettes out the 
window.

3559
02:44:18,451 --> 02:44:19,620
It's not thinking about anybody but 
themselves.

3560
02:44:19,621 --> 02:44:20,650
Yeah,
exactly.

3561
02:44:20,860 --> 02:44:22,510
Exactly.
It's a cigarette thing too,

3562
02:44:22,511 --> 02:44:24,490
man.
There's something about poison your body

3563
02:44:24,491 --> 02:44:26,530
with cigarettes.
I've always wondered,

3564
02:44:26,531 --> 02:44:28,010
like I was hanging out with the tally of
the day.

3565
02:44:28,011 --> 02:44:29,230
I didn't bring it up because I love 
them,

3566
02:44:29,231 --> 02:44:31,180
but smoke cigarette dropped on the 
ground,

3567
02:44:31,181 --> 02:44:32,350
stepped on it,
left it there,

3568
02:44:32,590 --> 02:44:33,220
and I was like,
dude,

3569
02:44:33,221 --> 02:44:34,510
you know,
that's littering.

3570
02:44:34,511 --> 02:44:36,280
Like,
what'd you do that with a rapper?

3571
02:44:36,310 --> 02:44:39,880
Would you do that with like a,
a glamorized growing up,

3572
02:44:39,881 --> 02:44:40,720
you know,
with James,

3573
02:44:40,721 --> 02:44:43,410
Deane stepping on the cigarette or 
flicking it.

3574
02:44:43,411 --> 02:44:46,750
It used to always be like a thing that 
you mean cops would,

3575
02:44:46,751 --> 02:44:48,140
do you know it,
it never was.

3576
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:51,880
It never was considered a lender.
They sent me to the end like and then we

3577
02:44:51,881 --> 02:44:52,990
went to boot camp.

3578
02:44:55,330 --> 02:45:00,330
Oh you want five grand?
The house and put on the gloves.

3579
02:45:06,410 --> 02:45:09,320
Favorite is as they're driving this 
prius.

3580
02:45:09,710 --> 02:45:11,990
Oh,
I'm saving the environment.

3581
02:45:12,140 --> 02:45:15,320
They flick a cigarette out of their 
fucking Prius.

3582
02:45:15,321 --> 02:45:20,321
Dude.
I've had a running tally on this show 

3583
02:45:20,321 --> 02:45:20,990
about people in praises that I've seen 
throw cigarettes out the window.

3584
02:45:20,991 --> 02:45:25,220
It's up to eight people in a prius throw
cigarette out the window.

3585
02:45:25,640 --> 02:45:30,640
It's like,
don't tell me you're driving that Prius 

3586
02:45:30,640 --> 02:45:31,600
for the environment or some money.
They're cheap.

3587
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:34,080
You can try one of those things.
Uh,

3588
02:45:34,170 --> 02:45:36,140
Daniel Cormier,
the UFC light heavyweight champ.

3589
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:41,260
He has won and he said it costs like 30 
bucks to fill up and it lasts a month.

3590
02:45:42,410 --> 02:45:42,910
Yeah.
I went to,

3591
02:45:43,070 --> 02:45:45,280
I went to San Fran with another comic 
and it,

3592
02:45:45,350 --> 02:45:48,500
we put like $26 and we were there.
I was like,

3593
02:45:48,560 --> 02:45:50,840
are you kidding?
Like my motorcycle.

3594
02:45:50,841 --> 02:45:53,840
I stopped three times.
They're great on gas,

3595
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:57,650
but their dog shit cars just killed it 
for me.

3596
02:45:57,651 --> 02:46:01,260
Man.
I've been in so many Prius's lately that

3597
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:05,330
every uber driver has.
One is the track home of cars.

3598
02:46:05,690 --> 02:46:07,640
That's what it is.
It's a track home.

3599
02:46:07,880 --> 02:46:10,190
They all look the.
You just go

3600
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:11,270
in and go,
where's mine?

3601
02:46:11,271 --> 02:46:15,200
Do you ever leave the arclight and you 
go look at the fucking Prius is in here.

3602
02:46:16,870 --> 02:46:17,600
Yeah.
That's all it is,

3603
02:46:17,601 --> 02:46:20,390
is everybody had one of those.
It wouldn't be so dangerous.

3604
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:23,510
The problem is other people have fucking
trucks,

3605
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:26,180
semis and shit.
And you have a prius.

3606
02:46:26,660 --> 02:46:31,610
Prius get hit by a semi.
After I got rear ended,

3607
02:46:31,611 --> 02:46:36,611
man,
I started really reconsidering the type 

3608
02:46:36,611 --> 02:46:38,321
of automobile I drive.
The Porsche took the hit pretty good 

3609
02:46:38,321 --> 02:46:42,851
because it's designed German engineering
and as a crash beam in the back that 

3610
02:46:42,851 --> 02:46:45,020
absorbs the impact,
but I didn't get hit that hard either.

3611
02:46:45,050 --> 02:46:45,860
You know,
you,

3612
02:46:45,900 --> 02:46:48,080
you think about all these fucking idiots
out there.

3613
02:46:48,081 --> 02:46:53,081
Like I told you about van Owen Street,
these caved in cars from assholes that 

3614
02:46:53,081 --> 02:46:55,190
are just texting or sleeping or whatever
the fuck they're doing.

3615
02:46:55,610 --> 02:46:57,800
That's the problem with driving as the 
other people.

3616
02:46:58,180 --> 02:46:59,960
You're dealing with so many variables.

3617
02:47:00,070 --> 02:47:05,070
It's none of them have insurance either.
Half these people on our roads don't 

3618
02:47:05,070 --> 02:47:06,460
even have licenses and insurance,
whatever.

3619
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:08,410
It's brutal out there,
man.

3620
02:47:08,411 --> 02:47:11,610
I'm on a motorcycle and I just couldn't 
laugh like you.

3621
02:47:12,340 --> 02:47:14,020
I'll look right at a guy,
Joe.

3622
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:16,600
I'm riding.
That guy will look at me.

3623
02:47:17,080 --> 02:47:20,800
He'll look like this.
He sees me put his blinker on.

3624
02:47:20,801 --> 02:47:22,990
It just starts coming over.
He doesn't give a fuck.

3625
02:47:23,170 --> 02:47:25,660
Who knows you're going to move.
So I started talking like,

3626
02:47:25,690 --> 02:47:26,950
Hey man,
I'm right here.

3627
02:47:26,951 --> 02:47:29,440
Hey,
and then now we won't look like,

3628
02:47:29,470 --> 02:47:30,910
Oh,
I don't hear you.

3629
02:47:30,911 --> 02:47:33,670
I'm coming over here.
I need this lane,

3630
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:34,720
and they just,

3631
02:47:34,970 --> 02:47:36,800
if they know that they can believe 
that's it,

3632
02:47:36,890 --> 02:47:41,890
they can push you up.
Do you see that video of the guy on the 

3633
02:47:41,890 --> 02:47:42,830
BMW and there's a guy on a motorcycle 
that has a Gopro on his helmet.

3634
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,620
That's unbelievable.
I get off the fucking phone.

3635
02:47:45,621 --> 02:47:46,880
Stay off the phone.
You're driving.

3636
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,980
So then the guy runs them off the road.
Yeah,

3637
02:47:48,981 --> 02:47:53,981
he hits him on purpose.
There's a video of the kid like looking 

3638
02:47:53,981 --> 02:47:54,140
to his left leg and his left foot.
Boom.

3639
02:47:54,290 --> 02:47:54,890
He gets hit

3640
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:56,470
and you just hear and go,
oh,

3641
02:47:56,760 --> 02:47:59,850
oh fuck.
This guy picks him up.

3642
02:47:59,870 --> 02:48:02,080
He's like nine slash 11.
I've been here.

3643
02:48:02,130 --> 02:48:02,600
You know,
it's,

3644
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:07,340
I should find whoever has that fucking 
BMW beat the fucking shit out of him.

3645
02:48:07,350 --> 02:48:10,020
I can't believe that detail man.
What cons?

3646
02:48:10,410 --> 02:48:15,410
What a piece of shit that's a human on a
vehicle easily could have been 

3647
02:48:15,410 --> 02:48:19,711
paralyzed.
He easily could have said easily could 

3648
02:48:19,711 --> 02:48:19,711
have been run over in the other 
direction.

3649
02:48:19,711 --> 02:48:19,711
Yeah,
yeah.

3650
02:48:19,711 --> 02:48:20,890
No,
he loses his job.

3651
02:48:20,891 --> 02:48:25,891
He's got broke legs now and he loses his
house and everything for this fucking 

3652
02:48:25,891 --> 02:48:27,250
Dick that's like,
I gotta get to my job.

3653
02:48:27,310 --> 02:48:32,310
Fuck you.
It wasn't what he was doing it on 

3654
02:48:32,310 --> 02:48:34,441
purpose.
He did it perfect because that guy told 

3655
02:48:34,441 --> 02:48:34,441
him,
get off your phone.

3656
02:48:34,441 --> 02:48:34,441
Yeah.
He first,

3657
02:48:34,441 --> 02:48:35,310
he honks at him.
He goes,

3658
02:48:35,311 --> 02:48:36,430
Hey,
get off your phone.

3659
02:48:36,431 --> 02:48:37,930
And then he pulls up and then the guy 
like,

3660
02:48:37,990 --> 02:48:40,030
oh,
it turns eight bucks.

3661
02:48:40,090 --> 02:48:45,090
Then he starts riding and left.
It looks like he's like Santa,

3662
02:48:45,240 --> 02:48:45,650
Santa Monica.
What?

3663
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:47,950
Berea there.
And then boom,

3664
02:48:47,951 --> 02:48:48,940
the car hits him.

3665
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:51,590
Yeah,
most likely the kid did not have as A.

3666
02:48:51,590 --> 02:48:52,300
Oh,
here it is.

3667
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:54,800
We'll,
we'll end.

3668
02:48:54,801 --> 02:48:59,801
This doesn't have the fucking plate now.
So he really doesn't know how to be a 

3669
02:48:59,801 --> 02:49:01,940
traffic camera or something.
Well,

3670
02:49:01,941 --> 02:49:02,960
one would hope so.
But uh,

3671
02:49:02,961 --> 02:49:06,080
traffic cameras probably most likely not
going to get the.

3672
02:49:06,470 --> 02:49:08,180
This isn't like serious.
What's

3673
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:13,190
on the brand there by Alan?
Nate's says kid keeps looking back 

3674
02:49:14,311 --> 02:49:17,400
because apparently he's like right on 
birthday,

3675
02:49:19,290 --> 02:49:24,210
right in front of coin.
Jesus Christ man.

3676
02:49:24,211 --> 02:49:28,350
So just cut them off.
He just got in front of them.

3677
02:49:29,820 --> 02:49:31,470
Wow,
this guy helps him up.

3678
02:49:32,670 --> 02:49:35,460
You shouldn't help a guy out when he 
announced it like that.

3679
02:49:35,461 --> 02:49:40,461
I know he might be fucked up.
I was furious when I saw visit visit my 

3680
02:49:42,691 --> 02:49:45,180
crowd funding site.
That wasn't the car pulled over.

3681
02:49:45,181 --> 02:49:47,070
The car took off,
took off.

3682
02:49:47,220 --> 02:49:48,840
It was a black beemer.
No,

3683
02:49:48,841 --> 02:49:52,170
it wasn't black right here,
is it?

3684
02:49:52,440 --> 02:49:53,500
No,
it was before that.

3685
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:54,110
It was,
um,

3686
02:49:54,130 --> 02:49:57,010
you could see it before it.
You could see the color before it.

3687
02:49:57,100 --> 02:49:58,840
Before it,
right at the beginning.

3688
02:49:58,900 --> 02:49:59,290
Jamie?

3689
02:50:01,710 --> 02:50:04,190
Yes.
It's a beamer on the left Femur,

3690
02:50:04,250 --> 02:50:07,480
but it looks like it's look like kind of
a gray.

3691
02:50:08,750 --> 02:50:13,750
I can't believe that guy did that.
Anybody knows who did a fucking find 

3692
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:16,610
employees.
That guy needs to be in jail.

3693
02:50:17,450 --> 02:50:19,100
Can't move.
Before you go,

3694
02:50:19,101 --> 02:50:22,340
you got to hear this story.
Joe Gilby Clarke from guns and roses.

3695
02:50:22,730 --> 02:50:27,020
He was hit on his motorcycle on Ventura 
Boulevard about five years ago.

3696
02:50:27,130 --> 02:50:31,010
Got Hits and runs them two years after 
that.

3697
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:36,160
Gilby hospital for the first six months.
Can't walk plates in his legs.

3698
02:50:36,770 --> 02:50:41,770
A cane got hit him and ran.
The guys had a party two years later.

3699
02:50:42,110 --> 02:50:44,060
He's telling the dude,
yeah man,

3700
02:50:44,061 --> 02:50:49,061
Hey,
that guy a couple of years ago on a 

3701
02:50:49,061 --> 02:50:49,061
motorcycle.
I just kept going,

3702
02:50:49,061 --> 02:50:49,430
man,
he's kind of drunk.

3703
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:50,450
I think.
He goes,

3704
02:50:50,451 --> 02:50:51,020
really?
He goes,

3705
02:50:51,021 --> 02:50:53,060
yeah,
over on Ventura Boulevard,

3706
02:50:53,061 --> 02:50:54,170
man.
These bikers.

3707
02:50:54,171 --> 02:50:54,980
Fuck them,
man.

3708
02:50:54,981 --> 02:50:55,640
I mean,
you know,

3709
02:50:55,650 --> 02:50:56,490
he,
he,

3710
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:57,710
he,
I don't know.

3711
02:50:57,830 --> 02:50:59,300
I hit him.
I don't know what happened.

3712
02:50:59,390 --> 02:51:03,170
The guy knew gilby called them.
I guess I got the guy.

3713
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:08,200
He's at this party.
Two years later they sent the police 

3714
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:08,510
over.
It was the dude.

3715
02:51:08,600 --> 02:51:13,600
He told the story at a party,
so this guy is not going to be able to.

3716
02:51:13,851 --> 02:51:15,650
First of all,
he has some damage on his car.

3717
02:51:15,651 --> 02:51:19,460
He hit the bike most likely.
So he's got something on the side of his

3718
02:51:19,461 --> 02:51:20,930
class.
He just bumped the wheel.

3719
02:51:20,990 --> 02:51:21,680
Yeah,
maybe.

3720
02:51:21,681 --> 02:51:23,180
Yeah.
You might have bumped the wheel yet from

3721
02:51:23,181 --> 02:51:28,181
behind.
He's going to tell someone because 

3722
02:51:28,181 --> 02:51:28,580
that's going to weigh on him.
I hope so.

3723
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:30,150
May Too.
What a cunt.

3724
02:51:30,890 --> 02:51:33,710
That's such a scary thing that someone 
could do that to a person.

3725
02:51:33,711 --> 02:51:35,660
Just hit them with a car is fucking 
brutal,

3726
02:51:35,661 --> 02:51:37,750
dude.
You know he was texting.

3727
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:38,940
He didn't realize he did it.
No,

3728
02:51:38,980 --> 02:51:39,430
he didn't.

3729
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,140
He drove on that guy's ass and hit all 
the guy.

3730
02:51:42,141 --> 02:51:44,720
Kept looking like he's coming up on him.
You see his head,

3731
02:51:44,721 --> 02:51:45,250
he's gone.
What,

3732
02:51:45,251 --> 02:51:47,120
what the fuck?
You know?

3733
02:51:47,690 --> 02:51:49,460
Well two things.
One,

3734
02:51:49,461 --> 02:51:52,220
don't start shit with someone that's 
just on their phone.

3735
02:51:52,250 --> 02:51:52,910
Yeah,
he can't do it.

3736
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:54,450
He shouldn't have done that in the first
place.

3737
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:57,080
Not excusing the grind for hitting him 
in the car,

3738
02:51:57,081 --> 02:52:02,081
but you know,
you never know what you're catching 

3739
02:52:02,081 --> 02:52:03,731
someone you can.
You might be catching someone at the 

3740
02:52:03,731 --> 02:52:05,741
fucking verge of a nervous breakdown.
Their wife just broke up with him that 

3741
02:52:05,741 --> 02:52:05,800
she cleaned out the bank.
The fucking.

3742
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:11,040
They got fired at work.
Their dog got poisoned by the neighbor 

3743
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:11,040
or the [inaudible].
Who knows?

3744
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:12,070
Who knows?
And you just,

3745
02:52:12,100 --> 02:52:13,110
you know,
fuck you.

3746
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:15,540
Get off your phone.
What the fuck did you know?

3747
02:52:15,580 --> 02:52:17,860
You're catching someone at nine touch 
the button.

3748
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:19,090
Exactly.
Don't do it.

3749
02:52:19,810 --> 02:52:21,460
Be Nice.
Flux.

3750
02:52:21,710 --> 02:52:23,780
And this city is also filled with 
gangsters.

3751
02:52:23,900 --> 02:52:28,900
I mean,
let's be half these people are on your 

3752
02:52:28,900 --> 02:52:28,900
mind.
Probably murdered.

3753
02:52:28,900 --> 02:52:29,180
People add their packing.

3754
02:52:29,340 --> 02:52:34,340
Well,
how many people out there just so angry 

3755
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:34,340
and frustrated too?
Yeah,

3756
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:34,620
I didn't get that role.
Fuck him.

3757
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:37,770
Just everything.
I mean there's 20 million people.

3758
02:52:37,771 --> 02:52:39,690
You're dealing with way too many human 
beings.

3759
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:45,000
You're dealing with all sorts of fucking
economic problems and who knows what 

3760
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,621
else and relationship shit.
There's an episode of Radiolab that I'm 

3761
02:52:48,961 --> 02:52:53,961
listening to right now where it talks 
about people that were going to kill 

3762
02:52:53,961 --> 02:52:55,690
somebody that almost we're going to kill
somebody now.

3763
02:52:55,710 --> 02:53:00,710
How prevalent it is.
This woman was talking about this ex 

3764
02:53:00,710 --> 02:53:01,260
boyfriend that she had that was 
blackmailing her and said,

3765
02:53:01,261 --> 02:53:02,910
you can't,
if you have another boyfriend,

3766
02:53:02,911 --> 02:53:07,911
I'm going to fucking tell them and I'm 
going to send them sex tapes that we 

3767
02:53:07,911 --> 02:53:10,680
made together and was saying that I want
to haunt you for the rest of your life.

3768
02:53:10,830 --> 02:53:15,830
So she invited the guy over her house 
and she was cooking dinner for him and 

3769
02:53:15,830 --> 02:53:15,830
she was going to stab him.
Whoa.

3770
02:53:15,870 --> 02:53:20,870
And she had the knife in her hand.
The Guy ran away and they asked her 

3771
02:53:20,870 --> 02:53:20,870
like,
how close were you stabbing him?

3772
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:23,790
She was like 60 percent,
60 percent established.

3773
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:25,710
She was thinking,
if this guy wasn't in my life,

3774
02:53:25,740 --> 02:53:30,740
I could be happy,
and so she was just going to stab him 

3775
02:53:30,740 --> 02:53:34,311
like she was so maniacal about.
And you've got to think how many people 

3776
02:53:34,311 --> 02:53:34,311
get that close.
Yeah,

3777
02:53:34,311 --> 02:53:36,510
but this is a normal person who got that
close.

3778
02:53:36,550 --> 02:53:37,410
They got that close.

3779
02:53:37,480 --> 02:53:41,480
That's crazy because then the,
the next five minutes,

3780
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:43,640
your whole life changes and you go to 
prison.

3781
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:44,850
You know,

3782
02:53:45,450 --> 02:53:47,940
I would give her a free pass.
I'd give her a pass.

3783
02:53:48,170 --> 02:53:53,170
You guys a con?
He's trying to fucking say she could 

3784
02:53:53,170 --> 02:53:53,170
never have a boyfriend again.
He's going to send the out.

3785
02:53:53,170 --> 02:53:57,920
That ruining her life.
Apparently he was according to her 

3786
02:53:57,920 --> 02:53:58,890
vicious asshole.
If you're a woman,

3787
02:53:58,891 --> 02:54:03,891
man,
this the shit that you have to deal 

3788
02:54:03,891 --> 02:54:05,361
with.
It's not that much different than a lot 

3789
02:54:05,361 --> 02:54:05,361
of ways that,
that kind of bullying,

3790
02:54:05,361 --> 02:54:07,980
that kind of physical,
frightening shit.

3791
02:54:08,560 --> 02:54:11,130
It's a lot like someone in a car hitting
someone on a bike.

3792
02:54:11,360 --> 02:54:13,920
It's like you can get away with it,
you know you can get away with it.

3793
02:54:13,921 --> 02:54:14,950
So you do.
What are you thinking?

3794
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:16,590
That moment,
at least you can get away with it.

3795
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:21,800
That's the con deist aspect of people 
victimizing other people when they can 

3796
02:54:21,800 --> 02:54:25,241
get away with it.
Like that black male is the garbage of 

3797
02:54:25,241 --> 02:54:27,831
America,
which didn't have any violence in like 

3798
02:54:27,831 --> 02:54:28,140
that.
Especially in relationship violence.

3799
02:54:28,350 --> 02:54:29,850
It's a scary shit,
man.

3800
02:54:30,210 --> 02:54:35,210
That's what cops always say.
It's the scariest thing for them when 

3801
02:54:35,210 --> 02:54:35,210
they show up.
Domestic violence.

3802
02:54:35,210 --> 02:54:35,210
Yeah.
Wait,

3803
02:54:35,210 --> 02:54:36,540
what'd you say about black guys?
They sound what?

3804
02:54:36,541 --> 02:54:37,440
He said,
man.

3805
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:38,760
Black male,
bro.

3806
02:54:39,160 --> 02:54:41,370
No,
black man.

3807
02:54:44,020 --> 02:54:46,070
Eric,
a black band.

3808
02:54:49,020 --> 02:54:54,020
Brian was Brian Band on Ferguson.
