1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,310
I get,
I get heavy,

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,140
you know,
I'm going to talk about life and death.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,400
You talking about life
around.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,310
That is what we're doing.
We're living in.

5
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,470
Some people were dying.
That's life and death.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,870
We're all.
What's really interesting is that we're

7
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:20,280
all going to die.
Yes.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,460
And,
and that everybody pushes away and I

9
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:30,420
guess that's normal to push away,
you know,

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,360
thoughts of your death,
but the real enlightened,

11
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:36,780
like the Buddhist Buddhism,
eastern eastern and stuff,

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,810
they say the way to get enlightened is
to die if you can check this out,

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,450
is to die before you die.
Meaning lately kind of go into the fear

14
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:56,490
and they claim that the fear is
releasing ego,

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,520
which what they mean by ego is like,
like you have this beautiful studio and

16
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:05,340
you have a career and a wife and a kid.
Kids I guess.

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,960
And,
and it's like,

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,820
it's like you can't be attached to it.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,940
You have to die to that.
Like in other words,

20
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,550
you don't own your wife,
you don't own

21
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,030
anything really,
because we're just,

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,250
we're.
The bottom line of it is,

23
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:29,760
is we are temporary,
yes and impermanent.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,420
And it doesn't mean you can't enjoy,
you know,

25
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,690
like you're in the prime of your life.
Right?

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,720
So why think about your fucking death,
you know what I mean?

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,570
But I think for guys like me,
I'm a little older and like for some

28
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,580
reason we're on,
right?

29
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,390
Yeah.
For some reason I experienced panic

30
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:55,740
attacks,
um,

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,930
and I had a full blown one coming up
here while you're driving.

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,640
Wow.
I was driving.

33
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:05,400
I now will feel like,
okay,

34
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,280
this is what it feels like is,
um,

35
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,620
I'm feeling kind of tired.
I've been doing a lot.

36
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:12,080
And that's not to brag.
I,

37
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:12,990
I've been,
I've been

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,490
in show business.
What?

39
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,960
You're in show business.
I'm in show business.

40
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,490
You're doing a lot of work.
I'm in show business,

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,500
I'm married,
I have two dogs,

42
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,500
I have three cats.
It's a,

43
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,860
it's like to manage the dogs are,
are,

44
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,360
are,
are intense,

45
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,370
you know,
because you,

46
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,580
I love your dog.
I've talked to have three.

47
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,563
You have three?
Yeah.

48
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,700
Okay.
But for me,

49
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,810
uh,
and this is,

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,210
I think one of my,
one of the,

51
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,810
uh,
you know why I'm a panic attack,

52
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,640
suffer occasionally.
His Dad,

53
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,730
I get into these dogs like I,
I think I'm a sign of someone who has

54
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:58,641
panic attacks,
is someone who cares too much about care

55
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:03,160
of things instead of trusting that
everything's gonna be alright.

56
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,990
Like I to get up,
I'm going to feed the dogs.

57
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:08,230
The dogs will be okay.
I'm always like doing stuff like,

58
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,430
hey,
my dog's name is Charlotte and Basil

59
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:12,700
Charlotte.

60
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,230
Does she have something in the Charlotte
or something in a right?

61
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,860
And I blow it up a little,
you know what I mean?

62
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,470
Instead of chilling and going,
oh,

63
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,760
she'll be okay.
Let me just,

64
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,080
let me just,
you know,

65
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,290
wipe the.
I'll see her like scratching at the

66
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,350
aisle and it can set me off into this
worry and I think that's kind of um,

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,280
the symptom of panic attacks.
Like I'm coming up here,

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,310
so I get on the one on one.
People who don't know the one on one.

69
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,730
Well you should just kill yourself
because the one on one is a main artery

70
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,050
and you should know about it or what if
they don't drive cars,

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,290
thing.
Other things to worry about.

72
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,560
I think they're brilliant if they don't
drive a.

73
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,050
But anyway,
it,

74
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,630
it was packed.
It was,

75
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,450
you know,
the Google maps was like accidents up

76
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:06,451
ahead and I started to feel this kind of
feeling trapped.

77
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,840
Have you ever felt trapped on the
highway where,

78
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,900
uh,
and,

79
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:17,770
and for some reason I think because I'm
overtired and I wanted to get here,

80
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:20,260
this is first time I've done your
podcast,

81
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,740
I just started feeling an anxiety about,
oh fuck,

82
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,990
I'm going to be.
And this is what happened.

83
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,750
I mean,
I'm doing it physically feeling I'm

84
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,920
going to be late,
I'm going to have the walls are closing

85
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,300
in.
Yes man,

86
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,340
right?
Yes.

87
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,350
The real scary thing is the breath.
Like,

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,500
oh man.
It's like I'm this,

89
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,190
I'm doing it in the car.
And by the way,

90
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:44,350
the one thing I hate about La,
I don't know about you,

91
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:49,351
but like here we are in December 28th
and it's hot.

92
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,640
Yeah,
it's pretty warm.

93
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,570
It's like 75 degrees.
80.

94
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:57,610
Is it 80 to 80 and the sun is blaring
in,

95
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:02,611
through by side window.
And I'm feeling a little fuck.

96
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,260
There's nowhere.
I just don't,

97
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,580
where I can't get off,
I can't,

98
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,760
you know what I mean?
It's,

99
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,673
it's,
um,

100
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,180
so it's a buildup of anxiety instead of
just going,

101
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,130
you know,
what,

102
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,760
like your shirt,
let that shit go.

103
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,200
Let that shit go.
I,

104
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,120
I,
I couldn't,

105
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,960
I couldn't let it go.
Like when I get entangled in it,

106
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,880
when it reaches a tipping point.
Right.

107
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,720
You know,
when,

108
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,430
when the anxiety reaches a tipping point
where,

109
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,910
you know,
I,

110
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,280
I am like,
Oh God,

111
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,010
like,
like here's the voice in my head that I

112
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,360
have to always battle.
It's like,

113
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,820
Oh God,
this isn't going to work out instead of,

114
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,740
hey,
you know,

115
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,960
for some reason I have the.
Oh God,

116
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,270
okay.
But you intellectualize it,

117
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:46,601
right?
Like,

118
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:51,220
like now like we're talking about,
but now now it's after it's over,

119
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,540
you realize like,
ah,

120
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,950
I should just say,
hey,

121
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,350
let that shit go like you without any
stake in the game.

122
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,590
Right.
You removed.

123
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:57,980
If you were

124
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,950
giving yourself advice in that car,
he'd be like to come on.

125
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,170
I really think it's great.
You're living in America.

126
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:07,040
Here is few extra people on the road.
Some of them bumped into each other.

127
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,720
Let's just get through this.
You know,

128
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:10,130
you texted me.
It's no problem.

129
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,960
Come a little later.
It's no big deal.

130
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,640
Start a little later.
It's casual.

131
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,520
There's no,
no reason to get anxious about that.

132
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,640
Where I don't smoke pot too.
Did I would understand more because

133
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,640
people that eat edibles and then get on
the one on one and get stuck in traffic

134
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,580
and then what happens?
Here's your whole world starts closing

135
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:31,470
in on you.
You started without the adipose.

136
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,440
Yeah.
It's the same kind of thing.

137
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,350
It's A.
I think one of the things that I've

138
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:39,860
noticed a lot is a lot of people that
have anxiety and a lot of people that

139
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,520
they're generally,
they're intelligent people and the

140
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:46,790
problem is with intelligent people is
that you're overwhelmed with

141
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,720
possibilities.

142
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,540
You're thinking about all the actual
variables that are in play.

143
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,350
Whereas dumb people just fucking stumble
into walls where they're talking on

144
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:57,230
their phone and you know,
they're like texting and walking out

145
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,030
into traffic.
They're not thinking,

146
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,560
you know,
somehow they get things work out for

147
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,120
them.
It doesn't snow illusion.

148
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:08,870
You're not living in their skin.
If you were inside the nine volt battery

149
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:09,830
brain,
you'd be like,

150
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:12,200
Oh God,
this is fucking nothing to think about

151
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:15,140
here.
Like was it Jamie?

152
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:17,990
Will you with me or is it with Tony when
we're at the airport and there's this

153
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:20,720
girl.
I sat next to her just to listen to our

154
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,990
conversation.
I think it was Tony and she was just

155
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:28,991
talking about amazing race and I wanted
this team to win and I can't wait until

156
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:34,190
this happens and when I get paid on
Friday I'm going to buy this phone and

157
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:38,330
then there's this is this food I really
want to eat and it was just this

158
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,260
droning.

159
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,750
I'm like,
this might.

160
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,970
You might as well be a robot that just
sent here to consume.

161
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:48,971
There's no like there was no.
There was no curiosity or creativity.

162
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:54,311
It was just consumption.
It was just food and buy this and watch

163
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:59,331
that and and drone on and on and on,
and who knows if it's genetics,

164
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,060
if it's nature or nurture or whatever it
is.

165
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:06,340
There's a lot of really dull folks out
there and we're not supposed to do just

166
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,240
a lot of really told folks,
but the culture is also geared to

167
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,930
consumption.
I mean a lot of it is sure,

168
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,850
isn't it?
It's like it's like you turn on the

169
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:20,660
fucking TV and that is the message
center that our culture,

170
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,270
that is our culture.
It's a part of our culture,

171
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:26,380
but our culture is pretty vast now.
I would say that one,

172
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,310
much more of our culture,
the Internet much more than than

173
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,000
mainstream media now and that's one of
the reasons why they're grasping at

174
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,560
straws,
trying to stay relevant.

175
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,520
What the mainstream media like
television shows there.

176
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:42,521
They're down record numbers like news is
down record number to be about that.

177
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,530
Yeah,
I mean I think it the idea that these.

178
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,400
It's great if someone is like,
you know,

179
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:51,500
New York Times,
Time magazine,

180
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,560
respected journalism,
someone who you can go to when you

181
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:56,010
really want to.
What the fuck

182
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,910
is happening in Syria?
I need to know,

183
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:59,190
oh,
I need to know from someone who's going

184
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:01,620
to give me an objective informed
opinion.

185
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,330
That's,
that's huge.

186
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,360
And it's very critical,
but once you get past that you're

187
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,030
dealing a lot of the shows you're
dealing with,

188
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,870
whether it's CNN or Fox News,
you're dealing with opinions and your

189
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:15,990
opinion is just as valid as Shepard
Smith's.

190
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,820
Like why?
Why is Shepard Smith?

191
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,730
Because he has makeup on and he's
wearing a tie and they have ready,

192
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:23,190
set,
go and they press the green light and

193
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,170
what you're talking about is really
interesting.

194
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,580
How,
how?

195
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:31,581
Because it's just on TV because it's
sanction sanction to sanction by the

196
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:36,930
powers that be like,
like it's really about ownership.

197
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,780
Like,
like I don't even know who owned CNN

198
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:42,390
anymore.
So was it Ted Turner?

199
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,520
He probably still owns it.
He's Hashtag Ball.

200
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,190
He was right?
I think so.

201
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:52,820
I mean he's like one of the biggest land
owners in the United States.

202
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,260
He has millions of acres.
Yes,

203
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,100
he owns buffalo.
Got Restaurants were served buffalo.

204
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,910
Unbelievable.
Hashtag ball.

205
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,050
Is that Montana?
Think it's called Montana.

206
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,470
Yeah,
it's in Montana,

207
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,440
right?
You have them in Colorado.

208
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,590
They might've been Montana as well.
I think it's actually a chain.

209
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,720
I don't know where they are,
but it's supposed to be very good

210
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:17,130
restaurant,
but what my point was is that the

211
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:19,050
structure at CNN says,
well,

212
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,480
we're going to talk about this,
we're going to talk about that.

213
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:23,850
We're going to talk about that.
We're going to put it on TV and people

214
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:26,160
watch the fuck.
You know,

215
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:29,550
you have to break it down to the
essential is like there is a screen,

216
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:34,290
it's being transmitted into your,
into your home.

217
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,050
It's been and it's,
it's very much,

218
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,080
it's very much with people not realizing
it a complete fucking mind control thing

219
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,070
or it really influences you and it takes
a lot to kind of disconnect and,

220
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,950
and for instance,
I have said to myself,

221
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:57,570
I am going to disconnect from the grid
for a while.

222
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,770
You ever tried to do that?
Like,

223
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,950
I'm not going to go online.
I'm not going to watch TV.

224
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,570
Like,
you know what I mean,

225
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:07,230
but it's,
it's really kind of very difficult.

226
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,750
Might go somewhere.
I go hunting.

227
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,780
That's what I do.
I go to the woods for like a week and I

228
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:15,000
have no choice.
Can't get cell phone signal.

229
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,620
Can just,
no Internet connection.

230
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,160
Do you feel rejuvenated?
Well,

231
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,850
yeah,
it feels good.

232
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,580
It feels good to take breaks.
You know,

233
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,870
I,
I enjoyed the Internet.

234
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,080
I enjoy the information,
but it's overwhelming and one of the

235
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:29,700
reasons why it's overwhelming is we're
not,

236
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,040
we're not really accustomed to this
experience.

237
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,170
This is a very new experience for human
beings.

238
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,880
Like over the last,
you know,

239
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,990
20 years we've options to a little bit
more.

240
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,570
Twenty four,
I think 94 ish really came up.

241
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,410
Ninety four is when I got online.
Don't you sink and I really want to

242
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,680
relate to this again,
just like cut to the panic attack.

243
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:51,390
I drove it up here.
It's because this is,

244
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,410
it's another form of,
of the anxiety

245
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,100
that it's information overload.
Overload.

246
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,180
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

247
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,420
Because my brain,
my brain,

248
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,470
I think your brain is the same way.
It's like my brain,

249
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,560
I feel my brain just digging into shit
like,

250
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,850
oh,
you know,

251
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:13,170
like I'll read a paragraph on,
I don't fucking know.

252
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,340
Hunting and then you know,
it'll mention something about guns and

253
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:20,610
then I go to guns and then I go to gun
control.

254
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,790
Like go,
I go and then I go to the scumbags who

255
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,730
don't want gun control and then I go to
a school shooting,

256
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,430
like one thing leads to another on the
internet,

257
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:34,420
rabbit holes,
rabbit holes to go down that rabbit

258
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,180
hole.
I was,

259
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,180
I want to do more of this on stage,
but like talking to an audience about,

260
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:43,450
Hey,
I've only done it once and it went over

261
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,231
care.
Okay.

262
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,810
But it was like,
hey,

263
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:49,750
you ever get a,
you ever go on facebook and you just

264
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,460
start reading a fee.

265
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,490
You just start reading your feed and you
just get drawn into like people's random

266
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,220
thoughts.
You start connecting into their brains

267
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,211
and you're like,
oh,

268
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:06,910
I get that.
And then where you go wrong is there's

269
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,510
262 comments wound.
You read the comments and you their

270
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:12,910
feeds,
you know,

271
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:17,380
but after you fucking let's say 30
comments in.

272
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,920
Yeah,
something happens to your fucking

273
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:25,900
center.
Like your brain just Kinda is free

274
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,970
forming it about.
I forget what,

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,811
what,
what?

276
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,340
Um,
what I was.

277
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,020
Oh,
I was reading this was a,

278
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,250
this was some threads.
Somebody started this guy said,

279
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,760
improv comedy.
Improv is bullshit.

280
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,540
It's halfassed.
It's um,

281
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,280
it's,
you know,

282
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,880
amateurish.
It's like they're presenting a product

283
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:51,340
that hasn't been chiseled and worked
out.

284
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,810
Whereas standup,
he was,

285
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,480
he was a proponent of Stanford and he
said,

286
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,860
stand up,
you know,

287
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,870
it's,
it's chiseled and what people want is a

288
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:02,860
finished product.

289
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,630
And I,
you know,

290
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,920
I,
I kinda,

291
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,540
I disagreed.
I mean,

292
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,940
I love different things at different
things.

293
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,060
So it's like some people enjoy jazz.
Yes.

294
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,890
That's what I love.
Yeah.

295
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:17,020
They,
some people enjoy symphonies,

296
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,670
some people like to go to see an
orchestra.

297
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,550
They want to say everything that's been
perfectly tuned and,

298
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,880
and just gotten to this point of
perfection where they were great.

299
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,370
Great too.
It's all.

300
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,560
Look,
it's great to watch someone's finished

301
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:30,580
set.
Yeah.

302
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,980
I loved watching your thing about how
America is now a whore and we're driving

303
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:38,980
with trump like you,
you did that thing with up.

304
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,340
But I do my bit and
no,

305
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,210
but,
but here's the thing is that you get

306
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:51,720
sucked in because the way the guy on the
Internet,

307
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:52,070
and this is what

308
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,900
happens on the Internet a lot,
the way they guy who said Improv socks,

309
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,240
that's how we framed it.
This sucks,

310
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,380
this is good.
And then it's a thing that then your,

311
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,580
then your ego gets involved.
Like I think I even know I didn't engage

312
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:08,840
in that one,
which is really good.

313
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,940
Here's the thing,
he's right to him.

314
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,011
For him.
He's right.

315
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:14,210
It's just,
he phrased it wrong.

316
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,330
If you said the what I like is standup
because I'm like a polished product.

317
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't like Improv because it feels
amateurish to me and people could say I

318
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:25,400
disagree.
I love Improv because it's wild.

319
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:28,040
I like that feeling of being in the
audience where someone yells out,

320
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,240
you know,
genre,

321
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,480
World War Two films and you know,
that they're,

322
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:34,760
they're scrambling and they fucking try
to pretend they're into the,

323
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,420
in the,
what's that called?

324
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,580
The tunnels for trenches trenches.

325
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,360
I,
yeah,

326
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,000
I,
I build trenches and I have mustard gas

327
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:48,410
at home.
It's grey.

328
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:50,660
Poupon mustard gas,
grey poupon,

329
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:52,820
mustard gas.
I think that,

330
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,380
uh,
there's nothing wrong with having

331
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,840
opinions on things,
but people don't like that.

332
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:59,200
Your opinions are different than theirs
and they get mad at you.

333
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,850
Like some people get mad at you if you
like a certain kind of music.

334
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,880
It's crazy.
But they'll get mad.

335
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:05,960
Like,
your tastes sucks.

336
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,000
You're tasting music sucks.
But here's the thing.

337
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,770
What we're talking about is that that's
what's going on a lot on the internet.

338
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,220
Yeah,
you suck,

339
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,170
you suck,
you suck,

340
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,480
you're wrong,
you're wrong,

341
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:17,990
you're wrong.
Definitely wrong.

342
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,370
And,
and I think it's really reached a fuck

343
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:26,371
in a heightened state because of the
politics in the country.

344
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,930
Like another words,
it,

345
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,130
it filters down to where the president
stands up with the president insults

346
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:34,370
people constantly.

347
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,270
That's all he does.
That's what he's a divisive.

348
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,620
You know what I mean?
This is not new,

349
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:42,170
but that's how he,
he operates.

350
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,770
He's very manipulative in the fact that
he usually,

351
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,130
he's very praising of some people,
you know,

352
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,840
like doing an amazing job.
Beautiful job.

353
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,260
The other day he was talking about these
firefighters and he had all these

354
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,320
firefighters behind him and he was
talking about what a great job they're

355
00:16:57,321 --> 00:17:00,470
doing as firefighters and it's just like
this weird speech and now going to go

356
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:01,850
see each other on tv and like,
you know,

357
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,900
I don't think they get enough credit and
so he'll,

358
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,450
he'll like bestow.
It's very interesting method course is

359
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,820
going to bestow preys on the
firefighters.

360
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,210
You would say that right.
But only if it's convenient for him.

361
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,300
Like about John Mccain who was a fucking
war hero.

362
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,640
He was like,
I like people that don't get captured

363
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,050
like Jesus Christ.

364
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,240
Like he had like six deferments.
Like,

365
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,390
Yo,
I had a hangnail,

366
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,800
like I can't go to war.
He had a gang of deferments and

367
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,720
meanwhile he's saying something about
John fucking mccain who a legitimate war

368
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:37,721
hero who was captured and tortured by
the Viet Cong and he had the balls to

369
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:39,470
say,
I like people that have been.

370
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,050
I mean that's effecting the military at
all.

371
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,410
Didn't.
No,

372
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,240
but here's the question.
Has He get away with that?

373
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:47,630
Shit just does because this just who he
is.

374
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,910
It's like if you look,
if you know someone's a scumbag,

375
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,450
like then the scumbag behavior is like,
wow,

376
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,430
that's fucking,
that's Mike.

377
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
That's what he does.
Right?

378
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,140
But if Mike is a priest and it turns out
and what Mike really likes doing is

379
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,820
smoking crack and below and guys,
you know,

380
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:06,720
you find out,
you're like,

381
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,160
oh Jesus,
Mike,

382
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,970
I thought you were this other thing,
but if Mike is Andy Dick and you found

383
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:14,520
out how many dicks out there smoking
crack and blowing guys like,

384
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,960
oh andy,
it's trump is Andy Dick.

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,910
He's
who he is.

386
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,270
He,
that's his thing is you come after him,

387
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,510
he comes after you.
And we just sort of assumed that once he

388
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:30,540
became president he would stop doing
that and he would act hashtag

389
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,760
presidential.
He's not at all.

390
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,560
No,
he can't help himself making it all

391
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:38,880
about himself.
And it's interesting.

392
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,820
Back to the Internet Shit.
And what is going on?

393
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,321
Uh,
you know,

394
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:46,230
just for instance,
taking that example of Improv,

395
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,510
stand up is the best,
right?

396
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,290
It is.
The guy who wrote Improv sucks.

397
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,124
The Guy,
you know,

398
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,060
the guy who started the thread,
it's like,

399
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,520
it's like what they're doing and what
trump is doing.

400
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,640
It's like
shit is all about what I think and I

401
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,340
know you're gonna come at me,
but that's what I want.

402
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,830
I want,
you know,

403
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:12,120
the attention.
I mean,

404
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:16,770
I really think it comes down to I want
to fight.

405
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,710
I wanna fight,
you know,

406
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,330
I want an ego fight.
I wanna fight and I want the attention.

407
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,810
There's certainly a little bit of that,
but I also think she wants repercussions

408
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:30,510
for challenging him.
He wants people to feel he wants to

409
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:32,430
punish him.
He wants people to feel very

410
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:35,640
uncomfortable if they challenge him,
I think that's a big part of his game.

411
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,280
You know?
And he wants everyone to know that he's

412
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:40,500
going to come after you,
like as the president,

413
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:41,760
he's going to come after you.
And if he does,

414
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,040
all the trumpkins are gonna come after
you too.

415
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,870
Because if he comes after you,
then all of these,

416
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,050
these puppets,
these people that follow him that

417
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:52,230
literally are on there all day long,
like you really have to realize that

418
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,340
some of the people that are online that
are tweeting for trump or treating about

419
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,100
certain things,
whether it's on there all day,

420
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,160
by the way,
I'll follow people just to see how crazy

421
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,430
they are just to get it in my head like,
oh,

422
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:05,790
okay.

423
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,590
I see what you do.
You do this all day.

424
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,310
You,
you,

425
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,640
you start tweeting at 7:30 in the
morning with your first cup of coffee.

426
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:15,450
You're hurling insults and you do it til
1:00 in the morning and then you start

427
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,310
all over again in the morning.
How did they do that?

428
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:20,790
Because their credit go insane.
I find,

429
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,630
I don't know about you,
but if I spend an hour on that kind of

430
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:29,631
rabbit hole with twitter or facebook at
my limit,

431
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,290
I think is about an hour before I.
it.

432
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,600
It just something says to me,
I need to,

433
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,940
I need to get out.
I need to walk,

434
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:41,160
I need to do,
do something.

435
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:43,500
I need to get away,
you know what I think is happening in

436
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:44,880
this,
I've been thinking about this a lot over

437
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:49,881
the last week.
I think humanity is in the process of an

438
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,630
overwhelming transformation that
something like giving birth.

439
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,720
I agree and I think that like if you
ever watched someone give birth,

440
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,840
like the crazy thing is how much,
how much pain the women are in.

441
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,060
Like when I watched my daughter come out
of my wife,

442
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,260
I was like,
Whoa,

443
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:09,310
that's a lot of work.
Like it's fucking painful and it's crazy

444
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,144
and they're talking about

445
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,860
blood in.
It's just,

446
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,600
it's not even the president at birth,
it's like this.

447
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:16,840
It's like,
ah,

448
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,050
but then boom.
Did you film it most unbelievable love

449
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:23,250
comes out of it.
Yes I did.

450
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,620
But the most unbelievable love comes out
of it.

451
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,190
And then it's like,
oh my God,

452
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:28,890
and the way you feel is incredible.
And it's like,

453
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:33,450
I think there's a,
you got to go through hell to figure out

454
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,700
how to,
how to handle this better.

455
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:39,630
And I think culturally we're going
through a weird kind of hell in this

456
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,610
kind of health.
Avoidable look,

457
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:45,390
you could just put that phone down and
you can just go hiking,

458
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,370
go with a good friend,
bring your dog,

459
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,860
go have a nice day.
Sit Up there,

460
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,470
you know,
crack open a cold glass of water and

461
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:54,540
look over at the landscape and go,
man,

462
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,180
it's fucking beautiful and it does
something to you when you look at

463
00:21:57,181 --> 00:21:58,110
beautiful things,
right?

464
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,840
You can do that,
but you might want to just check your

465
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,850
twitter real quick.
See if anybody respond to that real

466
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:04,230
witty posts that you left there.
Oh,

467
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:05,820
they get any likes?
Oh fuck you.

468
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:07,350
I didn't say that.
That's not what I meant.

469
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,860
And then he and then he start the wheels
start turning.

470
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,080
Exactly.
You know,

471
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,730
they did a study.
I don't know if you're heard about this

472
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:17,600
one,
that just turning off the phone.

473
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,030
Like if you have the phone in the room
with you and you turn it off,

474
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:23,930
you think,
okay,

475
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,370
the phone's turned off.
I'm cool.

476
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,580
What the scientists said it was a study.
I'm not sure where the study was,

477
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,890
but they said,
no,

478
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,340
no,
no.

479
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,450
You have to put the fucking phone out of
into another room.

480
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,730
They said something about someone's call
you.

481
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,840
What if you get a text or if someone
sends you off,

482
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,590
but what if there's a cool instagram
posts that you'd miss?

483
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,993
Absolutely.

484
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,920
Like
everybody's worried about,

485
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,810
I think does all the chaos that's going
on the world now.

486
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:56,811
A really thing that we're in this
unbelievably tumultuous time in human

487
00:22:57,511 --> 00:23:01,380
history at.
We're not designed to have access to

488
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,620
information 24 slash seven like we do.
It's all about information.

489
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,810
It's connection and information.
Those two things,

490
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,130
those two things are critical.
It's all about information,

491
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,400
but I think even more like insidious is
the way the information is given.

492
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:23,881
Like here you got our president just
basically like a prick the way he

493
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:30,390
fucking hates this year,
but he takes pride in it,

494
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,950
right?
That's part of who he is.

495
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,390
Said say it's regular guy.
See what if you're a regular guy and

496
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:41,430
you're a media figure,
like a some fucking.

497
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,460
Who's the guy from American idol was
that guy's that mean Guy Simon,

498
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,910
that guy like he's a dick.
You know,

499
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:50,810
everybody knows he's a Dick.

500
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,930
Like that's the brand that was trump's
brande.

501
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,610
You're fired.
That was his brand.

502
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,700
So it's reinforced with public
acceptance.

503
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,370
It was reinforced with the tension.
It was reinforced with like,

504
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,630
he knew that that is what got him the
credit,

505
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,070
that he is so gravely desired.
And so then that allowed him to run for

506
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:10,850
president.
Right.

507
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,980
He runs for president.
Yeah.

508
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,380
Coming off of a reality show,
they canceled his fucking reality show

509
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:18,230
while he was running for president.
Remember I taught Schwartzenegger took

510
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:19,064
it over?
No,

511
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,210
they canceled it because he was the pr
because he was running for president.

512
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,940
He was saying things about Mexicans.
Then Swartz,

513
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:27,260
nigger took it over,
but his.

514
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,410
They fired him,
I should say and can't say,

515
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,580
but they fired him.
NBC fired him from the show because the

516
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:35,210
things that he was saying about Mexicans
and that's really where it all came

517
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:35,720
from.

518
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,120
So he was a fucking literally an on TV
reality star on a,

519
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,640
on a shitty game show.
And then from there it goes on to be

520
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:45,930
president.
So that style of car,

521
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,190
he's not going to like have this moment
of reflection.

522
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:50,810
At seven years old we realized this has
all been a terrible.

523
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,500
Like I have this amazing responsibility.
Now I'm in charge of the greatest

524
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,150
nuclear.
Yeah,

525
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,920
you think you would,
but why would he?

526
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,040
Because he's just a person.
I think we have these narratives in our

527
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:05,210
head that these people become heroes.
That a president is something different

528
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:06,710
than a person.
Yeah.

529
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,390
Well I would just think to that if that.
Yeah,

530
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:14,660
I get who he is,
but it's like God damn it.

531
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,460
Don't you get also influenced and formed
by that,

532
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,280
by that way of the job.
Like yes,

533
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,570
you do have,
and this is the scary point.

534
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,960
You do have a nuclear arsenal at your
disposal.

535
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,990
Edit his fucking dangerous because you
know you're dealing with another fucking

536
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:38,480
lunatic.
You know what I mean?

537
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,190
Crazy.
Yeah.

538
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
I mean they found each other.
You know what I mean?

539
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:45,350
I mean,
it's kind of a love story.

540
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,131
Yeah.
Well,

541
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:50,900
in a way there's an argument and this is
the argument that a guy like trump is

542
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:55,901
actually good in this situation because
a guy who is too diplomatic and it would

543
00:25:57,111 --> 00:26:02,111
allow this guy to develop real long
range nuclear capabilities that it'd be

544
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:08,561
extremely dangerous and that with a guy
who was harassing him and fucking with

545
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:12,500
him like the way trump does,
and then you allow the military to do

546
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:17,000
something to stop this guy from
developing these long range nuclear

547
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:22,001
capabilities that this would be better
than having some very wishy washy

548
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:24,540
president who,
uh,

549
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,290
put,
put severe restrictions in the military

550
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,670
and didn't allow them to stop this guy.
We would all like to think that the

551
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:36,671
world is like we are here.
We are here in the United States for the

552
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,660
most part.
Pretty safe.

553
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,000
Not a bad place to be.
You know,

554
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:44,130
most neighborhoods,
even in bad neighborhoods,

555
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:49,130
most of the time it's not that bad.
Occasionally bad shit happens regularly.

556
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:51,480
Bad Shit happens,
but not like it happens in the Congo,

557
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,180
you know,
not like it happens in Syria right now.

558
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,150
Not like Aleppo,
not like all these other other parts of

559
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:59,460
the world that are in constant turmoil.
Libya,

560
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,310
go to Libya right now.
It's fucking Kate.

561
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:03,780
It's a failed state.
It's an isis hotbed,

562
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,400
right?
There's parts of the world that are just

563
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:10,401
fucked and if you're not the kind of
person that is willing to do something

564
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,300
to protect the rest of the people from
getting involved in the kind of chaos.

565
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:21,000
It's in those parts of the world.
That stuff can leak over.

566
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Bad people can come in to your neck of
the woods and start treating where you

567
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:30,630
live.
Exactly how they treat Syria.

568
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,050
Exactly how they treat the Congo.
It's totally possible.

569
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,280
Absolutely.
But I'm a believer that if this bad

570
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,770
stuff,
and it is what you're talking about,

571
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:45,771
what you you mentioned is horrific
stuff.

572
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,510
Like if you go in,
I mean Aleppo,

573
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,610
if you've seen pictures of it,
it's.

574
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,170
It literally is a wasteland and now it
has been a lot of palm doubt.

575
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,750
Yeah.
You know,

576
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,900
and the suffering that those people have
endured and the amount of refugees in

577
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:07,950
the world has gone up and up and up to
me.

578
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,670
I don't think you can isolate that.
I really don't.

579
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:15,390
I,
I think that has to come back to roost

580
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,060
in some ways and it does.
I mean,

581
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:21,510
it's kind of random incidents of
terrorism.

582
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,320
In other words,
what I'm saying is that we have to have

583
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:29,520
more of a,
like unified worldview light,

584
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,990
like seriously have a compassion for
him.

585
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,810
I know this guy but,
but for everybody,

586
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:37,440
like,
like,

587
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,490
oh no,
fuck,

588
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,930
fuck,
Syria,

589
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:41,580
Libya,
Iraq,

590
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:42,600
you know,
they're bad.

591
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,160
No,
because if the world is kind of a small

592
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:50,370
place,
especially with technology these days,

593
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,880
you know,
and if,

594
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:58,090
if there are thousands and thousands of
refugees because of bombings,

595
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,740
you know,
people,

596
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,480
they seek revenge.
They,

597
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,371
they,
they,

598
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:06,230
they grow up and hate,
they,

599
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,940
they,
they grow up of course.

600
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:13,941
But what are you saying?
I'm saying that I'm saying that that

601
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,500
does affect us.
Like you originally said,

602
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,700
well we live in a nice place where it is
kind of basically.

603
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:25,500
Okay.
And I say that I don't know how long

604
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,800
that can exist without

605
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,050
all of the turmoil.
What I'm saying is if you're living in

606
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:34,900
the United States and you're living in a
fairly peaceful place,

607
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,160
you have to take into consideration that
there are people out there like Kim Jong

608
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,020
Aoun who do regularly killed their,
who regularly kills people who are

609
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,160
insubordinate,
who regularly kills anyone who thinks,

610
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,700
who would challenge him in any way,
and then he has nuclear powers and he is

611
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:55,570
going to do something and it's entirely
possible that he could launch a missile.

612
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,490
It's entire.
He's so fucking crazy.

613
00:29:57,491 --> 00:30:01,170
It's entirely possible that he could do
it in some sort of a suicide mission and

614
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,630
then he could launch a nuclear strike on
the United States in a suicide mission.

615
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,390
If he gets the capabilities.
Some people,

616
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,370
it really depends entirely on how that's
managed,

617
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:17,050
but there are people that would manage
that incorrectly and he could get to the

618
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,870
point where he has those nuclear
capabilities and he could launch and he

619
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:22,600
could do something that has to be taken
into consideration.

620
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,940
We've done it.
We did it to Hiroshima,

621
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:26,410
we did it to Nagasaki.
We lose.

622
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,860
We literally dropped indiscriminant
bombs on entire cities,

623
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,740
so that's unbelievable.
Crazy and it just happened.

624
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,350
Just happened on 100 years ago.
Not even right.

625
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,820
Isn't it interesting how,
how most people don't have a sense of

626
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,580
time and history.
Eighty fucking years is nothing.

627
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:44,650
It's nothing,
nothing that's nothing,

628
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,440
but the modern day person is like,
you know what,

629
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:51,100
a long time is 45 minutes ago on my
twitter feed.

630
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,380
Like that's 45 minutes ago that someone
gives you a,

631
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:56,770
an article,
they send you an article but growth from

632
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,950
2013 just like,
whoa,

633
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,310
that's four years ago is nothing.
I get caught up in that shit.

634
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,223
Like,
like,

635
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,160
you know what I love watching
documentaries is because it reminds me,

636
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:10,840
holy fuck.
Yes.

637
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:14,080
A lot of the same shit went down in
1960.

638
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,860
You know what I mean?

639
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,680
Sure.
Like demonstrations,

640
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,480
you know,
Nixon was in power.

641
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:22,060
We had Vietnam going on.
You know what I mean?

642
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,620
I think there's always been a problem
with people feeling like they're

643
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,970
represented and communication.
Those,

644
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:31,990
those two problems have always existed.
It just exists today in a different way

645
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,240
almost.
We almost have too much communication.

646
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,291
Well,
that's what I mean,

647
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,910
too much information.
A little bit.

648
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,780
Yeah,
for sure.

649
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,950
And I think you're definitely right that
we have to think of the whole world as

650
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:46,951
being a like one thing instead of
walling things off and.

651
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,660
But the problem is when you pull over,
right?

652
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:51,520
Yes.
But you get a little scared.

653
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,120
I mean sometimes fuck,
but you have someone who's a military

654
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,210
dictator like Kim John Loon.
That's a totally different situation.

655
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,210
Like he won't let the people live.
He shoots them when they try to leave

656
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,380
like this is.

657
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,040
This is a very,
very bad thing to be seeing in 2017.

658
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,280
That's entirely different than someone
who is a Syrian refugee who those people

659
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:14,830
are fleeing for their lives and
obviously they're in incredibly hostile

660
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:18,280
environments and situations,
but there are substantial parts of the

661
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:22,360
world that welcome those people and want
those people to have an opportunity to

662
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,640
get away from what they're experiencing.
You know,

663
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:27,610
there's a lot of people in this country
that argue for bringing them over here

664
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:31,420
and helping those people.
So I think our compassion is still

665
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:33,550
there,
but people don't want to be unsafe

666
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,480
themselves.
You know,

667
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:38,830
I think we,
I think we will eventually these

668
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,270
boundaries will become more and more
preposterous.

669
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:45,170
These lines in the ground that we've
drawn where we've decide like this is,

670
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,690
you know,
we are Canada and we are against you

671
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:52,310
America and you're connected to us by
the same dirt like we were tribes and

672
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:54,260
the tribes that were tribe earth.

673
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,270
Okay.
You know,

674
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,980
and I think once we realized that will
be a lot better off,

675
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:02,210
but then we're going to have to really
understand the allocation of resources.

676
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,000
Yes.
Yes.

677
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,540
Are you talking about also distribution
of wealth,

678
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:11,660
which is kind of another way to put
allocation of resources?

679
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Well,
I'm talking about fixing places where

680
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,640
there's no hope.
You know,

681
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:19,790
I mean it's,
you could say that it's allocation of

682
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,890
wealth.
Like one of the things you think about,

683
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:25,760
like when like Halliburton got these no
bid deals to go into Iraq and build

684
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:30,761
these things and why can't someone get
the same sort of contracts to go in and

685
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,170
established established places
like in the United States?

686
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:42,500
Like established community centers in
impoverished neighborhoods do the same

687
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:46,480
thing to Guadalajara,
go into Tiawana and try to like set it.

688
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,260
Here's the answer.
I think.

689
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:51,350
I mean this is my trip,
not trip,

690
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:54,550
but like my bent is like,
um,

691
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,090
there is just like what you're talking
about,

692
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:01,210
community building,
you know,

693
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,650
going into places,
setting up education centers,

694
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,820
it,
it doesn't seem to be a priority when it

695
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:08,810
was not profitable.

696
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,640
Yes.
Right.

697
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:15,641
But war war is a huge profitable.
Rebuilding is profitable.

698
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,970
That's what I'm saying.
Halliburton is rebuilding and rebuilding

699
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:21,380
his problem.
And what do you need to rebuild?

700
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:23,360
You need to fucking knock it down first.
Right?

701
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,520
And that,
that's weird,

702
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,200
right?
Because things are already knocked down,

703
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,740
but rebuilding them is now profitable.
What do you mean?

704
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,810
Oh,
parts of the world are already fucked.

705
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,690
But going in them and in rebuilding,
you know,

706
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:40,691
going to impoverished parts of Ecuador
and rebuilding that and try to,

707
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,460
you know,
make it so that these people have

708
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:47,680
opportunities to advance their lives and
take care of their families and there's

709
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,200
no money in that.
Why isn't their money of that?

710
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,100
I don't know.
What's weird that we know that

711
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,670
everything is about where there's money,
you know,

712
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,820
and that like,
look at how much the,

713
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,650
that's the problem.
Look at China,

714
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,380
right?

715
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,160
Look at how much their,
um,

716
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:04,790
their,
their,

717
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,880
their way of life has improved since
capitalism sort of been installed.

718
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:10,790
Like the amount of people that are in
poverty in China.

719
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,800
I was just reading this like the,
the staggering change since what's close

720
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:20,570
to capitalism capitalism,
but they have a lot more restrictions on

721
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:22,600
what they're allowed to do and not do.
You know,

722
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,650
in China they still can't research
tenement,

723
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:27,580
square research it.
What happened?

724
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,760
Yeah.
You can't find out about it.

725
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:29,900
Yeah,
that's crazy.

726
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,990
That's crazy.
And I feel like when you do that to

727
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:36,590
people,
if you say to people,

728
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,800
look,
you can't,

729
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:43,550
you can't look into that.
Isn't there immediately like,

730
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,310
I don't trust you.
Like you,

731
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,490
like it's immediate.
It's a dictatorship.

732
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,630
You know?
And that's,

733
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,550
that's what,
that's the crazy thing about Kim Jong

734
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,170
wound.
That's the crazy thing about China.

735
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,840
Anytime you're in a situation where you
have a dictatorship,

736
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,640
you have a group or a person who's
controlling the inflammation that gets

737
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:02,010
distributed to the people and then the
people who are under the thumb of this

738
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:04,350
person,
and then when this person says

739
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:05,850
something,
that thing is the law.

740
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,720
That is one of the scariest things about
trump is that what essentially trump is

741
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:14,721
doing is treating his word as law and
saying that everyone else is fake news

742
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:19,560
and they're all liars and everyone who
poses him,

743
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,230
they cannot have a reasonable opposition
of him.

744
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,260
Any,
any opposition must be chastised.

745
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,320
If he wasn't within our system,
he'd be a fucking Dick.

746
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:30,240
I mean,
he is that personality.

747
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

748
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,130
Well,
you know,

749
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,620
he's in this,
this thing with the FBI,

750
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,030
you know about this,
right?

751
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,050
Where they're investigating
the unnatural where it's at.

752
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:42,500
He's talking about fire read fucking
Miller.

753
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,700
Yeah.
As he's talking about,

754
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:49,701
I'm still not sure.
I think he knows and the people around

755
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:50,850
him know that,
dude,

756
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:54,750
you cannot do that because I think that
will.

757
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,700
I think you're going to fuck with the
wrong people.

758
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:58,470
They're like,
you still could fuck with the world.

759
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,380
People within this country already
fucked with the wrong people is fuck

760
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:04,560
with the intelligence community.
It means fuck with the CIA and the FBI

761
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:05,970
and they're all like,
Jesus Christ,

762
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:07,680
this guy.
But here's the thing.

763
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,420
At the FDA for him,
it's certainly not as dangerous.

764
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,860
It wasn't the sixties.
It's harder to kill a president today,

765
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,730
but the FBI,
it's just stopped a terrorist attack in

766
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:18,730
San Francisco.
This.

767
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,640
Yes,
you don't hear about it because the

768
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:23,630
president hasn't talked about it in the
news that talked about it a little more

769
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:26,790
to happen.
There was a planned isis terror attack

770
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:31,080
at one of the peers in San Francisco and
this guy who was a former soldier was

771
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:35,420
planning it and reached out to isis and
was trying to do in the US soldiers.

772
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,720
You're a soldier.
Look at that.

773
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:37,410
Yeah.
Well,

774
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,120
you know,
you get crazy on all sides,

775
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,570
but that's what I mean about,
you know,

776
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:45,540
when there is bad conditions all over
the world,

777
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,450
it filters and that's one way,
you know?

778
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,570
Yeah.
But this is a guy who was an American

779
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:54,750
citizen that wants to attack random
American civilians.

780
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,550
You know,
this is a crazy person who was the

781
00:37:56,551 --> 00:38:00,000
person who have blown a fuse and was
just going to do this for Isis and was

782
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,900
doing it publicly on facebook was it was
reaching out to these people.

783
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:06,120
So he was.
He had a blown fuse for sure.

784
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:09,600
He didn't understand what he was doing
or understand that obviously people are

785
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:11,940
going to be paying attention to these
fucking isis pages.

786
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,900
Isn't it wild that people publicly put
this shit out on facebook?

787
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,340
It's wild,
but it's not wild.

788
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,370
I mean,
there's a lot of doll mines out there.

789
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,340
But anyway,
the point is that the FBI thwarted this

790
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,890
attack.
President hasn't said a Goddamn word

791
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:29,610
about it.
He's praising these firefighters doing

792
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:32,760
an amazing job mazing job.
But he's not saying anything.

793
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,560
I wonder if,
because I wonder if it's because wants

794
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:36,130
everybody

795
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,450
to think,
hey look,

796
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:39,760
there's no.
There's no terrorists or activity going

797
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:42,940
on and just want to praise the FBI.
Well that's.

798
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,700
That's fucked up.
I think that's exactly what it is.

799
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,460
I think he's against getting groceries.
Getting investigated.

800
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,260
Yeah,
because he has a vendetta against the

801
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,060
FBI.
He's at war with the FBI.

802
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,770
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

803
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:59,010
This is a crazy situation where someone
have this mindset is running the country

804
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:01,810
and some people love it.
They love it mag.

805
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:03,730
Uh,
we're going to get things done.

806
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,600
Look at the job list.
Snus rate is down,

807
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,320
unemployment is down.
There's all this good stuff is

808
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:14,530
happening.
The stock market is hitting record high.

809
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,200
It's hilarious about when they talk
about the stock market.

810
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,680
I'm hitting record highs first of all.
I think it's a fact that 50 percent of

811
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:26,410
America is in poverty.
Five.

812
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:28,210
Oh,
you agree with that stat?

813
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,740
I don't know.
Is that real?

814
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,150
Yeah.
I mean you could look it up,

815
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:36,151
but it's poverty.
It's a certain level of income and I've

816
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,260
forgotten what it means.

817
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,620
What is the number?
Is it like I'm not $20,000 or.

818
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:46,650
Yeah,
it's around 30,000.

819
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,080
Yeah,
it's around there and I find out.

820
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,700
I think also it.
I think it also talks about benefits and

821
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:57,190
that was just an article man at the
Washington Post,

822
00:39:57,191 --> 00:40:00,850
dude.
About how people in their seventies are

823
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:05,530
having to take full time jobs because
their pensions have been taking away.

824
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:10,531
I'm in corporate America is taking away
shit.

825
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,930
Well Jamie was just talking about this
yesterday about how uh,

826
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:19,020
like companies are selling you the same
product but now it has like a half an

827
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:24,210
ounce less than it used to before and
the boxes are slightly smaller and I

828
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,100
just bought two boxes of cereal
yesterday and they both say they're 12

829
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:29,650
ounces,
one's 12 ounces and one's 12 point one

830
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:31,480
ounces,
but the boxes are not even close to the

831
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:34,330
same size,
same cereal to rights checks.

832
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,010
So it's the same shape.
Cereal and everything.

833
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,550
You told her that they're lying or do
you think that they've figured out a way

834
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:42,070
to get 12 ounces in a smaller box
because you know how you would open up

835
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:44,980
cereal and then there would be like a
little air space and then you'd get to

836
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:47,890
the package and then there's a little
air that package.

837
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,700
Cereal might be a bad example,
but gatorade for example was a 20.

838
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:55,390
It's 28 ounces now,
used to be a 32 ounces for three years

839
00:40:55,391 --> 00:41:00,391
ago.
A perfect example of like taking you pay

840
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,710
more and get less.
Well,

841
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,730
they just this.
It's just a fact.

842
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,540
Infinite growth.
That paradigm that corporations operate

843
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:13,450
under where you constantly have to
improve every quarter you have to make

844
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:15,370
more money.
You have an obligation to the same.

845
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,990
It's crazy.
It's like,

846
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,710
how come you can't make.
Listen if you make $100,000,000 in your

847
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,590
corporation this year,
why can't you make $100 million next

848
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,423
year?
And everybody's happy.

849
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,080
Like,
yeah.

850
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,940
I mean isn't that the isn't?
Yeah.

851
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,760
Isn't that the textbook definition of
greed?

852
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,550
See this three different size cups
appear to hold the same amount of soda,

853
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,360
might be a sponge and the bottom of one
of them you can't really tell,

854
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,560
but it just,
like I said,

855
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:42,500
this guy did this four or five times to
sort of prove that there wasn't.

856
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,140
This is a small medium and like super
large sized cup and they all hold the

857
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:50,280
same amount of liquid.
Huh?

858
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,170
Super Strange.
This was explained to you yesterday that

859
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:56,100
Bra,
Huh?

860
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,790
See this a daily mail's super sketchy,
but that's just where they sat in

861
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:01,630
England.
Yeah,

862
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:03,610
the Daily Mail.
Like they,

863
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,091
they,
they,

864
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:06,850
they're super sketchy with staff.
They're super sketchy.

865
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,530
Yeah,
I mean,

866
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,630
yeah,
there's definitely a problem with that.

867
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:16,631
We have with the system that's in place
in terms of like how corporations get

868
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:18,790
treated as individuals,
right?

869
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,670
They're allowed to donate enormous sums
of money now,

870
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,960
and this is a fairly recent within the
last decade,

871
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:31,830
the way that the structure has changed
and then there's also the diffusion of

872
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:36,190
responsibility inside the corporation.
If you work for a big evil corporation,

873
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,530
but you're a good guy,
you're ready pepitone,

874
00:42:38,531 --> 00:42:40,450
you're a good guy.
You waived your neighbor,

875
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:41,830
you know,
you give money to charity,

876
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,700
but meanwhile you're making toxic sludge
that's killing people in the Philippines

877
00:42:45,701 --> 00:42:46,910
or wherever the fuck it is.
You know,

878
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,990
you know how it goes.
Yeah,

879
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:50,980
it is how it goes,
and that's how it goes.

880
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,850
Also to justify this infinite growth
idea.

881
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,400
This corporation keeps growing and keeps
growing,

882
00:42:57,401 --> 00:43:01,150
keeps growing.
That's why trump is opening up these

883
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:04,330
national monuments for drilling wells.
That's really fucked.

884
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,370
I knew an outdoors guy.
Scary,

885
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,560
scary shit.
It's really scary shit.

886
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,900
But Natalie is scary.
It's,

887
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,793
it's,
it's,

888
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,640
it's,
it's an affront.

889
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,770
It's like,
no,

890
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,590
no,
I don't take away our fucking land

891
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,280
because to me I get talking about,
you know,

892
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,270
circling back to the panic,
I feel like,

893
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,180
wow,
these motherfuckers,

894
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,760
these core corporate greed,
let's call it.

895
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:30,460
Right?
And that's where patients and it's,

896
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:34,990
it's endless.
They're taking away our places where we

897
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:39,991
get some serenity.
Where were we fucking connect to nature,

898
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,800
you know,
like the,

899
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,790
the lifeblood of it.
You know what I mean?

900
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,150
They want to me and I,
to me,

901
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:51,550
they're taking,
they want everything fucked up about it.

902
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:52,120
It's,
it's,

903
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,160
it is Americans land,
right?

904
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,800
Is the public's land.
And so if they're going to go to these

905
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,790
areas and extract resources,
why should they have those resources?

906
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:03,460
Why?
Why are we allowing them to take the oil

907
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:05,620
out of these spots?
Why are we allowing them to take the

908
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:08,440
minerals out of these spots like these?
These are,

909
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:12,220
these are not there for your disposal.
This is American land,

910
00:44:12,221 --> 00:44:15,910
this is the public's land.
These corporations that want to come in

911
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:18,970
and start drilling and mining in these
areas,

912
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,090
it's sanctioned,
stealing and then,

913
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,570
and then to like jump to an issue one
step further.

914
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:30,990
What the fuck?
We're the only country who pulled out

915
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,010
of the climate accord right now.
Are you with me that it isn't climate

916
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:43,080
change is climate breakdown that's going
on and,

917
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,120
and,
and anybody you've had scientists on if

918
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:47,210
they talked,
have you had an environmentalist on

919
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,870
talking about this shit?
Um,

920
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:55,300
I mean just here in La this past summer.
You live in the valley too?

921
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,520
Yeah.
I never experienced like d,

922
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:05,590
it was 115 for 10 days and not 110 for
like three days in a row.

923
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:09,180
And then I was starting 2016 year one
day.

924
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,920
I remember telling my wife,
hey honey,

925
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:14,190
it's only one on one.
They were beating me down to like,

926
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:15,570
sweetie,
it's kind of Nice.

927
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:18,510
It's only 103 today.
You know what I mean?

928
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,920
But,
but my point is,

929
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,950
is that they're taking land to do more
oil drilling,

930
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,950
to do fucking fracking,
do that kind of stuff.

931
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:34,190
Where the fuck is that?
Why aren't we going completely toward

932
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,900
solar wind phase II?

933
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,010
That shit out,
especially in California,

934
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:44,310
if you fly over California,
you see very few clouds and all the

935
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:47,130
rooftops like these rooftops should all
be solar panels.

936
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:50,760
If they were,
we would have almost no need for

937
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,670
external power.
It's sunny 24 slash seven here and and

938
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:56,610
if it's not today,
within five years or 10 years,

939
00:45:56,611 --> 00:46:00,240
as the technology improves,
there would be a way to extract all of

940
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:02,770
our needs from solar power.
That's,

941
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,630
that's what I'm saying we should do
instead of fucking opening up laminate

942
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:10,620
problem is like there's so much money in
that oil and we still rely on it so

943
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:13,560
heavily right now and they're not.
They're not thinking about the future.

944
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:16,200
They're thinking about right now.
Right now we can get that the thing.

945
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,900
Here's the thing,
they're not thinking about the future

946
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,530
dude not be a future.
And I know that's really like,

947
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:26,580
like I don't want to be like,
you know,

948
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:31,780
but scientists really well known
scientists are saying,

949
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,260
you know,
these hurricanes are the beginning,

950
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:38,550
you know,
the massive ones we had that buried use.

951
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,200
Then you know that Barry,
there were a couple that really fucked

952
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:48,201
up and they're going to be the norm and
also the constant heat out here in la.

953
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,980
I mean,
you know what really freaked me out for

954
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:52,140
wildfires in December.
Yeah.

955
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:53,940
The big one that's still going on right
now.

956
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,400
They haven't even put it out in Ventura.
Yeah.

957
00:46:56,401 --> 00:46:58,500
Jamie was saying yesterday,
it's not totally contained,

958
00:46:58,501 --> 00:47:01,790
right?
It's still 90 percent.

959
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,940
It's like that fucking crazy.
It's been going on for weeks at Thomas

960
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,440
Fire.
Gigantic fire.

961
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,270
It's,
I mean it's an enormous fire.

962
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,980
Hundreds of thousands of acres and a
terrifying.

963
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,410
By the way,
the firefighters out here,

964
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,930
I cannot believe what they do animals,
but you know,

965
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:22,470
apparently they have a lot of prisoners
that they make fight the fires for like

966
00:47:22,471 --> 00:47:25,640
a dollar an hour.
Yeah.

967
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,790
It's like part of the Gig that's fucked
up.

968
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,010
Yeah.
You got to fake your own.

969
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,070
You've got to just run into

970
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,660
that fire,
get three.

971
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,430
But I think a lot of them,
like you have chicken shit,

972
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,440
it's fucked up,
but it's fucked up.

973
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,780
My car can get a fucking dollar an hour
for work.

974
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,900
Like why is it okay to like that slavery
is slavery.

975
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,510
Like if their work,
like I used to think that about license

976
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:51,310
plates,
like that was always the big thing.

977
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,490
Like in,
in Massachusetts that was always a joke

978
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:58,330
that like every two years a new comedian
would come up with the same show because

979
00:47:58,331 --> 00:48:01,480
it was so obvious is that a new
Hampshire,

980
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,960
the license plates say live free or die.
And I'm like,

981
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,180
uh,
those plates are made by prisoners.

982
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,040
And that was what was crazy.
It was like,

983
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:13,030
that was always the thing that was
always the thing about license plates.

984
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,290
They were made by prisoners,
right.

985
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,630
That was always the reference that we
would talk about how you're going to go

986
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:18,880
sent upstate and you gotta make license
plates.

987
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,680
It was,
that was what people did.

988
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,070
But when you make those license plates,
you're making like thirty cents a day or

989
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,380
whatever the fuck you're making.
Well again,

990
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,160
that gets back to corporate greed.
Like I was reading about that stuff like

991
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:32,140
verizon,
I don't know,

992
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:37,590
there's so many big corporations using
prison labor to make stuff for them and

993
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,030
prisoners also get charged.
They get charged,

994
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:45,040
I don't know where the fuck they come up
with the money,

995
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,370
but they get charged all these shit.
Like if you want to make calls,

996
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:51,820
if you have to buy your own fucking
uniforms,

997
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,470
it's like,
yeah,

998
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,150
well they're being punished.
I get,

999
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,720
I get the idea behind it,
but it isn't punishment.

1000
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,610
You have to be fucking confined space,
you know?

1001
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,430
I guess now you have to work.
Well the idea is that someone's

1002
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:08,650
profiting from it.
That's where it gets super squirrely.

1003
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,341
It's like,
wait a minute,

1004
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:11,080
okay,
I get the fact they're being punished,

1005
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,690
but who's making the money?
Is the money going to the victims of

1006
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:14,524
these crimes?
No.

1007
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,350
Okay.
So there's one thing if you made a guy

1008
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,180
like say if a guy robbed your house,
right?

1009
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:22,660
And then he goes to jail and then he
makes a thirty cents an hour.

1010
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,880
The,
the state should pay him.

1011
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,710
Like what a normal working wage would be
like 25 bucks an hour,

1012
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:31,990
whatever it is for this job this guy is
doing.

1013
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:36,160
And then you get all the rest.
Absolutely dickheads working for you

1014
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:38,830
while he's in the pokey and he's making
thirty cents an hour because he broke in

1015
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:39,300
your house.
No,

1016
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,020
no.
He's working for verizon.

1017
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:41,890
Yeah,
that's what's weird.

1018
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,430
He's working for some company that's
willing to pay for those services at an

1019
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:48,340
exorbitantly discounted rate.
Yeah.

1020
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,520
Now it's not.

1021
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,190
It's all not good man.
And here's the thing.

1022
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:54,790
You can't keep an eye on all of it.
He can't keep an eye on what's

1023
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,630
happening.
And then the private prison structure

1024
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:00,460
and then we know what happened with
Bernie Sanders.

1025
00:50:00,461 --> 00:50:04,270
His wife is involved in what the college
went under because of how is he legit?

1026
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,450
How many vacation homes is he happy.
And then you look at Hillary Clinton.

1027
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:07,961
Wait a minute.
Wait,

1028
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:08,441
hold on.
Hold on.

1029
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:09,580
What's this?
Clinton Foundation?

1030
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,040
How much money.
She didn't know what she was opposed to

1031
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:15,130
gay marriage until 2030 years.
You'll be overwhelmed.

1032
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:17,890
You'll be overwhelmed with all the
different people and all the different

1033
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:21,550
scandals and all the different
possibilities and you're in your car and

1034
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,610
you're on the one on one and you're
freaking the fuck out.

1035
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,580
Eddie pepitone.

1036
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,060
That's what it is,
why you have to go into nature,

1037
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,360
you know,
you have to go into nature,

1038
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,520
kind of disconnect a magnet.

1039
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:40,780
The native American Indians knew how to
do that.

1040
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,830
Yeah.
They knew how to do it,

1041
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,560
but that's all they had.
They didn't have cell phones.

1042
00:50:44,561 --> 00:50:46,720
It's not like they made a choice,
you know,

1043
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,230
it was interesting how you taking that
shit away from them by saying that,

1044
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,420
no,
I had sebastian younger,

1045
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,040
uh,
on the podcast.

1046
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,750
He's an author,
a brilliant guy,

1047
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:57,400
and one of the things that he was saying
was that,

1048
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,310
um,
during the revolutionary war,

1049
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:04,600
or I'm sorry,
during the time of colonization where

1050
00:51:04,601 --> 00:51:09,460
the Europeans are moving across America,
some of them were kidnapped by these

1051
00:51:09,461 --> 00:51:12,250
native American tribes.
And then when they were rescued by the

1052
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:13,480
soldiers,
they resisted.

1053
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:18,780
A lot of them wanted to stay the native
Americans and some of them moved in with

1054
00:51:19,361 --> 00:51:20,770
the tribes.
Like some people,

1055
00:51:20,771 --> 00:51:24,310
like voluntarily moved into tribe.
What does that tell you?

1056
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,383
Well,
this is what he said.

1057
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,110
No one did it the other way.
The native Americans did not join the

1058
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,400
Western civilization.
They,

1059
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:35,401
they didn't like the only force.
Did they join the cities and move into

1060
00:51:35,561 --> 00:51:40,561
these towns?
They wanted to be with native Americans.

1061
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,550
Well,
they wanted to live the natural way,

1062
00:51:42,551 --> 00:51:46,060
the way they've been living forever.
Their system is attuned to.

1063
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,740
Yeah.
Do you feel it?

1064
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:51,160
Because I originally started,
started this off with talking about

1065
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,520
anxiety and and as we've been talking,
I think the one of the biggest causes of

1066
00:51:58,121 --> 00:52:02,680
anxiety is disconnection.
Disconnection from mother earth

1067
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:06,850
disconnection,
disconnection from the heart of life,

1068
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,690
like disconnection.
I don't know man,

1069
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:11,410
but,
but,

1070
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,243
but,
but,

1071
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:16,870
but on,
on top of that than what's fueling that

1072
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,880
disconnection is this incredible
technology where you're bombarded with

1073
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
information about everything and you're
trying to make some fucking sense of it

1074
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:35,320
and your brain overloads and then.
And then the bigger picture almost is

1075
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:39,730
that there are people in power and there
are people in power.

1076
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:46,080
I don't know if it's a conspiracy,
but these people own everything they

1077
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:50,470
fucking own just about everything.

1078
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,650
Owning more where we're talking about a
bunch of different issues here.

1079
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:55,000
Then if you put in all these things
together,

1080
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,540
trying to put them together,
that what you're saying about people

1081
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:01,230
being disconnected and being overwhelmed
by that,

1082
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,660
all that stuff to think about that's
real because you're supposed to be

1083
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:07,890
thinking about your immediate area and
what the threats are and your immediate

1084
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,510
environment and where your friends are.
Where's the community?

1085
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,700
Where's their communities?
I mean they.

1086
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,430
They talk about this community is
breaking down like,

1087
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,810
like we have a comedy community.
Don't you think that's a big thing like

1088
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:21,700
our community,
like especially the comedy store.

1089
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,730
There's one of the cool things about the
comedy store is we all go there and we

1090
00:53:24,731 --> 00:53:27,480
see other and it's like very,
very friendly and supportive.

1091
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,130
I think it's huge.
Huge,

1092
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,990
so rare.

1093
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,180
I mean I,
I,

1094
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,580
I,
I realized that dad is what we're

1095
00:53:34,581 --> 00:53:37,140
talking about.
Like you need you,

1096
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:40,400
you ever have a fucking thing where
you're like flipping out about something

1097
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:45,140
and then you make one phone call or see
one friend and the problem goes away.

1098
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,040
Yeah.

1099
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,650
Especially if you,
maybe you and a friend are in some sort

1100
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:52,430
of a disagreement and you thought that
they thought this thing and they thought

1101
00:53:52,431 --> 00:53:55,100
that you thought that thing and you get
to talk and especially if you meet each

1102
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:56,990
other and your friends like,
no,

1103
00:53:56,991 --> 00:53:58,230
I thought this and you're like,
ah,

1104
00:53:58,231 --> 00:53:59,580
I thought you thought that.
And they're like,

1105
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,160
ah,
and then everybody's happy.

1106
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:05,450
So you were stressed out and freaked out
and nervous and feeling weird about

1107
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,910
talking to that person.
But then once you talk to them,

1108
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,820
everything's smoothed away.
Yeah,

1109
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:10,763
yeah.
That's,

1110
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,480
I don't know if people.
I think when you're doing that online

1111
00:54:14,481 --> 00:54:19,481
thing and you're spending your day
online or even texting,

1112
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:23,500
like I have to text friends and that's,
you know,

1113
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,580
but I see them.
Those are weird.

1114
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:29,190
I have a few of those,
a lot of east coast buddies still.

1115
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,150
I just texted them every couple of
months we text back and forth.

1116
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,730
Isn't to say it's like there's something
missing.

1117
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,260
No,
but if they call I won't answer the

1118
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,500
call.
I look at that time for a conversation

1119
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:41,940
right now.
Send me a text.

1120
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,221
I mean,
texts,

1121
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:45,590
I'll get back to you,
but I'm in the middle of doing my ads

1122
00:54:45,591 --> 00:54:48,890
here and I've got to fucking write this
bit and I wrote a fucking go somewhere

1123
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:50,160
and I got to work out an hour and.

1124
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,780
But um,
yeah,

1125
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,110
but I,
I think,

1126
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,721
you know,
and,

1127
00:54:57,721 --> 00:54:59,410
and we're all busy.
I get that too.

1128
00:54:59,411 --> 00:55:00,610
But it's like we,
we,

1129
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,670
we have to find time for the kids

1130
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,371
community.
I mean,

1131
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:08,160
I'm find time for being a human,
an actual human and are a huge part of

1132
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,020
being human is interacting with other
humans.

1133
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,540
We need each other.
The worst thing they can do to you in

1134
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:15,810
prison has put you in solitary.
I think of that.

1135
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,700
The worst thing they can do,
you're,

1136
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:22,620
you're locked up in a cement cage filled
with murderers and rapists and criminals

1137
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:25,470
in the worst they can,
they can do is to leave you alone.

1138
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,980
Yeah.
Isn't,

1139
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,040
that is the big punishment is not like
letting you go out and hang out with all

1140
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,860
the guys in the cafeteria.
No.

1141
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,060
Yeah.
Punishment is putting you in a room,

1142
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,560
taking away your clothes.

1143
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,790
So.
So just getting back to the technology,

1144
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:46,050
I think voyeurism is fucking killing
people.

1145
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:49,010
We've become like this nation of
lawyers,

1146
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:53,700
like just like what I was.
I went to a little birthday party

1147
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:57,990
yesterday and a bar and it's not to brag
and silver lake like bragging about

1148
00:55:57,991 --> 00:56:01,680
silver lake,
I don't like silver lake anyway.

1149
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,690
You don't.
I don't think I do.

1150
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,090
I'm also,
I'm also the guy who likes who makes

1151
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:11,670
immediate judgments places without
really knowing them.

1152
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,840
I think that's a comic thing to do for
sure.

1153
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:20,710
Absolute bullshit.
Oranges suck or

1154
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:27,410
fuck
what's wrong with overlay?

1155
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,850
No,
but I do.

1156
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:30,760
I just want to talk about voyeurism and
technology.

1157
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,340
So.
So I was trying to do the thing.

1158
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:38,341
We were talking about fucking hanging
with people around us in this bar.

1159
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:43,540
We're five fucking television screens
and,

1160
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:46,810
and I'm the type of guy and again,
it's my anxiety,

1161
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,670
like my tension in me.

1162
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,400
I wanted to go and go,
can you please.

1163
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:54,430
And this is how I would say it too,
which is why I never get anything done.

1164
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:58,780
I go,
would you please turn off the fucking

1165
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,190
televisions?
By the way?

1166
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:04,080
They didn't even have a fight on,
they didn't even have a good game on it

1167
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:09,330
because the games were over something
and it was just showing random dumb

1168
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,170
shit.
Like,

1169
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,480
I don't know,
one was a reality show where people

1170
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:15,250
doing weird things,
you know what I mean?

1171
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:20,490
And it's so loud and my vision was drawn
to this shit constantly and it was like,

1172
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,920
no man,
this is the problem.

1173
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:28,780
This is.
It was right there instead.

1174
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,110
But if you own a bar and you want people
to come in and spend a lot of money,

1175
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:33,550
you gotta give them something to stare
at

1176
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,770
the problem.
You can have acute community bar,

1177
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:40,910
like when them little pubs in England,
you know,

1178
00:57:40,911 --> 00:57:41,930
it's been around for a thousand.

1179
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,870
They don't have the TV's right.
I doubt it.

1180
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,730
I don't know.
I've never been to one,

1181
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,800
but I would assume if they're a thousand
years old,

1182
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,560
they don't fucking stick giant flat
screens everywhere.

1183
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,480
Right.
But what about if we give it a shot

1184
00:57:52,481 --> 00:57:56,380
where if I owned a bar in silver lake
fucking someone said it would be funny

1185
00:57:56,381 --> 00:58:01,381
if I just had one black and white and
I'm just showing old Joe Louis fights on

1186
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:03,130
it.
Like really small.

1187
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,973
Absolutely.
Cool.

1188
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,980
Joe Louis versus.
Who is the guy that he had these great

1189
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:10,080
fights with?
Was it Max?

1190
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,330
Max Schmeling,
yeah.

1191
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:11,991
Yeah.
Maximum.

1192
00:58:11,991 --> 00:58:16,510
Ellen was unfairly thought of as a Nazi.
He was really just a German.

1193
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,630
You just a German guy who was a boxer
who really didn't want to represent

1194
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:21,880
Hitler apparently,
from what I've read.

1195
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,940
Yeah.
It was a big rival of Louis where they

1196
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:27,670
had these incredible.
He stopped Lewis and the first fight and

1197
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,680
then Louis destroyed him in the second
fight.

1198
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:33,910
And the big thing about him beating
Louis was that he beat Louis and Louis

1199
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:36,040
was that he stopped Louis.
Hmm.

1200
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,750
Uh,
I think he.

1201
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,790
Did he think he did an in Louis?
Hardly ever.

1202
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,960
I mean,
did he lose one?

1203
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:43,810
Two fights was at he lose.
He lost quite a few when he got older

1204
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:47,860
and his career lost to rocky Marciano by
brutal knockout and um,

1205
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,360
but that was,
he was quite a bit older.

1206
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:50,740
I think he was in his forties at the
time,

1207
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:54,070
but I think um,
when he had the rematch,

1208
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,000
I think he,
I think Max schmeling might have killed

1209
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,490
him.
And then when he had the rematch he

1210
00:58:57,491 --> 00:59:00,970
destroyed Max schmeling.
Here it is a loss by K.

1211
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,040
Oh yeah.
Does it say what round 12 out of 36.

1212
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:10,450
Yeah.
And then he came back.

1213
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:14,380
There was another guy,
he came back and he was a giant hero

1214
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:16,270
when he knocked out smelling in the
first round.

1215
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,960
Scroll up all the way.
How many years later was that?

1216
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,980
Eight 38?

1217
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,870
Yeah.
So you remembered first round?

1218
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,621
Yeah.
Oh,

1219
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:25,810
he smashed him.
Yeah.

1220
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,700
I mean that was when Joe Lewis was Joe
Lewis.

1221
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:30,530
I mean that was when he had really come
into his own.

1222
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:32,360
And then he went on this incredible
tear.

1223
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,300
They used to call it the bottom of the
month club because he was just locked,

1224
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:37,220
knocking out anybody who's willing to
get in there with him.

1225
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,610
Yeah,
he,

1226
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:42,830
he thought some legit guys and billy
conn found them a couple of times who

1227
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:47,360
was actually a light heavyweight buddy
bear.

1228
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:50,760
Was that Max Baer's?
It says disqualified.

1229
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,600
You see that 49 and one.
I don't know what happened there.

1230
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,380
I wonder if that's a relation to Max
Baer.

1231
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,650
Probably the 19 thirties.
Must have been.

1232
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:02,600
He imagined going back to the thirties
and forties.

1233
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:04,940
So look at this.
He was the champ all the way up to

1234
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:07,940
Ezzard Charles in 1950.
Think of that.

1235
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:11,870
And he started in [inaudible] 36.
So the fight with the first fight with

1236
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:15,890
Max Baer was 36 with Max schmeling
rather was a 30.

1237
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,930
Hold on right there.
He.

1238
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:19,820
Yeah.
So he rematched them in 38.

1239
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:25,040
The first fight was in 36 and then he
was all the way the fuck scroll all the

1240
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:28,670
way up to the top.
By the time he lost he lost the Jersey.

1241
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:32,240
Joe Walcott a unanimous decision in
1950.

1242
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,330
That's incredible.
That's 14 years later.

1243
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,670
Wow.
Fucking crazy.

1244
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:39,090
No,
his first loss was to Ezra.

1245
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,130
Charles,
sorry.

1246
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,390
Yeah,
he Kao Jersey.

1247
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:42,530
Joe Walcott,
by the way,

1248
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:47,350
that you know,
Yankee stadium was the venue for less

1249
01:00:47,351 --> 01:00:51,680
Chicago Stadium and these were huge
events.

1250
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:55,880
He won a bunch of fights after that.
He lost the unanimous decision,

1251
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:59,480
scroll all the way up and then lost
again to rocky Marciano.

1252
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:04,370
So you really only lost three times.
It looks like a believable three big

1253
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:06,200
ones in the later stages of his career.

1254
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,240
Unless he lost earlier.
What's his overall record?

1255
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,020
It was 66 and three according to that.
So three losses.

1256
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:15,440
So one max mayor,
the brutal one to rocky Marciano,

1257
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:17,930
which ended his career.
Did you see that Charles?

1258
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,090
The brutal one?
Yeah.

1259
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:20,550
You want to watch it?
I,

1260
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,460
I,
I love,

1261
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,120
I love.
I grew up watching boxing.

1262
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,770
Did Ya?
Yeah.

1263
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:31,550
And it wasn't paperview it was ABC 59.
Yeah,

1264
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:34,640
it was like,
it was like network back then.

1265
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:39,290
There was something,
it wasn't paper view and they were free

1266
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:43,190
tv and I really got into the sport like
I was like,

1267
01:01:43,191 --> 01:01:46,010
I would be like so psyched to see this
shit.

1268
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,340
I'd be like,
I would watch you remember a guy named

1269
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,480
Oscar Bona.
Bona point of view.

1270
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:56,060
He was like a bro.
He was just like this kind of wild

1271
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:59,810
brawler,
but it was a big guy and he'd fight guys

1272
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:00,590
like,
uh,

1273
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:03,230
I don't know if he changed his name yet.
Cassius clay.

1274
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:04,064
Oh,
what's this?

1275
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,200
This is jersey.
This is a,

1276
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,170
as a Charles,
right?

1277
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:10,610
Is that as a charles the loss,
but that's not the one we want to see.

1278
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:14,720
Want to see the rocky Marciano one.
This was the one where as a Charles the

1279
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:17,060
first guy to beat him and he beat him by
unanimous decision,

1280
01:02:17,061 --> 01:02:17,900
but we look,
first of all,

1281
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,860
look how much smaller were back then,

1282
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,060
like rocky Marciano when he won,
the heavyweight title was 15 pounds

1283
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:26,250
lighter than me.
Is that right?

1284
01:02:26,251 --> 01:02:27,360
Yeah.
Think of that.

1285
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:31,140
And I think he was only five,
10 and that might've been bullshit.

1286
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,210
You know,
like people were a little sketchy about

1287
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:35,680
how tall they were back then.
You know,

1288
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:39,000
try to find that rocky Marciano one
this.

1289
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:40,170
Um,
yeah.

1290
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:41,910
I mean he,
I believe at the time,

1291
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:45,000
I think when he was the champ,
he was 185 pounds,

1292
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,840
maybe one 90 and Seattle was known like,
like Marcy Ghana was known for like just

1293
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,760
having unbelievable strength and his
punches.

1294
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:59,960
Like she fucking is this.
Yeah,

1295
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,410
that's what he was.
He was like,

1296
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,000
this is this hitting.
Yeah.

1297
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:05,580
This would think of an immigrant brock
town brawl.

1298
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:09,490
Like he was from Massachusetts,
Brockton mass.

1299
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,460
He looked small.
Yeah.

1300
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,130
Yeah.
He's 15 pounds lighter than me.

1301
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:16,770
Man.
Louis Louis isn't even that big.

1302
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:20,100
Louis is probably 200 pounds back then.
That was a heavyweight back then.

1303
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,250
It's just a different world.
People didn't have that kind of food.

1304
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,310
They didn't have enough to eat.
They didn't have the nutrition

1305
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:28,020
knowledge.
They didn't have steroids.

1306
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:30,570
They didn't have weight lifting.
I mean they had weightlifting,

1307
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:33,330
but boxers really didn't engage in that
is very rare.

1308
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:36,240
They thought it stiffened you up.
They didn't understand that the

1309
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:39,000
stiffening you up is just as your,
you know,

1310
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:42,120
getting sore and that you have to
recover from that and that's how you get

1311
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:44,130
bigger and stronger.
Like boxers today,

1312
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:47,250
if you look at like Anthony Joshua,
who's the heavyweight champion,

1313
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:49,110
the world now as you look at him.
Yeah,

1314
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:52,650
he's an English fellow.
He's a tank.

1315
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,930
I mean he's a busy man.
You look at Anthony,

1316
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:57,600
Joshua,
he looks like like a superhero.

1317
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:00,060
Do they,
do those guys have as much stamina as

1318
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:00,894
these guys do?

1319
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,670
They do,
yeah,

1320
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:06,120
because this conditioning methods that
they have today are just so superior.

1321
01:04:06,121 --> 01:04:10,580
They understand rest and recovery and
they monitor your heart rate and you

1322
01:04:10,581 --> 01:04:13,620
know they're,
they're monitoring lactic acid build up

1323
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:17,160
and creatine in your blood and so the
science is really,

1324
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:20,680
it's such a scientific.
If they engage in that at,

1325
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,400
you know,
some,

1326
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,050
some people still take it old school,
but I just think they know more about

1327
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:30,051
what gets you in condition and high
intensity conditioning drills.

1328
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:34,620
High Rocky Marciano had something that
you can't teach people,

1329
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,800
which is just brutal,
brutal power.

1330
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:42,950
He just had the ability to land these
bone crushing shots and he also was

1331
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:46,680
insanely tough.
You're dealing with a just a different

1332
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:48,720
time.
Like I was having this conversation with

1333
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:51,780
my wife this morning.
We were talking about old school.

1334
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:54,930
Keep that going on and see the end.
It's brutal.

1335
01:04:55,340 --> 01:05:00,340
We were talking about old school
cartoons and about Pinocchio and they

1336
01:05:01,461 --> 01:05:04,440
were so mean.
There were so mean and even old school

1337
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:07,290
cartoons about Santa and Christmas
elves.

1338
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:09,530
The ells are all shitty to each other.
Like,

1339
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:14,190
what the fuck I fuck you guys work for
pc thou they totally pct out.

1340
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:17,680
But back then in the 19 forties and
fifties and these cartoons were

1341
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:20,960
originally made,
the world was a hard place mat.

1342
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:26,110
It was hard from World War Two was World
War II just over or.

1343
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:28,570
Yeah,
well here's something that I didn't

1344
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:31,180
realize until recently.
My friend Steve Rinella was actually

1345
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:35,290
talking about this on a podcast when we
talk about factory farming and large

1346
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:37,570
scale agriculture when it comes to
stuff.

1347
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:39,460
By the way,
when we talk about that,

1348
01:05:39,461 --> 01:05:43,720
the reason why that all got instituted,
the reason why we have those programs

1349
01:05:43,721 --> 01:05:47,620
set in place in America was because of
famine because people were worried about

1350
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:50,050
what happened to the Europeans during
World War Two,

1351
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:54,580
during World War One and World War Two.
It's estimated that millions of people

1352
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:57,880
starve to death in the world and in the
United States.

1353
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:01,930
After the war.
They wanted to do something to make sure

1354
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:04,930
that that didn't happen over here and
one of the things they did was they

1355
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:07,790
started instituting subsidies for
farmers to make sure,

1356
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:08,920
look,
you're not making enough money,

1357
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:12,700
but we're going to give you money just
so that we have all this food on reserve

1358
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,590
so that everyone thinks about it as,
oh,

1359
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:18,310
this is evil thing that the government
has done to keep us fat and stupid,

1360
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:21,670
and no,
it was originally put in place to

1361
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:25,840
prepare for the worst case scenario,
but we're at war again and we're short

1362
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:26,380
on food.

1363
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,770
I get it.
I get the genesis of it,

1364
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,930
but,
but now,

1365
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,180
now it sucks.
It's horrible.

1366
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,330
Fucking horrible.
The worst part is the animals.

1367
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,061
See,
that's,

1368
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:41,860
that's my thing.
I watch a fucking.

1369
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:42,650
I mean,
um,

1370
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,820
I,
I have gone to veganism and I grew up

1371
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:47,590
Italian and we ate everything.
I mean,

1372
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:50,900
I love sauce and I mean,
I just couldn't admit it.

1373
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:56,050
It's amazing that I have gone this way
and I did it because my wife got me into

1374
01:06:58,751 --> 01:07:02,590
it,
a big animal rights activists and just

1375
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:07,540
watching some fucking slaughterhouse
videos and seeing the fear.

1376
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:12,640
I mean to me animals and the most
powerless because they don't have any

1377
01:07:12,641 --> 01:07:14,230
choice in this shit,
you know,

1378
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:19,231
human beings who have fucking horrible
life since at least some fucking element

1379
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,050
of choice and freewill fucking animals
are just,

1380
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,530
it's just like,
especially factory farmed animals.

1381
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:27,590
Right?
Dude,

1382
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,350
I mean they're just trapped.
So

1383
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,260
yeah,
I have been for,

1384
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:36,790
I have been for,
I would say it took a while to like,

1385
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:40,660
not like slip I would say pretty solidly
for three years,

1386
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:41,570
four years.
Um,

1387
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,840
and how's,
do you get your health monitor?

1388
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:48,790
Do you get your blood levels checked?
My sugars are a little high because what

1389
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:52,480
happens for me and,
and this could just be fucking

1390
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:53,470
willpower.
I,

1391
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:55,210
I don't know,
but.

1392
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,680
Oh,
he just knocked down.

1393
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,530
Oh,
left hook dropped.

1394
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,810
And this is,
you know,

1395
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,010
an older Joe.
Louis.

1396
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:05,640
How old was Joe Lewis at the time of
this young Jamie to say,

1397
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:09,280
and rock and Marsianno.
How old was Marsianno?

1398
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,340
He was in his prime,
I think Marciano was 30 or something

1399
01:08:12,341 --> 01:08:14,420
like he is a lot smaller than um.

1400
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:17,930
Does it say no?
No.

1401
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:19,933
He was older.

1402
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,101
Yeah.
Nineteen.

1403
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:24,470
Fifty one.
He got knocked out by Marsianno.

1404
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:26,360
That's crazy.
God,

1405
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:28,580
I love Bradick.
I loved that Cinderella Story.

1406
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:32,200
You that Russell Crowe is fucking great,
you know.

1407
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,970
But anyway,
so you eat too much carbs.

1408
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:40,550
Yes I do.
I do carbs and terrible for you,

1409
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:42,020
man.
That'll do 10 more than anything.

1410
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,560
What about eggs?
Fuck Dude.

1411
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:46,551
Vegan?
Yeah.

1412
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:48,680
But why go vegan when eggs don't harm
anything.

1413
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:52,010
If you get like,
I have chickens if free range chicken.

1414
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:52,821
Yeah man,
they,

1415
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:54,500
they,
they just run around.

1416
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:56,030
You feed them,
have a good old time,

1417
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,220
and then you eat their eggs like no one
gets hurt.

1418
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,580
The eggs are not viable because there's
no rooster.

1419
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,140
Right?
So you're not taking away a life.

1420
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:06,170
This is just something that the,
the chicken's almost like,

1421
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,460
you
know,

1422
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,270
they're just ags now.
They're only an embryo if it's on,

1423
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,940
if it's pregnant.
So it has to get fucked by a rooster.

1424
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,860
If there's no rooster,
they just lay eggs.

1425
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:17,853
Oh

1426
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,720
No.
Funny that most people didn't know that.

1427
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,300
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that until I got chickens.

1428
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,700
I,
I kind of intellectualized it,

1429
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,870
but then I was,
oh yeah,

1430
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:26,980
yeah.
There's no rooster.

1431
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,180
How could they?
Of course,

1432
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:31,990
it's not like the chickens can lay eggs
and those eggs can become new chickens.

1433
01:09:31,991 --> 01:09:34,510
No,
that only happens if a rooster gets in

1434
01:09:34,511 --> 01:09:37,900
the hen house.
So I guess I guess the answer to that,

1435
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:42,700
I guess the answer to that would be the
way they housed the fucking chickens to

1436
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:44,290
make.
We don't have to get them that way.

1437
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:45,850
You can get free range.
I mean,

1438
01:09:45,851 --> 01:09:47,590
there's,
there's places that you can get

1439
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:51,070
legitimate gentlemen free.
You might actually even visit the farms,

1440
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,930
you know,
there's a guy that we had on the

1441
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:55,600
podcast.
What does that gentleman's name that

1442
01:09:55,601 --> 01:09:58,340
runs polyface farms?
Joel Salatin,

1443
01:09:58,620 --> 01:09:59,341
Joel Saltz.
Oh,

1444
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:00,370
I've heard of that name.

1445
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:02,370
He's a real.
You main?

1446
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,390
Yes.
And He,

1447
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,920
you've heard of him.
I think it was in a movie called forks

1448
01:10:05,921 --> 01:10:07,060
over knives.
Maybe.

1449
01:10:07,061 --> 01:10:09,920
I Dunno.
Maybe that movie is very deceptive that

1450
01:10:09,921 --> 01:10:12,100
that movie is filled with a lot of
bullshit that works overnight.

1451
01:10:12,101 --> 01:10:12,761
Yes,
yes,

1452
01:10:12,761 --> 01:10:13,510
yes.
That's it.

1453
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:16,030
Vegan propaganda movie.
And they're the same guys that did the

1454
01:10:16,031 --> 01:10:17,680
most recent one,
which is,

1455
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:21,250
uh,
what the health widely torn apart by

1456
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:23,500
actual scientists to understand human
nutrition.

1457
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,060
Oh yeah,
yes.

1458
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:27,490
Yeah.
Real problems like meat does not cause

1459
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:30,730
diabetes.
There's zero evidence that does when

1460
01:10:30,731 --> 01:10:33,910
diabetes is caused by sugar and by
complex carbohydrates,

1461
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:36,340
or excuse me,
by refined carbohydrates,

1462
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:38,860
this not processed all diabetes,
right.

1463
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:43,840
Obviously there's genetic diet.
What about the connection between meat

1464
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:46,930
and heart disease use?
Here's a connection.

1465
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,100
When you say people who eat meat are
more likely to have heart attacks,

1466
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:51,520
right?

1467
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,140
You're not saying what they eat the meat
with.

1468
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,960
Are they eating a piece of grass fed
steak or the eating of Shitty

1469
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:58,390
cheeseburger that's on a bond that's
filled with sugar,

1470
01:10:58,391 --> 01:11:01,270
with fries and that they have a syrupy
soda with it.

1471
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:06,190
Just talk about this.
I've had Dr Rhonda Patrick was on this

1472
01:11:06,191 --> 01:11:09,220
recently and what she said,
the zero is a direct correlation between

1473
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:13,350
consumption of saturated fats along with
refined sugar.

1474
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:16,440
When you have refined sugar and
saturated fats,

1475
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:20,790
it produces a lot of bad cholesterol and
this is one of the things that's been

1476
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:25,791
proven clinically to lead to heart
attacks clinically to lead to strokes

1477
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:31,320
and hardening of the arteries and yeah,
it's the big thing is sugar.

1478
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:33,780
The big thing is sugar and
carbohydrates.

1479
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:35,970
Those are the big things.
And carbs turn into sugar.

1480
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,420
Yes,
but

1481
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,550
I,
I very little carbs.

1482
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,840
Very little.
Very little.

1483
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,110
They'll crave them,
huh?

1484
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,750
No.
Once you get out of it,

1485
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,430
see,
a lot of is your gut health.

1486
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,920
A lot of it is what's going on inside
your stomach.

1487
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,440
Like what?
What your stomach is used to eating.

1488
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:55,410
If you feed your stomach sugar and
processed,

1489
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:59,880
refined carbohydrates all the time,
that's what you've got in your gut.

1490
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,920
I mean,
that's the kind of gut flora your.

1491
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,560
You're cultivating and it's gonna.
That's what leaks.

1492
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,110
Delete leads to leaky gut,
leads to inflammation,

1493
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,560
you know?
I mean,

1494
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,230
I want to pick on you,
but you're a little overweight.

1495
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:10,741
No,
no,

1496
01:12:10,741 --> 01:12:11,130
no,
no.

1497
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:14,430
And this is a lot of innovative problem
with carbs.

1498
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,950
Yeah.
And my trip has been.

1499
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,530
My trip has been that,
um,

1500
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:22,560
about the animal rights.
You know what I mean?

1501
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,180
Like,
like I don't,

1502
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,840
I fucking hate the way they are.
That's fine,

1503
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,190
but end,
it's good.

1504
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,530
But you can do better for yourself.
I mean,

1505
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:34,140
you can live,
you can live an ethical,

1506
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:39,141
humane life with no animal products
other than like free range eggs and be

1507
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:43,260
okay and just cut all the dairy out,
cut all the things that you are.

1508
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:45,510
But I'm just what I'm saying to anybody
even listening to this.

1509
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,900
You can,
you can have eggs and you can get plenty

1510
01:12:48,901 --> 01:12:50,320
of it from A.
There's a,

1511
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:54,960
there's a lot of plant based protein
that's like very rich and powerful for

1512
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:57,210
you and excellent for you.
Hemp based protein is really good.

1513
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:02,070
Spirulina is fantastic for you.
There's a lot of really good sources of

1514
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:03,750
nutrients,
but you got to really pay attention to

1515
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:06,570
what you're putting in your body.
If you just eat vegan pizza and vegan

1516
01:13:06,571 --> 01:13:07,680
cookies all the time,
you're going to get.

1517
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,530
Well,
I know it's going to fight it out.

1518
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,530
Right?
You're right.

1519
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:15,810
And I do find myself craving like,
and maybe that's because I put it in,

1520
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,240
you know the fucking.
Oh yeah,

1521
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:20,610
it's gonna be before I came here I had a
fucking,

1522
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,040
you know,
blueberry Bagel.

1523
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,440
Whoa,
that's great.

1524
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,393
Right.

1525
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:32,120
You feel good when they're going in.
They really do.

1526
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:34,560
You what?
I don't think that's what gave you the

1527
01:13:34,561 --> 01:13:35,840
panic attack.
No,

1528
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:36,960
no,
not specifically,

1529
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:38,130
but I.
But I think,

1530
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:40,200
you know,
if you're feeling kind of shitty and

1531
01:13:40,201 --> 01:13:42,180
general,
you're more susceptible to think you're

1532
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:43,014
right.
For sure.

1533
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:45,570
Yeah.
If you could just cut out carbs.

1534
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,300
It's harder on a Vegan diet,
but it's positive.

1535
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:50,640
Right?
But you got to get a good book on it.

1536
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:54,570
You got to find out like there's,
there's really good vegan health books

1537
01:13:54,571 --> 01:13:58,410
that can show you how to eat in the
right way to go that way at all.

1538
01:13:58,411 --> 01:14:00,540
Or you reject it.
Well,

1539
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:03,600
it's not that I reject it for me.
Um,

1540
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:06,570
I,
I eat wild game almost exclusively.

1541
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:08,630
The wild animals that I hunt.
Yeah.

1542
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,680
So I hunt the wild animals and if I an
elk,

1543
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:14,080
I get hundreds of pounds of meat and I
eat that all year.

1544
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,140
I have commercial freezers in the back.
I'll show you after the show.

1545
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:19,510
I keep meat here.
I have meat at home.

1546
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,290
I give me to my friends.
And so my meat that I get is a wild

1547
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,970
animal that was going to get eaten by a
wolf.

1548
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,500
Like if I,
if I didn't get it,

1549
01:14:26,501 --> 01:14:30,830
I mean this isn't a factory farmed
prisoner that gets to slaughter.

1550
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:35,170
Um,
this year I got an elk in Utah,

1551
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,220
a shot in Utah,
and I also shot one in California in a

1552
01:14:39,221 --> 01:14:43,780
place called to hone ranch is this
270,000 acre ranch in the middle of the

1553
01:14:43,781 --> 01:14:45,550
country or middle of the state rather.
Right.

1554
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,030
But I'm getting it that way.
To me it feels.

1555
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:50,560
When I,
before I started hunting,

1556
01:14:50,561 --> 01:14:53,350
I had decided I was either going to be a
Vegan or I was going to be a hunter.

1557
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,243
I'm like,
I'm going to figure it out.

1558
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,690
What I'm going to do.
I didn't want to eat.

1559
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:59,800
You don't want to take part in that.
When you,

1560
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:01,440
when you killed the elk,
right?

1561
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,820
When you shoot it,
do you have like,

1562
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,730
like what's the feeling there?
That must be intense.

1563
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:08,380
It's very intense.
There's a moment,

1564
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,780
there's definitely a moment of loss.
Will you feel like,

1565
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,520
you know,
this animal is,

1566
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:13,870
is gone now,
you know,

1567
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:15,910
and,
but there's also a moment of reverence

1568
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,090
and awe,
but you got to do it sustainably.

1569
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,060
Like when I do it,
I'm doing it in places that have

1570
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:25,480
extremely healthy populations.
You get an animal that's past its

1571
01:15:25,481 --> 01:15:27,010
breeding prime,
right?

1572
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:29,500
You get an animal that's seven,
eight,

1573
01:15:29,501 --> 01:15:32,290
nine years old where they really don't
have much time left you.

1574
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,810
That's what you target.
Like people think when you target a

1575
01:15:34,811 --> 01:15:37,380
trophy animal,
you again barry,

1576
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:42,490
you're very specific about you know,
what you're doing very specific and I'm

1577
01:15:43,241 --> 01:15:47,020
also specific about making a difficult,
which is why I do it with a bow and

1578
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:47,730
arrow.

1579
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:49,000
I don't,
you know,

1580
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:51,610
I mean I've hunted animals with rifles
and I don't think there's anything wrong

1581
01:15:51,611 --> 01:15:55,690
with it,
but for me I feel like if I really want

1582
01:15:55,691 --> 01:16:00,370
to make this a more even arrangement and
make it more difficult and make it more

1583
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:01,870
ethical,
I use a bow and arrow.

1584
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,090
Yeah.
But there is that high.

1585
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:05,400
Like you know,
you,

1586
01:16:05,401 --> 01:16:09,220
you've killed it and then you feel a
sense of loss.

1587
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:11,200
There is a sense of loss.
It's c,

1588
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:15,100
that's what we've run across a bunch of.
This is one of the things that once you

1589
01:16:15,101 --> 01:16:17,950
get into the natural world and really
started understanding what's going on

1590
01:16:17,951 --> 01:16:20,200
out there,
you realize like this is this.

1591
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:22,990
No one gets out of this ride alive with
this.

1592
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,490
This like the ALC that I killed hae had
holes all over his body,

1593
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:30,130
all over his body when we were taking
them apart.

1594
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:32,230
Holes everywhere from other elk stabbing
him.

1595
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,560
Oh,
that's what you look up there.

1596
01:16:35,561 --> 01:16:36,660
All that shit,
those,

1597
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:38,110
those elk antlers,
those real,

1598
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,390
that's real.
That's the one that I shot in September,

1599
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,900
that those things are designed to kill
other elk.

1600
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:48,370
They slash each other.
They clash and smash those horns

1601
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:50,170
together and it's all to fight over
breeding.

1602
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:54,820
And the most powerful ones with the
biggest antlers are the ones that get to

1603
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:57,730
breed.
And one of the best ways to ensure the

1604
01:16:57,731 --> 01:17:00,040
health of this,
this,

1605
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:03,160
uh,
this group of animals is once this

1606
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:06,670
animal has reached its breeding prime,
that's the one you take out.

1607
01:17:06,671 --> 01:17:10,160
You take out the herd bull.
It allows the younger bowls to have an

1608
01:17:10,161 --> 01:17:13,730
opportunity to breed.
You can spray genetic wisdom to see the

1609
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:14,600
big dog.
Yeah.

1610
01:17:14,601 --> 01:17:15,890
You see the herd,
they call him the herd.

1611
01:17:15,891 --> 01:17:18,020
Bull had you learned that?

1612
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:22,490
I got obsessed about five and a half
years ago and got crazy with it.

1613
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,760
Food and.
Yeah.

1614
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:28,050
Yeah,
well I got obsessed before actually one

1615
01:17:28,051 --> 01:17:31,070
hunting,
but I went hunting in 2012 was the first

1616
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:35,150
time I went and then once I did,
once I did that and I was like,

1617
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,650
okay,
this is what I'm doing now.

1618
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:38,390
Like this makes sense.
This is.

1619
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,700
And it's difficult.
So it's a pursuit.

1620
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:43,670
So my food now isn't just food that I
got.

1621
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:45,080
Now.
There's this like this intense

1622
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:49,820
connection with that food.
Nobody's got a fucking connection with

1623
01:17:49,821 --> 01:17:50,930
their food.
People don't.

1624
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,190
But the weird thing is everyone did
until about 100 years ago.

1625
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,890
That's what really crazy.
This is so new.

1626
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,050
So new.
Yeah.

1627
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,370
You got a 19,
17.

1628
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,670
Everybody had probably seen an animal
get killed on a farm on farms.

1629
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,650
I mean everybody was.
You were around it.

1630
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:09,290
It was a normal thing.
You go with 18 slash 17,

1631
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,910
you couldn't avoid it.
You go to a marketplace,

1632
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:13,580
you'd go to a farmer,
you go to.

1633
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:17,150
I mean everybody and then also there was
no pesticides.

1634
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,550
The genetic manipulation of the food was
nonexistent.

1635
01:18:19,551 --> 01:18:22,250
It was,
it was everything was as it is in a

1636
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:25,940
natural state or in a,
in a cultivated state where you know

1637
01:18:25,941 --> 01:18:30,160
you're splicing things and doing normal
things that people do gone like,

1638
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:35,200
like my favorite target topic,
haven't we got just the wrong way?

1639
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:37,670
Well,
we've definitely gone away,

1640
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,680
you know,
but that way that we've gone in in the

1641
01:18:40,681 --> 01:18:44,090
negative ways is terrible.
But in the positive ways of things like

1642
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:48,170
golden rice,
that's allowed thousands if not millions

1643
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:52,160
of people to not starve to death because
it's rice that was infused with protein.

1644
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:55,940
There's a bunch of different things that
we've done to ensure the shelf life of

1645
01:18:55,941 --> 01:18:56,240
foods.

1646
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:00,890
So get the food to the hungry people
because these foods can last longer.

1647
01:19:00,891 --> 01:19:03,680
Like tomatoes,
they look kind of fucked up now because

1648
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:08,360
they're hard and you know that these
also can stay on the shelves for a lot

1649
01:19:08,361 --> 01:19:08,991
longer.
Like,

1650
01:19:08,991 --> 01:19:10,610
and this goes back to what we're talking
about,

1651
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:14,570
like post World War II,
people were terrified of scarcity.

1652
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:18,680
There were terrified of famine and they
were terrified of the idea of going back

1653
01:19:18,681 --> 01:19:22,910
to war again and not having a stockpile
of food and resources.

1654
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,290
So this is it all.
It's all bad now.

1655
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:29,300
It's all bad when you go down the food
aisle and most of this shit has sugar in

1656
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:33,900
it and simple refined carbohydrates and
it's killing people and giving people

1657
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:37,230
just organic markets are mostly.
Yeah.

1658
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,050
I try to get organic farmers markets to
farmers.

1659
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,900
I liked the feeling I got was growing
the tomatoes.

1660
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:48,680
Yeah.
You walk it fucking supermarkets and the

1661
01:19:48,681 --> 01:19:53,600
bright lights all the fucking.
It feels like you've walked into that

1662
01:19:53,601 --> 01:19:55,130
corporate death,
you know,

1663
01:19:55,131 --> 01:19:56,960
and they call sugar white death,
right?

1664
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,160
Yeah,
it is.

1665
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:59,053
I mean,
it's,

1666
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,210
you're not supposed to have a sweet
tooth too.

1667
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:04,270
I have a lot of things to work on.
It's so fun.

1668
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:06,500
You know,
I get overwhelmed by that shit.

1669
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:07,980
I get like,
God

1670
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:09,540
damn it.
You know,

1671
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,950
and,
and check this out.

1672
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:12,870
I've,
I've been working out with a trainer for

1673
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:17,360
the last year and a half,
three times a week with like this guy a

1674
01:20:17,361 --> 01:20:18,151
lot.
Yeah.

1675
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:22,590
But you know,
I'm such an idiot that I work with them

1676
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:23,490
and I'm like,
well,

1677
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:25,320
I'm okay,
I'm good.

1678
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,570
Now I can have this shit.
You know what I mean?

1679
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:31,730
It's insane what I do like my little
reward.

1680
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,030
I've,
I've liked that child.

1681
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:37,230
I'm a child who is lights when the
lights are so funny.

1682
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,050
I got to fucking change that other part
of you.

1683
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,640
And you know,
it's so funny because we're having this

1684
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:47,170
conversation and what happens to me is
I'll be driving ongoing.

1685
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,780
Well,
that's fucking it.

1686
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,480
This is my state of state of mind.
I'll go,

1687
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:53,820
that's fucking it.
You know,

1688
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,050
this is.
Yeah,

1689
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:58,120
a fucking Rogan.
You know,

1690
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,160
he just hammered home.

1691
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,680
What I already know about,
you know,

1692
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:03,000
it's,
it's got it.

1693
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:05,440
The sugar's got to go.
The process.

1694
01:21:05,441 --> 01:21:07,740
CARBS got to go.
Then you said cupcake.

1695
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:14,010
The fucking rationalizations and
justifications of really style.

1696
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,840
It's fucking new year.
Yeah.

1697
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,240
It's almost Christmas.
It's almost thanksgiving.

1698
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:21,990
Thanksgiving is another 360 days.
Yeah.

1699
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:24,860
It's normal that I'm on a shoot in,
in June,

1700
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:26,300
in January.
Uh,

1701
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:27,670
and I'm like,
ah,

1702
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,360
they don't have any good food here.
I gotta have something,

1703
01:21:30,361 --> 01:21:31,250
you know what I mean?
It is.

1704
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,540
I'll have a cookie.
Yeah,

1705
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,000
it's a bitch.
You gotta write it down.

1706
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:39,030
Write down what you want to do.
Write down what you're allowed to eat.

1707
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:42,570
Someone else.
So a couple of the people told me the

1708
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:47,190
write down thing helps writing down,
writing down things helps with

1709
01:21:47,191 --> 01:21:50,610
everything I wrote down on that because
you now you have to,

1710
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:53,320
you have an obligation.
It's like one of the things that uh,

1711
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:55,080
uh,
Thompson,

1712
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:58,530
Bert Kreischer and Arusha fear and I did
sober October.

1713
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,990
Oh yeah.
You went through all that.

1714
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,660
No booze,
no pod.

1715
01:22:02,661 --> 01:22:05,130
You liked that?
It was educational.

1716
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:07,560
I think it's important to do.
I think it's good to do.

1717
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:11,070
I think I liked pot.
I'm a big fan and I like the occasional

1718
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:13,230
drink.
I like a glass of wine with dinner.

1719
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:16,530
I like that.
But it's also good to abstain.

1720
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:19,170
Just having an addictive personality.
I do,

1721
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:20,670
but I don't.
I do,

1722
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,170
but I don't let it.
I,

1723
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,100
I,
you will it?

1724
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,930
Yeah.
I keep that bitch in check,

1725
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:30,140
but I can let it go crazy if I wanted to
quit pot because I felt interesting,

1726
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,760
like I just would love to smoke all the
time and I'd be like,

1727
01:22:35,761 --> 01:22:36,870
well,
this movie,

1728
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,200
I'd be like,
this movie's going to be great on it.

1729
01:22:39,201 --> 01:22:40,270
Fucking Joe.
Yeah,

1730
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:41,740
it's.
Hi Tanya.

1731
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,360
Tonya.
It's kind of like,

1732
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:49,590
like to me what pot did it was like this
got to make like cvs and I'm going to

1733
01:22:51,331 --> 01:22:56,331
cvs and if I smoke it's going to be a
fun fucking trip because Weirdos at CV,

1734
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:01,770
especially in silver lake,
but you know what I mean.

1735
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,030
So,
so.

1736
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,860
But what happened was that I felt like I
wasn't

1737
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:10,480
doing my creative work.
Like what happened was the weed was

1738
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:12,070
taking me totally.
Again,

1739
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:14,410
I'm a child like taking me totally into
this.

1740
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:18,730
I just want to pleasure myself the whole
day and I couldn't buckle down and do

1741
01:23:18,731 --> 01:23:22,420
work with.
That's a real problem with comics that a

1742
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:26,950
lot of us struggle with.
Having the kind of discipline that's

1743
01:23:26,951 --> 01:23:29,710
required to get work done.
You know?

1744
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:33,280
It's like you're really funny,
but you don't produce any new stuff

1745
01:23:33,281 --> 01:23:38,270
because you're impulsive because you're
kind of silly.

1746
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:42,190
I think writing things down helps a lot.
Having rules that was going to say about

1747
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:45,670
this sober October thing.
I knew that I couldn't do any of this

1748
01:23:45,671 --> 01:23:49,840
thing and I knew that I had to do 15,
90 minute yoga sessions in this month.

1749
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,500
We had a rule and we were also
accountable to each other,

1750
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,150
so we all knew that we had to get this
done.

1751
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,500
Community.
Yeah.

1752
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,330
Community and,
and you know,

1753
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:00,940
talking shit to each other on text
messages all the time,

1754
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,250
you know,
like we were constantly fucking with

1755
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:04,690
each other and having a good time.
I mean,

1756
01:24:04,691 --> 01:24:06,430
it was really fun.
It was really fun,

1757
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:09,550
but it was also very educational.
But knowing that I have these

1758
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:11,860
requirements,
so I give myself requirements.

1759
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:14,410
I write down things every day,
every month,

1760
01:24:14,411 --> 01:24:16,000
every week,
every week or every.

1761
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,800
Occasionally it's daily.
If,

1762
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:19,360
uh,
this is like a big list of Shit I have

1763
01:24:19,361 --> 01:24:22,870
to do,
but like I have to write five days a

1764
01:24:22,871 --> 01:24:25,000
week.
I have to write for one hour,

1765
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:26,800
five days a week.
You have to.

1766
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:29,980
That's where the stuff comes from and if
I write more hours,

1767
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,690
great.
That's great.

1768
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:35,470
But at least five hours a week.
What if I miss a day?

1769
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:38,290
If something happens the next day I
require two hours.

1770
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:38,770
Okay.

1771
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:42,670
So you know around to a plan.
You have two other ones.

1772
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,830
Do that with food and you do it with.
Yeah.

1773
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:48,760
See that's what I do also for food.
I do intermittent fasting.

1774
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:51,760
This is my rule where I only eat for 10
hours a day.

1775
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:54,100
So for 14 hours a day I don't eat at
all.

1776
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:58,300
So whatever that cutoff is.
So say if I eat my last meal,

1777
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:02,080
my last bite,
I don't eat until 10:00 in the morning

1778
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:04,510
the next day period.
So if I get up at seven,

1779
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,580
that means for three hours I'm not
eating shit.

1780
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:09,700
I'll work out.
I'll maybe have some coffee.

1781
01:25:09,701 --> 01:25:11,620
Yeah,
I do a lot of workouts with no food.

1782
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:14,230
That's cool to do.
I always think,

1783
01:25:14,231 --> 01:25:15,550
oh,
I'm going to get low blood sugar in

1784
01:25:15,551 --> 01:25:16,930
paths out.
No,

1785
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:17,710
that's bullshit,
Huh?

1786
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:18,540
Yeah,
you'd be fine.

1787
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,810
It'll be fine.
It's just harder.

1788
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:22,570
It's just you don't feel good while
you're doing it.

1789
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:23,261
Yeah,
yeah,

1790
01:25:23,261 --> 01:25:24,490
yeah.
But if you're used to doing it,

1791
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,320
you can't have coffee.
Yeah.

1792
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,800
Coffee.
Yes.

1793
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,550
That helps suppress your appetite and it
gives you a little,

1794
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,150
a little pick me up.
Yeah.

1795
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:33,910
It's a psychological boost,
you know,

1796
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:34,960
like,
have a nice cup of coffee,

1797
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:36,520
then I'll go hit the gym.
Yeah.

1798
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:39,250
But I definitely feel better if I have
something to eat first.

1799
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:42,370
You know,
it's amazing how I resist structure.

1800
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,080
Of course.
You're a funny man.

1801
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:44,980
Uh,
this is,

1802
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:47,940
this is a reoccurring theme with so many
funny friends.

1803
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:50,140
It is crazy impulsive,
funny,

1804
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:54,940
but you're also the guy where if there's
a group of people sitting around and

1805
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:58,210
they're all a bunch of fucking suits and
they're all boring people,

1806
01:25:58,211 --> 01:26:01,780
I'm going to gravitate immediately to
you because you and I are going to talk

1807
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:02,170
real.

1808
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:04,910
We're going to be silly and you're going
to say some fucked up shit that I'm

1809
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:08,120
going to laugh at and we're going to be
slapping each other on the back and how

1810
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,280
that's what you do.
Men.

1811
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,970
But you have to,
you gotta manage

1812
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:19,160
this Portland with me.
I swear to God,

1813
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:20,980
you know,
I'm so anti corporate.

1814
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:21,771
Um,
um,

1815
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:25,460
so kind of an anti anti government.
I don't know what this anti

1816
01:26:25,461 --> 01:26:27,300
authoritarian streak,
you know,

1817
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:30,830
it might've been from my dad who was the
Sicilian motherfucker,

1818
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:35,831
right.
I any kind of course construction.

1819
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,000
Right.
But stop and think about this.

1820
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,720
You're talking in a microphone that was
made by a corporation you got here,

1821
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:45,260
I texted you on your phone,
which was made by slave labor in China.

1822
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:50,060
You got here and your car,
which was probably constructed overseas,

1823
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:50,661
right?
Yeah.

1824
01:26:50,661 --> 01:26:51,441
Honda.
Yeah.

1825
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:55,130
See,
this is we need corporations because you

1826
01:26:55,131 --> 01:26:57,640
and I are not going to build fucking
planes.

1827
01:26:57,990 --> 01:27:02,750
Okay.
Boeing is required to make sure those

1828
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:06,530
planes get done correctly.
I just want them to do it in a way

1829
01:27:06,531 --> 01:27:10,510
that's a gala tyrion and not fucking
over people and you know,

1830
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:14,090
but it's just like,
it's really convenient to put that Che

1831
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:17,830
Guevara tee shirt on and fuck that guy
guy.

1832
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:19,770
Fuck Society Man.
I mean it's,

1833
01:27:19,771 --> 01:27:24,530
it's so tempting.
And in your inclinations are all

1834
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:26,660
correct.
Your heart is in the right place,

1835
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:29,460
you're your instincts are all good.
He's like you.

1836
01:27:29,461 --> 01:27:32,960
You don't want people to get fucked over
and you rightly realized that a lot of

1837
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:37,160
this materialism and this fucking
corporate bullshit is pointless.

1838
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,900
If,
like you said at the beginning of this

1839
01:27:38,901 --> 01:27:41,570
podcast,
we're all going to die and we need to

1840
01:27:41,571 --> 01:27:46,571
face that and stopped just collecting
shit and instead work on having a great

1841
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:50,810
experience in the moment because this
moment that you have right now,

1842
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:54,530
this is all you'll ever have,
is the moment you can plan to make that

1843
01:27:54,531 --> 01:27:58,970
moment better in the future with more
discipline and more structure and more

1844
01:27:58,971 --> 01:28:03,680
happiness and and even more like
scheduling community events and

1845
01:28:03,681 --> 01:28:04,880
scheduling things.

1846
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:08,330
You think you know military.
It's hilarious that I don't know any

1847
01:28:08,331 --> 01:28:09,590
military.
I know a lot.

1848
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:10,513
Yeah,
no law.

1849
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,730
Is the discipline good for the gigantic.
Huge.

1850
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:15,920
My friend Jocko,
he wrote Jocko Willink,

1851
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:18,020
wrote a book called discipline equals
freedom.

1852
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,530
See,
that's what I need to fucking go toward.

1853
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,620
Do you need to follow Jocko?
Every morning at 4:30 in the morning,

1854
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,740
he posts a picture of his watch as he
gets up to work out,

1855
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:30,420
which is named Jocko willink.
I'll,

1856
01:28:30,421 --> 01:28:31,670
uh,
I'll send you his instagram,

1857
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:33,530
send to this,
but he's a,

1858
01:28:33,770 --> 01:28:36,740
he's a,
like a bonafide savage navy seal and the

1859
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:41,790
guys God damn animal and every morning
at 4:30 he works out and then he goes

1860
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:45,020
and watches the sun,
come up on the beach and that is his

1861
01:28:45,021 --> 01:28:46,820
reward.
That's his reward.

1862
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:50,330
So he gives himself that.
It's all this stuff done that he has to

1863
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:51,080
do during the day.

1864
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:56,080
See the aftermath.
Like he'll post pictures of like his go

1865
01:28:56,961 --> 01:29:01,290
to is actual page and see all the photos
of his watch for 30 2:00 AM there is up

1866
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:04,320
and you know,
his heart in the right place to,

1867
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,400
oh,
he's a good guy,

1868
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:06,660
great guy,
great guy.

1869
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:11,661
And he spends a lot of his time right
now I'm doing these corporate seminars

1870
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,000
and uh,
you know,

1871
01:29:13,001 --> 01:29:17,370
like explaining to people the importance
of leadership and discipline and that,

1872
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,780
you know,
is this how you get things done is say

1873
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:21,990
you feel better.
This is how you relieve yourself of your

1874
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:24,420
demons,
your tension and his concept of

1875
01:29:24,421 --> 01:29:28,920
discipline equals freedom really
resonates because if you have the

1876
01:29:28,921 --> 01:29:33,240
discipline to get things done,
then you feel like I don't feel good

1877
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:35,700
unless I've accomplished this shit I
need to do,

1878
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,740
but when I have accomplished should I
need to do,

1879
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:43,010
then I like to kick back on the couch
and watch a boxing match or a television

1880
01:29:44,641 --> 01:29:45,540
show that I enjoy.

1881
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,030
I can enjoy it where I don't have
anxiety,

1882
01:29:48,031 --> 01:29:51,030
I have fucking anxiety if I don't get
things done.

1883
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,640
I think that's,
you know,

1884
01:29:52,641 --> 01:29:57,360
it's funny because I started the podcast
talking about anxiety ed and I'm

1885
01:29:57,361 --> 01:30:02,361
thinking it's all about community and
disconnection and for me it may be this

1886
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:08,091
just a more kind kinda days I have
instead of fucking going,

1887
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:09,211
okay,
I'm going to do this,

1888
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:12,960
this and this to give me a little
structure that would probably alleviate

1889
01:30:12,961 --> 01:30:16,080
a bunch of a bunch of it.
But community is important too.

1890
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:18,410
We fucking need each other.
You know,

1891
01:30:18,411 --> 01:30:20,460
it's one of the,
like we were talking about the comedy

1892
01:30:20,461 --> 01:30:23,160
store and I wish everybody had something
like the comedy store,

1893
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,410
you know,
I used to have a pool hall lot I used to

1894
01:30:25,411 --> 01:30:29,070
go to that was like that where I would
be everywhere I would be.

1895
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:29,731
I'd be like,
ah,

1896
01:30:29,731 --> 01:30:32,340
I can't wait to get back to executive
billiards and hang out with all my

1897
01:30:32,341 --> 01:30:35,270
friends.
And it was like this freak show where it

1898
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,430
was all these Weirdos was ambler,
white plains,

1899
01:30:38,431 --> 01:30:39,051
New York.
Oh,

1900
01:30:39,051 --> 01:30:42,510
okay.
And all these Weirdos and gamblers and

1901
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:47,070
strange little outcasts of society and
lifelong bachelors who were in their

1902
01:30:47,071 --> 01:30:51,630
seventies and we'd all get together and
laugh and hang out until fucking 4:00 in

1903
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:54,480
the morning and then go get something to
eat and a comic.

1904
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:58,950
But this was like a home base and I
think the comedy store and a lot of

1905
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:01,050
ways.
Delis.

1906
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:04,680
Hey,
let's wrap this bitch up.

1907
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,060
It's 2:00 already.
Okay.

1908
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:07,800
How quick was that?
Just went by.

1909
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:08,760
It was great.
Eddie.

1910
01:31:08,761 --> 01:31:09,600
I had a good time,
man.

1911
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:13,470
Often I had a great time and and I think
I'm going to change my life.

1912
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:17,850
Change Eddie pepitone,
