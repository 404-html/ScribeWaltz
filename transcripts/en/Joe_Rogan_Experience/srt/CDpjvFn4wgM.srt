1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,530
Here we go.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,190
Five,

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,023
four,

4
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,893
three,

5
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,993
two,

6
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,223
one.

7
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,380
Cool.

8
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,213
Hello Johan.

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,600
Hi.

10
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,440
Was Christ what's happening?

11
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:14,861
Yeah.

12
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:15,161
Good.

13
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:15,550
I've just,

14
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,730
we'd just say before we went on camera
that I'd met a note to myself that says,

15
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,810
talk slow,

16
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,800
Talk American,

17
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,870
because although I spent
about half the year here,

18
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:23,621
we British people,

19
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:27,640
but there's a reorientation where you
suddenly realize I was once in a UN,

20
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,570
I hop in Cactus Arizona and
I was saying to the woman,

21
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:31,841
right,

22
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,010
like I'll have some pancakes,

23
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:33,844
whatever it was.

24
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,380
And she kept looking at me going,

25
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,483
what?

26
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,640
I don't have to about
literally three minutes.

27
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:40,474
She goes,

28
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,550
do you speak English?

29
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:42,960
I was like,

30
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,340
Ooh,

31
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,680
my people fucking invented it.

32
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,070
Right.

33
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,980
But no one was there to
laugh at my subject because
they didn't understand what

34
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:48,750
the fuck I was saying.

35
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:48,840
I,

36
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,080
Arizona is a strange place.

37
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,400
I really love Arizona.

38
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,360
There's great parts.

39
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:53,830
Like Phoenix is amazing.

40
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:55,060
Tucson's a great place too,

41
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:57,850
but it's a wild west sort of a state.

42
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,960
It's one of those weird hold over states
that have a lot of weird old school

43
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:02,321
laws.

44
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:02,950
Like,

45
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,281
like,

46
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:03,550
uh,

47
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,980
I think you could just
walk around with a gun.

48
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,390
Yeah,

49
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,910
you can't.

50
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,840
My main experience in Phoenix
was in Arizona in fact,

51
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,680
was going out with a group of women
who were made to go out on a chain gang

52
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,950
wearing tee shirts saying I was a drug
addict who are members of the public,

53
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:20,980
mock them in Jira at the
right cause written this book
about where I spoke about

54
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,040
the war on drugs and I went to Joe Arpaio,

55
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:23,531
sheriff,

56
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,190
our pio,

57
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,570
no longer sheriff now thankfully.

58
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,404
But uh,

59
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,711
yeah,

60
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,161
and it was,

61
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:27,371
yeah,

62
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:28,900
Arizona is a deeply weird place.

63
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,763
It's weird.

64
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,570
A lot of really nice people,

65
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,240
but it's 150,000 degrees.

66
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:34,600
Yeah.

67
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,231
Well literally,

68
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:37,630
almost nobody lived there until
I conditioning was invented.

69
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,140
Right.

70
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,940
And you see what I once
met a horrendous mistake,

71
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:43,420
in fact in Phoenix where I had to walk
somewhere and I could see on the map,

72
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,380
it was like a mile away.

73
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,711
So I was like,

74
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:44,830
oh,

75
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,371
just walk.

76
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,060
It's fine.

77
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,430
And I get like halfway there and people
are literally stopping that car is

78
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:48,850
going,

79
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,631
are you okay?

80
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:53,170
Because the only reason anyone would ever
walk in Phoenix was basically if your

81
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:54,910
car had broken down in a car to them,

82
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,890
I might have actually just chosen to walk.

83
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:57,490
Right.

84
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,110
Plus you're so white guy.

85
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:03,880
I'm like a tomato and used to come out
with a Brazilian who would literally just

86
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:05,800
look at my body and laugh and be like,

87
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,070
you're so white.

88
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,960
How can a human be so white?

89
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,540
I don't also,

90
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,590
I never have a nice color.

91
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:14,550
Like I'm either this
albino color or red rock.

92
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,100
I never,

93
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,430
there's no rich brown hue have,

94
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:17,620
uh,

95
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,580
none of my ancestors,

96
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,470
the Scottish and Swiss.

97
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,080
So they never saw the start.

98
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,380
Right.

99
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,710
And none of my ancestors,

100
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,380
my friend Jamie was over my house
once and he's not this friend Jamie at

101
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,214
different friend Jamie,

102
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,980
who's a British as well.

103
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,270
And my daughter,

104
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:31,940
who was a,

105
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,501
at the time,

106
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:34,720
I think she was like 10
or something like that.

107
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,441
She goes,

108
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:36,680
she goes to my watch,

109
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:36,881
he goes,

110
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:37,241
mommy,

111
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,230
he's so white.

112
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:38,960
She,

113
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,521
and she goes,

114
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:39,731
yeah.

115
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:40,031
She goes,

116
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:40,161
no,

117
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:40,201
no,

118
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:40,600
no,

119
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,530
like he's white,

120
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:42,364
like paper.

121
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,190
So from then on,

122
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:46,840
Jamie became Jamie White,

123
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:47,674
like paper.

124
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,000
Very accurate description of
my lack of pigment is curly.

125
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:52,390
True.

126
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,260
It's funny though,

127
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,600
how much we appreciate
the English accent though.

128
00:02:55,601 --> 00:03:00,220
The English accent is like one of the
best tools for selling things to very

129
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,270
gullible Americans.

130
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,240
Whether it's like people benefit from
constant positive discrimination in the

131
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:04,781
United States,

132
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:05,080
right?

133
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,460
It's like having a 10 inch deck,

134
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,600
just having a British accent.

135
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,521
Oh my God,

136
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,620
you got an exit.

137
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,460
All humans have accents.

138
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:12,980
I've just got,

139
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,150
you know,

140
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,550
let's say a cherished one.

141
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,010
We looked at.

142
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,630
Really,

143
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,840
it makes you feel like
you're more sophisticated.

144
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:20,141
You're,

145
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,420
you're more well read.

146
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,430
You're more aware of the world.

147
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:24,671
I mean,

148
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,760
I just am sophisticated
and wild ride anyway.

149
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,760
No,

150
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,080
but you get this constant.

151
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,101
Yeah.

152
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:30,581
Constantly.

153
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:34,270
People are ascribing to you much better
qualities then you actually have,

154
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,010
but what does it work in reverse?

155
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,411
Like in,

156
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:37,181
in England?

157
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,510
What is the reaction to American
accents is it's mostly discussed,

158
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,344
right?

159
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,540
There's a mixture.

160
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,470
Americans,

161
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,000
we grow.

162
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,650
I always think like the relationship
with Britain and America,

163
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:52,180
it's like I'm one of those police mirrors
because we grow up constantly looking

164
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,050
at the United States,

165
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,321
right?

166
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,700
We're constantly staring through.

167
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,760
We are immersed in American culture,

168
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:57,190
right?

169
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,870
But when Americans look back at us,

170
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,520
they're just seeing like a
reflection of themselves.

171
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:00,701
I mean,

172
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:03,340
Americans watched Downton Abbey and
know about like the queen or whatever,

173
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,260
but there isn't that two way
dialogue that there is that the,

174
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:07,481
the,

175
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:07,721
the,

176
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:08,554
you know,

177
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,041
yeah.

178
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,240
So it's a slightly weird,

179
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,300
so I think we feel very American.

180
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:13,580
Ryan,

181
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,020
I spent half of the
year here and you know,

182
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,690
every now and then you come up against
these deep cultural differences that it

183
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,380
just like,

184
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:20,741
oh fuck,

185
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:20,921
okay.

186
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:21,101
Right.

187
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,450
This is really not my culture.

188
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:22,661
Right?

189
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:26,620
And it's those moments of disorientation
a really strange like gimme one,

190
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:27,520
if we're going example,

191
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,750
well this is a question
Americans ask all the time,

192
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,960
but I have literally never
heard of European ass,

193
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,920
right?

194
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,641
I asked the question,

195
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,510
what's your story?

196
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,551
Every American,

197
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,080
you can go to the most crusty,

198
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,890
right wing person coming out of Mara
Largo or a kid in West Baltimore and you

199
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:45,570
can say,

200
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:45,741
well,

201
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:46,361
it's your story.

202
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:47,320
And they'll have an answer.

203
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,230
The only context I can imagine
a British person saying,

204
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,100
what's your story?

205
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,990
Would be in a police interrogation.

206
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:54,760
It would be an extremely hostile question.

207
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,230
What's your story?

208
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:56,591
Right?

209
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,424
It would be,

210
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,020
you just wouldn't ever say it,

211
00:04:59,021 --> 00:04:59,141
right?

212
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:02,710
We don't Americans narrativize their
lives in a way I absolutely love.

213
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:03,401
And as a journalist,

214
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,730
he writes books about like depression
and addiction and you want people to talk

215
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,270
about their lives.

216
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,070
It's an unbelievable gift t right?

217
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,720
That people will tell you.

218
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:14,710
So I remember once being on a bus in
Mississippi and sitting next to a woman,

219
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,040
and within five minutes
of chatting to her,

220
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,060
she told me about like
her two miscarriages,

221
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,410
how her mother hated her.

222
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,210
And I thought if we were Swiss,

223
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,200
where my dad's from,

224
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,510
you wouldn't tell me this
until we got married.

225
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,590
And maybe not even that.

226
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,130
Right?

227
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,330
So there's a level of candor and
storytelling among Americans.

228
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,770
It's one of the best things about this,

229
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,281
this,

230
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:33,671
this,

231
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:34,001
you know,

232
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,350
fucked up and amazing place,

233
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,110
right?

234
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,943
I just love it.

235
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,601
There's something about,

236
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,110
there's a,

237
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,160
there's a kind of a narrative openness
that's very different about this place

238
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:42,611
than Europe.

239
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:43,444
Anywhere in Europe.

240
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,810
Now when you talk to people in England,

241
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,310
you guys don't have the
same level of social,

242
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,211
not social media,

243
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,220
but of reality television.

244
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,170
You have some like big brother,

245
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,160
but you don't have to
the extent that we have

246
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,431
it here,

247
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:58,700
right?

248
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,001
Yeah,

249
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,750
it hasn't.

250
00:05:59,750 --> 00:05:59,901
Well,

251
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,720
I mean your country has literally
been taken over by reality television,

252
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:02,901
right?

253
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,240
We have a royalty and president.

254
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,030
Uh,

255
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,241
no,

256
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:05,630
it hasn't

257
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,280
conquered the whole culture in that way.

258
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:07,791
Well,

259
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,410
he's a reality television president,

260
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,450
but he's sort of a game
show host president.

261
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,780
Like that's how I used to describe
myself and I was hosting fear factor.

262
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,321
They were like,

263
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:16,550
you hosted reality show Mike,

264
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,690
sort of.

265
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,740
It's a game show.

266
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,510
It's just a fucked up game show.

267
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:21,100
It's like,

268
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,380
and Trump was hosting a
game show essentially.

269
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:24,621
Right?

270
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,790
It was a contest.

271
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,580
It wasn't like keeping
up with the Kardashians.

272
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,241
That's interest.

273
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,380
True reality show.

274
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,590
Because there's literally nothing going
on other than these people's lives and

275
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,810
whatever orchestrated bullshit they
put in to make it more interesting.

276
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,321
Yeah.

277
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,280
I hadn't thought of it that way.

278
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,390
I think that's cool because,

279
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,930
but I think that's part of the
thing that I was getting to about.

280
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:45,410
Uh,

281
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,050
Americans always wanted to
give you their narrative.

282
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,330
They always want to give
you the story of their life.

283
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,290
So when someone says,

284
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,011
what's your story?

285
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:52,940
They already have it ready.

286
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,990
You know,

287
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,990
because it's almost like we feel like
we're in some sort of a small television

288
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,790
show all the time or some
sort of small production.

289
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,520
It's like almost a part of our who we are.

290
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:04,810
Yeah.

291
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,300
Every American

292
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,220
can thinks that the star,

293
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:06,990
if there were a movie,

294
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,600
right.

295
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,470
And I forget who said this,

296
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,111
but someone realize,

297
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,610
you know,

298
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,680
sometimes in life you realize
you're just the extra,

299
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,673
right?

300
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,400
You're in the corner of the shot.

301
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:14,680
Right,

302
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,180
right.

303
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,401
And,

304
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:15,730
um,

305
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:15,881
yeah,

306
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:16,481
I think that's true.

307
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:16,961
And I think that's,

308
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:19,720
that's not as true of British people,

309
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,460
or I think there's certain,

310
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,040
how to put it like this,

311
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,570
a certain kind of self deprecation.

312
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:26,740
You're taught as a British person,

313
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:27,574
you're tall.

314
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,920
And I had to kind of
unlearn it living here.

315
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,420
So what would be examples?

316
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,010
Uh,

317
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,890
I forget where I read this story,

318
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:33,730
so maybe it's not true,

319
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,080
but I remember in it years ago,

320
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,740
so we had these terrible
subway bombs in 2005,

321
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:41,410
I'm sure you remember for young British
men go on to the London Underground and

322
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,520
murder,

323
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,310
I think it was over 50
people and two weeks later,

324
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,330
another group of,

325
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:46,980
um,

326
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,430
jihadis tried to do the same thing,

327
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,140
but they hadn't built the bombs very well.

328
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,200
So they go down into the subway and the,

329
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,340
there's a loud bang,

330
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,050
but it doesn't connect with a detonator.

331
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,310
So there's a loud bang,

332
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,420
but it doesn't actually blow everyone.

333
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,180
Obviously people freak the
fuck out as you can imagine.

334
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:01,960
Right.

335
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,793
And I forget,

336
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,970
maybe this isn't,

337
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,790
maybe this is a story that someone
told them that wasn't factually true,

338
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,031
but he's,

339
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:07,781
I think it reveals something.

340
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:08,110
Bri.

341
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,943
Bri,

342
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,520
something about British currents.

343
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,200
Uh,

344
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,280
so if I remember rightly,

345
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,360
um,

346
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,420
three of the bombers escape escape on
the day in a court like a few hours later

347
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:17,950
and one of them's caught on at the time,

348
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:18,141
right.

349
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:18,820
And someone,

350
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,720
I think it was an off duty fire officer
in the story chases after them for ages,

351
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:25,870
chasing after the guy for ages while
everyone else is running the fuck away.

352
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,720
And it catches the guy and
he throws him to the ground.

353
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:29,770
And what he said to him was,

354
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,950
the off duty pharmacist says to
the attempted suicide bomber,

355
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,150
you rude,

356
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,110
rude man.

357
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,010
Right.

358
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,010
And what I love about that is like the
idea of the suicide bombing is just like

359
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:39,844
bad manners.

360
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,100
It's like it's just impolite,

361
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,520
right?

362
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,510
Or even a better example,

363
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:44,081
which is true.

364
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:44,861
It was reported at the time,

365
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:45,431
definitely was,

366
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:45,910
um,

367
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,980
during the riots we had in 2011,

368
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:48,791
uh,

369
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,624
in London,

370
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,410
um,

371
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,370
there was one place,

372
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,001
I forget where it is,

373
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:55,200
where they broke into a luxury goods
store and they could only make a,

374
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,840
it was very strong window so they could
only make a hole in the corner of the

375
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:02,560
window and it was caught on the security
cameras that the rioters formed align

376
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,050
to go in and loot the store.

377
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,560
Right.

378
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,370
That's how deep the idea of like Keurig
and make it align is in British culture.

379
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,420
Even in a riot were like,

380
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:09,870
oh no.

381
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,160
I think you where you were before me.

382
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:11,994
Right?

383
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,740
I've got a in front Isabelle Bank,

384
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:14,891
Hey,

385
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:15,401
he lives in,

386
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:16,530
he lives in London and she liked me.

387
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:17,840
If I've ever heard it
be up to she read that.

388
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,340
I'd be like,

389
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,300
you're fucking English.

390
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:19,571
You did it.

391
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:20,890
I have a riot this and I'm Roger.

392
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,621
Probably get cure.

393
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:22,810
What's wrong with you people?

394
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:23,140
Right?

395
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,770
You guys don't have black Friday sales.

396
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,680
You not with,

397
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,920
they've just started.

398
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:27,700
Yeah.

399
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,780
It's an unfortunate business.

400
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,980
Might be the end of humility.

401
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,121
Exactly.

402
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:31,954
We're not going to make it.

403
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,491
We survived.

404
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,980
The Nazis were not fucking
survived in black Friday.

405
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:36,520
Right.

406
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,090
There's something about those deals when
people get that bargain and then they

407
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:42,970
opened that door ready go
and people pile through.

408
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:47,260
All humanity gets tossed aside and get
you in this sign to the fucking financial

409
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:49,000
desperation of ordinary Americans.

410
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:49,211
Right?

411
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:50,260
It's a little bit of that,

412
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:53,800
but it's also the competitive nature of
those things where you're trying to grab

413
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:58,801
the few remaining items that are 25%
off and even saving for this TV for six

414
00:09:59,081 --> 00:09:59,501
months.

415
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:02,860
And there it is right in front of you and
he charge and people are fighting left

416
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:03,251
and right.

417
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:04,050
It's awful.

418
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,080
It says it's just a terrible
way for people to interact

419
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,933
with each other.

420
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,180
Oh,

421
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,901
so a,

422
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:12,890
what are you going to hear from me?

423
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,640
So we were going to talk about,

424
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,493
yeah,

425
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,701
I was wearing,

426
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:19,100
she told you because we talked last
time about my book about depression loss

427
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:20,900
conditions and one thing,

428
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:23,090
it was just as me as
we talk about the book,

429
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:27,410
I write about addiction and the war on
drugs and really was that out last time

430
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:30,680
you get a book that came up for you just
come out in a new edition where there's

431
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:34,220
loads of extra material particular about
the opiate crisis and essentially cause

432
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,240
so you added to it.

433
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:35,541
Yeah.

434
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:39,090
Loads of new stuff because the epics
about five years old now and um,

435
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,340
although with loads of new stuff now,

436
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:41,890
but you know,

437
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,110
it was something I cared about for this
really like personal reason in that one

438
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,550
of my earliest memories is to trying
to wake up one of my relatives and not,

439
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,221
not being able to,

440
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:50,030
I didn't,

441
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,160
I didn't understand why
then because was little boy.

442
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,790
But as I got older I realized we had
drug addiction in my family and it got to

443
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,470
the point where I was writing,

444
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,770
chasing the scream or
book about the drug war,

445
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,623
about,

446
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,310
I guess I started eight years ago and
some of the people I love when a really

447
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,720
shitty condition,

448
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,613
terrible state,

449
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,860
and I was trying to figure out what to do.

450
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,130
Nothing I was doing was working.

451
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,410
Nothing I was doing was helping.

452
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,660
And I decided,

453
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:14,781
right,

454
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:14,961
okay,

455
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:17,810
well there are lots of people all over
the world are trying to deal with this

456
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:18,644
problem.

457
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,880
I want to go and meet with them,

458
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:20,660
talk with them.

459
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,950
So I ended up going on this big journey.

460
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:22,731
It took three years.

461
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,140
I traveled over 30,000 miles.

462
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,490
I want it to sit with,

463
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,720
you know,

464
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,550
people who'd been through addiction.

465
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,490
It actually led to a lot of other
aspects of the war on drugs.

466
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,760
It doesn't count as important as the,

467
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,170
what we do about addiction.

468
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,100
Um,

469
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,280
I don't want to sit with the places that
had the harshest possible policies like

470
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:37,701
we mentioned,

471
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:41,310
Arizona where I went out with these women
were made to go out on chain gangs and

472
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:46,311
they're humiliated and tormented Vietnam
where they make people with addiction

473
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,450
problems go into literally forced labor
camps and the places that had the most

474
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:54,400
compassionate possible policies like
Portugal where they all drugs when

475
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,860
incredible results Switzerland
with they legalized heroin.

476
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:57,790
Incredible results.

477
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,913
Um,

478
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,750
and I guess I ended up
just spending so much time.

479
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,400
It's such a crazy mixture of people from,

480
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:03,790
uh,

481
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,040
you know,

482
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,090
transgendered crack dealer in Brooklyn
who ended up actually being one of the

483
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:11,230
smartest people I know to hit man for
the deadliest Mexican drug cartel who's

484
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,700
definitely not one of the
smartest people I know.

485
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,650
And I learned loads of things.

486
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:19,180
But I guess the heart of what I learned
is just so much of what we've been told

487
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,380
about this for so long.

488
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,990
It's now a hundred years since we
started fighting the war on drugs in this

489
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,210
country and it was then imposed
on the rest of the world.

490
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,890
So much of what we're told is wrong.

491
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,330
Drugs aren't what we think they are.

492
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,290
Addiction isn't what we think is the war
on drugs isn't what we think it is and

493
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,900
the alternatives to the war on
drugs and what we think they are.

494
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,960
So in some ways it's kind of daunting to
Rick go all over the world and realize

495
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,020
so much of what we take
for granted isn't right.

496
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:44,680
But that opens up this whole
exciting other set of possibilities.

497
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,750
The,

498
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,750
the main reason why people assumed that
people do drugs is to escape reality.

499
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,971
Um,

500
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,930
what do you think is the primary
thing that they're running from?

501
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,700
So you've got to separate out two things.

502
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:01,660
And this surprised me cause my
family's experience was pretty bad and

503
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:02,800
catastrophic addiction.

504
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,900
But most druggies,

505
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,700
even the main drug war body in the world,

506
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:11,650
the UN Office of drug control admits
that 90% of all currently banned drug use

507
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,210
is what they call non problematic.

508
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:15,340
So the person isn't addicted and
it doesn't damage their health,

509
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:15,790
right?

510
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,410
So 90% so let's set that aside.

511
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:18,240
We'll come back to that.

512
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,540
Okay.

513
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,120
That's like 90% that's recreational use
where people use because it makes their

514
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:22,954
lives better.

515
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,170
Then you've got the 10 Hoffie sip of
wine or or a or c or a whole range of a

516
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:31,150
whole range of currently cannabis,

517
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,620
a whole range of currently illegal drugs.

518
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,610
Um,

519
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,100
in most cases there are some people
who have addictions to cannabis,

520
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,140
but you said that you don't got,

521
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,770
got to ask,

522
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:38,891
well,

523
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:42,190
what's happening with this
10% who have got a problem?

524
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,400
Right?

525
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
What's going on?

526
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,540
And one of the things that really blew
my mind in the research we're chasing the

527
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,560
scream was realizing I had deeply
misunderstood what addiction is.

528
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:54,040
I had misunderstood the thing I thought
I had been seeing in front of me since I

529
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,521
was a kid.

530
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:55,354
Right?

531
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,230
So most people,

532
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:58,270
let's think about heroin addiction
because that's close to me.

533
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,981
Most people,

534
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:02,800
if we stop the next 20
people to walk past your,

535
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,551
you know,

536
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,390
your your studio,

537
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:04,961
and we said to them,

538
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,640
what causes heroin addiction?

539
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,620
I think they'd look at
us like we were stupid.

540
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:09,454
And they'd say,

541
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:09,851
well,

542
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:11,710
the clue's in the name dip shit,

543
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,220
right?

544
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,260
Heroin causes her.

545
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:14,094
In addition,

546
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,060
we've been told this
story for a hundred years.

547
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,530
It's become totally part of our,

548
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,820
our common sense,

549
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:19,510
right?

550
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,470
We think if we took the,

551
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,330
we took the next 20 people after that,

552
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:26,500
he walked past the studio and we injected
them all with heroin every day for a

553
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:26,950
month.

554
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,731
At the end of that month,

555
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,560
they'd all be heroin
addicts for simple reason.

556
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,790
There's chemical hooks in heroin that
their bodies would start to desperately

557
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,810
physically need.

558
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,410
Um,

559
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,930
and we think that a lot of people
think that's what addiction is,

560
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:38,141
right?

561
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:42,130
It's this physical hunger for the
chemical hook inside the drug,

562
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,993
right?

563
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,310
And there is some reality
to chemical hooks.

564
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:46,000
They exist.

565
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,720
They're real.

566
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,440
But that's actually a very
small part of what's going on.

567
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,160
The first thing that
alerted me to the fact

568
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,480
there's something wrong with that story
we've been told is when it was explained

569
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,190
to me by loads of doctors in Britain,

570
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,024
where I'm from,

571
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,900
if you step out into the street and you
get hit by a truck and you break your

572
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:03,680
hip,

573
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,440
you'll be taken to hospital and
you'll be given loads of a drug called

574
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,274
diamorphine.

575
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,750
Diamorphine is heroin,

576
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:08,961
right?

577
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,430
It's the medical name Vera minutes.

578
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,430
The stuff you'll be given in a hospital
is much better than the shit you buy on

579
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:15,230
the street because it's medically pure.

580
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:16,730
It's not contaminated.

581
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,610
And if what we think
about addiction is right,

582
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,610
that it's just caused
by exposure to the drug,

583
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,880
what should be happening to all these
people in British hospitals who have been

584
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:26,750
given loads of heroin,

585
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:27,080
right?

586
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,580
Anyone watching this podcast,

587
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,970
he's got a British grandmother who's
had a hip replacement operation.

588
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,890
Your grandmother's taken
a shit ton of heroin,

589
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,610
right?

590
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,110
And if what we think is right,

591
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:39,440
the addiction is caused primarily
by exposure to the chemical hooks,

592
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,380
lines of these people should believe
in hospital and trying to score on the

593
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:42,771
streets,

594
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,250
right?

595
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,600
This has been studied very Catholic,

596
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:45,650
but actually never happens.

597
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:46,484
Right?

598
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,600
And when I learned that,

599
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,690
it just seems so weird to me.

600
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,160
I thought it couldn't possibly be true,

601
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:52,790
right?

602
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,451
How could it be?

603
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,130
You've got someone in a hospital bed,

604
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:57,680
he's taking loads of really potent heroin,

605
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,300
they don't become addicted.

606
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,800
And in the alleyway outside,

607
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,730
you've got someone who's using
actually a weaker form of the drug.

608
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,961
He becomes addicted.

609
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:06,290
How can,

610
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:06,921
how can that be?

611
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:07,880
What's happening here?

612
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,130
And I only began to understand it when I,

613
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,350
when I went to Vancouver,

614
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:15,890
I met this amazing man could professor
Bruce Alexander who didn't experiment.

615
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,800
That's really transformed how we think
about addiction all over the world.

616
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,470
It's led to a new way of thinking
and loads of new evidence.

617
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,010
So professor Alexander explained to
me this story that we'd been told,

618
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:25,340
right?

619
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,380
That addiction is caused
by the chemical hooks,

620
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,310
primarily comes from a series
of experiments that were
done earlier in the 20th

621
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:31,880
century.

622
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,140
They're really simple experiments.

623
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:36,320
Your viewers can try them at home if
they're feeling a little bit shitty today,

624
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,010
right?

625
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,880
You take a rat,

626
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,800
you put it in a cage,

627
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,450
and you give it two water bottles.

628
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,680
One is just water and the other is water
laced with either heroin or cocaine.

629
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:49,190
You might remember in the 1980s there's
a famous partnership for drug free

630
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,830
America ad that shows this experiment,

631
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:52,490
right?

632
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,860
And the rat in this cage starts to drink.

633
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:59,861
The PF always prefers the heroin water
and almost always kills itself within a

634
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:00,621
week or two,

635
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:01,280
right?

636
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,940
So there you go.

637
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,230
That's,

638
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,850
that's our story that
you're exposed to the drug.

639
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,370
It takes you over and then you just die,

640
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,270
right?

641
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,150
But in the 70s professor
Alexander comes along and says,

642
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:13,850
he was working with people with
addiction problems and he's like,

643
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,301
well,

644
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,134
hang on a minute.

645
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,460
We put these rats alone in an empty cage.

646
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,550
They've got nothing that makes
life meaningful for rats,

647
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:23,270
right?

648
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,980
What would happen if we
did this differently?

649
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,740
So he built a cage that
he called rat park,

650
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:29,660
which is basically like having a rat's,

651
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:30,320
right?

652
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,490
They've got loads of friends,

653
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:32,420
they've got loads of cheese,

654
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,530
they've got as a colored balls,

655
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:34,550
they can have loads of sex.

656
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,760
Anything arap finds meaningful
in life is there in rat park.

657
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,350
And they've got both the water bottles,

658
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,300
the normal water and the drug border.

659
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:42,380
And of course they try both.

660
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:43,214
They don't know what's in them.

661
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,770
This is the fascinating thing in rat park,

662
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,510
they didn't like the Waterbury much.

663
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,650
None of them ever use it compulsively.

664
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,100
The heroin

665
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,090
was the heroin water.

666
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,010
None of them ever use it compulsively.

667
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,360
None of them have overdose.

668
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,680
So you go from almost a hundred percent
compulsive use and death by overdose

669
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,770
when their lives are shitty to none.

670
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,660
When they have the things
that make life meaningful.

671
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:04,830
And there's loads of human examples.

672
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:05,930
I'm sure we'll we'll,

673
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:06,691
we'll talk about,

674
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:07,170
but the,

675
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,530
the main thing I took from this is
that the opposite of addiction is not

676
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:10,981
sobriety.

677
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,570
The opposite of addiction is connection.

678
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,620
We have to ask ourselves what are the
contexts in which people become addicted?

679
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,160
Because there are some contexts where
people buying these drugs extremely

680
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:23,910
addictive and there are some context
where they don't become addicted at all.

681
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,230
This something,

682
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,790
the drug plays a role.

683
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,541
Chemical x are real.

684
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,850
I can talk about how we know
that they play some role,

685
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,570
but they're actually a surprisingly small
role of what's going small amount of

686
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,404
what's going on.

687
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,100
We know this from,

688
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,281
I mean,

689
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,120
there's so many examples,

690
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:36,570
but I'll give you,

691
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,510
give me another one in at
the same time as rat park,

692
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,900
there was an experiment going on that
everyone listens to this repair of the

693
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:44,940
Vietnam war in Vietnam.

694
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,670
Shitloads of American
troops were using heroin,

695
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:47,971
right?

696
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:50,340
It was very easy to get it out
there that actually insanely,

697
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:52,020
they had cracked down on cannabis.

698
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,870
And so people had moved to heroin
because sniffer dogs can't detect,

699
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:55,380
um,

700
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,880
heroin as easily as cannabis.

701
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,990
See,

702
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,980
calories was everywhere.

703
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,540
Sorry.

704
00:18:59,540 --> 00:18:59,850
Uh,

705
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,810
heroin is everywhere.

706
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,490
Loads of American troops were using it.

707
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,830
And if you look at what
people said at the time,

708
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,881
the authorities,

709
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:06,780
the Nixon White House,

710
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,910
they were shitting themselves
cause they're like,

711
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,680
they believe this chemical
hooks theory of addiction.

712
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:12,510
So they're like,

713
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,081
fuck,

714
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:14,070
when this Warren's,

715
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,151
we can have,

716
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:15,510
you know,

717
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,780
half a million heroin addicts on
the streets of the United States.

718
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,790
There's a really good
study that followed these,

719
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,653
these men home.

720
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,830
And it found that the vast
majority of them just stopped,

721
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,341
right?

722
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,290
They didn't go into and go to rehab.

723
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,720
Most of them that didn't go
into horrific withdrawal.

724
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:32,820
Some of them had an
uncomfortable flu like symptoms.

725
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:33,280
But,

726
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,630
um,

727
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,070
most of them just stop.

728
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:35,730
Now,

729
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,790
if you believe this old theory
that chemical hooks take you over,

730
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,590
that makes no sense.

731
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:42,840
But if you understand what
professor Alexander is saying,

732
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,770
all the new evidence about addiction
that I go through and chasing the scream,

733
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:48,900
it makes it makes perfect sense,

734
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:49,734
right?

735
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,611
You,

736
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:51,444
me,

737
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,040
everyone in this area.

738
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:58,070
If I took any of us and put
us in a horrific pestilential
jungle where we don't

739
00:19:58,381 --> 00:19:58,711
want to be,

740
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:01,530
and I made you kill a load of people
and potentially die at any moment,

741
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,430
you would find heroin much
more appealing than you do now,

742
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:05,910
right?

743
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,820
If we want to understand why
people turn to painkillers,

744
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:10,560
we've got to understand
why they're in pain,

745
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:11,350
right?

746
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,960
Um,

747
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,180
and,

748
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,450
and,

749
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,250
and the core of addiction,

750
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,001
it's made me,

751
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:17,160
I learned from these amazing
experts all over the world,

752
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,020
the core of addiction.

753
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,400
It's about not wanting to be present
in your life because your life is too

754
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:23,801
painful,

755
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:24,634
a place to be.

756
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,250
And once you understand that,

757
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,250
you can see why what we've
been doing is such a disaster,

758
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:29,820
right?

759
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,530
Cause the theory we have
with the war on drugs.

760
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,880
Think about Arizona.

761
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:33,691
We can talk about that more,

762
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,021
but I,

763
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:34,380
you know,

764
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,213
like I say,

765
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,630
I went to this nightmare
prison it Estrella prison in,

766
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:40,291
in Phoenix,

767
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,124
Arizona,

768
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,840
where people are humiliated.

769
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,160
And the theory behind that,

770
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,500
part of the theory behind the war on
drugs is if you've got people who are

771
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:48,250
addicted,

772
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,650
you got to inflict pain on them to,

773
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:50,891
you know,

774
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:52,480
give them an incentive to stop,

775
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:53,314
right?

776
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,310
But once you understand that pain is in
fact the fuel of addiction is in fact

777
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:59,080
the primary cause of addiction.

778
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,080
You can see why sometimes
people say that doesn't work.

779
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,640
Truth is much worse,

780
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:04,090
right?

781
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,530
That makes addiction worse.

782
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,110
Those women I went out with and
spent all that time with who are,

783
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,160
you know,

784
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,711
humiliate.

785
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:14,711
I remember in that prison we come back
from being on the chain gang where they

786
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:15,754
have to,

787
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,320
sometimes they have to dig graves.

788
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:18,460
They weren't doing that
the day I was there.

789
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:22,330
They had to collect garbage the day
I was one of the days I was there.

790
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:27,331
But we come back and normally
with prisons as a journalist,

791
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,140
they don't want to show you anything,

792
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,560
right?

793
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,041
You're like,

794
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,010
you have to kind of really finagle to
get them to show you anything in this

795
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:33,840
prison.

796
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,673
Um,

797
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,490
it's like a pantomime of cruelty.

798
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:37,330
They want to show it to you.

799
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,920
The whole point is to
humiliate these people,

800
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:39,640
right?

801
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,840
So the women I've been talking to him,

802
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,290
the men were really terrified of what
they called the whole right is the

803
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,220
solitary blog.

804
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,590
And so I said to the gods,

805
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,531
will you show me the whole,

806
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:49,151
I was sure they sent it.

807
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:49,331
They're like,

808
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:49,481
yeah,

809
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:49,691
sure.

810
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:49,970
Come on.

811
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,061
Show.

812
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:50,894
Yeah.

813
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,510
So go around to the whole,

814
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,860
and these women who benefit the
most like trivial infractions,

815
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:59,650
like having a cigarette
is literally a hole,

816
00:21:59,680 --> 00:21:59,951
right?

817
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,150
It's like a concrete block.

818
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:01,984
You're on your own.

819
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,831
There's nothing in it.

820
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:04,540
There's a tiny window
where you can see sunlight,

821
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,553
no TV,

822
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,393
nothing.

823
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,360
Um,

824
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,270
I remember speaking to a woman who
was in this and suddenly thinking,

825
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,410
this is the closest you could get to an
exact human recreation of the cages that

826
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,090
guaranteed addiction in rats.

827
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:19,924
Right?

828
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,370
And this is what we're doing,

829
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,070
thinking it will stop
these women being addicted.

830
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:26,740
It's the system we've built.

831
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:29,770
A doctor Gabble Martay and
amazing guy said to me,

832
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,490
you know,

833
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,350
if negative consequences
stopped addiction,

834
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,000
there won't be a single
addict in the world.

835
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,600
Right?

836
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,850
What have people with addiction
problems not suffered?

837
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,070
Humiliation have they not endured.

838
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,150
So we've got this,

839
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,480
we've got to really shift our
perspective on what addiction is.

840
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:45,820
And there are places that have done this
that have led to incredible results.

841
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,140
The,

842
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,420
uh,

843
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,110
I love that rat experiment one,

844
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:53,070
because that had always been parroted
as this is the proof positive that the,

845
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,320
these drugs are so terrible for you.

846
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:58,260
But once they figured out that if
you take those rats and put them in a

847
00:22:58,261 --> 00:23:00,390
wonderful place and they
don't have addiction,

848
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:02,010
it really does make you step back and go,

849
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,281
okay,

850
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,900
what is exactly going on here?

851
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,370
Obviously there's chemical hooks.

852
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:06,120
They are real,

853
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,110
like people that are on sustained
prolonged use of opiates,

854
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:10,801
especially,

855
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:10,980
uh,

856
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,190
people with back injuries have an
incredibly difficult time kicking them,

857
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,670
even really positive people who
don't necessarily have awful lives.

858
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:18,511
But,

859
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:18,870
um,

860
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,050
uh,

861
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,770
it's,

862
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,910
it's one of those things that gets in
your head and then you sort of paired it.

863
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:24,560
You,

864
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:24,870
you've,

865
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,560
you've heard it,

866
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,393
you repeat it.

867
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,700
But it's the reason why
I asked you the question.

868
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,181
It's like,

869
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:31,014
what?

870
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,860
What is,

871
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,100
what is the cause for most
people you believe it's,

872
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,500
uh,

873
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,500
an unfulfilled life or a painful life or
painful self image or remorse for your

874
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:44,731
past?

875
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:46,020
Or what is it that,

876
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,060
do we have like primary reasons or primary
attributes that we attached to these

877
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,410
people that are drug addicted?

878
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:54,741
Yeah,

879
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:56,540
so this was what my more recent book,

880
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,860
which is called lost connections,

881
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:00,620
uncovering the real causes of depression
in the unexpected solutions is,

882
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,521
is about,

883
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:05,720
cause I think the core of addiction is
it's about trying to deal with pain,

884
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,560
right?

885
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,730
But the causes of human pain,

886
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,140
obviously huge.

887
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,630
But what I learned is the scientific
evidence for nine causes of kind of deep

888
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:15,261
despair.

889
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:19,580
Right now if you think about
depression and very similar factors,

890
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:20,241
plot with addiction,

891
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,860
they're actually densely interconnected,

892
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,993
um,

893
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,490
phenomena.

894
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,180
But there are real biological factors,

895
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:26,331
right?

896
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,070
Your genes can make you
more vulnerable to that.

897
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:30,350
Just like some people find it
easier to put on weight than others.

898
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,070
And there are real brain changes that
happen when you become depressed or

899
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:34,790
addicted.

900
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,200
That can make it harder to get out,

901
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:36,800
right?

902
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,160
But at most of the factors
that are causing this,

903
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:44,540
despair are not factors in our biology
that factors in the way we live.

904
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,563
I think it's a kind of,

905
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,890
this doesn't cover all of the causes
that I learned about Veloce connections,

906
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:50,150
but it causes a lot of them.

907
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,120
Everyone watching your show knows
they have natural physical needs,

908
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:53,541
obviously,

909
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:54,290
right?

910
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,160
You need food,

911
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:55,911
you need water,

912
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,990
you need shelter,

913
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:57,980
you need cleaner.

914
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,820
Exactly.

915
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,930
If I took those things away from you,

916
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,100
you'd be fucked really quickly.

917
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:01,700
Right?

918
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,200
But there's equally strong evidence.

919
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,780
The all human beings have
natural psychological needs,

920
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,380
right?

921
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,640
You need to feel you belong.

922
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,220
You need to feel your life
has meaning and purpose.

923
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,800
You need to feel that people
see you and value you.

924
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,431
You need to be,

925
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:15,230
you've got a future that makes sense.

926
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,530
And this culture we've built is good at
lots of things and I'm really glad to be

927
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:19,880
alive today for all sorts of reasons.

928
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,020
Had to go to the dentist the other day.

929
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,390
I'm glad to be alive now and
not like a hundred years ago,

930
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,620
but there's a lot evidence that we'd been
getting less and less good at meeting

931
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,600
these deep underlying psychological needs.

932
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,430
Let's think about you
referred to the opioid crisis,

933
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:32,210
for example,

934
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,650
because I think even a lot of really good
people are profoundly misunderstanding

935
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:39,020
what's happening with the opioid crisis.

936
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,030
Where is the opioid crisis happening,

937
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:41,240
right?

938
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,140
Been to a lot of the epicenters a bit
places like Monadnock in New Hampshire.

939
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,483
Why is,

940
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,990
why are things so disastrous there?

941
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:49,310
Why is there much higher,

942
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:49,970
uh,

943
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,590
opioid addiction in West Virginia
than on the Faculty of Harvard?

944
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:55,040
Right?

945
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,650
People in the Faculty of Harvard
have much better access to opioids,

946
00:25:57,651 --> 00:25:57,860
right?

947
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,590
Everyone there has good health insurance.

948
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,300
They have much better access.

949
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:05,600
What's going on that
some amazing economists,

950
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,280
Angus Deaton and Ann Case,

951
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,610
did a massive study of this and they said
that we need to understand the opioid

952
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,430
deaths mainly as what they
call deaths of despair,

953
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,360
right?

954
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,630
It's not a coincidence that the places
were opioid addiction is highest,

955
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,770
are also the places where suicide
not with opioids is highest.

956
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,870
We're antidepressant
prescriptions or highest,

957
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,063
there's a whole,

958
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,500
these things are clustering
together for a reason,

959
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:28,250
right?

960
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,980
And you don't have to spend much time
in those places to see people through no

961
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:31,814
fault of their own.

962
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,340
Have I liked the rats in that first cage,

963
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:34,820
right?

964
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,980
They had been deprived of the
things that make life meaningful.

965
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,050
It doesn't mean chemical
hooks don't play some role.

966
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,070
They do play a role.

967
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,040
But I've been to the places that have
solved this and it wasn't by thinking

968
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,741
primarily about that.

969
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:45,530
So just talk about the reality.

970
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,131
Chemical Hooks it.

971
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:46,440
That's right.

972
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,050
Cause it's very important to
understand in relation to opioids.

973
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,680
This is a very strong agreement among
scientists that the most powerful chemical

974
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:54,300
hook we know is nicotine,

975
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:54,750
right?

976
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,650
You smoke cigarettes.

977
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:57,600
Like my mother smokes
seventies cigarettes a day.

978
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,680
He smoked cigarettes.

979
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,620
The thing you feel a physical
craving for when you stop,

980
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:02,670
which my mother would never do,

981
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,360
is,

982
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,960
um,

983
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,650
is nicotine.

984
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:04,920
Right?

985
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,030
That's the chemical hook.

986
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,623
Um,

987
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,690
and so in the late eighties,

988
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,790
when nicotine patches were invented,

989
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,090
there's this huge wave of
optimism among scientists get,

990
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:15,924
they're like,

991
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,050
oh,

992
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,830
right,

993
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,830
cigarette smoking is an addiction
to the chemical hook nicotine.

994
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,000
Now we can give people all the chemical
hook they're addicted to without any of

995
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:25,890
this shitty cancer causing smoke,

996
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,510
people are going to start smoking,

997
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,340
right?

998
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,800
Um,

999
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,630
so nicotine patches are introduced in
the US surgeon general's report a couple

1000
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:33,870
of days later,

1001
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,680
fines,

1002
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,670
highly motivated people
using nicotine patches.

1003
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,360
Um,

1004
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,150
17% of them will stop smoking,

1005
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,030
right?

1006
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,920
That's important to say.

1007
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:45,210
That is not nothing,

1008
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:45,900
right?

1009
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,660
That means if you meet the Chemical
Hook for people who are addicted to

1010
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:49,290
cigarettes,

1011
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,030
17% of them will stop entirely.

1012
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,440
That's a big deal,

1013
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,711
right?

1014
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:54,780
That's saved a huge
number of people's lives.

1015
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,970
But obviously 17% is not
100% that leaves 83%.

1016
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,980
The gotta be explained
by the other things.

1017
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,600
And that's really the factors
that I talked about in,

1018
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,740
in Los Connections.

1019
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:05,280
So,

1020
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,491
I mean,

1021
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:06,301
there's a whole range of them,

1022
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:06,511
but you know,

1023
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:07,800
if you are acutely lonely,

1024
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:09,990
we are the loneliest
society there's ever been,

1025
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,680
right?

1026
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,720
You are much more likely to
be vulnerable to despair,

1027
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:13,261
depression,

1028
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:14,040
addiction.

1029
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,380
If you are controlled
and humiliated at work,

1030
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:18,360
which most people now are to some degree,

1031
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,340
you're much more
vulnerable to these things.

1032
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,070
There's a whole range of
go through nine of these,

1033
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,160
these factors in the book.

1034
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:26,610
But to me the most important thing and
thinking about the opioid crisis and um,

1035
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,270
I find it really frustrating that this
is never discussed in the American debate

1036
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,220
is I've been to the place that solves
an opioid crisis that had a disastrous

1037
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:37,200
opioid crisis and ended it.

1038
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:37,740
Right?

1039
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,890
And they did something that's
very different to Americans
are being urged to do.

1040
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,280
So I'm a Swiss citizen
because my dad's from there.

1041
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:44,851
So I switched to them.

1042
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:45,684
Well,

1043
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,880
and by the time you get to the year 2000,

1044
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,880
Switzerland is having
like an opioid nightmare,

1045
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:51,490
right?

1046
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:51,870
Um,

1047
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,550
people can look up videos from the time,

1048
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:54,480
but you know,

1049
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:59,150
people like Swiss people are obsessed
with order is not coincidence.

1050
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,630
They invented clocks and all that shit,

1051
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:01,380
right?

1052
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,880
Like in their public parks,

1053
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:05,940
people like injecting in the
neck like nightmare scenes,

1054
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:06,540
right?

1055
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,410
That'd be bad anywhere.

1056
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:08,191
But to Swiss people,

1057
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:09,930
this is like the worst nightmare,

1058
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:10,764
right?

1059
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,390
And they try all sorts of things.

1060
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:13,470
They tried the American way,

1061
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:14,430
arresting people,

1062
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:15,211
punishing people,

1063
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,110
shaming people,

1064
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,570
and it just keeps getting worse and worse.

1065
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,040
And then one day they get this,

1066
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:24,970
this incredible woman called Ruth Dreifuss
who I got to know later who becomes a

1067
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,520
minister of health and then the president,

1068
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:28,320
the first ever female
president of Switzerland,

1069
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,583
um,

1070
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,440
she explains to people,

1071
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,010
I think the solution
is to legalize heroin.

1072
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,700
And she said,

1073
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,910
I know that sounds really shocking cause
when you hear the word legalization,

1074
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,680
what you picture is anarchy and chaos.

1075
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,790
She said,

1076
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,940
what we have now is anarchy and chaos,

1077
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,690
right?

1078
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,690
We have unknown criminals selling
unknown chemicals to unknown drug users.

1079
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,200
All in the dark,

1080
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,580
all filled with violence,

1081
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:56,710
disease and chaos legalization.

1082
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,620
She explained is the way we
restore order to this madness.

1083
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:00,100
Right?

1084
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,650
So the way it works isn't spent
lot of time in these places.

1085
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,150
And obviously no,

1086
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:06,310
or maybe there's some really
hardcore libertarians,

1087
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:09,970
but almost no one believes
we should legalize heroin
the way alcohol or cannabis

1088
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:10,271
illegal.

1089
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:10,451
Right?

1090
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:13,140
No one thinks there should
be a heroine island CBS.

1091
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,841
That's not the plan.

1092
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:14,340
Right.

1093
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,390
What did in Switzerland is
if you had a heroin problem,

1094
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,830
you were assigned to a clinic.

1095
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,250
I went,

1096
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,600
spent a lot time in the one in Geneva,

1097
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,460
the former president,

1098
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:23,080
Ruth dreifuss lives opposite this clinic.

1099
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:24,640
I think that tells you something.

1100
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,570
Um,

1101
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,620
like across the street,

1102
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,483
across the street,

1103
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,260
what,

1104
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,561
what it,

1105
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:29,440
what it does,

1106
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,290
it's the way it works
is she should move well,

1107
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,790
but if you see the clinic that day,

1108
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,030
why?

1109
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,600
Right?

1110
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,260
So the way it works is you have to go
to the clinic at seven o'clock in the

1111
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:41,230
morning because Swiss people believe
in doing things really fucking early.

1112
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:42,940
It's constant disagreement
between me and my dad.

1113
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,103
You turn up,

1114
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,153
you go in,

1115
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,420
they give you your hair in there,

1116
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:47,980
they give you medically pure heroin.

1117
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,790
You can't take it out with yet.

1118
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:50,531
You've got to use it there.

1119
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:52,060
Partly because I don't
want you to sell it on.

1120
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,010
But mainly because they want to monitor
you to make sure you know you don't

1121
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,113
overdose.

1122
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,973
Um,

1123
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:01,690
you use it there and then you leave to
go to your job because you're given a

1124
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:02,530
load to support,

1125
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:05,830
to get housing work and
therapy to the grout.

1126
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,220
Why you can't bear to
be present in your life.

1127
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:09,550
Right?

1128
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,170
So it's really important
they give two things.

1129
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:11,501
That's puts,

1130
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:13,480
bear in mind these two things because
the opposite of what we're doing at the

1131
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:14,314
moment here,

1132
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,970
give them the safest possible version
of the drug and give the massive amounts

1133
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:21,910
of help to deal with the
reasons why they need that drug.

1134
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,010
Now they're giving them a drug
or the injecting it in them.

1135
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,190
Yeah,

1136
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,850
they know they,

1137
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,860
the individual injects himself or herself.

1138
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,790
So if you,

1139
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,630
if you were the patient,

1140
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,493
I'm the nurse,

1141
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,840
I give you the heroin and
I give you a clean syringe.

1142
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,880
And one of the things
that really surprised me,

1143
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,950
I at first I found really weird is they
will give you any dose of heroin that

1144
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:40,540
you want apart from one
that would kill you.

1145
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,510
And there is never any
pressure to cut back.

1146
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,350
And yeah,

1147
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,370
I went there when it was 13 years after
this at first started and there was

1148
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:50,050
almost nobody on the program.

1149
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,860
Um,

1150
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,320
from the start there were like three
people who've been there the whole time.

1151
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,290
Almost everyone does cut
back and stop over time.

1152
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,850
And I remember saying to a Rita mango,

1153
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,100
who's the chief psychiatrist there,

1154
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:00,934
well,

1155
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,990
well how can that be?

1156
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,900
Cause we're told the
chemical hooks take you over.

1157
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:06,010
You need more and more.

1158
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,840
If you had an unlimited supply,

1159
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:09,190
you would just carry on forever.

1160
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:09,820
What?

1161
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,191
How can,

1162
00:32:10,191 --> 00:32:10,690
how can,

1163
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,860
how do you explain this?

1164
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,860
And she looked at me like
I was dumb and she said,

1165
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,270
well,

1166
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,980
we help them and their lives get better.

1167
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,690
And as your life gets better,

1168
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:21,580
you don't want to be anesthetized so much.

1169
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,600
Which ones that's explained
to you is so obvious.

1170
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,470
Right?

1171
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,880
But it's worth just explaining the results
of the Swiss program in the Phillies

1172
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:31,571
15 years now,

1173
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:33,130
in the 15 years since this began,

1174
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,970
according to the best scientific evidence
be like Professor Ambrose Oxton Haagen

1175
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:41,000
have shown that had been zero deaths,

1176
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,920
overdose deaths on legal heroin.

1177
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,450
Not One person.

1178
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,740
There's been a massive fall in overdose
deaths outside the legal program cause

1179
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:52,190
people transfer in because why would you
carry on using expensive shitty street

1180
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:53,300
drugs when you could be getting,

1181
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:53,870
you know,

1182
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,940
help and given the drug for free.

1183
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:56,840
Um,

1184
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,800
and once it is fascinating about this
is Swiss people are really conservative,

1185
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:00,981
right?

1186
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:03,590
My Swiss relatives make
Donald Trump look like Oprah.

1187
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,530
And yet Swiss people after
this had been in practice for,

1188
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,340
uh,

1189
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,180
five years,

1190
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,100
had a referendum on
whether to get rid of it.

1191
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,490
And 70% of Swiss people
voted to keep heroin legal.

1192
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,960
Not Cause they're so compassionate.

1193
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:15,471
To be honest.

1194
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:16,280
That's not,

1195
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,970
they're not,

1196
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,803
they're really not.

1197
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:18,190
Uh,

1198
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,850
it was cause crime fell so much.

1199
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,480
Right?

1200
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,550
It's much cheaper to give some crime fall.

1201
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,350
I've got the statistics in the book.

1202
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:25,220
It's fear since I wrote it,

1203
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:25,760
but there was,

1204
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,780
I think something like a 50% fall in
street street crime street prostitution

1205
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:30,680
literally ended,

1206
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,070
right?

1207
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,630
There was no street
prostitution after that.

1208
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,600
It turns out women don't want to be
on the street being fucked by random

1209
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:36,170
strangers.

1210
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,003
But the body,

1211
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,450
if they've got like an alternative,

1212
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,020
who knew?

1213
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,160
But the um,

1214
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,520
so it was an enormous fallen crime
across the board and the police confirmed

1215
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,730
that everyone agrees with
that in Switzerland and all
the kind of anarchy in the

1216
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:48,170
streets just just stopped.

1217
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:48,890
Right.

1218
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,131
But,

1219
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:52,640
but what the reason I think it is really
relevant to the opioid crisis is what

1220
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:54,710
we're doing is the exact opposite,

1221
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:55,310
right?

1222
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,160
So they give them the
safe version of the drug,

1223
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,360
give them help to figure out why practical
support to change their environment

1224
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,690
to get out of the isolet occasion more
into a life that's more like rat park.

1225
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:10,280
What do we do if your doctor in this
country finds out that you are using say

1226
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,720
Percocet or Oxy,

1227
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,430
not because you've got back pain,

1228
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:14,750
but because you've got an addiction,

1229
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,570
your doctor by law has to cut you off,

1230
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:17,811
right?

1231
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:18,261
They don't,

1232
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:19,370
they can be busted as a dealer.

1233
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,460
It's happened to lots of doctors
so they have to cut you off.

1234
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:23,540
So instead of giving you the drug,

1235
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:24,770
we stopped you getting the drug.

1236
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,663
Most people then,

1237
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,150
or not most of very large number then
transfer to much more dangerous street

1238
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:29,984
drugs like heroin.

1239
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,140
Secondly far from giving you
how to turn your life around.

1240
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,760
We give you a criminal record,

1241
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,140
we shame you,

1242
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,400
we stigmatize you.

1243
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,950
We put barriers between
you and reconnecting.

1244
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,690
The opposite of addiction is connection.

1245
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:42,620
But what do we do?

1246
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,140
We put barriers between
people and reconnecting.

1247
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,540
This is why that's one part of it,

1248
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:47,691
right?

1249
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:49,340
So there's the drug policy part of it,

1250
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,360
uh,

1251
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,660
where we are doing exactly the opposite
of the country that succeeded in ending

1252
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:54,650
it's opiod epidemic.

1253
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,581
But there's something,

1254
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:57,050
I think there's even deeper than that,

1255
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,330
which you really see in
places like West Virginia,

1256
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,560
Monadnock,

1257
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,830
the kind of hearts of the,

1258
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,310
the opioid crisis,

1259
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:09,311
which is we're also creating a society
that is becoming harder and harder for

1260
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:10,490
people to be present in,

1261
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,510
especially in those,

1262
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,870
in those places.

1263
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,590
There's an analogy I
keep thinking of in the,

1264
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:17,150
in the 18th century in Britain,

1265
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,030
loads of people were driven out of the
countryside into these disgusting urban

1266
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:25,430
slums in like a London and Manchester.

1267
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,783
And,

1268
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,010
and something happened that
that has been well documented.

1269
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:32,300
There was then called the gin craze,

1270
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,020
right?

1271
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,770
Where basically shitloads of people
just became alcoholics drank again until

1272
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:37,230
they,

1273
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,680
right.

1274
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,220
There's a famous

1275
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,850
painting from the time called Gin Lane
of a mother down in like a bottle of

1276
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:44,280
vodka while a baby like
falls out the window.

1277
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,060
Right.

1278
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,620
And things like that
really were happening.

1279
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,150
If you look at what
people said at the time,

1280
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,740
very similar to what they're saying now,

1281
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,490
they said,

1282
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,140
look at this evil drug gin.

1283
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,060
Look what it's fucking done to us.

1284
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,370
If only we could get rid
of this evil drug gin,

1285
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:57,390
there's problem will go away.

1286
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,373
Right.

1287
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,360
We know now when we look
back at the gin craze,

1288
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,840
it can have been Jenn that caused it
because anyone in Britain who's over the

1289
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:05,310
age of 18 can go and buy gin.

1290
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,120
Right.

1291
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,320
And while we still have some alcoholics
to be sure we don't have mass epidemics

1292
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:10,870
of alcoholism,

1293
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,390
you don't have babies
falling out of windows.

1294
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,390
What changed wasn't the
amount of availability,

1295
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:16,710
it wasn't the availability of the drug.

1296
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,990
The drug is more available
now than it was then.

1297
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,140
What changed was the amount of
pain and distress in the society,

1298
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:22,710
right?

1299
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,860
We don't have it started brought
as profoundly disorientated.

1300
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,470
I mean it's going up because
we're creating more orientation.

1301
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,490
So we,

1302
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,170
if you create a society where peoples
basic psychological needs are not met

1303
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:34,920
right,

1304
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,660
where they have shrinking
number of friends and social
connections where they're

1305
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:44,100
taught that life is about money and buying
shit and displaying it on Instagram,

1306
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,833
excuse me,

1307
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,630
where they spend most
of their time at jobs,

1308
00:36:48,631 --> 00:36:50,040
they find unfulfilling,

1309
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,570
controlling and humiliating.

1310
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,321
You can,

1311
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:52,381
uh,

1312
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:55,530
create growing pools of people who can't.

1313
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:55,831
And you,

1314
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:56,270
by the way,

1315
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,480
if you're constantly insecure,

1316
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,440
financially insecure,

1317
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,170
half of all Americans have
through no fault of their own,

1318
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:04,350
have been able to set aside $500
for if an emergency comes along,

1319
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,140
she cretins pervasive
insecurity in the society.

1320
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,520
You're going to create very large numbers
of people who are going to want to an

1321
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,250
fill Anita anesthetize themselves.

1322
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,233
Now,

1323
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,500
that's not a good solution.

1324
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,510
Obviously I don't think heroin opioids,

1325
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,910
these are not good
solutions to these problems,

1326
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:21,960
but,

1327
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,390
but it's not a crazy solution either.

1328
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,400
There's a line I think of all the time.

1329
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,540
I don't quite see it very often because
people can really react against this

1330
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,170
insight.

1331
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,190
I think it's actually important.

1332
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:32,521
You know,

1333
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:33,301
Marianne Faithfull,

1334
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,490
the great like sixties British singer,

1335
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,710
she went out with Mick Jagger and
normally that's why people remember.

1336
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:38,730
She's much better than Mick Jagger.

1337
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,773
Um,

1338
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,763
in her memoir,

1339
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,100
she shot heroin addiction in the 60.

1340
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:43,230
She was homeless for awhile.

1341
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,470
She has this very challenging line,

1342
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,141
I think about a lot,

1343
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,250
I'm going to phrase it slightly wrong,

1344
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:49,020
but she said,

1345
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:49,680
um,

1346
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,740
heroin saved my life because
if it wasn't for heroin,

1347
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:54,090
I would have killed myself at that point.

1348
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,343
Right?

1349
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,460
Now Marianne Faithfull,

1350
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:59,370
if not saying heroin was a
good solution to homelessness,

1351
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,260
but we've got to understand this drug
use is happening because it performs a

1352
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:05,094
function,

1353
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,580
right?

1354
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,480
One of the most important things,

1355
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:07,350
I don't know for both of my books,

1356
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,910
for chasing the scream
and lost connection,

1357
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,910
is that these forms of despair,

1358
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,750
depression,

1359
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,411
anxiety,

1360
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:14,220
addiction,

1361
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,810
they are meaningful signals,

1362
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:16,320
right?

1363
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,730
They are telling us something.

1364
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,400
The fact that there had been
rising year after year after year,

1365
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,150
that we're now at the point where average
white male life expectancy has fallen

1366
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:28,080
in this country for the first time in
the entire piece time history of the

1367
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:28,914
United States.

1368
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,160
That is a signal that is telling us
something and that's because of drug

1369
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:35,070
addiction and overwhelming cause
of drug addiction and suicide.

1370
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,270
It's,

1371
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,220
it's risen to that point.

1372
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,290
Are there other factors
going on like obesity,

1373
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,670
but that the main drivers are,

1374
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,563
um,

1375
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:40,960
oh,

1376
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,010
overdose and suicide and that he's telling
us something of what we've been doing

1377
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:47,740
up to now is we've been
insulting that signal.

1378
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,840
We've either been saying depressed people,

1379
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,310
addicted people are just weak.

1380
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,570
Or we've been saying,

1381
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:52,811
oh,

1382
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:56,140
it's just a problem in their brain that
there are real things going on in their

1383
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:56,411
brains,

1384
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:57,244
of course.

1385
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,030
Um,

1386
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,841
or we've been saying,

1387
00:38:58,841 --> 00:38:59,051
you know,

1388
00:38:59,051 --> 00:39:00,430
it's just craziness.

1389
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,300
Um,

1390
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,040
but in fact,

1391
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,670
it is largely a response
to the way we're living.

1392
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,011
Of course,

1393
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:06,970
there are other things going on as well,

1394
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:07,930
and we can talk about them.

1395
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,930
And once you understand that,

1396
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,000
you realize there's got
to be a deeper response.

1397
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:14,140
And I went to places that had done it,

1398
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:14,974
not just Switzerland,

1399
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,350
Switzerland.

1400
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,450
What is the lower the overall population?

1401
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,860
Five and a half million.

1402
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,990
So it's a small
comparatively small country.

1403
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,430
Yeah.

1404
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:23,860
Um,

1405
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,550
how much money do they have to
spend to keep this program going?

1406
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:28,081
And what are the,

1407
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:30,590
what is it a time constraint in
terms of like how long has a,

1408
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:33,610
a person who's got an addiction
problem allowed to stay there and,

1409
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,260
and receive treatment?

1410
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,730
There's no time constraint.

1411
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:38,830
You can stay on for your
entire life if you want to.

1412
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:40,240
In practice that doesn't happen very,

1413
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:41,800
they stay in the facility?

1414
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:41,951
No,

1415
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:42,130
no.

1416
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,210
They live in apartments.

1417
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,670
They just visit.

1418
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,780
They just go every day
or whenever they want to.

1419
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:46,961
I mean,

1420
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:48,610
I think you can go twice
a day and it's free.

1421
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,331
It's free.

1422
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:50,200
It doesn't cost anything.

1423
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,460
I mean some people,

1424
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:52,271
once they have jobs,

1425
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:54,520
then pay health insurance and
health insurance pays for it.

1426
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,230
But if you don't have
money then they pay for it.

1427
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,020
And,

1428
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,810
and one thing that was
fascinating is they found it.

1429
00:39:58,811 --> 00:39:59,450
It wasn't,

1430
00:39:59,450 --> 00:39:59,950
um,

1431
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,120
Joanne set,

1432
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:01,540
uh,

1433
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,510
did good research on or science
good research on this for,

1434
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,251
she did research.

1435
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:06,460
The Open Society Foundation.

1436
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,730
It's actually cheaper than the
police constantly harassing people,

1437
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,570
putting them in prison,

1438
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,740
putting them on trial.

1439
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:16,480
Those are really expensive things to do.

1440
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,620
Heroin is unbelievably cheap.

1441
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:18,431
If you buy it legally,

1442
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:18,950
right?

1443
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,640
They did the amount of money they
would save just in street crime being

1444
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:22,720
radically reduced.

1445
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,680
Exactly.

1446
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,513
It makes,

1447
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,290
it makes the life of the
person with addiction better.

1448
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,000
It makes the lives of ordinary of other
citizens who are not addicted better.

1449
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,870
Um,

1450
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,980
and it saves money.

1451
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,640
Right.

1452
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,620
Which is why stress people
who are very pragmatic,

1453
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,150
they're not,

1454
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,370
you know,

1455
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,450
the most compassionate people,

1456
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,430
but they are very pragmatic people.

1457
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,950
That's why it was so popular system.

1458
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,310
Let's think about another place that
adopted really different drug policies.

1459
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,090
Right?

1460
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:46,450
Um,

1461
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,550
cause I think it's something we
can learn from there as well.

1462
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,750
So Portugal,

1463
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,200
around the time Switzerland's
having it's horrific heroin crisis,

1464
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,270
Portugal is having a fucking nightmare,

1465
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:55,750
right?

1466
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,110
By the year 2001% of the
population was addicted to heroin,

1467
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:00,340
which is incredible,

1468
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,120
right?

1469
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,320
And every year they were like Switzerland.

1470
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,590
They were trying the American way,

1471
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:05,981
shame,

1472
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:06,551
punishment,

1473
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:09,460
stigma and things just kept
getting worse and worse and worse.

1474
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,640
And then one day the prime minister
and the leader of the opposition got

1475
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:13,331
together and the lawyer,

1476
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:14,350
we can't go on like this.

1477
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:14,920
What are we going to,

1478
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,790
what are we going to do?

1479
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,790
And they decided to do
something really radical,

1480
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,940
something no one had done since the
drug war began in this country 70 years

1481
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:22,774
before.

1482
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,973
They said,

1483
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,370
should we like ask them scientists
what the best thing to do would be?

1484
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,850
So they set up a panel of scientists
and doctors led by an amazing man.

1485
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:31,720
I got to know in Portugal,

1486
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,640
Dr Wow.

1487
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,970
Killough it totally extraordinary person.

1488
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:35,950
Um,

1489
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,470
and uh,

1490
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,150
he'd run the first of a drug
treatment center in Portugal,

1491
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,930
founded after the dictatorship
and they said to them,

1492
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,310
you guys just go away,

1493
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,970
look all the evidence and figure
out what the hell we can do.

1494
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,590
So they go away for two years.

1495
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:48,800
They,

1496
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,240
they learn about rat park,

1497
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,240
they learn loads of things and
they come back and they say,

1498
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:54,074
okay,

1499
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:59,360
solution is we want to decriminalize
all drugs from cannabis to crack.

1500
00:41:59,390 --> 00:41:59,870
But,

1501
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,070
and this is the crucial next step.

1502
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,890
Take all the money we currently
spend all fucking people up,

1503
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:04,791
arresting them,

1504
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:05,480
shaming them,

1505
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,350
and presenting them and spend all that
money instead on turning their lives

1506
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:10,184
around.

1507
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,121
And interestingly,

1508
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:14,090
it's not really what we think of as drug
treatment here in the United States,

1509
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:14,690
right?

1510
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,570
So they do some residential
rehab that has some value.

1511
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,680
Main thing they did was a big program of
job creation for people with addiction

1512
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:23,720
problems saying you used to be a mechanic,

1513
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,400
they go to a garage and they said,

1514
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:26,900
if you employ this guy for a year,

1515
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,690
we'll pay half his wages again,

1516
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:31,160
much cheaper than sending him to prison.

1517
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,790
Right.

1518
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:31,941
Uh,

1519
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,830
they set up a big program of small loans.

1520
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,590
So people with addiction problems
could set up and run businesses.

1521
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:38,480
The things that they thought
were important at the time.

1522
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:39,680
People like this is crazy.

1523
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:41,090
They're just gonna spend it all on drugs.

1524
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:41,661
Lunacy.

1525
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:42,250
Right?

1526
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,970
And by the time I went to Portugal,

1527
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:46,340
it was again a 13 years
since this has gone.

1528
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:47,210
And the results were him.

1529
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,580
Addiction was down by 50%.

1530
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,640
This is by far the biggest from
the British journal of Criminology.

1531
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:54,080
The best scientific study of this.

1532
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:54,890
Um,

1533
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,870
overdose deaths were massively down.

1534
00:42:56,871 --> 00:42:58,400
HIV was massively down.

1535
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,650
Every single indicator on problems related
to drug use had fallen like a cliff.

1536
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,250
Right?

1537
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:04,931
It wasn't perfect.

1538
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:06,200
They still got problems of course,

1539
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,000
but there was a massive improvement.

1540
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:11,060
And one of the reasons you know it works
so well is that virtually no one in

1541
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:11,960
Portugal wants to go back.

1542
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,830
I went and interviewed a great
guy called [inaudible] Guerra,

1543
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,640
who at the time of the decriminalization
was the top drug cop in the whole

1544
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,474
country.

1545
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,520
And he said,

1546
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,490
what I'm sure those of your listeners
are thinking right at the time,

1547
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:26,324
which was like,

1548
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,010
if we decriminalize all drugs,

1549
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:29,480
we can have an explosion in drug use.

1550
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,231
We can have lots of kids.

1551
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:31,160
He's interesting nightmare.

1552
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:32,090
We can't do this.

1553
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,830
And when I went to see him,

1554
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,250
uh,

1555
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,810
the audios on the Chasen screen website,

1556
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:39,290
he said a saying like
everything I said would happen,

1557
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:40,124
didn't happen,

1558
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,140
and everything the other
side said would happen,

1559
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:42,974
did.

1560
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,520
And he talks about how he felt really
ashamed that it's been so many years prior

1561
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:49,700
to the decriminalization screwing
people's lives up when it could have been

1562
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:51,200
helping them turn their lives around.

1563
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:51,920
And,

1564
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,530
and this is something that
I saw all over the world,

1565
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:55,100
right?

1566
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,360
The places that have drug policies based
on shame and stigma and the fantasy

1567
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:00,650
that you can get rid of drug use,

1568
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,940
which you can never do.

1569
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,343
Um,

1570
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,290
they have mass really
terrible and rising problems.

1571
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,060
The places that have policies based on,

1572
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:08,211
okay,

1573
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:13,211
let's restore order to the market and
let's give love liberty to drug users and

1574
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:16,340
love and compassion and practical
help for people with addiction.

1575
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:18,980
Problems have declining drug problems,

1576
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:19,430
right?

1577
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,791
Again,

1578
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:20,720
not perfect,

1579
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,960
but it was such a significant
improvement that support in Portugal.

1580
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,471
I mean,

1581
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:27,350
they've got five main political parties
and none of them want to go back,

1582
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:27,561
right?

1583
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:30,380
That tells you something right now.

1584
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,270
When they did this in Switzerland,

1585
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,950
what was the primary cause for this drug
addiction and how did they deal with

1586
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:38,191
that?

1587
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:41,170
So if they dealt with it in
Portugal with these loans and,

1588
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:41,431
and,

1589
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:41,791
and,

1590
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:45,630
and helping our businesses by paying
for half the salary and all those things

1591
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:47,790
like that seemed like wonderful ideas.

1592
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,850
What do they do in Switzerland to
sort of mitigate what are the issues,

1593
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,700
whatever the issues were that were
causing people to be drug addicts in the

1594
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:54,181
first place.

1595
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:55,020
So it's a combination.

1596
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:56,190
They gave people lots of therapy.

1597
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,250
So I remember one of the people I spent
some time within that clinic had been,

1598
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,390
um,

1599
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:01,950
terribly sexually abused.

1600
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,750
There's a lot of evidence that giving
survivors of sexual abuse safe places in

1601
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:09,600
which they can release their shame about
that leads to a big fall in depression,

1602
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:10,680
addiction and other problems.

1603
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,591
There's a lot of evidence that,

1604
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:11,761
that,

1605
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:13,300
that kind of abuse is,

1606
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,410
is a big driver of a lot of addiction
for a lot of people that clearly not

1607
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:17,244
everyone.

1608
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,323
Um,

1609
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,350
some of it was just,

1610
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:22,950
there were people who had never been
given a chance in life or I hadn't never

1611
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:24,060
had stable lives.

1612
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:24,620
Uh,

1613
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,160
it was kind of a mixture of things.

1614
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,670
And one of the things that's really good
about this three system is it wasn't

1615
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:31,890
saying in this kind of cookie cutter way,

1616
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:34,400
the up and half often happens in drug
treatment in the United States are there,

1617
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:35,910
there's plenty of good examples as well.

1618
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:36,990
You know,

1619
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,190
you don't arrive and they say,

1620
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,510
this is your problem.

1621
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:42,480
We're here to tell you your problem
and how to solve your problem.

1622
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,930
It's very much guided by
actually the person themselves,

1623
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:46,410
right?

1624
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,700
People who are in deep pain.

1625
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,510
The,

1626
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:48,780
the,

1627
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,610
the core of it is you
have to listen to them,

1628
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:50,701
right?

1629
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,200
If we think about this addiction,

1630
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:55,050
depression in the way that I'm arguing
that we should see them as signals that

1631
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:56,130
are telling us something.

1632
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,230
Most important thing is
to listen to the signal,

1633
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,093
right?

1634
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,820
I remember saying,

1635
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:04,140
I thought about a lot this
weird experience that I
kept thinking about all the

1636
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:04,380
time.

1637
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:04,981
I was writing my book,

1638
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:08,640
lost connections about depression and
started quite late and late in the day

1639
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,740
that I realized why I kept
thinking about it so much.

1640
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:14,520
I was in Vietnam about five years ago now,

1641
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,354
maybe a little bit less.

1642
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,673
Um,

1643
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,060
and I did this really stupid thing.

1644
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:18,750
I was,

1645
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,580
I was in Hanoi and I was really tired.

1646
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:22,650
I was doing research for different
book that I haven't finished yet.

1647
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,930
And uh,

1648
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:29,710
by the side of the road I saw this big
red apple women selling it and I'm sure

1649
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,101
haggling.

1650
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:32,190
And so I paid like $5 for
this apple or something and I,

1651
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,480
and I took it back to my hotel.

1652
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,411
I was so tired.

1653
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:37,740
I lay on the bed and I start
eating it and it was just gross.

1654
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:37,951
Right?

1655
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:38,784
There was some really,

1656
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,200
it's chemical taste.

1657
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:44,070
It was like how I imagined a food would
taste after a nuclear war when I used to

1658
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:45,150
watch these films in the 80s.

1659
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:45,810
Right.

1660
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,370
Um,

1661
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,610
but I was so tired,

1662
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,540
even though I knew it was wrong,

1663
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:53,541
I ate like half of it and threw it in
the garbage and the next like four days I

1664
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:56,370
was just like violently sick right there.

1665
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:59,170
Like just in like something
from the exit strategy.

1666
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,270
So I'm lying there in front of CNN and
occasionally projectile vomiting and it

1667
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:05,400
gets like I'd had food poisoning before.

1668
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:08,640
I basically lived on fried chicken in
my twenties I was not new to this Rodeo

1669
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,280
and after about four days,

1670
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,930
I said to Hawaiian,

1671
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:14,820
my fixer and translator who was a ranger,

1672
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:16,290
I was there to interview
survivors of the war,

1673
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,610
the Vietnam War for something.

1674
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:18,901
I'm like,

1675
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:19,440
look,

1676
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,420
I'm only here for another
three days or whatever it was.

1677
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,380
I've got to go and meet these people.

1678
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,090
Otherwise this whole trip would
have been a waste of time.

1679
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,260
So he drives me like six or seven hours
into the countryside and we get there

1680
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:29,960
and he's lined up these people
for me to interview and I'm like,

1681
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:30,271
I don't think,

1682
00:47:30,271 --> 00:47:30,460
oh,

1683
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,180
I don't feel so bad.

1684
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:31,990
Actually,

1685
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,040
I was sitting in this hot word,

1686
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:33,341
this,

1687
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:36,970
this woman who was an 86 year old woman
who was the only person from her village

1688
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:38,140
that survived the Vietnam War.

1689
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,210
So I'm talking to her and actually
speaking that the room starts to,

1690
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:45,580
I've never had this feeling before and
I've had a thing when you were drunk,

1691
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:46,181
when you fill the rooms,

1692
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:46,750
move it,

1693
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,790
it literally felt like the
room was moving around me.

1694
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:49,120
Like,

1695
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,890
like I didn't feel like
I was disorientated.

1696
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,540
And then while she's talking,

1697
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:57,070
I just like explode all over
her heart from both ads,

1698
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:58,360
like fucking horror show.

1699
00:47:58,361 --> 00:47:59,194
Right?

1700
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:00,510
And so I say to her,

1701
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,510
I'm just,

1702
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,740
just take me back,

1703
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,700
put me in the car,

1704
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,050
take me back to Hanoi.

1705
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,123
Right?

1706
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,670
And he's this old woman's like
saying sang to him and I'm just like,

1707
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,533
line there.

1708
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,593
And he says,

1709
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,141
she says,

1710
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:12,010
you've got to go to the hospital.

1711
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:12,521
You were really sick.

1712
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:12,791
And I'm like,

1713
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:13,031
no,

1714
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:13,330
no,

1715
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,380
I just need to go back to the I talk.

1716
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,070
And he said,

1717
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:15,230
yeah,

1718
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,550
and this is the only woman who survived
the Vietnam War in this village.

1719
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,160
I'm going to listen to her
health advice over yours.

1720
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:22,090
We're going to the hospital.

1721
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:23,370
So we go to this hospital were,

1722
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,520
I'm pretty sure I was
there in the European,

1723
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:25,121
it had been treated.

1724
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:27,090
They take me in and crimes
like completely lying,

1725
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,210
going like this is an important WESCO.

1726
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,270
It will disgrace Vietnam if he dies there.

1727
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:32,104
Right?

1728
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,910
And so I'm lying there and they're like
jabbing me with everything and I'm like,

1729
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,753
what's going on?

1730
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,910
And they're asking me lots of questions
and I felt the most nauseas I've ever

1731
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:43,451
felt right.

1732
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:44,650
And I kept saying to them,

1733
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,540
give me something for the nausea,

1734
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:47,001
three Hawaiian,

1735
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:48,040
because they didn't speak in English.

1736
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,170
And the doctor said to me,

1737
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,480
you need your nausea.

1738
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,730
It will tell us what's
wrong with you right now.

1739
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,730
Even lying there and thinking,

1740
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,650
it was kind of interesting.

1741
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,320
I was where we think of line there and
thinking they figured out what the apple,

1742
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,410
and I'm having such a ridiculous
thought where I thought,

1743
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,030
I come about to die,

1744
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:04,331
right?

1745
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:05,800
I've been killed by an apple.

1746
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:06,790
I'm like,

1747
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,310
eve or like snow white
or like Alan Turing.

1748
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:10,144
And then I was like,

1749
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,810
you're about to die in your last thought
is that you're basically a pretentious

1750
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,310
con.

1751
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,910
I was like horrified by myself.

1752
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:16,840
Anyway,

1753
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,690
they gave me this treatment and a few
days later when I leave and I'm talking to

1754
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:20,524
the doctor and I

1755
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,030
was discussing various things
with him and I said to him,

1756
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:25,950
what would have happened if I'd,

1757
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,793
um,

1758
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:27,910
if I had gone back to Hannah,

1759
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:29,110
if it drove me back to Hanoi and he said,

1760
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:29,560
Oh,

1761
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,900
well what happened is my kidneys has
stopped working because I hadn't kept any

1762
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:33,100
water in for four days.

1763
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,520
So it was like I had been in the desert
for four days and the doctor said,

1764
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:37,560
all you would have died
on the journey you went,

1765
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:38,394
it made it.

1766
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,960
And so can thinking about this experience,

1767
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:42,610
which weirdly it didn't
actually affect my like,

1768
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:43,411
well viewer and a thing.

1769
00:49:43,411 --> 00:49:45,580
It's the closest I've ever had
to a near death experience.

1770
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,691
But all three,

1771
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:47,920
researching my book about depression,

1772
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:48,460
loss connections,

1773
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,900
I kept thinking about this thing,

1774
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:50,081
right?

1775
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:51,130
You need your nausea,

1776
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:52,510
it will tell us what's wrong with you.

1777
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:57,600
And I realized all the time
I had been depressed for,

1778
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:00,790
I think about my relatives and people
I love who'd had addiction problems.

1779
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,360
I had seen that my depression,

1780
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,460
their addiction as a bit like that.

1781
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,000
Nausea,

1782
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,301
right?

1783
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:08,770
As like a kind of malfunction,

1784
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:09,100
right?

1785
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:14,100
Saying that you should get rid of and
actually what we need to do is hear it

1786
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:14,470
right?

1787
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,060
Because it will tell us
what's wrong with us.

1788
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:16,450
Right?

1789
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,440
It doesn't mean it's a good feeling.

1790
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:18,430
It's awful.

1791
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:18,641
Right?

1792
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,690
Depression is worse than I've ever felt
a addiction's a terrible state to being.

1793
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,410
It's not saying just in some kind of,

1794
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:23,840
you know,

1795
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:23,981
oh,

1796
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:25,090
we need to put up with it.

1797
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,280
It's that if we hear the signal,

1798
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,700
we can begin to find solutions
and all the places I went,

1799
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,000
the places that have solved depression,

1800
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:32,900
crises that I went to,

1801
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:33,734
floss connections,

1802
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,360
places that have solved addiction crises,

1803
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,110
that w that I went to for chasing
the screen are places that have said,

1804
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,550
actually this means something.

1805
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:41,090
Right?

1806
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,650
Your pain makes sense.

1807
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,890
You feel these ways for reasons
and we need to get down into these,

1808
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,020
these deeper reasons,

1809
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,500
which is really not what we've done in
the United States is the drug war began,

1810
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,630
you know,

1811
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,810
a century ago.

1812
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,260
So did they figure out in Switzerland
what was causing this rash of addiction?

1813
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,090
And just by treating it seems like if
there is some underlying condition that's

1814
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:04,520
causing this depression that's
leading people to drug addiction,

1815
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,930
that just giving them free heroin
is not going to fix the root cause.

1816
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,470
So how did they find out what the
root cause was and why it was such an

1817
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:13,040
epidemic?

1818
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,740
You're totally right that so the hero,

1819
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,600
the heroine is does two things.

1820
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:20,210
So partly as you become addicted,

1821
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,650
you spiraling the people who
don't have huge private resources.

1822
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:25,221
Some people do,

1823
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:26,054
right?

1824
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,021
As you become addicted,

1825
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:31,100
what happens to a lot of people is
you spiral into chaotic street use,

1826
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:31,730
right?

1827
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:32,870
So for a lot of women,

1828
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:34,220
that means sex work.

1829
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:34,941
For a lot of men,

1830
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:36,180
that means property crime.

1831
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,430
Some insects work as well,

1832
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:38,330
but mostly not.

1833
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,300
And so what happens is actually you,

1834
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:42,140
you become,

1835
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:42,381
you know,

1836
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:43,310
you develop an addiction to,

1837
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,720
cause you're dealing with this pain,

1838
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,140
but then you actually move into
a much more chaotic way living,

1839
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:48,790
right?

1840
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:49,150
Which,

1841
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,930
which causes deeper pain and deeper paid.

1842
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:54,020
Obviously if you're being fucked by
strangers every day and you're treating me

1843
00:51:54,021 --> 00:51:54,854
badly,

1844
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,080
you're going to want to be even
more anesthetized after that.

1845
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:57,770
Right.

1846
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,840
Or if you're frightened that
the police all the time.

1847
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:04,010
So what happens is partly what happened
in Switzerland was giving people the

1848
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:07,340
legal heroin ended the
chaos of street use,

1849
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,470
which in itself was
making addiction worse.

1850
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,200
That's clearly not the cause cause
you don't start out with the street.

1851
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,280
So it was partly that I think it was
partly attending to people's deeper

1852
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:22,190
distress and it's not like there's
one cookie cutter thing that was,

1853
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,300
that was the answer.

1854
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,890
It was listening to different people
at different stages and looking at,

1855
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:29,300
they'd had some problems
with unemployment,

1856
00:52:29,301 --> 00:52:32,690
but you don't want to
overstate that they'd have
some problems with child abuse.

1857
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,560
You don't want to overstate that.

1858
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,960
It was more like a kind of menu of things.

1859
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:38,420
And most sophisticated
menu of things that,

1860
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,320
but,

1861
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,960
but the thing that they definitely showed
in the Swiss model and in Portugal and

1862
00:52:42,961 --> 00:52:47,090
in lots of other places I went
to is compassionate treatment,

1863
00:52:47,091 --> 00:52:48,050
reduces addiction,

1864
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:48,680
right?

1865
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,700
And treatment understood in the broadest
sense because it reduces the pain.

1866
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:55,490
The individual is in anything
that reduces the shame.

1867
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,810
Stigma and humiliation will over time
reduce addiction for most people,

1868
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,800
not everyone.

1869
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,600
Some people are in such internal agony,

1870
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,310
they will always need anesthetics.

1871
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,940
And this I think is a really important
point and one that can be quite

1872
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:08,960
challenging to some people that can,

1873
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:11,840
people like me who have people
they love with addiction problems.

1874
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,650
So where are open chasing the scream is
with this story that I think a lot of

1875
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:16,280
people,

1876
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,113
um,

1877
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:20,360
think what the fuck is a book about
the war on drugs starting like this.

1878
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:21,950
And I think it tells you so much.

1879
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:22,850
Um,

1880
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:25,100
so in 1939 in a hotel,

1881
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,160
midtown Manhattan,

1882
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,211
Billie holiday,

1883
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:29,730
the great jazz singer walked on stage.

1884
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:33,810
She sang for the first time a song that
I'm sure all your listeners and viewers

1885
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,790
have heard a song called strange fruit,

1886
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,980
writes a song against lynching.

1887
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,000
It's the idea that,

1888
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,151
uh,

1889
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:39,871
in the south,

1890
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:42,600
the bodies of African American men hang
from the trees and they're like a kind

1891
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:44,430
of strange fruit in the south,

1892
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:45,060
right?

1893
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,950
This is unbelievably challenging.

1894
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:47,580
At that time,

1895
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,460
there are very few
popular songs like that.

1896
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,420
Um,

1897
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:51,780
and,

1898
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,900
and to have an African American
woman doing it was quite shocking,

1899
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:55,021
right?

1900
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:57,600
She wasn't even allowed to walk
through the front door of the hotel.

1901
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:00,660
They made her go through the service
elevator because she was African American.

1902
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,030
And that night Billy holiday gets a
warning from a man called Harry Anslinger

1903
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:09,450
from the agents of a man called
Harry Anslinger that basically says,

1904
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:11,550
stop singing this song and you think,

1905
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:11,930
wait,

1906
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,320
what's this got to do
with the war on drugs?

1907
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,600
So Harry Anslinger is a man.

1908
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:15,880
Uh,

1909
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,920
it was government bureaucrat,

1910
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,440
I think the most influential
person no one's ever heard of.

1911
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,810
He's affected the lives of the loads
of people listening to your show.

1912
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,650
So Harry Anslinger is a
government bureaucrat who
takes over the Department of

1913
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:28,890
prohibition just as alcohol
prohibition is ending.

1914
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:29,460
See,

1915
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,320
you've had this big war on alcohol.

1916
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,370
It's been a shit show.

1917
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:33,450
It's been a disaster.

1918
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,590
And he takes it over and he wants to
keep his government department going.

1919
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,380
And he invents the modern war on drugs,

1920
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:43,050
is the first person to ever
use the phrase war on drugs.

1921
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:43,980
And,

1922
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,600
and he really builds this war on drugs
around two intense hatred he has.

1923
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:49,380
And Billie holiday's,

1924
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,120
the personification of both.

1925
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,890
One was a really intense
hatred of African Americans.

1926
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:56,460
I mean,

1927
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,520
he was regarded as a
crazy racist in the 1920s,

1928
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:01,110
which gives you a sense
of how racist he was.

1929
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,170
He used the n word so
often in official memos.

1930
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,360
His own senator said is,

1931
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:06,091
you'd have to resign.

1932
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:07,050
That's how hardcore he was.

1933
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:07,884
Right.

1934
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,870
And you also had an intense hatred of
people with addiction problems and Billie

1935
00:55:12,871 --> 00:55:13,704
holiday.

1936
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:15,470
And she'd grown up on
the streets of Baltimore,

1937
00:55:15,471 --> 00:55:17,040
a part of Baltimore called pig town.

1938
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:17,940
She,

1939
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,751
when she was 10,

1940
00:55:18,751 --> 00:55:19,890
she was horrific.

1941
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:20,724
She was raped.

1942
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,160
Uh,

1943
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,490
the man who raped her was sent
to prison for a year and a half.

1944
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:26,880
She was sent a reformatory
for longer than he got right.

1945
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:27,631
She,

1946
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:29,730
she was tormented by the nuns there.

1947
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:30,120
They,

1948
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,290
they said he was disobedient.

1949
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,610
She brought it on herself.

1950
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,760
They used to lock her in a dead bodies
overnight to teach her a lesson.

1951
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:36,960
She eventually ran away.

1952
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:38,160
She tried to find her mother.

1953
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,160
Her mother had gone to what's now
called about Roosevelt island.

1954
00:55:41,161 --> 00:55:44,910
Now it wasn't called that then when
she was working as a prostitute.

1955
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,780
And Billie holiday starts kind of working
in inverted commas next to her mother

1956
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:50,490
in this brotha from when she's like 14.

1957
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:53,640
So she's being raped by men for
money night after night after night.

1958
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:53,911
She's,

1959
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:54,480
you know,

1960
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,110
and when they,

1961
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:55,890
the police rescue,

1962
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,360
rescue break into the brothel,

1963
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:59,070
they arrest her right
instead of to prison.

1964
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:00,703
Um,

1965
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:05,830
so Billie holiday's trying to numb the
grief and pain that comes from that.

1966
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:06,510
Right?

1967
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:10,350
So she starts out using loads of alcohol
and then she's using loads of other

1968
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:11,184
stuff as well,

1969
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,120
mostly heroin.

1970
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:18,080
And when she gets this warning
from Harry Anslinger saying,

1971
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:19,440
stop singing this song,

1972
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,780
Billie holiday's attitude is fuck you.

1973
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,830
I'm an American citizen.

1974
00:56:22,831 --> 00:56:23,110
I was,

1975
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:23,261
what?

1976
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:24,130
I fucking please.

1977
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,023
Right.

1978
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,230
And at that point,

1979
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,390
Harry Anslinger resolves to destroy her.

1980
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:33,870
The first man he sent to to track her
is a man called follow her round is guy

1981
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:34,894
called Jimmy Fletcher.

1982
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,690
Harry Anslinger hated
employing a white people,

1983
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,201
sorry,

1984
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:39,550
hate to employ African Americans,

1985
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,470
but you couldn't really send
a white person into Harlem
to follow Billie holiday

1986
00:56:42,471 --> 00:56:43,360
where it be kind of obvious.

1987
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:44,081
Say employed.

1988
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:45,700
This African American guy
called Jimmy Fletcher,

1989
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,120
he just quit.

1990
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,530
His job title was a bag man.

1991
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:48,430
So he was given the job,

1992
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:49,091
follow Billie holiday.

1993
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:49,960
Everywhere she goes,

1994
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,430
befriend her document,

1995
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:52,240
her druggies,

1996
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,073
right?

1997
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,940
He dances with her in nightclubs.

1998
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:56,380
He gets to know her really well.

1999
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,180
And Billie holiday was so amazing that
Jimmy Fletcher fell in love with her and

2000
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:03,370
his whole life he felt really
ashamed of what he did.

2001
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,400
He busts.

2002
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,140
Uh,

2003
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:05,650
uh,

2004
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,080
when they come into searcher Shi,

2005
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:07,350
she,

2006
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,040
Shi,

2007
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,550
uh,

2008
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,370
makes him,

2009
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,720
she pisses in front of him and says,

2010
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:12,010
you can look in my purse here.

2011
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,480
You can see I don't have anything here.

2012
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:14,170
Um,

2013
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:18,070
she's put on trial at the trial was
called the United States versus Billie

2014
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:18,401
holiday.

2015
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:19,840
And she said that's how it fucking felt.

2016
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,480
She sent to prison for 18 months.

2017
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,920
She doesn't say a word in prison,

2018
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,120
but what happened to her next I think
is the cruelest thing she gets out of

2019
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:28,954
prison.

2020
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:30,120
Um,

2021
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,860
and at that time to sing anywhere
where they served alcohol,

2022
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:35,290
you needed what was called a
cabaret performer's license.

2023
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,420
Anslinger make sure she doesn't get it.

2024
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,720
So one of her friends,

2025
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:39,491
you'll end up a van,

2026
00:57:39,491 --> 00:57:41,290
is also great jazz singer said to me,

2027
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,410
what's the cruelest thing you can do to
a person is to take away the thing they

2028
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:44,860
love,

2029
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:45,340
right?

2030
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,110
They take away singing
from Billie holiday.

2031
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,050
So what we do to people with addiction
problems all over the United States,

2032
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:50,620
right?

2033
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,770
We give them criminal records that make
it much harder to do the things that are

2034
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:54,910
meaningful to them by work.

2035
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:55,744
For example.

2036
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:56,890
Um,

2037
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,940
so in that situation,

2038
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,800
obviously Billie holiday relapses,

2039
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:00,041
right?

2040
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,870
She starts using a shit ton of heroin.

2041
00:58:01,871 --> 00:58:02,680
Again,

2042
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,240
a one day in the early 50.

2043
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:08,320
[inaudible] she collapses not far from
where she first song strange fruit.

2044
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:09,310
Um,

2045
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:13,060
the first hospital won't even take her
cause the cause she's got an addiction

2046
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:13,330
problem.

2047
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:16,150
They said we're not having
a second hospital takes her,

2048
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:17,230
but she says to her friend,

2049
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:22,231
Maili dusty on the way in the
Anslinger is men weren't done with her.

2050
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:23,330
They were going to come from,

2051
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,700
she said they're going
to kill me in there.

2052
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:25,451
Don't let them,

2053
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:26,284
they're going to kill me.

2054
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,660
She wasn't wrong in the hospital.

2055
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,820
She's diagnosed with
advanced liver cancer,

2056
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:33,010
um,

2057
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,900
probably related to severe alcoholism.

2058
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,393
Um,

2059
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,160
and in the hospital she,

2060
00:58:39,161 --> 00:58:39,820
um,

2061
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,200
she goes into heroin withdrawal.

2062
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,460
So mainly for our managers to insist that
she's giving methadone and she starts

2063
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:47,740
to recover a bit cause her McGraw's
quite dangerous when you're weak,

2064
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:47,921
right?

2065
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:48,990
Like when you're old or youth.

2066
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,403
Um,

2067
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:51,640
Ansley has men come,

2068
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:54,460
they arrest her on her hospital bed.

2069
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,500
They handcuffed her to the hospital.

2070
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:58,080
But I interviewed the last
person who was still alive.

2071
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:01,270
You've been in that room or a man called
Reverend Eugene calendar had been a

2072
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,170
religious minister.

2073
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:03,340
Um,

2074
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,990
they handcuffed her to a hospital bed.

2075
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,820
They don't have friends in to see her.

2076
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,460
They don't lie or even
have candies outside.

2077
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,470
Reverend calendar led
protests with signs saying,

2078
00:59:12,471 --> 00:59:13,720
Let Lady Day live.

2079
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,100
There were big protests.

2080
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:16,240
They knew they were killing her.

2081
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,070
Right?

2082
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:17,740
Um,

2083
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,730
then after 10 days,

2084
00:59:18,731 --> 00:59:19,790
they cut off the methadone.

2085
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,890
She died the next day.

2086
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:21,830
Her friend,

2087
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:21,980
one

2088
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,040
of her friends told the BBC
that she looked like she
had been violently wrenched

2089
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:25,874
from life.

2090
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,833
Right?

2091
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:30,950
There's loads of things about this
storage being made into a movie and Lee

2092
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:31,600
Daniels is directing it.

2093
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,433
Um,

2094
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,090
there's so many things about this story
that tells what this war on drugs is

2095
00:59:37,091 --> 00:59:37,391
about,

2096
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:37,870
right?

2097
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:38,703
Firstly,

2098
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:39,873
it's about,

2099
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:40,743
um,

2100
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,850
it's a fact.

2101
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,430
It's about shaming addicts and its
effect as it makes that it's worse,

2102
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:45,880
right?

2103
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:46,601
Is that with Billie holiday?

2104
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:47,434
See that everywhere.

2105
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,370
Secondly,

2106
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,440
it's been insanely racist from the start.

2107
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,100
Right?

2108
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:51,821
At the same time,

2109
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:54,130
the Harry Anslinger found out Billy
holiday had a heroin addiction.

2110
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,480
He found out Judy Garland,

2111
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,310
Dorothy from the wizard of
balls had a heroin addiction.

2112
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,410
It may change as I watched the
wizard of Oz where you know that,

2113
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,310
um,

2114
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:03,370
and he went to the
studio and he advised he,

2115
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,740
he said to Judy Garland into the studio,

2116
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,810
she should take longer vacations,

2117
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:10,150
right spot the difference
with a white woman,

2118
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:10,984
Judy Garland,

2119
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,640
longer vacations with Billie holiday,

2120
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:13,930
fucking destroy her,

2121
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,640
right?

2122
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:14,820
Uh,

2123
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,770
if at one of the agents he sent to
destroy her and my uncle George White,

2124
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:19,930
who has got a tractor in
the last days of her life,

2125
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:20,981
we now know,

2126
01:00:20,981 --> 01:00:21,170
I mean,

2127
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:22,900
he's literally a psychopath.

2128
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,930
He was a hugely obese
guys across strange guy.

2129
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:28,180
He infiltrated a Chinese drug
gang when he wasn't Chinese.

2130
01:00:28,181 --> 01:00:29,530
Any person to ever do that.

2131
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:29,861
But he,

2132
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:30,490
um,

2133
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,950
he boasted in his diary
about murdering people,

2134
01:00:32,951 --> 01:00:34,480
about spiking women and raping them.

2135
01:00:34,481 --> 01:00:34,900
I mean,

2136
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,880
these were really
deranged people that were,

2137
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,250
that founded the the drug will.

2138
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:43,390
But the reason I say in relation to what
we were just talking about is because

2139
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,220
in this culture,

2140
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:48,850
we tell only one heroic story about
people with addiction problems,

2141
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:51,040
and that's what they sometimes
recover from their addiction.

2142
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,200
That is indeed a heroic story.

2143
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:54,760
Everyone watching this has been,

2144
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:58,960
who's managed to do that is a hero and
I massively love and congratulate them,

2145
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,410
but that is not the only heroic story we
should tell about people with addiction

2146
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:03,244
problems.

2147
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,200
Billie holiday never stopped using drugs.

2148
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,850
She was still a fucking hero.

2149
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:08,170
She any,

2150
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,140
she never let these people
stop her singing that song.

2151
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,950
She would go to the places
where you didn't have a license,

2152
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:16,450
you'd go to the worst
parts of the deep south.

2153
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,280
She sang strange fruit.

2154
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:21,340
They people threw bottles at had
they stopped out cigarettes on her.

2155
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,590
She never stopped singing that song.

2156
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,633
Right?

2157
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,980
And I think about Billie Holiday a lot.

2158
01:01:26,981 --> 01:01:27,814
And I think about,

2159
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,273
you know,

2160
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,280
all over the world,

2161
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,490
every day people listen to Billie holiday
and they feel stronger and all over

2162
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:36,851
the world,

2163
01:01:36,851 --> 01:01:40,330
every day we are still
following the policies of
Harry Anslinger and it makes us

2164
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:41,164
weaker.

2165
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:45,880
And this conflict that begins
right at the start of the drug.

2166
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,440
And I think if I'm honest,

2167
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:50,290
I think this isn't an easy thing to say,

2168
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:55,291
but I think one of the reasons why the
debate about the drug wars so charged is

2169
01:01:55,541 --> 01:01:56,860
because it runs through
the hearts of all of us,

2170
01:01:56,861 --> 01:01:57,041
right?

2171
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:59,710
Anyone who's got someone they love
has got an addiction problem as I do

2172
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:03,700
a Harry Anslinger in your head,

2173
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:04,301
right?

2174
01:02:04,301 --> 01:02:06,880
There's a bit of view that looks at them
and thinks someone should just fucking

2175
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:07,570
stop here.

2176
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:08,740
Why are you doing this?

2177
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,690
Someone should stop you doing this.

2178
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,070
And then for most people,

2179
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:13,510
there's another part that's like,

2180
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,160
okay,

2181
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,530
that anger isn't useful in most cases.

2182
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:18,783
Um,

2183
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,090
actually what you're
doing this for a reason.

2184
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:22,260
We need to understand those reasons.

2185
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:23,940
We need to help you to change your life,

2186
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:24,774
right?

2187
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,810
But that conflict is,

2188
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:27,041
is,

2189
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:28,500
is very deep in us.

2190
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:31,890
And Harry Anslinger the war he invented.

2191
01:02:31,891 --> 01:02:33,840
And we can talk about what he did with
cannabis and lots of other things,

2192
01:02:33,841 --> 01:02:36,930
but because he invented
the ban on cannabis,

2193
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,680
that that war is,

2194
01:02:39,681 --> 01:02:40,291
is still playing it.

2195
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:40,921
Does that make sense?

2196
01:02:40,921 --> 01:02:41,820
I know that was a long answer,

2197
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:43,440
but that's all right.

2198
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:43,921
No,

2199
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:44,890
it does make sense of it.

2200
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,040
It's a horrific story about Billy all day.

2201
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:52,400
And I had no idea that I'm Dorothy from
the wizard of Oz was also addicted.

2202
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:53,220
Did you?

2203
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,480
The munchkins a lot of them as well.

2204
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:55,650
Now,

2205
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:00,650
Harry W W W why was Harry Anslinger
is hate towards her so extreme.

2206
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:02,880
So when he was a kid,

2207
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:04,260
the book is called chasing the screen.

2208
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,101
Cause when he was a kid,

2209
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:07,110
he grew up in a place called
Altoona in Pennsylvania.

2210
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:09,060
And he,

2211
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,380
he lives in a farm house.

2212
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:13,020
His Dad was actually a refugee from swell
refugee and a bit comes immigrant from

2213
01:03:13,021 --> 01:03:13,854
Switzerland.

2214
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,733
Um,

2215
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:17,370
and they grew up in this farm house.

2216
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:19,260
And in the next farm
house down there was a,

2217
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,151
a,

2218
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:21,984
um,

2219
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,221
a farmer's wife.

2220
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:25,170
You had an a heroin addiction or methods,

2221
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:25,381
sorry,

2222
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:26,940
morphine addiction
would've been hiring them.

2223
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,650
And Harry Anslinger had this really
haunting memory of going to that house and

2224
01:03:31,651 --> 01:03:35,750
hearing this woman's scream and scream
and him being sent to take the wholesome,

2225
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,920
I think it was 11 or
something being sent to tight,

2226
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:41,010
the Holston caught into town to go to
the pharmacy to get her the morphine and

2227
01:03:41,011 --> 01:03:42,640
then bringing it back in her scream,

2228
01:03:42,641 --> 01:03:43,474
stopping.

2229
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,590
The lesson he took from that is these
drugs are evil and we need to destroy

2230
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:47,424
them.

2231
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,080
Especially later on.

2232
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:49,470
He,

2233
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:53,490
he was in Europe during the first
world war and he had this very keen,

2234
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:54,403
was a diplomat.

2235
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:59,760
We had this very keen sense that
civilization was incredibly fragile.

2236
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:01,500
It could collapse at any moment,

2237
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:05,130
that you only need a little bit of
contamination and it will all go to shit.

2238
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,450
Um,

2239
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:06,721
and,

2240
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:07,001
and,

2241
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:07,920
and so he,

2242
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,031
yeah,

2243
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:09,811
I call it chasing the screen.

2244
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:12,720
Cause I think in a way what
Harry Anslinger is doing
is like chasing the scream

2245
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:13,291
all over the world.

2246
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:13,711
And I felt like,

2247
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:13,890
well,

2248
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:14,401
I was doing,

2249
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:16,950
going to all these different places
from the killing fields in Mexico to

2250
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:17,761
Portugal.

2251
01:04:17,761 --> 01:04:19,350
And Switzerland was like,

2252
01:04:19,351 --> 01:04:21,570
following this scream as it
kind of ricocheted around.

2253
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:25,470
And actually how he made he thinks
he's stopping these screams is actually

2254
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:27,450
creating far more screams in their,

2255
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:28,321
in their,

2256
01:04:28,321 --> 01:04:29,280
in their place.

2257
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:30,391
Yeah.

2258
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:33,810
But I still don't understand why
he had this intensity holiday so,

2259
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,530
well,

2260
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:38,190
she's an African American woman standing
up to white supremacy who has an

2261
01:04:38,191 --> 01:04:39,000
addiction problem.

2262
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,580
But the truth is what he did to
Billie holiday is not a party.

2263
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,833
It's not,

2264
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:46,290
this is what you did to African Americans
and people with addiction problems.

2265
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:46,911
Billie holiday.

2266
01:04:46,911 --> 01:04:47,950
It happens to be famous.

2267
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:48,900
So I'm telling her story,

2268
01:04:48,901 --> 01:04:51,510
but this is what he did
to huge numbers of people,

2269
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:52,020
right?

2270
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,940
He wanted to destroy the whole jazz scene.

2271
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,160
One of the amazing thing
is spending time in his,

2272
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:56,970
um,

2273
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:00,750
archives in Penn state was
seeing all these memos from,

2274
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,440
uh,

2275
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,100
his agents.

2276
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:02,551
We said to them,

2277
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:03,810
go to your local jazz club,

2278
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,710
document the evil things that happening
there and the things they wrote back.

2279
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:08,730
I caught a hilarious,

2280
01:05:08,731 --> 01:05:08,881
right,

2281
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:10,410
there's one agent who,

2282
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:11,071
I forget where it was,

2283
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:12,510
but he wrote back and was like,

2284
01:05:12,511 --> 01:05:13,050
um,

2285
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:14,880
there was a popular jazz
song at the time called,

2286
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:15,300
uh,

2287
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,440
that ocean ma'am,

2288
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,130
and had a lyric that said,

2289
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,660
when he gets the notion,

2290
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,640
he thinks he can walk across the ocean.

2291
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:22,810
And he's like,

2292
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:26,230
there was gonna be an epidemic of drowning
across the United States as people

2293
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:29,650
use cannabis because they're going
to believe they can walk on water.

2294
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,430
So he would,

2295
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:31,263
he was like,

2296
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:31,540
look,

2297
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,231
you're the hilarious.

2298
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:33,064
We were things he said,

2299
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:33,640
you know,

2300
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,010
he believed that when you smoke cannabis,

2301
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:37,060
time slows down.

2302
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:39,460
So a minute seems to
last a thousand years.

2303
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,500
Like these extraordinarily heightened,

2304
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:43,150
crazy things that he would,

2305
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:43,870
he would say.

2306
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,621
And he actually latched.

2307
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:48,700
So at that time when he first takes
over what becomes the Federal Bureau of

2308
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:49,540
narcotics,

2309
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:50,650
you know,

2310
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,180
cocaine and heroin start very popular,

2311
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:52,421
right?

2312
01:05:52,421 --> 01:05:53,920
There's just not much of a war to fight.

2313
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:54,161
I mean,

2314
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:54,671
they exist,

2315
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:57,940
but they're not that popular quite
that can find a small urban scenes.

2316
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,440
Cannabis was more popular,

2317
01:05:59,441 --> 01:06:00,370
not as popular as it is now,

2318
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:01,860
but an,

2319
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:04,330
and he had previously said,

2320
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,950
cannabis isn't harmful,

2321
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:07,540
not bothered about it.

2322
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,411
He suddenly,

2323
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:09,280
when he cottons on that,

2324
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,350
this is the way to big
buildup his department,

2325
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,880
he announces that cannabis is,

2326
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,280
the phrase he used was the
most evil drug in the world.

2327
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:19,600
He said when Frankenstein's monster
bumps into a spliff on the staircase,

2328
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,400
Frankenstein's monster dies of fright,

2329
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:24,310
like at extraordinarily heightened claims.

2330
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,533
Um,

2331
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,373
and,

2332
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:26,920
and any,

2333
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,740
any issues just trying to get
support for a ban on cannabis.

2334
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,050
And he latches onto
one case in particular.

2335
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:32,981
I some point,

2336
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:34,090
cause I think we're hearing these again,

2337
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,140
these things again now.

2338
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,040
Um,

2339
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,330
so a kid in Tampa,

2340
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:38,920
Florida called Victor Lacarta,

2341
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:40,000
who was not so much a kid,

2342
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:43,180
21 killed his entire family with an ax,

2343
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:46,840
but should the mall and with the
help of the Fox News of its time,

2344
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:47,320
Hearst,

2345
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,340
Hearst newspapers,

2346
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,743
uh,

2347
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:53,350
Anslinger announces this is what
will happen if you use cannabis.

2348
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:53,861
Literally,

2349
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:55,750
you will kill your family with an ax.

2350
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,673
Right?

2351
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,710
And this becomes a very famous
story across the United States.

2352
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,030
And cannabis is banned in its wake.

2353
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:01,871
Years later,

2354
01:07:01,871 --> 01:07:04,210
someone goes and checks the psychiatric
files for bit till I kind of,

2355
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:06,340
it wasn't even evidence
it'd be used cannabis,

2356
01:07:06,341 --> 01:07:06,760
right,

2357
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,190
is he'd had terrible
problems with psychosis.

2358
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:12,040
His family had been advised more
than a year before that he should be

2359
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:13,420
institutionalized and they refused.

2360
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:14,111
They kept him at home.

2361
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:16,480
And this tragedy ensued.

2362
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:17,980
We're hearing these,

2363
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:19,240
these scare stories again about,

2364
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,570
about cannabis as something that Anslinger
said that I think could be like the

2365
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:27,571
motto for the entire drug war in the
wake of the Anslinger introduces this ban

2366
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:30,670
in the u s he promises
drugs will disappear,

2367
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:31,623
right?

2368
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,610
You will notice drugs did not disappear.

2369
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:34,421
He starts to say,

2370
01:07:34,421 --> 01:07:35,470
well that's just cause evil.

2371
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:38,650
Foreign countries like Mexico are
flooding our country with drugs.

2372
01:07:38,651 --> 01:07:39,940
You'll notice that's come back as well.

2373
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:40,960
Um,

2374
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,660
so what we need to do is force all these
other countries to band them as well,

2375
01:07:43,661 --> 01:07:44,680
and then they'll disappear.

2376
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,200
So the u s in the wake of the Second
World War where it has the power to do

2377
01:07:47,201 --> 01:07:47,300
that,

2378
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,190
the world is in ruins.

2379
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:49,300
Um,

2380
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,840
and there's one point when he goes to
the new United Nations and he's insisting

2381
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:54,610
this happens and they're
basically threatening people.

2382
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:55,444
They're saying,

2383
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,930
we'll cut off your foreign aid or you
won't be allowed to sell goods to the US

2384
01:07:58,931 --> 01:08:00,550
market if you don't do this.

2385
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,950
The ambassador from Thailand is like,

2386
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:03,461
well,

2387
01:08:03,461 --> 01:08:03,611
you know,

2388
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:05,320
it doesn't seem to work
very well in your country.

2389
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:07,800
We've actually got a long pattern
of established drug use in,

2390
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:08,711
in Thailand.

2391
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:10,060
We don't really have many problems.

2392
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:11,600
We don't want to do this and answer thing.

2393
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:12,434
I said to her,

2394
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,293
I said to him,

2395
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:14,770
I've made up my mind,

2396
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,040
don't try to confuse

2397
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,030
me with the facts.

2398
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,120
And I always feel like
that's the drug war.

2399
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:20,540
Right.

2400
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,380
And made up my mind,

2401
01:08:21,381 --> 01:08:23,060
don't try to confuse me with the facts.

2402
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,230
While he,

2403
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:26,780
in conjunction with a
William Randolph Hearst,

2404
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,960
he worked with him to try to propagate
these ridiculous propaganda stories about

2405
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:37,781
Mexicans and blacks smoking
this evil drug called marijuana,

2406
01:08:38,091 --> 01:08:41,630
which is really not even a real
term for cannabis at the time.

2407
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:42,740
It was a sound.

2408
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:43,690
It's wild.

2409
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,030
Yeah.

2410
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,650
It was a wild Mexican tobacco,

2411
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:46,070
right?

2412
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:46,720
Yeah.

2413
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,360
Um,

2414
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,360
but then didn't Nixon do a similar thing
with the sweeping psychedelic act of

2415
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:57,260
1970 he did it so that they
could infiltrate the civil
rights movement because

2416
01:08:57,261 --> 01:09:00,650
there were so many people in the civil
rights movement that we're using various

2417
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:01,970
psychedelic drugs.

2418
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,660
They could use it as an excuse to crack
down on them and lock them up and put

2419
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:08,050
them in jail and pit them
against each other and you know,

2420
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,500
have them inform on each other.

2421
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:10,130
Yeah.

2422
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:10,970
This is really important.

2423
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:14,300
You cannot enforce the drug laws
against everyone who's broken than it is

2424
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:15,223
impossible.

2425
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:18,480
Half of all Americans by conservative
estimate of broken the drug laws.

2426
01:09:18,481 --> 01:09:19,160
Right.

2427
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,930
So what do you do everywhere in the world?

2428
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,720
The drug laws are used
to persecute groups.

2429
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:25,820
The state wants to persecute
him for other reasons,

2430
01:09:25,821 --> 01:09:26,170
right?

2431
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:26,570
Yeah.

2432
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:30,890
So one of the people I wrote about
in chasing the scream is a wound.

2433
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:32,840
He really had a kind
of epiphany about this,

2434
01:09:32,841 --> 01:09:33,350
right?

2435
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,750
So Lee Maddox was a cop in Baltimore.

2436
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,450
She used to do the [inaudible] she would,

2437
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:42,260
and she would very proudly bust
people who even had a single joint.

2438
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:42,590
Right.

2439
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:44,630
She was a real Harry
answering his dream go.

2440
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,520
And she had signed up to become a cop,

2441
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:47,190
which is amazing.

2442
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:47,570
Interesting.

2443
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:48,230
Personally,

2444
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:51,080
she'd signed up to come cop for
quite personal reason as a kid.

2445
01:09:51,081 --> 01:09:51,914
She'd had a best friend,

2446
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,730
couldn't teenager called Elisa.

2447
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:55,310
Uh,

2448
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:55,970
he was like,

2449
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:56,960
they looked really similar.

2450
01:09:56,961 --> 01:09:58,220
They shared a fake Id.

2451
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,660
They were like sisters.

2452
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,570
And one day when they
were in the late teens,

2453
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:07,571
they went to ocean city for day out and
Lisa decided to hitchhike back to New

2454
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:08,743
Jersey where she lived.

2455
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:09,883
And uh,

2456
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,190
so Lisa bye to her and the next
day she gets a call saying,

2457
01:10:13,191 --> 01:10:14,510
Lisa had not arrived.

2458
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:16,200
So she waits and way.

2459
01:10:16,201 --> 01:10:18,860
It's just this terrible summer
waiting to find out what happened.

2460
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,140
And then they discovered that Lisa had
been gang raped and murdered at body,

2461
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:26,720
was found underneath the house
where had been eaten by animals.

2462
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:27,923
Um,

2463
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,510
and Lee becomes,

2464
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:30,970
became convinced at that time that,

2465
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:34,910
that Lisa had for spares reasons that
Lisa had been killed as part of a gang

2466
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:35,840
initiation ceremony.

2467
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:36,120
She's like,

2468
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:36,650
she's like,

2469
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,120
I'm going to destroy these gangs,

2470
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:39,950
going to dedicate my life
to destroying these gangs.

2471
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:44,210
She goes and applies to become a police
officer and for years she's this,

2472
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,380
you know,

2473
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,210
hardline cop,

2474
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:47,870
right?

2475
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:50,060
It takes real pleasure in busting people,

2476
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,730
but least started to notice a few things.

2477
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,070
First thing was,

2478
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,000
um,

2479
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,190
when you were a cop and
you arrest a rapist,

2480
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,590
there are fewer rapes in
your town the next week,

2481
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:01,250
right?

2482
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,130
When you are copying,

2483
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:03,050
you bust a pedophile,

2484
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,820
fewer children get sexually abused,

2485
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:07,040
but she knows when you bust a dealer,

2486
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,680
there's no fewer dealers.

2487
01:11:09,681 --> 01:11:11,300
There's someone on the
corner the next day for sure,

2488
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:11,900
right?

2489
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,860
It didn't seem to be having any effect.

2490
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,191
In fact,

2491
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:15,510
what she discovered while she was,

2492
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:17,820
she began to learn about this
was that there was something,

2493
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:18,330
uh,

2494
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:19,230
even worse,

2495
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:19,700
which was,

2496
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,533
um,

2497
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,930
if for any sort of reason
that she realized that she
was actually creating these

2498
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:26,940
empowering these gangs.

2499
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,100
So the best way to explain
this is if you imagine,

2500
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,230
obviously when you,

2501
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,130
when you ban drugs,

2502
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:32,964
they don't disappear,

2503
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,300
right?

2504
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,670
That transferred from the people
who are used to control them,

2505
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:39,030
licensed legal businesses
to armed criminal gangs,

2506
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:39,181
right?

2507
01:11:39,181 --> 01:11:41,610
And these aren't criminal gangs
operate in a different way to,

2508
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,100
to,

2509
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:42,970
to legal businesses.

2510
01:11:42,971 --> 01:11:46,380
So if you imagine if you and me decided
we want to go and steal now a bottle of

2511
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:46,980
vodka,

2512
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:47,580
right?

2513
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,580
We're going to local liquor
store and that store catches us,

2514
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,200
they'll call the cops.

2515
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:53,460
The cops will come and take us away.

2516
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,290
That liquor store doesn't
need to be violent.

2517
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,490
It doesn't need to be intimidating.

2518
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,700
They've got the power of the law
to uphold their property rights.

2519
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,250
Can now imagine we were
to steal a bag of coke,

2520
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,173
right?

2521
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,310
If we go to the guy near here,

2522
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,420
I'm sure there is someone who,

2523
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:05,900
who,

2524
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:06,690
um,

2525
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:07,523
sells coke,

2526
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:08,543
um,

2527
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:09,390
and he catches us.

2528
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:10,470
He can't call the cops.

2529
01:12:10,471 --> 01:12:12,030
Obviously cops would arrest him.

2530
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:13,380
He has to fight us.

2531
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,401
Now if you're a dealer,

2532
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:16,140
you don't want to be
having a fight every day,

2533
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:16,500
right?

2534
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,740
You want to establish a reputation for
being so frightening that no one would

2535
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:20,580
dare to fuck with you,

2536
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:21,090
right?

2537
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:21,441
So you,

2538
01:12:21,441 --> 01:12:23,850
you establish your place in that
neighborhood through aggression,

2539
01:12:23,851 --> 01:12:24,480
through violence,

2540
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,490
and you maintain it through
aggression and violence,

2541
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:27,080
right?

2542
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:27,270
Uh,

2543
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:32,270
legal businesses compete on cost and
quality of product in illegal markets.

2544
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:36,270
People compete on how much of a
frightening fucker you're prepared to be,

2545
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:37,000
right?

2546
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,810
And as a writer called
Charles Bout and put it,

2547
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:44,160
the war on drugs creates a war for drugs,

2548
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:44,550
right?

2549
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:49,140
It transfers it to these criminal gangs
who have to operate through violence to

2550
01:12:49,141 --> 01:12:50,250
protect their property rights.

2551
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:55,460
So link goes into the drug war thinking
I'm the one stopping these gangs.

2552
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,760
She realizes she,

2553
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,560
I'm the one enabling them,

2554
01:12:58,561 --> 01:12:59,010
right?

2555
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:02,910
They control one of the biggest industries
in the world because of this police

2556
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:03,240
action.

2557
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,060
And because of this decision
to prohibit these drugs,

2558
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:09,480
and if you want to know how much
of this violence is caused by,

2559
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:10,141
by,

2560
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:10,974
um,

2561
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,810
by the fact that we prohibited it,

2562
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:13,980
just ask yourself,

2563
01:13:13,981 --> 01:13:15,540
where are the violent alcohol dealers,

2564
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,583
right?

2565
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,810
Everyone knows who al Capone was.

2566
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:22,860
Does the head of Smirnoff go and shoot
that had a Budweiser in the face?

2567
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:23,430
Right?

2568
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:26,400
Does your local bar go and send a bunch
of kids to go and shoot everyone in the

2569
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,234
next bar down?

2570
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:30,360
Of course not exactly that happened
and the alcohol prohibition,

2571
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:35,220
when did it end ended on the day alcohol
prohibition ended because legal markets

2572
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:36,263
don't compete with that.

2573
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:37,770
So at least partly having this insight,

2574
01:13:37,771 --> 01:13:37,981
right?

2575
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:38,814
She's realizing,

2576
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:39,330
Shit,

2577
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:40,680
I think I'm taking down these gangs.

2578
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:41,730
I'm actually empowering them.

2579
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:45,570
What will really disempowered them as
reclaiming the market and making it legal.

2580
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,780
But she also has another
really painful realization.

2581
01:13:48,781 --> 01:13:50,550
So early in her career as a cop,

2582
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,080
Lee had done this really brave thing.

2583
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,140
She'd gone undercover with
the clan to expose them.

2584
01:13:55,141 --> 01:13:58,830
She'd done a really important work in
breaking up parts of the Maryland clam.

2585
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,480
She really was not a racist,

2586
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:00,631
right?

2587
01:14:00,631 --> 01:14:02,340
She'd had relationships
with African American men,

2588
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,300
but she knows something
that most on is cops notice,

2589
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:09,810
which is the vast majority of people,

2590
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,140
the,

2591
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,340
they were sent to African areas to enforce

2592
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:12,941
the drug laws.

2593
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:13,750
Right.

2594
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,471
One of our colleagues,

2595
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:15,304
Matthew fog,

2596
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:18,520
once went to his superior
officer and said,

2597
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:19,354
you know,

2598
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:20,741
this is a bit weird,

2599
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:21,370
right?

2600
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:24,160
We only ever seem to go to African
American neighborhoods to do all our drug

2601
01:14:24,161 --> 01:14:24,970
busts.

2602
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:27,340
I'm fairly sure white
people sometimes use drug.

2603
01:14:27,341 --> 01:14:29,260
Should we go to like a
white neighborhood as well?

2604
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,550
And the supervisor said,

2605
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:31,384
of course you're right.

2606
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,590
White people use drugs,

2607
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:33,941
but white people,

2608
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:36,220
no journalists and lawyers and judges.

2609
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:36,990
That's really,

2610
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:38,680
we that's just get a
whole load of shit for us.

2611
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,300
Just go for the low hanging fruit.

2612
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,370
So Lee who is not a racist,

2613
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,170
could see the effect of what she
was doing was in fact racist.

2614
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:47,441
Right.

2615
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,820
And she was very uncomfortable with that.

2616
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:52,900
And this really came to a head Billy
when Lee's police partner was guy called

2617
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:53,111
Ed.

2618
01:14:53,111 --> 01:14:53,621
Totally.

2619
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:54,730
Who she loved.

2620
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:55,750
Platonically loved.

2621
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:56,620
Um,

2622
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:56,741
yeah,

2623
01:14:56,741 --> 01:14:58,690
he was a great champion
of women police officers.

2624
01:14:58,691 --> 01:14:59,650
It was a great guy.

2625
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,570
And one day she gets a call at home.

2626
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,460
Ed had been sent on a drug bust.

2627
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:05,510
He was undercover and uh,

2628
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,630
the guy had thought it was ripping
him off and shot him in the head.

2629
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,640
And lead goes to see eds body.

2630
01:15:09,641 --> 01:15:10,474
And she's like,

2631
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,130
what did he die for?

2632
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:12,671
Right?

2633
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:14,230
There are no fewer drug dealers.

2634
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,210
Every time we arrest the drug dealer,

2635
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:19,240
the supply of drugs is not
disrupted for one hour.

2636
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,210
We are enforcing a racist war.

2637
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:23,950
We are empowering these gangs.

2638
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:25,330
Why are we doing this?

2639
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:27,940
So Lee quit as a police officer,

2640
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:29,470
she retrained as a lawyer.

2641
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:32,500
She now gets the criminal records
expunged wherever she can have the kind of

2642
01:15:32,501 --> 01:15:35,500
people that she busted when
she was a cop and she's a big,

2643
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:38,410
she was part of the brilliant group
called law enforcement against prohibition

2644
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:41,560
who are cops who argue
for ending the drug war.

2645
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:46,750
But it's interesting to me because it's
hard to be Harry Lee was trying to be

2646
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:50,710
Harry Anslinger is hard to
be Harry Anslinger if you're
an honest person with a

2647
01:15:50,711 --> 01:15:51,490
conscience,

2648
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,323
right?

2649
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:55,270
And there are police officers all
over the country who are making these,

2650
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:55,541
these,

2651
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:57,400
these realizations now and that,

2652
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:59,703
you know,

2653
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,580
obviously it's very close to my heart,

2654
01:16:03,581 --> 01:16:05,290
what we do to people
with addiction problems.

2655
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:07,513
I don't.

2656
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,100
Horrific and catastrophic though.

2657
01:16:09,101 --> 01:16:09,934
That is,

2658
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,360
I don't actually think that's the biggest
moral issue around the war on drugs.

2659
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:17,020
The biggest moral issue is the
violence created by prohibition,

2660
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:17,830
right?

2661
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:20,290
If I think about places I've
spent time like Columbia,

2662
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:20,640
um,

2663
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,700
see it at Horace in,

2664
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:23,320
in northern Mexico,

2665
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:24,700
that's the biggest issue,

2666
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:24,881
right?

2667
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:25,870
More people have died in,

2668
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:27,310
in Latin America,

2669
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:29,440
central and South America,

2670
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:30,730
in the drug war,

2671
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:32,620
violence than have died in Syria.

2672
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:34,090
I don't know what we can do about Syria.

2673
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,330
We can end this violence as
professor at Harvard could.

2674
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:42,331
Jeffrey Myron [inaudible] has a graph of
the murder rate in the 20th century in

2675
01:16:43,691 --> 01:16:44,524
the United States,

2676
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,240
massively shoots up the day.

2677
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:48,220
Alcohol is banned and fools like a stone.

2678
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:49,450
The day alcohol is legalized,

2679
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:50,080
right?

2680
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,020
And massively rises again when there's
an intensification of the drug war later,

2681
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:54,323
um,

2682
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,260
we can end a huge amount of this violence,

2683
01:16:56,261 --> 01:16:56,381
right?

2684
01:16:56,381 --> 01:16:57,400
We can do what Switzerland did.

2685
01:16:57,401 --> 01:16:58,860
We can do what,

2686
01:16:58,861 --> 01:17:00,490
what's happening here
and what's stopping us.

2687
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:06,160
So I think the main thing is this is a
logical conclusion based on facts and

2688
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:08,950
based on cases like
Portugal and Switzerland,

2689
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,220
there's obviously data.

2690
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,170
So people are aware of this.

2691
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,300
So people must be
confronted with this data.

2692
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,111
To this day,

2693
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:18,830
people know that the prohibition on
alcohol was a massive disaster and no one

2694
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:20,300
would ever accept it again.

2695
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,180
We're slowly starting to
realize that marijuana,

2696
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,010
at least for some people is,

2697
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:28,970
is safe and reasonable and should be
used recreationally and has some massive

2698
01:17:28,971 --> 01:17:29,900
benefits medically.

2699
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:35,380
So we're starting to see legalization
both for recreational use and,

2700
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:35,900
uh,

2701
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,520
clearly for medical uses spread.

2702
01:17:37,521 --> 01:17:38,300
I think,

2703
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,950
what did we decide what it was?

2704
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:40,190
It,

2705
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:45,190
I think it's like there's a certain amount
of states where it's just fully legal

2706
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:49,100
recreationally and more
where it's medical,

2707
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:51,330
but I think it's more
than 18 states total knee.

2708
01:17:51,331 --> 01:17:54,840
As soon we're going to be half of the
American population should be 100%.

2709
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:55,461
I mean,

2710
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:57,680
we all is in Canada and it should be,

2711
01:17:57,681 --> 01:18:00,440
yes it is in Canada as
it should be for alcohol.

2712
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:01,603
But what,

2713
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,840
what is the stop?

2714
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:07,640
What is the wall between this and
legalization of all these other drugs and

2715
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:11,480
counseling and implementing some
sort of a Switzerland like program?

2716
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,730
The think going to the
really important question.

2717
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,260
So there's a range of things.

2718
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:16,110
Um,

2719
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:17,210
this is a public perception.

2720
01:18:17,211 --> 01:18:18,044
A big one.

2721
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,310
I think you've gone to the most important,

2722
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:19,521
right?

2723
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:22,340
So some people say it's the vested
financial interest in the existing system.

2724
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,623
That's true.

2725
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:26,810
If you look at who funds the no campaigns,

2726
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:28,130
whenever they want to legalize marijuana,

2727
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:29,200
you can see the interest,

2728
01:18:29,201 --> 01:18:29,810
right?

2729
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,100
Prison guard unions,

2730
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:32,210
um,

2731
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:35,180
alcohol companies cause they didn't
want a commercial competitor.

2732
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:35,960
Um,

2733
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,730
religious fundamentalist
groups like Mormons,

2734
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,110
not the all Mormons fundamentalist,

2735
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:40,490
but the grips that funding this are,

2736
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:41,673
um,

2737
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,190
so it's partly that,

2738
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:44,024
but I think you're right.

2739
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,560
I don't think that's the
main thing that's going on.

2740
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:45,701
It's,

2741
01:18:45,701 --> 01:18:47,090
it's significant and real,

2742
01:18:47,091 --> 01:18:48,170
but it's the main thing that's going on.

2743
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:49,280
The main thing,

2744
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:50,420
the main block is

2745
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:52,671
huge.

2746
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,870
Majority of Americans,

2747
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,230
more than 80% said the war on drugs
has failed and been a disaster.

2748
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:00,110
And yet most people are
afraid of the alternatives.

2749
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:00,800
Right?

2750
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,900
And that's pot setting.

2751
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:02,743
There's two things going on.

2752
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:05,390
There's ignorance about what
the alternatives actually mean.

2753
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:09,950
So re one of the reasons why chasing
sqream is written as I went to all these

2754
01:19:09,951 --> 01:19:14,480
places from the killing fields in northern
Mexico to Switzerland is because way

2755
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:18,260
too often in this debate we talk
like we're a philosophy seminar.

2756
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:18,830
People go,

2757
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:20,450
or what would legalization mean?

2758
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,201
How would it work?

2759
01:19:21,201 --> 01:19:24,680
And they go into this weird abstract
conversation like fuck that.

2760
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,270
Here's a plane ticket to Geneva,

2761
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,060
here's a plane ticket to Lisbon
is a plane ticket to Colorado,

2762
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:29,600
right?

2763
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,100
It's not rocket science.

2764
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:31,310
Right?

2765
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:33,440
I've been to the places that
have tried these things.

2766
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,150
We can see the results,

2767
01:19:35,151 --> 01:19:35,451
right?

2768
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:38,720
Then they're not legalization is not
an APP or decrement decriminalization.

2769
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:42,050
I explain the difference if
you want are not abstract.

2770
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:45,350
What's the key differences between
legalization and decriminalization?

2771
01:19:45,351 --> 01:19:48,020
Decriminalization is where
you stop punishing users,

2772
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:50,990
but they still have to go to armed
criminal gangs to get their drug.

2773
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:54,830
Legalization is where you open up some
legal route for people to get their

2774
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:55,131
drugs.

2775
01:19:55,131 --> 01:19:57,020
And that's varies according to the drug,

2776
01:19:57,021 --> 01:19:57,470
right?

2777
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:00,800
So I guess the kind of headline would
be decriminalization shuts down.

2778
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:04,190
Orange is the new black and legalization
shuts down breaking bad and Naacos

2779
01:20:04,191 --> 01:20:04,640
right.

2780
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,421
And of course we need to do,

2781
01:20:05,421 --> 01:20:08,250
but you're throwing to decriminalize
use and legalize supply.

2782
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:11,340
Mexico decriminalize a lot of
drugs like fairly recently.

2783
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,540
Yes.

2784
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,650
That a big supreme court decision aspect.

2785
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:16,190
A lot of time in Mexico.

2786
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:18,780
And I think about,

2787
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:23,550
I think about this time I
spent in Mexico really often

2788
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,013
because it was,

2789
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:26,930
I'm going to cover it.

2790
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:27,010
I,

2791
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:27,210
you know,

2792
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:28,590
I've been to a lot of bad places.

2793
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:29,910
I covered the war in the Congo.

2794
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:30,870
I've been to Iraq,

2795
01:20:30,871 --> 01:20:31,704
I've been to Gaza.

2796
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,130
I've never seen anything like
what happened to horrors when,

2797
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:35,023
when I was there,

2798
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,233
the,

2799
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:37,800
you know,

2800
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,090
I think it's worth explaining.

2801
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,460
So when you,

2802
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:43,761
like I was saying,

2803
01:20:43,761 --> 01:20:45,710
when you ban drugs that it disappear,

2804
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:46,100
right?

2805
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,630
The transfer to armed criminal gangs.

2806
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:52,960
If you live in a housing project in the
United States where 5% of the economy at

2807
01:20:53,091 --> 01:20:54,980
that housing project is in the
hands of armed criminal gangs,

2808
01:20:54,981 --> 01:20:55,701
that's going to be a shitty,

2809
01:20:55,701 --> 01:20:58,210
frightening place to be right place.

2810
01:20:58,211 --> 01:20:59,180
I see it at Horace,

2811
01:20:59,350 --> 01:20:59,570
uh,

2812
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:03,290
which is on the border with Mexican side
of the United States border with them.

2813
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,690
It's the other side with our Paso.

2814
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:07,123
Um,

2815
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:08,240
by the time I went there,

2816
01:21:08,241 --> 01:21:09,380
it was 70%,

2817
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:12,350
seven 0% of the economy was in the
hands of these armed criminal gangs.

2818
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,310
Right.

2819
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:14,600
So I remember

2820
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:16,971
going to see this guy,

2821
01:21:16,971 --> 01:21:18,160
Ross Saleo Retta,

2822
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:18,930
uh,

2823
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,210
interview people about him and horrors.

2824
01:21:20,211 --> 01:21:20,691
But then I went to,

2825
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:25,691
he's in prison in the United States
is in Tyler County and Rosalia it's

2826
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:26,510
interesting guys.

2827
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:31,510
He butchered or beheaded about 70
people between the ages of 13 and 17 to,

2828
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,540
um,

2829
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,190
I'm going into the prison
actually to see him.

2830
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,840
And the guard said to me on the way in,

2831
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:38,680
but obviously I can't leave you
alone with him cause he's like,

2832
01:21:38,681 --> 01:21:38,991
but shit,

2833
01:21:38,991 --> 01:21:39,531
all these people,

2834
01:21:39,531 --> 01:21:39,861
I was like,

2835
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:40,281
oh great,

2836
01:21:40,281 --> 01:21:41,114
thanks.

2837
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,820
And we have about five minutes until
around the guard was fucking God.

2838
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:48,170
But I'm just saying we've Rosario
talking about his life and his,

2839
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,373
his story.

2840
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:51,620
So Rozalia grew up in Laredo,

2841
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:53,301
Texas side of the border.

2842
01:21:53,301 --> 01:21:55,090
It's basically the same places.

2843
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:56,210
Nuevo Laredo on the,

2844
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:57,260
on the Mexican side.

2845
01:21:57,261 --> 01:21:58,970
It was pretty easy to cross
the border at that time.

2846
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,060
Secret he was growing
up in the late nineties.

2847
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:04,160
Noughties remember Sally,

2848
01:22:04,161 --> 01:22:05,630
I was 13 so loads get,

2849
01:22:05,631 --> 01:22:07,850
the designers were kind of
famous drug gang at that time.

2850
01:22:07,851 --> 01:22:09,950
They still are a good drug cartel.

2851
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,240
How does Etas were created?

2852
01:22:11,241 --> 01:22:12,080
It's an insane story.

2853
01:22:12,081 --> 01:22:13,220
Every tax payer should know.

2854
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:18,260
The US government decided to train
and elite anti drug force for the,

2855
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,310
for the Mexican government,

2856
01:22:19,311 --> 01:22:19,520
right?

2857
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,270
Like kind of navy seals for the anti-drug
force or they take them to Fort Bragg.

2858
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,670
They spent something like
$250 million training them up.

2859
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:26,810
They go back to Mexico.

2860
01:22:26,811 --> 01:22:29,180
Six months later they
all defected on mass.

2861
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,133
Almost all of them.

2862
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:31,430
I created a drug cartel.

2863
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:32,150
There's Zetas,

2864
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:32,391
great.

2865
01:22:32,391 --> 01:22:33,224
Use your tax money.

2866
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,130
Um,

2867
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:38,060
so the status where this kind of
a glamorous in inverted commas,

2868
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:42,680
drug gang operating on that part of the
border drug routes move around according

2869
01:22:42,681 --> 01:22:43,461
to where they put policing.

2870
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:44,330
It always gets through,

2871
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:45,290
but it moves around,

2872
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:46,310
they call it the balloon effect.

2873
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:48,530
Imagine a balloon half
full of a push down,

2874
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:48,940
one pace,

2875
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,030
the air comes up somewhere else.

2876
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,340
But at that time it was going through uh,

2877
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:55,270
acquirers and our Paso and Laredo,

2878
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:57,890
Nuevo Laredo and Russell.

2879
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:01,820
Leo says to stories about how raw
Saleo gets involved with the Zetas.

2880
01:23:01,821 --> 01:23:02,840
What Russell Leo says,

2881
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:04,070
he was basically kidnapped by them,

2882
01:23:04,071 --> 01:23:05,830
are forced to start people.

2883
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:07,781
I don't think that's true.

2884
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:08,561
If you look at the evidence,

2885
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:10,720
it's that he sort of volunteered base 13,

2886
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:13,150
so I don't hold him morally
responsible for that.

2887
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:14,680
But either way,

2888
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:16,510
there's one night it all begins.

2889
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:21,310
He's taken on the Mexican side of the
border to a warehouse where they are

2890
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,510
torturing people,

2891
01:23:22,511 --> 01:23:23,680
burning them alive.

2892
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,560
He's given a gun by guy
called Miguel Trevino,

2893
01:23:26,561 --> 01:23:29,650
who later became the head of the Zetas
and he's told to shoot someone in the

2894
01:23:29,651 --> 01:23:29,891
head.

2895
01:23:29,891 --> 01:23:30,970
And that's the moment you're in.

2896
01:23:30,971 --> 01:23:32,140
And when you're in with the Zetas,

2897
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:32,974
you'd never get out,

2898
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:33,400
right.

2899
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,420
No one leaves.

2900
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:35,650
Um,

2901
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:36,550
no one leaves alive.

2902
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,250
And so they begin to train him.

2903
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:43,420
He sent to us in 2005 he sent to a summer
camp that's literally account for the

2904
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:43,691
teachers.

2905
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:48,691
You had to behead people and do all sorts
of things and he's then sent him in in

2906
01:23:49,411 --> 01:23:51,930
his friends are then sent to um,

2907
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,220
murder people is with friends,

2908
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:55,270
Jessie and Gabriel,

2909
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:59,140
they murder huge numbers that they were
called within the Zetas called these

2910
01:23:59,141 --> 01:24:00,880
child soldiers the expendables,

2911
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,740
cause they don't give a
shit if they live or die.

2912
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:03,090
Right.

2913
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:03,340
The,

2914
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:03,921
the,

2915
01:24:03,921 --> 01:24:04,750
the,

2916
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:05,800
this one person said to me,

2917
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:08,170
they prefer children because they
don't understand death so well.

2918
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:08,441
Right.

2919
01:24:08,441 --> 01:24:09,241
Obviously is for solid,

2920
01:24:09,241 --> 01:24:10,074
got a bit older.

2921
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:11,320
He understood death better.

2922
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,940
All his friends get murdered,

2923
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:15,160
eventually tries to get back
to the u s he cooperates.

2924
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:18,190
He now lives in solitary confinement
where he will live by the rest of his life

2925
01:24:18,191 --> 01:24:19,540
because when they let him out of solitary,

2926
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:20,590
shortly before I met him,

2927
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:23,200
he was immediately stabbed in the neck.

2928
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:24,423
Um,

2929
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:26,201
and again,

2930
01:24:26,201 --> 01:24:30,130
you think about this insane
violence that we created,

2931
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:30,281
right?

2932
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:30,920
When I went to Hawaii,

2933
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:31,050
it's,

2934
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:32,170
it's this bizarre thing.

2935
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:33,520
So that time it wasn't,

2936
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,320
you were told it wasn't quite rightly,

2937
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:36,970
it wasn't safe to stay
in horror as overnight.

2938
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:39,940
So I would stay overnight in El Paso
and I'd walk across the bridge right

2939
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:41,770
through three through share passport,

2940
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:44,290
remember the customs people going,

2941
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:45,580
what the fuck are you going into horrors,

2942
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:46,730
but go,

2943
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,740
go in there.

2944
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:48,761
It's weird.

2945
01:24:48,761 --> 01:24:51,430
On on the other side of the bridge,

2946
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:54,820
there's this sign and it says
welcome to historic downtown Juarez.

2947
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,290
And it used to be a tourist site.

2948
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,340
Billie holiday got married there.

2949
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:58,503
But um,

2950
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:03,040
now it's just that time it was just
covered with images of missing women,

2951
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:05,710
just everywhere.

2952
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:08,710
Because this is another really important
part of what this violence doesn't

2953
01:25:08,711 --> 01:25:08,831
think.

2954
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:09,910
It's really important.

2955
01:25:09,911 --> 01:25:14,290
We understand this is the violence caused
by the system that we uphold and we

2956
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:15,220
imposed on Mexico.

2957
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:16,540
Mexicans do not want this.

2958
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:17,170
Right?

2959
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:18,040
So there's another story.

2960
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:20,650
I think there's just of all the stories
I wrote about for chasing the scream

2961
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:22,420
along with one other one I can
tell you about if you want.

2962
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:23,860
This was the hardest.

2963
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,150
So women in horrors.

2964
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:28,030
Um,

2965
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:32,170
when the drug war violence starts to go
through called Maricella Escobedo she

2966
01:25:32,171 --> 01:25:32,530
was a,

2967
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:33,430
a nurse,

2968
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:35,600
but Marissa was incredibly hardworking.

2969
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:37,450
So she also would do these,

2970
01:25:37,451 --> 01:25:37,980
um,

2971
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,760
I would call it like
woodcarvings basically,

2972
01:25:39,761 --> 01:25:41,980
and she would sell them in the
market on Saturdays and Sundays.

2973
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,600
She had three kids.

2974
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,310
Our youngest daughter was called Ruby.

2975
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:49,060
She was 14 at the time and they would
work on this stall in the marketplace.

2976
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:49,660
Um,

2977
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,700
every Saturday I think
they'd been Sundays as well,

2978
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:52,893
some Sundays.

2979
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:58,360
And one day a guy comes up to my
reseller that has store called Sergio.

2980
01:25:58,810 --> 01:25:59,471
He was young guy,

2981
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:00,370
he was like 21.

2982
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:01,630
Um,

2983
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:02,201
and he's like,

2984
01:26:02,201 --> 01:26:02,911
he just had a baby.

2985
01:26:02,911 --> 01:26:03,800
He a job.

2986
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,240
Marcella was kind of soft hearted.

2987
01:26:05,241 --> 01:26:07,490
She gives him a job working
on her market stall.

2988
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:13,250
And a few months later she discovers to
her horror that he's having sex with a

2989
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:13,971
14 year old daughter,

2990
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:14,301
Ruby.

2991
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:14,960
And she's like,

2992
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,630
fires him immediately and it
goes to the police and says,

2993
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:18,920
you need to go and question him.

2994
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:19,131
Right.

2995
01:26:19,131 --> 01:26:19,731
He's 21,

2996
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:20,331
she's 14.

2997
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:21,440
This is a crime.

2998
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:22,760
Police don't do anything.

2999
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:24,170
She doesn't understand it.

3000
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:24,590
What,

3001
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:25,940
why are they not investigating this?

3002
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:30,560
Her daughter starts running
away to be with w with Sergio.

3003
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,013
Um,

3004
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,350
Maricella keeps going to get her back.

3005
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:35,210
She keeps going to the police
saying this is a crime.

3006
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:38,720
Can't live with a 14 year old go and
arrest of they won't do anything.

3007
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:38,941
Right.

3008
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:40,190
She completely puzzled by this.

3009
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,870
Then Ruby gets pregnant.

3010
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,450
Marcel is like fishes 15
by then it's like fuck,

3011
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:45,440
I've got to keep her in my life.

3012
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:46,250
So she,

3013
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,560
she keeps going to see ruby.

3014
01:26:48,561 --> 01:26:51,950
By this time she's kind of accepted the
police on with real rage that police

3015
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:52,870
aren't going to do anything.

3016
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,220
And then one day just
after the baby was born,

3017
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:59,180
she goes to see Ruby and Sergio's
there with the baby and he says,

3018
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:02,030
I'm a ruby has run away with another man.

3019
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:02,780
She's gone.

3020
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:04,040
She's not coming back.

3021
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,350
And varicella is like what?

3022
01:27:06,351 --> 01:27:07,370
And left her baby.

3023
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:07,911
No,

3024
01:27:07,911 --> 01:27:08,481
she hasn't done.

3025
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:09,261
I know she hasn't done that.

3026
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:09,380
No.

3027
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,130
My daughter,

3028
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:10,401
he's like,

3029
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:11,360
well she's gone.

3030
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:13,040
So Mary's cell awaits.

3031
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:13,850
Christmas comes,

3032
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:14,541
no message.

3033
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:15,141
New Year comes,

3034
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:15,974
no message.

3035
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:20,690
She starts to go to the neighborhood and
hand out leaflets with pictures of our

3036
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:21,260
daughter.

3037
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,370
Loads of women are going missing.

3038
01:27:22,371 --> 01:27:23,360
And Horace at this time I,

3039
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:24,194
Taiwan minute,

3040
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:25,670
I'm just saying,

3041
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:26,630
have you seen this go.

3042
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:30,890
And after a few days she gets a call
from a kid called an hale who says,

3043
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:32,840
I'm really frightened
to tell you something.

3044
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:34,010
If you drive me out into the desert,

3045
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:34,844
I'll tell you.

3046
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:36,590
So she drives an hell out into the desert.

3047
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:37,730
He was 14.

3048
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:38,993
Um,

3049
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:39,883
and he says,

3050
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:40,400
um,

3051
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,990
Sergio murdered your daughter.

3052
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:44,180
And he made me help him
dispose of the body.

3053
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:46,280
And he told Maricella where the body was.

3054
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:50,270
It was actually a place where they
dumped a pig carcasses from the AB 12.

3055
01:27:50,271 --> 01:27:52,760
She goes and she finds the body with a son

3056
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:57,290
and she goes to the police and the police
finally do something and they arrest

3057
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:58,124
Sergio.

3058
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,920
Sergio's put on trial in the witness box.

3059
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:01,880
He breaks down,

3060
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:05,000
admits he did it and
apologizes to Maricella.

3061
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:10,100
And then a few weeks later he's
acquitted of all charges and disappears.

3062
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:11,421
And Marisol is like,

3063
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:13,070
what the fuck is going on here?

3064
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,890
So she starts to look into
this and she discovers,

3065
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:19,160
and this is the work intersects with
the drug war and a really important way

3066
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:22,070
that the Sergio was a member of the Zetas.

3067
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,270
Right now,

3068
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:26,630
if you remember the Zetas at that time
in horror as his different acts and other

3069
01:28:26,631 --> 01:28:27,830
drug gangs displaced them,

3070
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:30,020
you own the state,

3071
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:30,880
right?

3072
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:31,713
And you have,

3073
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,830
if they control 70% of the economy,

3074
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,630
you have more money than the government.

3075
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:36,200
Right?

3076
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,040
So the police work.

3077
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,270
Then when I went to go into be Rozalia,

3078
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:39,890
he said when I would go mare to people,

3079
01:28:39,891 --> 01:28:40,670
the police would,

3080
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:41,503
would come with me.

3081
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:42,650
They would dispose of the body.

3082
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:43,250
Right.

3083
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,540
Remember to great.

3084
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:45,740
And what year are we talking about?

3085
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:46,910
This is like six years ago.

3086
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:47,781
I remember the,

3087
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:48,031
the,

3088
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:48,410
the,

3089
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:48,930
the tea.

3090
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:49,640
I'm a bit,

3091
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:49,931
isn't it?

3092
01:28:49,931 --> 01:28:51,650
Because one of the things when
you're in a dangerous place,

3093
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:52,230
when you're,

3094
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,210
when you're in a dangerous place,

3095
01:28:53,211 --> 01:28:56,600
one of the things you do is you read
danger from how frightened the people

3096
01:28:56,601 --> 01:28:57,350
around you are.

3097
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:57,651
Right?

3098
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:59,390
Because you don't know the place I was.

3099
01:28:59,391 --> 01:28:59,601
I mean,

3100
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:01,860
I was there with Julio
and Cardona is my fixer.

3101
01:29:01,861 --> 01:29:02,694
He's an amazing,

3102
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,760
he's the Reuters corresponded choir is
one of the bravest people I've ever met.

3103
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:11,120
But it was realizing how frightened
other people were for me and Julio on,

3104
01:29:11,671 --> 01:29:12,420
right?

3105
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:14,250
And I remember after I'd
been there for a few days,

3106
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:17,830
helion kept introducing me.

3107
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,221
By that time,

3108
01:29:19,221 --> 01:29:22,280
the killings were basically all being
done by the police and it was saying,

3109
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:22,431
you know,

3110
01:29:22,431 --> 01:29:22,680
Julio,

3111
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:23,513
this is,

3112
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:26,420
this is important that I meet people
who've been killed by the police,

3113
01:29:26,421 --> 01:29:28,970
but I should also meet people who've
been killed by the cartels more recently.

3114
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,500
And he said that he just laughed and said,

3115
01:29:30,501 --> 01:29:30,611
no,

3116
01:29:30,611 --> 01:29:30,810
that's,

3117
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:31,631
that's not how it works here.

3118
01:29:31,631 --> 01:29:33,680
I had now if the cartels
want to kill someone,

3119
01:29:33,681 --> 01:29:34,730
they just pay the police to do it,

3120
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,670
right?

3121
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:36,740
So it's this real realization,

3122
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:37,330
all right,

3123
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:38,151
if someone comes to you,

3124
01:29:38,151 --> 01:29:39,680
there is nowhere for you to go,

3125
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:40,460
right?

3126
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:44,990
So Mary refuses to accept that she lives
in a country where there is no justice.

3127
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:46,070
She decides,

3128
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:46,730
okay,

3129
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:47,750
they're not going to solve this.

3130
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:49,190
I'm going to solve this.

3131
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:50,260
She appealed.

3132
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:53,840
Look at loads of women are missing because
it turns out if a bunch of criminals

3133
01:29:53,841 --> 01:29:54,620
control the state,

3134
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:56,270
they will just murder loads
of women and get away with it,

3135
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:56,690
right?

3136
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:58,220
There are some men who
just want to murder women,

3137
01:29:58,221 --> 01:29:59,390
and if they give them license to do it,

3138
01:29:59,391 --> 01:29:59,990
they'll do it.

3139
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:01,550
That's why so many women we're missing.

3140
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:03,770
Maricella gathers a load of those mothers.

3141
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,371
She says,

3142
01:30:04,371 --> 01:30:05,630
some of them don't know
where their daughters are.

3143
01:30:05,631 --> 01:30:06,890
Some of them know their
daughters are dead.

3144
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:07,520
She's like,

3145
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,353
I need your help.

3146
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:11,780
We're going to find this
guy who's done this right?

3147
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:16,760
So Maricella turns herself with
these women into a detective.

3148
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,240
She starts tracking
Sergio all over Mexico,

3149
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,590
wherever there are sightings,

3150
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,420
she walks everywhere.

3151
01:30:23,421 --> 01:30:25,070
She walks over a thousand miles,

3152
01:30:25,071 --> 01:30:25,460
right?

3153
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,600
She walks through the desert.

3154
01:30:26,601 --> 01:30:27,770
It becomes a media phenomenon.

3155
01:30:27,771 --> 01:30:28,670
People follow her.

3156
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,710
She's like this,

3157
01:30:29,710 --> 01:30:34,070
this symbol of the loss that's happened
in Mexico and incredibly with a friend,

3158
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:34,371
Berta,

3159
01:30:34,371 --> 01:30:35,061
Alysia Garcia,

3160
01:30:35,061 --> 01:30:36,080
who I got to know later,

3161
01:30:36,710 --> 01:30:37,640
after two years,

3162
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:39,110
she finds Sergio.

3163
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:40,490
She tracks him down.

3164
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,170
She goes to the police,

3165
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:43,550
she tells them where he is,

3166
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:45,890
they tip him off and he disappears.

3167
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:46,751
I,

3168
01:30:46,751 --> 01:30:47,600
she's devastated.

3169
01:30:47,601 --> 01:30:50,300
So she decided she's going to go to
the governor's mansion in Chihuahua,

3170
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:51,350
uh,

3171
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:52,370
which the state capitol.

3172
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:58,330
She goes there and she sets up 10 outside
the governor's mansion and she's like,

3173
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:02,150
I'm not leaving here until you
people go and find this man.

3174
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:07,900
And she calls on every mother who has a
daughter who's missing or they're afraid

3175
01:31:07,941 --> 01:31:11,090
of four to come and
join her in this fight.

3176
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:12,013
Right?

3177
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:16,760
And it gets to Christmas Eve and she's
preparing to it just before Christmas

3178
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:17,541
isn't Christmas Eve.

3179
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:18,860
I'm going to have this
big Christmas dinner here.

3180
01:31:18,861 --> 01:31:19,790
People can join me.

3181
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:23,360
She gives this great
speech and a man walks up,

3182
01:31:23,361 --> 01:31:25,760
turn sheets are in the head
in front of all the police,

3183
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:26,633
everyone,

3184
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,733
and

3185
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:32,870
to a lot about Maricella.

3186
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:35,680
I got to know her children who live here
in the United States now they've got

3187
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:37,680
a refugee.

3188
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,560
When I think about the
drug war and what it does,

3189
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:43,000
yeah,

3190
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,630
the first person I think I've after
Billie holiday's Marisella Escobedo right.

3191
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:51,370
We have created an enormous amount of
violence that has nothing to do with the

3192
01:31:51,371 --> 01:31:51,641
drug.

3193
01:31:51,641 --> 01:31:52,474
Right?

3194
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,680
Often people will hear this phrase,

3195
01:31:53,681 --> 01:31:58,210
drug related violence and
what they picture when they
hear that is someone using

3196
01:31:58,211 --> 01:31:58,661
drugs,

3197
01:31:58,661 --> 01:32:00,100
losing shit and attacking someone.

3198
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:00,520
Right?

3199
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,760
There's a really good study
by a guy called professor
Paul Goldstein that looked

3200
01:32:03,761 --> 01:32:04,331
at everything.

3201
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:08,560
It was classified as drug related
violence in New York City in 1986 what it

3202
01:32:08,561 --> 01:32:12,400
found was 3% of what's called drug related
violence is someone using drugs and

3203
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:12,971
losing their shit.

3204
01:32:12,971 --> 01:32:13,361
That's real.

3205
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:18,361
It happens sometimes 2% 3% another 7%
was people with an addiction problem like

3206
01:32:19,811 --> 01:32:21,790
committing property crimes and
getting caught or whatever,

3207
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:28,110
and the vast majority was rival drug
gangs and exactly the kind of violence

3208
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:29,350
we're talking about,

3209
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:32,200
the war for drugs created by prohibition.

3210
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:35,560
Now we can reduce the problems
associated with drug use by having,

3211
01:32:35,561 --> 01:32:36,040
these are just,

3212
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:39,850
they have in Switzerland to Portugal and
we can end the violence caused by the

3213
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:40,331
war for drugs.

3214
01:32:40,331 --> 01:32:41,830
There are no violent alcohol gangs.

3215
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:43,660
Al Capone killed loads of people,

3216
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:45,071
drug,

3217
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:48,700
no alcohol seller anywhere in the United
States today will kill a single other

3218
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:49,361
alcohols seller,

3219
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:49,780
right?

3220
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:51,100
That violence ended.

3221
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:52,360
If we banned rice,

3222
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:53,980
there will be violent rice sellers,

3223
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:54,843
right?

3224
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:58,560
We have to understand
that what we are doing,

3225
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,950
and there's this bullshit fucking thing
that said where they'll take these debts

3226
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:03,790
on the supply route,

3227
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:04,480
right?

3228
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,310
Prohibitionists and they'll say,

3229
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:07,061
look at you,

3230
01:33:07,061 --> 01:33:08,410
evil drug users,

3231
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:11,050
your responsible for the
deaths of these people.

3232
01:33:11,051 --> 01:33:11,770
Right?

3233
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:13,800
And to me that is so punishes,

3234
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:14,290
right?

3235
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:18,070
You could have every single drug piece
of druggies that happened in the United

3236
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:20,620
States today and none of those
killings on the supply route.

3237
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:25,720
It is the system those people have
erected and imposed and lied their way to

3238
01:33:25,721 --> 01:33:27,280
maintain the causes,

3239
01:33:27,281 --> 01:33:28,031
this violence.

3240
01:33:28,031 --> 01:33:28,540
Right?

3241
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,220
And we can end this violence.

3242
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,430
And I think about the Rosario,

3243
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:33,010
right?

3244
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:33,270
That,

3245
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:33,670
that,

3246
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:34,450
that,

3247
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:35,283
you know,

3248
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:36,520
I got asked once in an interview,

3249
01:33:36,521 --> 01:33:37,600
who do you feel most sorry for?

3250
01:33:37,601 --> 01:33:38,560
Of all the people you met.

3251
01:33:39,130 --> 01:33:40,990
And obviously I met people with
addiction problems all over the world,

3252
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,480
I think.

3253
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,550
And I surprised myself,

3254
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:45,970
the person who came into
my head was Rozalia because

3255
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,360
we'll have we done to these people.

3256
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:49,980
Right.

3257
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,490
Well it's not we for sure.

3258
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:52,390
Yeah.

3259
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:53,950
As taxpayers we are responsible for it.

3260
01:33:53,951 --> 01:33:54,131
Right?

3261
01:33:54,131 --> 01:33:54,964
I mean we don't,

3262
01:33:55,410 --> 01:33:55,690
you know,

3263
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:57,100
you and I do not support it,

3264
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:58,170
but,

3265
01:33:58,170 --> 01:33:59,003
um,

3266
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:01,030
as a society we,

3267
01:34:01,031 --> 01:34:04,210
we've done that and those of us who were
pose it haven't done a good enough job

3268
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:04,620
of persuading.

3269
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:05,050
When else,

3270
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:05,980
and it goes back to your question,

3271
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:06,791
why does it persist?

3272
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:07,624
Right.

3273
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,980
The key reason I think it's two things.

3274
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:15,040
Partly people are afraid of the
alternatives for understandable reasons.

3275
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:17,230
There are real risks in
pursuing the alternatives.

3276
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,070
Uh,

3277
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:20,200
I think we can understand what
those were signed deal with them,

3278
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:20,831
but that bounce that,

3279
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:24,490
hold on because it seems like those
risks have been mitigated in Portugal and

3280
01:34:24,491 --> 01:34:25,060
Switzerland.

3281
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:29,140
I mean we have real evidence that
those risks and there are unfounded.

3282
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,190
Exactly.

3283
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:32,230
You can understand it's not
crazy to have that fear,

3284
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:34,810
but then we can address that fear by
talking about what actually happened.

3285
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,081
Well,

3286
01:34:35,081 --> 01:34:38,230
why don't we implement some sort
of a small scale version of this.

3287
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:38,411
I mean,

3288
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:40,270
how come no one has ever tried to do this?

3289
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:41,950
You mean do it in Vermont?

3290
01:34:41,951 --> 01:34:45,370
Do it in New Hampshire doing a small
state where there are loads of people who

3291
01:34:45,371 --> 01:34:45,761
want to do that.

3292
01:34:45,761 --> 01:34:47,560
But the federal drug laws are federal,

3293
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,861
right?

3294
01:34:47,861 --> 01:34:49,270
So federal law supersedes,

3295
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:50,100
um,

3296
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:50,350
I'm at,

3297
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,580
that doesn't happen with cannabis.

3298
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:52,600
So that was a,

3299
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,600
that's a big debate technically
and legally the federal
government could go off

3300
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:58,730
this Colorado,

3301
01:34:58,731 --> 01:34:59,540
Washington.

3302
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:03,860
Now there's a political decision to not
do that because cannabis legalization is

3303
01:35:03,861 --> 01:35:06,380
popular in those places
right there where people,

3304
01:35:06,381 --> 01:35:07,820
Jeff sessions when he was the ag one,

3305
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:08,654
it's a general wanting,

3306
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,553
wanting to do that.

3307
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,830
It's just our good luck that actually
he pissed off Trump over something else.

3308
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,350
The cause,

3309
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:17,630
the cause of the meter inquiring
everything that Trump kind of,

3310
01:35:17,631 --> 01:35:19,130
despite Jeff sessions didn't line.

3311
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,910
So the federal banking
laws actually mean that,

3312
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:23,530
you know,

3313
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:26,180
cannabis stores are operating
in this weird gray area.

3314
01:35:26,181 --> 01:35:27,170
They can't have bank account.

3315
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:27,801
My point is,

3316
01:35:27,801 --> 01:35:29,510
why is no one pushing this?

3317
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:29,721
Why?

3318
01:35:29,721 --> 01:35:31,310
Why is the world people are pushing that?

3319
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:32,810
Yeah.

3320
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:35,120
So I think there are lots of
people who are pushing this.

3321
01:35:35,121 --> 01:35:39,140
The amazing groups urge everyone to join
and support the drug policy alliance on

3322
01:35:39,141 --> 01:35:39,280
the,

3323
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,020
what I'm saying is why are no
politician's ever discussing this?

3324
01:35:42,021 --> 01:35:44,420
This is never an option because those are
the only ones that are going to really

3325
01:35:44,421 --> 01:35:45,254
change policy.

3326
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:49,700
So we're seeing a big change in public
opinion that is changed on many issues.

3327
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:52,340
So think about when Bill
Clinton stopped being president,

3328
01:35:52,341 --> 01:35:52,730
which is,

3329
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:53,061
you know,

3330
01:35:53,061 --> 01:35:54,320
we remember there's not that long ago,

3331
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:58,250
16% of Americans supported
legalizing cannabis.

3332
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:01,700
Today 70% of Americans
support legalizing cannabis.

3333
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:04,220
So extraordinary transformation,

3334
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,780
a very short period of time,

3335
01:36:05,781 --> 01:36:05,990
right?

3336
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:10,370
Likely brought on by the fact that the
medical use of it was prohibited up until

3337
01:36:10,371 --> 01:36:10,880
then.

3338
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,940
I mean it was like 1994
right when it was passed.

3339
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:18,860
And then California has started doing
it and then you started having positive

3340
01:36:18,861 --> 01:36:22,190
tax revenues from it and you started
seeing people that were suffering from a

3341
01:36:22,191 --> 01:36:26,930
lot of ailments showing that they
were helped substantially by cannabis.

3342
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:29,240
And then the attitude of it
changed in popular culture.

3343
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:30,190
It changed.

3344
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:31,023
I mean the,

3345
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,900
what's so crazy is that
that reefer madness,

3346
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:33,690
reaper,

3347
01:36:33,690 --> 01:36:35,940
reefer madness proposition or the,

3348
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:36,340
uh,

3349
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:36,710
um,

3350
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:41,090
propaganda rather was so effective that
they did it in the 1930s and it carried

3351
01:36:41,091 --> 01:36:43,220
on into the 90s into the two thousands.

3352
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:45,710
There's still people alive
today to believe some of that.

3353
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:47,630
I think you put that really well.

3354
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,490
I think as a series of things going on,

3355
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:51,080
partly what happened,

3356
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:54,260
one of the major,

3357
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:59,720
one of the major factors that make it
possible for the drug war to continue is

3358
01:36:59,721 --> 01:37:02,000
the dehumanization of
people at every turn.

3359
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:02,680
Right?

3360
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,610
Got The dehumanization of drug users.

3361
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:08,300
And it's funny we should talk
about use as opposed to addiction,

3362
01:37:08,301 --> 01:37:09,134
but um,

3363
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:11,120
dehumanization of drug users,

3364
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:13,130
dehumanization of people
with addiction problems,

3365
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:14,870
dehumanization of drug dealers.

3366
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,240
There's a reason why one of the most
sympathetic people in my book is a

3367
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:19,310
transgendered crack dealer
called Chino Harden.

3368
01:37:19,311 --> 01:37:23,300
He's an amazing human
being and dehumanization of
people on the supply route

3369
01:37:23,301 --> 01:37:23,751
countries.

3370
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:26,510
You're hearing the way people are talking
about Mexicans now of powerful people

3371
01:37:26,511 --> 01:37:27,344
in this society.

3372
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,210
And one of the reasons why chasing the
scream is written as stories of people

3373
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,890
is because the solution to
dehumanization is to re humanization.

3374
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,230
When I was meeting these
people all over the world,

3375
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:40,730
I kept thinking

3376
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:46,610
if any ordinary American could
meet Chino harder and my friend,

3377
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:49,310
that transgender crack dealer
who is hilarious and amazing,

3378
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,290
if they could meet Bud Osborne,

3379
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:53,840
the homeless street addict who
started a movement in Canada,

3380
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:55,050
um,

3381
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:56,580
if they could meet Maricella,

3382
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:59,700
they would not say that the deaths
of these people mean nothing,

3383
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:00,270
right?

3384
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:01,200
They would not say,

3385
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:01,471
yeah,

3386
01:38:01,471 --> 01:38:04,890
let's pursue a policy that kills them
cause we get some imaginary benefit

3387
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:05,760
further down the line.

3388
01:38:05,761 --> 01:38:05,941
Right?

3389
01:38:05,941 --> 01:38:06,730
Think about Lee Maddix,

3390
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:07,563
the cop in Baltimore.

3391
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:08,640
It was when Ed died.

3392
01:38:08,641 --> 01:38:09,670
It was when her partner does Sheila,

3393
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,370
what are we losing these people for?

3394
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:15,720
It's that moment or getting people
to see everyone involved as human,

3395
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:16,380
right?

3396
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,370
We're not there yet.

3397
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:20,460
Still the ways people are
talking about addiction are,

3398
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,713
oh,

3399
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:24,213
repellent,

3400
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:24,640
right?

3401
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,410
This is the thing of people as being weak.

3402
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:29,530
I think of people's having poor willpower,

3403
01:38:29,531 --> 01:38:30,460
poor character,

3404
01:38:30,461 --> 01:38:31,630
and that's why they're addicted.

3405
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,640
They're most people.

3406
01:38:33,641 --> 01:38:34,000
I would,

3407
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,640
I would say it's safe to venture,

3408
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:40,180
aren't really fully
aware of what the causes,

3409
01:38:40,181 --> 01:38:43,300
what the underlying causes of people
becoming addicted to drugs in the first

3410
01:38:43,301 --> 01:38:44,200
place are and what,

3411
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:46,330
what leads people this
great sense of despair.

3412
01:38:46,331 --> 01:38:49,420
I mean it's really about
reengineering our entire culture.

3413
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:52,420
I mean reengineering not just
the way we treat addiction,

3414
01:38:52,421 --> 01:38:55,210
but the way we treat human beings
where we treat poor neighborhoods.

3415
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:56,613
I mean there's,

3416
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:02,340
there's so much that needs to be done
that's never dressed totally right.

3417
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:05,090
And this one part of this,

3418
01:39:05,091 --> 01:39:06,310
this a funny

3419
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:11,910
really one of the surprises me in this
debate I have found is actually easier in

3420
01:39:11,911 --> 01:39:16,911
the u s to make the case for compassion
for people with addiction problems than

3421
01:39:17,281 --> 01:39:20,370
to make the case for liberty for
drug users who are not addicted.

3422
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:20,850
Right.

3423
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:21,690
So like we were saying,

3424
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,220
even the main drug war body in the world,

3425
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:24,240
the UN ODC,

3426
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:28,200
you're an office of drug control admits
90% of all currently banned drug uses.

3427
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,520
What's called non problematic,

3428
01:39:29,521 --> 01:39:30,060
right?

3429
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:30,511
Our friend,

3430
01:39:30,511 --> 01:39:33,690
professor call heart is the head of
psychology at Columbia University and an

3431
01:39:33,691 --> 01:39:37,560
extraordinary human being has done
really important work explaining this to

3432
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:38,394
people,

3433
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:42,300
even with what we think of as the
devil drugs like heroin crack.

3434
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:46,050
The vast majority of people who use
heroin and crack do not become addicted.

3435
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:46,530
Right.

3436
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:49,290
Which I found really chat when
Carl first explain that to me.

3437
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:50,280
I was like,

3438
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,480
what's this guy talking about?

3439
01:39:51,481 --> 01:39:54,510
And then we looked at the
scientific evidence that
there is very clear evidence.

3440
01:39:54,511 --> 01:39:55,270
Right?

3441
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:55,610
Um,

3442
01:39:55,610 --> 01:39:55,810
the,

3443
01:39:55,810 --> 01:40:00,810
the actually the ratio of people who use
any drug he become addicted is pretty

3444
01:40:01,141 --> 01:40:02,700
consistently 10 to 20%.

3445
01:40:02,701 --> 01:40:02,910
Right?

3446
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:04,710
Slightly higher for things like heroin,

3447
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,930
but it's pretty consistently in that zone.

3448
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,710
Right?

3449
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,270
Which is not to say that
there aren't other ha,

3450
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,650
heroin depresses your breathing.

3451
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:11,580
It can cause death that way.

3452
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:12,720
The other harms,

3453
01:40:12,721 --> 01:40:13,620
but which we might addiction.

3454
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:14,483
Right.

3455
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,353
Um,

3456
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:16,463
so

3457
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:18,890
it's interesting.

3458
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:22,760
There's so much I think we
need to explain to people.

3459
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:24,200
One person here in La,

3460
01:40:24,201 --> 01:40:26,540
you really helped me to understand
this and the research for the book.

3461
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:28,220
Biggest guy called
Professor Ronald Casey goal.

3462
01:40:28,221 --> 01:40:28,640
You should.

3463
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,720
You should totally have in your shows.

3464
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:30,710
A very interesting guy.

3465
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:32,570
He was an advisor to
four American presidents.

3466
01:40:32,571 --> 01:40:32,900
He was a,

3467
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,040
who buys it?

3468
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,000
World Health Organization,

3469
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,350
really serious scientists,

3470
01:40:36,351 --> 01:40:38,000
but he had a sideline for 30 years.

3471
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:40,550
We investigated animals using drugs,

3472
01:40:40,551 --> 01:40:41,360
right,

3473
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:46,310
and he's basically shown loads of
species love getting intoxicated for the

3474
01:40:46,311 --> 01:40:46,851
pleasure of it.

3475
01:40:46,851 --> 01:40:48,110
Right out elephants.

3476
01:40:48,350 --> 01:40:50,320
Elephants like this is the
amazing sample given bank.

3477
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:54,040
All of elephants who broke into an
alcohol store got drunk and just fucked up

3478
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:54,874
the whole village.

3479
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:57,220
If you give,

3480
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,050
if you give hash to mice,

3481
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,740
what they do is they'll,

3482
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,080
they get really horny.

3483
01:41:02,081 --> 01:41:03,510
They tried to mail most,

3484
01:41:03,511 --> 01:41:04,630
we'll try to mount women,

3485
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,730
but then they basically can't get up,

3486
01:41:06,731 --> 01:41:09,970
so they just spend hours looking their
own balls and they're going to cock semi

3487
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:10,843
loads of examples.

3488
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,610
It's about a guy press a seagull.

3489
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:17,410
I remember he told me at one point that
he'd spent three years investigating

3490
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:24,480
grasshoppers in cannabis fields who just
naturally live in cannabis fields to

3491
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:25,990
figure out when they eat the cannabis,

3492
01:41:25,991 --> 01:41:27,310
do they jump higher or lower?

3493
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:28,301
And I said,

3494
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:29,620
I write and at the end
of your three years,

3495
01:41:29,621 --> 01:41:30,490
what did you discover?

3496
01:41:30,491 --> 01:41:30,851
And he said,

3497
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:32,820
they'd turns out they just jump
the same height as everyone,

3498
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,580
all the other girls.

3499
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:36,070
So it wasn't a great use of
your three years of life.

3500
01:41:36,071 --> 01:41:36,970
But he also got the,

3501
01:41:36,971 --> 01:41:38,820
at an interesting time
when he was in Hawaii,

3502
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:42,970
he was investigating mongoose where
the mongoose is like hallucinogens,

3503
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,640
psychedelics and he,

3504
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:50,750
so he's like spying on these mongooses
with binoculars and he gets caught and he

3505
01:41:51,911 --> 01:41:54,680
gets caught by a load of
drug traffickers and like,

3506
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,390
who the fuck are you?

3507
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:55,730
And he's like,

3508
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:56,563
don't worry.

3509
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:58,960
I'm just investigating with a
mongoose is like psychedelics.

3510
01:41:58,961 --> 01:42:01,630
Like that is the worst fucking cupboard
story we've ever had that held them

3511
01:42:01,631 --> 01:42:02,560
hostage for like two days.

3512
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,160
But what he showed is something I think
is really important and there's loads of

3513
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:07,150
other evidence for which is,

3514
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:08,593
um,

3515
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:12,400
it is absolutely a Nate to other species,

3516
01:42:12,401 --> 01:42:13,870
but especially to humans,

3517
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:15,940
the desire to get intoxicated,

3518
01:42:15,941 --> 01:42:16,420
right.

3519
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:19,480
There has never been a human society
anywhere in the world where people didn't

3520
01:42:19,481 --> 01:42:21,670
seek out and toxicants
and enjoy using them.

3521
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:25,870
The only society where there were no
naturally occurring and toxicants was the

3522
01:42:25,871 --> 01:42:26,250
internet,

3523
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:29,470
the what we used to be called the Eskimos
in the Arctic and they used to just

3524
01:42:29,471 --> 01:42:33,430
starve themselves to get a fucked up head
state because that's how deep it is in

3525
01:42:33,431 --> 01:42:34,090
human beings.

3526
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:35,560
If there is nothing in the star,

3527
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,180
if you starve yourself long enough,

3528
01:42:37,181 --> 01:42:39,460
you get a kind of fucked
up head state basically.

3529
01:42:39,550 --> 01:42:40,210
How far,

3530
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:41,260
how long are you going to go for?

3531
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,160
I don't know.

3532
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:44,290
I looked into the details of
it but he writes about that.

3533
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:45,260
Um,

3534
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:46,810
but but so it's fasting.

3535
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:47,741
Yeah.

3536
01:42:47,741 --> 01:42:49,120
Fasting causes and ultra Ted state.

3537
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:49,954
But the,

3538
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,180
I've never done it but this,

3539
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:52,780
this,

3540
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:56,320
this intoxication in is deep and
human beings as the sexual impasse,

3541
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:57,850
you even see it in small children.

3542
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:58,301
You know,

3543
01:42:58,301 --> 01:42:58,811
when little kid,

3544
01:42:58,811 --> 01:43:01,060
everyone will remember this memory of
when you're a little kid and you realize

3545
01:43:01,061 --> 01:43:04,090
you can spin round and round and round
even though you know it will make you

3546
01:43:04,091 --> 01:43:04,391
sick,

3547
01:43:04,391 --> 01:43:06,190
you'd do it cause you
get an altered headspace.

3548
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:11,460
That is one of the first expressions of
the kind of intoxication impulse or a

3549
01:43:12,281 --> 01:43:14,950
really nice example is for 2000 years,

3550
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:18,940
a 40 miles outside of
Athens in ancient Greece,

3551
01:43:18,941 --> 01:43:22,390
they used to be once a year
people would meet at something,

3552
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:26,350
a place called the temple of elusiveness
and it was basically burning man.

3553
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,360
They would all use a psychedelic together.

3554
01:43:28,361 --> 01:43:30,010
We now know what that target bellicose,

3555
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:30,701
yeah,

3556
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:31,360
it was a kind of,

3557
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,560
there's lots of different theories,

3558
01:43:32,561 --> 01:43:34,480
but they think it was a
kind of fungus basically.

3559
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:35,370
Um,

3560
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:36,310
I got rid of the name of it,

3561
01:43:36,311 --> 01:43:39,200
but there's been some researchers
and Simon or something.

3562
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:40,710
I don't know,

3563
01:43:40,710 --> 01:43:41,050
I,

3564
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:41,831
I want to say it wrong.

3565
01:43:41,831 --> 01:43:41,921
I,

3566
01:43:41,921 --> 01:43:42,581
there was some kind of stuff,

3567
01:43:42,581 --> 01:43:46,510
I'm kind of stuff and like people
like Plato and Eric Sanders,

3568
01:43:46,511 --> 01:43:46,871
people say,

3569
01:43:46,871 --> 01:43:47,091
you know,

3570
01:43:47,091 --> 01:43:48,970
drugs or William Bennett,

3571
01:43:48,971 --> 01:43:52,610
the former drugs are saying drugs are
an attack on the foundations of Western

3572
01:43:52,611 --> 01:43:53,241
civilization.

3573
01:43:53,241 --> 01:43:53,481
Or you're like,

3574
01:43:53,481 --> 01:43:54,260
no.

3575
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:58,190
At the actual foundations
of Western civilization that
people your holding up as

3576
01:43:58,191 --> 01:43:58,731
the icons,

3577
01:43:58,731 --> 01:44:02,180
like Plato and Aristotle were literally
getting fucked up in exactly the way you

3578
01:44:02,181 --> 01:44:03,140
say as an attack on them,

3579
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:03,790
right?

3580
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:05,000
It's this deep misunderstanding.

3581
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:07,520
So this is a natural human impulse.

3582
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:08,870
We are never going to get rid of it.

3583
01:44:08,871 --> 01:44:09,800
We want to get rid of it.

3584
01:44:09,801 --> 01:44:11,360
It gives people a lot of joy and pleasure.

3585
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:14,900
And yet the Oscar Wilde said once,

3586
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:16,000
I'm going to get the quote slightly wrong,

3587
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:16,731
said it better than this,

3588
01:44:16,731 --> 01:44:17,390
but he said,

3589
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:22,130
puritanism is the deep gnawing fear
that someone somewhere is enjoying

3590
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:22,964
themselves.

3591
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:26,470
And there's this puritanical hatred of,

3592
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:27,281
of drug east,

3593
01:44:27,281 --> 01:44:28,030
right?

3594
01:44:28,030 --> 01:44:28,700
Um,

3595
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,310
now some of that is understandable fears,

3596
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,610
Matt genuine harms.

3597
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:32,420
Uh,

3598
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:33,710
and that's a different thing,

3599
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,050
but a lot of it is just very deep.

3600
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:39,770
Puritanism and you've really
seen it in one phrase.

3601
01:44:39,771 --> 01:44:40,550
We need to get,

3602
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:42,890
get out of the English language
is the ridiculous phrase.

3603
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:44,240
Drugs and alcohol.

3604
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,520
It's like saying fruit and apples.

3605
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:48,230
Alcohol is a drug,

3606
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:48,680
right?

3607
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:51,860
I'll call is easily the
deadliest drug in our culture.

3608
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:52,670
Uh,

3609
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:53,720
well after tobacco.

3610
01:44:54,170 --> 01:44:55,003
Um,

3611
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:55,281
it's,

3612
01:44:55,281 --> 01:44:55,341
uh,

3613
01:44:55,341 --> 01:44:55,580
not,

3614
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:56,121
it's like saying,

3615
01:44:56,121 --> 01:44:56,700
you know,

3616
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:59,750
as my friend Steve Rolls his big campaign
on this is it's like saying metal and

3617
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:00,350
iron,

3618
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:00,890
right?

3619
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:02,210
It's a meaningless phrase,

3620
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:02,661
but it's,

3621
01:45:02,661 --> 01:45:02,950
you,

3622
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:05,420
there's this distinction between
an alcohol and other drugs.

3623
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:06,590
Is,

3624
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:08,540
is a way of maintaining this drug war,

3625
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:09,080
right?

3626
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:12,500
Because the reality is the same proportion
of people become addicted to alcohol

3627
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:13,820
has become addicted to cocaine,

3628
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:14,510
right?

3629
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:15,261
Same proportion.

3630
01:45:15,261 --> 01:45:15,510
Not Saying,

3631
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:16,710
not absolute numbers can up.

3632
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:17,563
We use our call.

3633
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:18,483
Um,

3634
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:21,630
risks from alcohol are
very similar to restroom,

3635
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:22,191
other drugs,

3636
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:22,341
right?

3637
01:45:22,341 --> 01:45:22,850
Actually,

3638
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:26,630
some of them are alcohol is significantly
more dangerous than some drugs that

3639
01:45:26,631 --> 01:45:27,650
are currently banned.

3640
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:28,843
Um,

3641
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:31,550
but we with alcohol,

3642
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:34,580
and it comes back to what you're saying
about why we don't change these policies

3643
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:35,810
without alcohol.

3644
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:37,130
Enough people.

3645
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:37,370
Well,

3646
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:38,870
everyone knows people who drink alcohol,

3647
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:39,410
right?

3648
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:42,560
And one of the reasons things changed
on cannabis is because more people came

3649
01:45:42,561 --> 01:45:43,490
out and talked about it.

3650
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:47,390
And so you had this situation where
you've got Harry Anslinger saying,

3651
01:45:47,391 --> 01:45:48,950
if you use cannabis,

3652
01:45:48,951 --> 01:45:49,580
you'll,

3653
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:50,091
you know,

3654
01:45:50,091 --> 01:45:51,410
kill your family with an axe.

3655
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:55,100
By the time we get to the nineties enough
people know enough people have used

3656
01:45:55,101 --> 01:45:55,600
cannabis to go,

3657
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:55,761
right.

3658
01:45:55,761 --> 01:45:59,490
Well Jimmy over there ain't a hot jacket
chopping his family to death with an

3659
01:45:59,491 --> 01:45:59,871
ax.

3660
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:00,410
Right?

3661
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:00,741
This is,

3662
01:46:00,741 --> 01:46:01,574
this is bullshit.

3663
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:04,700
And I think one of the things we have
to do is encourage people to talk.

3664
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:09,470
One of the weird things is the
prohibition creates a distorted picture of

3665
01:46:09,471 --> 01:46:10,880
overall drug use,

3666
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:11,630
right?

3667
01:46:11,630 --> 01:46:14,270
Because loads of your listeners
might say on Facebook,

3668
01:46:14,271 --> 01:46:14,541
you know,

3669
01:46:14,541 --> 01:46:16,970
I went out on Saturday
night and I had you know,

3670
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:21,080
five vodka shots and I got
hammered and had a great time.

3671
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:23,120
You'd be pretty foolish
if you put on Facebook,

3672
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:23,500
Oh,

3673
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:26,210
a Saturday night I went out and have five
lines of coke and I had a great night.

3674
01:46:26,211 --> 01:46:26,451
Right?

3675
01:46:26,451 --> 01:46:27,121
You would be a fall.

3676
01:46:27,121 --> 01:46:28,400
And a lot of people I fall.

3677
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:30,141
Let me ask you this,

3678
01:46:30,141 --> 01:46:34,760
is there a culture where there's no
demonized use of drugs or alcohol?

3679
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:39,760
Is there any culture that doesn't frown
upon some drugs or have some forbidden

3680
01:46:40,611 --> 01:46:41,690
categories for drugs?

3681
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,440
What they'd been those
societies throughout history,

3682
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:45,651
right?

3683
01:46:45,651 --> 01:46:46,670
I mean now,

3684
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:47,783
well,

3685
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,300
we've got to understand it in the of the
war that Harry Anslinger imposed upon

3686
01:46:51,301 --> 01:46:51,841
the whole world,

3687
01:46:51,841 --> 01:46:52,380
right?

3688
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:53,730
There was no country.

3689
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:54,301
I mean,

3690
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:55,650
if you think about habits of Mexico,

3691
01:46:55,651 --> 01:46:56,220
right?

3692
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:57,660
So Mexico had,

3693
01:46:57,690 --> 01:46:58,020
uh,

3694
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:01,230
so the 1930s Anslinger
says to the Mexicans,

3695
01:47:01,231 --> 01:47:02,390
you'll notice some real parallels.

3696
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:03,243
What's happening now.

3697
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,430
You guys are responsible
for our drug epidemic.

3698
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:07,890
You've got to band drugs and
have a vicious war on drugs,

3699
01:47:07,891 --> 01:47:08,640
right?

3700
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,620
And the Mexican government alike.

3701
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:11,723
No,

3702
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,650
we can see the policies
don't work for you.

3703
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:14,820
We're not going to do it.

3704
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,140
They had a drug saw,

3705
01:47:16,141 --> 01:47:18,030
a drug minister called Leopoldo Salazar.

3706
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:18,541
Viagra.

3707
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:19,710
They should build fucking statues.

3708
01:47:19,711 --> 01:47:19,891
Do.

3709
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:21,270
No Man has ever been more prescient.

3710
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:22,980
He explained to the Americans,

3711
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:23,930
we don't wanna Bang,

3712
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:26,190
cannabis is not particularly
harmful with other drugs.

3713
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,080
We should be writing people
with compassionate care.

3714
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:29,580
And if we banned drugs,

3715
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:30,450
the countries get,

3716
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:32,460
our country's going to be
taken over by drug lords.

3717
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:32,761
Right?

3718
01:47:32,761 --> 01:47:34,770
No one has ever been more
right about anything.

3719
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,053
Um,

3720
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:37,500
the Americans,

3721
01:47:37,501 --> 01:47:38,390
the u s stock,

3722
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:39,243
um,

3723
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,800
pressuring Mexico more and more.

3724
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:42,120
In the end,

3725
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:43,920
they cut off.

3726
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:48,330
So all opiates for pain relief used
in hospitals were manufactured in the

3727
01:47:48,331 --> 01:47:50,040
Americans in the United
States at that time.

3728
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:51,690
They cut off the supply,

3729
01:47:51,691 --> 01:47:52,524
all of them.

3730
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:54,960
People start dying in hospitals,

3731
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:58,230
all of Mexico and agony
and the Mexicans given,

3732
01:47:58,231 --> 01:48:01,200
they fired this guy and they begin the
drug war and the whole journey that leads

3733
01:48:01,201 --> 01:48:01,511
to Ross,

3734
01:48:01,511 --> 01:48:02,160
Salvia Hereto,

3735
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,350
the guy and I from the
Zetas and Marcel is death.

3736
01:48:04,351 --> 01:48:06,060
That that trajectory begins at that point,

3737
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:08,520
and this is something we haven't
explained it I think is so important,

3738
01:48:08,521 --> 01:48:09,354
right?

3739
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:13,680
Actually really surprised me learning
about the history of all this stuff at the

3740
01:48:13,681 --> 01:48:14,790
birth of the drug war,

3741
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,250
it was intensely resisted,

3742
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:17,670
right?

3743
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:18,750
I think about here in La,

3744
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:19,470
right?

3745
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:20,181
In Los Angeles,

3746
01:48:20,181 --> 01:48:21,900
it was a doctor called
Henry Smith Williams.

3747
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:23,700
When heroin was band,

3748
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:26,730
there was a deliberate
loophole in the law that said,

3749
01:48:26,731 --> 01:48:26,941
okay,

3750
01:48:26,941 --> 01:48:27,930
you can't sell heroin,

3751
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:30,360
but doctors can prescribe it to
people with addiction problems.

3752
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:31,860
Just like what happened in Switzerland,

3753
01:48:31,861 --> 01:48:32,310
right?

3754
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:33,200
So here in La,

3755
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:36,360
big heroin clinic prescribed Anslinger.

3756
01:48:36,361 --> 01:48:37,320
It drives him crazy.

3757
01:48:37,321 --> 01:48:38,340
He wants to shut it down.

3758
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:42,330
So the mayor of Los Angeles stands in
front of this heroin prescription clinic

3759
01:48:42,331 --> 01:48:42,750
and says,

3760
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,100
you will not shut this down.

3761
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:45,030
This does a good job for us.

3762
01:48:45,031 --> 01:48:46,200
But answering shuts it down.

3763
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,230
When the doctors say to the,

3764
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,790
there's the biggest crackdown
on doctors in American history,

3765
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:53,520
over 12,000 doctors are
arrested and rounded up.

3766
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,690
Um,

3767
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:56,370
when they come to the one in Portland,

3768
01:48:56,371 --> 01:48:57,204
Oregon,

3769
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:57,871
the doctors say,

3770
01:48:57,871 --> 01:49:00,720
but what are we meant to do with all
these vulnerable addictive people?

3771
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:02,730
And one of the agents that
go and throw them in the leg,

3772
01:49:02,731 --> 01:49:03,870
they'll make good fish food.

3773
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,201
Right?

3774
01:49:04,201 --> 01:49:05,160
That was the attitude.

3775
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,473
Um,

3776
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:09,750
so this is resisted intensely
at the birth of the drug war.

3777
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:13,740
So you had a society really recently
that had a much more mature,

3778
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:17,430
exactly what you're asking about a much
more mature attitude to drug use than we

3779
01:49:17,431 --> 01:49:17,881
have now.

3780
01:49:17,881 --> 01:49:18,540
Right?

3781
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:20,880
It's not that people thought
all drug use is good.

3782
01:49:20,881 --> 01:49:22,560
We should celebrate every
instance of drug use.

3783
01:49:22,561 --> 01:49:23,371
No one thinks that.

3784
01:49:23,371 --> 01:49:23,940
Right?

3785
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:25,510
They were problems and there were,

3786
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,870
there is some joy
associated with drug use.

3787
01:49:27,871 --> 01:49:28,800
That's actually the norm.

3788
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:32,820
There is some pain and terrible
things associated with drug use,

3789
01:49:32,821 --> 01:49:34,920
which are mostly driven
by underlying harm,

3790
01:49:34,921 --> 01:49:35,940
but there are real homes,

3791
01:49:36,150 --> 01:49:37,470
the come from some drugs as well.

3792
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:38,873
Um,

3793
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:42,930
and most societies until very recently
had a mature appreciation of this,

3794
01:49:42,931 --> 01:49:43,530
right?

3795
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:43,920
Really,

3796
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:48,580
we are the outlier that most
societies have had licensed

3797
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:49,530
in toxicants.

3798
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:50,380
Um,

3799
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:52,770
now of course in different
societies at different Tyler was,

3800
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,910
I was the czar of Russia
who wanted to ban tobacco,

3801
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:55,181
right?

3802
01:49:55,181 --> 01:49:58,330
And did terrible things to anyone
who was found with tobacco.

3803
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:01,360
Different societies have had
different panics at different times,

3804
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:02,643
but

3805
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:06,360
we are the historical outliers,

3806
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:07,080
right?

3807
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:07,913
I mean,

3808
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,040
to give you a sense of just
the United States in prisons,

3809
01:50:11,041 --> 01:50:11,910
2 million people,

3810
01:50:11,911 --> 01:50:16,020
that has never been a society that
imprisons this many of its citizens,

3811
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:19,170
this higher proportion of
its citizens anywhere ever.

3812
01:50:19,171 --> 01:50:20,820
It's overwhelmingly
driven by the drug war,

3813
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:21,360
right?

3814
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,170
I mean the u s in prison,

3815
01:50:23,171 --> 01:50:27,060
so many people and the conditions in
those prisons are so terrible that the

3816
01:50:27,061 --> 01:50:30,960
United States is almost certainly the
first society ever were more men had been

3817
01:50:30,961 --> 01:50:31,201
raped.

3818
01:50:31,201 --> 01:50:34,080
The women pass how extreme this,

3819
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:35,280
this war is,

3820
01:50:35,281 --> 01:50:36,090
right?

3821
01:50:36,090 --> 01:50:38,250
And what we do to people in what this,

3822
01:50:38,251 --> 01:50:38,750
what this,

3823
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:39,220
the,

3824
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:39,810
the,

3825
01:50:39,810 --> 01:50:40,621
the conditions.

3826
01:50:40,621 --> 01:50:42,290
This war creates it

3827
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:47,230
and it's a total historical outlier.

3828
01:50:47,231 --> 01:50:48,940
We are in a freak experiment.

3829
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:49,540
Right?

3830
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:51,910
And the one thing you can say
in defense of the drug war,

3831
01:50:51,911 --> 01:50:53,800
and I would give one
bit of credit for this,

3832
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:55,930
is we gave it a fair shot,

3833
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:56,740
right?

3834
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:58,690
The United States has done
it for a hundred years.

3835
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:01,900
This country has spent $1 trillion on it.

3836
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:02,710
Uh,

3837
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:05,620
we've imprisoned millions
of our own citizens.

3838
01:51:05,621 --> 01:51:06,050
We've,

3839
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:09,190
we killed hundreds of thousands of
people that are conservative estimate.

3840
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,660
We've destroyed whole countries.

3841
01:51:10,661 --> 01:51:14,350
Like Colombia isn't the problem now that
there's a gigantic business behind it

3842
01:51:14,351 --> 01:51:17,470
all from private prisons
to prison guard unions,

3843
01:51:17,471 --> 01:51:20,950
to the pharmaceutical industry that
would benefit from keeping most of these

3844
01:51:20,951 --> 01:51:22,330
drugs illegal.

3845
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:26,350
So their profits continue
to rise to law enforcement.

3846
01:51:26,351 --> 01:51:26,651
I mean,

3847
01:51:26,651 --> 01:51:27,890
down the line it's,

3848
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:31,570
you'd be disrupting like an evil industry,

3849
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:32,440
but an industry,

3850
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:34,300
I think that's a real factor,

3851
01:51:34,301 --> 01:51:35,710
but I don't want to overstate it.

3852
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:38,170
Lots of policies have best in each factor.

3853
01:51:38,171 --> 01:51:39,520
What's the main factor?

3854
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:41,260
The main factor is

3855
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:43,880
most people are asked,

3856
01:51:43,881 --> 01:51:45,260
do you think the drug war has failed?

3857
01:51:45,261 --> 01:51:46,094
So yes.

3858
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:47,120
And most people ask,

3859
01:51:47,121 --> 01:51:49,100
do you want to legalize any
drug other than cannabis?

3860
01:51:49,101 --> 01:51:49,581
Say No.

3861
01:51:49,581 --> 01:51:50,091
Very strong.

3862
01:51:50,091 --> 01:51:51,080
So education,

3863
01:51:51,410 --> 01:51:52,280
I think it's about,

3864
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:55,940
we use the word education can give you
an example of a specific person who I

3865
01:51:55,941 --> 01:51:57,320
think showed a way to do this.

3866
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:58,933
Um,

3867
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:01,670
so in the year 2000 in Vancouver,

3868
01:52:01,671 --> 01:52:05,240
there was a homeless street addict
called bottles bomb and he lived in a

3869
01:52:05,241 --> 01:52:07,700
notorious part of Vancouver
called the downtown east side.

3870
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:08,480
It,

3871
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:08,900
um,

3872
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:10,550
people in Vancouver Pippins Franco Nero.

3873
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:10,900
No,

3874
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:13,650
it's a place particular
at that time that had um,

3875
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:14,720
really high,

3876
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:16,460
like nightmarish opened drug scene.

3877
01:52:16,461 --> 01:52:16,800
Rogers,

3878
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,091
again,

3879
01:52:17,091 --> 01:52:18,050
people it like in Switzerland,

3880
01:52:18,051 --> 01:52:19,100
people injecting in the streets,

3881
01:52:19,101 --> 01:52:19,934
that kind of thing.

3882
01:52:20,930 --> 01:52:24,800
And Bod was living homeless and he was
watching his friends die all around him.

3883
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:29,840
At that time there was a
really big police crackdown.

3884
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:31,190
Um,

3885
01:52:31,190 --> 01:52:35,630
and so people would go and like hide and
dumpsters or in alleyways to shoot up.

3886
01:52:35,631 --> 01:52:37,550
But obviously if you're
hiding and you overdose,

3887
01:52:37,551 --> 01:52:38,121
no one sees it,

3888
01:52:38,121 --> 01:52:38,600
you just die.

3889
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:39,433
Right.

3890
01:52:39,470 --> 01:52:40,303
And one day bud,

3891
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:41,570
um,

3892
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:44,030
he learns at one of his
friends Judith had had died.

3893
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:45,620
And like,

3894
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,700
I can't just sit here and wait for
my friends to tie them for me to die.

3895
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:51,170
But as bud would have put it down,

3896
01:52:51,171 --> 01:52:52,610
he also thought I'm a homeless junkie.

3897
01:52:52,611 --> 01:52:53,630
What the fuck am I going to do?

3898
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:54,783
Right.

3899
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:56,210
But had a really simple idea,

3900
01:52:57,010 --> 01:53:00,620
he gathered together a group of the other
homeless street addicts and he said,

3901
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:01,790
um,

3902
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:02,690
when we're not using,

3903
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:03,530
which is most of the time,

3904
01:53:03,531 --> 01:53:04,760
even people on the streets,

3905
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:09,650
what we should do is just drop a timetable
and go and look in the places where

3906
01:53:09,651 --> 01:53:10,550
we know people,

3907
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:11,743
where we she up.

3908
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:11,961
Right?

3909
01:53:11,961 --> 01:53:12,794
And if we see someone over,

3910
01:53:12,810 --> 01:53:13,643
we'll ring an ambulance,

3911
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:14,631
no officials,

3912
01:53:14,631 --> 01:53:15,231
nothing like that.

3913
01:53:15,231 --> 01:53:16,064
Just us.

3914
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:19,220
And loads of people had descended on
the downtown east side to come up with

3915
01:53:19,221 --> 01:53:20,570
problems to solve everything.

3916
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:22,160
And people were very skeptical,

3917
01:53:22,161 --> 01:53:23,120
but they liked bud.

3918
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:23,770
Ah,

3919
01:53:23,770 --> 01:53:24,080
okay.

3920
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:24,260
What?

3921
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:24,770
Duh.

3922
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:28,280
So they start going and searching and um,

3923
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:29,690
over the next three months,

3924
01:53:29,691 --> 01:53:32,510
the downtown that the death toll on
the downtown east side like had a

3925
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:33,470
significant fall.

3926
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:36,470
And obviously that meant people
who would have died were living,

3927
01:53:36,471 --> 01:53:37,161
which is a great thing,

3928
01:53:37,161 --> 01:53:38,840
but it also meant the addicts thought,

3929
01:53:38,841 --> 01:53:39,290
oh,

3930
01:53:39,290 --> 01:53:40,640
maybe we're not the pieces of shit.

3931
01:53:40,641 --> 01:53:41,840
Everyone says we are right.

3932
01:53:41,841 --> 01:53:43,580
Maybe we can do something.

3933
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:44,000
They're like,

3934
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:44,631
what else can we do?

3935
01:53:44,631 --> 01:53:45,710
Bud went to the library.

3936
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:47,270
He learned in Frankfurt.

3937
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:48,133
In Germany,

3938
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:49,940
they'd opened safe injection rooms,

3939
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:51,860
but like what happened in
California until they shut it down,

3940
01:53:51,861 --> 01:53:55,310
Anslinger shut it down when people could
go and use their drugs and be watched

3941
01:53:55,311 --> 01:53:58,280
by doctors and nurses and that this had
massively reduced deaths in Frankfurt.

3942
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,670
Nothing like this had happened in the
United States since Anslinger shut it all

3943
01:54:01,671 --> 01:54:02,450
down,

3944
01:54:02,450 --> 01:54:03,283
but buds like,

3945
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:04,663
okay,

3946
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:05,720
we'll persuade our map.

3947
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:09,470
They set up a group called van do the
Vancouver Area Network of drug users.

3948
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:10,513
Okay.

3949
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:14,910
The Mare was a conservative right wing
guy called Philip [inaudible] who have

3950
01:54:14,911 --> 01:54:15,920
been American comparison.

3951
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:17,233
It's not Trump.

3952
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:18,083
Mitt Romney,

3953
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:20,120
rich guy from a privileged
family didn't get,

3954
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,290
didn't know anything about addicts.

3955
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:21,741
He'd,

3956
01:54:21,741 --> 01:54:25,400
he'd run for office saying all the local
drug addict should be located to be

3957
01:54:25,401 --> 01:54:29,030
taken and detained to the local military
base and Chilliwack and never let out

3958
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:30,530
if she sends where he's coming from.

3959
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:31,250
Right.

3960
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:33,140
People are not optimistic
about persuading him.

3961
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:35,780
Van Do bud,

3962
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:36,740
his friends,

3963
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:39,860
they decide everywhere Philipo and goes,

3964
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:44,330
they're going to follow him with a
coffin and the coffin had written on it.

3965
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:45,710
Who will die next?

3966
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:49,760
[inaudible] before you open a
safe injection site every time.

3967
01:54:49,761 --> 01:54:51,500
But if I own spoken public,

3968
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:55,610
one of the homeless people with addiction
problems would stand up and say he

3969
01:54:55,611 --> 01:54:58,940
will dine xsplit poem before
you open a safe injection site.

3970
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:00,200
Um,

3971
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:00,711
one day,

3972
01:55:00,711 --> 01:55:01,341
Dean Wilson,

3973
01:55:01,341 --> 01:55:03,080
one of the main people in
van do stood up and said,

3974
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:05,330
do you remember Julia
who asked you recently?

3975
01:55:05,331 --> 01:55:06,200
He would die next.

3976
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,870
It turned out to be her because
you haven't done it right.

3977
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:10,520
This goes on for a long time.

3978
01:55:10,521 --> 01:55:12,320
They do loads of public actions.

3979
01:55:12,321 --> 01:55:14,660
They filled Oppenheimer Park,

3980
01:55:14,661 --> 01:55:19,190
which big park in Vancouver with a cross
more than a thousand crosses each one

3981
01:55:19,191 --> 01:55:20,870
representing someone who
had died of an overdose.

3982
01:55:20,871 --> 01:55:25,130
And they wrote the names of the people
on the crosses and one day after it's

3983
01:55:25,131 --> 01:55:26,300
been going on for years,

3984
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:28,010
it totally tastes credit.

3985
01:55:28,011 --> 01:55:28,940
Filippo in just said,

3986
01:55:28,941 --> 01:55:30,320
who the fuck are these people?

3987
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:31,243
What is this?

3988
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,860
And he went to meet loads of the addicts.

3989
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:34,731
He sat with them.

3990
01:55:34,731 --> 01:55:35,564
It blew his mind.

3991
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:36,840
He thought people with addiction poems,

3992
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:39,020
which just people who partied
too hard indulge themselves,

3993
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:40,460
he was completely shocked.

3994
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:44,250
He came here to the Untied
States to meet Milton Friedman,

3995
01:55:44,251 --> 01:55:48,600
the Nobel prize winning economist who
grown up under alcohol prohibition and

3996
01:55:48,601 --> 01:55:51,880
Milton Freeman Explains Drug
Prohibition to Phillip it,

3997
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:55,650
but upon comes back to Vancouver and
it holds a press conference and had the

3998
01:55:55,651 --> 01:55:56,484
chief of police,

3999
01:55:56,970 --> 01:56:00,240
the coroner and a representative of
the addicts and he says something like,

4000
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:03,780
I'm not going to speak again without
having the addicts here with me about

4001
01:56:03,781 --> 01:56:05,790
addiction because they
understand it better than me.

4002
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:09,690
We're going to open the first safe
injection site in North America.

4003
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:12,840
We're going to have the most compassionate
drug policies in North America.

4004
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:14,670
Things are gonna change around here,

4005
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:15,743
right?

4006
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:17,310
The open safe injection site.

4007
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:18,000
Filippo,

4008
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,980
his right wing party is so horrified.

4009
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:23,820
They de-select him as this
is the candidate and his
whole political career ends.

4010
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:27,150
But a more liberal guy wins the
election in the room stays open.

4011
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:27,990
Right.

4012
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:29,400
In the 10 years that followed,

4013
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:34,630
overdose deaths on the downtown east
side fell by 80% eight 0% right?

4014
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:37,980
Average life expectancy in that
neighborhood rose by 10 years.

4015
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:40,140
You just don't get figures
like that very often.

4016
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:43,530
And I remember the reason I
say it in relation to change,

4017
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:44,581
as you know,

4018
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:47,430
a big part of what I argue in chasing the
scream animal but lost connections is,

4019
01:56:47,431 --> 01:56:47,641
you know,

4020
01:56:47,641 --> 01:56:48,474
we,

4021
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:49,680
you don't write people off,

4022
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:50,550
right?

4023
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:53,460
But I realized I would
have written off Philipo in

4024
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:58,560
right wing guy runs for saying we should
lock them all up in the military base.

4025
01:56:58,561 --> 01:56:59,394
Right.

4026
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:01,050
You don't run off anyone.

4027
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:05,010
You don't know who can be persuaded by
message of love and compassion and the

4028
01:57:05,011 --> 01:57:06,150
most unlikely,

4029
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:09,570
one of the biggest champions of my book
is a conservative Evangelical Christian

4030
01:57:09,810 --> 01:57:10,501
in Mississippi.

4031
01:57:10,501 --> 01:57:10,651
Cool.

4032
01:57:10,651 --> 01:57:13,620
Christina Dennett who's doing
incredible work with this,

4033
01:57:13,621 --> 01:57:13,780
right.

4034
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:16,560
And I thought a lot about Filippone when
I went to go and see Phillip Ahmed on

4035
01:57:16,561 --> 01:57:19,020
the downtown east side and he said to me,

4036
01:57:19,021 --> 01:57:23,370
he would sacrifice his entire political
career all over again given the chance

4037
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:24,110
for this course.

4038
01:57:24,110 --> 01:57:24,481
And he said,

4039
01:57:24,481 --> 01:57:28,410
how often do you get to save thousands
of lives at the most vulnerable people?

4040
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:30,180
And after I got to know Bud Osborne,

4041
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:31,470
the guy who started this movement,

4042
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:33,673
um,

4043
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:34,710
he died.

4044
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:35,120
He,

4045
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:35,550
he,

4046
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:36,200
uh,

4047
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:36,980
and I remember,

4048
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:37,250
you know,

4049
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:38,310
he's only in his early sixties,

4050
01:57:38,311 --> 01:57:41,040
but he'd been a homeless
addict during a drug war.

4051
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:42,060
It takes a toll on you.

4052
01:57:43,050 --> 01:57:46,350
And they sealed off the streets of the
downtown east side where bought had lived

4053
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:49,830
as a homeless person and they had
this incredible memorial ceremony.

4054
01:57:49,831 --> 01:57:53,370
And there were loads of people at that
ceremony who knew that they were alive

4055
01:57:53,371 --> 01:57:54,720
because of what buttered started.

4056
01:57:54,721 --> 01:57:57,360
And because so many other people had
joined them and so many people who didn't

4057
01:57:57,361 --> 01:57:59,220
have addiction problems
that opened their hearts.

4058
01:57:59,221 --> 01:58:00,054
Right.

4059
01:58:00,570 --> 01:58:02,070
And I remember thinking that day,

4060
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:03,631
you know,

4061
01:58:03,631 --> 01:58:05,790
when you get disheartened about
this as easy to get disheartened,

4062
01:58:05,791 --> 01:58:05,940
right?

4063
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,560
This is a hundred year long drug war.

4064
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:09,293
Um,

4065
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:11,490
we're up against very powerful forces.

4066
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:15,420
Everyone watching your show,

4067
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:18,090
listening to your show is more
powerful than bud was that day,

4068
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:18,361
right?

4069
01:58:18,361 --> 01:58:19,350
The day he started that,

4070
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:20,363
right?

4071
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:21,361
It just,

4072
01:58:21,361 --> 01:58:23,580
by virtue of the fact they have a
device on which to listen to this,

4073
01:58:23,581 --> 01:58:24,210
right,

4074
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:28,200
but didn't sit there thinking
someone else is going to handle this.

4075
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:29,420
He didn't sit there thinking,

4076
01:58:29,421 --> 01:58:29,620
oh,

4077
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:30,453
well this is,

4078
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,940
we're up against these forces
that can't be defeated.

4079
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,680
He started where he stood.

4080
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:38,550
He appealed to the people around him and
it started this circle of change that,

4081
01:58:38,551 --> 01:58:38,731
you know,

4082
01:58:38,731 --> 01:58:42,880
the Canadian Supreme Court ruled because
the right wing government of Stephen

4083
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,410
Harper tried to shut
down this injection site.

4084
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:45,640
Um,

4085
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:48,370
and the Canadian Supreme Court ruled
that people with addiction promise have a

4086
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:49,150
right to light,

4087
01:58:49,150 --> 01:58:49,960
to live,

4088
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,930
and that includes a safe place to use
their drugs that will never be taken away

4089
01:58:52,931 --> 01:58:53,141
now,

4090
01:58:53,141 --> 01:58:53,650
right?

4091
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:54,550
That static is one.

4092
01:58:54,551 --> 01:58:55,384
But you know,

4093
01:58:55,850 --> 01:58:57,370
when you have nothing else,

4094
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,290
you have a voice.

4095
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:04,300
You have a human voice that you can use
to persuade other people with love and

4096
01:59:04,301 --> 01:59:05,134
compassion.

4097
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,000
You can tell them stories,

4098
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:11,080
you can build people's love and compassion
in the middle of this catastrophe

4099
01:59:11,081 --> 01:59:13,240
that we're seeing in this country
with the addiction crisis,

4100
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:13,810
right?

4101
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:17,740
I mean more people died last year and the
opiod crisis than all the soldiers who

4102
01:59:17,741 --> 01:59:19,120
died in the Vietnam war combined

4103
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:22,360
in the middle of this catastrophe.

4104
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:24,850
We can carry on doing
what we've been doing.

4105
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:25,930
Okay.

4106
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:26,800
We can carry on doing that,

4107
01:59:26,801 --> 01:59:29,770
then we will continue to get the
horrific results we are now getting.

4108
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:32,800
We can continue to copy the
places that have failed,

4109
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:33,670
right?

4110
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:35,350
At the end of a hundred
year long drug war,

4111
01:59:35,351 --> 01:59:36,610
those cost $1 trillion.

4112
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:41,770
We can't even keep drugs out of our
prisons where we have a wool perimeter and

4113
01:59:41,771 --> 01:59:43,510
we pay people to walk
around at the whole time.

4114
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:47,590
So good luck keeping them
out of a 3000 mile border.

4115
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:47,951
Right?

4116
01:59:47,951 --> 01:59:49,060
That will never happen.

4117
01:59:49,061 --> 01:59:50,680
That is a ludicrous fantasy.

4118
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:53,860
He may as well take all the money that
will be spent on trying to keep drugs

4119
01:59:53,861 --> 01:59:53,981
out.

4120
01:59:53,981 --> 01:59:55,300
That way I'm burning it in a pile.

4121
01:59:55,470 --> 01:59:55,720
Right?

4122
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:56,800
Is absurd.

4123
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:58,600
There's never been such a society.

4124
01:59:59,130 --> 01:59:59,963
Um,

4125
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:02,590
all we can start to copy the
places that have succeeded,

4126
02:00:02,591 --> 02:00:03,370
right?

4127
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:04,001
Portugal,

4128
02:00:04,001 --> 02:00:04,810
Switzerland,

4129
02:00:04,810 --> 02:00:06,340
Urgh why Canada?

4130
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:11,830
There are plenty of places that have
tried the alternatives and people who were

4131
02:00:11,831 --> 02:00:12,641
quite skeptical.

4132
02:00:12,641 --> 02:00:16,360
It's one thing that was most striking to
me and all those places is that people

4133
02:00:16,361 --> 02:00:18,160
who were initially skeptical

4134
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,400
and initially thought it was crazy,

4135
02:00:21,401 --> 02:00:22,990
very often change their minds.

4136
02:00:22,991 --> 02:00:24,280
This is the consistent pattern

4137
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:26,830
before it happens.

4138
02:00:26,831 --> 02:00:29,140
People think it's the work
of bunch of fucking Wackos.

4139
02:00:29,141 --> 02:00:30,400
They think why people would want to,

4140
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:30,851
you know,

4141
02:00:30,851 --> 02:00:32,800
get everyone to use drugs and
get children to use drugs.

4142
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:33,820
I think it's madness.

4143
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:37,210
And then they see that that's not at all
what motivates people who want reform.

4144
02:00:37,211 --> 02:00:38,044
And that's not,

4145
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:41,200
that's not what happens
in practice when you,

4146
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:43,870
when you adopt these policies and it's
not a magic bullet and they still have

4147
02:00:43,871 --> 02:00:44,650
problems,

4148
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:48,970
but there's been such a significant
improvement in all those places that the

4149
02:00:48,971 --> 02:00:50,200
resistance tends to,

4150
02:00:50,670 --> 02:00:50,831
I mean,

4151
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:53,350
how many people arguing for
reversing the cannabis legalization?

4152
02:00:53,351 --> 02:00:53,501
Hey,

4153
02:00:53,501 --> 02:00:54,490
you don't ever hear it now.

4154
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:54,970
Right?

4155
02:00:54,970 --> 02:00:57,280
And it's been a little bit of a
backlash and it kind of absurd.

4156
02:00:57,281 --> 02:01:00,120
But because it's come out repeatedly
kind of victor lie carters.

4157
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:00,751
Well,

4158
02:01:00,751 --> 02:01:02,150
I actually had that guy,

4159
02:01:02,190 --> 02:01:03,800
I really tell me about why.

4160
02:01:03,801 --> 02:01:04,051
How did it,

4161
02:01:04,051 --> 02:01:08,200
we had a debate between
him and Alex parents,

4162
02:01:08,201 --> 02:01:09,590
Dean and a doctor,

4163
02:01:09,591 --> 02:01:10,860
Mike Hart from Canada.

4164
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:11,730
Um,

4165
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:13,650
and there's some,

4166
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:17,970
there's some reality to the dangers of
cannabis use as some people that are

4167
02:01:17,971 --> 02:01:19,410
susceptible to schizophrenia.

4168
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:20,490
Um,

4169
02:01:20,490 --> 02:01:22,350
and I think that there's also some,

4170
02:01:22,351 --> 02:01:25,710
at least anecdotal evidence that points
to the fact that some people experience

4171
02:01:25,711 --> 02:01:30,570
the psychotic breaks and
these schizophrenia episodes
probably directly as a

4172
02:01:30,571 --> 02:01:34,050
result of large dose use of Thc,

4173
02:01:34,051 --> 02:01:37,200
whether it's through edibles or whether
it's through smoking at some people

4174
02:01:37,201 --> 02:01:37,681
freak out.

4175
02:01:37,681 --> 02:01:38,850
I've known people,

4176
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:40,370
I've known of people

4177
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,960
that have had real issues with it.

4178
02:01:41,961 --> 02:01:42,171
I mean,

4179
02:01:42,171 --> 02:01:43,670
had a comedian here are
a couple of weeks ago,

4180
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:45,440
talked about he doesn't smoke pot.

4181
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:46,251
He's from Brazil.

4182
02:01:46,251 --> 02:01:47,084
He smoked pot,

4183
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,920
use a vape pen,

4184
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:49,310
uh,

4185
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:51,920
took a bunch of hits and
was fucked up for two weeks.

4186
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:52,760
There are,

4187
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:54,740
there are dangers and problems,

4188
02:01:54,770 --> 02:01:55,410
certain pizza.

4189
02:01:55,410 --> 02:01:56,151
It's really important.

4190
02:01:56,151 --> 02:01:59,180
The case for legalizing cannabis is not
that there is no harm associated with

4191
02:01:59,181 --> 02:01:59,631
cannabis.

4192
02:01:59,631 --> 02:02:00,140
Right.

4193
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:02,270
In the same way the case for
legalizing alcohol is not,

4194
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:02,901
there's no homeless.

4195
02:02:02,901 --> 02:02:03,560
I said,

4196
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:06,500
this is what Alex Bernstein is
trying to go over in his book.

4197
02:02:06,501 --> 02:02:08,690
I don't think he did a
good job for two reasons.

4198
02:02:08,691 --> 02:02:09,380
One,

4199
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:14,380
because he's basically only making the
case for it to be negative and I think

4200
02:02:15,201 --> 02:02:19,790
there's far more evidence that cannabis
has had a positive influence on people.

4201
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,650
It reinforces community,

4202
02:02:21,651 --> 02:02:23,600
it makes people more sensitive and kind.

4203
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:26,180
This a thought of paranoia might actually,

4204
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:28,100
it makes people more humble.

4205
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:28,880
Um,

4206
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,000
it makes sex feel better
and fix food tastes better.

4207
02:02:32,001 --> 02:02:32,300
There's,

4208
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:35,210
there's creativity aspects
to it that are undeniable.

4209
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:37,610
There's a lot of very
positive aspects to it.

4210
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:39,170
For some people it's not good,

4211
02:02:39,171 --> 02:02:40,250
but it's like saying,

4212
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:41,203
hey,

4213
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:44,120
some people die when the
peanuts let's outlaw peanuts.

4214
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:47,450
I think that one of your
children about peanuts.

4215
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:47,690
Yeah.

4216
02:02:47,690 --> 02:02:48,890
I think everything you just said is,

4217
02:02:49,290 --> 02:02:50,210
is absolutely right.

4218
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:52,460
I think there's another layer
that's going on at the same time,

4219
02:02:52,510 --> 02:02:55,790
a kind of below that which is really
important people to understand.

4220
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:57,080
So there's this thing.

4221
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:58,010
Um,

4222
02:02:58,010 --> 02:02:59,390
so very often people will say,

4223
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:00,360
ah,

4224
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:01,700
you get kind of Republican politicians.

4225
02:03:01,701 --> 02:03:01,831
Like,

4226
02:03:01,831 --> 02:03:03,590
cause I'm a colleague Thena
Rena saying it during,

4227
02:03:03,591 --> 02:03:05,630
when the Republican debates in 2016,

4228
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:06,733
2015 maybe,

4229
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:07,963
um,

4230
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:11,180
we can't legalize cannabis because it's
much stronger now than it used to be.

4231
02:03:11,190 --> 02:03:12,380
THC content is coming up,

4232
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:13,220
people smoking skunk.

4233
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:15,320
It's really important to
understand why that happened.

4234
02:03:15,321 --> 02:03:16,760
It's because of drug prohibition.

4235
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:21,170
So the day before alcohol was banned in
the u s the most popular drinks by far

4236
02:03:21,171 --> 02:03:22,004
were beer and wine.

4237
02:03:22,150 --> 02:03:22,983
Right?

4238
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:27,350
In the weeks after alcohol prohibition
ended most popular drinks again,

4239
02:03:27,351 --> 02:03:30,050
where beer and wine as
they are today in between,

4240
02:03:30,051 --> 02:03:32,060
you could not get hold of bear
unwind the most popular drinks,

4241
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:33,770
whiskey and Moonshine UNICA.

4242
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:34,071
You think,

4243
02:03:34,071 --> 02:03:34,904
well

4244
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:36,763
why would that be?

4245
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:37,603
What's going on?

4246
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:41,240
And it's because of a kind of
slightly wonky and boring thing,

4247
02:03:41,241 --> 02:03:44,390
but I think it's worth talking about
is called the Iron Law of prohibition.

4248
02:03:44,391 --> 02:03:47,890
If you imagine if we had to
smuggle the nearest bar to hit,

4249
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:52,190
if we had to smuggle all the alcohol for
that bar in a wagon from the Canadian

4250
02:03:52,191 --> 02:03:52,380
bar,

4251
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:53,211
from the Mexican border,

4252
02:03:53,211 --> 02:03:54,080
right from Tijuana

4253
02:03:55,730 --> 02:03:56,330
in a wagon,

4254
02:03:56,330 --> 02:03:57,440
we fill our wagon with bear,

4255
02:03:57,441 --> 02:03:59,180
we're going to get drink for 400 people.

4256
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:00,210
If we fill it with vogue cover,

4257
02:04:00,211 --> 02:04:01,730
get drink for thousands of people,

4258
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:02,593
right?

4259
02:04:02,630 --> 02:04:05,780
So when you find a drug and
it has to be smuggled around,

4260
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:09,530
you get a premium on getting the
biggest possible kick into the smallest

4261
02:04:09,531 --> 02:04:10,340
possible space,

4262
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:10,820
right?

4263
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:14,930
This is why mild forms of
the drug disappear before
opiates were banned in the

4264
02:04:14,931 --> 02:04:15,764
United States.

4265
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:19,000
Most popular way of consuming it was
something called Mrs Winslow sue things

4266
02:04:19,001 --> 02:04:19,640
Syrup,

4267
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:20,810
which you would buy in the pharmacy,

4268
02:04:20,811 --> 02:04:20,991
right?

4269
02:04:20,991 --> 02:04:22,640
Very low level of opiates.

4270
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:27,530
Most popular way of consuming cocoa based
products prior to the banning was Coca

4271
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:27,560
Cola,

4272
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:27,800
right?

4273
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:28,850
It's called that for a reason.

4274
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:29,540
Uh,

4275
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:30,740
when the ban happens,

4276
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:32,090
heroin becomes something from opiates.

4277
02:04:32,091 --> 02:04:34,220
Powder cocaine becomes
the only form of cocaine.

4278
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:34,731
In fact,

4279
02:04:34,731 --> 02:04:39,120
when there's a huge crackdown on powder
cocaine in the 80s the iron law kicks in

4280
02:04:39,121 --> 02:04:41,520
even more and that's when
crack is invented because
you can get even more of a

4281
02:04:41,521 --> 02:04:43,500
hair into an even smaller possible space.

4282
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:44,040
Right?

4283
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:46,120
So I think he's important.

4284
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:47,560
Understand if you want,

4285
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:48,930
it is not good.

4286
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:53,040
Most people who drink alcohol don't want
to drink vodka and they certainly don't

4287
02:04:53,041 --> 02:04:54,570
want drink absinthe most of the time.

4288
02:04:54,571 --> 02:04:55,050
Right.

4289
02:04:55,050 --> 02:04:57,180
Most people want a mild
form of their drug.

4290
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:57,871
That's true.

4291
02:04:57,871 --> 02:04:58,351
Cannabis.

4292
02:04:58,351 --> 02:04:58,621
That's true.

4293
02:04:58,621 --> 02:04:58,831
Of course,

4294
02:04:58,831 --> 02:05:01,830
there's some people who want
to get totally fucked up
either for fun or because

4295
02:05:01,831 --> 02:05:02,530
they have addiction problems.

4296
02:05:02,530 --> 02:05:06,150
Most people want a mild form of the drug
is not good that malforms or the drug

4297
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:07,163
when they're not.

4298
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,400
I don't think that's true.

4299
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:09,570
It's definitely not true.

4300
02:05:09,571 --> 02:05:10,500
In California,

4301
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:11,311
in California,

4302
02:05:11,311 --> 02:05:15,210
what happened was medical care cannabis
got passed and once medical cannabis got

4303
02:05:15,211 --> 02:05:15,930
passed,

4304
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:20,930
there was a an emphasis on the strongest
possible stuff because people wanted

4305
02:05:21,601 --> 02:05:22,410
it.

4306
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:22,651
I mean,

4307
02:05:22,651 --> 02:05:26,340
it was a direct result of people having
higher tolerances because marijuana was

4308
02:05:26,341 --> 02:05:27,960
so readily available and they,

4309
02:05:27,961 --> 02:05:30,660
if you have a high tolerance
and you smoke a lot of pot,

4310
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:34,230
you want strong pot because
week pot doesn't do anything.

4311
02:05:34,230 --> 02:05:39,210
It's the number one complaint amongst
cannabis enthusiasts is someone having

4312
02:05:39,211 --> 02:05:40,050
week pops.

4313
02:05:40,051 --> 02:05:42,780
You've got a subculture of people
who are cannabis enthusiasts.

4314
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:44,550
Who do you write?

4315
02:05:44,551 --> 02:05:44,990
There's a sub.

4316
02:05:44,990 --> 02:05:47,270
Just like there's a subculture of
people who want Volcker App south.

4317
02:05:47,271 --> 02:05:47,600
Right,

4318
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:47,761
right.

4319
02:05:47,761 --> 02:05:49,440
But I don't think it's a matter.

4320
02:05:49,441 --> 02:05:50,400
It's not the same thing.

4321
02:05:50,401 --> 02:05:53,580
Like gender obviously is more potent
than whiskey or then beer rather.

4322
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:55,590
It's easier to carry gen around.

4323
02:05:55,620 --> 02:05:56,940
You have to carry less of it.

4324
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:57,991
With cannabis,

4325
02:05:57,991 --> 02:06:00,030
people are still buying the same quantity.

4326
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:04,860
They're just getting more
fucked up because their
tolerances are so much higher.

4327
02:06:04,861 --> 02:06:06,870
They need a stronger and stronger THC.

4328
02:06:06,871 --> 02:06:08,580
So as you have a legal market,

4329
02:06:08,581 --> 02:06:10,320
you can have a variety of options.

4330
02:06:11,210 --> 02:06:12,090
What you have is what,

4331
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,500
what we'll discover.

4332
02:06:13,501 --> 02:06:14,820
I think as time goes by,

4333
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:17,310
because we know with alcohol is different.

4334
02:06:17,311 --> 02:06:19,080
People want cannabis
to do different things.

4335
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:19,531
You're totally right.

4336
02:06:19,531 --> 02:06:22,320
There's some people who want
maximum THC maximally fucked up.

4337
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:26,220
Some people where there's still a
market for for lower grade we'd,

4338
02:06:26,221 --> 02:06:29,310
I mean they have it listed
at all these dispensaries.

4339
02:06:29,610 --> 02:06:30,421
They have it listed,

4340
02:06:30,421 --> 02:06:30,691
you know,

4341
02:06:30,691 --> 02:06:33,240
20% 35% they have it listed.

4342
02:06:33,241 --> 02:06:36,270
So you can choose a more mild
marijuana if you like to,

4343
02:06:36,271 --> 02:06:37,380
but the gee people,

4344
02:06:37,381 --> 02:06:38,910
the people that do it every day,

4345
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:40,830
of course they want
that really potent weed.

4346
02:06:40,831 --> 02:06:45,230
It's not like I would say they're more
like the people in Vegas who gamble a

4347
02:06:45,231 --> 02:06:48,840
professional gamblers versus the people
who go to Vegas for the weekend and just

4348
02:06:48,841 --> 02:06:49,710
want to play a real well.

4349
02:06:49,890 --> 02:06:54,000
There's definitely a concentrated market
of very dedicated users who want to get

4350
02:06:54,001 --> 02:06:54,900
maximally fucked up.

4351
02:06:54,901 --> 02:06:55,760
You're totally right now.

4352
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:57,530
I think that's what pushed the Po.

4353
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:01,500
I mean it's also in botanists and I'm
friends with a bunch of people who breed

4354
02:07:01,501 --> 02:07:03,270
and grow these various strains.

4355
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:04,503
If you think about,

4356
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:07,950
so professor David [inaudible] has
done really interesting work on this.

4357
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:09,151
If I remember rightly,

4358
02:07:09,151 --> 02:07:11,400
there's 38 active components in cannabis,

4359
02:07:11,401 --> 02:07:11,910
right?

4360
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:13,010
So cannabinoids,

4361
02:07:13,011 --> 02:07:14,520
so there's hundreds of cannabinoids.

4362
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:16,080
I think the,

4363
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:16,410
if I'm,

4364
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:17,243
if from press and elsewhere,

4365
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:17,831
he,

4366
02:07:17,831 --> 02:07:21,000
he'll gives this kind of
significant active components.

4367
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:22,051
Maybe other people.

4368
02:07:22,051 --> 02:07:22,140
Yeah.

4369
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:23,370
I think there's over a hundred,

4370
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:23,880
uh,

4371
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:25,680
canabinoids I think we
just discussed this,

4372
02:07:25,681 --> 02:07:25,801
right?

4373
02:07:25,801 --> 02:07:25,970
Right.

4374
02:07:25,970 --> 02:07:26,311
Then we,

4375
02:07:26,311 --> 02:07:26,940
uh,

4376
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:30,090
so one of the things he Auggie's and I'm
happy to be corrected on the specific

4377
02:07:30,091 --> 02:07:30,301
number,

4378
02:07:30,301 --> 02:07:31,190
but one of the things he,

4379
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:33,300
he Auggie's um,

4380
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:35,170
is you've got it,

4381
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:36,220
cause you're talking about schizophrenia

4382
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:36,821
and psychosis.

4383
02:07:36,821 --> 02:07:40,750
I think it's important to understand
there is some evidence that very high

4384
02:07:40,751 --> 02:07:44,230
exposure to THC in a small
number of people can,

4385
02:07:44,290 --> 02:07:45,970
can lead to psychosis.

4386
02:07:45,971 --> 02:07:46,450
Right?

4387
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:49,090
And that's even a small number of people
where you have a very widely used drug

4388
02:07:49,091 --> 02:07:49,270
is,

4389
02:07:49,270 --> 02:07:50,440
is that's really problematic.

4390
02:07:50,441 --> 02:07:51,010
Right?

4391
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:53,380
But actually this was range the evidence.

4392
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:58,560
So why do people who are prone to
psychosis or schizophrenia want cannabis?

4393
02:07:59,111 --> 02:07:59,351
Right?

4394
02:07:59,351 --> 02:08:00,790
Cause there is a lot of them who want it.

4395
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:01,953
It's not the people,

4396
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:04,540
hardly anyone wants to
have a psychotic episode.

4397
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:07,150
It's actually so THC,

4398
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:08,253
um,

4399
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:09,070
uh,

4400
02:08:09,070 --> 02:08:09,850
correlates with,

4401
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:11,170
with psychosis in some people.

4402
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:12,910
But there's another component,

4403
02:08:12,911 --> 02:08:14,410
cannabis called CBD,

4404
02:08:15,370 --> 02:08:16,180
Cannabidiol,

4405
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:19,150
which actually we know there's good
evidence soothes the psychosis and

4406
02:08:19,151 --> 02:08:19,841
schizophrenia,

4407
02:08:19,841 --> 02:08:20,051
right?

4408
02:08:20,051 --> 02:08:23,800
It's actually given us a treatment in
some places in distilled pill form.

4409
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:28,420
So actually it's a slightly more complex
picture then cannabis causes psychosis,

4410
02:08:28,421 --> 02:08:29,254
right?

4411
02:08:29,530 --> 02:08:32,500
Very rich THC in some
people will cause psychosis.

4412
02:08:32,501 --> 02:08:33,550
That's a real problem.

4413
02:08:33,730 --> 02:08:36,010
There are things we
can do to prevent that.

4414
02:08:36,011 --> 02:08:39,280
And one of the good things about
legal market is you can regulate it.

4415
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:41,920
So we can limit the amount
of THC that is available.

4416
02:08:41,921 --> 02:08:42,910
Just like we can limit,

4417
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:45,510
you can't go and buy 70% proof alcohol,

4418
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:46,790
but also what,

4419
02:08:46,791 --> 02:08:46,940
what,

4420
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:49,000
what professor not has been
arguing is we need to be,

4421
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:50,260
and they exist,

4422
02:08:50,261 --> 02:08:53,170
but they need to be
commercialized and promoted more,

4423
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:54,250
um,

4424
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:57,010
or promoting public health way
and not necessarily commercially,

4425
02:08:57,260 --> 02:08:58,093
um,

4426
02:08:58,330 --> 02:09:01,580
CBD rich cannabis will actually be
helpful to people with psychosis and

4427
02:09:01,581 --> 02:09:02,260
schizophrenia.

4428
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:03,690
It's just a slightly
more complicated picture.

4429
02:09:03,691 --> 02:09:04,130
I know that you,

4430
02:09:04,130 --> 02:09:04,580
you,

4431
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:06,600
you're not saying that it is,

4432
02:09:06,730 --> 02:09:08,550
you're not endorsing what the,

4433
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:09,221
tell your kids got.

4434
02:09:09,221 --> 02:09:09,950
What's it called again?

4435
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:11,830
I'm the guy who did your debate.

4436
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:12,640
Um,

4437
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:13,310
our experienced,

4438
02:09:13,310 --> 02:09:14,143
yeah,

4439
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:17,350
I know you're not endorsing the kind
of simplistic view on either side,

4440
02:09:17,351 --> 02:09:18,184
but the,

4441
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:18,790
the,

4442
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:19,420
um,

4443
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,470
I think it's slightly more,

4444
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:21,910
slightly more complicated than that.

4445
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:23,830
The other thing I think is really
worth saying though to people is,

4446
02:09:23,980 --> 02:09:26,320
there's one thing we will do agree on,

4447
02:09:26,321 --> 02:09:29,230
which is cannabis is
bad for young teenagers,

4448
02:09:29,231 --> 02:09:29,501
right?

4449
02:09:29,501 --> 02:09:30,730
It's after developing brains.

4450
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:33,070
There's one person that
interview to really helped me to,

4451
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:33,341
again,

4452
02:09:33,341 --> 02:09:35,620
to think about this guy
called Fred Martins,

4453
02:09:35,890 --> 02:09:36,371
who's in,

4454
02:09:36,371 --> 02:09:37,570
I went to go see him in Camden,

4455
02:09:37,571 --> 02:09:38,404
New Jersey,

4456
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:39,581
and Fred was a co,

4457
02:09:39,581 --> 02:09:40,211
he's retired now,

4458
02:09:40,211 --> 02:09:41,044
but he was a cop.

4459
02:09:41,370 --> 02:09:44,140
I was really kind of right
when it reminded me of the
clinics were character and

4460
02:09:44,141 --> 02:09:44,681
dirty Harry.

4461
02:09:44,681 --> 02:09:45,311
He's not a liberal.

4462
02:09:45,311 --> 02:09:46,000
Right.

4463
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,620
And he had this,

4464
02:09:47,621 --> 02:09:48,790
he wouldn't use a fancy word like this,

4465
02:09:48,791 --> 02:09:51,370
but he had an epiphany
about drug legalization.

4466
02:09:51,371 --> 02:09:53,670
One day he was at a car park in Wayne,

4467
02:09:53,671 --> 02:09:58,671
New Jersey in 1971 it was staking out
a dealer and he's in plain clothes

4468
02:09:59,261 --> 02:09:59,681
obviously.

4469
02:09:59,681 --> 02:10:02,530
And a kid comes up to him like an 11
year old or something and it goes,

4470
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:02,891
hey,

4471
02:10:02,891 --> 02:10:03,724
Mr.

4472
02:10:04,150 --> 02:10:04,983
Um,

4473
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:07,840
I'm not allowed to buy alcohol where you
go in to that liquor store and buy some

4474
02:10:07,841 --> 02:10:08,674
for me.

4475
02:10:09,190 --> 02:10:09,671
And frank goes,

4476
02:10:09,671 --> 02:10:09,821
no,

4477
02:10:09,821 --> 02:10:10,654
get outta here.

4478
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:14,170
So the kid walks over to the drug dealer
and buy some drugs from him instead.

4479
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:16,330
And Fred has this kind of realization,

4480
02:10:16,331 --> 02:10:17,050
which is,

4481
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:17,830
oh,

4482
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:18,790
he wouldn't put it this way,

4483
02:10:18,791 --> 02:10:22,750
but legalization puts a regulatory barrier
between kids and drugs that doesn't

4484
02:10:22,751 --> 02:10:23,590
currently exist.

4485
02:10:23,591 --> 02:10:24,130
Right?

4486
02:10:24,130 --> 02:10:26,560
This is why since they
legalized cannabis in Colorado,

4487
02:10:26,561 --> 02:10:27,280
there's been this,

4488
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:28,031
don't overstate it.

4489
02:10:28,031 --> 02:10:28,511
It's not huge,

4490
02:10:28,511 --> 02:10:31,140
but there's been a significant
fall in teenage cannabis,

4491
02:10:31,210 --> 02:10:31,750
right?

4492
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:34,970
Drug dealers don't check ID
licensed legal businesses.

4493
02:10:34,971 --> 02:10:38,090
Do they really care if they're there
because they've got something to lose?

4494
02:10:38,091 --> 02:10:38,924
Right.

4495
02:10:39,110 --> 02:10:43,220
So I think if sometimes it's used as
that kind of protect our kids argument is

4496
02:10:43,221 --> 02:10:44,450
used as a case for prohibition.

4497
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:45,523
In fact,

4498
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:46,790
if you want to protect your kids,

4499
02:10:46,791 --> 02:10:50,300
you should be putting a big premium on
getting these substances out of the hands

4500
02:10:50,301 --> 02:10:54,770
of armed criminal gangs and into the
hands of licensed legal businesses.

4501
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:55,541
Yeah.

4502
02:10:55,541 --> 02:10:57,160
I don't think anybody's
going to argue that.

4503
02:10:57,190 --> 02:10:59,530
I mean I think that
anybody rational rather,

4504
02:10:59,730 --> 02:11:00,020
uh,

4505
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:01,240
I think that makes a lot of sense.

4506
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:02,110
I think that,

4507
02:11:02,110 --> 02:11:02,770
um,

4508
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:03,220
the,

4509
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:07,780
the number of people that
have schizophrenia is fairly,

4510
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:12,730
it's fairly stable in terms of the
percentage of it across the board,

4511
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:15,220
cannabis users or non cannabis users.

4512
02:11:15,221 --> 02:11:19,060
And so the argument against this idea
that cannabis causes a schizo frantic

4513
02:11:19,061 --> 02:11:22,690
breaks is that these people already have
schizophrenia and it just hasn't really

4514
02:11:22,691 --> 02:11:24,150
manifested itself in a,

4515
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:25,510
in a tangible sense.

4516
02:11:25,570 --> 02:11:27,220
So this is one of the
things professor nuts says.

4517
02:11:27,221 --> 02:11:27,950
So there's this,

4518
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:31,960
there is some evidence that cannabis
in a small number of people causes

4519
02:11:31,961 --> 02:11:34,900
psychosis as a study in Sweden that
showed this with schizophrenia,

4520
02:11:34,901 --> 02:11:35,980
it's much more contested.

4521
02:11:36,060 --> 02:11:36,893
So,

4522
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:39,000
so psychosis versus schizophrenia.

4523
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:41,220
What is the major distinction?

4524
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:42,281
Yeah,

4525
02:11:42,281 --> 02:11:43,480
I have not researched this in depth,

4526
02:11:43,481 --> 02:11:44,314
but um,

4527
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:46,030
psychosis involves,

4528
02:11:46,570 --> 02:11:47,400
um,

4529
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,320
is that the different,

4530
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:50,010
the different paranoia.

4531
02:11:50,110 --> 02:11:53,040
Schizophrenia is a subset of
mental illness is very specific,

4532
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:55,000
has a significant genetic component,

4533
02:11:55,210 --> 02:11:57,460
although there can be
environmental triggers for it.

4534
02:11:57,490 --> 02:11:58,990
So it could possibly trigger both.

4535
02:11:59,020 --> 02:12:02,590
It could possibly trigger psychosis and
schizophrenia argument against the APP.

4536
02:12:02,620 --> 02:12:03,220
So professor.

4537
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:04,840
So there is evidence with psychosis,

4538
02:12:04,841 --> 02:12:06,220
the argument when a stress,

4539
02:12:06,221 --> 02:12:07,390
it's a very small number of people,

4540
02:12:07,391 --> 02:12:08,224
but it Israel,

4541
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:09,363
um,

4542
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:09,950
uh,

4543
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:12,350
and there are things we can do in
a legal market to counteract that,

4544
02:12:12,351 --> 02:12:14,140
that are much harder to
do in a prohibited market.

4545
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:15,490
But with schizophrenia,

4546
02:12:15,491 --> 02:12:16,271
the argument against it,

4547
02:12:16,271 --> 02:12:18,160
and I've not looked into this
and a huge amount of detail,

4548
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:19,113
so I don't want to,

4549
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:22,330
this is not the same degree of confidence
I've been saying the other stuff,

4550
02:12:22,331 --> 02:12:22,590
but,

4551
02:12:22,590 --> 02:12:23,200
um,

4552
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:24,430
professor not argues,

4553
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:25,270
well,

4554
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:28,960
we know that cannabis use has
massively increased in Britain,

4555
02:12:28,961 --> 02:12:29,591
for example,

4556
02:12:29,591 --> 02:12:33,580
I think something like 20 fold increase
since 1916 Britain and yet levels of

4557
02:12:33,581 --> 02:12:34,870
schizophrenia have remained the same.

4558
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:37,210
If cannabis was causing schizophrenia,

4559
02:12:37,211 --> 02:12:41,140
you would expect it to
vary with cannabis use,

4560
02:12:41,141 --> 02:12:41,951
at least to some degree,

4561
02:12:41,951 --> 02:12:42,940
there'd be some relationship.

4562
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:44,530
And that doesn't seem to be the case.

4563
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:45,191
So again,

4564
02:12:45,191 --> 02:12:45,440
I,

4565
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:46,031
that's what professor,

4566
02:12:46,031 --> 02:12:46,271
not,

4567
02:12:46,271 --> 02:12:49,270
who's the former chief scientific
advisor on drugs in Britain says,

4568
02:12:49,330 --> 02:12:50,650
I haven't looked into
that in great detail.

4569
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:52,990
So He's basically right.

4570
02:12:52,991 --> 02:12:55,090
And all the things that I
have looked into that he says,

4571
02:12:55,610 --> 02:12:56,430
hmm,

4572
02:12:56,430 --> 02:12:57,263
mmm,

4573
02:12:57,540 --> 02:13:02,220
do they know what the mechanism would be
that would cause someone to consume THC

4574
02:13:02,221 --> 02:13:03,900
and have a psychotic break?

4575
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:05,011
Have that,

4576
02:13:05,011 --> 02:13:05,930
does that have been examined?

4577
02:13:05,931 --> 02:13:06,571
I don't enough about it.

4578
02:13:06,571 --> 02:13:07,800
That would seem to be a big issue.

4579
02:13:07,801 --> 02:13:08,071
Right?

4580
02:13:08,071 --> 02:13:12,470
Like find out what it is that's causing
this trigger and whether or not this

4581
02:13:12,471 --> 02:13:13,770
exists in these people anyway,

4582
02:13:13,771 --> 02:13:17,760
and maybe a stressful situation
and a bad breakup losing their job.

4583
02:13:17,761 --> 02:13:18,880
Maybe one of those things could also,

4584
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:19,580
it's true.

4585
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:21,920
Well we know with all mental health,

4586
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:26,030
all aspects of mental health
or mental health problems,

4587
02:13:26,870 --> 02:13:28,430
there were three kinds of calls,

4588
02:13:28,431 --> 02:13:29,160
right?

4589
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:29,993
Those,

4590
02:13:30,130 --> 02:13:31,130
my bit lost connections,

4591
02:13:31,140 --> 02:13:31,711
which about depression,

4592
02:13:31,711 --> 02:13:32,190
anxieties,

4593
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:33,023
a lot about this.

4594
02:13:33,210 --> 02:13:34,710
There are biological causes,

4595
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:36,660
things like your jeans,

4596
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:37,710
real brain changes,

4597
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:39,390
things like the introduction of a drug.

4598
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:43,470
There are psychological causes to how you
think about yourself and your place in

4599
02:13:43,471 --> 02:13:43,741
the world.

4600
02:13:43,741 --> 02:13:45,180
And then there's environmental causes.

4601
02:13:45,181 --> 02:13:45,511
Like,

4602
02:13:45,511 --> 02:13:46,344
you know,

4603
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,520
how we live with each other,

4604
02:13:47,521 --> 02:13:48,480
things like loneliness,

4605
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:49,343
that sort of thing.

4606
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:50,220
Um,

4607
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:53,310
and in all mental health
phenomena to some degree,

4608
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:54,870
these three sets of courses player.

4609
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:56,520
So let's think about even something very,

4610
02:13:56,860 --> 02:13:57,300
uh,

4611
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:58,133
dementia.

4612
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:02,220
Dementia as a very obviously
has a heavy biological driver,

4613
02:14:02,221 --> 02:14:02,820
right?

4614
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:06,210
Dementia is a physical degeneration of
the brain or a disease like Alzheimer's.

4615
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:07,290
Um,

4616
02:14:07,290 --> 02:14:08,610
but even with dementia,

4617
02:14:08,611 --> 02:14:10,890
which has this very
heavy biological driver,

4618
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:14,280
we know there are big social
and psychological effects
that can mitigate it.

4619
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:17,640
So if you're part of a strong community
and have lots of social connections,

4620
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:19,230
if you have a positive self image,

4621
02:14:19,231 --> 02:14:20,550
if you speak other languages,

4622
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:23,490
you're dementia will develop significantly
more slowly than if you don't have

4623
02:14:23,491 --> 02:14:24,570
any of these factors,

4624
02:14:24,571 --> 02:14:25,260
right?

4625
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:26,970
So with things like psychosis,

4626
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,760
there's a brilliant person
called Tanya Lurman,

4627
02:14:29,790 --> 02:14:33,600
Professor Daniel Lemon at Stanford
University who's done really interesting,

4628
02:14:33,650 --> 02:14:33,930
uh,

4629
02:14:33,930 --> 02:14:35,430
research and sandwich
and to in great detail,

4630
02:14:35,431 --> 02:14:36,264
but I interviewed her,

4631
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:37,400
um,

4632
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:37,730
who,

4633
02:14:37,730 --> 02:14:38,031
who,

4634
02:14:38,031 --> 02:14:38,760
who shown.

4635
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:43,760
So we know recovery from psychosis or
schizophrenia is much stronger in African

4636
02:14:44,221 --> 02:14:46,170
countries than it is in the United States.

4637
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:46,770
Right?

4638
02:14:46,770 --> 02:14:49,980
And it's not a genetic thing because
Africans who come to the United States end

4639
02:14:49,981 --> 02:14:51,960
up having the American level of recovery,

4640
02:14:51,970 --> 02:14:53,400
not the African level of recovery.

4641
02:14:53,970 --> 02:14:54,940
And um,

4642
02:14:54,941 --> 02:14:55,261
again,

4643
02:14:55,261 --> 02:14:57,840
it's a while since I spoke [inaudible]
I don't want to overstate my confidence

4644
02:14:57,841 --> 02:14:58,171
about this,

4645
02:14:58,171 --> 02:14:59,010
but there are other people,

4646
02:14:59,011 --> 02:15:00,330
there are people I think including her,

4647
02:15:00,690 --> 02:15:01,980
who argue in part.

4648
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:04,470
What's going on is in many,

4649
02:15:04,530 --> 02:15:05,041
not all.

4650
02:15:05,041 --> 02:15:06,240
Some places it's really brutal,

4651
02:15:06,241 --> 02:15:07,290
but in many parts of Africa,

4652
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:09,270
you remain part of the community.

4653
02:15:09,271 --> 02:15:10,950
Even if you have these
mental health problems,

4654
02:15:10,951 --> 02:15:11,430
right?

4655
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:13,260
They have much stronger
social connections.

4656
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,060
It's a study that asks Americans,

4657
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:18,510
how many close friends do you have
who you could turn to in a crisis?

4658
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:20,160
And when they started doing it years ago,

4659
02:15:20,161 --> 02:15:21,600
the most common answer was five.

4660
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:22,351
Today,

4661
02:15:22,351 --> 02:15:23,790
the most common answer is none,

4662
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:24,780
right?

4663
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:25,501
It's not the average,

4664
02:15:25,501 --> 02:15:26,550
but it's most common answer.

4665
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:29,310
Half of all Americans asked,

4666
02:15:29,311 --> 02:15:30,420
how many people know you?

4667
02:15:30,421 --> 02:15:32,100
Well say nobody,

4668
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:33,143
right?

4669
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:34,920
It's a huge amount of evidence.

4670
02:15:35,730 --> 02:15:38,640
Loneliness is toxic for human beings.

4671
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:41,340
Lonely people as guided
a to experiments on this.

4672
02:15:41,341 --> 02:15:41,910
Here in La,

4673
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:46,910
lonely people exposed to the flu virus
and the cold virus and the colds are way

4674
02:15:48,391 --> 02:15:50,670
more likely to actually get
them the non lonely people.

4675
02:15:50,910 --> 02:15:51,520
Right.

4676
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:51,990
Um,

4677
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:55,080
it's just devastating for your physical
and mental health to be lonely.

4678
02:15:55,081 --> 02:15:56,340
There's other things going on.

4679
02:15:56,610 --> 02:15:59,250
So I think there's a whole range of
things that are going on with all mental

4680
02:15:59,251 --> 02:15:59,641
health problems.

4681
02:15:59,641 --> 02:16:01,230
I don't know how this relates
to cannabis and psychosis.

4682
02:16:01,231 --> 02:16:01,830
I don't want to,

4683
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:02,610
I don't know.

4684
02:16:02,610 --> 02:16:03,990
But we know with psychosis,

4685
02:16:04,230 --> 02:16:04,420
yeah,

4686
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:04,740
there's,

4687
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:06,270
there's a big debate about this.

4688
02:16:06,271 --> 02:16:07,620
Immigrants are more
likely to have psychosis.

4689
02:16:07,630 --> 02:16:08,910
The nonimmigrant says there's a whole,

4690
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:09,810
um,

4691
02:16:09,810 --> 02:16:11,520
lots of environmental factors playing out,

4692
02:16:11,550 --> 02:16:12,930
even in extreme mental health problems.

4693
02:16:12,931 --> 02:16:15,090
Like now I want to stress
they're not the only thing.

4694
02:16:15,091 --> 02:16:17,280
There are real biological aspects as well,

4695
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:17,940
uh,

4696
02:16:17,940 --> 02:16:21,750
which are clearly very significant and
things like schizophrenia and play some

4697
02:16:21,751 --> 02:16:23,790
role in things like depression
for a lot of people.

4698
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:24,810
But,

4699
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:25,470
but yeah,

4700
02:16:25,470 --> 02:16:26,303
so that makes sense.

4701
02:16:29,130 --> 02:16:29,710
Yeah.

4702
02:16:29,710 --> 02:16:29,980
I mean,

4703
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,700
sort of.

4704
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:31,300
Yeah.

4705
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:31,800
I mean,

4706
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:34,420
obviously there's varying
biological factors,

4707
02:16:34,421 --> 02:16:35,920
but the cultural factors make sense.

4708
02:16:35,921 --> 02:16:38,290
The fact that these
people in Africa are not,

4709
02:16:38,590 --> 02:16:40,450
they're not expelled from the community,

4710
02:16:40,570 --> 02:16:44,710
so they have a sense of bond and
maybe it's more easy to recover.

4711
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:46,420
And one of the things that you hear about,

4712
02:16:46,810 --> 02:16:50,650
part of the problem with mental illness
is that people with mental illness are

4713
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:51,491
pushed away.

4714
02:16:51,491 --> 02:16:55,240
People don't want to deal with their
problem and it exacerbates whatever is

4715
02:16:55,241 --> 02:16:56,590
causing it in the first place.

4716
02:16:57,310 --> 02:16:58,510
What drugs have you used?

4717
02:16:58,590 --> 02:17:00,580
Just have to be slightly Kaplan.

4718
02:17:00,581 --> 02:17:01,031
My answer,

4719
02:17:01,031 --> 02:17:04,560
because I'm in an immigration
process a lot to me,

4720
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:06,370
I got a prescription legal drugs,

4721
02:17:06,850 --> 02:17:09,010
so I used to drug illegally.

4722
02:17:09,011 --> 02:17:13,150
That is prescription drug is so
called Modafinil or provigil.

4723
02:17:13,330 --> 02:17:14,350
Why did you use it illegally?

4724
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:16,980
It's pretty easy to get a prescription
for nine Britain register.

4725
02:17:17,010 --> 02:17:18,070
Explain to people who don't know.

4726
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:19,870
Pro Provigil is a drug that was developed.

4727
02:17:19,871 --> 02:17:23,200
People with narcolepsy was
actually developed as a

4728
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:27,250
a performance enhancer and they just
had to find a reason to use it the other

4729
02:17:27,251 --> 02:17:27,551
way round.

4730
02:17:27,551 --> 02:17:28,090
How interesting.

4731
02:17:28,090 --> 02:17:29,710
They had to find a reason to use it.

4732
02:17:29,711 --> 02:17:31,900
And the reason to use it was to say,

4733
02:17:31,901 --> 02:17:32,111
oh,

4734
02:17:32,111 --> 02:17:33,520
let's give it to people with narcolepsy.

4735
02:17:33,730 --> 02:17:34,563
Let's do that.

4736
02:17:34,580 --> 02:17:35,830
Let's check to see if that's true,

4737
02:17:35,831 --> 02:17:39,310
because that's how it's been explained
to me by actually by my doctor.

4738
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:39,761
Oh,

4739
02:17:39,761 --> 02:17:40,510
that's really interesting.

4740
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:41,680
I perfectly prepared to,

4741
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:43,000
I don't know about that,

4742
02:17:43,001 --> 02:17:44,590
but sounds plausible to me that,

4743
02:17:45,130 --> 02:17:46,690
so I think for me,

4744
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:48,400
do you use that a lot?

4745
02:17:48,790 --> 02:17:49,001
No.

4746
02:17:49,001 --> 02:17:50,350
So is it now,

4747
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:51,670
so for me,

4748
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:52,270
um,

4749
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:54,340
I think I did have an addiction to that.

4750
02:17:54,370 --> 02:17:55,151
What had addiction to,

4751
02:17:55,151 --> 02:17:56,140
was working all the time.

4752
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:58,240
I grew up in a

4753
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:04,090
crazy and violent environment in many
ways and my way of where there's addiction

4754
02:18:04,091 --> 02:18:07,780
and other things and my way of coping in
that environment was to read and write

4755
02:18:07,781 --> 02:18:12,610
all the time to just not be present by
just working right in front of a small

4756
02:18:12,611 --> 02:18:13,444
child.

4757
02:18:13,770 --> 02:18:15,010
And as I got older,

4758
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:15,940
um,

4759
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:17,860
that was really my way
of being in the world,

4760
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:18,101
right.

4761
02:18:18,101 --> 02:18:19,360
To work all the time.

4762
02:18:19,810 --> 02:18:20,643
Um,

4763
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:21,820
and I think when I got into my,

4764
02:18:21,821 --> 02:18:23,740
like late twenties,

4765
02:18:23,741 --> 02:18:24,340
I can't remember,

4766
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:25,750
I wrote an article about
Modafinil so it could,

4767
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:26,470
I could find,

4768
02:18:26,470 --> 02:18:27,550
figure out when I started taking it.

4769
02:18:27,551 --> 02:18:28,384
But the,

4770
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:30,610
cause I initially wrote a very
positive article about it.

4771
02:18:31,480 --> 02:18:32,313
Um,

4772
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:37,000
I was at that point where the obsessive
and compulsive work wasn't working for

4773
02:18:37,001 --> 02:18:37,570
me.

4774
02:18:37,570 --> 02:18:37,870
Right.

4775
02:18:37,870 --> 02:18:42,340
It wasn't an like a lot of
people with addictive behavior.

4776
02:18:42,910 --> 02:18:46,390
I was doubling down on the thing
that wasn't working that well.

4777
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:47,920
So for me,

4778
02:18:47,921 --> 02:18:48,970
Modafinil was,

4779
02:18:48,971 --> 02:18:51,100
or provigil I bought it on the Internet.

4780
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:52,413
Um,

4781
02:18:54,460 --> 02:18:59,350
was a way I thought initially and make
it so I could work even more hours to be

4782
02:18:59,351 --> 02:19:00,220
even more right.

4783
02:19:00,550 --> 02:19:02,020
And initially when you start taking it,

4784
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,510
a lot of people take it
before exams for example.

4785
02:19:05,190 --> 02:19:05,650
Um,

4786
02:19:05,650 --> 02:19:06,820
it does make you feel,

4787
02:19:06,821 --> 02:19:08,110
it's not a caffeine buzz.

4788
02:19:08,111 --> 02:19:09,160
It wasn't for me anyway,

4789
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:11,740
it's just you feel like you can just,

4790
02:19:12,370 --> 02:19:12,551
yeah.

4791
02:19:12,551 --> 02:19:14,590
Have feeling when someone put it to me,

4792
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:15,390
it wasn't a scientist,

4793
02:19:15,390 --> 02:19:16,121
it could be bullshit.

4794
02:19:16,121 --> 02:19:16,920
But,

4795
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:17,440
um,

4796
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:19,240
so we evolved to,

4797
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:21,073
uh,

4798
02:19:21,510 --> 02:19:22,920
we had this thing called executive focus,

4799
02:19:22,921 --> 02:19:23,370
right.

4800
02:19:23,370 --> 02:19:24,630
I'm executive focus on now,

4801
02:19:24,631 --> 02:19:26,150
I'm really concentrating
on what I'm saying to you.

4802
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:27,680
You the signals coming you right.

4803
02:19:28,090 --> 02:19:31,580
But obviously we can't be in a state
of executive focus all the time,

4804
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:32,414
right?

4805
02:19:34,010 --> 02:19:35,560
But what Modafinil does is it,

4806
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:38,630
it makes you much more in a state
of executive focus for longer.

4807
02:19:38,990 --> 02:19:40,310
And you can see why
people evolved to do that.

4808
02:19:40,311 --> 02:19:41,144
If you were,

4809
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,340
and where we have all of
you being chased by a lion,

4810
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:45,980
you're brain just switches off
all the other shit and he's like,

4811
02:19:45,981 --> 02:19:47,180
get the fuck away from the lion.

4812
02:19:47,181 --> 02:19:47,421
Right?

4813
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:47,750
Right.

4814
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:52,280
And my understanding is that
modafinil triggers that,

4815
02:19:52,310 --> 02:19:52,911
that state,

4816
02:19:52,911 --> 02:19:53,840
not a panicked state,

4817
02:19:53,841 --> 02:19:54,674
but uh,

4818
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:55,760
executive focus date,

4819
02:19:56,330 --> 02:19:57,380
which is good for a while,

4820
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:59,660
except there are two really
big downsides to that.

4821
02:19:59,661 --> 02:20:00,020
Firstly,

4822
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:02,420
you don't sleep and if you don't sleep,

4823
02:20:02,421 --> 02:20:03,320
you were fucking crazy.

4824
02:20:03,350 --> 02:20:07,460
I'd never heard that there's an issue
with sleeping and modafinil or provigil.

4825
02:20:07,461 --> 02:20:07,851
In fact,

4826
02:20:07,851 --> 02:20:09,380
that's one of the positive aspects of it,

4827
02:20:09,381 --> 02:20:10,400
that you can sleep on it.

4828
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:10,761
Oh,

4829
02:20:10,761 --> 02:20:11,060
well,

4830
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:11,211
I mean,

4831
02:20:11,211 --> 02:20:13,640
it was designed for people who
find it hard to stay awake.

4832
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:15,740
And that's not true.

4833
02:20:15,810 --> 02:20:16,530
Oh,

4834
02:20:16,530 --> 02:20:17,363
that's what I'm reading.

4835
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:18,360
What are you reading that?

4836
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:18,690
Uh,

4837
02:20:18,690 --> 02:20:19,920
the guy who discovered it,

4838
02:20:19,921 --> 02:20:23,340
Michael is Uva was a sleep study.

4839
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:24,060
Yeah.

4840
02:20:24,060 --> 02:20:29,060
Neurophysiologist and was working on the
compound add dry or address funnel and

4841
02:20:30,811 --> 02:20:33,150
then they discovered then made modafinil,

4842
02:20:33,151 --> 02:20:34,590
which is a stronger version of that.

4843
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:35,360
Mm.

4844
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:35,721
So mine,

4845
02:20:35,721 --> 02:20:39,500
is there anything that says that
it was originally developed?

4846
02:20:39,950 --> 02:20:41,170
See anything like that?

4847
02:20:41,650 --> 02:20:42,490
Fucking doctor.

4848
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:44,560
Yeah.

4849
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:46,060
My experience was t two problems.

4850
02:20:46,061 --> 02:20:47,020
So firstly,

4851
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:47,740
um,

4852
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:49,860
I don't know how everyone says I haven't
done a huge amount of research on this

4853
02:20:49,861 --> 02:20:50,590
drug.

4854
02:20:50,590 --> 02:20:53,770
My experience was firstly not sleeping,

4855
02:20:53,771 --> 02:20:55,330
which is really bad for you over time.

4856
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:58,090
And secondly actually if
you're in that focused mode,

4857
02:20:58,730 --> 02:20:59,320
so your,

4858
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:01,480
your mind needs time wandering.

4859
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:02,381
Sorry.

4860
02:21:02,381 --> 02:21:03,730
You mind needs time to wonder.

4861
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:04,510
Right.

4862
02:21:04,510 --> 02:21:05,560
It needs time.

4863
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:06,581
You know,

4864
02:21:06,581 --> 02:21:08,440
if I just leave here and
walk out there on the street,

4865
02:21:08,441 --> 02:21:12,400
my brain will just start wondering around
loads of things and then it will go

4866
02:21:12,401 --> 02:21:14,800
back into executive focus when I
do the next interview or whatever.

4867
02:21:15,130 --> 02:21:19,150
You need those periods when you're not
in exact focus when you're exactly,

4868
02:21:19,420 --> 02:21:20,350
well not even recovery.

4869
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:22,180
That's where recovery is part of it.

4870
02:21:22,690 --> 02:21:24,580
That's when your brain
often has creative thoughts.

4871
02:21:24,581 --> 02:21:25,120
Right.

4872
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,550
When you're wondering where your mind is
wondering when things will come to you

4873
02:21:27,730 --> 02:21:31,120
cause that a certain amount of your mind
is processing things even though you're

4874
02:21:31,121 --> 02:21:31,954
not conscious of it.

4875
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:33,990
That's what I felt with
new vigil that it didn't,

4876
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:35,190
new vigil or pro vigil,

4877
02:21:35,191 --> 02:21:36,024
they're very similar.

4878
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:40,590
It didn't seem like there
was much creativity going
on that it was more of like

4879
02:21:41,010 --> 02:21:42,810
a grunt tool.

4880
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:43,673
How long did you use it?

4881
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:44,170
Portrait?

4882
02:21:44,170 --> 02:21:44,850
Um,

4883
02:21:44,850 --> 02:21:45,480
I mean I,

4884
02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:47,100
I would not use it regularly.

4885
02:21:47,101 --> 02:21:50,850
I would take it like
once a couple of weeks,

4886
02:21:50,851 --> 02:21:52,170
once a week or so like that.

4887
02:21:52,310 --> 02:21:52,510
Uh,

4888
02:21:52,510 --> 02:21:53,060
how long?

4889
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:54,500
Um,

4890
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:56,180
I think I did it for like a year,

4891
02:21:56,210 --> 02:21:57,043
a year or so,

4892
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:57,950
and then I just stopped.

4893
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:59,240
I haven't taken it in years.

4894
02:21:59,650 --> 02:22:00,040
Right,

4895
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:00,320
right.

4896
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:01,153
But I liked it.

4897
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:02,073
What did you like

4898
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:02,721
from,

4899
02:22:02,721 --> 02:22:03,200
um,

4900
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:06,800
some guy was a bio hacker who was the
one who told me about it and he said it

4901
02:22:06,801 --> 02:22:08,300
was pretty easy to get
a prescription for it.

4902
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:09,740
I've got a prescription for it.

4903
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:10,550
And uh,

4904
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:14,990
it just gave you like this pepped up
sense of a focus and awareness felt you

4905
02:22:14,991 --> 02:22:17,090
could get a lot done when you're on it,

4906
02:22:17,091 --> 02:22:20,690
but it didn't seem like it helped with
those wandering creative thoughts as you

4907
02:22:20,691 --> 02:22:21,250
were saying.

4908
02:22:21,250 --> 02:22:21,491
Yeah.

4909
02:22:21,491 --> 02:22:22,930
If I was ever going to do exams again,

4910
02:22:22,931 --> 02:22:24,310
which fortunate we'll never do in my life,

4911
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:25,473
I,

4912
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,610
I would use that.

4913
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:27,750
But I think,

4914
02:22:27,810 --> 02:22:28,561
I think you're right.

4915
02:22:28,561 --> 02:22:30,510
And I think again,

4916
02:22:30,511 --> 02:22:31,344
thinking about that

4917
02:22:33,590 --> 02:22:36,030
about in relation to addiction,

4918
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:40,320
I think often when you talk
about sing like work addiction,

4919
02:22:40,321 --> 02:22:40,580
right?

4920
02:22:40,580 --> 02:22:43,740
[inaudible] caused by partly
childhood trauma that I'd experienced.

4921
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:46,920
There's been a real change in
how we think about that as well.

4922
02:22:46,921 --> 02:22:49,260
It relates back to what we're saying
right at the start about chemical hooks,

4923
02:22:49,261 --> 02:22:49,950
right?

4924
02:22:49,950 --> 02:22:51,890
So if you look at the debate about um,

4925
02:22:52,250 --> 02:22:54,000
non drug based addictions,

4926
02:22:54,001 --> 02:22:54,251
right?

4927
02:22:54,251 --> 02:22:55,680
If think about 20 years ago,

4928
02:22:56,010 --> 02:22:58,470
people start talking about sex
addiction guy called Stanton peal,

4929
02:22:58,471 --> 02:23:02,190
who I interviewed a lot first writes
about love addiction or smiling exactly.

4930
02:23:02,191 --> 02:23:04,560
Gambling addiction at the time.

4931
02:23:04,561 --> 02:23:05,500
Initially what people say,

4932
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:07,920
well this is bullshit because they
believe the chemical hooks there of

4933
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:08,290
addiction.

4934
02:23:08,290 --> 02:23:08,531
Right,

4935
02:23:08,531 --> 02:23:09,120
right.

4936
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:09,931
So it just seems like,

4937
02:23:09,931 --> 02:23:10,530
well that's not,

4938
02:23:10,530 --> 02:23:12,000
I mean there's an episode
of cheers actually,

4939
02:23:12,001 --> 02:23:14,130
which I'm now we're be,

4940
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:14,490
yeah,

4941
02:23:14,490 --> 02:23:15,360
you wouldn't do this,

4942
02:23:15,361 --> 02:23:18,990
but there's an episode where the whole
hilarious premise of the show is that

4943
02:23:18,991 --> 02:23:19,780
what's the Ted Danson,

4944
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:20,613
Sam Malone,

4945
02:23:20,970 --> 02:23:25,110
Danson's character thinks he's a sex
addict and this is like a punch line all

4946
02:23:25,111 --> 02:23:25,861
the way through the show.

4947
02:23:25,861 --> 02:23:26,041
Right?

4948
02:23:26,041 --> 02:23:27,890
This was the attitude that ends with,

4949
02:23:27,891 --> 02:23:31,440
it goes through an meeting of sex and
love addicts anonymous and like there's

4950
02:23:31,441 --> 02:23:33,630
some women talking about how she
gets like has sex with every,

4951
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:36,390
every Madden ends with him just putting
his arm around her and that's the end of

4952
02:23:36,391 --> 02:23:36,720
the,

4953
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:37,471
the end of the show.

4954
02:23:37,471 --> 02:23:37,741
Right.

4955
02:23:37,741 --> 02:23:38,760
That wouldn't happen in a sitcom.

4956
02:23:38,761 --> 02:23:39,594
Now people,

4957
02:23:39,930 --> 02:23:40,763
people thought,

4958
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:41,611
well it might,

4959
02:23:41,611 --> 02:23:43,680
but people,

4960
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:44,760
people don't think the,

4961
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:47,430
the very idea of sex addiction is
ridiculous in the way they did.

4962
02:23:47,430 --> 02:23:47,700
Right.

4963
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:48,321
I don't think,

4964
02:23:48,321 --> 02:23:49,530
I think maybe they do.

4965
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:50,100
Maybe,

4966
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:54,690
but then I think that's because
there hasn't been a shift in gamble.

4967
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:55,341
If you go to a meeting,

4968
02:23:55,341 --> 02:23:57,240
a gambler's anonymous
as I have with a friend,

4969
02:23:57,241 --> 02:23:57,361
not,

4970
02:23:57,361 --> 02:23:58,380
I don't have a gambling problem,

4971
02:23:58,381 --> 02:23:59,400
but just to support someone.

4972
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:03,300
They are as addicted as anyone in the
next room down at narcotics anonymous.

4973
02:24:03,301 --> 02:24:03,510
No one,

4974
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:04,231
a lot of,

4975
02:24:04,231 --> 02:24:05,520
not a lot of gambling addicts.

4976
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:07,590
And did you feel that
they were as a dictator,

4977
02:24:07,650 --> 02:24:08,150
they're there,

4978
02:24:08,150 --> 02:24:10,800
they're straight up junkies and
they might as well be chasing crack.

4979
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:11,090
He,

4980
02:24:11,090 --> 02:24:13,740
and that tells us something
really important because
you don't snore a roulette

4981
02:24:13,741 --> 02:24:14,040
wheel,

4982
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:14,251
right?

4983
02:24:14,251 --> 02:24:16,740
You don't inject a an online poker,

4984
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:17,430
right?

4985
02:24:17,430 --> 02:24:19,470
If you can have a professor
not said this to me,

4986
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:22,770
if you can have all of the addiction,

4987
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:27,270
but none of the chemical hooks that tells
us about how we've overestimated the

4988
02:24:27,271 --> 02:24:28,050
role of calories,

4989
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:28,351
addiction,

4990
02:24:28,351 --> 02:24:29,310
Chemical Hook,

4991
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:31,260
there's a dopamine addiction.

4992
02:24:31,350 --> 02:24:34,350
Well absolutely everything you do
that you like gives you dopamine.

4993
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:34,951
It haven't been hit.

4994
02:24:34,951 --> 02:24:37,260
So I think there's been this
attempt to integrate it by going,

4995
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:40,770
oh well there's this pleasure in the
brain and but it's also a of self

4996
02:24:40,771 --> 02:24:41,790
destructive issue.

4997
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:43,410
There's something about gambling,

4998
02:24:43,411 --> 02:24:46,380
there's a lot of self hate involved.

4999
02:24:46,381 --> 02:24:46,521
And,

5000
02:24:46,521 --> 02:24:46,890
and,

5001
02:24:46,890 --> 02:24:47,010
uh,

5002
02:24:47,010 --> 02:24:47,510
this,

5003
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:50,990
this overwhelming feeling
of failure that a lot of,

5004
02:24:50,991 --> 02:24:51,540
uh,

5005
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:54,640
gambling addicts hub because
they fail so often and they're,

5006
02:24:54,641 --> 02:24:56,230
they're always trying to chase the dragon.

5007
02:24:56,250 --> 02:24:58,350
They're always trying to make
up for all the past things.

5008
02:24:58,351 --> 02:24:59,190
They've gone wrong.

5009
02:24:59,220 --> 02:25:01,500
This big score with this big score,

5010
02:25:01,501 --> 02:25:04,800
are we going to settle it
out towards me about it?

5011
02:25:04,801 --> 02:25:06,390
Just think about what you're
saying in relation to him.

5012
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:08,340
A guy called Peter Cohen,

5013
02:25:08,341 --> 02:25:12,600
he's a professor in the Netherlands who
actually didn't say this to me directly.

5014
02:25:12,601 --> 02:25:13,390
I read it.

5015
02:25:13,390 --> 02:25:13,860
Um,

5016
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:17,340
he says we shouldn't call it addiction.

5017
02:25:17,370 --> 02:25:18,450
We should call it bonding.

5018
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:21,750
Human beings have an innate
need to bond and connect.

5019
02:25:21,751 --> 02:25:22,584
Right?

5020
02:25:22,950 --> 02:25:24,340
And you're happy and healthy.

5021
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:28,240
Your bond and connect with like the
people around you with meaningful work.

5022
02:25:28,980 --> 02:25:32,470
If you can't do that cause you're
isolated or traumatized or beaten down by

5023
02:25:32,471 --> 02:25:32,741
life,

5024
02:25:32,741 --> 02:25:33,910
we haven't been taught how to do that.

5025
02:25:35,050 --> 02:25:38,590
You will bond with something that
gives you some sense of relief.

5026
02:25:38,591 --> 02:25:40,690
Right now for some people
that might be porn,

5027
02:25:40,691 --> 02:25:42,940
for some people that might be gambling,

5028
02:25:42,941 --> 02:25:44,260
for some people might be cocaine,

5029
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:44,801
alcohol,

5030
02:25:44,801 --> 02:25:45,634
whatever.

5031
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:46,031
But it says,

5032
02:25:46,031 --> 02:25:46,864
if you,

5033
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:50,350
if you only have one bond
that's given you any relief,

5034
02:25:50,351 --> 02:25:52,270
you will obsessively
returned to that bond.

5035
02:25:52,330 --> 02:25:52,960
Right.

5036
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:53,990
And I don't think that's a total lie.

5037
02:25:54,130 --> 02:25:54,390
He,

5038
02:25:54,390 --> 02:25:55,031
and as he would say,

5039
02:25:55,031 --> 02:25:57,280
that's not a total explanation
for what's going on.

5040
02:25:57,540 --> 02:26:00,520
But I do think that is a useful way to
think about some of these behavioral

5041
02:26:00,521 --> 02:26:00,971
addictions.

5042
02:26:00,971 --> 02:26:01,390
Right?

5043
02:26:01,390 --> 02:26:02,020
So I,

5044
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:03,550
someone I know very well,

5045
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:04,300
um,

5046
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:07,120
a relative of mine has a gambling
addiction and this is someone who has,

5047
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:09,760
yeah.

5048
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:13,120
No alternative form of joy
or pleasure in their life.

5049
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:13,983
Right?

5050
02:26:14,630 --> 02:26:15,463
And

5051
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:16,710
yeah,

5052
02:26:16,710 --> 02:26:20,250
gambling gives a moment
among lots of moments.

5053
02:26:21,030 --> 02:26:21,970
I've just such,

5054
02:26:22,050 --> 02:26:24,020
if you look at someone who's
playing online poker as I've done,

5055
02:26:24,021 --> 02:26:24,111
my,

5056
02:26:24,111 --> 02:26:24,944
my relative,

5057
02:26:26,010 --> 02:26:27,570
they're not happy or
it's not a look at it.

5058
02:26:27,571 --> 02:26:28,710
Someone watching a nice movie,

5059
02:26:28,711 --> 02:26:29,130
right?

5060
02:26:29,130 --> 02:26:29,790
It's,

5061
02:26:29,790 --> 02:26:30,241
you can see,

5062
02:26:30,241 --> 02:26:30,840
I don't mean,

5063
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:31,440
I'm sorry.

5064
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:34,050
I should be someone with an addiction
problem playing online poker.

5065
02:26:34,051 --> 02:26:34,590
Some people have,

5066
02:26:34,590 --> 02:26:35,730
most people don't have a problem,

5067
02:26:35,890 --> 02:26:36,723
right?

5068
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:38,943
It's the,

5069
02:26:39,030 --> 02:26:43,830
it's the relief of just being absent from
your life for a moment or for however

5070
02:26:43,831 --> 02:26:44,461
long you play,

5071
02:26:44,461 --> 02:26:45,720
rather than,

5072
02:26:46,410 --> 02:26:47,243
um,

5073
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:50,430
I went to this fellow's connections,

5074
02:26:50,431 --> 02:26:51,211
my book about depression.

5075
02:26:51,211 --> 02:26:55,350
I went to the first ever Internet
Rehab Center in the United States.

5076
02:26:55,670 --> 02:26:56,810
It's a weird places,

5077
02:26:57,050 --> 02:26:58,710
oppressive place such that
I liked the people there.

5078
02:26:59,130 --> 02:27:01,470
It's in Spokane and just
outside Spokane in Washington.

5079
02:27:02,310 --> 02:27:03,270
It's called restart,

5080
02:27:03,390 --> 02:27:04,320
restart Washington.

5081
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:06,330
And I remember going there.

5082
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:06,960
Really,

5083
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:09,060
it was really interesting
to think about this.

5084
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:10,920
Um,

5085
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:11,880
I remember arriving,

5086
02:27:11,881 --> 02:27:13,080
it's a clearing in the woods,

5087
02:27:13,081 --> 02:27:13,261
right?

5088
02:27:13,261 --> 02:27:14,970
A big wooden place in the
clearing of the woods.

5089
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:19,570
I remember absolutely
instinctively looking at my
phone and feeling really when

5090
02:27:19,590 --> 02:27:21,870
a minute I got out the car and fit of
really pissed off that I can check my

5091
02:27:21,871 --> 02:27:22,171
email.

5092
02:27:22,171 --> 02:27:22,400
I was like,

5093
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:22,591
oh wait,

5094
02:27:22,591 --> 02:27:23,311
you're in the right place.

5095
02:27:23,311 --> 02:27:24,090
Right.

5096
02:27:24,090 --> 02:27:24,923
Um,

5097
02:27:24,990 --> 02:27:25,651
and it's an ancient cause.

5098
02:27:25,651 --> 02:27:27,450
They get all kinds of people
and restart Washington,

5099
02:27:27,451 --> 02:27:31,330
but they disproportionately get young men
who are obsessed with multiplayer role

5100
02:27:31,331 --> 02:27:31,771
play games.

5101
02:27:31,771 --> 02:27:32,320
Like,

5102
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:34,350
then it would have been world of
Warcraft and how it'd be fortnight.

5103
02:27:35,790 --> 02:27:37,950
And speaking to these young men

5104
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:41,491
have this realization,

5105
02:27:41,491 --> 02:27:42,810
talking to the woman who runs it.

5106
02:27:42,811 --> 02:27:44,660
It's amazing when called Dr Hillary cash.

5107
02:27:45,470 --> 02:27:46,440
He said to me,

5108
02:27:47,430 --> 02:27:48,510
you've got to ask.

5109
02:27:49,290 --> 02:27:50,730
I think it relates to what
you saying about gambling.

5110
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:54,870
You got to ask what these young men are
getting out of this game because they're

5111
02:27:54,871 --> 02:27:55,710
getting something out of it.

5112
02:27:55,711 --> 02:27:56,544
Right?

5113
02:27:56,880 --> 02:28:00,810
And she argues that one of the things
that getting is the things they used to

5114
02:28:00,811 --> 02:28:01,890
get from the culture,

5115
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:03,390
but no longer gap.

5116
02:28:03,450 --> 02:28:04,080
Like what,

5117
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,040
what are filling?

5118
02:28:05,041 --> 02:28:05,910
They're good at something,

5119
02:28:06,470 --> 02:28:07,920
a feeling that other people see them,

5120
02:28:07,921 --> 02:28:09,060
that they're part of a tribe,

5121
02:28:09,470 --> 02:28:10,950
a feeling that they're moving around,

5122
02:28:10,951 --> 02:28:11,210
you know,

5123
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:11,610
um,

5124
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:13,830
kids spend very little time outdoors now.

5125
02:28:13,860 --> 02:28:14,370
Right?

5126
02:28:14,370 --> 02:28:16,080
I think there's also anticipation.

5127
02:28:16,081 --> 02:28:16,891
There's puzzles,

5128
02:28:16,891 --> 02:28:19,140
there's things where you're trying to
figure out whether or not something's

5129
02:28:19,141 --> 02:28:20,610
right or wrong and how to get it.

5130
02:28:20,820 --> 02:28:22,010
And if you do get it,

5131
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:24,200
you get this positive
surge of you don't get,

5132
02:28:24,540 --> 02:28:24,700
I mean,

5133
02:28:24,700 --> 02:28:27,920
I think there's human reward systems that
are being mirrored there in gambling.

5134
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:29,580
And what psychologists call,

5135
02:28:29,610 --> 02:28:31,020
call that feeling of mastery.

5136
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:31,830
The masters,

5137
02:28:31,830 --> 02:28:33,330
when you feel you are good at something,

5138
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:33,630
right?

5139
02:28:33,630 --> 02:28:35,850
It's an absolutely underlying
psychological need.

5140
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:37,680
Everyone needs to feel
that good at something.

5141
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:39,600
If you don't have a sense
of mastery in your life,

5142
02:28:39,601 --> 02:28:40,800
you will be depressed and anxious.

5143
02:28:40,801 --> 02:28:41,220
Right?

5144
02:28:41,220 --> 02:28:43,290
Or you're much more likely to
become depressed and anxious.

5145
02:28:43,590 --> 02:28:44,423
And I think again,

5146
02:28:44,490 --> 02:28:45,810
because it's very striking to me,

5147
02:28:45,811 --> 02:28:47,070
I've got teenage nephews,

5148
02:28:47,130 --> 02:28:48,000
I've got sons.

5149
02:28:49,170 --> 02:28:52,200
We actually don't ask
anything of young men.

5150
02:28:52,470 --> 02:28:53,040
Right?

5151
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:56,280
Very rarely are they actually
asked to do very much.

5152
02:28:56,670 --> 02:28:58,740
They're not given responsibilities.

5153
02:28:58,741 --> 02:28:59,011
Right.

5154
02:28:59,011 --> 02:29:01,350
I think I look again,

5155
02:29:01,351 --> 02:29:03,510
I want to stress and most people
playing video games or not addicted,

5156
02:29:03,990 --> 02:29:05,160
it's perfectly good form a pleasure.

5157
02:29:05,161 --> 02:29:06,150
They're very addictive.

5158
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:06,990
I mean,

5159
02:29:06,990 --> 02:29:07,823
they're not.

5160
02:29:07,890 --> 02:29:10,240
Most people playing them have a
healthy relationship with them.

5161
02:29:10,241 --> 02:29:10,681
And the same way that,

5162
02:29:10,681 --> 02:29:11,970
I don't know if that's true,

5163
02:29:12,040 --> 02:29:13,230
can maybe tell me about it.

5164
02:29:13,360 --> 02:29:15,820
A lot of people playing them
have a real problem with them.

5165
02:29:15,821 --> 02:29:17,710
They take up massive hours at a time.

5166
02:29:17,711 --> 02:29:19,870
It's a giant problem with young boys.

5167
02:29:20,350 --> 02:29:21,090
I mean the,

5168
02:29:21,090 --> 02:29:25,210
the thing is it's become an
actual avenue for career.

5169
02:29:25,211 --> 02:29:30,211
Now there's east sports careers where
these young guys are making millions of

5170
02:29:30,850 --> 02:29:31,840
dollars playing video games.

5171
02:29:31,841 --> 02:29:33,640
It's not like the old
days where you would say,

5172
02:29:33,641 --> 02:29:33,851
hey,

5173
02:29:33,851 --> 02:29:34,750
you're wasting your life.

5174
02:29:34,990 --> 02:29:37,300
Now it's basically almost
like practicing golf.

5175
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:39,220
But we have a set up back here.

5176
02:29:39,221 --> 02:29:41,110
Well we play video games
against each other.

5177
02:29:41,111 --> 02:29:42,310
That's very addictive.

5178
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:43,450
Don't you think it's addictive?

5179
02:29:43,930 --> 02:29:44,550
Sure.

5180
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:45,383
Yeah,

5181
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:46,960
so it's like basketball
when I was younger too,

5182
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:48,490
I loved playing basketball,

5183
02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:49,960
couldn't get me to play in the rain.

5184
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:54,730
The basketball has movement and exercise
attached to it so you get some positive

5185
02:29:54,731 --> 02:29:55,780
benefit from that addiction.

5186
02:29:55,810 --> 02:29:57,550
I was definitely addicted to Jujitsu.

5187
02:29:58,010 --> 02:29:59,620
I would even train when I was injured,

5188
02:29:59,710 --> 02:30:00,011
you know?

5189
02:30:00,011 --> 02:30:00,970
But what does that mean?

5190
02:30:00,971 --> 02:30:03,340
It means I enjoyed it more
than I enjoyed not doing it.

5191
02:30:03,730 --> 02:30:08,020
The difference between a lot of video
game addictions and particularly gambling

5192
02:30:08,021 --> 02:30:11,140
addictions is that they tend
to wreck people's lives.

5193
02:30:11,390 --> 02:30:11,841
You didn't,

5194
02:30:11,841 --> 02:30:13,760
when you had this period
of Jujitsu addiction,

5195
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:14,773
did you,

5196
02:30:14,780 --> 02:30:17,570
did you cause they
distinction distinction there?

5197
02:30:17,990 --> 02:30:21,350
What are you doing it to avoid some kind
of pain in your life or were you doing

5198
02:30:21,351 --> 02:30:22,910
it because you just really deeply loved?

5199
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:23,753
It's really fun.

5200
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:24,490
Brio.

5201
02:30:24,490 --> 02:30:25,790
See chasing the thrill.

5202
02:30:25,910 --> 02:30:26,241
I mean,

5203
02:30:26,241 --> 02:30:30,770
I'm certain that was avoiding pain with
almost everything I've done in my life

5204
02:30:30,830 --> 02:30:31,401
in some way,

5205
02:30:31,401 --> 02:30:32,270
shape or form.

5206
02:30:32,490 --> 02:30:32,660
You know,

5207
02:30:32,660 --> 02:30:35,870
there's some of it where you're trying
to do something positive to mitigate the

5208
02:30:35,871 --> 02:30:39,800
pain or the frustration or the anger
or whatever it is that's bothering you.

5209
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:41,270
But I don't,

5210
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:41,920
you know,

5211
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:42,130
I,

5212
02:30:42,130 --> 02:30:42,261
I,

5213
02:30:42,261 --> 02:30:44,240
the video game thing was
a real addiction though.

5214
02:30:44,241 --> 02:30:45,470
It's like a compulsion.

5215
02:30:45,660 --> 02:30:47,390
And Alan was yours.

5216
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:48,250
Yeah.

5217
02:30:48,250 --> 02:30:48,960
How did you,

5218
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:49,950
how did you get out of the Jay?

5219
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:50,893
I quit.

5220
02:30:51,140 --> 02:30:52,610
I just quit cold Turkey.

5221
02:30:53,030 --> 02:30:53,900
Stop playing.

5222
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:57,140
I realized it was kind of messing up my
life and my career was just taking up

5223
02:30:57,141 --> 02:30:58,220
way too much time.

5224
02:30:58,580 --> 02:30:58,960
And I just,

5225
02:30:58,960 --> 02:30:59,200
I,

5226
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:00,860
I came to a realization and I was like,

5227
02:31:00,861 --> 02:31:01,910
I gotta stop doing this.

5228
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:03,260
I'm just playing way too much.

5229
02:31:03,910 --> 02:31:04,670
And so I just said,

5230
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:05,630
the only way I,

5231
02:31:05,631 --> 02:31:06,830
I'm just too competitive.

5232
02:31:06,831 --> 02:31:08,060
I enjoyed it too much.

5233
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:11,270
And so the only way to do it was
to stop playing it all together.

5234
02:31:11,271 --> 02:31:14,780
And we started playing it again
recently after more than Shit,

5235
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:17,480
more than 15 years of
ever playing it at all,

5236
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:18,081
you know,

5237
02:31:18,081 --> 02:31:18,770
and uh,

5238
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:19,920
it's addictive,

5239
02:31:19,921 --> 02:31:21,180
but I'm so busy now,

5240
02:31:21,181 --> 02:31:23,010
I can't really fall into the grip of it.

5241
02:31:23,011 --> 02:31:25,290
I'm actually just enjoying
it for an hour here or there.

5242
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:26,090
But

5243
02:31:26,090 --> 02:31:26,190
Oh,

5244
02:31:26,190 --> 02:31:26,861
interesting in itself,

5245
02:31:26,861 --> 02:31:27,131
isn't it?

5246
02:31:27,131 --> 02:31:28,780
That's a bit like the rap part principle.

5247
02:31:28,781 --> 02:31:29,381
It feels to me,

5248
02:31:29,381 --> 02:31:30,214
correct me if I'm wrong,

5249
02:31:30,580 --> 02:31:31,413
that light,

5250
02:31:32,330 --> 02:31:34,190
the more you have in your life,

5251
02:31:34,610 --> 02:31:35,810
that is meaningful,

5252
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:37,670
that is good.

5253
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:40,040
Am gives you pleasure
or a sense of mastery,

5254
02:31:40,310 --> 02:31:44,330
the less space they will be for
these objects of obsessions come in.

5255
02:31:44,331 --> 02:31:45,110
Right.

5256
02:31:45,110 --> 02:31:46,370
And I think that is a principle.

5257
02:31:46,371 --> 02:31:47,204
That's true.

5258
02:31:47,210 --> 02:31:49,610
This was the principle behind the
Portuguese drug decriminalization,

5259
02:31:49,611 --> 02:31:50,270
right?

5260
02:31:50,270 --> 02:31:52,040
If we give people good lives,

5261
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:54,260
they will not want to
anesthetize themselves so much.

5262
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:57,830
It was the Swiss principle and I think
we all see that in our lives to different

5263
02:31:57,831 --> 02:31:58,520
degrees.

5264
02:31:58,520 --> 02:31:59,353
I,

5265
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:00,373
you know,

5266
02:32:02,860 --> 02:32:04,210
the happier I am,

5267
02:32:04,690 --> 02:32:06,820
the less I want to turn to,

5268
02:32:07,300 --> 02:32:07,720
uh,

5269
02:32:07,720 --> 02:32:08,110
you know,

5270
02:32:08,110 --> 02:32:12,640
the behaviors that I developed as a
child to avoid being present with like

5271
02:32:12,670 --> 02:32:13,540
violence and aggression.

5272
02:32:14,270 --> 02:32:15,103
Like

5273
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:18,460
I don't think of like
writing as an addiction.

5274
02:32:18,461 --> 02:32:20,580
It's might be a compulsion if I
have a day when I didn't do it,

5275
02:32:20,581 --> 02:32:21,221
I feel terrible.

5276
02:32:21,221 --> 02:32:24,190
But something that is
positive and rewarding,

5277
02:32:24,191 --> 02:32:26,170
I don't think is an addiction.

5278
02:32:26,210 --> 02:32:26,740
Right?

5279
02:32:26,740 --> 02:32:28,940
Something that enriches
your life and is not,

5280
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:30,580
it's a way of living life.

5281
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:32,380
The most fulfilling way.

5282
02:32:32,390 --> 02:32:33,320
Theme session,

5283
02:32:33,340 --> 02:32:34,690
maybe a positive obsession,

5284
02:32:35,410 --> 02:32:36,011
compulsion,

5285
02:32:36,011 --> 02:32:36,820
obsession,

5286
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:37,570
uh,

5287
02:32:37,570 --> 02:32:38,180
uh,

5288
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:39,670
a way of being in the world,

5289
02:32:39,671 --> 02:32:40,030
right?

5290
02:32:40,030 --> 02:32:41,200
Like I don't,

5291
02:32:41,470 --> 02:32:42,850
it's like sometimes I
get people saying to me,

5292
02:32:42,851 --> 02:32:43,091
you know,

5293
02:32:43,091 --> 02:32:43,331
like,

5294
02:32:43,331 --> 02:32:43,990
oh,

5295
02:32:43,990 --> 02:32:47,220
am I addicted to sex in or
whatever and you want to say it.

5296
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:47,711
I often say,

5297
02:32:47,711 --> 02:32:48,544
well,

5298
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:50,570
does it give you pleasure?

5299
02:32:51,410 --> 02:32:52,243
Does it,

5300
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:53,743
is it,

5301
02:32:54,460 --> 02:32:54,870
is it,

5302
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:57,880
and is it a way of avoiding pain if it
gives you pleasure and it's not a way of

5303
02:32:57,890 --> 02:32:58,920
avoiding pain is not an addiction.

5304
02:32:58,921 --> 02:32:59,670
It's just a way,

5305
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:00,990
a happy way of being in the world.

5306
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:01,650
Right?

5307
02:33:01,650 --> 02:33:02,940
And that's the reality for,

5308
02:33:03,690 --> 02:33:04,021
and again,

5309
02:33:04,021 --> 02:33:08,790
I think it's really helps us because
partly what I'm arguing in loss in Las

5310
02:33:08,791 --> 02:33:12,030
collection and chasing scream is we need
to deeply reconceptualize how we think

5311
02:33:12,031 --> 02:33:14,460
about these forms of pain
like depression and addiction.

5312
02:33:14,461 --> 02:33:15,680
And this isn't some wacky basis,

5313
02:33:15,690 --> 02:33:17,010
the view of the World Health Organization,

5314
02:33:17,011 --> 02:33:19,410
these leading medical bodies
when it comes to depression,

5315
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:21,330
the,

5316
02:33:21,330 --> 02:33:21,690
yeah,

5317
02:33:21,690 --> 02:33:22,523
sorry.

5318
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:27,450
People that are journalists and
writers often like stimulants,

5319
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:28,710
they often like Adderall.

5320
02:33:28,711 --> 02:33:30,930
Adderall is a big issue for,

5321
02:33:31,350 --> 02:33:31,710
for,

5322
02:33:31,710 --> 02:33:32,700
for journalists.

5323
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:34,590
How much experience do you have with that?

5324
02:33:34,591 --> 02:33:36,000
Are All I'm to be used it,

5325
02:33:36,300 --> 02:33:37,410
it's supposed to be amazing.

5326
02:33:37,530 --> 02:33:38,363
You need it.

5327
02:33:38,690 --> 02:33:40,820
Never used it precisely
because I know I would love it,

5328
02:33:40,970 --> 02:33:41,271
right?

5329
02:33:41,271 --> 02:33:42,200
Like I would,

5330
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:46,310
I've got a young relative
whose prescribed it and um,

5331
02:33:46,630 --> 02:33:49,400
that are the times when I've
been telling you he's a,

5332
02:33:49,401 --> 02:33:49,821
yeah,

5333
02:33:49,821 --> 02:33:50,480
he's offered,

5334
02:33:50,480 --> 02:33:52,310
tried to not spike me,

5335
02:33:52,311 --> 02:33:53,500
but like it's a joy to,

5336
02:33:54,080 --> 02:33:56,450
and this is for you,

5337
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:56,920
but you know,

5338
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:59,450
there's Adderall opens
up a whole other thing.

5339
02:33:59,451 --> 02:33:59,900
Right.

5340
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:02,330
Which is this what you're
talking about again,

5341
02:34:02,331 --> 02:34:04,730
which is I'm not against people,

5342
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:07,490
obviously not against people using
drugs in order to enhance their lives.

5343
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:08,810
And I have,

5344
02:34:09,170 --> 02:34:09,921
before I came here,

5345
02:34:09,921 --> 02:34:12,530
I drank enough caffeine to kill
a whole fucking field of cows.

5346
02:34:12,531 --> 02:34:13,100
Right?

5347
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:14,870
I assume viewers could probably tell,

5348
02:34:15,090 --> 02:34:15,620
um,

5349
02:34:15,620 --> 02:34:15,830
I,

5350
02:34:15,830 --> 02:34:16,663
I'm,

5351
02:34:16,670 --> 02:34:21,250
I limit my stimulant use because,

5352
02:34:21,580 --> 02:34:22,413
um,

5353
02:34:22,990 --> 02:34:26,590
because I know I can teach and
I can tell that I could easily,

5354
02:34:26,591 --> 02:34:28,960
a bit like we to beat the Modafinil
when I started using modafinil.

5355
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:29,561
I got that sense.

5356
02:34:29,561 --> 02:34:31,120
I just used it everyday for three months.

5357
02:34:31,121 --> 02:34:31,391
Right.

5358
02:34:31,391 --> 02:34:33,460
Which was ludicrous thing to do.

5359
02:34:33,880 --> 02:34:36,190
But um,

5360
02:34:37,030 --> 02:34:39,610
I think in terms of stimulants,

5361
02:34:39,611 --> 02:34:41,530
there's a whole debate
that needs to be had.

5362
02:34:41,531 --> 02:34:41,770
Now,

5363
02:34:41,770 --> 02:34:43,060
I'm going to write about
this at some point,

5364
02:34:43,061 --> 02:34:45,580
but one in 10,

5365
02:34:45,581 --> 02:34:50,110
13 year old boys in this country
is being given a stimulant drug,

5366
02:34:50,380 --> 02:34:50,890
right?

5367
02:34:50,890 --> 02:34:51,670
In any given year,

5368
02:34:51,670 --> 02:34:52,061
right?

5369
02:34:52,061 --> 02:34:54,700
For add or Adhd or,

5370
02:34:54,940 --> 02:34:55,300
I mean,

5371
02:34:55,300 --> 02:34:57,400
that is horrifying.

5372
02:34:57,430 --> 02:34:58,070
It's crazy.

5373
02:34:58,070 --> 02:34:58,300
Right?

5374
02:34:58,300 --> 02:35:01,120
30% of children in foster
care in the United States,

5375
02:35:01,121 --> 02:35:02,890
I've been given at least
one psychiatric drug.

5376
02:35:03,370 --> 02:35:05,860
These are not children
in the main who are,

5377
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:06,371
you know,

5378
02:35:06,371 --> 02:35:07,900
have some biological insanity.

5379
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:10,800
These are kids who've been fucking
abused and treated a bit smelly.

5380
02:35:10,801 --> 02:35:11,411
And what do we do?

5381
02:35:11,411 --> 02:35:12,610
We drug them to shut them up,

5382
02:35:12,611 --> 02:35:12,790
right?

5383
02:35:12,790 --> 02:35:12,940
Well,

5384
02:35:12,940 --> 02:35:17,080
it's also children have a lot of energy
and it's not easy to control them.

5385
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:20,500
And so they decide that these children
have something wrong with them.

5386
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:20,921
Do you know,

5387
02:35:20,921 --> 02:35:22,810
I went to this Amish
village Veloce connections,

5388
02:35:22,811 --> 02:35:23,860
but one thing that was really interesting,

5389
02:35:24,220 --> 02:35:26,470
there are these people who argued there
needs to be more research on this,

5390
02:35:26,471 --> 02:35:28,750
but Amish children don't get ADHD.

5391
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:29,081
Right?

5392
02:35:29,081 --> 02:35:30,580
And this is big debate
what's going on there.

5393
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:33,880
And so this one argument,

5394
02:35:33,881 --> 02:35:36,520
which is then obviously not
exposed to digital media,

5395
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:37,413
which may,

5396
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:40,120
and there's some evidence of just
speaking to professor Steven Lee here,

5397
02:35:40,121 --> 02:35:43,390
but people are getting a lot loads of
ADHD when I was in school and they're

5398
02:35:43,430 --> 02:35:43,861
exactly.

5399
02:35:43,861 --> 02:35:44,121
So,

5400
02:35:44,121 --> 02:35:44,501
exactly.

5401
02:35:44,501 --> 02:35:45,330
So that's,

5402
02:35:45,330 --> 02:35:47,260
that's just because I
spoke to guy at Ucla,

5403
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:48,160
Professor Stephen Asian.

5404
02:35:48,161 --> 02:35:49,390
There's some effect of digital media,

5405
02:35:49,391 --> 02:35:50,111
but it's not massive.

5406
02:35:50,111 --> 02:35:50,291
Right?

5407
02:35:50,291 --> 02:35:50,860
Right.

5408
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:51,693
Um,

5409
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:54,310
I think what's happening from the
very small amount of research you,

5410
02:35:54,311 --> 02:35:56,260
you're talking to the Amish is,

5411
02:35:56,290 --> 02:35:56,500
you know,

5412
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:57,101
I'd say to them,

5413
02:35:57,101 --> 02:35:58,570
do you have kids who
don't want to sit still?

5414
02:35:58,990 --> 02:35:59,650
And they go,

5415
02:35:59,650 --> 02:36:00,130
yeah,

5416
02:36:00,130 --> 02:36:01,210
we'll let them go golf and go fishing.

5417
02:36:01,510 --> 02:36:01,780
Right?

5418
02:36:01,780 --> 02:36:04,270
The Amish don't want to make you
sit still for eight hours a day,

5419
02:36:04,290 --> 02:36:04,870
right?

5420
02:36:04,870 --> 02:36:07,160
There's nothing in their
society that I'm not idealizing.

5421
02:36:07,161 --> 02:36:10,440
The Amish has problems with getting a
child to sit still for eight hours a day,

5422
02:36:10,990 --> 02:36:13,540
just like trying to get a puppy to
sit still for eight hours a day.

5423
02:36:13,541 --> 02:36:13,961
Exactly.

5424
02:36:13,961 --> 02:36:15,130
That's exactly the right analogy.

5425
02:36:15,131 --> 02:36:16,900
What we do to our children.

5426
02:36:17,950 --> 02:36:22,950
We try to deaden them and discipline
them to cope and thrive in a dead end and

5427
02:36:24,761 --> 02:36:26,290
disciplines and inverted commerce economy.

5428
02:36:26,291 --> 02:36:26,950
Right?

5429
02:36:26,950 --> 02:36:27,783
If you,

5430
02:36:28,070 --> 02:36:31,120
the school system was designed in the
1870s to prepare people to work in

5431
02:36:31,121 --> 02:36:31,691
factories,

5432
02:36:31,691 --> 02:36:32,380
right?

5433
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:34,270
If you're going to work
in a factory in the 1870s,

5434
02:36:34,271 --> 02:36:34,990
what do you need?

5435
02:36:34,990 --> 02:36:36,400
You need to learn to shut the fuck up,

5436
02:36:36,970 --> 02:36:37,803
not complain,

5437
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:38,793
be passive.

5438
02:36:38,950 --> 02:36:39,790
Do what you're told.

5439
02:36:39,970 --> 02:36:40,520
Right?

5440
02:36:40,520 --> 02:36:40,720
It,

5441
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:41,111
this is,

5442
02:36:41,111 --> 02:36:41,944
um,

5443
02:36:42,510 --> 02:36:44,150
I think it's a guy called Alfred cone.

5444
02:36:44,630 --> 02:36:48,190
I think it's him who says every school
has two curriculums or curricular over

5445
02:36:48,191 --> 02:36:50,500
the pluralists you've got
the official curriculum,

5446
02:36:50,501 --> 02:36:52,210
which is like geography,

5447
02:36:52,211 --> 02:36:52,631
history,

5448
02:36:52,631 --> 02:36:53,464
whatever.

5449
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:55,150
And then you have the hidden curriculum,

5450
02:36:55,420 --> 02:36:58,900
which is the kind of person the
school is trying to make you into.

5451
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:00,033
Right?

5452
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:03,490
And what is the school system designed
to base designed to make people who are

5453
02:37:03,491 --> 02:37:04,324
passive,

5454
02:37:04,690 --> 02:37:05,523
who are,

5455
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:06,610
uh,

5456
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:07,443
obedient,

5457
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:10,660
who sit still and shut
the fuck up right now.

5458
02:37:10,661 --> 02:37:12,490
That was never a good way to make humans,

5459
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:12,821
right?

5460
02:37:12,821 --> 02:37:14,110
That was always wrong.

5461
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:16,490
But it's particularly awful in the,

5462
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:16,791
you know,

5463
02:37:16,791 --> 02:37:17,930
the culture we created.

5464
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:18,980
But,

5465
02:37:18,980 --> 02:37:21,800
and this relates to one of the causes
of depression that I write about in Los

5466
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:21,801
Connections,

5467
02:37:21,801 --> 02:37:22,520
which is,

5468
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:23,353
you know,

5469
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:24,080
it's really good.

5470
02:37:24,080 --> 02:37:26,600
I know it's the loads of the people
I know who are depressed and anxious.

5471
02:37:26,930 --> 02:37:29,240
Their depression and anxiety
focuses around their work.

5472
02:37:29,241 --> 02:37:30,051
We talked about this last time.

5473
02:37:30,051 --> 02:37:30,884
I was on a thing,

5474
02:37:31,100 --> 02:37:31,690
um,

5475
02:37:31,690 --> 02:37:32,091
but I was like,

5476
02:37:32,091 --> 02:37:32,900
okay,

5477
02:37:32,900 --> 02:37:33,201
people,

5478
02:37:33,201 --> 02:37:33,651
I know,

5479
02:37:33,651 --> 02:37:34,580
maybe they're unusual,

5480
02:37:34,581 --> 02:37:35,330
right?

5481
02:37:35,330 --> 02:37:36,740
So start to look at the evidence base.

5482
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:39,710
Gallup did a really big study
of people in the U S and Europe.

5483
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:40,251
See,

5484
02:37:40,251 --> 02:37:41,660
what do people feel about their work?

5485
02:37:41,661 --> 02:37:42,494
Right?

5486
02:37:43,400 --> 02:37:44,990
13% of people,

5487
02:37:44,991 --> 02:37:45,231
one,

5488
02:37:45,231 --> 02:37:46,970
3% like their work,

5489
02:37:46,971 --> 02:37:47,804
most of the time,

5490
02:37:48,380 --> 02:37:51,260
63% of what they called sleep working,

5491
02:37:51,710 --> 02:37:51,951
you know,

5492
02:37:51,951 --> 02:37:52,281
like it,

5493
02:37:52,281 --> 02:37:52,791
you don't hate it.

5494
02:37:52,791 --> 02:37:53,690
You kind of tolerate it.

5495
02:37:54,230 --> 02:37:56,990
And 24% of people fucking
hate and fear their jobs.

5496
02:37:57,630 --> 02:37:58,790
And so you think about that,

5497
02:37:58,940 --> 02:38:03,200
that means 87% of people don't like the
thing they're doing most of the time.

5498
02:38:03,380 --> 02:38:03,471
Now,

5499
02:38:03,471 --> 02:38:05,690
that can't be far off what the
figure was in the Soviet Union,

5500
02:38:05,691 --> 02:38:05,871
right?

5501
02:38:05,871 --> 02:38:07,010
That's a really extreme,

5502
02:38:07,011 --> 02:38:07,660
bigger.

5503
02:38:07,660 --> 02:38:08,493
Um,

5504
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:09,463
and I'm like,

5505
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:10,820
so I'm looking at this,

5506
02:38:11,270 --> 02:38:11,631
I'm thinking,

5507
02:38:11,631 --> 02:38:11,900
okay,

5508
02:38:11,900 --> 02:38:14,930
could this bear some relationship
to our mental health crisis,

5509
02:38:14,931 --> 02:38:15,530
right?

5510
02:38:15,530 --> 02:38:19,400
This thing that we don't like is
spreading over more and more of our day.

5511
02:38:19,401 --> 02:38:21,290
The average person I think
answers the first email,

5512
02:38:21,291 --> 02:38:24,650
I think it's 7:43 AM and
leaves work at 7:15 PM right?

5513
02:38:24,670 --> 02:38:28,130
W and I learned this in an amazing
Australian social scientists or went to

5514
02:38:28,131 --> 02:38:31,250
interview call professor Michael Marmot
who discovered the key factor that

5515
02:38:31,251 --> 02:38:32,360
causes depression at work,

5516
02:38:32,361 --> 02:38:33,194
right?

5517
02:38:33,380 --> 02:38:33,951
If you go to,

5518
02:38:33,951 --> 02:38:34,680
it's not the only one,

5519
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:35,513
but key factor.

5520
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:40,750
If you go to work tomorrow and you are
controlled so you have low or no control

5521
02:38:40,971 --> 02:38:44,060
over your work are much more likely
to become depressed and anxious.

5522
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:45,620
I think it relates to what we've
been talking about all along.

5523
02:38:45,621 --> 02:38:46,940
People have psychological needs.

5524
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:48,200
You need to feel you're good at something,

5525
02:38:48,201 --> 02:38:49,034
you need to build.

5526
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:50,570
Your life has meaning.

5527
02:38:51,290 --> 02:38:52,400
If you're controlled all the time,

5528
02:38:52,401 --> 02:38:53,210
you can't feel that.

5529
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:54,043
Right.

5530
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:55,340
So when I first learned this,

5531
02:38:55,341 --> 02:38:59,780
I remember first time I went
to see professor [inaudible]
like misunderstanding

5532
02:38:59,781 --> 02:39:03,410
the implications of this cause
I thought he was saying wrongly,

5533
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:04,430
I thought he'd be saying,

5534
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:05,151
okay,

5535
02:39:05,151 --> 02:39:08,720
you've got this 13% of elite people at
the top like you have me who get to have

5536
02:39:08,721 --> 02:39:11,960
jobs we love and then you've got
everyone else's condemned to the shit.

5537
02:39:11,960 --> 02:39:12,150
Right.

5538
02:39:12,150 --> 02:39:12,891
I thought about my family.

5539
02:39:12,891 --> 02:39:14,150
My brother is an Uber driver.

5540
02:39:14,151 --> 02:39:14,660
My,

5541
02:39:14,660 --> 02:39:15,770
my dad was a bus driver,

5542
02:39:15,771 --> 02:39:16,970
my grandmother cleaned toilets.

5543
02:39:16,971 --> 02:39:17,151
I'm like,

5544
02:39:17,151 --> 02:39:17,540
wait,

5545
02:39:17,540 --> 02:39:20,180
are we saying they're just
condemned to these miserable lives?

5546
02:39:20,181 --> 02:39:23,210
And explained to me it's not the
work that makes you depressed,

5547
02:39:23,211 --> 02:39:23,421
right?

5548
02:39:23,421 --> 02:39:26,450
He's being controlled at work
and there are solutions to that.

5549
02:39:26,451 --> 02:39:27,620
There are changes we can make.

5550
02:39:27,621 --> 02:39:28,320
Right.

5551
02:39:28,320 --> 02:39:28,630
Um,

5552
02:39:28,630 --> 02:39:33,620
I went to interview this woman
called Meredith Keough in Baltimore.

5553
02:39:33,830 --> 02:39:35,600
It's been part of this
really interesting change.

5554
02:39:35,810 --> 02:39:38,090
And sometimes some people listening are
going to think I'm going to say they

5555
02:39:38,091 --> 02:39:39,680
should do this and they
don't think I can't do that.

5556
02:39:39,681 --> 02:39:40,101
And it's right.

5557
02:39:40,101 --> 02:39:41,210
This is an argument or something else.

5558
02:39:41,510 --> 02:39:43,730
So Meredith used to go to
bed every Sunday night,

5559
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:45,590
just sick with anxiety,

5560
02:39:45,591 --> 02:39:46,260
right?

5561
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:46,730
Uh,

5562
02:39:46,730 --> 02:39:47,720
she had an office job.

5563
02:39:47,721 --> 02:39:50,000
It wasn't the worst office job in
the world as she would tell Ya.

5564
02:39:50,420 --> 02:39:52,280
She wasn't being bullied
or harassed or anything,

5565
02:39:52,281 --> 02:39:54,020
but it was boring.

5566
02:39:54,050 --> 02:39:54,950
It was controlled.

5567
02:39:54,951 --> 02:39:56,360
Couldn't just stand the thought.

5568
02:39:56,750 --> 02:39:59,360
This was going to be the
next 40 years of her life.

5569
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:00,860
So one day with her husband,

5570
02:40:00,861 --> 02:40:02,570
Josh Meredith did this quite bold thing.

5571
02:40:03,070 --> 02:40:03,350
Uh,

5572
02:40:03,350 --> 02:40:03,831
Josh,

5573
02:40:03,831 --> 02:40:07,670
her husband had been working in bike
stores since he was a kid in Baltimore,

5574
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:11,180
teenager and you know that's
controlled work is insecure.

5575
02:40:11,181 --> 02:40:12,920
You don't even have rights really.

5576
02:40:13,410 --> 02:40:16,440
And one day Josh and his colleagues in
the bike store and they ask themselves,

5577
02:40:17,130 --> 02:40:18,510
what does our boss actually do?

5578
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:20,131
They liked their boss.

5579
02:40:20,131 --> 02:40:20,970
He wasn't a bad person,

5580
02:40:20,971 --> 02:40:21,301
but they were like,

5581
02:40:21,301 --> 02:40:23,430
we seem to fix all the bikes and
he seems to make all the money.

5582
02:40:23,431 --> 02:40:24,900
This doesn't seem like
such a good deal to me.

5583
02:40:24,901 --> 02:40:25,530
Right.

5584
02:40:25,530 --> 02:40:28,410
So they decided they were going to set
up a bike store that works on different

5585
02:40:28,411 --> 02:40:28,861
principle,

5586
02:40:28,861 --> 02:40:29,310
right.

5587
02:40:29,310 --> 02:40:31,320
The place they work before
it was a corporation.

5588
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:34,050
Most people listening to your
show work in corporations.

5589
02:40:34,051 --> 02:40:36,300
You know how it's a very
recent human invention.

5590
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:37,950
You know how it works as an army.

5591
02:40:38,220 --> 02:40:40,080
The boss at the top is
like the little dictator.

5592
02:40:40,081 --> 02:40:41,250
You've got to obey him or leave,

5593
02:40:41,251 --> 02:40:41,431
right.

5594
02:40:41,431 --> 02:40:44,400
And sometimes he's a nice dictator
and sometimes he's Kim Jong Un,

5595
02:40:44,401 --> 02:40:44,701
but you know,

5596
02:40:44,701 --> 02:40:45,600
you don't have much say over that.

5597
02:40:45,601 --> 02:40:46,434
Right.

5598
02:40:48,090 --> 02:40:51,120
Josh and his colleagues decided to set
up a bank store that works on a different

5599
02:40:51,121 --> 02:40:51,954
principle.

5600
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:53,130
It's not a corporation,

5601
02:40:53,131 --> 02:40:54,420
it's a democratic cooperative.

5602
02:40:54,630 --> 02:40:57,240
So they don't have a boss.

5603
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:58,770
They run the business together,

5604
02:40:58,771 --> 02:41:00,090
they take decisions about it together.

5605
02:41:00,091 --> 02:41:02,100
They have a meeting once every
couple of weeks in practice.

5606
02:41:02,101 --> 02:41:02,491
They agree,

5607
02:41:02,491 --> 02:41:03,241
but you know,

5608
02:41:03,241 --> 02:41:04,440
sometimes they don't and then they vote,

5609
02:41:04,890 --> 02:41:06,120
they share the profits,

5610
02:41:06,450 --> 02:41:08,940
they share out the good
tasks and the shitty tasks.

5611
02:41:09,330 --> 02:41:10,163
Um,

5612
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:11,760
and one thing that was
so interesting to me,

5613
02:41:11,761 --> 02:41:13,520
their businesses called
Baltimore bicycle work,

5614
02:41:13,521 --> 02:41:16,980
spending time with them totally
in line with professor moments.

5615
02:41:16,981 --> 02:41:17,850
Findings is,

5616
02:41:19,160 --> 02:41:19,993
you know,

5617
02:41:20,430 --> 02:41:24,720
giving them back control over their
work made the much less unhappy,

5618
02:41:24,721 --> 02:41:25,201
depressed,

5619
02:41:25,201 --> 02:41:25,741
and anxious.

5620
02:41:25,741 --> 02:41:26,340
Right?

5621
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:27,420
And it's not like,

5622
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:27,991
you know,

5623
02:41:27,991 --> 02:41:31,140
they quit their jobs fixing bikes and
went off to become Beyonce is backing

5624
02:41:31,141 --> 02:41:31,501
singers,

5625
02:41:31,501 --> 02:41:32,070
right?

5626
02:41:32,070 --> 02:41:33,930
They fix bikes before they fixed bikes.

5627
02:41:33,930 --> 02:41:34,920
Now differences.

5628
02:41:34,921 --> 02:41:36,630
Now they've got control over their work,

5629
02:41:36,631 --> 02:41:37,290
right?

5630
02:41:37,290 --> 02:41:41,520
Giving people back control over their
work is a really powerful antidepressant

5631
02:41:41,790 --> 02:41:43,890
that every corporation could be,

5632
02:41:43,950 --> 02:41:45,450
could be a democratic cooperative.

5633
02:41:45,451 --> 02:41:45,840
Right?

5634
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:47,310
That's a big change in our society.

5635
02:41:47,311 --> 02:41:47,641
But it's,

5636
02:41:47,641 --> 02:41:47,790
you know,

5637
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:50,070
we've all lived through
big changes in our society.

5638
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:51,330
There's no reason,

5639
02:41:52,210 --> 02:41:52,531
by the way,

5640
02:41:52,531 --> 02:41:53,730
it would be better for the economy.

5641
02:41:53,780 --> 02:41:54,060
Uh,

5642
02:41:54,060 --> 02:41:58,020
study at Cornell University found
democratic workplaces grow on average four

5643
02:41:58,021 --> 02:42:01,290
times faster than non
democratic workplaces because
people are more committed.

5644
02:42:01,291 --> 02:42:04,860
They bringing more of their energy
and their life to it that the,

5645
02:42:06,910 --> 02:42:09,190
we've got to understand Chris,

5646
02:42:09,191 --> 02:42:10,720
back to why the addiction is so bad.

5647
02:42:10,721 --> 02:42:10,811
It's,

5648
02:42:10,811 --> 02:42:15,811
we can understand people who are
showing these signs of distress,

5649
02:42:16,750 --> 02:42:17,440
depression,

5650
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:18,130
anxiety,

5651
02:42:18,130 --> 02:42:18,963
addiction,

5652
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:22,990
that they're doing that
not because they're crazy.

5653
02:42:23,020 --> 02:42:25,330
There are some biological
factors that are not rational,

5654
02:42:25,750 --> 02:42:30,750
but mostly it's just actually we built a
society that's not good for them and we

5655
02:42:31,601 --> 02:42:35,400
should be listening to that and
respecting that and like the guy doctor in

5656
02:42:35,410 --> 02:42:36,131
Vietnam said to me,

5657
02:42:36,131 --> 02:42:37,210
listen to your nausea.

5658
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:38,860
It will tell us what's wrong with you.

5659
02:42:39,010 --> 02:42:43,690
We should be listening to their nausea
and using it as a kind of fuel to change,

5660
02:42:44,110 --> 02:42:48,330
change the way we live in ways that will
make or won't just make people who are

5661
02:42:48,331 --> 02:42:49,450
depressed and anxious and addictive.

5662
02:42:49,451 --> 02:42:52,300
Better off everyone's life will be better
off if they control their work more.

5663
02:42:52,301 --> 02:42:54,820
If you go through some of the
other big solutions to depression,

5664
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:56,080
anxiety that I wrote about in,

5665
02:42:56,410 --> 02:42:57,340
in Las connections.

5666
02:42:58,060 --> 02:43:00,520
Now lost connections is
your most recent book.

5667
02:43:00,550 --> 02:43:00,761
Yeah.

5668
02:43:00,761 --> 02:43:01,600
That's the one about depression.

5669
02:43:01,601 --> 02:43:02,320
Is that Audi?

5670
02:43:02,320 --> 02:43:02,650
Yeah.

5671
02:43:02,650 --> 02:43:02,800
Yeah.

5672
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:03,490
They're both available.

5673
02:43:03,490 --> 02:43:04,090
Yeah.

5674
02:43:04,090 --> 02:43:05,650
Now lost connections.

5675
02:43:06,310 --> 02:43:07,960
How did the two of them tie together?

5676
02:43:08,440 --> 02:43:11,080
So I wrote chasing the scream because
of this addiction in my family.

5677
02:43:11,890 --> 02:43:15,250
And I go on this big journey all over
the world to understand the drug war.

5678
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:17,950
And I set a line in my,

5679
02:43:17,980 --> 02:43:19,840
I did a Ted talk about it called a,

5680
02:43:19,870 --> 02:43:21,520
everything you think you know
about addiction is wrong.

5681
02:43:22,090 --> 02:43:23,380
And I said a line in that,

5682
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:24,910
which is the opposite of
addiction is connection.

5683
02:43:24,911 --> 02:43:26,440
I said earlier in our conversation

5684
02:43:28,390 --> 02:43:29,470
based on rat park,

5685
02:43:29,471 --> 02:43:29,770
right.

5686
02:43:29,770 --> 02:43:31,540
And lots of people started saying to me,

5687
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:33,451
well,

5688
02:43:33,451 --> 02:43:35,550
are you just saying it's social isolation,

5689
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:36,420
right?

5690
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:37,470
Like loneliness.

5691
02:43:37,860 --> 02:43:39,150
And I very clearly in my moment,

5692
02:43:39,180 --> 02:43:39,391
no,

5693
02:43:39,391 --> 02:43:41,070
I don't think that's
the lesson of rat park.

5694
02:43:41,071 --> 02:43:41,400
Right?

5695
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:43,140
I don't think that's just
what's going on in rat park.

5696
02:43:43,141 --> 02:43:43,261
It's,

5697
02:43:43,261 --> 02:43:45,570
they don't have anything
that makes life meaningful.

5698
02:43:45,870 --> 02:43:47,490
Now Rats obviously much more,

5699
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:49,710
much less complex than ours.

5700
02:43:49,740 --> 02:43:50,550
Right.

5701
02:43:50,550 --> 02:43:51,420
So I started thinking,

5702
02:43:51,421 --> 02:43:51,780
well,

5703
02:43:51,780 --> 02:43:52,613
what,

5704
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:56,840
what is actually missing
for people who are addicted,

5705
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:57,793
depressed,

5706
02:43:58,070 --> 02:43:58,521
anxious,

5707
02:43:58,521 --> 02:44:00,200
what is driving this crisis?

5708
02:44:00,350 --> 02:44:02,540
So I think that question
that people kept asking me,

5709
02:44:02,690 --> 02:44:06,440
I could see the Portugal and Switzerland
had dealt with some problems of

5710
02:44:06,441 --> 02:44:06,981
disconnection,

5711
02:44:06,981 --> 02:44:08,390
but you weren't quite rightly
to think more question,

5712
02:44:08,391 --> 02:44:08,900
which,

5713
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:10,310
what did Switzerland deal with?

5714
02:44:10,311 --> 02:44:10,571
Right.

5715
02:44:10,571 --> 02:44:11,720
That I couldn't quite,

5716
02:44:11,721 --> 02:44:14,180
I didn't quite ask cause it didn't quite
understand when I was in Switzerland.

5717
02:44:14,420 --> 02:44:18,170
So I ended up again going on this big
journey all over the world from a crazy

5718
02:44:18,171 --> 02:44:21,110
mixture of places like an Amish village
in Indiana because the Amish have low

5719
02:44:21,111 --> 02:44:25,290
levels of depression to a lab in
Baltimore where they're giving people suck

5720
02:44:25,291 --> 02:44:30,291
Adele links to your city in Brazil that
banned advertising to see if that would

5721
02:44:30,831 --> 02:44:31,700
make them feel better.

5722
02:44:32,150 --> 02:44:32,983
Did it?

5723
02:44:33,290 --> 02:44:34,123
Which bear?

5724
02:44:34,130 --> 02:44:34,841
Banning advertising.

5725
02:44:34,841 --> 02:44:35,560
Yeah.

5726
02:44:35,560 --> 02:44:36,050
Yeah.

5727
02:44:36,050 --> 02:44:37,820
So that's not been properly
scientifically studied,

5728
02:44:37,821 --> 02:44:40,400
but there is a science that tells
us it should explain what that is.

5729
02:44:40,730 --> 02:44:41,563
So this is,

5730
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:45,500
everyone knows that junk food is taken
over our diets and made us physically

5731
02:44:45,501 --> 02:44:45,771
sick,

5732
02:44:45,771 --> 02:44:46,041
right?

5733
02:44:46,041 --> 02:44:48,380
But there's this really
interesting evidence,

5734
02:44:49,180 --> 02:44:53,450
the kind of junk values of taken over
our minds and made us mentally sick.

5735
02:44:53,630 --> 02:44:55,100
So to thousands of years,

5736
02:44:55,310 --> 02:44:56,450
philosophers have said,

5737
02:44:56,750 --> 02:45:01,610
if you think life is about money and
status and how you look to other people in

5738
02:45:01,611 --> 02:45:02,720
a kind of showing off way,

5739
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:04,070
you're going to feel like shit,

5740
02:45:04,071 --> 02:45:04,340
right?

5741
02:45:04,340 --> 02:45:05,810
It's not an exact quote from Confucius,

5742
02:45:05,811 --> 02:45:07,070
but that is the gist of what he said,

5743
02:45:07,071 --> 02:45:07,880
right?

5744
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:08,810
But weirdly,

5745
02:45:09,260 --> 02:45:13,040
nobody had ever scientifically
investigated this until an incredible guy.

5746
02:45:13,041 --> 02:45:16,610
I got to know cut professor
Tim [inaudible] who's at
Knox College in Illinois,

5747
02:45:17,320 --> 02:45:17,590
um,

5748
02:45:17,590 --> 02:45:18,550
and Professor Cassa,

5749
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,250
uh,

5750
02:45:19,250 --> 02:45:22,610
made some really important
breakthroughs in this.

5751
02:45:22,790 --> 02:45:23,623
So

5752
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:30,460
there's two ways everyone listening to
your show has two kinds of motivation in

5753
02:45:30,681 --> 02:45:31,100
their life,

5754
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:31,550
right?

5755
02:45:31,550 --> 02:45:32,630
We're all a mixture of both.

5756
02:45:32,990 --> 02:45:36,620
So imagine if you played the piano in
the morning cause you love playing the

5757
02:45:36,621 --> 02:45:36,951
piano.

5758
02:45:36,951 --> 02:45:37,730
It gives you joy,

5759
02:45:37,730 --> 02:45:38,563
right?

5760
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:41,330
That would be what's called an
intrinsic reason to play the piano,

5761
02:45:41,331 --> 02:45:41,601
right?

5762
02:45:41,601 --> 02:45:42,950
You're not doing it to
get anything out of it.

5763
02:45:42,951 --> 02:45:43,341
That's just,

5764
02:45:43,341 --> 02:45:44,180
that's the thing you love.

5765
02:45:44,181 --> 02:45:44,301
Right?

5766
02:45:44,301 --> 02:45:47,420
It sounds like Jujitsu was like that
view writing is like that for me.

5767
02:45:47,421 --> 02:45:50,600
Everyone will have something in their
life that just gives them joy as they do

5768
02:45:50,601 --> 02:45:50,780
it.

5769
02:45:50,780 --> 02:45:51,470
Right.

5770
02:45:51,470 --> 02:45:53,180
Can narrow imagine you played the piano,

5771
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:54,313
not,

5772
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:55,790
I dunno not because you love it,

5773
02:45:55,791 --> 02:45:58,940
but because your parents are
massively pressuring you.

5774
02:45:58,941 --> 02:46:02,750
It's their dream for you or in a dive
bar that you can't stand to pay the rent

5775
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:04,610
or cuts impress a woman.

5776
02:46:04,730 --> 02:46:05,390
Right.

5777
02:46:05,390 --> 02:46:08,240
That would be what's called an
extrinsic reasons to play the piano.

5778
02:46:08,270 --> 02:46:08,720
Right?

5779
02:46:08,720 --> 02:46:10,130
You're not it cause that thing gives

5780
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:10,371
you joy.

5781
02:46:10,371 --> 02:46:12,080
You're doing it to get
something further down the line.

5782
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:14,240
Right now obviously we're
all a mixture of both,

5783
02:46:14,510 --> 02:46:16,970
but professor castle showed a
couple of really interesting things.

5784
02:46:17,420 --> 02:46:18,253
Firstly,

5785
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:21,380
the more you are driven
by extrinsic values,

5786
02:46:21,381 --> 02:46:23,390
the more your intrinsic
values are starved,

5787
02:46:23,900 --> 02:46:26,060
the more likely you are to
become depressed and anxious,

5788
02:46:26,061 --> 02:46:27,530
but quite significant amount.

5789
02:46:28,190 --> 02:46:30,350
He also showed as a culture,

5790
02:46:30,530 --> 02:46:31,640
as a society,

5791
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,760
we have become much more
driven by these junk values.

5792
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:35,370
Right?

5793
02:46:35,370 --> 02:46:38,870
We've become much more driven by pick
about how Instagram makes you feel.

5794
02:46:38,871 --> 02:46:39,171
Sure.

5795
02:46:39,171 --> 02:46:39,740
Right?

5796
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:44,160
We've become much more driven by
this hollow external sense of it.

5797
02:46:44,460 --> 02:46:45,770
Think about something as simple as,

5798
02:46:46,070 --> 02:46:46,330
well,

5799
02:46:46,330 --> 02:46:47,163
a while ago,

5800
02:46:47,220 --> 02:46:47,450
uh,

5801
02:46:47,450 --> 02:46:50,060
I was the Elton John's last
night in Caesar's palace,

5802
02:46:50,061 --> 02:46:50,360
right?

5803
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:51,470
Amazing thing to be at.

5804
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:53,540
And about half the fucking room is,

5805
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:55,540
is filming it on that
isn't even looking out.

5806
02:46:55,550 --> 02:46:56,150
And John,

5807
02:46:56,150 --> 02:46:57,590
they're just watching
it through their phone.

5808
02:46:57,740 --> 02:46:57,861
Now,

5809
02:46:57,861 --> 02:46:59,090
that's a small example,

5810
02:46:59,270 --> 02:47:02,750
but you can see what they're doing
in order to display their life,

5811
02:47:02,751 --> 02:47:04,580
to invite envy from other people.

5812
02:47:04,970 --> 02:47:06,320
They are not living their life.

5813
02:47:06,500 --> 02:47:08,450
No one wants to watch
your shitty video about.

5814
02:47:08,451 --> 02:47:09,050
And John,

5815
02:47:09,050 --> 02:47:11,020
there's a hundred thousands of,

5816
02:47:11,220 --> 02:47:11,450
uh,

5817
02:47:11,450 --> 02:47:12,231
of videos about,

5818
02:47:12,231 --> 02:47:12,501
and John,

5819
02:47:12,501 --> 02:47:13,430
they are much better than yours,

5820
02:47:13,431 --> 02:47:13,970
right?

5821
02:47:13,970 --> 02:47:14,840
Why are you doing that?

5822
02:47:14,841 --> 02:47:15,950
You're never going to watch it either.

5823
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:17,690
You're doing it to say to other people,

5824
02:47:17,900 --> 02:47:18,710
envy me,

5825
02:47:18,710 --> 02:47:19,160
right?

5826
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:22,160
It doesn't make you feel good in that
room actually makes you feel worse.

5827
02:47:22,161 --> 02:47:25,710
You're not enjoying the experience and
it makes them feel like shit because

5828
02:47:25,960 --> 02:47:27,980
you're trying to invite
envy and your friends.

5829
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:33,170
That's a small example of a much wider
thing of the kind of junk values of

5830
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,730
technologies.

5831
02:47:33,730 --> 02:47:37,310
So the reason that relates to what
you're asking about Brazil is professor

5832
02:47:37,311 --> 02:47:41,750
castle are shown those two
sets of solutions to these
junk values taken over our

5833
02:47:41,751 --> 02:47:42,380
minds.

5834
02:47:42,380 --> 02:47:43,213
One is,

5835
02:47:43,250 --> 02:47:44,540
it's like fucking air pollution,

5836
02:47:44,750 --> 02:47:45,530
you know,

5837
02:47:45,530 --> 02:47:46,970
get the messaging out of your head.

5838
02:47:47,150 --> 02:47:51,290
More 18 month old children know
what the Mcdonald's m means,

5839
02:47:51,650 --> 02:47:52,850
the know their own survey,

5840
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:53,720
their own last name,

5841
02:47:53,960 --> 02:47:54,520
right?

5842
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:55,353
Um,

5843
02:47:55,730 --> 02:47:58,790
from the moment it's professor [inaudible]
put it to me from the moment we're

5844
02:47:58,791 --> 02:47:59,570
born,

5845
02:47:59,570 --> 02:48:03,410
we're immersed in a machine that is
designed to get us to neglect what is

5846
02:48:03,411 --> 02:48:04,640
important about life,

5847
02:48:04,790 --> 02:48:05,390
right?

5848
02:48:05,390 --> 02:48:09,680
None of your listeners will lie on their
death beds and think about all the shit

5849
02:48:09,681 --> 02:48:11,840
they bought and all the
likes they got an Instagram.

5850
02:48:11,841 --> 02:48:13,430
They'll think about moments
and meaning and connection.

5851
02:48:13,431 --> 02:48:14,241
That's like a banal,

5852
02:48:14,241 --> 02:48:15,074
obvious thing,

5853
02:48:15,170 --> 02:48:18,650
but we're constantly pushed
to not think in those terms,

5854
02:48:18,651 --> 02:48:19,430
to think about,

5855
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:21,290
show it off by spend,

5856
02:48:21,320 --> 02:48:21,830
right?

5857
02:48:21,830 --> 02:48:24,110
These junk values have
taken over our minds.

5858
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:27,620
So part of the solution is just fucking
get rid of most of this advertising,

5859
02:48:27,621 --> 02:48:28,880
get rid of most of this,

5860
02:48:29,030 --> 02:48:29,330
you know,

5861
02:48:29,330 --> 02:48:30,900
very tightly regulated.

5862
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:32,900
But in doing so,

5863
02:48:32,901 --> 02:48:34,070
you limit commerce,

5864
02:48:34,071 --> 02:48:37,130
you're limiting people's
ability to sell things.

5865
02:48:37,330 --> 02:48:37,710
You're,

5866
02:48:37,710 --> 02:48:38,860
you're changing the,

5867
02:48:38,861 --> 02:48:41,480
the current market that a lot of
people don't have any problem with.

5868
02:48:41,720 --> 02:48:43,550
I know this is a heresy
in the United States,

5869
02:48:43,551 --> 02:48:45,950
but I limits in commercial
speech is fine by me.

5870
02:48:45,951 --> 02:48:46,190
Yeah,

5871
02:48:46,190 --> 02:48:46,330
I've,

5872
02:48:46,330 --> 02:48:47,450
I think it's fascinating.

5873
02:48:47,451 --> 02:48:49,280
I think it's a fascinating
discussion but it is in the,

5874
02:48:49,281 --> 02:48:51,230
in a sense it's limiting
free speech as well.

5875
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:51,620
I mean,

5876
02:48:51,620 --> 02:48:53,060
and we have a real problem with that.

5877
02:48:53,360 --> 02:48:56,930
The problem with it is that as soon as
you start to put any regulations at all

5878
02:48:57,140 --> 02:48:57,711
and you know,

5879
02:48:57,711 --> 02:48:58,101
he say,

5880
02:48:58,101 --> 02:48:58,251
Oh,

5881
02:48:58,251 --> 02:49:00,770
you shouldn't be allowed to
advertising to advertise,

5882
02:49:00,771 --> 02:49:01,820
even if it's advertising.

5883
02:49:01,850 --> 02:49:04,790
Honestly about a great
product that people were,

5884
02:49:04,791 --> 02:49:06,380
we'll have real issues with that.

5885
02:49:06,410 --> 02:49:08,400
We already have advertising regulation.

5886
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,320
You can't eat,

5887
02:49:09,480 --> 02:49:12,600
you can't pop an advert saying
I've found the cure for cancer.

5888
02:49:12,650 --> 02:49:12,930
Right.

5889
02:49:12,930 --> 02:49:13,763
That's what I'm saying.

5890
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:15,230
So this is still,

5891
02:49:15,270 --> 02:49:16,470
I would argue this as a tightening.

5892
02:49:16,471 --> 02:49:16,651
So,

5893
02:49:16,651 --> 02:49:17,131
for example,

5894
02:49:17,131 --> 02:49:18,990
in London there was a big controversy,

5895
02:49:19,390 --> 02:49:19,970
um,

5896
02:49:19,970 --> 02:49:20,680
a couple of years back.

5897
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:21,513
Any billboards.

5898
02:49:21,630 --> 02:49:22,171
Exactly.

5899
02:49:22,171 --> 02:49:23,004
So it was this,

5900
02:49:23,070 --> 02:49:28,070
it was a billboard of a impossibly hot
women and impossibly hot man and the

5901
02:49:28,411 --> 02:49:29,670
billboards had something like,

5902
02:49:30,030 --> 02:49:31,380
are you beach body ready?

5903
02:49:31,710 --> 02:49:32,610
The clear implication being,

5904
02:49:32,611 --> 02:49:35,340
if you don't look like these people who
you'll never fucking look like you're

5905
02:49:35,341 --> 02:49:36,570
not ready to go to the beach.

5906
02:49:36,780 --> 02:49:38,810
And the mayor of London
City can just said this,

5907
02:49:38,930 --> 02:49:39,631
you can't do this.

5908
02:49:39,631 --> 02:49:40,350
Right.

5909
02:49:40,350 --> 02:49:42,230
You can still advertise your bodybuilding.

5910
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:43,440
That's so silly.

5911
02:49:43,441 --> 02:49:43,741
I mean,

5912
02:49:43,741 --> 02:49:44,580
this is a,

5913
02:49:44,581 --> 02:49:46,560
it's not an unobtainable ideal.

5914
02:49:46,561 --> 02:49:48,030
You're looking at two examples of it,

5915
02:49:48,330 --> 02:49:48,680
but hey,

5916
02:49:48,680 --> 02:49:49,950
they're real human beings.

5917
02:49:50,070 --> 02:49:50,251
Yeah.

5918
02:49:50,251 --> 02:49:51,084
But that's like,

5919
02:49:51,150 --> 02:49:51,361
I mean,

5920
02:49:51,361 --> 02:49:52,800
I know when I started listening,

5921
02:49:52,801 --> 02:49:55,200
I mean I'm not saying that
you have to be that way,

5922
02:49:55,350 --> 02:49:58,890
but if you do want to look like
that man and have that body,

5923
02:49:58,891 --> 02:50:00,480
it is a possible goal.

5924
02:50:01,310 --> 02:50:01,550
Yeah.

5925
02:50:01,550 --> 02:50:03,780
I mean it's not possible for
the vast majority of people,

5926
02:50:03,810 --> 02:50:04,200
right?

5927
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:06,660
Like if they don't have
the time or the effort,

5928
02:50:06,661 --> 02:50:07,494
it's not,

5929
02:50:07,550 --> 02:50:11,160
but very many people have
radically changed their body.

5930
02:50:11,161 --> 02:50:11,994
I'm not saying,

5931
02:50:12,930 --> 02:50:14,160
not saying you should do it,

5932
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:15,930
this is a possible thing to do.

5933
02:50:15,931 --> 02:50:17,760
And if you're trying to sell fitness,

5934
02:50:18,030 --> 02:50:20,730
wouldn't you sell an example of
someone who's really good at it?

5935
02:50:20,850 --> 02:50:22,560
Like if you're trying to
sell a business course,

5936
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:26,070
wouldn't you show a guy with
a giant house and a Ferrari?

5937
02:50:26,250 --> 02:50:28,320
Like this is a guy who has
done really well at business,

5938
02:50:28,440 --> 02:50:31,560
look at his penthouse apartment
overlooking Manhattan.

5939
02:50:31,890 --> 02:50:32,700
You wouldn't show,

5940
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:33,091
you wouldn't say,

5941
02:50:33,091 --> 02:50:34,740
well that's an impossible goal.

5942
02:50:34,950 --> 02:50:37,650
I'm going to show you a person in a middle
class suburb because this is as good

5943
02:50:37,651 --> 02:50:38,484
as you're ever going to get.

5944
02:50:38,850 --> 02:50:39,810
I think that's a fair point.

5945
02:50:39,870 --> 02:50:40,800
I think it's two things going on,

5946
02:50:40,801 --> 02:50:41,610
isn't there?

5947
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:42,443
There's

5948
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:45,540
the freedom of people to
market what they want to do.

5949
02:50:45,940 --> 02:50:46,270
Uh,

5950
02:50:46,270 --> 02:50:47,100
and there's,

5951
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:47,933
um,

5952
02:50:48,320 --> 02:50:51,940
it's a nanny state issue that people
have a problem with you by saying that

5953
02:50:52,140 --> 02:50:54,480
these are impossible
to achieve body goals.

5954
02:50:54,750 --> 02:50:59,400
We already have regulation at these things
and people don't call that and nanny

5955
02:50:59,401 --> 02:50:59,701
state thing.

5956
02:50:59,701 --> 02:51:02,700
I think just this idea have regulation,

5957
02:51:02,701 --> 02:51:03,061
these things,

5958
02:51:03,061 --> 02:51:03,531
but that,

5959
02:51:03,531 --> 02:51:04,410
that is not,

5960
02:51:04,430 --> 02:51:05,040
I mean this,

5961
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:06,630
I don't think this is a good example.

5962
02:51:07,210 --> 02:51:08,130
What's a better example?

5963
02:51:08,131 --> 02:51:10,680
So professor Cassa said there's two
sets of solutions to these junk valley's

5964
02:51:10,681 --> 02:51:11,514
problems.

5965
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:12,150
There's,

5966
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:12,983
um,

5967
02:51:13,350 --> 02:51:15,780
get the contaminants out of
the atmosphere sort of thing,

5968
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:19,470
which he says is actually a weaker one
than the second set of solution says.

5969
02:51:19,710 --> 02:51:22,020
So how do we stop people
being pumped full of bullshit,

5970
02:51:22,021 --> 02:51:22,741
junk values,

5971
02:51:22,741 --> 02:51:22,981
right?

5972
02:51:22,981 --> 02:51:26,160
Educate them on what is happening
to them and make it less appealing.

5973
02:51:26,190 --> 02:51:26,341
Well,

5974
02:51:26,341 --> 02:51:29,610
this is the second part and you've gotten
to what I think was the most important

5975
02:51:29,611 --> 02:51:30,241
part of the research.

5976
02:51:30,241 --> 02:51:31,700
Professor Cassa did see,

5977
02:51:31,770 --> 02:51:35,970
he was working with a guy called Nathan
Dungan and Nathan is a hearing to be,

5978
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:36,833
Nathan is a

5979
02:51:38,340 --> 02:51:40,020
financial advisor in Minneapolis.

5980
02:51:40,560 --> 02:51:42,330
And his job was to work with,

5981
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:43,110
uh,

5982
02:51:43,110 --> 02:51:46,920
adults who are having trouble budgeting
and explain budgeting to them and help

5983
02:51:46,921 --> 02:51:47,754
them do it right.

5984
02:51:48,270 --> 02:51:49,740
And it gets a cool from a school,

5985
02:51:50,420 --> 02:51:53,250
it was kind of middle class
school wasn't super rich or poor.

5986
02:51:53,280 --> 02:51:54,180
It was a middle class.

5987
02:51:54,740 --> 02:51:54,990
Uh,

5988
02:51:54,990 --> 02:51:57,240
whether they're having a problem
that the kids at this school,

5989
02:51:57,241 --> 02:52:00,480
we're becoming obsessed with getting like
the latest Nike sneakers or the latest

5990
02:52:00,510 --> 02:52:01,650
iPhone or whatever it was.

5991
02:52:01,950 --> 02:52:03,210
And if their parents couldn't afford it,

5992
02:52:03,211 --> 02:52:04,710
the kids were really freaking out.

5993
02:52:04,840 --> 02:52:05,440
Right?

5994
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:06,010
So they cite to

5995
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:06,340
Nathan,

5996
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:09,040
would you come in and just
explain budgeting to these kids?

5997
02:52:09,041 --> 02:52:09,874
Right?

5998
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:10,270
So,

5999
02:52:10,270 --> 02:52:12,940
and I think Isaiah and he tries to
explain budgeting and quickly realize is

6000
02:52:12,941 --> 02:52:14,290
these kids don't give
a shit about budgetary,

6001
02:52:14,291 --> 02:52:14,501
right?

6002
02:52:14,501 --> 02:52:15,610
There's something else going on here.

6003
02:52:15,910 --> 02:52:17,770
They are so obsessed with
getting these things.

6004
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:19,060
So with Professor Cassa,

6005
02:52:19,061 --> 02:52:23,020
he designs this program that led
to really interesting breakthrough.

6006
02:52:23,290 --> 02:52:24,460
It's saying people can try at home,

6007
02:52:24,461 --> 02:52:24,611
right?

6008
02:52:24,611 --> 02:52:25,870
You don't have to do it in this context.

6009
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:28,150
So they'd got,

6010
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:29,740
and you can do it just as adults,

6011
02:52:29,741 --> 02:52:31,060
but they did it with uh,

6012
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:32,320
parents and the teenagers,

6013
02:52:32,380 --> 02:52:33,010
right?

6014
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:33,581
They come in,

6015
02:52:33,581 --> 02:52:35,440
it was once every couple
of weeks for think,

6016
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:37,570
four months and a fast.

6017
02:52:37,571 --> 02:52:39,400
They just say the first meeting they had,

6018
02:52:39,401 --> 02:52:40,234
they just said,

6019
02:52:40,240 --> 02:52:43,360
write a list of everything
you have got to have.

6020
02:52:43,420 --> 02:52:44,253
They didn't define that.

6021
02:52:44,260 --> 02:52:44,830
Right.

6022
02:52:44,830 --> 02:52:46,780
And people of course say like a home,

6023
02:52:46,781 --> 02:52:47,201
a car,

6024
02:52:47,201 --> 02:52:47,800
whatever.

6025
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:49,930
But quite quickly people
would say Nike sneakers,

6026
02:52:49,931 --> 02:52:52,270
the parents would name
expensive things and they got,

6027
02:52:52,271 --> 02:52:52,720
okay,

6028
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:55,630
tell me how you would feel if
you got these Nike sneakers.

6029
02:52:55,631 --> 02:52:56,350
Right.

6030
02:52:56,350 --> 02:52:57,970
And very rarely I only,

6031
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:59,350
any of them were like basketball players,

6032
02:52:59,351 --> 02:52:59,651
so it was like,

6033
02:52:59,651 --> 02:53:01,600
I need the jump or whatever,

6034
02:53:01,990 --> 02:53:02,823
if that's the right phrase.

6035
02:53:03,100 --> 02:53:03,933
Um,

6036
02:53:04,090 --> 02:53:05,160
it was very low for ob.

6037
02:53:05,230 --> 02:53:05,921
Almost immediately it's,

6038
02:53:05,921 --> 02:53:07,210
I'd be accepted by the group.

6039
02:53:07,360 --> 02:53:08,290
People would envy me.

6040
02:53:08,350 --> 02:53:09,100
Right?

6041
02:53:09,100 --> 02:53:09,610
These days,

6042
02:53:09,610 --> 02:53:11,440
insights are just beneath
the surface where they go,

6043
02:53:11,740 --> 02:53:13,150
who put the idea in your head,

6044
02:53:13,180 --> 02:53:14,470
where did you get that idea?

6045
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:16,900
And of course everyone thinks
they're smarter than the ad,

6046
02:53:17,440 --> 02:53:20,890
but giving people the ability just
to see how hollow those junk values,

6047
02:53:20,891 --> 02:53:21,760
where that was the first part,

6048
02:53:22,030 --> 02:53:24,850
second part was much more interesting
and took longer than I would have in

6049
02:53:24,851 --> 02:53:25,391
future sessions.

6050
02:53:25,391 --> 02:53:26,080
They'd say,

6051
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:26,770
well,

6052
02:53:26,770 --> 02:53:27,040
okay,

6053
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:28,870
given that not actually
made you feel better,

6054
02:53:29,800 --> 02:53:32,110
what are moments in your life
when you have felt satisfied,

6055
02:53:32,140 --> 02:53:33,730
happy in a flow state?

6056
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,220
What are things that are meaningful
to you or people you know,

6057
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:37,090
a whole range of things.

6058
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:40,660
Playing sports or play music or reading,

6059
02:53:40,661 --> 02:53:41,231
whatever it was,

6060
02:53:41,231 --> 02:53:42,064
right.

6061
02:53:42,250 --> 02:53:42,521
And he said,

6062
02:53:42,521 --> 02:53:42,760
okay,

6063
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:47,560
how could we build more of that into
your life and less of these junk values?

6064
02:53:47,561 --> 02:53:50,260
How could you do more of this
every week and just meeting?

6065
02:53:50,270 --> 02:53:52,210
We don't have these conversations
in our culture very often.

6066
02:53:52,450 --> 02:53:55,640
Just meeting once every couple of
weeks and checking in with HR and go,

6067
02:53:55,641 --> 02:53:55,961
actually,

6068
02:53:55,961 --> 02:53:58,000
I managed to play guitar
for an hour every day.

6069
02:53:58,420 --> 02:54:01,090
I managed on Saturday to take my
kids to the beach and we went,

6070
02:54:01,290 --> 02:54:01,720
or whatever.

6071
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:03,280
It's going to stifle materialism.

6072
02:54:03,790 --> 02:54:04,601
What it led to,

6073
02:54:04,601 --> 02:54:06,400
sepsis is monitored by Professor Cassar.

6074
02:54:07,030 --> 02:54:09,670
It led to a significant shifts
in people's values that they,

6075
02:54:09,730 --> 02:54:09,991
they,

6076
02:54:09,991 --> 02:54:10,330
they,

6077
02:54:10,330 --> 02:54:14,350
they had a significant decrease in junk
ponies and a significant increase in,

6078
02:54:14,590 --> 02:54:17,830
in a more meaningful intrinsic values.

6079
02:54:18,130 --> 02:54:21,880
And we know that that correlates with
lower depression and anxiety over time.

6080
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:25,150
The weird thing is I sometimes
feel like with all my,

6081
02:54:25,210 --> 02:54:26,110
we both my books chasing,

6082
02:54:26,111 --> 02:54:26,381
screaming,

6083
02:54:26,381 --> 02:54:26,681
lost connection.

6084
02:54:26,681 --> 02:54:30,310
So I sometimes feel like I'm giving
people permission to know the thing they

6085
02:54:30,311 --> 02:54:31,144
already know,

6086
02:54:31,360 --> 02:54:31,930
right?

6087
02:54:31,930 --> 02:54:35,920
Like had this a completely bizarre
experience when the book first came out,

6088
02:54:35,950 --> 02:54:39,400
why was being lost connections
that depression one where
I was being interviewed

6089
02:54:39,401 --> 02:54:41,080
by some American inns of your heart.

6090
02:54:41,090 --> 02:54:41,923
My heart was,

6091
02:54:42,640 --> 02:54:43,473
and um,

6092
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:45,700
I talk about how loneliness
causes depression,

6093
02:54:45,940 --> 02:54:46,773
right?

6094
02:54:46,990 --> 02:54:48,400
And the interviewer goes saying like,

6095
02:54:49,240 --> 02:54:49,361
well,

6096
02:54:49,361 --> 02:54:51,130
this is a very controversial theory.

6097
02:54:52,190 --> 02:54:53,440
I'm kind of sitting there and I thought,

6098
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:55,990
how did we get to the point?

6099
02:54:56,020 --> 02:54:59,740
We're pointing out the most
fucking obvious thing you
can imagine that if you're

6100
02:54:59,741 --> 02:55:00,431
really lonely,

6101
02:55:00,431 --> 02:55:02,980
are much more likely to become
dollar loans as controversial at all.

6102
02:55:03,050 --> 02:55:04,400
Think that person's silly.

6103
02:55:05,190 --> 02:55:09,890
I think the reason it's controversial
is because these biological stories,

6104
02:55:10,010 --> 02:55:11,360
which have some truth in them,

6105
02:55:11,810 --> 02:55:14,030
have dominated how when I was a teenager,

6106
02:55:14,031 --> 02:55:14,680
I went to,

6107
02:55:14,680 --> 02:55:18,320
it's only thought of as being exactly
when I went to my doctor when I was a

6108
02:55:18,321 --> 02:55:22,220
teenager and I was really depressed and
I said I had this feeling like pain was

6109
02:55:22,221 --> 02:55:24,080
leaking out of me and
I couldn't control it.

6110
02:55:24,320 --> 02:55:25,220
My doctor told me,

6111
02:55:25,221 --> 02:55:26,750
and entirely biological teacher said,

6112
02:55:26,930 --> 02:55:30,220
there's just a problem with your brain
here and all you need to do is drug

6113
02:55:30,221 --> 02:55:30,741
yourself.

6114
02:55:30,741 --> 02:55:31,021
Right?

6115
02:55:31,021 --> 02:55:31,340
Right.

6116
02:55:31,340 --> 02:55:33,890
And I drug myself and I've got some
relief from the chemical antidepressants,

6117
02:55:33,891 --> 02:55:35,390
but it did not solve my depression.

6118
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:38,570
And one of the reasons I wrote lost
connections is cause after 13 years of

6119
02:55:38,571 --> 02:55:39,840
taking the maximum possible dose,

6120
02:55:39,841 --> 02:55:40,550
I was like,

6121
02:55:40,550 --> 02:55:40,731
well,

6122
02:55:40,731 --> 02:55:41,540
what's going wrong here?

6123
02:55:41,540 --> 02:55:44,540
There's something missing in this
picture cause I still feel depressed.

6124
02:55:44,750 --> 02:55:46,190
And every year that I've been alive,

6125
02:55:46,191 --> 02:55:49,760
I'm 40 depression and anxiety have
increased in the United States,

6126
02:55:49,761 --> 02:55:50,091
in Britain,

6127
02:55:50,091 --> 02:55:50,960
and across the Western world.

6128
02:55:51,170 --> 02:55:52,550
There's something missing in this picture.

6129
02:55:52,720 --> 02:55:55,010
And I think the reason
why that's controversial,

6130
02:55:55,310 --> 02:55:56,660
it seemed controversial that women,

6131
02:55:56,661 --> 02:55:57,471
even though to you and me,

6132
02:55:57,471 --> 02:55:59,960
it's crazy to think it's controversial,

6133
02:56:00,470 --> 02:56:03,890
is because these biological stories
which have some basis in reality,

6134
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:06,500
have become the whole of the
picture for a lot of people.

6135
02:56:06,501 --> 02:56:07,334
Right.

6136
02:56:07,640 --> 02:56:10,250
I had a completely
bizarre experience where,

6137
02:56:11,220 --> 02:56:12,070
you know Peter Taylor,

6138
02:56:12,071 --> 02:56:12,904
have you had him on your show?

6139
02:56:12,980 --> 02:56:13,431
No,

6140
02:56:13,431 --> 02:56:14,120
but I know him.

6141
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:14,361
Yes.

6142
02:56:14,361 --> 02:56:18,350
A pizza tell people who don't know is the
founder of paypal gazillionaire right.

6143
02:56:18,351 --> 02:56:19,370
Back to the Trump campaign.

6144
02:56:20,420 --> 02:56:24,170
I got an invitation from Peter Teal
just before it was after Trump had been

6145
02:56:24,171 --> 02:56:24,471
elected,

6146
02:56:24,471 --> 02:56:29,000
but before he'd been inaugurated
his people to go to a,

6147
02:56:29,030 --> 02:56:34,030
they were organizing a conference for
APP developers who are trying to develop

6148
02:56:36,171 --> 02:56:37,220
apps to deal with depression,

6149
02:56:37,221 --> 02:56:38,210
anxiety and addiction.

6150
02:56:38,210 --> 02:56:38,811
And I'm a bit like,

6151
02:56:38,811 --> 02:56:40,100
I don't think apps are
really the solution,

6152
02:56:40,101 --> 02:56:42,980
but I wanted an excuse to
go to San Francisco anyway,

6153
02:56:43,280 --> 02:56:44,113
so I go,

6154
02:56:44,930 --> 02:56:46,430
so day long conference,

6155
02:56:47,150 --> 02:56:48,170
I didn't hit every speech,

6156
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:50,240
but some really great scientists,

6157
02:56:50,241 --> 02:56:52,790
people like Thomas and saw who was the
former head of the National Institute of

6158
02:56:52,790 --> 02:56:53,420
Health,

6159
02:56:53,420 --> 02:56:54,940
who's hugely armor man.

6160
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:57,860
And I'm sitting there and I'm like,

6161
02:56:59,420 --> 02:57:01,970
all they're doing is looking
at pictures of brain scans.

6162
02:57:02,150 --> 02:57:02,983
Right.

6163
02:57:03,140 --> 02:57:08,030
If all you knew about depression and
anxiety was this conference and addiction,

6164
02:57:08,450 --> 02:57:11,000
you would literally think they were just
things that happen inside the brain.

6165
02:57:11,020 --> 02:57:11,660
Yes.

6166
02:57:11,660 --> 02:57:12,950
And I'm like the last person up,

6167
02:57:12,951 --> 02:57:14,030
I don't think this was designed this way.

6168
02:57:14,031 --> 02:57:14,864
Maybe they did.

6169
02:57:15,290 --> 02:57:16,250
I'm saying that I'm thinking,

6170
02:57:16,460 --> 02:57:17,660
what do I say to these people?

6171
02:57:17,661 --> 02:57:18,494
And I thought,

6172
02:57:18,830 --> 02:57:19,663
you know,

6173
02:57:20,900 --> 02:57:22,640
it's like I was trying to get metaphors.

6174
02:57:22,880 --> 02:57:26,300
You could have a conference about obesity
that just looked at scans of people's

6175
02:57:26,301 --> 02:57:26,841
stomachs,

6176
02:57:26,841 --> 02:57:27,674
right?

6177
02:57:27,770 --> 02:57:28,670
It wouldn't be untrue.

6178
02:57:28,671 --> 02:57:29,990
It wouldn't be bad science,

6179
02:57:30,170 --> 02:57:31,970
but had missed the whole
fucking reason why they're fat.

6180
02:57:32,030 --> 02:57:32,301
Right,

6181
02:57:32,301 --> 02:57:32,660
right.

6182
02:57:32,660 --> 02:57:33,230
But you could,

6183
02:57:33,230 --> 02:57:37,640
you could tell the plot of Romeo and
Juliet using like Newtonian physics.

6184
02:57:37,641 --> 02:57:38,510
You could draw a diagram.

6185
02:57:38,511 --> 02:57:39,620
Romeo moves this way,

6186
02:57:39,800 --> 02:57:40,633
Juliet,

6187
02:57:40,910 --> 02:57:43,790
you won't understand a re a damn
thing about why anyone does anything.

6188
02:57:43,791 --> 02:57:44,624
Right?

6189
02:57:45,110 --> 02:57:49,910
It was such a deep misunderstanding
or not misunderstanding such a partial

6190
02:57:49,911 --> 02:57:50,331
truth.

6191
02:57:50,331 --> 02:57:50,750
Right?

6192
02:57:50,750 --> 02:57:51,530
And I said to them,

6193
02:57:51,530 --> 02:57:53,660
so we were in San Francisco where
we're really near the tenderloin,

6194
02:57:53,661 --> 02:57:55,220
which helps the people knows a place,

6195
02:57:55,221 --> 02:57:56,630
a lot of chaotic straight addiction.

6196
02:57:56,810 --> 02:57:57,643
It's like,

6197
02:57:58,220 --> 02:57:59,060
let's not discuss this.

6198
02:57:59,061 --> 02:58:00,830
Let's all just walk
over to the tenderloin,

6199
02:58:01,350 --> 02:58:03,330
sit with the first person
with an addiction problem.

6200
02:58:03,331 --> 02:58:04,164
We meet,

6201
02:58:04,240 --> 02:58:08,070
listened to their life story for half an
hour and come back and tell me the main

6202
02:58:08,071 --> 02:58:08,990
problem here is,

6203
02:58:09,070 --> 02:58:10,710
is a malfunction of the Amygdala.

6204
02:58:11,010 --> 02:58:13,240
It's a bizarre misunderstand that.

6205
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:15,020
Is there something going
on with making lists?

6206
02:58:15,060 --> 02:58:15,810
Yes.

6207
02:58:15,810 --> 02:58:17,400
Is it important to
understand that science,

6208
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:18,391
of course,

6209
02:58:18,391 --> 02:58:18,631
right?

6210
02:58:18,631 --> 02:58:20,070
I'm strongly in favor of brain science.

6211
02:58:20,310 --> 02:58:22,290
I'm in favor of the science
of understanding the stomach.

6212
02:58:23,190 --> 02:58:28,190
It's a bizarre reduction of what human
beings are to think that these are the

6213
02:58:28,381 --> 02:58:30,540
main drivers of these crises.

6214
02:58:30,541 --> 02:58:31,374
Right.

6215
02:58:31,440 --> 02:58:32,850
It's ridiculous.

6216
02:58:34,170 --> 02:58:35,003
Yeah.

6217
02:58:35,130 --> 02:58:35,411
Sorry,

6218
02:58:35,411 --> 02:58:36,030
I agree.

6219
02:58:36,030 --> 02:58:37,050
And we have to wrap this up.

6220
02:58:37,051 --> 02:58:38,820
Were were already after
I really drove the truck.

6221
02:58:38,821 --> 02:58:42,150
Can I just say very quickly that anyone
who wants any more in from a publishers

6222
02:58:42,300 --> 02:58:43,650
fucking whip me if I don't say this,

6223
02:58:43,830 --> 02:58:44,080
uh,

6224
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:48,000
anybody wants any more information about
either of my books chasing the scream

6225
02:58:48,001 --> 02:58:51,780
is WWB dot chasing the scream.com you can
listen to audio of loads of the people

6226
02:58:51,781 --> 02:58:54,330
we've talked about and take a quiz to
see how much you know about addiction and

6227
02:58:54,331 --> 02:58:58,620
loss connections is
www.thelosconnections.com and
there are audiobooks are both

6228
02:58:58,621 --> 02:59:00,150
those books as well that
you can get on those sites.

6229
02:59:00,180 --> 02:59:00,720
Beautiful.

6230
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:01,553
Thank you very much.

6231
02:59:01,740 --> 02:59:02,550
Cheers.

6232
02:59:02,550 --> 02:59:03,090
Thank you very much.

6233
02:59:03,090 --> 02:59:03,923
Thanks.

6234
02:59:04,380 --> 02:59:07,270
Hurray.
