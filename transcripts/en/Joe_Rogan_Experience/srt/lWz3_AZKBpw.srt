1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,393
Yeah.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,663
Rolling.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,040
[inaudible]

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,090
that's what they decided to do to them
to make it look like they found his body.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,360
He was 22 and I'm sure he was probably
involved with a bunch of waves as the

6
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:30,564
evening.

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,340
Some of the unscrupulous intentions,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:33,950
you know,

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,800
just David Carradine,

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,121
he was in conflict with,

11
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:36,954
he likes to party,

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,190
notorious accidental mechanical at
68 was found hogtied wearing too wet

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,730
dialing gloves and slippers,

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,650
rubberized underwear and a
headmaster pork right here.

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,843
Investigations.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,350
Gary all just his death was not caused.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,450
Yeah,

18
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,283
that looks fine.

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,420
What's your definition of the 51 year
old pastor wasn't voted as home at the

20
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:10,350
time.

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,290
We'd gone apparently in the mess.

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,503
Yeah.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,840
Wow Man.

24
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:17,270
Yeah,

25
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,690
that's fine.

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,523
All right,

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:18,970
we ready?

28
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,420
Oh,

29
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,253
what police?

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,070
That's it.

31
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,400
They chose not to mention what police
discovered inside the ministers rubber

32
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:25,234
briefs.

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,430
And if you click on that link
they found a giant black.

34
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:31,264
So

35
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:31,960
Ah,

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,793
ah,

37
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,860
corked and Jamie here
recording audio of all of this.

38
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,783
Yes.

39
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,683
We're uh,

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,240
we're in the kitchen with Tonka trucks.

41
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,730
Haul got allergies or something.

42
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:48,500
Does the podcast studio has
been transformed because a
big part of the new Scifi

43
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,810
show deals with the podcasts are,

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,320
he's in it.

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,920
And so it's young Duncan Trussell and uh,

46
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,290
we're filming a lot of the guests
and some of the discussions here,

47
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,720
uh,

48
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,431
at the studio.

49
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:03,431
So if you could see this is usually
not cluttered and crazy and uh,

50
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:04,790
they,

51
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,290
they changed the decorations a little.

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,153
They gave us this,

53
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,440
this fucking stupid thing.

54
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,281
I don't know what that is,

55
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:13,290
but it makes it more saifai whatever.

56
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,360
Um,

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,650
so today was a doctor Jeffrey Meldrum.

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,240
He's a lead shit scientists who
heavily believes in bigfoot,

59
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,163
I don't know,

60
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,710
but fun stuff.

61
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,480
And we'd been going nonstop.

62
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,000
The show starts airing July 16th,

63
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,990
and where,

64
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,740
uh,

65
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,300
the schedule's just been ridiculous,

66
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,860
but we're meeting a lot of really
cool people and so far as Lana,

67
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,003
pretty cool shit.

68
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,620
And that's all the crew back there.

69
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,980
Think of times that a lot of
shit to show you fuckers for.

70
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,903
Shit,

71
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,943
I'm so tired.

72
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,060
I haven't slept right in days.

73
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,171
I've been fine.

74
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,040
All of the fucking world.

75
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,260
I flew from Canada to New York,

76
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:54,561
New York,

77
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:55,200
North Carolina,

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,150
North Carolina here,

79
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,950
and from here we got to go to Texas.

80
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,220
Dunkin's going to go to or no.

81
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:00,431
Dot.

82
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,610
He's going to go to Colorado and I got
to go to Texas and then I got to go to

83
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:04,444
Alaska.

84
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,970
But it's gonna be bad ass.

85
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,310
Hopefully it'll suck either way.

86
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll tell you,

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,970
I'll create a pseudonym.

88
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,080
I'll go online.

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,050
I'll tell you my show stock.

90
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,010
That'd be really obvious though.

91
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,841
They'll be like,

92
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:17,050
whoa,

93
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,460
job until where are you said telepathy
already exist in the form of language,

94
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,180
right?

95
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,170
With language.

96
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,970
Your mouth is making certain sounds
and then you run those downs through a

97
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:29,260
cultural context.

98
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,820
A dictionary of sure.

99
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,850
What we've accepted that
those sounds represent.

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,860
And through that I can read your mind.

101
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,220
Yeah.

102
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,210
And that's what you're doing.

103
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:39,130
When you were describing
to me your encounter,

104
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,921
meeting your friend,

105
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:43,480
and while you're jogging and various
coincidences that have happened through

106
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:43,920
your life,

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,160
I'm essentially reading a
version of your thoughts on the,

108
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,500
on these subjects and dad is telepathy.

109
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,530
And that is what separates
human beings from other animals.

110
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,780
That what we're dealing with as far as
like what we call psychic energy might

111
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,310
just be a,

112
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,211
we are,

113
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:06,211
we are slowly emerging and we
were slowly developing these,

114
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,110
these potential abilities and a guy like
band a check may be able to come along

115
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:15,610
and dismiss all of these because they're
not as tangible as a noise that comes

116
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,420
from your mouth.

117
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,410
Maybe it takes a million years to develop
these abilities and maybe right now we

118
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:21,244
just,

119
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,600
the whispers of these abilities are
possible maybe where it's like a radio

120
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:28,330
station that you can only
tune in during a thunderstorm,

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,530
but it's just like it was tiny weird
phenomenon that only happens like upon

122
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,250
occasion.

123
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,150
That is possible.

124
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,250
It is certainly possible.

125
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,420
And another thing about psychic energy
that makes it fantastic and very

126
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:44,710
interesting to discuss is the fact
that so many people have claimed to

127
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:49,711
experience it and so many people I think
almost recognized at a genetic level

128
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,250
that that's coming and that is an emerging
aspect of human consciousness and the

129
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,900
ability to do it nonverbally

130
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,070
yeah,

131
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,270
I mean yeah,

132
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,860
it's one I can say one thing
is indisputable right now.

133
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,190
There is no accepted
proof that this exists.

134
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,850
There's no accepted proof.

135
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,953
We don't know.

136
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,960
We don't know that it exists right now
that is indisputable and that does not

137
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,770
mean that it doesn't exist.

138
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:21,280
And that's what's really cool about the
scientific method and this approach to

139
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,380
truth is it,

140
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:24,820
it isn't committed one way or the other.

141
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,640
It's not.

142
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,960
And I don't even think vantage check was
completely closed off to the idea that

143
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,800
it wasn't real.

144
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:29,980
Yeah,

145
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,813
it was.

146
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,930
I thought for a moment he said,

147
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,441
I don't know,

148
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:32,681
may,

149
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:33,970
I thought there was like something in,

150
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:34,804
they're always like,

151
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,890
it hasn't been proven,

152
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,760
but maybe I don't remember.

153
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:37,380
Maybe I just,

154
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,310
well thanks for checking.

155
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,420
You might've put that in asleep.

156
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,353
So yeah,

157
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,243
you said me

158
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,810
said maybe it's weird.

159
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,190
I want,

160
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,490
one thing that I love about this show,

161
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,020
what it's done to me is if you think I'm
a hippie now before the show I was much

162
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:53,970
more of a heavy,

163
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:58,971
and then you come into contact with
people who are really in believing this

164
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,760
thing or that thing and
won't listen to logic.

165
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,630
And then that becomes really appalling
when you realize that from an

166
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:10,610
individual's POV it's kind
of sad or cute or whatever.

167
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:14,570
But from a group of people believing
in things that aren't provable,

168
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,550
that shit gets really bad.

169
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,320
And also I,

170
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:19,820
one thing that vantage has pointed out,

171
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:22,310
which I really liked
just how dangerous it is,

172
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,970
a,

173
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,970
when people decide to use methods that
are easily recreated to actually get

174
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:33,020
money from people and pray
on the their vulnerabilities,

175
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,280
like they miss a loved one,

176
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,260
they show them a few parlor tricks,

177
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,470
makes maybe think that they have these
abilities and then suddenly they're

178
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:44,471
taking money from them to let them talk
to their grandparents who've done or

179
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,190
their parents have died that's evil.

180
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,290
And then you take that one step further
and you get the priest class who

181
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,660
convinces groups of people
that they can talk to God.

182
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,210
And then they start
churches and religions.

183
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,980
And then the next thing you know
you've got an even deeper problems.

184
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:04,310
So I think that stuff that vantage
check does and that skeptics do,

185
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:06,170
it's really important and good.

186
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:07,850
And it's important to be skeptical,

187
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,980
but you can't be skeptical to the point
where you step on your own experience,

188
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,930
where your skepticism override something
that you've actually experienced.

189
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,201
Yeah.

190
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:21,860
But isn't it possible that skepticism
not overrides what you've actually

191
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:24,620
experienced but defines it explains it?

192
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,140
Well,

193
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,490
if,

194
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:25,960
if it,

195
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,190
if it can be explained,

196
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,180
if it can be explained.

197
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,870
Yeah.

198
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,950
So far everything you've said,

199
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:30,910
I believe can be explained.

200
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:31,841
Yeah.

201
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:32,260
I,

202
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,300
and also just because
something can be explained,

203
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,030
it doesn't mean that
it's no longer special,

204
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:37,781
are wonderful.

205
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,400
It just means that now
you know what it is.

206
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,940
Yes.

207
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,750
I agree with that.

208
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,140
I think that's really important and I
become much more of a skeptic because of

209
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:44,974
the show as well.

210
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,670
Um,

211
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,100
and talking to people
that believe in things.

212
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:52,450
You also recognize these patterns that
exist over and over again and people that

213
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:57,451
believe in things and it's that they
don't ever contemplate the contrary.

214
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,620
They don't,

215
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,640
they don't ever consider whether or
not what they believe in is nonsense.

216
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,880
They just go forward with sort of this,

217
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:09,160
this blind conviction that what they're,

218
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,870
whether it's about aliens or psychics
or big foot or whatever it's about,

219
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,180
they go forth with this conviction that
they have the truth and they want to

220
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:20,080
expose the truth.

221
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,730
I think that can function

222
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,210
because of his head sled
over until I can come.

223
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,170
Cause when you touch my butt,

224
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,460
who wants to live forever?

225
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:51,750
Yeah,

226
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,420
let's kill life after life still running.

227
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,333
We're rolling

228
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,910
white terror,

229
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,861
silver.

230
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:10,260
Come by.

231
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,750
Fear.
