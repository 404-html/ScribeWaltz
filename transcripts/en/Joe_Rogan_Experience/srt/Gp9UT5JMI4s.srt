1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,790
Her low freak bitches.
Just a few people at heard UFC from the

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,990
old days and the hoist gracie days and
the um,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,360
the vast majority of the public was kind
of out of the loop and then they put it

4
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:16,350
on the ultimate fighter and you know,
it was sort of the prime of reality tv

5
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:20,400
back then.
And that fight between forrest griffin

6
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,370
and Stephan Bonner,
which was such a wild ass fight that

7
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:28,371
sort of made mma and we really did it
made the UFC and [inaudible] needs

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,010
something like that.
They need would if those two played it

9
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,080
safe that night.
It's a good point.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,033
What would we be here,
Joe?

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,450
It's a good point.
Where do we beat y'all?

12
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:39,000
It's a good point.
I'd probably be a in Texas right now

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:39,843
doing stand up.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,530
I probably would have never worked for
the,

15
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,780
you probably would have went under.
Yeah man.

16
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,900
I mean keyboard warriors were telling
forrest griffin how sloppy he looked at

17
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:52,290
night and Stephan Bonner was,
it showed or whatever the fuck they

18
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,170
would say.
You know,

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,600
who does a chode does anybody know?
Is that a real thing?

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,640
You know what they like to call people
today?

21
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:02,220
I've known as a cook.
I cook a cock.

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,970
That's a big thing.
I said,

23
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,213
well,
you know what it is.

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,300
It's like the kids on the Internet have
found a new insult.

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,690
Like cock has only been around for like,
yeah,

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,860
okay.
See You k w well it comes from a

27
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,920
cuckold,
which is like a guy who likes watching

28
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:24,690
his wife get fucked by other men,
usually manlier men.

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,080
And uh,
how the term Jolie,

30
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,510
I'm online.
I frequented the Internet,

31
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,390
sir to cut,
cut,

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,350
cut,
cold.

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,160
Right.
Might say,

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,520
correct me if I'm wrong Jamie,
but I believe that's what it's about.

35
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,990
You know,
who would know,

36
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:42,990
I wish Jim Norton was here.
He could explain this to us in its

37
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:47,190
entirety,
but there is a whole genre of porn based

38
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,430
or ah,
around like really nerdy white guys who

39
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:53,340
have like this smoking hot wife that's
not satisfied.

40
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:55,710
And some guys like,
shut the fuck up and sit down.

41
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,030
I'm going to fuck your wife in front of
you.

42
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,010
Oh No.
And they cry.

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,970
And some of them,
they make the,

44
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,020
they make the husband's suck their Dick.
That happens too.

45
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,863
Well,
yeah,

46
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,800
that's a cook.
That's how,

47
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,800
you know the husband is suck.
His Dick is the cook.

48
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,140
They guy that comes in as much of,
that guy's a stud guy who comes in and

49
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:14,890
smashes it.
But I dunno if she's a stud,

50
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,110
if he lets the guy stuck his deck.

51
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,250
That's just weird.
Yeah.

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,710
That's where it goes deep.
You know,

53
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,060
there's like a spectrum.
Even cock porn,

54
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,240
keeping cocked,
porn has a,

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,150
there's a lot of variables they have to
take into consideration.

56
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,970
But I see people calling people cox all
the time.

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,320
Like when you're calling another man to
cook as an insult,

58
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,510
what does that say about you and the
porn that you watched it,

59
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:37,590
you know,
that is,

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,000
that just says you frequent like reddit
or something or you're on twitter all

61
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:43,260
the time.
I mean,

62
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,640
I don't think it says anything about it.
I just think it's,

63
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,480
it's a new thing to call someone to hurt
their feelings.

64
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,430
You know,
like there's no other,

65
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,950
there's no equivalent word.
Like,

66
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:55,830
it's a new,
it's a new sort of like a classification

67
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:58,410
of someone to call someone a cook and
you fucking cook.

68
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,303
Yeah.
You,

69
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,350
well now I'm sorry I have to start
calling people that.

70
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,740
No,
don't do it.

71
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,180
Can we just promoted it to the world?
Isn't that kind of thing before and how

72
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:10,640
it's going to be fucking Holy Shit.
No,

73
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:12,840
they've been doing it forever.
They're going to call people like

74
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,630
Hashtag powerful cook.

75
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,240
Oh,
you just started something now,

76
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:18,770
man.
Just made a big mistake.

77
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,540
You know what?
I noticed it a lot when a Kurt Kurt

78
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,373
Metzger,
Ooh,

79
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,740
he's a writer for Amy Schumer show.
He's funny.

80
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:29,970
Standup comedian.
Very funny guy.

81
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,820
And uh,
he was one of the writers for Amy

82
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,100
Schumer's show when she was getting
accused of plagiarism and all this stuff

83
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:38,610
was going on and I was seeing all these
people calling them a cock and I was

84
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:39,444
like,
what is this?

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,830
And then I noticed it was like
everywhere.

86
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:43,470
People call people cooks.
Like everyone's a cook,

87
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,540
Cook.
It's just a phase.

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,310
I hope so.
There you go.

89
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,890
So if someone calls you a cook now,
you know,

90
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,030
I was like,
what am I a chicken?

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,953
Fuck is that

92
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,850
I don't get it.
Cluck.

93
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,690
Now I will get it.
Oh yeah,

94
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,070
the Internet's,
I don't know all of my,

95
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,630
all the haters.
Now we're going to,

96
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:01,464
can we call me a cook?

97
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,440
You think?
I don't think it'll work.

98
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,520
It doesn't work.
If you don't like actually watching your

99
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:10,190
wife get gorilla fuck by some greater,
first of all,

100
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,530
you got to find a dude.
Fuck your wife day.

101
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:14,840
You can't kick his ass.
That's not,

102
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,700
it's not like a regular Guy Joe
Schilling.

103
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,030
So this is a different sort of scenario.
A real caucus supposed to be like a

104
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:24,020
feeble person who lets,
I'm a fucking Lawrence Taylor type dude

105
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:27,320
come into his bedroom and fuck the shit
out of his little white wife.

106
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,060
Uh,
there's a visual for it.

107
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:29,894
Yeah,
there you go.

108
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,460
That kind of a thing.
You know,

109
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,710
let's Tuck won't work.
I mean then,

110
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,350
but they'll try it on you anyway.
It's,

111
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,120
I mean,
I wonder if we've run out of insults.

112
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,870
I mean it's just cause it's coq one day
using it so often.

113
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,820
Even when it's not,
it's not really applicable.

114
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,110
And they're doing it because it's a new
one.

115
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:54,430
Like we got a new one just like,
it's not like this makes sense.

116
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,260
Let me call him a faggot.
This makes sense.

117
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,640
Let me call him a pussy.
No,

118
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,410
it's like we've got this world,
it's just throwing around until,

119
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,970
it's almost like they found a new word
and they just throw it and around until

120
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,971
it's useless and we're promoting it
quicker now.

121
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,780
What,
just reporters here,

122
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:12,830
Joe Schilling was just talking about the
world.

123
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,340
You and I are,
we're essentially journalists.

124
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,750
Yeah.
We're current events journalists.

125
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,010
We're trying and might,
there might be some old folks right now

126
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,020
that it may be,
uh,

127
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,010
you know,
not in the same social groups is us.

128
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,570
Maybe they live in Iowa or something
like that.

129
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,850
And uh,
they just trying to dip their toe into

130
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:28,750
the rest of the world.
Like what,

131
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:30,250
what are these kids talking about these
days?

132
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,580
Let me see what a comedian and a
kickboxer have to say about the world.

133
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,950
And then they find out about Cox and
then,

134
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:36,371
uh,
you know,

135
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:40,120
their wife later is going through their
google search and she finds cock,

136
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,600
what the hell is it called?
Fuck is a cook.

137
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,430
And then she starts looking up cook and
she finds Kuk Porn.

138
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,950
And then she gets excited and she thinks
my house,

139
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,300
but I don't want,
Oh God,

140
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,610
Oh fuck me in front of him.
I know when I'm gonna do,

141
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:53,770
I'm gonna set some shit up.
And then she,

142
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,300
uh,
goes on craigslist,

143
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
find some dude and she thanks.
You know,

144
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:00,680
she's fulfilling a fantasy.
Try Spice up the relationship and

145
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,670
suicide,
murder,

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,491
suicide,
murder,

147
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,020
suicide probably,
right.

148
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,030
Yeah.
That's,

149
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,590
it's hard to come back from that one.
Kenza how far in that far out in the

150
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:13,930
sticks we're talking about what does a
deal with Ahmad Ahmad,

151
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,950
it's called a model.
Got just the kitty thing.

152
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,930
Cox and mods cucs a months.
Furries I'm starting to cook is not

153
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,390
going to catch on.
I still don't get it.

154
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,010
Still like still good cook,
but she just call the Guy Cock your cock

155
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,630
sucker fucking nope,
nope,

156
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,513
nope,
nope,

157
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,730
nope.
You fucking cook.

158
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,590
Yeah,
they like it.

159
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,010
It's a new word.
It's exciting news.

160
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,540
Let him use it.
The people haven't had a new word to

161
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:42,530
call people and so long and they're
trying to take away so many of them.

162
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,140
It used to be when I was a kid,
you can call a kid a Faggot,

163
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,120
you know,
and now you gay bashing.

164
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,460
Yeah.
Back then it had nothing to do with

165
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,960
being gay,
but it's too late.

166
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,230
That's connected to that.
It's really hard to use.

167
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,120
Retard.
It's hard to use.

168
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,320
Retard.
No today.

169
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,090
You know,
even though it's not even a

170
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:02,780
classification for mental illness has
nothing to do with down syndrome.

171
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,370
Like retarded means slow growth,
like slow to catch on.

172
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,400
It is literally the perfect word to use
for retards when someone's a retard,

173
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,780
like calling them a retard is a perfect
word.

174
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,750
Like you would never say that about
someone who has a disease or someone who

175
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:22,190
has down syndrome,
but if someone's like it wants trump

176
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,910
wins,
ward people talking over,

177
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,880
that's where retired.
That's a retard,

178
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,500
right?
Fucking radar.

179
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,170
It's the right word.
It's the word.

180
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,750
These goddamn language police
motherfuckers,

181
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,520
they've,
they've typed sensitive to sensitive

182
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,940
punch of Cox fucking sensitive cucs
they've traded debt catch up.

183
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:44,560
Maybe I do like it.
It's fucking,

184
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,040
we need a new card.
I'm happy.

185
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,200
It's horrendous.
That actually works in the description.

186
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,150
Right.
It's weak little bitch that would let

187
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,100
some other man fuck his wife.
Yes.

188
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,600
Same Person.
It would be like,

189
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,730
oh,
don't call him a retard.

190
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,350
Exactly.
We need to be more sensitive about the

191
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,490
way we communicate both they're really
trying to do is just control people.

192
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,380
It's a trend.
It's the pussification.

193
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,070
Yes.
The goddamn pussification of America.

194
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,630
I see something in America that's like
the whole world,

195
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:10,820
the whole world fucking pussification of
everybody.

196
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,990
Oh yeah.
Well,

197
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,280
and it's also not not being honest about
what the fuck's going on.

198
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,250
You know,
like when something happens,

199
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,630
we have to be real sensitive to who we
insult post post,

200
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,210
like attacks.
Like with shit that was going on in

201
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:28,770
Germany where all these women were
getting raped during New Year's eve cut

202
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,930
because of all these Islamic refugees
that they had come in from Syria.

203
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,740
I mean,
it's just,

204
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,230
that's just the way it is.
[inaudible] people are coming from a

205
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:38,690
completely different culture in their
culture.

206
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,100
Women are much more suppressed.
They come over to this country,

207
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,000
Germany,
where women are Western eyes,

208
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,780
they're free and they're wearing skirts
and their tits or hanging out and way

209
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,970
they're dressed normal and getting
attacked,

210
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,670
and so what is the fucking mayor of?
Was it Berlin?

211
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,920
Tell them,
stay away from men and dress different,

212
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,700
stay an arm's length away from men and
dress more conservatively.

213
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:04,680
Like literally this fucking,
these people are so sensitive and

214
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,170
worried that they're going to hurt
someone's feelings or they're going to

215
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,830
be called Islamophobic or racist in some
way,

216
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,830
that they're,
they're telling women who've done

217
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,530
nothing wrong,
that they should dress differently

218
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,420
because they've unfortunately let these
people in from another culture that

219
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,230
think about things differently.
Yeah,

220
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,690
a bunch of Cox fucking Cox sensitive
dazzle,

221
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,070
the mayor of Berlin or wherever it was,
it was a woman.

222
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,930
Was it Berlin?
I remember when the city was,

223
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,960
but that's a woman,
so it's even more confusing.

224
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,930
But boy did she get fucking raked over
the coals online.

225
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,990
People are getting tired of it.
The pendulum swings both ways.

226
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,050
You know,
it swings towards ultra sensitivity and

227
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,310
then people get sick of that and they
go,

228
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:49,920
what the fuck?
And then they go hard the other way.

229
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,550
I think that's one the reasons why trump
is the republican nominee.

230
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,760
I think Caitlyn Jenner is responsible
for a lot of it.

231
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,770
I think people saw that and they're
like,

232
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,490
what the fuck?
They just like,

233
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,880
what?
What are you doing?

234
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,030
What do you,
what does this 62 year old man now he's

235
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,700
a woman,
call me kate on the cover of Vanity

236
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,170
Fair,
going to be naked on the cover of sports

237
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,230
illustrated.
And then she went like athlete of the

238
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,710
year,
fuck,

239
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,400
get the fuck out of it.

240
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,570
She was a woman of the year.
Yeah,

241
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,700
woman of the year should a woman for a
week.

242
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,520
She winds women of the year just shows
you men can do everything,

243
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,000
including could.
When women in the year be this cock.

244
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,750
Jamie pulled up the fucking definition.
Is this an urban dictionary?

245
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,910
What's a better definition?
I think that the one you gave,

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,833
oh,
how dare you?

247
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,670
A demasculated millennial liberal male
who often speaks of white privilege and

248
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:42,480
modern feminism blames white men for all
of the world's problems.

249
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,460
Hmm.
It's the new definition there,

250
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,780
but now
I like,

251
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,830
I like this though.
There it goes chat again with the

252
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,350
megaphone telling everyone that he's a
Vegan.

253
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,790
What a cook.
Okay.

254
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,460
I like that.
I liked that a lot.

255
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,430
But um,
look up cock hold,

256
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,170
but cock hold is different.
It's a different,

257
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,690
uh,
short for conservative.

258
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,900
What fucking the word cock is most
commonly used on twitter to describe

259
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,690
anti white males while it was originally
formed with the original meaning of Kack

260
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,620
Kack hold the use of the word cock does
not necessarily denote a sexual

261
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:23,190
connotation.

262
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,150
Wow.
It's morphing.

263
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,580
The language is evolving before our
eyes.

264
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,890
Cox do not care about Islamic countries
throwing gays off buildings or hanging

265
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:36,690
them as much as the cake Baker who is
Christian and weren't served gay wedding

266
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:37,590
customers.
Oh,

267
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:38,910
that's interesting.
Coxe.

268
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,210
Give a free pass to anyone who
criticized them for fear of looking

269
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:44,610
racist or homophobic.
We'll still have that lady in Germany is

270
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:47,400
a cook.
The word originated from white

271
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,670
nationalists vocabulary.
But he's still widely used by all.

272
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,713
Okay.
But that,

273
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,720
so,
but they took cock hold and turned it

274
00:11:55,721 --> 00:12:00,360
into this new thing go to.
But what does cut the definition for KOC

275
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,530
hold?
So this has nothing to do with guys'

276
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:06,250
wives getting bang by just to me,
it's still real to me.

277
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:08,650
Damn it.
I was also like an official definition

278
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,530
that I'm like a little dictionary from
old English.

279
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,030
Oh,
it means a man whose wife was

280
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:13,570
unfaithful.

281
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,220
Yeah.
Cuckold which is,

282
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:15,970
yeah,
yeah.

283
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,910
To make a cuckold of,
so if you,

284
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:19,744
okay,
that's uh,

285
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,620
that's how Norton I think described it
to me like a man,

286
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,500
if you,
if your wife is out banging other dudes

287
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,140
and you know about it,
but you don't say anything,

288
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,560
you become a cock hold.
But there's also like cock hold porn

289
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,510
where it's like I said,
the guys there while like sobbing in the

290
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,000
corner while his wife gets grilled,
fucked.

291
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,300
Interesting.
The world is evolving.

292
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,760
It's beautiful.
So it's still open,

293
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,700
open season then for use cook anyway you
want,

294
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,400
because we were really just hit like
five definitions.

295
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,470
I still have a fucking clue.
I mean,

296
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,610
yeah.
I mean,

297
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:59,440
a bunch of cooks it of cooks.
I liked that one definition though.

298
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,820
The the,
the Vegan,

299
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,790
it's gets on the megaphone.
It's usually a Vegan who's been a Vegan

300
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,200
for like a month to,
all right.

301
