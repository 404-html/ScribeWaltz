1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,050
Yes.
All right.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,180
We're live.
Hey,

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,110
what's up man?
How are you?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,380
I'm well,
I'm here with Tovar surreally.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,810
He's got his pen and his notebook out
like he's about to take notes.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,960
Uh,
author of the mindful carnivore boy,

7
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:18,910
you went to an unusual path,
man.

8
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:21,010
And this is one of the reasons why I
really wanted to talk to you.

9
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,330
A,
I've read some of your stuff and I've

10
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:26,080
seen some interviews with you online.
Obviously a very intelligent,

11
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:30,310
very thoughtful guy.
He started out a Vegan and became a

12
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:31,660
hunter.
Boy,

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,210
that's,
that's a tricky path and it had to be a

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,240
fraught with peril,
right?

15
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,920
I mean,
how much grief did you take for that?

16
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,120
First of all?
You know,

17
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,840
not as much as I kind of anticipate
really.

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,250
I mean,
that gives you live in Vermont,

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,570
but you know,
they could be part of it,

20
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:52,370
you know,
they can't get to you up there and it's,

21
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,260
and it's a funny blend.

22
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,720
The cultures there.
Uh,

23
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,620
I mean,
I didn't become vegetarian until I was

24
00:00:56,621 --> 00:01:00,340
like 20,
so I spent basically 20 to 30 as

25
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,770
vegetarian,
mostly Vegan that whole time.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,750
And so then in my early thirties,
I made this kind of bizarre transitioned

27
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,400
into,
into being a hunter.

28
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,170
Uh,
and I wondered how friends,

29
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:16,480
not so much family,
cause I had one uncle who,

30
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,570
who was a hunter and was well respected
but you know,

31
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,780
but friends,
you know,

32
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:23,740
I wondered,
you know,

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,330
what,
what was that going to be like?

34
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,770
And uh,
uh,

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,160
there were some,
you know,

36
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:31,780
some occasionally odd moments with,
with friends or neighbors,

37
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,020
but not as much as you might expect.
What was it that made you switch over?

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,190
Like what was there a moment?
Was it a realization?

39
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,310
Was it an accumulation of information?
Like what was it?

40
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,730
I mean,
the switch to being vegetarian had a lot

41
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:53,731
to do with ethics and animal welfare and
compassion and then it became other

42
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:54,910
issues,
environmental,

43
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:55,744
you know,
kinds of things.

44
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,470
The switchback,
um,

45
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,260
the first step really was starting to
realize that my diet,

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,660
whatever I was eating was connected to
all kinds of things that I didn't

47
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,560
realize,
you know,

48
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,040
control of deer in soybean fields to
make tofu.

49
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,060
I mean,
yeah,

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,000
you know,
the control is a nice way.

51
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,230
It is.
It's a gentle,

52
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:18,160
it's a gentle word,
right?

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,870
Um,
and just the impact of agriculture on

54
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:25,540
the landscape as a whole.
Talk About Wildlife Habitat disappearing

55
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,890
in a hurry,
you know,

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,490
um,
and even the local organic farmer down

57
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:31,570
the road where we,
you know,

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,700
go get organic strawberries,
you know,

59
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:38,320
when there's enough crop damage,
he calls a friend and they shoot a deer

60
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,610
or their smoke bomb in the woodchucks
all the time.

61
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:45,611
And so there are all kinds of impacts
that I realized my diet was having,

62
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,730
even though I wasn't eating animals,
you know,

63
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,300
indirectly that didn't change my diet,
that just sort of soften these very

64
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,020
black and white hard edges that I had
drawn in my,

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,250
these ethical

66
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,810
lines.
Right.

67
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,430
The shift to actually eating something
different had more to do with

68
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,460
nutritional needs in the longterm.
And once I started eating some yogurt,

69
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,130
which is a big radical step,
if you've been Vegan for 10 years,

70
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:16,690
you know,
eating a bowl of yogurt is a big deal.

71
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,850
Or if you,
you know,

72
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:22,180
eggs and fish and chicken.
Once I did that,

73
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:25,570
I said I'm going to go back to fishing,
which it did as a kid.

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,580
And then I,
I live in a rural area,

75
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,700
you know,
I'm in the woods practically and I look

76
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,870
around was like,
hmm,

77
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,500
if I'm going to get protein,
animal protein,

78
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,580
there's some of that running around here
in the woods and it's still part of the

79
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:42,340
culture there where I live in Vermont,
you know,

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,700
hunting is still alive as part of the
culture.

81
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,630
So it started to sort of sneak up on me
as his idea to,

82
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,180
to get into hunting.
Wow.

83
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:52,660
Well

84
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,210
the eggs are an easy one because nobody
has to get hurt.

85
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,410
Like eating eggs is so easy if you,
especially I have my own chicken,

86
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,000
so it's just,
hey girls,

87
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,350
what's going on?
Take the eggs.

88
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,760
No one gets hurt,
everything's fine.

89
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,500
And um,
that seems to me to be the easiest and

90
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,770
most ethical way.
If you just want to get some animal

91
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,260
protein in your body,
that one really is no one,

92
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,940
no one's getting hurt.
Those things I didn't,

93
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:17,350
you know,
this is so embarrassing,

94
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:19,750
but I didn't even know.
I think I was in my late thirties,

95
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:24,751
early forties when I found out that
chicken eggs couldn't become a chicken

96
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,140
because a,
they weren't fertilized by a rooster.

97
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,490
Like this is how stupid I was or more,
more really removed from us.

98
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,410
Any farming or any idea of farming.
I just a from my,

99
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:43,810
in my stupid mine,
I just had this idea that,

100
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,100
and then I,
I've had a thing,

101
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,500
oh yeah,
of course there's still rooster and how,

102
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,690
wait a minute,
why are they laying eggs every day?

103
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,540
Like what the Hell is going on?
And I don't understand that part of it,

104
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,170
but um,
it's so easy to just get eggs from

105
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,100
chickens.
I mean,

106
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:01,120
as long as you're feeding the chicken,
chicken's exist off of so many different

107
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,310
things.
They cleaned your garden,

108
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,790
they run around there.
They mostly bugs and grass and chicken

109
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,290
in know healthy chicken food.
But once you decide you're going to pull

110
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,430
the trigger on a deer,

111
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,900
things get real.
That's a totally different experience.

112
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:21,901
Cause there's this one guy who's this
healthy ethical Vegan who's walking

113
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,980
around looking at the deer like hello
friend.

114
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,630
And the next day,
you know,

115
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,140
you're elbows deep in that deer pulling
out its guts,

116
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,160
hanging it up in a barn and taking the
skin off of it.

117
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,080
That's exactly right.
And it took me a few years from when I

118
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,620
started hunting too and I was learning
through email to my uncle and reading

119
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:52,240
articles and poking around in the woods
and there was a slow learning process

120
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,490
and there aren't tons of deer running
around Vermont.

121
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,350
There are some,
but I was not really,

122
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,000
no.
Back in the back in the sixties and

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,310
seventies,
we had all this young growth forest,

124
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,144
you know,
all these,

125
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,940
these uh,
farm fields that were coming back into

126
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:08,930
forest and there were a ton of deer.
It was really rich habitat for deer.

127
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,430
Now it's a much more mature forest.
And so the numbers have,

128
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:17,210
have really dropped down predators up
there where they have coyotes and bear.

129
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,750
But you know,
nothing that is really a good Predator

130
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,530
on adult dear.
Um,

131
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,670
so
I was trying to on but unsuccessful for

132
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,410
several years.
And in retrospect,

133
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,830
I'm really glad because I don't think I
was ready for that experience.

134
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,290
So you were saying,
I'm going to go hunting,

135
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,200
but you weren't getting anything,
so you're trying to find the deer.

136
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,780
So it was more like some deer by hiking
with a backpack that has a gun in it.

137
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,710
Yeah,
I mean,

138
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:47,420
I did a little bit of small game
hunting.

139
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:48,191
I took a,
you know,

140
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,790
a snowshoe Hare,
too small,

141
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,880
you know,
but a deer is a different experience.

142
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:53,780
You know,
something,

143
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,900
it's a mammal,
but something that big to,

144
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,940
um,
and you know,

145
00:06:58,941 --> 00:06:59,900
something that beautiful.

146
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,440
I mean,
they're,

147
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,460
they're stunning animals.
And so when it finally happened a few

148
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,160
years in,
it was a total shock.

149
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,340
The actual experience,
even though I'd seen someone else with a

150
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:11,450
deer,
they had just killed.

151
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:14,150
And I helped my uncle,
but doing it yourself,

152
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,510
different games.
And how did you prepare for this?

153
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:20,960
Did you take courses?
Did you train yourself?

154
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:23,300
How to shoot?
Did you already know how to shoot?

155
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,580
I had shot a bit as a kid.
I'd been around.

156
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,050
Firearms are up to you if,
sure.

157
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,010
Sure.
Um,

158
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,430
you know,
I'd been around firearms a little bit as

159
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:34,070
a kid.
I had never shot a deer rifle,

160
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,330
you know,
centerfire rifle.

161
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,460
So that was new.
Um,

162
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,290
but yeah,
it was learning from books,

163
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,910
articles,
my uncle,

164
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,430
a lot of emails back and forth.
You know,

165
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,880
I was totally clueless.
You know,

166
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,760
about firearms,
about deere,

167
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,594
about everything.

168
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,810
It was a starting from ground zero and
so slow.

169
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,270
It was slow.
That's a real commitment.

170
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,030
Like especially if you're doing it
essentially by herself,

171
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,951
you know,
to,

172
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:05,780
to,
to decide to really get involved in

173
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,150
quote unquote gun culture and uh,
understand what kind of round you need a

174
00:08:10,151 --> 00:08:12,200
rifle you need.
What's the best kind of rifle was the

175
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,850
best way to pull the trigger.
How do you,

176
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,690
how do you keep yourself from jerking or
punching the trigger and you know,

177
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:19,820
there's a lot of practice involved.
Oh yeah,

178
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:22,160
there is,
there's a ton to learn and I think

179
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:25,730
that's one of the interesting things
with what I call adult onset hunters.

180
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,530
Those of us who come to it later in
life,

181
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,270
it sounds like diabetes,
um,

182
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,180
onset hunters that we don't know a
million things that those people who

183
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:43,010
grew up doing it take for granted about
the woods,

184
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,720
about firearms,
about all kinds of things.

185
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,920
And they forgot they even learned them
cause they,

186
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,940
you know,
they learned it when they were 10 or 15.

187
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,510
Uh,
and we don't know any of that.

188
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,100
We've lived,
maybe

189
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,130
we've spent some time in the woods,
maybe we know something about fishing

190
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,890
or,
but we don't know that whole world.

191
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,140
So it's a challenge without a mentor.
So for me,

192
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:08,550
my uncle was really helpful.
Um,

193
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,090
but having a mentor is really key I
think for folks who come to it later in

194
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:13,140
life.
Yeah.

195
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,970
It's so much so that I was thinking that
there's gotta be some way to start a

196
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:21,450
program that teaches people the ethics
of it.

197
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,100
And boy,
it's,

198
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,240
it's so hard to do because you're
talking about something that reasonably

199
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:30,070
should take a long time before you
actually,

200
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,150
I think the way you did it,
taking a long time before you actually

201
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:35,100
shoot a deer,
it's probably the way to go.

202
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,980
I got a crazy crash course from Steven
Rinella,

203
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,060
right?
Um,

204
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:44,010
where I did his television show.
I shot literally a couple times at a

205
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:46,020
piece of paper and I'm not bullshitting.

206
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,180
We set up a target,
put it on like a,

207
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,650
a patch of dirt and a shot a couple of
times where he's explaining how you have

208
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,120
to squeeze,
you can't jerk it.

209
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,790
You have to squeeze and a,
then next thing you know,

210
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,820
I'm shooting a deer like five days later
or whatever it was.

211
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,410
It was a very strange,
and it took me a while to sort of let

212
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:09,060
all the information set in and then get
my skills up to like,

213
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:12,360
I pulled it off the first time,
but I easily could have fucked up.

214
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,130
I easily could a wounded animal.
I,

215
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,330
you know,
I really wasn't ready,

216
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,180
um,
to get someone,

217
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,590
especially someone with a fulltime job,
someone with a family obligations to get

218
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,770
them somehow another set up,
some sort of a course that allows them

219
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:27,290
to learn how to do that.
Right.

220
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,010
Well,
there's demand for it.

221
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,810
And yes,
there are a bunch of states that are

222
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:32,700
doing it.
They're like Wisconsin,

223
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,350
Minnesota,
have really good programs,

224
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,850
adult learn to hunt programs and they do
it over the course of like six or nine

225
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:42,260
months.
You have an intro workshop usually at

226
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:47,190
the local food co op or something.
It recruit people there and then they

227
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,150
end up,
um,

228
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,180
having these weekend sessions throughout
the course of the year.

229
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:54,750
And it culminates with a sort of a
mentor at hunt on public land in,

230
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,300
um,
in Wisconsin or Minnesota or other

231
00:10:57,301 --> 00:11:00,090
states that have similar programs.
But there's enough demand that there are

232
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,410
private courses.
I mean,

233
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:06,240
there's work we can workshops being
offered by folks I know not associated

234
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:10,560
with the state program at all,
just teaching people because they didn't

235
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,240
learn.
And there's a huge demand,

236
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:13,800
I think,
not just for hunting,

237
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,680
but people want these old skills,
you know,

238
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,720
hands on,
you know,

239
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:23,721
whether it's how to physically build
something out of wood or had a can your

240
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,620
own food or how to,
you know,

241
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,420
hunt and butcher a deer and there's an
interest in that sort of do it yourself.

242
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,110
Uh,
quote unquote primitive or just basic

243
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,590
self-reliant skills.
Yeah.

244
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:36,990
I mean,
even if you're not thinking about being

245
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:38,040
a prepper,
if you're not,

246
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,600
you know,
if you're not getting ready for the end

247
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:40,890
of the world,
it's still,

248
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,420
it's a fascinating thing to learn how to
take care of yourself and learn how to

249
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,420
get your own food from the actual
wilderness.

250
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,160
Right?
Or even or from the garden.

251
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,120
I mean,
just that hands on experience.

252
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:55,500
I direct experience is really different
from seeking sitting in a cubicle,

253
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,040
getting paid,
and then going and buying food at the

254
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,390
grocery store.
You know,

255
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,410
the,
the uh,

256
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,520
author Richard Nelson,
who's written great books about deer and

257
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:04,900
all kinds of things.
Um,

258
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,620
he lives up in Alaska and he calls the,
uh,

259
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,590
the supermarket an agency,
an agent of our forgetfulness,

260
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,130
and we forget where things come from if
we don't live on a farm,

261
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:16,540
if we didn't grow up doing that kind of
thing.

262
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,240
Yeah.
I think that's an issue that a lot of

263
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:23,770
people who have paid attention to all
the different videos that have been

264
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:28,390
released from these factory farms that
are horrific and they try to figure out,

265
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:30,160
well,
what is a way to get around this?

266
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,900
What's,
there's gotta be a way to get around

267
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,420
this.
And the most ethical way,

268
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,390
I think,
and a lot of people think is if it's

269
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:41,080
possible to hunt it yourself because
then you're getting an animal that was

270
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:43,630
never caged up.
It was a wild animal.

271
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,970
And in one brief moment,
it's life ends.

272
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,480
And realistically that life was probably
on its way out anyway.

273
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:52,600
If you're shooting a mature deer,
he shooting something that's six years

274
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:53,590
old,
five years old.

275
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,620
It's amazing that deer live that long in
the first place.

276
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,160
Yeah.
Most wild animals are prey.

277
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,140
You know,
most prey animals and even most

278
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,490
predators in fact,
you know,

279
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,810
die when they're pups basically.

280
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,780
I mean,
the mortality rate is incredibly high.

281
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,321
Yeah.
I mean,

282
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,840
even the mortality rate for bears is
insanely high.

283
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:14,670
And the Predator of bears is bears,
you know,

284
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,770
there's a bear's kill half of all the
moose calves and um,

285
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,350
and deer Fonz,
like half of them that get born get

286
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,470
killed by bears or coyotes or wolves or
anything.

287
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,360
So to get something that's five years
old,

288
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,960
you are,
you essentially stepping in just before

289
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,510
nature did.
Yeah.

290
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,840
I mean it's,
I don't know enough about all the

291
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:42,760
ecology and biology of all these species
to speak authoritatively on that side of

292
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:45,550
it,
but the idea of it being an ethical

293
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:47,800
alternative make sense to a lot of
people.

294
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:50,290
I think it resonates.
The people that I've interviewed who are

295
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,910
adult onset hunter is,
you know,

296
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,270
and from my own experience,
that's a pretty common theme.

297
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:59,080
There's an ethical drive involved,
whether it's practical for a huge

298
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,140
portion of the population to really do
that is a different,

299
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,290
you know,
statistical question.

300
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,490
It's just not,
but,

301
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:07,271
uh,
you know,

302
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:10,540
it's also not practical for the United
States to feed every country in the

303
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,760
world.
It's not practical for everyone to exist

304
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:14,540
off all the crops grown in England.
It's not private.

305
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,000
There's a lot of things that aren't
practical.

306
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,860
Exactly.
Not that those things do exist,

307
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:22,861
but what you can do as a human,
you can still today in the United States

308
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:25,120
and still learn how to hunt,
hunt,

309
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,610
and get all your food from that.
It is still possible.

310
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:29,740
It might not be possible for everybody
in the country to do it,

311
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,420
but guess what?
Everyone in the country is not going to

312
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:32,710
do in anyway.
It's like,

313
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:33,460
no.
You know,

314
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,440
like saying,
is it possible to write a book?

315
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,200
Yes.
It is.

316
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,870
Guess how few fucking people write
books.

317
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,020
You wrote a book.
How many people write books?

318
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,240
I mean,
you could go all day without meeting

319
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,030
anybody who's ever written a book.
You know,

320
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,410
um,
this book that you wrote,

321
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:49,090
the mindful carnivore,
um,

322
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,190
I don't think I've ever even seen a book
written

323
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,190
by a guy who started off as a vegetarian
and a Vegan and was compelled to,

324
00:14:58,851 --> 00:14:59,960
uh,
to become a hunter.

325
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,070
You know,
it seems when I first got into the idea

326
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,220
of writing a book,
which seemed crazy and still in

327
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,570
retrospect seems kind of crazy.
Um,

328
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,040
but when I started even writing a couple
essays about that,

329
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,460
about going from being a Vegan and
vegetarian to being a hunter,

330
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:19,270
I thought this is bizarre.
I don't know what people are going to

331
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,280
make of this.
Over time I've met more and more people

332
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:27,620
who have actually had a pretty similar
experience,

333
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,010
other vegetarians who became hunters.
And there's a,

334
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,160
there's a logic to it.
Like if you were that concerned about

335
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:41,591
animals that you decided to be
vegetarian or Vegan and then you changed

336
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,650
your diet,
animals are still a pretty serious issue

337
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,270
for you unless you just abandoned your
entire philosophy and left out the door.

338
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,540
If you still have those basic values and
you still take animal welfare and

339
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,630
environmental conservation and these
sorts of issues,

340
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:01,850
seriously,
then

341
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,730
there's a interest in engaging directly,
like confronting it,

342
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,260
right.
Instead of just saying,

343
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,350
oh well just go to the supermarket now
and just buy some ground chuck.

344
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,020
Right?
So for those of us who still have animal

345
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:22,190
ethics and welfare in mind,
when we make that transition out of

346
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,020
being vegetarian,
there's a,

347
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,220
there's a way to confront it.
You know,

348
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,700
I know some folks who were vegetarian,
young couple,

349
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,930
um,
and when their diet changed,

350
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,360
um,
they decided they're going to raise it

351
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:43,590
on animals instead of hunt started
raising chickens and

352
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,800
now they do it full time.
The chicken farmers,

353
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,910
chicken cows,
rabbits,

354
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,390
they run a,
a CSA community supported agriculture.

355
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,380
They supply meat to these two x
Vegetarians,

356
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,240
supply meat to this,
you know,

357
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,050
whole area up where we live.
So

358
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,360
they wanted to confront it directly.
It's just,

359
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,790
you know,
the same kind of thing.

360
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,800
They go,
if we're going to do this,

361
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:15,230
we're going to do it ourselves.
Now you say your diet changed,

362
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:17,300
like,
like it used to be spraying and now it's

363
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,690
summer.
Right now mean what does,

364
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,440
what does that mean you're diet changed
and why did you die change?

365
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,450
What was the reason?
Yeah,

366
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,430
I mean for me it was that my health was
iffy.

367
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,613
You know,
I wasn't in,

368
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,160
you know,
on death's door,

369
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,400
but my immune system was kind of
depressed and that sort of thing.

370
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,990
And several people,
including my wife and my doctor said,

371
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:43,130
you know,
maybe this is part of the picture,

372
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,830
you know,
think about your diet and start adding

373
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,290
some other things in.
And so when I started to add in some

374
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,190
eggs,
yogurt,

375
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,260
some local chicken,
that kind of thing,

376
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:53,700
it did change.
It really did.

377
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,250
So for me it was a,
it was a nutrition issue.

378
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,850
But is it possible that you just weren't
doing veganism correctly?

379
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,880
That's always the question,
you know,

380
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,710
that's always the question.
Um,

381
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,510
could I have done some things
differently?

382
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,250
Possibly.
What will you,

383
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,800
will you eating for your protein?
Well,

384
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,110
I mean,
I was eating plenty of what they used to

385
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,660
call sort of mixed,
you know,

386
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,480
you know,
you know rice and beans and veggies and

387
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,570
fruit and,
but even on very strict Vegan websites,

388
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,010
they'll say,
you know,

389
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:28,600
you need to take b12 something right
there.

390
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,030
There's things that are really hard to
get if you're not eating any animal.

391
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,290
Well,
some people deny that.

392
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:38,130
That's a really fascinating conversation
I've had with a friend of mine who's a

393
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:39,270
Vegan who says,
you know,

394
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:42,810
you really need very little b12 and you
can get plenty of b 12 from your diet.

395
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:43,921
I'm like,
boy,

396
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:45,660
that's um,
that's controversial.

397
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,270
Like for you to be real confident about
that.

398
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:50,100
I'm not,
I'm not sure that's necessarily correct

399
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:54,120
because I've seen both really strong
statements on both sides.

400
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:56,790
Really strong statements that you
definitely can't get it from your diet

401
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,250
and really strong statements that you
can and I don't know who to believe.

402
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Yeah.
I mean I'm known nutrition expert

403
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,950
either,
but it's primarily from animals though,

404
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,260
be 12 correct.
As I understand,

405
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:10,590
I mean flax seeds and there are ways to
think you can get it,

406
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:15,060
but whether it's that easy to assimilate
into your body and actually use,

407
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,580
I think it depends on the source and you
know,

408
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,680
there's a huge difference.
It traditionally,

409
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,830
as I understand it,
between a Vegan diet and the vegetarian

410
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,740
diet,
if you're eating some eggs or reading

411
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:26,910
some,
some dairy,

412
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,130
that's a different ballgame.
We have cultures and traditions of

413
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,460
vegetarianism around the world that have
sustained themselves.

414
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,330
I don't know of any communities and
cultures or traditions around the world

415
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,180
where they've been Vegan for generation
after generation.

416
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,560
I don't think,
I don't think it exists.

417
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,230
Isn't it possible though that it
requires more education,

418
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:52,680
more understanding about what the
nutritional requirements are like as far

419
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:54,840
as like mixing your proteins and making
sure,

420
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,920
cause we had some guys on from the
documentary cowspiracy and we talked

421
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,290
about,
and I really wish I'd read a little bit

422
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,810
more of a,
the arguments against what they were

423
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:08,340
saying before I had him on because uh,
one of the things we talked about is

424
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:12,570
like complete proteins and a complete
amino acid profiles.

425
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,880
They will,
there's very few complete proteins and

426
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,350
plant form.
It's very few.

427
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,800
And if you're getting like,
if you're trying to get all your protein

428
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,050
from Broccoli,
Jesus Christ,

429
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:25,830
you've got to eat like pounds of the
stuff in order to like,

430
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,060
and so I don't think it's one of the
things it becomes with a lot of people,

431
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,420
it becomes almost like you're talking
about their deity.

432
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,590
It's almost like a religious argument
because they don't want to be objective

433
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:40,860
about it in any one exception to that is
rich roll rituals,

434
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:42,510
very objective.
And uh,

435
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,670
I don't know if you know who he is,
he's a another name.

436
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,180
But again,
endurance athlete,

437
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,390
right?
Very good guy and has a great podcast

438
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:51,910
and he's been a guest on the podcast a
couple of times here.

439
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,410
Really cool guy.
But he's,

440
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,500
he's very non dogmatic and also,
uh,

441
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,790
not a judgemental guys.
No,

442
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,600
he's not.
No,

443
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,100
he's not preaching.
Um,

444
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,280
but for a lot of them they just don't
want to admit the difficulty in getting

445
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,440
complete sources of protein.
And,

446
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,140
and then there's a few Vegan
bodybuilders.

447
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,090
These are,
these people are hilarious.

448
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,980
You find out they're doing steroids.
Like Dick Dickhead.

449
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,460
Yeah,
no,

450
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,820
I don't think so.
But like Vegan bodybuilding is,

451
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:26,320
it's is fraud.
It's fucking infested with people that

452
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,570
are doing steroids that aren't being
honest about it,

453
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,060
that are getting gigantic that or you
know,

454
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:33,570
eating Vegan food and like Vegan power
and they're,

455
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,300
they're flexing,
you know,

456
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,510
meanwhile they've got fucking synthetic
testosterone,

457
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:39,220
which by the way,
it's made with yams.

458
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,550
You can make synthetic testosterone
isn't Mexican wild yams.

459
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,630
Yeah.
And in a way,

460
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:45,130
but it's,
it's just hilarious.

461
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:48,850
And they're attributing all this,
fucking scientists have made your body

462
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:49,684
man,
right.

463
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,680
Scientists in a weight room.
But you know,

464
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,241
there's,
you know,

465
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:58,390
that's neither here nor there,
but I think it's,

466
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,530
for some people it's,
it is very difficult if you're,

467
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:06,940
if you're going to be Vegan to get
everything your body requires.

468
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,890
You know,
you know who travis barker is the

469
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:11,230
drummer from blink one eight two really
cool guy,

470
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,780
got in a plane crash and a was burned
really badly.

471
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:17,400
He had a bunch of skin graphs and stuff
and uh,

472
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,710
it wasn't taking until he ditched his
Vegan Diet.

473
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,700
Who's having a real hard time healing?
And I hear things like that.

474
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:25,151
I go,
man,

475
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:28,570
what is going on?
Because how come some people can tell me

476
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,660
that they're doing so well,
they heal quicker,

477
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:35,110
they recover quicker on a Vegan Diet,
they feel better on a Vegan Diet.

478
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,320
And then other people are telling me,
you know,

479
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,750
it's just their body just wasn't healing
correctly.

480
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,930
Their immune system was floundering like
what's going on?

481
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:47,530
And I think part of it is probably that
we have,

482
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,770
our bodies are different.
We have somewhat,

483
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,360
I mean we're the same species,
we have basic profile,

484
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:55,930
but we have all kinds of end of the more
science progressed is looking at,

485
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,960
you know,
our microflora inside our bodies.

486
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,050
I mean we're all really different.
So it may be that we processed and need

487
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:07,000
things in different ways and there's,
for many people,

488
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,060
I think there's a real change in over
time.

489
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,710
So in a short period of time,
if you've been eating a really crappy

490
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:19,711
diet full of tons of fried food and then
you start eating a whole foods vegan

491
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:22,750
diet,
Lo and behold,

492
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:23,860
you're going to feel better,
right?

493
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,810
Because you're suddenly eating in
general,

494
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:26,950
healthier,
cleaner food.

495
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,890
Um,
after 10,

496
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:34,891
20 years for many people,
I think there are depletions and

497
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:39,480
consequences in the body of being strict
Vegan for all,

498
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,900
you know,
for that long period of time.

499
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,500
Did you attempt to talk to a
nutritionist and find out like are there

500
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,210
any foods that I should like keen

501
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,280
war things on hemp protein,
things that I need to mix in that or

502
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,590
pleat proteins?
I didn't really,

503
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,650
you know,
by that point because my,

504
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,470
those sort of black and white lines I
had drawn,

505
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:03,780
it was really rigid ethical ideas,
that sort of deity concept that I had in

506
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:08,781
a way and it's attachment to my identity
that had started to blur and loosened

507
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,321
enough.
It was like,

508
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:13,500
you know,
I live in this world,

509
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,840
not in some fantasy world.
I live here and even the local farmer

510
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:22,800
who grows our strawberries is smoke
Wyoming woodchucks and shooting deer and

511
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:27,300
he's eating venison and like I'm part of
this interconnected system,

512
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,260
you know,
this natural community of all kinds of

513
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,340
creatures,
plants,

514
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:35,430
animals.
I'm not separate from that.

515
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,610
And why do I,
why am I so fixated have I been for,

516
00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:44,070
you know,
this past decade so fixated on

517
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:49,670
separating myself from this world that I
actually inhabit?

518
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,410
I think not,
I'm not saying that's true for all

519
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:54,090
vegetarians.
They're all vegans by any means.

520
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:59,091
But for me there was in a sense a
desire to live in this ideal

521
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,910
philosophical world,
not in this like physical,

522
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:12,911
natural world that I actually inhabit.
I'm actually an animal that inhabits

523
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:15,530
this place.
I have a footprint here,

524
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,540
you know,
not just my carbon footprint comes with

525
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:18,240
the car.
I drive,

526
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,870
whatever,
but I have a physical footprint no

527
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:22,370
matter what I eat.
Right?

528
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,130
I'm impacting.
It's a whole network of connections,

529
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:27,260
you know,
through agriculture and all kinds of

530
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:29,210
ways.
I'm not separate from this.

531
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,130
Why don't I actually

532
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,133
eat

533
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:38,430
more of the kinds of foods that human
beings have been eating forever that we

534
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:39,940
evolved on,
you know?

535
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,870
And so I just start to experiment with
it and see both how it felt physically,

536
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,350
but also sort of emotionally,
ethically,

537
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,580
spiritually,
philosophically.

538
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:51,130
How did it feel to start to,
to do that?

539
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,420
And it was strange.
I mean,

540
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:54,910
it was a kind of a bizarre experience to
start to eat,

541
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,880
especially to start eating meat again.
It was weird,

542
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,680
even before I was hunting,

543
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,210
I can only imagine.
I think what's going on is all connected

544
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:08,240
to what your friend calls the supermart.
What did you call an agent of

545
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,470
forgetfulness?
Yeah.

546
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,810
I think it's connected to that in that
we are so disconnected from our food

547
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,070
that even people that are are vegans,
that you know,

548
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,520
they think that they're causing no harm
because they just eat plants.

549
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,310
If you're eating commercial grain,
you're,

550
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:27,950
you're a part of a massive widescale
death.

551
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,780
In fact,
it's probably,

552
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:34,781
there's probably more dead animals per
acre in if you're getting commercial

553
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:40,181
grain than almost anything when they,
when they grind up that grain to chew it

554
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:44,100
up and to turn it into like if you have
a corn wheat and they chop

555
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,040
all that stuff down,
those combines are indiscriminate.

556
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,480
They kill everything,
right?

557
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,340
I mean they've,
they've made some improvements in that,

558
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,870
you know,
over the decades.

559
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,570
But sure.
Small mammals,

560
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,630
birds,
and then there's also just the fact that

561
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:01,380
when you create something like that,
whatever natural wildlife would have

562
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:04,980
been there has been completely removed
and you turned it into this weird new

563
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:07,700
thing where it's a monoculture,
right,

564
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,560
where you're just growing soybeans or
you're just growing whatever,

565
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,400
whatever the hell it is.
I think that by not participating in it,

566
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,820
and by not participating in any aspect
of the gathering of the food,

567
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,550
you get this detachment from it and you
say,

568
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,503
you know,
hey,

569
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,660
I can remove myself from any cruelty.
And he had ethical concerns by just

570
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,900
establishing a cruelty free Vegan Diet.
Right.

571
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:34,950
And it becomes a lot easier to,
to think in those black and white terms,

572
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,630
either not there,
good,

573
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:37,381
bad,
you know,

574
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:40,620
it's very easy to separate that because
you don't experience it and realize,

575
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:42,870
oh,
plants eat animals,

576
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,120
animals eat animals,
then animals die and plants eat film.

577
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,190
It's all this whole system that
everything including us as part of,

578
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,500
yeah.
And we as a culture,

579
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,390
as a society for,
for,

580
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,520
you know,
decades,

581
00:27:56,521 --> 00:28:00,270
centuries have been various ways
separating ourselves from that through

582
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:02,130
industrialization,
um,

583
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,660
through,
you know,

584
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,640
just our ideas.
Again,

585
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:07,800
this is culturally specific.
Not every culture in the world thinks

586
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:11,100
this way,
but we do think of ourselves as very

587
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:12,600
separate.
And,

588
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:13,440
uh,
there's,

589
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,360
uh,
environmental philosopher,

590
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,320
uh,
who,

591
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,060
who's now passed on,
but,

592
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,710
uh,
her name was val plumwood.

593
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,370
She was in Australia and she talked
about this and she talked about how even

594
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,730
our practices around and our ideas
around our own life and death as humans

595
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,140
and how we bury ourselves in these
concrete boxes to sort of keep ourselves

596
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,660
from decomposing supposedly,
right.

597
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,740
I said like protect ourselves from death
and the idea of us being part of that

598
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,380
world in a physical way.

599
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,213
We actually,
you know,

600
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,380
ending up being food eventually she
thinks that we,

601
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:56,700
and I think,
I think she's right,

602
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,710
that we reject that as a culture.
We just,

603
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,450
we don't have room for that.
Right.

604
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,140
Well that's one of the things what we do
to our bodies we embalm than when we

605
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:06,750
sort of remove ourselves permanently
from the cycle,

606
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,510
which is really kind of fucked up.
Have some formaldehyde buddy.

607
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,070
I'm like,
why do we,

608
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,950
do we really need to stare at our dead
bodies?

609
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,850
Like sitting with perfect clothing on
and you know,

610
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,370
you're not dead.
It's just so fucked up that we,

611
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,570
I've only seen it a couple times,
but I remember when it was my

612
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:27,900
grandfather and now I was really close
to my grandfather.

613
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:31,020
So when I went to his funeral and I saw
him sitting there in that box,

614
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,330
and I realize how bizarre it was,
her,

615
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:34,740
first of all,
he's not there.

616
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,440
I'm like,
this is a shell does not my grandpa,

617
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,290
he's gone like this is some strange
thing.

618
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:45,291
And like they've pumped him full of all
this stuff so he doesn't stink because

619
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:48,550
the stinking is natural.
It's like that's what supposed to happen

620
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:50,980
to a person.
You were supposed to put them in the

621
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:54,490
ground and the bacteria eats them.
You fertilize the soil and make it

622
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:55,890
better for everything around.
Right.

623
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,460
And when we don't do that,
what do we do?

624
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:00,910
We burn ourselves to turn ourselves into
powder.

625
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,350
Right till fucking totally useless.
We're real weird with how we treat our

626
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:07,940
bodies and the concept of death.
Yeah.

627
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,340
Yeah.
It's totally true.

628
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,950
One of the things that I love to do with
people that have,

629
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,070
uh,
too much of a Disney view of animals and

630
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:15,550
like,
again,

631
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,290
you know,
I can't believe that you would hunt.

632
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,520
I can't believe you would kill deer.

633
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,580
Do you know that deer eat birds and
they'll go,

634
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:22,840
what?
Yeah.

635
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:25,690
Deer eat birds.
They just tell me a bizarre a,

636
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,780
I've seen a couple of those videos.
I mean probably pretty darn rare,

637
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:31,440
but they chase them.
They've been known to very,

638
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,940
again very rare,
but they've been known to like in the

639
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:38,430
shallows like whack fish and eat pretty
unusual behavior.

640
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,300
Most of the time they can't pull it off,
but when they can pull it,

641
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,830
it's like dear are designed essentially
to graze.

642
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,990
It's real simple.
They're the way they are,

643
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,020
but they'll take their food any way they
can get it and that is really hard for

644
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:56,560
people to believe like cows as well.
Like cows eat ground nesting birds all

645
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:59,050
the time.
There's videos of cows doing it and when

646
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,160
you show that to people,
they're like,

647
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:04,150
what the fuck is going on?
But maybe what we're doing is we're

648
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:07,480
ruining the earth so much that the
animals themselves are killing each

649
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:09,340
other and hating it and they've always
done this.

650
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,300
They just don't do it a lot because
they're just not designed for it.

651
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,300
And there's plenty of vegetation where
the deer live,

652
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,230
especially like white tail deer who live
primarily around agriculture.

653
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,040
They were around so much vegetation,
so much food that the last thing do you

654
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,830
have to worry about?
Most of the time it's starving to death

655
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:29,130
when they were around like farmlands and
stuff like that.

656
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,940
I mean up our way in the north and in,
in some other parts of,

657
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,240
of you know,
know the new s and up into Canada where

658
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:41,230
you get into mostly forested areas and
you get over populations of deer.

659
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,550
They wipe out their winter habitat if
they have too many deer and they're

660
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,820
starvation time is winter right there
because of the deep snow.

661
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:52,060
They're compressed into tiny,
tiny fractions of their usual usual

662
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:54,280
range.
And they can in fact,

663
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:56,770
you know,
starve to death and in vast numbers,

664
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,500
but around agriculture and more moderate
climates.

665
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,300
Yeah.
They've got no shortage of food.

666
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,170
Yeah.
And deer.

667
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,450
It's really interesting how they're set
up.

668
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,420
It's a,
it's almost like a,

669
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,130
it's making sure that they don't last
through when they're the older strong,

670
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:17,131
mature bucks cause a mature buck will go
from the prime of its life to on death's

671
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:21,670
door within a couple months during the
Rut.

672
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,070
And it's really crazy.
They drive them.

673
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:27,130
So they use all their fat reserves and
burn it,

674
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,230
and they're doing it right when the
winter's coming.

675
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,860
Right.
And sometimes bad design,

676
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,460
it's terrible,
but it's almost like it's on purpose

677
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,340
because for people who aren't aware of
the process,

678
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:40,040
what happens is the deer will eat all
throughout

679
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,873
the summer.
Uh,

680
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,511
the,
you know,

681
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:42,560
they'll,
they'll fatten up,

682
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,210
they look great,
their antlers grow.

683
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,090
And uh,
as soon as the air starts getting crisp

684
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,980
around the fall,
they get ready to party.

685
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,380
Um,
the velvet falls off their antlers,

686
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:53,660
their antlers start to get hard.
Um,

687
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,720
and then the females go into heat and
then the party starts and they just run

688
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:02,780
around running for so long that they
sometimes forget to eat.

689
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,380
They burn off all their fat and they get
skinny and scrawny,

690
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,290
and then by the end of it,
it's cold.

691
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,300
And when it's cold,
that's when they die.

692
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:16,301
So they'll go from being like a stud,
primary their life dear to being a dead,

693
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,860
starving to death,
frozen to death,

694
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,080
deer within a couple of months.
It's a really weird,

695
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,610
and especially in,
you know,

696
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,380
in those kinds of harsh climates where
it's,

697
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,640
where it is cold,
deep snow,

698
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:27,890
limited food,
it can be really risky.

699
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,290
Yeah.
Like the like mule deer in particular,

700
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:30,951
right.
Because,

701
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:31,641
um,
I know,

702
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:33,470
I don't know,
I know what happens to white tails but

703
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,240
may happen with mule deer as much or
more.

704
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,120
Well,
it's just a nature almost has like these

705
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:41,540
fail safe system set up to make sure
that these mature bucks only have their

706
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,770
time in the sun for so long.
You know,

707
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,000
you get your party on all the,
all the females love Ya,

708
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,540
you're having a great time,
you father a lot of offspring and then

709
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,433
that's a wrap.

710
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,880
Yeah.
One of the things that I find

711
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,540
fascinating is that
different groups,

712
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,790
vegetarians,
hunters and others who often seem

713
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,570
diametrically opposed on,
on an issue like hunting,

714
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,380
um,
often are motivated by really similar

715
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:19,550
values.
I mean,

716
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:24,140
a concern for environmental
conservation,

717
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:28,160
a concern for even animal welfare.
I mean in hunting,

718
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,970
the ethic of the clean kill,
the,

719
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:36,130
the idea that you should only shoot
wants and it should be virtually

720
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:37,310
instantaneous.
You know,

721
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,300
and even the concern that you express
your,

722
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:42,680
Gee,
I got this crash course so fast,

723
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,750
I could have wounded an animal.
You know,

724
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:49,250
the concern about wounding an animal is
a concern about,

725
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,230
you know,
not causing suffering,

726
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,820
you know,
undue suffering,

727
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:54,420
not,
um,

728
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,100
violating essentially an animal welfare
ethic.

729
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,960
Right.
Um,

730
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,250
and that
there's such different languages being

731
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:05,950
spoken often by,
you know,

732
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,680
folks who are on a sort of an animal
rights or animal welfare activist side

733
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:16,970
and folks who are on sort of a hunting
and hunting conservation activist side

734
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:17,804
of things.
And,

735
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,090
and often they're speaking very
different languages and don't realize

736
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:22,420
that they have some things in common.
Uh,

737
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,690
you had,
uh,

738
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,980
back at the beginning of January,
you had,

739
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,890
is it filled?
Demars the guy with the greenland.

740
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,620
Greenland,
exactly.

741
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,820
Yeah.
So he's an animal rights activists doing

742
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,000
really important work related to,
you know,

743
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,290
orcas and other captive captive animals.
Um,

744
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:43,550
and he has a real respect for and gets
where you're coming from in your

745
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:44,940
interest in hunting.
Yeah.

746
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,550
You know,
and so there are people who do get it

747
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:48,840
across those,
you know,

748
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,490
those,
he's different.

749
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,200
First of all,
I'm pretty sure he eats meat.

750
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,930
Didn't he say he eats meat?
I think he may be,

751
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,710
but also on top of that,
he's,

752
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,990
we're talking about marine mammals that
are super intelligent and I have,

753
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,970
I have a deep appreciation and respect
for those things.

754
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:11,250
And I think they're basically like water
people.

755
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,590
I really do.
I just think they don't fingers,

756
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,940
they don't have a language that we can
really accurately interpret.

757
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:23,270
But when you pay attention to Helen,
insanely smart dolphins and orchids are,

758
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,780
to me,
locking them up is akin to a slavery.

759
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,990
It's almost like slavery.
It's insanity.

760
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,480
I just despise it.
I think it's sick.

761
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,370
It costs me money because a,
there's the best comedy room in Vegas is

762
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:43,200
in the Mirage and I won't work it.
I've done it in the past and then I was

763
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,020
told that the Mirage has dolphins and I
was like,

764
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,430
ah,
fuck man,

765
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,860
I can't work there.
I just can't.

766
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,760
I can't,
I can't,

767
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,400
I can't do comedy.
I can't have a fucking,

768
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:56,700
he,
he and Aha show a above a slave ship.

769
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,150
And that's what it feels like.
Sure.

770
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,440
But that idea that there are water
people.

771
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,090
Yeah.
It's interesting because in many

772
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,730
traditional hunting societies,
they speak of animals as people you

773
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,910
know,
and have them as,

774
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,960
and even deer,
you know,

775
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,790
they have,
if a society,

776
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:18,510
it's not the same say as a dolphin pod
or a wolf pack,

777
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:21,960
it's a different,
but they know those animals really

778
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:25,650
intimately as a species and sometimes
even as individuals,

779
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,870
but the language,
the idea of them as,

780
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,370
as other people,
as,

781
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,720
as animal people.

782
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,290
And yet they're hunting cultures,
you know,

783
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:36,180
and so they're,
they're taking lives.

784
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,760
Uh,
but they're also have a deep respect.

785
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,370
It's not that Obo will kill the ones we
don't respect.

786
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,680
What were the kill the ones that are
kind of ugly.

787
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,900
But the ones that we respect are the
ones that are beautiful.

788
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:47,430
We won't touch.
That's not it.

789
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,810
That's not how they're thinking about
it.

790
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:51,750
Yeah.
And we often do my agent,

791
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,060
I have an agent and I love her to death.
She's awesome.

792
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,940
But she loves animals.
She's vegetarian,

793
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,220
she loves animals.
But she doesn't mind if I hunt wild

794
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:00,690
pigs.
Cause there's disgusting,

795
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,440
ugly and disgusting was art.
There's this arbitrary aesthetic that,

796
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,920
that some people will say,
well,

797
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:10,200
you know,
it's an ugly kind of fish or it's an

798
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:13,080
ugly kind of mammal where any kind of
fish really,

799
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,110
there's very few people give a fuck if
you kill a fish,

800
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,460
they just really don't care.

801
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,360
Right.
It's,

802
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,500
and it's a different experience.
Yeah.

803
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,390
Emotionally.
Yeah.

804
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,450
It's totally different and it is,
but it is,

805
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,220
we,
it is weird and moving.

806
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:26,770
I mean,
oh,

807
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,830
here's a tangible sense of a loss of
life.

808
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,230
That was,
I was big into fishing when I was a kid,

809
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,680
when I was probably like,
um,

810
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,580
I guess I moved to Boston when I was 13.
That's when I really got into fishing

811
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,950
and I used to fish every day.
I used to live in this place called

812
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:46,951
Jamaica plain and they had this lake,
they're called Jamaica pond and uh,

813
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:50,950
they had bass and trout and I loved it.
I'd go there every day and I'd catch

814
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:53,730
fish there all the time.
And whenever I killed one and 82,

815
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,880
I always felt weird.
Like I just killed some.

816
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,591
Right.
I mean,

817
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:59,380
that was the experience that actually
made me decide to be vegetarian.

818
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,540
I fished all my childhood growing up.
Loved it.

819
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,351
My,
My,

820
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:04,390
uh,
fishing mentor was a guy from Boston who

821
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:08,020
grew up in the bronx and he was a,
he was a furniture builder in Boston.

822
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:10,600
And he come up and visit us in southern
New Hampshire and we'd,

823
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,160
you know,
we'd fish all the time,

824
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,580
but when I was 20,
I had been thinking a lot about,

825
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,410
you know,
what kind of life I wanted to leave,

826
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:19,630
what my values,
and I went fishing and I caught this

827
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:20,890
trout and I killed it.
And I was like,

828
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,810
I didn't have to do that.
Right.

829
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,200
I didn't have to kill that.
I could have had,

830
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,610
you know,
rice and veggies or whatever.

831
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,320
Well,
that I didn't have to.

832
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:32,530
It was one of the big arguments that
people even say against hunting,

833
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:34,600
even if they eat meat,
you can go to the supermarket.

834
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,990
You don't have to kill it.
Right.

835
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,360
It's the voluntary participation that
for some people is hard to fathom.

836
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,440
Now,
do you get all your meat from hunting

837
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,770
all my red meat?
If we have red meat,

838
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,900
I mean we'll buy local chicken,
you know?

839
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,120
Um,
but if we happen to have red meat in the

840
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,580
house,
it's because I was lucky the previous

841
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:57,250
November and you won't go to these
people that,

842
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,770
you know,
that raise chickens and cows and

843
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,950
I could,
and there's just,

844
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,320
there's no really good rational argument
for it.

845
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:08,470
I just never got back into the habit of
like buying beef.

846
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,480
Right,
right,

847
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,380
right.
Ecologically and ethically,

848
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:14,140
it probably makes pretty good sense.
You know,

849
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,360
and I have,
I don't have a big argument against it.

850
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,510
I just never got into that,
back into that habit.

851
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,930
Um,
so the experience of taking a deer is so

852
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:30,040
profoundly different,
obviously from going to the grocery

853
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,470
store or even go to a farmer,
you know,

854
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,390
um,
and having that is so valuable to me.

855
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,940
Um,
and it's such a reminder,

856
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:43,270
you know,
talk about the opposite of the

857
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:46,150
supermarket as an agent of
forgetfulness.

858
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,700
You know,
when you take a package of innocent or

859
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:53,200
the freezer and you remembered that deer
that you killed,

860
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,560
I mean,
there's no forgetting where that comes

861
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:57,540
from.
Oh yeah,

862
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,410
no,
it's always present.

863
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,620
Yeah.
It's indescribable to someone who hasn't

864
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:03,880
experienced it.
It's very,

865
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,620
very difficult to,
uh,

866
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,360
to even imagine what it's like because
there's some,

867
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,550
I mean,
I hate to use the word spiritual because

868
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:16,660
it just gets so beaten down and overused
and watered down.

869
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,730
But there is a weird spiritual
connection between your meat or a

870
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:24,180
tangible,
um,

871
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,940
energy.
It's connected to the experience that

872
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:29,890
you had,
the meat that you're eating,

873
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,950
the knowledge that you were the one who
took the life of the knowledge.

874
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,190
It was a life,

875
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,780
it was a living being and now it's food
on your plate and you're watching your

876
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:40,700
family eat it.
When you're having friends that come

877
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:42,950
over and eat it.
It's,

878
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,900
it's,
I just think that cities are something

879
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:51,980
really unusual and alien and a,
I think human beings have created them

880
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,790
out of convenience and it's wonderful
and it's allowed us to gather

881
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:59,840
information and to create these
incredible places where you can just

882
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:02,780
group together millions and millions of
people and you just ship all the food

883
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:05,090
in.
But in doing so,

884
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,690
we've created this really convenient way
of looking at things.

885
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,350
And I think this is what I'm trying to
get at with this whole series of

886
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,320
interviews and series of conversations
that I'm having with different hunters,

887
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,910
different vegans,
different,

888
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,610
there are different people that are
trying to ethically source their food.

889
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm trying to get a sense of how the
hell this happened and how it's so

890
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:30,470
pervasive and how there's so much
resistance to understanding and

891
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:32,780
appreciating what the,
the,

892
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:36,470
the overall what the really big picture
of where our food comes from.

893
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,200
Uh,
what it actually is instead of this a

894
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,930
utopian view that I think like we were
talking about,

895
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:46,760
you had this idea before separating
yourself from this world of animals and

896
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:50,020
it's not just food obviously.
I mean every material that a city that

897
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,770
the city uses,
water,

898
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,790
huge issue here in California.
Huge issue in Atlanta,

899
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,290
Georgia.
Huge issue in many places.

900
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,880
That water's coming from somewhere else,
every material that,

901
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:05,450
that city uses.
Very little as being produced actually

902
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,910
the raw materials coming from that
location.

903
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,580
So we're constantly drawing on rural
areas,

904
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,830
you know,
far flung around the globe sometimes,

905
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:17,510
but certainly the immediate surroundings
and cities are utterly dependent on

906
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,070
that.
Yes.

907
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,430
And um,
plastic and then waste products.

908
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:23,210
And then,
you know,

909
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,170
I have a friend who's a surfer as a Yoga
teacher and he loves surfing and he's,

910
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,630
he's a real interesting cat,
kind of a free spirit.

911
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,790
Um,
but he told me,

912
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,560
uh,
he's lived all over the world and um,

913
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,630
it's kind of very bizarre accident cause
it's like a combination of like a bunch

914
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:42,110
of different places where you live for
10 years here in Argentina for 10 years

915
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:46,220
and he serves everywhere.
He went surfing in Los Angeles.

916
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:51,221
He went surfing in Malibu after the rain
and didn't know that you can't do that.

917
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:56,770
Like you can't because there's so much
waste that comes from our cities.

918
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,500
When it rains,
it pours into the ocean and it's like

919
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:05,501
you're bathing in a toxic soup.
So he was sick for days just from

920
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,140
surfing in the water right off our
shores.

921
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,480
Just from all these chemicals and paths
sloughing off,

922
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,150
landing all the oil,
all the,

923
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,970
the,
the residue brake dust residue that's on

924
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:18,380
the roads,
all of that.

925
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:21,320
When you have a pouring rain that comes
down that La River and it just goes

926
00:44:21,321 --> 00:44:22,310
right into the ocean.

927
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,130
It was just,
they say for like five or six days,

928
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:26,600
you're supposed to stay out of the
ocean.

929
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,870
It takes a while to filter all that
stuff out and get it back to the where

930
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,520
the state that it normally is at.
But you know,

931
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:37,170
we live in this really dirty gross,
polluted city that's right next to this

932
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:40,140
beautiful ocean and there's
consequences.

933
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

934
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,760
When you took your first year,
was that,

935
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,600
what was that like as an experience?
Shocking.

936
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,640
Strange.
Um,

937
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,860
a definite tangible feeling of loss,
you know,

938
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,270
the loss of this life,
but also a,

939
00:44:57,271 --> 00:45:02,271
an incredible feeling of exhilaration,
this weird primal connection when you're

940
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:05,040
actually eating the meat over a
campfire.

941
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,170
Cause we did it,
you know,

942
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,560
hardcore back country,
back country,

943
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:15,480
public land in Montana.
Off the Missouri River camping,

944
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:17,460
like the whole deal.
We did it the right way.

945
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,990
And uh,
you know,

946
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,260
you're around a campfire with a bunch of
people that you really care about and

947
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,580
you're all eating this meat from this
animal that you just killed isn't tense.

948
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,480
And it's,
it is the male bonding experience,

949
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,470
you know?
I mean,

950
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,730
this is like,
there's,

951
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,250
there's like football games.
Oh yes,

952
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,170
it's fun.
But hunting,

953
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,370
going out and hunting parties together.
I had a conversation with my friend

954
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:44,100
Duncan trussell yesterday about this,
that I think that there's some things

955
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:45,750
that we,
um,

956
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,140
don't know that we have a requirement
for in our minds or in our bodies or in

957
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:53,970
our,
and maybe perhaps in our DNA that our

958
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,270
bodies are set up with these certain
reward systems.

959
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,670
It's rewarding to gather up your own
food.

960
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,560
And Pete,
anyone who's ever grown a garden

961
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:05,310
completely outside of hunting gardening
is super satisfying.

962
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:09,300
It's amazing when you eat some food that
you've grown yourself.

963
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:13,380
When you're chopping up some Kale and
tomatoes and you're making a nice salad

964
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,950
and you made all this,
you grew all this yourself and you paid

965
00:46:16,951 --> 00:46:19,350
attention to it,
you fertilized it and you added water.

966
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,610
There's this amazing feeling like the
exubera ration,

967
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:28,050
this like weird exhilaration feeling
when you're eating food that you grew

968
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,740
yourself.
And these things I think are these

969
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:36,150
reward systems that are in place because
it was always good to do that because it

970
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:38,190
ensured survival.
Just like helping other people.

971
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:39,930
That feeling of that good feeling,
you get.

972
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:42,390
Sure.
Helping others in your community.

973
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,190
Absolutely.
Helping us.

974
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,940
And also I'm hunting I think is in
there.

975
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,890
So it was,
but there's a bunch of weird things that

976
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,320
are in there too.
Um,

977
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,380
you know,
being uh,

978
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,660
sexually attractive is,
is in there too.

979
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:59,220
Having someone think you're attractive.
Like that's a normal primal reward

980
00:46:59,221 --> 00:47:03,120
system that we all love.
And even people that are in committed

981
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:04,950
relationships,
like women in committed relationships

982
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:08,640
like to go out with their girlfriends
and dress up and look nice to get looked

983
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:10,260
at.
They do,

984
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,270
I mean,
they might not have any desire to find a

985
00:47:12,271 --> 00:47:15,270
new man,
but they want to get looked at because

986
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:19,290
it fulfills these primal reward systems
that are in our,

987
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,010
in our bodies.
And I think archery is in there too.

988
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,410
I'm,
and I definitely think hunting and

989
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,710
eating your own meat from an animal or
from a fish or something that you've

990
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:30,130
gotten

991
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,620
and pulled from the wild.
One of the things about,

992
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,300
you know,
you say it's a male bonding experience.

993
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,400
One thing that's fascinating is that in
the,

994
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:39,640
so many of the old mythologies,
the,

995
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,530
the deity of hunting is a goddess.
Well,

996
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,350
the earth itself,
right?

997
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,470
I mean Artemis and Diana,
you know that women,

998
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,450
and I know many,
many women who hunt and they,

999
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,260
you know,
have a,

1000
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,410
just like men have a wide range of
experiences and views and values and

1001
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:58,390
attitudes toward it.
Um,

1002
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,050
but you know,
they of course also have this experience

1003
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,850
of,
of giving life,

1004
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:06,400
you know,
but they're actually mothers or not.

1005
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:08,210
They have this potential.
Uh,

1006
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,320
and,
and the combination of that,

1007
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,750
um,
plays out differently for different

1008
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:14,431
women.
But,

1009
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:17,440
uh,
to both be a giver of life and a hunter

1010
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,760
and a taker of life,
you know,

1011
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,180
talk about being sort of spiritually
connected to the world and to life and

1012
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:23,014
death.

1013
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,790
Yeah.
The giver of life thing,

1014
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,910
excuse me.
It's something that men will never

1015
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,410
really,
truly understand.

1016
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,580
There's no way.
I mean,

1017
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:33,940
I have this whole bit I'm doing about it
in my act because we will never

1018
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:38,050
understand what it's like to even have a
desire to have a baby in your body.

1019
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,910
I mean,
that's so alien.

1020
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:44,770
So alien to us.
And I think the earth itself,

1021
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,990
the,
the thought that the earth and that

1022
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:50,290
nature itself is a woman,
that nature itself is a mother,

1023
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:54,520
a mother that provides mother,
that gives life and gives birth to life.

1024
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,170
I mean,
it totally makes sense.

1025
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,410
Women hunters.
It's a very interesting thing because

1026
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:04,740
Steve Rinella wrote this really
interesting article about sexism in the

1027
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:11,041
way we perceive hunters because a,
there was this cute girl who was going

1028
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,540
on these,
uh,

1029
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,410
African Safaris and taking photos with
these animals that she had shot.

1030
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,370
And,
and,

1031
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:21,280
uh,
all these people are so angry at her.

1032
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,910
And this was pre cecil the lion.
And so,

1033
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:26,580
um,
he had this take on it.

1034
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:28,690
He was like trying to figure out like,
what is with all this hate,

1035
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,230
like where's all this hate coming from?
And he believes that a certain

1036
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:36,010
percentage of it is just sexism.
Is that someone looking at this girl,

1037
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:37,960
like,
why is this girl going over there and

1038
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:40,030
shooting a Kudu?
Like why does she do that?

1039
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:42,160
Why does she even want to do that?
Then beautiful animal.

1040
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:43,780
Why did she want to go over there and
shoot that?

1041
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:46,660
And that if it was like some fat old,
ugly dude,

1042
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,150
nobody would care.
But because it was this pretty,

1043
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,670
I think her name was Kendall Jenner.
Joan's Kendall,

1044
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,920
Kendall Jones,
Kendall Jenner's like one of the

1045
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,240
Kardashians.
Right.

1046
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,580
Probably.
So,

1047
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:58,740
you know what I'm talking about it.

1048
00:49:58,930 --> 00:49:59,920
Yeah.
And she,

1049
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:03,610
you know,
she had death threats and got hundreds

1050
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,680
of thousands of facebook likes.
I think she's probably got more facebook

1051
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:07,610
friends than I do.
Um,

1052
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,680
and it was all really quick and really
fascinating.

1053
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:14,060
How many pete,
but just turned out and uh,

1054
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,080
and attacked her and you know,
the hunting community supported her and

1055
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:18,500
a lot of ways,
but the,

1056
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,050
the,
the hateful people,

1057
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:23,920
the things that I would read about it,
a good portion of it was that she

1058
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:26,050
doesn't have to do this.
If you want to eat meat,

1059
00:50:26,051 --> 00:50:28,040
you can go to a store.
I saw that stuff.

1060
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,230
Sure.
The fly flyer and there's a,

1061
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,330
there's a lot of really good arguments
for that.

1062
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:33,200
First of all,
not,

1063
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:34,490
not that you,
if you want to get meat,

1064
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:36,110
you go to store.
But for real,

1065
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:38,540
if you're going to fly all the way to
Africa to get meat,

1066
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,970
that's,
there's no eco friendly in what you're

1067
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:41,804
doing.
Yeah.

1068
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,850
I mean,
if you're going to get a jet and you're

1069
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:47,510
gonna fly 16 hours across the ocean to
go get meat,

1070
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,920
let's be honest about what we're doing
here.

1071
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,030
We're having fun.
Right.

1072
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,470
Okay.
And I mean,

1073
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,060
I think the,
you know,

1074
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:58,270
like Steve or no,
I remember that article by Steve and I

1075
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:02,110
think that there are a whole bunch of
different things going on in a situation

1076
00:51:02,111 --> 00:51:04,870
like that.
There's the

1077
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:09,340
perception,
um,

1078
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:12,220
of hunting,
particularly,

1079
00:51:12,221 --> 00:51:15,370
so called trophy hunting or so called
sport hunting.

1080
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:17,680
And the language is really problematic,
right?

1081
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,760
Um,
that it is about us,

1082
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,490
you know,
and I say us,

1083
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,690
you know,
the hunters who do that,

1084
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:27,610
who I going to fly to Africa,
I don't,

1085
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,140
I never done that and don't intend to,
but,

1086
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:33,700
but a hundred and flies to Africa and is
whether they're hunting lions or kudu or

1087
00:51:33,701 --> 00:51:38,290
whatever they're hunting,
they're clearly not hunting that.

1088
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,640
So they have food,
right?

1089
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,290
Right.
So that ethic of respecting life and

1090
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:47,140
therefore you take life for a serious
purpose,

1091
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:51,730
including food.
That's an ethic that actually not just

1092
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,870
in,
uh,

1093
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,330
those who are criticizing trophy
hunting.

1094
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:57,130
But in hunting traditions,
you know,

1095
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,820
there are many wanton waste laws in many
states.

1096
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:03,130
You cannot kill a deer and just leave it
there,

1097
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,420
right?
Even if you have a hunting license,

1098
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:05,440
it's illegal,
right?

1099
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,230
That's understood as wrong.
Right?

1100
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,180
And there are many traditional hunting
prayers from hunting cultures where

1101
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,313
it's,
you know,

1102
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,210
I took your life because I needed

1103
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,990
the food,
the hide,

1104
00:52:15,991 --> 00:52:17,060
et Cetera,
you know?

1105
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,630
Um,
so that basic respect for life and also

1106
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:22,460
like in the Cecil case,
you know,

1107
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:27,490
there was the fact that he was shot and
then 40 hours later killed the animals

1108
00:52:29,591 --> 00:52:30,890
suffered.
It was not a clean kill.

1109
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,940
Right.
Uh,

1110
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:36,140
and there was outrage over that,
that that ethic also is part of hunting

1111
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:38,500
culture.
You don't do that well,

1112
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,700
you also don't leave,
you know,

1113
00:52:40,701 --> 00:52:43,150
you don't take the head and leave behind
the rest of the body.

1114
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:45,680
And it's one of the things that Rinella
said about line on thing.

1115
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:46,970
He's like,
if I shot a lion,

1116
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,090
I would eat that line.
And you can eat align I guess.

1117
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:50,931
Right.
I guess,

1118
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:52,190
you know,
they're edible,

1119
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,090
but,
well he has this,

1120
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:54,700
I'm sorry.
No,

1121
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,780
I'm just saying that there are these
values about respect for life and about

1122
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:05,561
animal welfare and suffering and so on
that are seen as being violated by

1123
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,000
situation.
Likes the salt or by,

1124
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:09,530
you know,
other hunters,

1125
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,410
Kendall Jones or others who go over.
It's like you didn't need to do the,

1126
00:53:13,411 --> 00:53:14,360
why are you doing that?
You're not,

1127
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,220
you just,
you're not using it yourself,

1128
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:16,770
you know?
Well.

1129
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,470
So does that,
to put it,

1130
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,080
Africa is one of the problematic place,
but to,

1131
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:22,370
um,
just to be,

1132
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:25,230
in all fairness,
a lot of people go to New Zealand and

1133
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:25,980
they hot over there and they

1134
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,570
do bring back the meat is still
ecologically you're flying in a plane,

1135
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:31,404
you know,
it's,

1136
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,820
you know,
it's really kind of re,

1137
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:35,430
but it is an ethical way to acquire
meeting.

1138
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:37,950
In fact,
a lot of the lamb and most of the elk

1139
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:40,320
that you buy commercially in America
comes from New Zealand.

1140
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,020
So the import elk from there,
I didn't know that.

1141
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,280
Yeah,
it's interesting.

1142
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,950
There's deer,
elk or red deer.

1143
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:50,610
A lot of venison comes from New Zealand.
Lamb comes from a lot of lamb comes from

1144
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:51,780
New Zealand.
They don't have any predators.

1145
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:54,780
So if you ever been over there,
have you ever watched a video about it

1146
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:55,291
last night?
I mean,

1147
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:58,260
they have fucking enormous herds of
sheep.

1148
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,760
I mean,
he'd never seen anything like,

1149
00:53:59,761 --> 00:54:02,730
it was insane and elk and uh,
uh,

1150
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,200
well not elk,
stags,

1151
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,940
red deer,
deer.

1152
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,090
And they have so many of them and that
they,

1153
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:12,270
it's really easy to go over there and
shoot them because they don't have any

1154
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,100
predators.
There's no predators there.

1155
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,930
And all the animals had been imported
there.

1156
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:16,610
So,
you know,

1157
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:19,770
New Zealand is a very strange place
cause it's almost like a paradise.

1158
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,460
It's unbelievably large.
I've seen footage of it.

1159
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,420
I haven't either,
man.

1160
00:54:24,421 --> 00:54:25,620
I've only seen footage.
Uh,

1161
00:54:25,621 --> 00:54:28,410
I want to go just,
I'm not even in hunting just as a

1162
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:30,270
vacation.
I want to take my family over there and

1163
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:31,230
just check it out.

1164
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,570
Yeah,
it just looks so cool.

1165
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:38,230
But I think in addition to the sort of
trophy in sports issues,

1166
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,840
in terms of what is

1167
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,790
objectionable to a lot of people about
certain kinds of hunting,

1168
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:51,350
I think there also is in many cases,
not in the Cecil case,

1169
00:54:51,351 --> 00:54:52,650
obviously,
but in,

1170
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:53,510
in the case of,
you know,

1171
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:55,820
Kendall Jones and others,
there's also a gender issue.

1172
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,240
There's also an issue about women as
killers.

1173
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,630
Right.
You know,

1174
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:06,290
and I think that is even more
disturbing.

1175
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,160
I don't agree that that's the only
reason people jumped on it because

1176
00:55:10,161 --> 00:55:13,670
people jumped on the dentist too.
Uh,

1177
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,960
but,
but I think it also,

1178
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:18,740
it is troubling in a different way.
Dennis killed a lion that had a name and

1179
00:55:18,741 --> 00:55:22,670
that's where things got really weird.
Cause the anthropomorphization of these

1180
00:55:22,671 --> 00:55:27,671
animals that we've experienced in movies
and television shows and commercials and

1181
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,450
what have you.
That's,

1182
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:34,220
it gets real weird with people cause you
named something and all of a sudden they

1183
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:36,890
think that that,
that thing is like someone's pad or

1184
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:37,724
something.

1185
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,010
Yeah.
I think the naming has a,

1186
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,490
it certainly adds a dimension to it.
The fact that,

1187
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,230
you know,
turned out to be,

1188
00:55:45,231 --> 00:55:47,150
you know,
a famous lion.

1189
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,710
Um,
but you know,

1190
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:50,960
there've been other cases,
um,

1191
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,950
you know,
Donald Trump jr or you know,

1192
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,690
one of the trump sons was right.
You know,

1193
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,910
several years back.
Yeah.

1194
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:59,420
It isn't all trump jr and it wasn't a
named animal.

1195
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,310
No.
But still the,

1196
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,040
yeah,
the whole trophy.

1197
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,940
Right.
The image of trophies and you know,

1198
00:56:06,941 --> 00:56:08,030
you've got these,
you know,

1199
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,060
these skulls of,
of deer and elk you've taken.

1200
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:16,061
And I have some too
and there for me anyway,

1201
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:21,490
it's not a trophy in the sense of,
Oh look,

1202
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,790
here's what I did.
You know,

1203
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,010
it's some,

1204
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,520
you know,
some kind of macho proving,

1205
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,410
you know,
that I'm a hang up in the living room

1206
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:34,411
and show off.
It has some sort of totemic or a

1207
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,870
symbolic power,
you know,

1208
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,940
it reminds me of that hunt and it,
you know,

1209
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:41,470
I don't want them not to just throw it
away.

1210
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,320
It's something that I value and,
and,

1211
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,350
and respect.
Well,

1212
00:56:44,351 --> 00:56:46,300
it's art.
It can be seen as art.

1213
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,740
I think it's nature's art.
I mean,

1214
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,980
that's why I don't have anything that's
been taken care of.

1215
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:54,160
Like it's,
there's no stuffed things because

1216
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,080
they're not real.
Like if you look at,

1217
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,470
and I'm not knocking anybody that kills
an elk and wants to put,

1218
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:01,460
it's a quarter on their wall or
whatever,

1219
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:03,610
or put his head on their wall.
But the,

1220
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,350
the bodies,
when you see those things,

1221
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:10,060
it's a foam body and they tan the hide
and they stretched the hide over it and

1222
00:57:10,061 --> 00:57:10,930
it's,
it's so much,

1223
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,793
it's fake.

1224
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:15,430
These skulls are,
this is the actual skull of the animal.

1225
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,970
And to me that is,
it's a beautiful piece of art.

1226
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:22,080
It's a fascinating to me when I look at,
I mean that,

1227
00:57:22,081 --> 00:57:24,340
that's the mule deer,
the first animal I killed over to your

1228
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:27,160
left right there.
I look at that thing every day and I

1229
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:29,920
look at it and then every day I find
some new area on it.

1230
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:34,250
The just the design of the deer skull is
fascinating.

1231
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,020
And I mean,
I wouldn't ever shoot an animal just for

1232
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:41,680
its skull or just for its antlers,
but I would never leave it behind

1233
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:42,890
either.
You know,

1234
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,920
I would want to keep that too.
Right.

1235
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,020
And so,
you know,

1236
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:50,200
the,
the idea of trophy and the language of

1237
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:53,940
trophy and the symbols like cruelty is,
you know,

1238
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,810
that's troubling for people.
Yes.

1239
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:59,440
And I think it's important for hunters
to get better.

1240
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,900
And,
and Steven Ellis spoken about this too,

1241
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:07,110
to get better at
expressing what's meaningful about the

1242
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:11,590
experience of hunting.
What's meaningful about the meat as

1243
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:13,180
you've,
as you've spoken about a bit,

1244
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,170
what's meaningful about a skull or
something,

1245
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:19,210
you know,
what is it that is that is meaningful

1246
00:58:19,211 --> 00:58:21,460
and I,
I think people can actually understand

1247
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:26,461
that if we can move past just black and
white hunting's good or bad,

1248
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:29,440
trophy hunting is good or bad and that
kind of thing.

1249
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:30,760
No,
I think they can too.

1250
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,510
We're always going to have problems with
people that are really hardcore vegans

1251
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,240
that have they've,
and it's really interesting,

1252
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:42,640
I got in this conversation with someone
really recently about it where I found a

1253
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,300
bacon lettuce tomato sandwich on their
instagram page if they were talking all

1254
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:48,580
kinds of crazy shit about hunters.
And um,

1255
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,680
she told me that she's only been a Vegan
for seven months.

1256
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,850
She was like one of the most
outspoken,

1257
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,740
angry,
forceful,

1258
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,570
like every,
everything about it was like,

1259
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,300
like it must be done.
You must stop.

1260
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,590
This is a,
we're killing.

1261
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:05,920
You have a blt on your fucking instagram
page.

1262
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:07,030
Like,
what's happening here?

1263
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:09,110
What is this?
The causes that well,

1264
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:12,040
it's almost like when you get into
something for the first time,

1265
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:14,230
you can't shut the fuck up about it.
And uh,

1266
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,300
I've been guilty of that many times in
my life.

1267
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:19,480
If I got into a race car driving or
something like that,

1268
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:22,010
people in the podcast probably like,
will you shut the fuck up about race

1269
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,843
car driving?
Right.

1270
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,500
And it got to the point,
you know,

1271
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:26,230
with hunting,
there's a lot of that like,

1272
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,700
so to this day,
like I'll put this podcast hop and

1273
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:29,511
people go,
oh great.

1274
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:34,511
And other hunting podcast Zzz Zzz
I get it.

1275
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,100
I don't care.
I'm going to talk about what's

1276
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:40,640
interesting to me.
And also I think part of these podcasts

1277
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:45,641
is these things will last for as long as
they get shared and spread around in the

1278
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:47,750
digital form.
And I think these conversations are

1279
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,180
important right now.
I think this conversation,

1280
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:52,100
the conversation about where's your food
come from?

1281
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:55,070
What made you make these choices?
I think these are important

1282
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:58,580
conversations because I think the
disconnect and recognizing the

1283
00:59:58,581 --> 01:00:03,260
disconnect that we have between where
our food comes from and these attitudes

1284
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:07,250
that we develop and have a that we
really don't,

1285
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,070
don't have any problem with or we don't,
we don't think there's anything wrong

1286
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:15,071
with the way we're alienating people or
pointing out the flaws over the people's

1287
01:00:15,201 --> 01:00:17,690
behaviors and we're not looking at
herself.

1288
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:20,050
There's a blind spot there and then I
think this is,

1289
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:22,940
is a very important conversation because
like I said,

1290
01:00:22,941 --> 01:00:26,480
I think we've created something really
weird with cities,

1291
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:32,170
with cities and with with supermarkets.
We've created this really weird thing

1292
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,540
where for our entire history,
the,

1293
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:38,720
as long as people have been people we
knew where our food was kind of coming

1294
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:40,280
from,
he knew you went to a butcher,

1295
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:41,990
you got the food that butcher kill that
animal.

1296
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,210
He knew you go to a farmer,
he grew the vegetables.

1297
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:48,590
You knew that when they came ready to
yourself and those were that it was real

1298
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:51,620
clear and now it's not anymore.
Now it's real weird,

1299
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,140
right?
You go to a drive through and you give

1300
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:58,010
them paper and within seconds you get a
ground to animal sandwich and you're

1301
01:00:58,011 --> 01:00:59,570
eating it,
the whole,

1302
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:04,190
the whole process takes a minute and
you're eating something that's already

1303
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:08,990
cooked right and you're drinking this
vat of sugary liquid with ice cubes in

1304
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,070
it.
Like how the fuck the ice cubes,

1305
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:12,680
it's 95 degrees outside.
Where'd you get the ice?

1306
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:18,060
W W there's this weird sort of removal
from nature that we have and the natural

1307
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:24,341
process of collecting and gathering and
then enjoying the food that you've

1308
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:26,330
gathered.
Right,

1309
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:26,760
right.

1310
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,740
And for me,
the interest in reconnecting those

1311
01:01:31,741 --> 01:01:36,741
things and being aware of
where things come from and how they're,

1312
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:44,010
how they're connected.
That is what led me to be a vegetarian,

1313
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,640
but it's also 11 you'd be a hunter,
you know,

1314
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:51,270
wanting to understand and recognize the
connection and not turn away,

1315
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:54,660
you know,
and the turning away when people

1316
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:58,740
willfully like,
I don't want to know that willful

1317
01:01:58,741 --> 01:01:59,460
ignorance.
Yeah.

1318
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,130
That's the thing that bothers me.
I don't care if someone's vegetarian,

1319
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,440
Vegan,
if they hunt or not.

1320
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,240
That doesn't matter to me as long as
they're willing to at least look at what

1321
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,790
and how things are connected and look at
what's going on.

1322
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:16,170
One of the first reviews of,
of my book that was written was by a

1323
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:20,010
vegetarian and she,
that

1324
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,370
the book actually made her think about
going back to being vegan because she

1325
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,920
was disturbed,
you know,

1326
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:30,780
and she also said that she thought that
the author and she didn't know me,

1327
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,690
um,
would consider it a compliment to know

1328
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:37,920
that it led her in that direction.
And she was actually right because I

1329
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,760
wasn't trying to convert her into being
an omnivore or being a hunter.

1330
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,130
I was asking,
look at these issues,

1331
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,280
think about these values,
think about animals,

1332
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:49,230
think about nature,
think about our relationship with these

1333
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:53,160
things and you decide what you're going
to do in your personal life.

1334
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,250
You know,
and the fact that she could respect me

1335
01:02:56,251 --> 01:03:01,110
enough and anticipate that I would
respect her decision was great because

1336
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,630
she wasn't doing that willful ignorance
thing.

1337
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,020
You know,
I think we're lucky that there's so much

1338
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:08,610
confusion.
I really do.

1339
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:10,620
I think this is a fascinating time to be
alive.

1340
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,670
And I think we're lucky that everything
is so bizarre because it makes these

1341
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:18,000
conversations.
So the crackle because there's

1342
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:19,800
something,
something so weird about it.

1343
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,060
There's something so weird about,
uh,

1344
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:23,880
uh,
civil as an animal,

1345
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:27,570
a life form,
a species that has developed for

1346
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,560
whatever hundreds of thousands of years
we've been people eating meat.

1347
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,810
I mean,
that's essentially when you look at

1348
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:35,910
scientists,
when they discover the,

1349
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,370
the,
the difference in the size of the lower

1350
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:41,580
hominids brains and humans' brains and
they're trying to figure out what the

1351
01:03:41,581 --> 01:03:45,780
fuck went wrong or right.
Rather where we developed this gigantic

1352
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:47,820
brain or wrong or wrong.
Yeah.

1353
01:03:47,821 --> 01:03:49,080
I mean,
it could be wrong.

1354
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,660
You know,
we got to get back to the garden,

1355
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,530
right?
Um,

1356
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,680
if it,
if it was what they think it is,

1357
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:57,780
it's because we started eating meat.
We started hunting.

1358
01:03:57,781 --> 01:04:00,960
We had to develop ways to be more clever
and capture.

1359
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,590
These animals were soft and spongy and
were very weak animals.

1360
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,170
So we had to get smart.
And compared to the saber tooth,

1361
01:04:07,171 --> 01:04:08,820
tigers were really,
we're crunchy.

1362
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,080
Yeah.
A ridiculous,

1363
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:13,860
we cannot run anything.
I watched a video pull this video up

1364
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:17,880
that I tweeted yesterday cause if any,
anybody wants to know how hard it is out

1365
01:04:17,881 --> 01:04:20,280
there,
there's a video of a Martin,

1366
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,630
which is a,
uh,

1367
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:24,780
uh,
an animal that a lot of people associate

1368
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:25,614
with,
uh,

1369
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,510
for trading.
And people go,

1370
01:04:27,511 --> 01:04:30,630
oh,
how could you kill a Martin Weasel

1371
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:33,570
family big weasel and it's chasing a
rabbit.

1372
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,750
And I don't know why.
I never thought of them as carnivores.

1373
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:38,820
I probably should have thought of as
carnivores.

1374
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,750
There's a fucking Martin chasing a
rabbit and it chases this thing for

1375
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,210
hundreds of yards.
And this is a spread.

1376
01:04:45,211 --> 01:04:46,350
Look at this.
Look up at the screen.

1377
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:47,460
I guess you do it right over here.

1378
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,410
You look to your right.
You don't have to look behind you.

1379
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:53,070
I think this thing,
so this Martin is chasing after this

1380
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:54,550
rather unusual terrain.
Yeah,

1381
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:59,250
well it's open road,
open road and ice and it's a dead heat

1382
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:04,430
for awhile.
But the Martin is just slowly relentless

1383
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:08,430
are closing in on this rabbit.
I don't know where these people are,

1384
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:09,990
but they were speaking a different
language.

1385
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,440
Um,
and the rabbits trying to zig and trying

1386
01:05:13,441 --> 01:05:17,770
to zag.
But the Martin is just one step after

1387
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:19,810
one step,
just an inch closer,

1388
01:05:19,811 --> 01:05:23,530
a little closer,
a little closer and there fucking

1389
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,230
hustling.
And this rabbit is like shit,

1390
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:27,340
Bam.
And then he gets them.

1391
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,550
But look,
look at this fucking evil little animal.

1392
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:34,360
It is the size of the rabbit,
which is what's really crazy.

1393
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,570
It might actually be smaller than the
round,

1394
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,870
smaller,
probably lighter.

1395
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:41,110
And he just,
we had jack that he had essentially the

1396
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:44,230
same thing happened in front of our
front porch a year or two ago.

1397
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,990
We were,
I think were on the porch or out in the

1398
01:05:46,991 --> 01:05:49,990
yard.
And suddenly we hear this squealing as

1399
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:51,780
horrible Shriek and there's,
uh,

1400
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:54,100
a young snowshoe hare,
you know,

1401
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:58,540
little little rabbit and a tiny weasel,
like an urban,

1402
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:01,000
I mean things like as big around as a
hot dog.

1403
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:02,470
I mean,
it's tiny little thing.

1404
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,510
Much small rabbit killed that rabbit.
They're intense.

1405
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,290
They're amazing right there,
right.

1406
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:10,124
That was,
I mean,

1407
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:13,630
and I'm a hunter,
but it was host still horrifying to see.

1408
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,800
And it's totally,
I mean,

1409
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:16,630
it happens all the time.
Yeah.

1410
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,790
Plants getting eaten,
animals,

1411
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:21,100
eating animals,
insects,

1412
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,090
birds.
I mean,

1413
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,680
everything's eating everything all the
time.

1414
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,840
Everything.
We don't see it most of the time.

1415
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:27,400
Most of us,
unless we are out,

1416
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,370
you know,
out in the outdoors a lot or paying

1417
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:34,690
attention to the garden and you don't
see it happening all the time in Alaska.

1418
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:39,720
And a brown bear killed a moose in his
driveway and they had to shoot the bear.

1419
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,980
The people that,
you know,

1420
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:45,820
whoever the wildlife management people
tried to shoot the bear because of

1421
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:48,830
decided to bury this fucking moose in
his garage and he keep coming into his

1422
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,750
driveway.
Yeah.

1423
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:50,584
Or in his,
um,

1424
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,120
his lawn,
like the,

1425
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:55,720
like this is his territory now coming
back for that and there's a 600 pound

1426
01:06:55,721 --> 01:07:00,610
fucking bear who just killed a moose in
his driveway and that's not even a big

1427
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:02,260
bear,
which is really terrifying.

1428
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,960
They embarrassed for brown bears.
Yeah.

1429
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,500
Yeah.
There's so big.

1430
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:09,430
And to think that the,
and he loves it there and to think that

1431
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:13,570
he's watching out his window like a
little piece of glass will thin piece of

1432
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,220
glass,
the family's luck.

1433
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,750
Oh my God,
look,

1434
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,180
oh no.
There's a video of the same thing

1435
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:21,790
happening of a,
of one habit.

1436
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:25,810
There's a video of a bear killing a
moose in this family's driveway where

1437
01:07:25,811 --> 01:07:28,700
they're looking out the window.
It happens all the time because you know

1438
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:31,420
these people that live in these parts of
the world,

1439
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:35,560
especially Alaska,
it's so like you've got like anchorage

1440
01:07:35,561 --> 01:07:38,680
and then you've got wilderness.
You know when I was up in Anchorage,

1441
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:40,150
we would just drive a little bit of,
Oh,

1442
01:07:40,151 --> 01:07:42,070
here's one right here.
Here's another one.

1443
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:47,620
It's like fucking comment up there.
This is a bear that's dragging this

1444
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:49,360
moose and this Mousse is,
I've seen this one.

1445
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:50,740
This moose is dead,
right,

1446
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:52,660
or is it still alive?
It looks dead.

1447
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,010
This one's dead.
There's some where the,

1448
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:57,130
there's another video.
We don't need to see.

1449
01:07:57,131 --> 01:08:01,090
A lot of these videos is enough,
but there's one where it's still alive

1450
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,420
and it's killing it in,
in the driving things,

1451
01:08:03,421 --> 01:08:07,270
screaming and trying to get back up and
the bear drags it away and,

1452
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,880
and alls it and yeah,
I mean it's,

1453
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:10,980
it's tough for us,
you know,

1454
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,120
as humans because we have this,
you know,

1455
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,390
we have this moral conscience that
presumably the bear doesn't have right

1456
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:20,960
about the suffering of another animal of
its prey.

1457
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,690
You know,
and we do as hunters,

1458
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,460
as farmers,
you know,

1459
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:26,990
as,
as pet owners,

1460
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:28,340
you know,
they have companion animals.

1461
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:33,341
We have this moral compass of some kind.
What we're conscious entities are aware

1462
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:36,880
of ourselves.
We have compassion and,

1463
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:42,110
and a moral code built around these,
these sorts of impulses to protect

1464
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:48,430
animals from suffering as anything.
And yet we see what happens in nature on

1465
01:08:49,491 --> 01:08:50,990
occasion.
At least we get to witness something

1466
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:53,540
like that and we have to integrate,
you know,

1467
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:57,080
what's real in nature,
the way animals do things.

1468
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:58,580
You know,
our,

1469
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:04,720
our moral frameworks aren't terribly
relevant in that world,

1470
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:09,590
but we still evaluate them like say it's
evil in what I mean,

1471
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,930
even if you don't literally mean the
Martins evil.

1472
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:12,980
But we,
we have,

1473
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:14,840
we think in those moral terms about
animals.

1474
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:15,883
Yeah,
we do.

1475
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,170
Well,
I think this is the real argument that

1476
01:09:18,171 --> 01:09:22,310
vegans have that we're trying to move
away from any suffering and this is what

1477
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:26,030
they're trying to do by trying to take a
cruelty free path,

1478
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,460
by trying,
trying to choose what they think is the

1479
01:09:28,461 --> 01:09:29,810
most ethical lifestyle.

1480
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:35,290
What they're doing is they're sort of
answering this call of evolving this,

1481
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,620
uh,
this call that they have of the evolving

1482
01:09:39,621 --> 01:09:44,600
species right away from away from
certain kinds of practices that we

1483
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,490
historically who have abandoned,
you know,

1484
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,700
not saying slavery has been banished
worldwide,

1485
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:51,750
but we as a society said,
we're,

1486
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:55,760
we can no longer do this.
And you have to evolve socially beyond

1487
01:09:55,761 --> 01:09:57,830
that.
And the argument which has,

1488
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,620
you know,
some legitimacy to it in a sense is that

1489
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:03,950
we have to evolve beyond eating meat and
so on.

1490
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,840
Well,
that's why I think this conversation so

1491
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:08,750
fascinating is because the,
the argument does have a little bit of

1492
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:13,520
merit to it is not a black and white
issue and neither is what you would call

1493
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:15,980
quote unquote trophy hunting.
That's not a black and white issue

1494
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:20,840
either because Zimbabwe just announced
they're going to call 200 lions because

1495
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:22,340
they've outlawed lion hunting.

1496
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:25,810
So now they have a surplus of lions.
Have a problem with the Angela to

1497
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,950
getting decimated.
So like,

1498
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:30,110
all right,
we've got to fucking kill some lions.

1499
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,210
And each one of those 200 lines that
they're going to call would have brought

1500
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:39,710
them $50,000 of revenue towards
conservation that would stop poaching,

1501
01:10:39,711 --> 01:10:40,720
that would,
uh,

1502
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:43,450
keep wildlife habitat.
There.

1503
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,470
It's,
it's a really complicated,

1504
01:10:45,471 --> 01:10:50,471
and the people that are on the outside
conveniently ignorant to all these facts

1505
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,130
that are incredibly complex.
Um,

1506
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,123
they,
they're not,

1507
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,190
they're not aware of this big picture.
Like,

1508
01:10:57,191 --> 01:11:00,890
I'm not saying you should go to Lyon to
Africa and go hunt lines.

1509
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:02,390
I don't want to do it.
I'm not going to do it.

1510
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,030
I don't have any desire to kill anything
like a lion,

1511
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:10,240
but to that part of the world that
brought in a considerable amount of

1512
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:14,550
revenue and there's a balance that they
attempting to

1513
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:17,190
achieve with the predators and with the
prey.

1514
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:22,530
And that balance is kind of screwed up
now that they've taken out hunting of

1515
01:11:22,531 --> 01:11:25,980
lions,
which is hard for people to imagine,

1516
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,800
you know,
cause you'll read about Africa that some

1517
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:31,090
areas the lines are threatened.
You know,

1518
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:34,800
there's this really interesting pace
that I follow on instagram called save

1519
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:37,020
the lion.
They have all these really cool photos

1520
01:11:37,021 --> 01:11:40,750
and lions and I think lines are amazing.
I'm glad they're around.

1521
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,750
I,
I like looking at videos of them.

1522
01:11:42,751 --> 01:11:44,970
I would love to see them in real life
other than a zoo,

1523
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:47,550
you know,
but you get too many of them.

1524
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:49,980
You've got a real problem.
And the only animal that can figure that

1525
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:51,480
out as us,
it's it,

1526
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,523
there's,
you know,

1527
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:54,750
the goats aren't going to get together
and go,

1528
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:57,120
hey man,
we've got to fucking do something about

1529
01:11:57,121 --> 01:11:58,830
this mountain lion population.
We're just,

1530
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:00,000
there's no more goats.
We've gotta,

1531
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:01,730
we've gotta we've gotta help you.
No,

1532
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,361
no,
it's,

1533
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:06,150
it's only people that can count the
number of wildlife biologists that can

1534
01:12:06,151 --> 01:12:11,151
figure out what's the right amount and
people that can study the results of

1535
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:15,000
having a disproportionate population of
predators and realize that we've got to

1536
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:15,910
do something about that.

1537
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:17,211
Yeah.
I mean,

1538
01:12:17,211 --> 01:12:21,170
the Predator Predator predators are
really complicated all over the world.

1539
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:22,640
I mean,
here they're complicated in Africa,

1540
01:12:22,641 --> 01:12:23,960
the complicated in many parts of the
world,

1541
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,610
um,
ecologically in relationship to pray.

1542
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:29,620
You know,
if,

1543
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:33,320
if we had a very large area and we just
weren't part of the picture,

1544
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:39,620
it's not as though predators would just
completely wipe out the prey.

1545
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:44,990
They will run out of food as prey gets
harder to catch.

1546
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:48,130
Prase not going to disappear entirely
just because of a lion,

1547
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:49,700
you know,
group of lions or,

1548
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,790
or wolves a or any other kind of
predator.

1549
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,560
They will ebb and flow.
They have different sort of states of

1550
01:12:57,561 --> 01:13:00,200
equilibrium,
high density of both low density of both

1551
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:05,240
changes and those sorts of things happen
in relationship to us and our different

1552
01:13:05,391 --> 01:13:07,280
interests,
agriculture,

1553
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:11,330
livestock,
you know ungulates that the local human

1554
01:13:11,331 --> 01:13:12,350
population values.

1555
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,800
Then it gets really complicated.
And you know,

1556
01:13:15,801 --> 01:13:18,770
the issue you're bringing up about,
well they're calling lions and it could

1557
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:23,771
have brought in so many tens of
thousands of dollars from hunters and

1558
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,840
I've just been working on this essay
about these sorts of issues.

1559
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:32,290
There's all these practical issues about
money conservation and those sorts of

1560
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:36,770
things that are happening in Zimbabwe
for example,

1561
01:13:36,771 --> 01:13:41,390
or other countries or here.
And then there's the,

1562
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:45,770
the moral and ethical issues around
animal welfare.

1563
01:13:45,771 --> 01:13:50,771
And is it respectful of life to kill an
animal just for the head or do you have

1564
01:13:51,171 --> 01:13:53,030
to eat it?
And so there's,

1565
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:58,280
there's a language of practicality.
What does the Zimbabwe need to fund

1566
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,230
given programs,
how do you fund that?

1567
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,370
And then there's the whole discussion in
language of,

1568
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,510
of the morals and ethics of it,
which is,

1569
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,130
you know,
those are active discussions among

1570
01:14:07,131 --> 01:14:08,510
hunters too.
Yeah,

1571
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,970
they really are.
And the end they should,

1572
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,010
because again,

1573
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,470
this is not a black and white issue.
It's very complicated.

1574
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,930
You're talking about a country like
Zimbabwe,

1575
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:21,610
which is incredibly poor,
which could have benefited from $1

1576
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:26,380
million in money that would aid
conservation if they allowed these hunts

1577
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,830
to continue.
So each one of these 200 lions that were

1578
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:34,040
killed would be worth $50,000.
Know that's a,

1579
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,640
that's fascinating cause it is.
It is.

1580
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,860
Cause it's not,
it's not really that simple.

1581
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:44,160
And also Africa's enormous and this is
something that a lot of people don't

1582
01:14:44,711 --> 01:14:47,260
consider either.
When you think of Africa,

1583
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:49,150
you hear,
well lions are in danger while they're

1584
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,600
in danger in some spots.
But you know that's like saying,

1585
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,150
I looked out my yard today,
there's no deer.

1586
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:58,840
Okay well go to upstate New York.
There's a shitload of them.

1587
01:14:58,841 --> 01:15:01,040
They're everywhere to the point where
they're,

1588
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:05,470
they have to hire assassins essentially
to go in and call the deer because

1589
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:06,670
they've got so many of them.

1590
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:09,370
They've got to go in and shoot them.
I mean this is,

1591
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:13,840
this is a big problem in a lot of places
on the east coast.

1592
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:18,850
There's areas in Pennsylvania that don't
have a hunting season for deer and in

1593
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:21,250
people's neighborhoods.
You could just shoot them all the time.

1594
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:23,110
They want,
they bring an archer's.

1595
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:26,330
There's this television show,
there's archery bowhunting show where it

1596
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,460
was in the middle of the spring and uh,
they,

1597
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:34,420
they brought in these archers to set up
tree stands in these like residential

1598
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:35,800
neighborhoods.
It's crazy.

1599
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,740
Yeah.
The rebound in white tails and you know,

1600
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,570
in the country as a whole,
but particularly,

1601
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:42,970
you know,
along the eastern seaboard has created

1602
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:45,310
some bizarre,
bizarre situations,

1603
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:48,370
particularly in suburbs.
The animals that used to be symbols of

1604
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:53,360
the wild and still are from any of us
are hanging out in people's lawns.

1605
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,390
Not only that,
that giving people lyme disease,

1606
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,310
that's a big concern about that.

1607
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:00,400
That's a big concern.
Ticks that carry lyme disease.

1608
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:05,430
They say something like 60% of the ticks
in New York state have lyme disease,

1609
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,370
some insane number like that.
I just made that up.

1610
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:11,130
Check,
check,

1611
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:11,801
check,
check,

1612
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:15,220
check.
But it's some really bizarre Lee high

1613
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:20,221
number of ticks in certain areas of
upstate New York where there's a giant,

1614
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:25,740
a prevalence of deep bolt dear and um,
and lyme disease that they have a huge

1615
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:29,050
issue and they really don't know how to
stop it.

1616
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,720
Cause lyme disease is devastating if you
get it.

1617
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:34,690
It's horrible on your immune system.
It's rough.

1618
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,160
Yeah.
I can get into nervous system,

1619
01:16:36,161 --> 01:16:37,030
do all sorts of things.
Do you?

1620
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:40,540
Yeah.
And that's also a problem that happens

1621
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:44,410
when you have overpopulation of deer.
There's all chronic wasting disease,

1622
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:48,890
a bunch of different diseases that come
through overpopulation and you know,

1623
01:16:48,891 --> 01:16:51,160
and it's uh,
on the chronic wasting disease of

1624
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:51,994
course,
that,

1625
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:55,780
you know,
the risks associated with that brings up

1626
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,840
the whole sort of captive deer hunting
industry and issues when that they start

1627
01:17:02,171 --> 01:17:07,150
moving animals around,
then maybe carry cwd or other diseases

1628
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,520
and then they have contact with wild
populations

1629
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,840
and while they're doing these,
this is part of the whole trophy hunting

1630
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:18,050
thing that's so bizarre.
They're doing these fenced in

1631
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:21,830
establishments where you go and hunt and
you're hunting these animals that have

1632
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:24,050
been grown just for their enormous
antlers.

1633
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:28,070
We covered it a couple of days ago with
my friend Doug Durham and uh,

1634
01:17:28,071 --> 01:17:30,950
we showed some photos that animals that
don't look like deer,

1635
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:32,270
they're bizarre.
Yeah.

1636
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:35,900
They have like these weird sculptures on
their heads like bushes,

1637
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,180
right?
Like a Bush growing out of their head.

1638
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:38,800
Like,
yeah.

1639
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,320
It's just so much,
so much antler material.

1640
01:17:42,321 --> 01:17:43,820
It just doesn't make any sense.
Yeah.

1641
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,360
It's a huge industry.
The Indianapolis Star,

1642
01:17:47,361 --> 01:17:52,361
I think a few years ago did a really
good long form expo's a on,

1643
01:17:53,231 --> 01:17:55,160
on that whole industry.
And it is bizarre.

1644
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:57,410
Isn't that just how it's always going to
be though?

1645
01:17:57,411 --> 01:18:00,490
I mean,
if you have any sort of a,

1646
01:18:00,491 --> 01:18:03,410
a discipline and he sort of a pursuit,
you're going to have people that are

1647
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:04,220
unethical.

1648
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,960
You're going to have people that are,
uh,

1649
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:09,010
you know,
race car drivers that are using just

1650
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:13,160
stronger engines and they're supposed to
use or cheating somehow or another on

1651
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:14,990
this or on that.
Or it's just,

1652
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,870
it's how it is all across the board in
life.

1653
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,550
Sure.
And that people who want to do that,

1654
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,990
whether it's legal or not,
and how much industry is allowed to be

1655
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,190
built up around it.
Right.

1656
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:29,810
So you have like the hunting industry or
the hunting community,

1657
01:18:29,811 --> 01:18:31,940
the hunting world,
you're going to have people like

1658
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:36,740
yourself that are doing it to provide
their family with sustainable meat.

1659
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:41,950
And then you're going to have a guy who
wants a collection of different animals

1660
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:45,080
from all of the world's stuffed in his
room so he could show everybody,

1661
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:45,861
you know,
like,

1662
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:48,410
this is my zebra room.
You know,

1663
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:49,640
like you ever seen those fucking guys.

1664
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:51,720
It's,
it's terrains,

1665
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,080
man.
I was watching the television show once

1666
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:58,040
and this guy brought these people into
this room that looked like a high school

1667
01:18:58,041 --> 01:19:03,041
auditorium and he was just like the
super wealthy guy who hunts all over the

1668
01:19:03,771 --> 01:19:04,820
world.
That's all he does.

1669
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:09,410
And it was just like a stuffed zoo.
It was the strangest thing.

1670
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:13,280
Birds and fucking baboons and all these
stuff things.

1671
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,110
I'm like,
this is the weirdest guy.

1672
01:19:15,111 --> 01:19:17,810
This guy's like a serial killer of
animals,

1673
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,100
like some weird thing that he's attached
himself to.

1674
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,260
Yeah.
One of the things that's tricky is

1675
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:28,430
because
such a relatively small percentage of

1676
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:31,040
the population here in the states hunts,
you know,

1677
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:32,720
it's,
how small is it?

1678
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:33,823
You know,
it,

1679
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:36,620
it varies depending on how it's millions
of people,

1680
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,000
millions of people.
It is.

1681
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:39,051
Um,
but you know,

1682
01:19:39,051 --> 01:19:44,051
it's on the order of 10% will ever take
what percentage of Vegan fewer than

1683
01:19:46,101 --> 01:19:47,630
that.
But again,

1684
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:48,860
it's a small number,
right?

1685
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,850
In La,
I bet it's higher vegans to hunters.

1686
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,930
I bet the hunters are way out numbered
and this fucking Koofie city.

1687
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:58,270
It could be,
I would imagine.

1688
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,080
Uh,
but because,

1689
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:03,590
because it's this true for Vegetarians
and vegans too,

1690
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:08,790
because we're a minority population,
it's really easy for

1691
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:14,250
most people to have sort of a stereotype
view and to lump them all together.

1692
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:18,270
You know,
and the analogy I sometimes draw is,

1693
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,660
you know,
because such a huge percentage of the

1694
01:20:21,661 --> 01:20:26,661
population drives cars,
we can distinguish between good drivers

1695
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:30,300
and bad drivers.
People who get into road rage and people

1696
01:20:30,301 --> 01:20:32,880
who were polite.
We can distinguish these things and we

1697
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:36,690
have understandings of it because we
experience it and we see it and we don't

1698
01:20:36,691 --> 01:20:39,280
judge people for being drivers or lump
them all together.

1699
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,080
Right.
You know,

1700
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,500
but any minority community runs the
risk.

1701
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:45,270
This is true for Vegetarians to,
for hunters.

1702
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:50,010
True for any minority community.
We run the risk of being identified as a

1703
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:53,640
sort of a monolithic singular group.
So you get,

1704
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:59,060
you know,
a hunter who portrays a certain image of

1705
01:20:59,361 --> 01:21:00,980
hunting and if fact,
oh,

1706
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,360
that's what hunting is.
Boom.

1707
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:04,190
Yeah.
You know,

1708
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:06,960
this,
this identity gets attached to all

1709
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:07,794
hunters.
And not,

1710
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,990
I'm not saying it always happens,
but there's a risk of that.

1711
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:14,070
Um,
and I think the part of the gift of this

1712
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:16,380
time,
particularly in relation to the food

1713
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:16,981
movement,
you know,

1714
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:21,090
Michael Pollan's work and is that people
are asking questions,

1715
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:23,130
people are thinking about agriculture
fuel,

1716
01:21:23,131 --> 01:21:25,140
thinking about wild foods.
People are thinking about their

1717
01:21:25,141 --> 01:21:27,720
relationships ecologically and ethically
with what they eat.

1718
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,950
Yeah.
And I think that's great.

1719
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:32,200
I think,
uh,

1720
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:36,230
I think it's a good thing.
I think these weird sort of,

1721
01:21:36,231 --> 01:21:38,330
um,
stereotypes that we have about,

1722
01:21:38,331 --> 01:21:40,790
about hunters,
they're really easy to do in this day

1723
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:41,870
and age.
It's really,

1724
01:21:41,871 --> 01:21:42,950
it's,
they're attractive.

1725
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:45,290
You know,
from the time Bambi was released,

1726
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,960
it's attractive to lump hunters into
this evil.

1727
01:21:47,961 --> 01:21:51,470
Like if you see hunters in a movie,
they're almost always these cruel

1728
01:21:51,471 --> 01:21:52,304
assholes.
Like,

1729
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:54,990
did you ever see the movie wolverine?
No.

1730
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:58,610
Rain got mad because there was a bunch
of hunters and they poisoned a bear and

1731
01:21:58,611 --> 01:22:01,650
he beats him up at a bar.
They're all mean people like that

1732
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:02,503
anymore.
A wolverine.

1733
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:03,530
What do you eat?
And Dude,

1734
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:04,720
look at the size of you.
Fuck,

1735
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:05,901
you know,
what do you eat?

1736
01:22:05,901 --> 01:22:08,410
And Hugh Jackman and ain't lentils.
You know,

1737
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:10,920
you're eating a lot of meat.
I bet it's,

1738
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:12,590
it's a strange,
you know,

1739
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:16,940
it's this strange thing that we have
decided because we're conveniently

1740
01:22:16,941 --> 01:22:20,300
removed from the process of killing the
animal,

1741
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:22,210
seeing the animal alive,
see,

1742
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:23,450
killing it,
butchering it,

1743
01:22:23,451 --> 01:22:24,980
chopping it up,
and then cooking it.

1744
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:29,720
We just get to the gimme a piece or even
more disconnected.

1745
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:32,570
We'd go to a restaurant,
so disconnected.

1746
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:36,170
It's like we're 18 steps removed.
Sure.

1747
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,260
It's,
it's real convenient to look at hunters

1748
01:22:39,261 --> 01:22:41,000
like some horrible evil thing.
You know,

1749
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,070
like I said,
one of the,

1750
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:45,740
my favorite is the people that eat meat
and say,

1751
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:49,100
you don't have to do that because you
can just go to the supermarket.

1752
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,350
Why would you want to do it?
You only do it because you're cruel,

1753
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,500
but they can't imagine that you would do
it because you want to kind of

1754
01:22:54,501 --> 01:22:56,420
understand what are the consequences of
what you're doing.

1755
01:22:56,421 --> 01:22:57,970
Is this what you want to do?
You know?

1756
01:22:58,640 --> 01:22:59,473
I mean,
I think

1757
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,830
you're right about the,
the movies,

1758
01:23:03,370 --> 01:23:04,203
excuse me.
Um,

1759
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:07,730
from Bambi having that kind of,
um,

1760
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:11,500
cultural impact and portrayal of hunters
as,

1761
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,780
you know,
a force of evil and being sort of anti

1762
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:14,890
nature,
right.

1763
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:15,783
You know,
the,

1764
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,280
the sort of disruptors of,
of this

1765
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:23,020
eden like natural world.
Um,

1766
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:28,350
and
I think that a lot of times hunting

1767
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:33,630
industry and hunters today and the media
around hunting,

1768
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:39,760
forget how the rest of the world
perceives like the,

1769
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,390
the trophy photo.
Even if it's an animal you're going to

1770
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,800
eat,
you're smiling with the picture.

1771
01:23:44,801 --> 01:23:45,634
Oh,
you know,

1772
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:50,700
as like what is seen in that from
someone who's not experienced that and

1773
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:55,740
doesn't know.
Is that a image of respect for the

1774
01:23:56,141 --> 01:23:57,910
animal?
What is the,

1775
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,270
if,
if a hunter is expressing joy in that

1776
01:24:01,271 --> 01:24:02,680
picture,
is it joy?

1777
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,840
Is that joy at the death?
Well,

1778
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:05,770
what's going on?

1779
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:08,770
You know,
and those sorts of images in,

1780
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:13,940
you know,
tv shows and just photos posted online.

1781
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,230
I think it's hard for,
and,

1782
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:17,860
and it's almost even hard for me,
you know,

1783
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:19,210
but I think it's hard for a lot of 900.
It's like,

1784
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:21,190
what?
What does that mean?

1785
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,890
It's a,
it's kind of disturbing.

1786
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:25,330
Well,
yeah.

1787
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:29,950
Is it that you're happy that you
accomplished this very difficult thing

1788
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:33,310
or is it that you're proud of yourself,
that you're a killer,

1789
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:35,050
right.
Or you know,

1790
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:39,250
are you a,
are you posing with this thing because

1791
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:41,980
it's your trophy and you win,
you know,

1792
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:44,390
are you cruel?
Are you happy because you're happy,

1793
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,900
you're smiling because that's what you
do for cameras,

1794
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:50,290
you know?
And I've never been terribly comfort.

1795
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:54,970
I've taken photos like when I've hunted
and succeeded in and the first time I

1796
01:24:54,971 --> 01:24:56,370
did it I,
you know,

1797
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,440
took a photo of,
cause I want it to be able to send it to

1798
01:24:59,441 --> 01:25:00,050
my uncle.

1799
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:02,410
Right.
But I wasn't smiling.

1800
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,990
I just,
for me it was like I had to have to

1801
01:25:04,991 --> 01:25:07,000
force a smile.
I'm actually not,

1802
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:11,260
I don't experience the same sort of rush
that some people do in it.

1803
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,200
Um,
I find hunting meaningful and I find

1804
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:17,290
that moment incredibly powerful.
Um,

1805
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:22,890
but it's never been only until just this
past fall I finally took a photo that I

1806
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:28,450
actually felt
I read that I really felt good about,

1807
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:29,810
you know,
and I would,

1808
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:32,800
what were you doing the photo?
It's actually on my facebook page.

1809
01:25:32,801 --> 01:25:34,870
I think my books facebook page,
it's,

1810
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:39,670
the deer was down and I was just
kneeling there and have my hands on the

1811
01:25:39,671 --> 01:25:41,650
deer and I was just,
you know,

1812
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:46,420
just being in that moment with that
animal,

1813
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:49,390
it wasn't about,
you know,

1814
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:51,250
the camera,
it wasn't about smiling,

1815
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:53,050
it wasn't about this is what I
accomplished.

1816
01:25:53,051 --> 01:25:55,810
It was just,
this is an important,

1817
01:25:55,811 --> 01:25:56,830
there it is right there.
Yeah,

1818
01:25:57,090 --> 01:25:57,923
that's,
that's,

1819
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:03,420
that's like the first time I've taken a
photo after a hunt that really felt good

1820
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:04,070
to

1821
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,510
me.
You know,

1822
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:07,280
that's a great picture.
You know,

1823
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,920
that's a great picture because boy that
is the wild.

1824
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:12,770
I mean,
you are in the woods and that's less

1825
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,240
than a half a mile from home.
That's awesome.

1826
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:17,720
Great Place.
And you're there with a really wild

1827
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:22,010
deer,
a nice big mature whitetail that was

1828
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:25,250
probably at the end of his voyage and
took them out.

1829
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:30,230
Um,
I've posed with pictures of animals that

1830
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:34,520
I shot and I've done it smiling because
I'm happy because it's difficult to do.

1831
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,910
It doesn't take away from the reverence
that I have for the animal,

1832
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:39,161
you know?
Uh,

1833
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:40,880
especially elk.
Elk are,

1834
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:43,640
in my opinion,
they're like almost like a mythical

1835
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:45,170
creature.
I'm very,

1836
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,440
very happy when I,
when I've killed an elk,

1837
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:52,520
especially the one that I killed with a
bow because it's so hard to do.

1838
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,580
It's insanely difficult.
There's the same amount of pressure and

1839
01:26:55,581 --> 01:26:58,220
when it's over,
when you've accomplished it.

1840
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,910
Like if I,
if I get ready for a rifle hunt,

1841
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,950
I cite my rifle in,
um,

1842
01:27:03,951 --> 01:27:06,830
I go to the range,
I squeeze off a few rounds,

1843
01:27:06,831 --> 01:27:09,740
I make sure my form is good,
I make sure my trigger discipline is

1844
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:12,200
good and I'm ready to rock.
I'm good to go.

1845
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:16,940
If I am thinking about hunting in
September,

1846
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:22,570
I will start preparing in October for
the following September.

1847
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,610
I'm not bull around.
Yeah.

1848
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:30,880
Cause once I started hunting with a bow,
I realized like this is insanely

1849
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:33,890
difficult.
This is not something you can kind of

1850
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:36,920
dabble in.
And I know some people do and I don't

1851
01:27:36,921 --> 01:27:38,690
know how the hell they do it.
Um,

1852
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:41,360
maybe they just don't,
maybe they're not,

1853
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:44,540
they're not worried about the
consequences as much as I am.

1854
01:27:44,541 --> 01:27:47,420
Or maybe maybe,
I dunno.

1855
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:49,940
Maybe they're just better at it than me.
I don't think so though.

1856
01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:52,820
I just think,
I think archery is something that you

1857
01:27:52,821 --> 01:27:56,660
have to do all the time.
I don't think you could take 10 months

1858
01:27:56,661 --> 01:28:00,290
off of archery practice for a couple
weeks and be as proficient as if you

1859
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:04,460
were practicing those entire 10 months.
Most of the people that I know,

1860
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:05,510
there's meet with,
uh,

1861
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:08,960
an elk that I shot.
I'm happy right there.

1862
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,240
People got mad at me for that picture.
But it's,

1863
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:15,050
it's hard I think for people who,
you know,

1864
01:28:15,051 --> 01:28:17,150
you've experienced that you were there,
you know what you felt,

1865
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:19,310
you know what your reverence was for
that animal.

1866
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:21,650
You know what you were happy about you,
you know,

1867
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:25,190
I'm happy it died quick to write you.
You know what all the things that went

1868
01:28:25,191 --> 01:28:26,170
on there.
Yes.

1869
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:30,530
As a snapshot to someone who's never
experienced anything like that,

1870
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,980
it doesn't,
they don't know any that you look like a

1871
01:28:34,981 --> 01:28:37,790
a mean person who's happy that you've
just killed.

1872
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:38,810
Exactly.
That's,

1873
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:39,980
yeah,
exactly.

1874
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:43,790
There's so much going on when it,
when it comes to a photo with that

1875
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:45,470
animal,
because it's not just about,

1876
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,600
look,
if I took that photo just for me,

1877
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:51,080
that's perfect.
If that's just my photo and I keep it on

1878
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:52,550
my phone and I,
and I go,

1879
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:55,700
I want to look at it every now and then.
This is the moment where I shot that elk

1880
01:28:55,701 --> 01:28:58,820
and I was really happy that I was able
to make a clean shot.

1881
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,290
The animal died in seconds.
Everything went great.

1882
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,690
All my training paid off,
all the hard work,

1883
01:29:03,691 --> 01:29:05,550
all the thinking,
all the preparation,

1884
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:08,070
all the paid off.
But that's not just for me,

1885
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:09,580
that's for everybody else too.
Right.

1886
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:13,700
But that's also why it has a really long
paragraph attached to it where I went

1887
01:29:13,701 --> 01:29:15,330
into,
usually there's not that context.

1888
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:16,560
Yeah.
Well for me,

1889
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:17,790
I think it's very important.

1890
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,650
It's a,
it was very important.

1891
01:29:19,651 --> 01:29:23,880
It was important to thank my friend
Cameron hanes because without his help

1892
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:25,350
and without his teaching,
me,

1893
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:27,150
I,
it would have taken a lot longer to

1894
01:29:27,151 --> 01:29:31,080
learn how to get good with a bow and to
understand,

1895
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,570
uh,
how did,

1896
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:35,970
what a difficult pursuit it is.
And just to keep your nerves together.

1897
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:40,971
When this thousand pound tree full
forest horse is coming up the hill

1898
01:29:41,341 --> 01:29:44,760
screaming at you and you have to shoot
that thing with a bow and Arrow,

1899
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,830
you know,
there's a lot going on there man.

1900
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:49,140
And there's consequences is,
I think,

1901
01:29:49,141 --> 01:29:52,140
decides to kick your ass.
There's not a whole lot you could do,

1902
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,070
you know,
that's know.

1903
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,500
Have you ever hunted elk?

1904
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,570
Whenever I was,
I was out in New Mexico this fall for,

1905
01:29:58,571 --> 01:30:01,780
I had a writing residency down there for
a month and I had a,

1906
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:04,660
a mule deer tag for a few days at the
end of that,

1907
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:06,550
um,
I did not end up shooting,

1908
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,410
uh,
didn't shoot it all when I was down

1909
01:30:08,411 --> 01:30:09,970
there at an animal.
Um,

1910
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,460
saw a few deer,
um,

1911
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,740
and,
but saw a few elk close.

1912
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,900
I wasn't hunting them,
but they came through.

1913
01:30:16,901 --> 01:30:18,340
We,
we heard him comment links like,

1914
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:21,700
wow,
that's almost like a moose up where I

1915
01:30:21,701 --> 01:30:22,930
am.
That's a big animal.

1916
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:23,830
They're pretty close,

1917
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,310
pretty close to the size of a moose
there.

1918
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,960
Awesome man.
They're amazing.

1919
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:30,030
They're so cool.
There's

1920
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:33,210
her and I heard at least one beautiful,
which was wild.

1921
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,040
I'd never heard it might hurt,
you know,

1922
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:37,240
I heard a tape of it,
but I never actually heard one view.

1923
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,790
What,
what time of the year was it when you

1924
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:40,320
were there?
I was there in October

1925
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,290
when I go.
Um,

1926
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:47,260
I'm going to go hunting again in
September and I'm going to bring my kids

1927
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,110
and on one day,
um,

1928
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:53,620
I'm hoping that I could be successful
and have a day just to take them out and

1929
01:30:53,621 --> 01:30:55,780
bugle for them and just make some cow
calls.

1930
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:59,650
Just they can hear the screams.
Cause it is amazing,

1931
01:30:59,651 --> 01:31:03,830
man.
I eat for someone who's never been like

1932
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:08,850
in a canyon while they're all around you
screaming as the morning light is

1933
01:31:09,101 --> 01:31:10,450
coming,
coming up.

1934
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,480
It's,
it's one of the weirdest things and all

1935
01:31:13,481 --> 01:31:17,440
of nature and the fact that this is
going on in the American wilderness and

1936
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:22,330
the vast majority of people that live in
this country will never experienced that

1937
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:25,600
outside of hunting.
Just take the hunting out of it and

1938
01:31:25,601 --> 01:31:26,830
just,
just be there.

1939
01:31:26,831 --> 01:31:31,831
And here
it's this huge barrel chested thousand

1940
01:31:32,311 --> 01:31:36,270
pound animal screaming at the top of his
lungs.

1941
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,140
There's really nothing like them.
Yeah.

1942
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:44,300
And you know,
the fact that we have these populations

1943
01:31:44,301 --> 01:31:46,160
of these animals,
these amazing,

1944
01:31:46,190 --> 01:31:48,320
amazing animals and the,
and the places,

1945
01:31:48,321 --> 01:31:50,300
you know,
it's a big debate that I know Steve and

1946
01:31:50,301 --> 01:31:53,540
Mel has been involved in the politics of
public lands.

1947
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:55,610
You know,
there are a lot of people who want to

1948
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,020
turn,
you know,

1949
01:31:57,021 --> 01:32:00,070
federal lands over to the state and
privatized

1950
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,390
a lot of that.
So a lot of that off.

1951
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:04,480
And that's a big issue with a lot of
Republican politicians.

1952
01:32:04,481 --> 01:32:08,140
It's one of the reasons why Rinella
considers himself a political unit.

1953
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:09,880
He's like,
the Democrats wanted to take your guns

1954
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:11,770
away and the Republicans want to take
your land.

1955
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,870
And it's a,
it's real interesting.

1956
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:16,930
This land that we have in this country
was established,

1957
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,880
this,
these wild lands.

1958
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:23,050
He's public lands by Theodore Roosevelt.
And he established it because he was a

1959
01:32:23,051 --> 01:32:24,950
hunter and a conservationist and he
realized like,

1960
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:27,360
you've got to lock this stuff down.
So I need,

1961
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:29,650
you know,
John,

1962
01:32:29,651 --> 01:32:33,490
we are founding a Sierra club who yes,
who had a lot in common with Roosevelt,

1963
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,940
disagree to them about hunting.
But equally important,

1964
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:39,280
you know,
equally committed to preserve,

1965
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:41,620
you know,
you have Samedi preserve these places.

1966
01:32:41,621 --> 01:32:42,850
We need,
you know,

1967
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:45,910
not everything has to be helped like,
but we need public land and even

1968
01:32:45,911 --> 01:32:47,230
Yosemite's an issue,
man,

1969
01:32:47,231 --> 01:32:49,240
they're,
they're calling buffalo now.

1970
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:50,710
They're,
they're shooting bison,

1971
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,510
Yosemite or yellowstone.
Yellowstone.

1972
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:54,820
Sorry.
I always fuck those two of those wise,

1973
01:32:54,821 --> 01:32:58,060
you know,
it's just a yet at y I guess.

1974
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:59,320
Um,
but uh,

1975
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:02,020
yellowstone with the bisons they're
having a real issue.

1976
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:03,340
You know,
they have to,

1977
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:06,180
they have to call them now and people
that are,

1978
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:09,790
that want to be able to hunt yellowstone
or kind of angry about the whole thing,

1979
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:11,500
they're eventually going to have to
call.

1980
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:13,930
Some of the grizzlies are saying,
cause the grizzlies are getting too

1981
01:33:13,931 --> 01:33:17,250
crazy and they're getting too
comfortable with people you have,

1982
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:22,280
they have real issues even in Yosemite I
think with bears not,

1983
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:26,390
you know,
getting in people's cars and yeah,

1984
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:28,480
we'll put you open your car.
Like,

1985
01:33:28,481 --> 01:33:30,350
I can't open a ticket a apart.
Yeah,

1986
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,900
I smell food.
You're good night.

1987
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:34,060
I know.
Even a smaller blackberry,

1988
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:36,160
he just can't believe how strong those
things are.

1989
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:36,940
Amazing.
We,

1990
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:38,350
because we live in the woods,
I mean,

1991
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:43,980
we have them come investigate our house.
Sometimes you'll see the prints or I've

1992
01:33:44,531 --> 01:33:47,740
seen him on the back porch,
you know,

1993
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:49,720
through the screen.
Right.

1994
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:50,890
It's like,
hi.

1995
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,450
I mean,
and they're pretty skittish.

1996
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:52,800
I mean,
like,

1997
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,370
we are there,
you know,

1998
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,470
they do not hang around people.
Um,

1999
01:33:56,710 --> 01:33:58,660
and so I have to do is make noise and
they take off.

2000
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:01,240
They're not really dangerous to people
at all,

2001
01:34:01,241 --> 01:34:02,710
but it's pretty neat to be that close to
them.

2002
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,180
And you see even a small one,
you're like,

2003
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:06,180
oh,
that's a pretty good sized,

2004
01:34:06,181 --> 01:34:08,350
powerful Animal Rinella.
His friend,

2005
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:10,960
um,
took this young guy,

2006
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,041
uh,
like,

2007
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:15,250
uh,
I dunno if it's one of his relatives or

2008
01:34:15,251 --> 01:34:18,880
whatever.
Took him on a black bear hunt a while

2009
01:34:18,881 --> 01:34:20,870
they're sleeping.
It took them on some kind of haunts.

2010
01:34:20,871 --> 01:34:22,090
I don't even know if it was a black bear
hunt,

2011
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:27,340
but while they were sleeping was
attacked by 500 pound black bear in his

2012
01:34:27,341 --> 01:34:28,730
tent.
Um,

2013
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:32,500
big melee and sue's,
everybody's screaming.

2014
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:37,930
One of his friends shoots the bear and
hits this kid.

2015
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:42,490
Then his first hunt ever in the elbow
shatters his elbow with the gun.

2016
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:43,600
Yeah.
The,

2017
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,940
the whole thing is chaos.
They wind up killing the bear.

2018
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:51,210
Seven foot tall,
500 pound black bear that had come to

2019
01:34:51,281 --> 01:34:54,460
kill this kid.
Malden cut them up pretty bad.

2020
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:56,830
But yeah,
bears are,

2021
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,670
there are crazy

2022
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:02,660
thing that if they weren't real,
I mean if a grizzly bear wasn't a real

2023
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:04,580
creature and you saw it in a movie and
be like,

2024
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:07,430
what?
Like it's a star wars it animal and a

2025
01:35:07,431 --> 01:35:09,950
lot of ways very powerful.
Yeah.

2026
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:13,220
And you know,
it's amazing to think about,

2027
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:16,790
you know,
traditional subsistence hunting cultures

2028
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:21,791
that hunted bears of that scale went
into their den sometimes that's pretty

2029
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,480
hard core.
Oh,

2030
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,000
it's so crazy.
You know,

2031
01:35:26,001 --> 01:35:27,830
you have to do what you have to do to
stay alive.

2032
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:30,620
And that's what again,
we can't appreciate that.

2033
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:33,620
Yeah,
we are in some strange state now.

2034
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:38,621
We're our meat.
We associate meet with a thin plastic

2035
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:41,960
wrap over a styrofoam tray.
Right,

2036
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:42,943
right.
That's me.

2037
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:44,780
You know,
going back to the idea of,

2038
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:47,150
you know,
animal people and spirituality,

2039
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:49,640
I'm thinking about these sort of
traditional hunting cultures too.

2040
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:56,050
There's this great film documentary
called Diet of souls that was done by

2041
01:35:56,871 --> 01:35:57,860
this guy,
uh,

2042
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:01,760
up in the north up in like Alaska.

2043
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:07,120
And one of the basic questions in the
film is how can an animal be your

2044
01:36:10,521 --> 01:36:13,610
spiritual equal,
which is how it's thought of in many

2045
01:36:13,611 --> 01:36:14,670
traditional,
you know,

2046
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:18,350
hunting cultures there you're equals,
they aren't just animals.

2047
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:20,120
You,
they're powerful.

2048
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:23,420
And,
and yet they're also your daily bread

2049
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:26,780
there also what you eat every day and
how does that get integrated in these

2050
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,100
traditions?
And it's,

2051
01:36:28,101 --> 01:36:30,710
it's,
it's pretty fascinating cause we don't

2052
01:36:30,711 --> 01:36:31,490
think,
you know,

2053
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:35,840
as a sort of Western civilization,
we've developed these [inaudible],

2054
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:38,720
the lower animals and the higher
primates,

2055
01:36:38,721 --> 01:36:39,700
as you know.
Yeah,

2056
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,640
right.
We have these,

2057
01:36:40,641 --> 01:36:44,780
this sort of hierarchy and we'll eat the
lower ones or the ugly ones we talked

2058
01:36:44,781 --> 01:36:48,340
about,
but the ones that are equal to us or

2059
01:36:48,341 --> 01:36:50,480
higher or better,
or maybe there's nothing higher,

2060
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:54,190
better than us in Western civilization
and I in our imagination Unicorns,

2061
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:55,160
right?
Unicorn,

2062
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:56,743
Rainbow Unicorn.

2063
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:02,390
Um,
so we've had this convenient way of,

2064
01:37:02,391 --> 01:37:04,260
of creating this hierarchy and,
and,

2065
01:37:04,261 --> 01:37:07,700
and thinking of ourselves sort of being
at the top of this pyramid in some way.

2066
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:11,330
Um,
but in cultures that see themselves

2067
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:16,331
still is very much part of a more of a
circle of peers,

2068
01:37:16,761 --> 01:37:18,710
you know,
in the community and yet also are eating

2069
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:22,850
these animal people all the time is a
different world view.

2070
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:24,800
Well,
vegans will say,

2071
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:26,450
well,
why don't you start eating people then

2072
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:29,090
if you want to be all spiritually
connected to your food.

2073
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:30,680
Right?
How about hey friends,

2074
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:34,250
I respect you.
I'm an eater now you're going to feed my

2075
01:37:34,251 --> 01:37:35,640
whole neighborhood,
right?

2076
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:37,100
Yeah.
Well,

2077
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:39,200
you know,
there's,

2078
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:43,550
there's something that we appreciate
about these native American cultures

2079
01:37:43,551 --> 01:37:46,400
that had a deep reverence for the
animals that they change and European

2080
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:49,210
cultures for that matter.
Know what ancient European,

2081
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,091
well,
I mean pre,

2082
01:37:50,091 --> 01:37:52,910
you know,
before agriculture,

2083
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,070
before um,
Christianity,

2084
01:37:56,071 --> 01:37:58,530
you know,
we have traditions and all of us,

2085
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:00,120
they go back,
you know,

2086
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:04,110
arguably all of us back to Africa or all
parts of the world where,

2087
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:05,730
you know,
we had,

2088
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:06,470
you know,
the,

2089
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:09,100
the caves of Lascaux in France,
you know,

2090
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:14,120
were painted by ancient European people
who had probably a somewhat similar,

2091
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:21,600
um,
shamanistic spiritual and hunting

2092
01:38:21,601 --> 01:38:25,050
relationship with these other animal
people.

2093
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:25,913
You know,

2094
01:38:25,930 --> 01:38:27,370
well,
the first time I went deer hunting,

2095
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:32,380
I really do believe that like locking
eyes on that deer and about being about

2096
01:38:33,011 --> 01:38:33,844
to shoot it,
I feel,

2097
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:37,420
I felt like it was some weird
psychedelic experience in some sort of a

2098
01:38:37,421 --> 01:38:39,910
strange way.
It almost felt like I had taken a drug

2099
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:44,800
because I felt like there was some
strange connection or some strange

2100
01:38:44,801 --> 01:38:48,640
frequency that I had tuned into that
never been a part of before.

2101
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:52,030
I'd never experienced that before.
Now I could,

2102
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:54,070
you know,
I had a protein bar in my pocket.

2103
01:38:54,071 --> 01:38:56,350
I can go back to camp.
We had a cooler full of food.

2104
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:00,910
I was still pretty detached even while
being interconnected.

2105
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,900
But those people that painted those
paintings on the walls in the caves in

2106
01:39:05,901 --> 01:39:09,190
France,
they were desperately connected,

2107
01:39:09,191 --> 01:39:14,191
intensely connected and they were
without the burden of our are are these

2108
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:21,280
sort of strange moral ideas we have
about what's okay to eat and what's not

2109
01:39:21,281 --> 01:39:23,560
okay to eat and what's ethical and
what's not ethical.

2110
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:25,450
They were free from those burdens.

2111
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:30,010
And yet in,
in hunting cultures for thousands of

2112
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:32,860
years,
honey has been surrounded by ceremony,

2113
01:39:32,861 --> 01:39:36,280
right and ritual and you know,
been very much part of the religion

2114
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:38,680
celebration.
But also,

2115
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:40,330
um,
you know,

2116
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:44,260
ceremonies for,
for sending the hunters out and

2117
01:39:44,261 --> 01:39:49,261
ceremonies for welcoming them back in
because you are out there doing violence

2118
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:56,280
to another large mammal and those
ceremonies and those sort of a religious

2119
01:39:57,671 --> 01:40:02,671
or spiritual practices are different
from but also kind of similar to how

2120
01:40:03,671 --> 01:40:07,300
we've dealt again in,
in big time history,

2121
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:09,370
uh,
in the large scale,

2122
01:40:09,371 --> 01:40:11,140
how we've dealt with warfare.
You know,

2123
01:40:11,141 --> 01:40:14,740
how you send a warrior out and then
welcome on warrior back into the

2124
01:40:14,741 --> 01:40:17,530
community after he's gone out and done
violence to other human,

2125
01:40:17,531 --> 01:40:19,540
to other humans.
And that case is different.

2126
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,430
And yet they're also,
you know,

2127
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,640
if you're doing two other animal people,
so you know,

2128
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:25,150
the buffalo people,
the dear people,

2129
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:28,870
um,
there is still a similar,

2130
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:32,410
you know,
moral ambiguity about this,

2131
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:33,370
you know,
it's,

2132
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:37,240
they were free in a sense from some of
the baggage we carry now.

2133
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:38,650
Sure,
I think you're right.

2134
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:44,220
But was there still moral ambiguity
about taking life and needing to respect

2135
01:40:45,611 --> 01:40:48,580
that animal by using it fully?
And I think so.

2136
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,820
There was ambiguity,
but there was certainly probably a

2137
01:40:51,821 --> 01:40:54,040
deeper reverence,
um,

2138
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:57,550
and an understanding of the,
these were inevitable decisions that

2139
01:40:57,551 --> 01:41:00,820
people had a Mac,
whether it's to defend your life against

2140
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:03,640
other humans that want to take your life
and can take their life instead,

2141
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:06,730
or whether it was to eat an animal that
you hunted.

2142
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:08,920
There were,
there were sort of unavoidable.

2143
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:11,540
I think so.
Um,

2144
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,780
I mean,
what year do you think it was for?

2145
01:41:13,781 --> 01:41:18,460
The first Vegan was invented,
it was it the eighties.

2146
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:20,680
I'll probably tell you earlier than
that.

2147
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:23,440
Sixties could be,
I have no idea.

2148
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:26,080
But it had to be within a hundred years.
Right.

2149
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:29,170
I mean vegetarianism,
it's been around for a long time.

2150
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,300
It's been around for a long time.
Even here,

2151
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:35,920
I mean since the 18 hundreds came over
as part of this Christian group from,

2152
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:37,810
from England,
um,

2153
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:41,320
and has been around in other parts of
the world for much longer,

2154
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:43,120
you know,
in India and other parts of the world.

2155
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:47,410
Um,
veganism is I think a relatively new

2156
01:41:47,411 --> 01:41:50,770
invention.
Tammy's got to answer the Vegan society.

2157
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,240
1944.
Okay.

2158
01:41:52,241 --> 01:41:54,520
A couple of decades off the first modern
day vegans,

2159
01:41:54,521 --> 01:41:58,720
in November of 1944,
Donald Watson called a meeting with five

2160
01:41:58,721 --> 01:42:03,721
other nondairy vegetarians including
Elise Shrigley to discuss nondairy

2161
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:09,050
vegetarian diets and lifestyles.
All right.

2162
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:12,910
Forward.
And he died of a common cold a week

2163
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:13,743
later.

2164
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:22,590
So that's what he was a non dairy eating
vegetarian in 1944 that was back before

2165
01:42:23,861 --> 01:42:26,890
they really totally understood how to
get your vitamins and what the amino

2166
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:31,891
acid profiles of vegetables were too.
So taking somewhere chances back then.

2167
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:33,880
Yeah,
no,

2168
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:37,210
I probably had very little little idea
what they were doing nutritionally and

2169
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:40,870
well that's the weird thing too,
when people like the show a picture of a

2170
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:43,450
gorilla and show the gorilla only eats
vegetables,

2171
01:42:43,451 --> 01:42:44,600
you can do it too.
Um,

2172
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:46,420
or you know,
we're not gross.

2173
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:49,180
Try feeding the cat on the vegetables.
They go blind.

2174
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,290
Yeah,
they did not.

2175
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:53,320
They did not do do well and then people
still do it.

2176
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,790
I know,
I heard you were talking about that on

2177
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,400
one of your shows reading about it
today.

2178
01:42:57,401 --> 01:42:59,230
I was reading another article about it
today,

2179
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:02,140
this morning about Vegan cat owners.
Yeah.

2180
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:03,613
It's tricky.

2181
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,350
It's tricky.
Go Blind.

2182
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:06,760
Yeah,
it's not,

2183
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,590
they're obligate carnivores.
They must eat well.

2184
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:14,760
So much so that they actually have to
add taurine to cat food because a lot of

2185
01:43:15,161 --> 01:43:20,161
cat food just in the process of loses
that loses taurine like they're brutal.

2186
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:23,890
They are the fucking cleanup crew of
nature.

2187
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,010
The cats and anything with a limp gets
taken out.

2188
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:30,790
You know,
and I have these two cute fluffy ragdoll

2189
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:32,590
cats.
They're the sweetest cats in the world,

2190
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,770
but they're fucking vicious man.
They're vicious to each other.

2191
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:38,590
They definitely a vicious,
the catch something outside.

2192
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:42,580
I had kept,
my cat was 18 years old and she killed a

2193
01:43:42,581 --> 01:43:44,590
bird in the courtyard.
Fucking,

2194
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,400
yeah.
Teen.

2195
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:48,430
The estimates on the number of wild
birds,

2196
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:51,130
you know,
songbirds that are killed by cats,

2197
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:54,270
both,
both domestic and feral in the states is

2198
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:56,660
it's like a billion a year.

2199
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:58,610
I'm not kidding you.
It,

2200
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:01,400
they think it's the,
the biggest threat,

2201
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:06,520
I believe it's estimated to be the
biggest threat to a wild songbirds in

2202
01:44:07,131 --> 01:44:10,430
North America because cas,
they are hunters.

2203
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:12,590
They are hardcore and there's way too
many of them.

2204
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,780
There's so many of them.
And you know,

2205
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:16,540
people love them as pets.
Yeah.

2206
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:18,290
Here it goes.
Three point billion,

2207
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:23,291
7 billion birds annually.
All my God.

2208
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:29,270
Cats that live in the wild or indoor
pets allowed to roam outdoors,

2209
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:34,300
kill from 1.4 billion to as many as 3.7
billion birds in the continental u s

2210
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,310
each year,
each year,

2211
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:42,910
3.7 billion birds in the continental
United States.

2212
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,910
So your kitty cat and that bird feeder
bad.

2213
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:50,740
Oh my God.
That is amazing.

2214
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:52,680
That's amazing.
Yeah.

2215
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:55,880
That's amazing.
What a crazy animal a cat is.

2216
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:59,930
They're just these little killers that
allow us to take care of them and they

2217
01:44:59,931 --> 01:45:02,060
pick them up and they per,
because they just can't eat you.

2218
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:02,923
You're just too big.

2219
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:08,950
That's really the relationship.
It's my friend is a cop much better than

2220
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:10,230
saber tooth tigers.
Yeah.

2221
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:13,430
My friend's a cop and he said one of the
craziest things was where they would

2222
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:17,960
find people that had died in their house
and they have gats like conscious,

2223
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,020
go right for your face,
eat your face off.

2224
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:23,960
So they'd find this person who had died,
you know,

2225
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:26,060
we could go and they just ran out of cat
food.

2226
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:31,550
The cat just eats your face.
What is this domestic oh six point

2227
01:45:32,631 --> 01:45:37,460
9000000020.7 billion mammals.
Mostly mice.

2228
01:45:37,461 --> 01:45:38,360
Shrews,
rabbits,

2229
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:40,880
squirrels.
And I don't know what a volt aa is.

2230
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:41,850
Vol.
Yeah.

2231
01:45:41,851 --> 01:45:44,300
It's like,
it's like a mouse a little bit each year

2232
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:49,330
according to a study published last year
in nature communications that you saying

2233
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:55,300
between 1.4 and 3.7 billion birds and
6.9 and 20.7 billion mammals.

2234
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:03,220
While I'm not a big fan of mice,
so fuck 'em I like cats.

2235
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:05,870
Not,
not big into mice.

2236
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:09,340
I pick sides.
We all pick.

2237
01:46:09,341 --> 01:46:10,220
So we did.
We do.

2238
01:46:10,221 --> 01:46:11,054
You know,
and that's,

2239
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:14,660
you know,
when we have a cat that's part of our

2240
01:46:14,661 --> 01:46:17,690
family or a dog as part of our family,
and obviously they're,

2241
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:21,560
they're very different species,
but they become family,

2242
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:26,270
you know?
And that's another vegetarian argument

2243
01:46:26,271 --> 01:46:28,820
that has a real logic to it and has an
ethic to it of well,

2244
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:33,290
you wouldn't eat your dog.
Why would you eat a deer or a cow?

2245
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:34,153
Right.

2246
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:36,043
And yet

2247
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:40,980
we as,
as a species,

2248
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:42,270
you know,
we're very tribal.

2249
01:46:42,330 --> 01:46:46,230
We identify with a group,
whether that's all humans or whether we

2250
01:46:46,231 --> 01:46:47,130
have,
you know,

2251
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:49,590
will that become dogs,
you know?

2252
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,130
Yeah.
And Hunt with us or,

2253
01:46:51,170 --> 01:46:54,060
or cats that we,
that we adopt for various reasons and

2254
01:46:54,061 --> 01:46:55,800
that,
you know,

2255
01:46:55,801 --> 01:46:59,010
that group becomes,
you know,

2256
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:01,050
family.
You don't have your family.

2257
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,130
No.
Well,

2258
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:03,510
if you ever watched that,
um,

2259
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,730
Penn and teller show,
ah,

2260
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,570
bullshit,
they had an episode on animal activists

2261
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,110
and the people for the ethical treatment
of animals,

2262
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:15,600
like,
like what the roots of their argument

2263
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:17,790
and their ideas are,
they don't want pets.

2264
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:20,730
They don't think we should have any
captive animals.

2265
01:47:20,731 --> 01:47:22,260
No pets,
no pet dogs,

2266
01:47:22,261 --> 01:47:25,050
no pet cats.
Everything's free to roam and do as it

2267
01:47:25,051 --> 01:47:26,780
will.
Um,

2268
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,040
and no eating any animals,
which is like,

2269
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:30,780
oh,
what kind of,

2270
01:47:30,781 --> 01:47:31,950
where are we going to live in then?

2271
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:32,760
Well,
there was a,

2272
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:36,350
there's a fascinating,
I think it was a Cleveland Amery who,

2273
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,370
one of the founders of the fund for
animals.

2274
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,230
I believe I have this right.
Um,

2275
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,750
had a vision,
you know,

2276
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:43,560
of,
you know,

2277
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:48,510
the future world and it was separate
predators and prey separate them.

2278
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:49,860
Like in the,
in the wild,

2279
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:53,490
like,
so how do the predators eat magic magic

2280
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:56,370
unicorns?
I mean,

2281
01:47:56,371 --> 01:47:57,330
yeah,
I mean,

2282
01:47:57,331 --> 01:48:00,540
that's hilarious.
So he wanted to stop any sort of cruelty

2283
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:01,760
even in nature,
right?

2284
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,380
Right.
Well then you're gonna get cannibalism

2285
01:48:04,381 --> 01:48:05,790
done.
I mean,

2286
01:48:05,791 --> 01:48:08,970
there's already a huge problem with
cannibalism and the bear community like

2287
01:48:08,971 --> 01:48:11,670
bears,
when male bears come out of dens,

2288
01:48:11,671 --> 01:48:14,580
they actively search for cubs.
They want to eat cubs.

2289
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:18,180
It's one of the first things they do.
They do it to try to bring the female to

2290
01:48:18,181 --> 01:48:20,370
estrus.
And they also do it because they're

2291
01:48:20,371 --> 01:48:22,320
hungry and they,
they're cannibals.

2292
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:23,990
When I was,
um,

2293
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:27,540
in Alberta,
some friends of mine run a hunting camp

2294
01:48:27,541 --> 01:48:32,541
up there and they saw a male bear kill a
female bear's cub.

2295
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,240
And um,
the female chased the mail off the

2296
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:41,241
carcass and then the female finished it
off her own baby.

2297
01:48:41,990 --> 01:48:45,150
She's eight at once it was dead.
She started eating it and they were

2298
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:46,260
like,
whoa.

2299
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,760
And they said they had been around.
I mean,

2300
01:48:47,761 --> 01:48:49,650
these people,
they live in northern Alberta.

2301
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:52,320
Okay.
They've been around some animals and

2302
01:48:52,321 --> 01:48:53,940
wildlife their whole life.
And they were like,

2303
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:55,020
eat free.
Even for us,

2304
01:48:55,021 --> 01:48:56,370
that was like,
whoa.

2305
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,233
Yeah.

2306
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:01,410
Because there's really good
documentation and research also,

2307
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:03,480
you know,
that animals and not just,

2308
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:06,840
you know,
Orkos there's some dolphin,

2309
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:10,930
something that we assume is or bill or
have good evidence that they're at a

2310
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:13,170
really intelligent,
um,

2311
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:18,060
that they have a wide emotional range,
you know,

2312
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:23,270
and including grief,
including mourning for the death of

2313
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:26,040
family members,
including their,

2314
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:27,240
you know,
the calf.

2315
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:28,870
You know.
Um,

2316
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:30,600
so there's,
it's,

2317
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:33,990
and I think this is one of the
unfortunate things that happens is that

2318
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,570
when we get into these black and white
struggles,

2319
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:39,000
you know,
hunters versus animal rights activists

2320
01:49:39,001 --> 01:49:42,060
or anything like that and he's similar
kind of black and white,

2321
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:47,620
is that
each side has its argument and each site

2322
01:49:47,621 --> 01:49:52,150
doesn't really want to acknowledge too
much that there might be some validity

2323
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:57,690
to either the argument on the other side
or just to the reality of the world.

2324
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:02,950
Like animals have feelings,
not just they can physically suffer,

2325
01:50:02,951 --> 01:50:04,730
but they have emotional,
you know,

2326
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:06,580
they have emotions.
You can see it in your dog.

2327
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:11,020
You can see it in wild animals.
Sometimes they have emotions and that's

2328
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:13,900
tough.
And often on the hunting side it'd be,

2329
01:50:13,901 --> 01:50:16,360
oh,
that's just so-called anthropomorphism.

2330
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:16,990
We're,
we're,

2331
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:21,460
you're just projecting human.
While there's pretty good research on a

2332
01:50:21,461 --> 01:50:25,410
wide range of species that they have
emotions as well as the ability to

2333
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:28,520
physically feel pain and suffer.
Uh,

2334
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:33,900
and
I think it's really helpful when we get

2335
01:50:34,031 --> 01:50:37,450
into these kinds of conversations across
those lines to be able to at least

2336
01:50:37,451 --> 01:50:39,130
acknowledge,
you know,

2337
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:42,640
yeah.
Or acknowledge where,

2338
01:50:42,641 --> 01:50:43,474
you know,

2339
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:46,320
Peta,
you know,

2340
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:50,210
or other animal rights groups at least
not acknowledge where they're coming

2341
01:50:50,211 --> 01:50:52,400
from.
You might not agree with the arguments

2342
01:50:52,410 --> 01:50:54,170
that are conclusions,
you know,

2343
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,790
same as,
some people might not agree with you

2344
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:56,930
hunting,
you know,

2345
01:50:56,931 --> 01:50:59,510
but at least acknowledge there's a,
for you hunting,

2346
01:50:59,511 --> 01:51:02,990
there's a,
a valuable experience and an ethical

2347
01:51:02,991 --> 01:51:04,940
impulse to,
you know,

2348
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:07,460
confront what it means to eat meat,
for example,

2349
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:11,720
for Vegetarians and,
and animal rights activists of various

2350
01:51:11,721 --> 01:51:15,020
kinds.
There's an impulse to prevent suffering

2351
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,220
and respect life.
You know,

2352
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:22,700
they're honorable and understandable
impulses on both sides.

2353
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,340
Even if we don't agree with you know,
what all the kids,

2354
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:26,621
yeah,
I think,

2355
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:29,410
and I think it speaks to what we were
talking about earlier about reward

2356
01:51:29,411 --> 01:51:33,280
systems that are in place to ensure
survival and ensure certain types of

2357
01:51:33,281 --> 01:51:35,620
behavior and activities.
I mean it only makes sense that an

2358
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:38,920
animal would feel remorse if it's child
got killed.

2359
01:51:39,370 --> 01:51:42,160
That's why you take care of it and
protect it.

2360
01:51:42,161 --> 01:51:46,330
I mean if you've ever seen a mother cow
around it's calves,

2361
01:51:46,331 --> 01:51:49,620
if you go near those calves,
mother will go crazy and it's,

2362
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:53,560
there's built in systems that are
established to make sure that these

2363
01:51:53,561 --> 01:51:58,150
animals continue to procreate and
continue to stay alive and make sure

2364
01:51:58,151 --> 01:52:01,600
they have healthy populations.
It's just the same reason why our

2365
01:52:01,601 --> 01:52:04,990
emotions are in place.
I mean it's all really kind of a grand

2366
01:52:04,991 --> 01:52:09,850
scheme to ensure breeding and ensure
community and ensure all these that mean

2367
01:52:09,851 --> 01:52:13,630
we will call it emotions,
we'll call it civilization,

2368
01:52:13,631 --> 01:52:16,300
we'll call it communication between
sentient beings.

2369
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:20,830
But really it's what it is,
is all these different systems that are

2370
01:52:20,831 --> 01:52:23,770
established to make sure that we stay
together,

2371
01:52:23,950 --> 01:52:25,690
we keep together,
we breed,

2372
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:30,460
we ensure that we stay alive and
continue to have food and make sure we

2373
01:52:30,461 --> 01:52:32,800
make more people.
And I mean it's,

2374
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:35,470
I don't want to break it down it's crew
and say like,

2375
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:36,301
you know,
all,

2376
01:52:36,301 --> 01:52:38,890
all romance songs and every,
every book on,

2377
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:43,630
on companionship is bullshit.
Every movie that shows an awesome

2378
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:46,940
relationship is just a ridiculous
biological trick that's established to

2379
01:52:46,941 --> 01:52:49,580
make sure that you continue to stay
alive long enough to make more people.

2380
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:54,710
But really that's kind of what it is,
you know?

2381
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:55,441
I mean,
I don't,

2382
01:52:55,441 --> 01:53:00,441
I don't want to break it down so much to
that because I think there's beauty in

2383
01:53:00,531 --> 01:53:01,490
all of it.
You know,

2384
01:53:01,491 --> 01:53:03,710
there's beauty and love and oh look,
there's,

2385
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:07,430
in a strange way there's beauty and
watching that grizzly bear mall,

2386
01:53:07,431 --> 01:53:09,050
that Moose in the middle of the
driveway,

2387
01:53:09,051 --> 01:53:11,630
this beauty and watching that Martin
chase down that rabbit.

2388
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,420
I wouldn't want to be the rabbit,
but I'm not really sure I want to be the

2389
01:53:14,421 --> 01:53:15,830
martin either.
You know,

2390
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:16,900
I mean,
I don't,

2391
01:53:16,901 --> 01:53:20,540
I don't think I have to identify with it
to appreciate the spectacle,

2392
01:53:20,650 --> 01:53:23,330
the amazing spectacle that nature is
providing.

2393
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,220
And you know,
the,

2394
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:27,590
we,
we throw the word awesome around a lot

2395
01:53:27,591 --> 01:53:28,340
now,
you know,

2396
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:29,720
the last 10,
20 years.

2397
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:34,040
But the old word,
awe know the power of that.

2398
01:53:34,041 --> 01:53:37,040
And there's beauty,
but there's also sometimes borderline

2399
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:38,510
horror fear.
But,

2400
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:45,130
but nature is awesome in that life and
death and our own lives and deaths,

2401
01:53:45,970 --> 01:53:47,060
you know,
the creation of life,

2402
01:53:47,061 --> 01:53:50,390
the taking of life,
watching it happen around us doing it,

2403
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:53,300
it's theirs off.
And there's beauty.

2404
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:55,910
There is undeniable,
undeniable,

2405
01:53:55,911 --> 01:53:56,780
ah,
you know,

2406
01:53:56,781 --> 01:54:00,260
I watched this documentary on Komodo
dragons and they're intense.

2407
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:02,900
Oh my God,
there's so gross.

2408
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:05,320
But they're so awesome and they're
gross.

2409
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:10,190
Snus and one of the things about it was
how they will bite like a water buffalo

2410
01:54:10,191 --> 01:54:14,200
on the leg and their mouth is so toxic,
really toxic,

2411
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:18,200
so toxic with bacteria in their saliva,
sub funky,

2412
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:21,230
that just one bite and that thing's
dead.

2413
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,390
So they just follow it,
wait around,

2414
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:27,380
and they wait around a couple of days.
And slowly but surely all the toxic shit

2415
01:54:27,381 --> 01:54:28,250
from their mouth.
Like,

2416
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:29,091
Oh yeah,
no,

2417
01:54:29,091 --> 01:54:30,380
thank you.
Yeah,

2418
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:33,290
that's not even,
you don't even see their teeth.

2419
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:35,780
And that one,
like look at the one above it where you

2420
01:54:35,781 --> 01:54:38,570
see their teeth.
Oh God.

2421
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:41,330
I mean,
what a crazy animal.

2422
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:45,740
And that's another thing that I think is
amazing and beautiful is just the

2423
01:54:45,741 --> 01:54:49,580
biodiversity of the world that these,
and I think,

2424
01:54:49,581 --> 01:54:51,740
again,
I hate to keep bringing up the same

2425
01:54:51,741 --> 01:54:53,450
theme,
but I think we've done ourselves a

2426
01:54:53,451 --> 01:54:55,880
disservice by creating these cities.

2427
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:59,000
We've done ourselves an amazing service
in that.

2428
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:01,390
Look at that.
All the Fox,

2429
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,250
which ruled off of his face.
What a fucking,

2430
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:06,830
I was like drastic park or something.
He'd be the monster.

2431
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:11,390
Komodo dragons are funky slide coming
out of his mouth.

2432
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,430
But we've done ourselves.
I mean,

2433
01:55:13,431 --> 01:55:15,560
we've made an incredible thing,
you know,

2434
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:18,500
it's incredible that we,
we don't have to go out and hunt our

2435
01:55:18,501 --> 01:55:20,170
food.
So because of that we could develop by

2436
01:55:20,171 --> 01:55:22,430
phones.
We could figure out how to make four g

2437
01:55:22,431 --> 01:55:27,431
lte and better laptops and cars that
drive themselves and all this cool shit

2438
01:55:27,831 --> 01:55:29,300
that we have.
It's amazing.

2439
01:55:29,301 --> 01:55:33,830
It's great because without,
without our easy access to food,

2440
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:36,950
none,
no one would have the free time to

2441
01:55:36,951 --> 01:55:40,640
develop all this stuff.
So I think it's imperative that we do

2442
01:55:40,641 --> 01:55:44,220
have cities imperative that we do have
an easy supply of food because

2443
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:48,480
you're not gonna get all this electronic
equipment and all this stuff that we

2444
01:55:48,481 --> 01:55:50,760
have.
We're just not going to get it if

2445
01:55:50,761 --> 01:55:54,030
everybody has to forage.
So we've,

2446
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:59,210
we've enriched our lives in this way,
but in doing so,

2447
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,520
we've somehow,
or another forgotten that there were a

2448
01:56:02,521 --> 01:56:06,150
part of this wild world.
We're part of wildlife,

2449
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:10,380
we are wildlife.
We're just not wild anymore.

2450
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:15,660
We're wa or if we are wild,
we're not wild in the sense that the way

2451
01:56:15,961 --> 01:56:18,090
we look at the rest of the wild world,
but,

2452
01:56:18,091 --> 01:56:19,260
right.
But we are,

2453
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:21,750
sure,
and I mean there's,

2454
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:24,600
there's arguments in anthropology that
actually,

2455
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:28,110
there were lots of societies that had a
lot more leisure time than we do.

2456
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:29,551
You know,
hunting,

2457
01:56:29,551 --> 01:56:30,630
gathering societies.
It's been,

2458
01:56:30,631 --> 01:56:31,860
you know,
four to five hours a day,

2459
01:56:31,861 --> 01:56:34,800
quote unquote working hunting and
gathering and had lots of time for,

2460
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:37,830
you know,
ceremonies and all kinds of other

2461
01:56:37,831 --> 01:56:39,450
things.
It depends on where you are in the world

2462
01:56:39,451 --> 01:56:40,860
and how harsh the conditions were,
but,

2463
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:42,150
but the,
you know,

2464
01:56:42,151 --> 01:56:43,770
sort of the original leisure society
May,

2465
01:56:43,771 --> 01:56:46,250
it may have predated.
He did agriculture,

2466
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:47,620
certainly they had no i-phones and
maybe,

2467
01:56:47,621 --> 01:56:48,454
maybe that was a blessing,

2468
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:51,220
who knows.
But four or five hours of hunting and

2469
01:56:51,221 --> 01:56:53,680
gathering is exhausting,
you know,

2470
01:56:53,681 --> 01:56:56,320
and you really don't have enough time to
develop a car.

2471
01:56:56,740 --> 01:56:57,550
No,
no cars.

2472
01:56:57,550 --> 01:56:59,110
Yeah.
After you've figured that out,

2473
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:01,240
after you've done your hunting and
gathering,

2474
01:57:01,241 --> 01:57:04,600
then it's about cooking and,
but also there's no days off because you

2475
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:05,860
don't have any refrigeration.

2476
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,360
Right.
Depending on,

2477
01:57:07,361 --> 01:57:08,450
you know,
depending on your climate.

2478
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,190
I mean,
they could,

2479
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:11,320
they could try things and do certain
things,

2480
01:57:11,321 --> 01:57:13,320
but clearly,
clearly not the,

2481
01:57:13,330 --> 01:57:17,050
not a frigidaire around the corner,
but you know what you're talking about,

2482
01:57:17,051 --> 01:57:20,590
about whether it's cities or just modern
society,

2483
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:23,800
that
high tech,

2484
01:57:23,950 --> 01:57:27,070
high speed world that most of us live
in,

2485
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:29,950
where many of us don't feel like we have
much free time and we're running around

2486
01:57:29,951 --> 01:57:32,230
and doing all these things in cities.
Usually.

2487
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:36,580
Um,
when I talk to people who become hunters

2488
01:57:36,581 --> 01:57:37,414
as adults,

2489
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:41,580
by and large,
that's part of why they did it.

2490
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:44,070
They want it to reconnect.
Yeah.

2491
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:45,960
You know,
it's part of why they garden.

2492
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:48,780
It's part of why they raised chickens.
It's part of why they do all sorts of

2493
01:57:48,781 --> 01:57:52,440
other things that you understand and
value to.

2494
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:56,190
They want to get back in touch with
those.

2495
01:57:56,220 --> 01:58:00,810
Not only the hands on skills,
but just the world they inhabit.

2496
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:06,080
You know,
beyond the domesticated concretized city

2497
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:07,790
concretize,
you know,

2498
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:10,500
you know that word,
you know the pavement,

2499
01:58:10,501 --> 01:58:13,520
you know,
beyond the payment into nature and

2500
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:18,560
whether it's a little garden patch in
your backyard or hunting around the

2501
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:20,850
Missouri breaks,
you know,

2502
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:26,160
there's a sense of wanting to reconnect
so that all of these practices,

2503
01:58:26,911 --> 01:58:28,170
hunting,
gardening,

2504
01:58:28,171 --> 01:58:32,280
raising chickens in part are like an
antidote

2505
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:35,140
to modern life.
You know,

2506
01:58:35,141 --> 01:58:38,170
people want to reconnect to some of that
or is it,

2507
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:42,040
or are we clinging to the past and
trying to ward

2508
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,600
off the inevitable?
Right.

2509
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:48,250
Are we trying to ward it off this
inevitable symbiotic relationship we're

2510
01:58:48,251 --> 01:58:50,370
going to have to,
computers are going to be a planet or

2511
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:51,280
hoard.
Yeah.

2512
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:52,510
Well,
you know,

2513
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:54,420
have you read Richard Lubes work at all?
No.

2514
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,100
He um,
he was a journalist,

2515
01:58:57,101 --> 01:59:00,820
I believe for many years.
His first really famous book was called

2516
01:59:00,821 --> 01:59:03,940
last child in the woods.
And then his followup book was called

2517
01:59:03,941 --> 01:59:06,560
the nature principle.
And how long ago?

2518
01:59:06,561 --> 01:59:07,960
This is kind of,
um,

2519
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:10,900
let's see.
Last child in the woods came out,

2520
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,990
what,
2006.

2521
01:59:13,991 --> 01:59:15,490
I could be wrong about that date.
We'll,

2522
01:59:15,491 --> 01:59:16,570
we'll know in a moment,
I think.

2523
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:19,510
Um,
but you know,

2524
01:59:19,511 --> 01:59:23,560
his argument is in part,
how do you spell the last name?

2525
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:24,940
L.
O.

2526
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:25,990
U.
V right there.

2527
01:59:25,991 --> 01:59:27,880
I'm sure this,
it looks very serious.

2528
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:29,080
Look at him.
He's a,

2529
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:30,850
he's a neat guy.
Um,

2530
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:37,290
and his argument is that we all need
nature for our mental,

2531
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:39,760
physical,
emotional,

2532
01:59:39,761 --> 01:59:40,630
spiritual health.

2533
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:45,160
First he focused on kids and then he
moved it to focusing on 2005,

2534
01:59:45,161 --> 01:59:46,950
I guess it was the first book.
Um,

2535
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:52,800
and he says that actually the more high
tech we get,

2536
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:57,880
the more we need these sorts of
experiences.

2537
01:59:57,881 --> 01:59:58,251
And he,
he's,

2538
01:59:58,251 --> 02:00:02,020
he's not a hunter,
but he does fish and he spends a lot of

2539
02:00:02,021 --> 02:00:07,021
time outdoors and that we need that
neurologically mean,

2540
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,420
not just,
um,

2541
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:13,030
in some romantic sort of throwback
fantasy.

2542
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:15,970
But we deeply need it because we are
wild.

2543
02:00:15,971 --> 02:00:19,270
And what does he use to establish that
argument that we need it?

2544
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,790
I mean,
he's got all kinds of,

2545
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:23,200
you know,
research and you know,

2546
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:25,970
umpteen citations of,
of different sorts of,

2547
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:31,000
of studies and cultures and different
things that happen to kids at first.

2548
02:00:31,481 --> 02:00:33,190
And his first book and then,
and then two adults,

2549
02:00:33,191 --> 02:00:36,580
if we're deprived of that,
if we're always in front of a screen,

2550
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:40,150
for example,
if we're just never out in the dirt,

2551
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:42,130
you know,
never out in the woods.

2552
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:47,230
Um,
we certainly evolved in the real world

2553
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:48,880
in nature,
not in cities.

2554
02:00:48,881 --> 02:00:49,830
Right.
Um,

2555
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:52,240
and our,
you know,

2556
02:00:52,241 --> 02:00:57,241
we're hardwired for that three
dimensional textured,

2557
02:00:59,340 --> 02:00:59,980
um,
I mean,

2558
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:01,510
I guess there's textures in the city
too,

2559
02:01:01,511 --> 02:01:04,060
but,
but that kind of natural surrounding,

2560
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:09,420
I'm in whatever climate,
that's what really nourishes us,

2561
02:01:10,721 --> 02:01:15,721
not just physically in terms of food,
but keeps us sort of sane at some level

2562
02:01:16,450 --> 02:01:19,360
as a degree.
We're still saying,

2563
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:21,880
yeah,
that's the argument.

2564
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:26,910
Are we saying and is saying even a re a
rational request or,

2565
02:01:27,130 --> 02:01:29,020
uh,
just,

2566
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:30,730
uh,
hope is it,

2567
02:01:30,731 --> 02:01:32,040
is it,
what is saying?

2568
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:35,800
What is sanity and our sanity?
What's health in comparison to the

2569
02:01:35,801 --> 02:01:39,160
Saturday of someone who lives in a
tribal environment in the Amazon?

2570
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:40,070
I mean,
they

2571
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:41,930
would look at us and laugh and go,
yeah,

2572
02:01:41,931 --> 02:01:44,000
you're not saying you people are fucking
crazy.

2573
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:45,480
He went crazy for 2000 years.
Yet.

2574
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:47,110
What are you doing?
You know,

2575
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:49,010
like,
I don't know who's right because I don't

2576
02:01:49,011 --> 02:01:50,240
want to live in the jungle.
Right.

2577
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:50,931
You know?
I mean,

2578
02:01:50,931 --> 02:01:54,260
I think they're crazy.
Like you don't even have tvs and it's

2579
02:01:54,261 --> 02:01:56,330
easy to,
it's easy to have that either or like

2580
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:58,590
now in the city,
you know,

2581
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:02,540
or where in the Amazonian jungle.
Yeah,

2582
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:06,200
no,
this is not some kind of romantic

2583
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:06,711
throwback.
Oh,

2584
02:02:06,711 --> 02:02:08,240
we should go back to the garden.
You know,

2585
02:02:08,241 --> 02:02:12,290
it's not that.
But that these experiences that you

2586
02:02:12,291 --> 02:02:15,320
know,
the experiences that you have gardening

2587
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:19,130
with the experiences you have hunting
are deeply human,

2588
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:24,580
valuable experiences for us.
And to not have them have a culture and

2589
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:28,730
they have an individual life or a whole
society that has no connection.

2590
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:31,790
It's all supermarket.
It's all drive thru,

2591
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,160
but big MACs,
you know,

2592
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:38,870
during the time that we're not hunting
and we're not gathering and we're not

2593
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:43,850
farming.
There's time for philosophical pursuits,

2594
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:48,260
creation of literature,
all sorts of writing and different

2595
02:02:48,261 --> 02:02:51,770
communication and wonderful
conversations over meals.

2596
02:02:51,771 --> 02:02:55,490
You had no part in creating and the
building of community and the bonding of

2597
02:02:55,491 --> 02:02:58,880
friendships in the evolving of ideas
that a lot of these things can be

2598
02:02:58,881 --> 02:03:02,480
thought of by some people as being more
valuable than the collection of food.

2599
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:03,980
Sure,
absolutely.

2600
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,420
Uh,
they could be,

2601
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:10,510
and I think that the,
the risk is in having it be like,

2602
02:03:11,570 --> 02:03:13,520
oh,
we have to go back to the woods and live

2603
02:03:13,521 --> 02:03:15,960
in the woods to be real humans.
No,

2604
02:03:16,170 --> 02:03:16,540
no,
no,

2605
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:16,990
no,
no.

2606
02:03:16,990 --> 02:03:21,020
That's not,
or say that's just ancient history.

2607
02:03:21,530 --> 02:03:24,560
Give it up.
Stop having these fantasies about the

2608
02:03:24,561 --> 02:03:25,130
past.

2609
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:27,480
Just live in our cyborg future,
right.

2610
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:31,030
To be healthy human beings.
Whether it's uh,

2611
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:33,170
you know,
just to walk in a park or being part of

2612
02:03:33,171 --> 02:03:35,480
a community garden in a city,
you don't have to leave the city.

2613
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:38,570
You can have some experiences of
connection with the,

2614
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:40,070
you know,
the earth,

2615
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:41,990
right.
In La,

2616
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:44,660
you know,
you can have some,

2617
02:03:44,661 --> 02:03:45,411
some,
well,

2618
02:03:45,411 --> 02:03:48,140
I always wonder,
and this is like a reoccurring theme

2619
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:49,250
with me,
like what are we,

2620
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:51,860
what are,
what are we doing as a race,

2621
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:55,340
as a species?
Like if you could step outside of

2622
02:03:55,341 --> 02:03:57,800
ourselves,
if you could hover a mile above earth

2623
02:03:57,860 --> 02:04:01,550
and your objective free from any
influence of our culture,

2624
02:04:01,551 --> 02:04:05,300
you are some calculating being that sort
of as gathering up all the data and

2625
02:04:05,301 --> 02:04:08,810
information and all the behavior
patterns that you're seeing exhibited by

2626
02:04:08,811 --> 02:04:11,630
this bizarre species.
What is this thing doing?

2627
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:14,240
Well,
this thing is creating technology.

2628
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:15,410
That's what it's doing.
It's,

2629
02:04:15,411 --> 02:04:18,920
it's,
it's involved in some sort of uh,

2630
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:23,950
ever accelerating path of innovation
ever accelerating path of creating new

2631
02:04:26,901 --> 02:04:30,710
and better technology,
new and better devices,

2632
02:04:30,711 --> 02:04:34,370
new and better things,
and it works all day in order to obtain

2633
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:38,250
the latest and greatest of these things.
And that therefore fueling

2634
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:43,250
the creation of these things while
longing for the past while longing for

2635
02:04:43,891 --> 02:04:47,430
some little house in the prairie type
fucking situation where,

2636
02:04:47,431 --> 02:04:49,620
you know,
everybody died of polio and those

2637
02:04:49,621 --> 02:04:52,260
terrible time to be alive,
but you look at it on tv and you're

2638
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:52,981
like,
oh,

2639
02:04:52,981 --> 02:04:55,430
it was awesome back then.
My grandpa.

2640
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:56,130
Yeah,
we,

2641
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:59,460
we long towards the simple past we
longed towards,

2642
02:04:59,740 --> 02:05:02,670
you know,
people that would hold hands in front of

2643
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:04,600
the dinner table.
And say our prayers and,

2644
02:05:04,601 --> 02:05:08,460
and everybody was a good person except
for the few bad people wore black hats.

2645
02:05:08,461 --> 02:05:10,440
You could spot him a mile away.
You know,

2646
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:14,640
I think in this ever more and more
complex life.

2647
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:18,000
We,
we long towards this time where things

2648
02:05:18,001 --> 02:05:23,001
were simple and it's one of the things
that I believe is very appealing about

2649
02:05:23,881 --> 02:05:26,340
the idea of hunting and gathering your
own meat.

2650
02:05:26,341 --> 02:05:30,000
And it's very primally enriching because
we do,

2651
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:33,870
we do reward our,
our system.

2652
02:05:33,871 --> 02:05:37,380
We,
we give ourselves the opportunity to

2653
02:05:37,410 --> 02:05:40,860
participate in those reward systems that
are set up and they've been established

2654
02:05:40,861 --> 02:05:42,720
for thousands and thousands of
generations.

2655
02:05:42,721 --> 02:05:44,380
Yeah.
I mean it's one of the only ways.

2656
02:05:44,381 --> 02:05:44,480
Yes.

2657
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:45,560
Do so and that,
you know,

2658
02:05:45,590 --> 02:05:50,590
that experience that you talked about
like locking eyes with that deer and,

2659
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:53,990
and having that intense experience,
uh,

2660
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,050
have seen at your live the intense
experience of taking a life

2661
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:01,700
and how,
my sense as you were describing it is

2662
02:06:01,701 --> 02:06:06,020
that the,
the prime wellness of that in part is a

2663
02:06:06,021 --> 02:06:09,620
sense that this is really familiar.
Yes.

2664
02:06:09,621 --> 02:06:11,480
This is really old.
You know,

2665
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:14,810
like a cellular level memory.
This is old,

2666
02:06:14,811 --> 02:06:16,760
old stuff.
And you know,

2667
02:06:16,761 --> 02:06:17,780
for me,
when I,

2668
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:21,680
when I took my first year,
it was so shocking emotionally.

2669
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:23,120
Um,
I'm a shocking,

2670
02:06:23,121 --> 02:06:26,180
I finally succeeded.
I was surprised of the usage you try

2671
02:06:26,181 --> 02:06:27,014
for.
Um,

2672
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:30,770
I did not succeed the first three years.
Um,

2673
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:32,960
how many days were you going out?
It's a,

2674
02:06:32,970 --> 02:06:36,230
it's on the main season we have in
Vermont as a two week rifle season and I

2675
02:06:36,231 --> 02:06:38,120
wasn't able to hunt the full two weeks.

2676
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:39,710
Um,
usually it was,

2677
02:06:39,730 --> 02:06:42,380
you know,
less than half of that time probably,

2678
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:45,470
um,
a little bit in other seasons,

2679
02:06:45,471 --> 02:06:49,670
but mainly it was in the rifle season,
so it wasn't really years of hunting.

2680
02:06:49,970 --> 02:06:53,450
That was weeks of awning stretched out
over years.

2681
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:57,820
But the deeper shock was,
you know,

2682
02:06:57,830 --> 02:06:59,660
as you say it sort of that sense of loss
of life,

2683
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:02,990
you know,
that for me it was a sense of grief that

2684
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:05,400
this beautiful animals dead.
Right.

2685
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:10,900
And do I ever want to do that again?
I really wasn't sure at first.

2686
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:12,950
And you were by yourself this entire
time?

2687
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:14,300
When I took the deer.
Yeah.

2688
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:15,320
Yeah,
I was by myself.

2689
02:07:15,770 --> 02:07:18,650
Um,
and

2690
02:07:20,830 --> 02:07:24,610
it was the process over the next few
days of,

2691
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:26,890
of butchering that dear,

2692
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:29,613
that

2693
02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:32,550
felt really familiar.
You know,

2694
02:07:32,570 --> 02:07:34,850
it was almost like a ceremony.
I'll,

2695
02:07:34,890 --> 02:07:35,800
you know,
I was doing this,

2696
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,900
the knife and the,
you know,

2697
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:42,960
skinning and then in the kitchen with a
leg on and taking apart this amazing

2698
02:07:44,591 --> 02:07:47,740
animal,
all these layers of muscle and bone.

2699
02:07:47,741 --> 02:07:52,741
And that is what gave me the sense of
this is really old and familiar and I'll

2700
02:07:58,031 --> 02:08:00,160
probably do this again,
you know,

2701
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:02,230
in another year,
maybe not next week,

2702
02:08:02,231 --> 02:08:05,020
but next time deer season rolls around,
I'll probably hunt again.

2703
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:10,580
Um,
and that sense of deep sort of primal

2704
02:08:11,981 --> 02:08:13,700
familiarity,
um,

2705
02:08:13,950 --> 02:08:15,100
is common.
I mean,

2706
02:08:15,101 --> 02:08:18,250
I've heard,
I've read accounts of this people who

2707
02:08:18,251 --> 02:08:20,920
are not hunters,
but who have had a sort of hunting like

2708
02:08:20,921 --> 02:08:22,810
experience,
um,

2709
02:08:23,170 --> 02:08:26,180
uh,
George Monbiot or Mamby,

2710
02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:27,290
I'm not sure how you say it.
Um,

2711
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:31,750
he's from the UK and has advocated for
veganism and against beginnings at

2712
02:08:31,751 --> 02:08:34,190
various times and,
uh,

2713
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:35,570
or conflicted gun.
Yeah.

2714
02:08:36,430 --> 02:08:37,480
Uh,
but,

2715
02:08:37,481 --> 02:08:38,314
but,
uh,

2716
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:41,020
very much in ecology,
environmental advocate,

2717
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:44,740
he has this passage that he wrote about
having this experience of,

2718
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:50,130
I think it was being with a like a spear
going after fish,

2719
02:08:50,711 --> 02:08:53,590
like flounder in shallow water and his
ex,

2720
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:58,360
his account of it is very much,
this felt like it was thousands of years

2721
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:01,720
old.
Like this primal connection with ancient

2722
02:09:01,721 --> 02:09:04,630
human existence.
And I think it's valuable for people,

2723
02:09:04,631 --> 02:09:07,840
even if we live in a high tech world,
to have some connection to that.

2724
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:10,620
Well,
I think these are genetic imprints.

2725
02:09:10,670 --> 02:09:12,690
These are,
these are things that are written into

2726
02:09:12,691 --> 02:09:17,490
our code that it was really important
that you kill an animal in order to

2727
02:09:17,491 --> 02:09:20,190
survive x amount of thousands of years
ago.

2728
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:25,110
Those people that did that and bread,
I believe they gave that genetic

2729
02:09:25,111 --> 02:09:27,780
information to their offspring and they
carried on,

2730
02:09:27,781 --> 02:09:30,900
on and on and on.
And then when you tap into it,

2731
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:33,150
it lights up.
Like when I locked eyes,

2732
02:09:33,180 --> 02:09:37,350
that deer and the deer was bouncing
around on the side of this hill and it

2733
02:09:37,351 --> 02:09:40,590
saw me and I saw it and I locked eyes
with it.

2734
02:09:40,591 --> 02:09:42,330
And then I'm looking at it through the
rifle scope.

2735
02:09:42,570 --> 02:09:46,830
There was like this light bulb that went
off in this area of my mind that was

2736
02:09:46,831 --> 02:09:48,990
illuminated for the first time.
It was like,

2737
02:09:48,991 --> 02:09:52,380
check out this part,
like you don't even get in here without

2738
02:09:52,381 --> 02:09:53,214
doing this.

2739
02:09:53,310 --> 02:09:54,570
And it was like,
oh,

2740
02:09:54,571 --> 02:09:59,340
this is what the hunting thing is.
I get illuminates this ancient genetic

2741
02:09:59,910 --> 02:10:04,500
variable,
this ancient genetic pathway and it felt

2742
02:10:04,501 --> 02:10:07,500
psychedelic.
It felt like I was on a drug and I'm not

2743
02:10:07,501 --> 02:10:11,730
like not like a lustful,
I must kill and we know it was like this

2744
02:10:11,731 --> 02:10:13,800
weird sort of,
it's an altered state.

2745
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:15,400
Yes.
Animals,

2746
02:10:15,401 --> 02:10:18,450
spiritual connections.
Very strange.

2747
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:21,730
Strange experience,
which I was shocked.

2748
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,530
I was shocked.
I expected the sense of loss.

2749
02:10:25,770 --> 02:10:28,290
I expected the,
the sorrow.

2750
02:10:28,291 --> 02:10:30,900
I expected all these different,
the sorrow never really came.

2751
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:33,680
There was a sense of loss,
but there wasn't a sense did something

2752
02:10:33,681 --> 02:10:34,430
wrong.

2753
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:37,670
There wasn't a sense like I shouldn't
have done it and part of it was also

2754
02:10:37,671 --> 02:10:41,390
because I was seeing bones everywhere
and mountain lions shit.

2755
02:10:41,391 --> 02:10:43,700
I'm like,
this is the Goddamn war zone I'm in.

2756
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:45,040
You know,
when you're in the breaks,

2757
02:10:45,041 --> 02:10:47,090
you,
you find these ropes of shit.

2758
02:10:47,091 --> 02:10:52,091
And I say ropes because shit that was
filled with hair because these animals

2759
02:10:52,221 --> 02:10:55,250
were just jacking deer and whatever the
hell else they got ahold of.

2760
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:56,091
Well,
you know,

2761
02:10:56,091 --> 02:10:58,700
we're in a war zone.
It was a nature war zone.

2762
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:01,370
So I didn't,
I didn't for a bunch of reasons.

2763
02:11:01,371 --> 02:11:02,750
And also because I knew it was gonna eat
it.

2764
02:11:02,751 --> 02:11:06,260
I didn't feel bad about it,
but I did feel like,

2765
02:11:06,261 --> 02:11:08,930
wow,
this is intense.

2766
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:13,550
This is intense.
But the surprising part was the altered

2767
02:11:13,551 --> 02:11:16,970
state.
And I feel that still,

2768
02:11:16,971 --> 02:11:19,120
I mean,
it's changed over the years.

2769
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:21,890
I mean,
I've been hunting for the dozen years or

2770
02:11:21,890 --> 02:11:22,723
so now,
and it has,

2771
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:24,500
my experience has changed.

2772
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:24,681
It's,
no,

2773
02:11:24,681 --> 02:11:26,680
it wasn't,
it's not a shocking and quite as intense

2774
02:11:26,681 --> 02:11:29,450
as it was the first time,
but it still remains powerful.

2775
02:11:29,451 --> 02:11:34,451
And I'm still in an altered state for
like hours or days afterward and a state

2776
02:11:35,241 --> 02:11:39,860
of thankfulness too,
which is also like there's a warm

2777
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:42,140
happiness to it,
uh,

2778
02:11:42,141 --> 02:11:46,720
thankfulness that you are successful and
now you have this meat and you're going

2779
02:11:46,721 --> 02:11:48,680
to provide this mean to your family.
You know,

2780
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:52,060
like my friend Duncan sent me a photo of
some um,

2781
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:57,220
elk meat balls that his girlfriend had
cooked for them and their friend from an

2782
02:11:57,861 --> 02:12:00,200
elk that I,
some elk that I gave him.

2783
02:12:00,410 --> 02:12:05,410
And it made me feel so good that my
friend was eating some meat that I had

2784
02:12:05,571 --> 02:12:07,400
given him from an animal that I had
killed.

2785
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:08,241
I mean,
great.

2786
02:12:08,241 --> 02:12:11,300
You're grateful to the animal,
to the lands and then grateful to be

2787
02:12:11,301 --> 02:12:12,230
able to provide,
I mean,

2788
02:12:12,980 --> 02:12:14,300
I'm grateful that you,
you,

2789
02:12:14,301 --> 02:12:19,301
you have this established community
feeling bond feeling with your friend

2790
02:12:21,291 --> 02:12:24,320
who you give them meat and cooking this
meat and he takes a photo of it and,

2791
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:25,970
but it's all bizarre,
you know,

2792
02:12:25,971 --> 02:12:30,320
like this digital representation of this
thing and it's sent to you through the

2793
02:12:30,321 --> 02:12:33,260
air and smell it and arise on your
phone.

2794
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:33,650
You know,
like,

2795
02:12:33,650 --> 02:12:35,210
hey man,
we're in the woods,

2796
02:12:35,211 --> 02:12:37,080
Bros.
This is nature.

2797
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:39,410
It's kind of sort of weird,
you know?

2798
02:12:40,510 --> 02:12:41,330
Yeah,
it is.

2799
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:43,700
It's all,
it's all very odd.

2800
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:45,270
It's all very odd.
And I,

2801
02:12:45,271 --> 02:12:50,271
I do wonder if what I'm doing by getting
into hunting and is just clean til the

2802
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:56,800
last remaining gasps of a dying world.
It's possible.

2803
02:12:58,460 --> 02:12:59,810
Yeah.
It's possible.

2804
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,640
But I sure hope it's not really dying.
Do you do much hunting outside of your

2805
02:13:04,641 --> 02:13:07,070
home state of Vermont or is that mostly
what you do?

2806
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:08,630
That's mostly what I do.
I mean,

2807
02:13:08,631 --> 02:13:11,930
I've hunted a little bit Danna
Massachusetts where I have a friend and

2808
02:13:11,931 --> 02:13:13,700
my uncle,
um,

2809
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:17,150
I've got it out of state a little bit.
Do you go on trips?

2810
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:19,490
He said,
I've never got on a moose trip or I

2811
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:20,330
haven't,
I mean,

2812
02:13:20,690 --> 02:13:23,150
Moose technically do get hundred of
Vermont and small numbers.

2813
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:24,920
Um,
is it hard to get a tag?

2814
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:25,611
It is,
yeah,

2815
02:13:25,611 --> 02:13:28,010
because it's such small numbers.
Um,

2816
02:13:28,430 --> 02:13:30,920
but I haven't really,
except for when I was in New Mexico,

2817
02:13:30,921 --> 02:13:31,930
but was in New Mexico already

2818
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:32,990
for something else.
Right.

2819
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:36,130
And I've never really gone on,
uh,

2820
02:13:36,310 --> 02:13:40,050
a hunting trip somewhere far away.
And I dunno,

2821
02:13:40,690 --> 02:13:42,870
I might some point,
I have a friend who's been trying to get

2822
02:13:42,871 --> 02:13:46,020
me out to Colorado and I have,
I have a friend who lives in Colorado as

2823
02:13:46,021 --> 02:13:50,160
well for deer elk either either.
Um,

2824
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:51,360
and,
and I love,

2825
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:53,340
you know,
this particular friend in Colorado I'm

2826
02:13:53,341 --> 02:13:54,450
thinking of,
I'd love to hunt with him.

2827
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:56,820
You know,
he's a guy I'd love to hunt with,

2828
02:13:56,970 --> 02:13:59,400
really enjoy his company.
Um,

2829
02:14:00,090 --> 02:14:03,390
but it,
I don't have like these fantasies of

2830
02:14:03,391 --> 02:14:04,224
big,
you know,

2831
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:06,930
big western or Alaskan hunts or
whatever.

2832
02:14:06,931 --> 02:14:10,480
And so you're hunting is almost like,
um,

2833
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:14,550
you're doing it almost entirely for
food,

2834
02:14:14,970 --> 02:14:17,070
you know?
Yes.

2835
02:14:17,071 --> 02:14:22,071
But if I just wanted food,
there are much more efficient ways to

2836
02:14:23,041 --> 02:14:24,870
produce that.
I could raise chickens,

2837
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:26,303
right?
Sure.

2838
02:14:26,730 --> 02:14:27,900
It's a guaranteed thing.

2839
02:14:28,270 --> 02:14:29,460
You,
unless the,

2840
02:14:29,461 --> 02:14:31,950
they get taken out by predators or
disease or something.

2841
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:34,710
You,
you raised these chickens and then you

2842
02:14:34,711 --> 02:14:38,400
have meat or you raise chickens and have
eggs or so on.

2843
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:43,900
Um,
so the prime motive for me to hunt as

2844
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:49,320
the prime motive for humans to hunt when
it started,

2845
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:52,650
you know,
way back is food.

2846
02:14:53,170 --> 02:14:58,170
And that's essentially why I hunt.
But there's often been this split that's

2847
02:15:00,541 --> 02:15:05,541
been drawn between this distinction
drawn between hunting for utility,

2848
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:11,230
utilitarian food and hunting because you
enjoyed a hoe,

2849
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:13,020
you enjoy hunting,
you know,

2850
02:15:13,021 --> 02:15:14,970
what do you call that?
Sport hunting or recreational hunting or

2851
02:15:14,971 --> 02:15:17,460
whatever you call it.
And

2852
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:23,070
the problem with that is that one,
for most of us,

2853
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:25,200
they're not separate.
I mean,

2854
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:29,670
you hunt because you enjoy something
about hunting and it's meaningful to you

2855
02:15:29,850 --> 02:15:33,000
and the food is meaningful and you get
food from it.

2856
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:38,240
That's why I hunt both of those reasons.
Traditional subsistence hunting

2857
02:15:39,601 --> 02:15:40,434
cultures,

2858
02:15:42,110 --> 02:15:43,910
those people love to hunt.
Yeah.

2859
02:15:43,970 --> 02:15:45,950
They also totally depend on the food.
Yeah.

2860
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:47,870
So both,
it's both,

2861
02:15:47,900 --> 02:15:49,940
you know,
it's not really a separate thing.

2862
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:54,740
I don't think it probably really ever
has been for any hunting culture.

2863
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:57,920
Um,
so more fishing or fishing.

2864
02:15:57,921 --> 02:15:59,000
Exactly.
Right.

2865
02:15:59,001 --> 02:16:00,850
So it's for both.
Yeah.

2866
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,450
Uh,
it's enjoyable.

2867
02:16:02,510 --> 02:16:03,510
And there,
you know,

2868
02:16:03,860 --> 02:16:06,060
if it wasn't enjoyable,
you know,

2869
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:09,470
we'd probably find other ways to,
we wouldn't do it.

2870
02:16:09,530 --> 02:16:13,130
And that's probably why it's enjoyable
because it provides food.

2871
02:16:13,190 --> 02:16:16,070
I mean it stimulates these areas that
we're talking about,

2872
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:18,920
these primal need areas,
right?

2873
02:16:18,950 --> 02:16:23,600
So yes,
food is my primary sort of motive in

2874
02:16:23,601 --> 02:16:25,940
terms of a,
a product materially,

2875
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:29,560
materially food is my motive.
It's not to have a big of antlers on the

2876
02:16:29,561 --> 02:16:32,560
wall.
If I end up with a big set of antlers,

2877
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:35,290
I'll probably keep that skull and
antlers like you do.

2878
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:37,540
But it's not the point,
right?

2879
02:16:37,810 --> 02:16:41,110
But it's the experience of it.
And as I got into it more,

2880
02:16:41,170 --> 02:16:46,170
as I started to have more relationships
with other people that I really

2881
02:16:46,331 --> 02:16:51,331
respected and who also hunted,
then it's also part of that if I'm

2882
02:16:52,391 --> 02:16:55,720
hunting with someone,
you know that I really enjoy their

2883
02:16:55,721 --> 02:16:58,990
company.
So there's social and you know,

2884
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:03,310
natural experience motives that are very
much just about the process and the

2885
02:17:03,311 --> 02:17:05,350
experience.
And then there's the food,

2886
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:08,020
but they're all,
they're all interwoven.

2887
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:10,300
Yeah.
I think there's some people that want

2888
02:17:10,301 --> 02:17:12,490
you to feel bad about it.
So they don't want,

2889
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:15,070
they don't want you to be enjoying it.
Sure.

2890
02:17:15,071 --> 02:17:18,430
And if it was,
I sadistically enjoyed killing.

2891
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:21,250
Right.
I would find that disturbing.

2892
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:24,370
Yes.
And I do find that disturbing when I see

2893
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:28,750
people talking about or acting about
hunting or anything else.

2894
02:17:28,751 --> 02:17:33,751
That way I don't care whether it's a cat
or a dog or a wild deer or to

2895
02:17:34,001 --> 02:17:37,810
sadistically enjoy
causing pain and,

2896
02:17:37,811 --> 02:17:40,600
or taking life that's,
that's problematic.

2897
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:43,990
Which is one of the reasons why,
that's the number one accusation that

2898
02:17:43,991 --> 02:17:46,420
anti hunters will label on hunters.
It's,

2899
02:17:46,421 --> 02:17:48,550
you're a sadistic person you enjoy
doing.

2900
02:17:48,551 --> 02:17:50,410
This is the only reason why he possibly
do this

2901
02:17:50,470 --> 02:17:52,570
and when.
But when you say you enjoy hunting,

2902
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:58,320
if the understanding is what you enjoy
is simply that moment of taking life,

2903
02:17:59,081 --> 02:18:02,620
there's nothing else about it that you
enjoy and what the way you enjoy that

2904
02:18:02,621 --> 02:18:04,920
moment is sadistic.
Right.

2905
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:10,230
Not the kind of light bulb goes off in
some part of this ancient,

2906
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:12,910
you know,
human mind that

2907
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:17,080
that's a different kind of in this
altered state.

2908
02:18:18,250 --> 02:18:20,830
Some people might describe that as
exciting or pleasurable,

2909
02:18:20,831 --> 02:18:24,520
I guess.
It's not like a,

2910
02:18:24,521 --> 02:18:29,050
as you said,
it's not for you a lust to kill.

2911
02:18:29,380 --> 02:18:30,610
No,
it's not that.

2912
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:33,760
But there's something that is magnetic
and powerful about it.

2913
02:18:34,130 --> 02:18:36,110
Yeah,
there's something insanely primal about

2914
02:18:36,111 --> 02:18:38,780
it,
but one of the weirder things that

2915
02:18:39,860 --> 02:18:42,050
people lobby at you,
um,

2916
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:45,200
that the people,
the insults that they send your way.

2917
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:48,680
One of the big ones is you can't get an
erection,

2918
02:18:48,681 --> 02:18:51,890
so you go kill animals or you have a
little penis,

2919
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:56,630
so you kill animals like it,
it gets brought to this weird sexual

2920
02:18:56,631 --> 02:18:58,160
lust thing.
That's I,

2921
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:00,740
I'm really confused about.
I always get confused.

2922
02:19:00,741 --> 02:19:03,710
Like what is the root of that?
Because so many people go to that one,

2923
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:06,020
like they go to that one.
When I,

2924
02:19:06,021 --> 02:19:09,800
whenever I watched even no matter who
the hunter is that people are attacking,

2925
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:13,970
like whether it was the Walter,
the the dentist guy who killed Cecil or

2926
02:19:13,971 --> 02:19:16,870
whatever.
It's so many of them go to that,

2927
02:19:17,050 --> 02:19:20,270
that it's,
this person is sexually inadequate so

2928
02:19:20,271 --> 02:19:23,720
they're going out and killing animals.
There's this bizarre connection.

2929
02:19:23,721 --> 02:19:26,840
I don't understand that one.
And now maybe we should just blame Freud

2930
02:19:26,841 --> 02:19:27,674
for,
I don't know.

2931
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:30,020
I mean maybe,
right.

2932
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:33,020
I mean,
part of it is we have a tendency to,

2933
02:19:33,890 --> 02:19:37,140
to in our society and culture maybe
since Freud to,

2934
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:41,250
to link any kind of like aberrant
behavior or,

2935
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,320
or motive or desire with sex.
Yeah.

2936
02:19:43,490 --> 02:19:45,480
Which is crazy.
Um,

2937
02:19:46,670 --> 02:19:51,530
but there's also been a longstanding
story that's been told,

2938
02:19:51,670 --> 02:19:53,240
uh,
by critics of,

2939
02:19:53,241 --> 02:19:55,160
of hunting,
um,

2940
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:57,980
that,
you know,

2941
02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:03,040
violence toward animals through hunting
is the same as sort of sexual violence

2942
02:20:06,290 --> 02:20:09,440
toward women.
And that women like mother Earth did

2943
02:20:09,450 --> 02:20:14,150
associates between women in Earth and
nature and men are these dominating,

2944
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:17,270
domineering Thailand,
macho,

2945
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:18,200
evil,
right.

2946
02:20:18,470 --> 02:20:20,120
And,
and there's a,

2947
02:20:20,630 --> 02:20:24,920
you can sort of see the logic and the
sort of cultural roots of all of that.

2948
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:28,010
Um,
part of the problem.

2949
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:32,840
And then Mary Mary Stage wrote this
fascinating book called woman the

2950
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:34,130
Hunter,
um,

2951
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:36,450
back 25 years ago.
Uh,

2952
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:40,610
and part of her argument,
she's very much a feminist,

2953
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:41,780
you know,
and,

2954
02:20:41,781 --> 02:20:43,370
and,
and a hunter.

2955
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,840
Uh,
and part of her rebuttal to that

2956
02:20:48,590 --> 02:20:53,590
parallel around sexuality is that
the same story is told both by the sort

2957
02:21:00,741 --> 02:21:05,741
of mainstream culture that portrays men
as domineering and women as nurturing.

2958
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:15,530
And you know,
men is as violators and women as

2959
02:21:15,531 --> 02:21:16,370
victims,
you know,

2960
02:21:16,371 --> 02:21:19,880
which has happened certainly
historically that relationship exists,

2961
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:20,450
right?
Right.

2962
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:25,430
But the parallel to to nature,
um,

2963
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:28,580
as ma'am the hunter as a cultural myth
myth,

2964
02:21:28,581 --> 02:21:33,581
which is very strong in,
in our culture that the critics I sort

2965
02:21:36,111 --> 02:21:39,980
of ecological feminists and so on,
the critics of that are retelling the

2966
02:21:39,981 --> 02:21:44,981
same story.
It's men play this role and women are

2967
02:21:45,951 --> 02:21:48,890
inherently nurturing,
inherently

2968
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:54,800
not the sort of sexual violent,
you know,

2969
02:21:55,790 --> 02:21:58,190
lust driven,
sort of male.

2970
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:02,390
Uh,
and her argument is,

2971
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:08,080
let's break this down.
Let's also have women as hunters being

2972
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:15,670
honored and respected and accept that
strong women and hunting

2973
02:22:18,850 --> 02:22:19,590
okay

2974
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:22,860
can be compatible.
And women are not inherently

2975
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:25,883
nurturing,

2976
02:22:26,020 --> 02:22:28,200
always.
They can be life takers,

2977
02:22:28,201 --> 02:22:29,760
they can be hunters,
you know,

2978
02:22:29,761 --> 02:22:32,400
they can provide for their family
through,

2979
02:22:32,730 --> 02:22:36,330
through taking life.
And hunting does not have to be

2980
02:22:36,331 --> 02:22:39,840
motivated and isn't motivated for most
hunters.

2981
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:42,300
By some bizarre,
twisted sexual thing.

2982
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:43,110
Yeah.
You know,

2983
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:46,880
whether it's women or men,
that's not what the real experience for

2984
02:22:46,881 --> 02:22:48,600
me really.
Meaning I think there's just,

2985
02:22:48,740 --> 02:22:51,900
it's just a simple,
goto criticism.

2986
02:22:51,901 --> 02:22:55,050
They like to latch onto it.
I don't think if you,

2987
02:22:55,051 --> 02:22:57,000
if you gave them,
uh,

2988
02:22:57,001 --> 02:23:00,060
a quiet room and said,
okay,

2989
02:23:00,061 --> 02:23:03,300
why do you think people hunt if you,
if you wanted to,

2990
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:05,760
if you're correct,
you're gonna win $1 million.

2991
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:10,790
So I want you to really do your best to
try to calculate and formulate their,

2992
02:23:11,070 --> 02:23:14,190
the actual process that's going on in a
person's brain when they're hunting an

2993
02:23:14,191 --> 02:23:16,680
animal.
[inaudible] either guarantee you they're

2994
02:23:16,681 --> 02:23:18,270
not going to go with,
get it up there.

2995
02:23:18,271 --> 02:23:20,190
Not because then they want to get that
million bucks.

2996
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:22,170
They would,
they would try to figure it out and they

2997
02:23:22,171 --> 02:23:24,010
would try to be objective about it.
It's a,

2998
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:26,010
it's,
it's a cheap go to insult.

2999
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:27,060
You know,
I think,

3000
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:32,100
I think it is,
and I think that when it's something

3001
02:23:32,101 --> 02:23:35,580
that's when people here

3002
02:23:37,430 --> 02:23:40,880
a hunter talk about the experience of
hunting,

3003
02:23:41,060 --> 02:23:46,010
the way you're talking about it and what
that food means and what that moment is

3004
02:23:46,011 --> 02:23:51,011
like when they hear that,
they respect that in general,

3005
02:23:52,010 --> 02:23:52,843
you know?
Right.

3006
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:56,040
Most non hunters who do,
I have no experience as long as they

3007
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:57,550
meet.
Most likely though,

3008
02:23:57,650 --> 02:23:59,320
even even some vegetarians,
I mean,

3009
02:23:59,350 --> 02:24:00,650
right.
And some of the attorneys,

3010
02:24:00,651 --> 02:24:02,150
we'll make exceptions for meat that's
been hunted.

3011
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:03,613
Right?
I mean,

3012
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:10,180
they can really respect that in general.
It's when there's no experience of

3013
02:24:12,831 --> 02:24:16,850
someone speaking about it that way.
And it's just some picture of some guy

3014
02:24:16,851 --> 02:24:18,380
with some zebra or,
yeah.

3015
02:24:18,660 --> 02:24:21,050
Yeah.
It's so in comprehensible.

3016
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:22,790
Yeah.
It's so removed and then there's

3017
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:23,713
no,

3018
02:24:25,690 --> 02:24:28,420
there's no story that can be understood.
Right.

3019
02:24:28,510 --> 02:24:33,510
So it's kind of,
I get having been a Vegan and having had

3020
02:24:35,111 --> 02:24:37,900
a pretty dim view of hunting myself for
a long time,

3021
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:41,530
um,
and having,

3022
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:44,710
having had very strong feelings and
still having very strong feelings about,

3023
02:24:45,070 --> 02:24:49,450
about animals.
I get where that hostility and outrage

3024
02:24:49,451 --> 02:24:50,740
comes from.
You know?

3025
02:24:50,950 --> 02:24:55,950
Right.
And I can understand why someone would

3026
02:24:56,441 --> 02:24:58,120
even come up with that sort of bizarre
theory.

3027
02:24:58,690 --> 02:25:01,120
Yeah,
I can as well a lot of ways.

3028
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:04,360
Um,
w w w without again,

3029
02:25:04,390 --> 02:25:07,910
like if I wanted to win $1 million,
they left me alone in a room and I'd

3030
02:25:07,930 --> 02:25:09,670
never had it before.
And if I wanted to come up with a mode

3031
02:25:09,671 --> 02:25:11,070
of that wouldn't be on the list,
right.

3032
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:14,860
Because I don't really believe it.
I don't think anybody else does either.

3033
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:18,310
But before I first haunted,
I was thinking to myself,

3034
02:25:18,311 --> 02:25:21,370
I'm going to either going to become a
Vegan or I'm going to become a hunter.

3035
02:25:21,580 --> 02:25:24,310
That was what this,
when I first went hunting,

3036
02:25:24,311 --> 02:25:24,911
I was saying,
well,

3037
02:25:24,911 --> 02:25:26,680
one of the things can happen either when
to shoot this animal.

3038
02:25:26,681 --> 02:25:28,960
I'm going to be horrified with myself.
I'm going to be like,

3039
02:25:28,990 --> 02:25:32,350
I'm going to eat this animal and then
I'm done or I'm going to become a

3040
02:25:32,351 --> 02:25:33,950
hunter.
Um,

3041
02:25:34,210 --> 02:25:38,260
I just,
I feel like this is one of those things

3042
02:25:38,261 --> 02:25:41,930
that will not be solved.
This is one of those things that the,

3043
02:25:41,931 --> 02:25:45,040
the debate will continue to rage on.
And I see both sides.

3044
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:49,390
I,
I absolutely see and admire the motive

3045
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:54,220
that the ethical vegans want or are
attempting to pursue.

3046
02:25:54,690 --> 02:25:58,390
Um,
I also see the intense hypocrisy when I

3047
02:25:58,391 --> 02:26:00,460
find out they have cats.
You know,

3048
02:26:00,490 --> 02:26:02,200
I mean it's,
it's super common,

3049
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:03,640
you know,
and amongst my friends,

3050
02:26:03,641 --> 02:26:05,590
I have a good French wages to the comedy
store.

3051
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:07,780
She's got a bunch of fucking cats and
she's a Vegan.

3052
02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:09,760
She gives people a hard time about meat,
like pitch,

3053
02:26:09,761 --> 02:26:12,100
you're feeding your monsters and
vampires.

3054
02:26:12,101 --> 02:26:15,700
You live with you bringing them home
dead things and they're probably

3055
02:26:15,701 --> 02:26:18,130
bringing her home dead things to figure
it out probably if they get out.

3056
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:19,480
Yeah.
Um,

3057
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:22,420
I just think that the,
this is,

3058
02:26:22,421 --> 02:26:25,600
uh,
this is sort of a stage,

3059
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:29,350
um,
that human civilization is going

3060
02:26:29,351 --> 02:26:32,290
through,
that's going to take a few hundred years

3061
02:26:32,650 --> 02:26:37,650
and in that few hundred years or so,
we're going to evolve to be something

3062
02:26:37,691 --> 02:26:42,610
that's almost unrecognizable to,
in comparison to what we are now and

3063
02:26:42,611 --> 02:26:46,510
that we're going through this process
and in this process where longing or

3064
02:26:46,511 --> 02:26:49,630
longing towards the idea of wearing a
flannel shirt and going into the woods

3065
02:26:49,631 --> 02:26:51,130
with a bow and Arrow,
you know,

3066
02:26:51,131 --> 02:26:54,340
like that's what grandpa did know.
GRANDPA seemed happy all the time.

3067
02:26:54,820 --> 02:26:56,410
Oh,
grandpa didn't even have an email,

3068
02:26:56,580 --> 02:26:58,390
you know,
and he was happier for it.

3069
02:26:59,830 --> 02:27:01,090
He might've been,
you know,

3070
02:27:01,091 --> 02:27:02,260
I don't know.
I don't know.

3071
02:27:02,261 --> 02:27:03,094
I don't,
you know,

3072
02:27:03,490 --> 02:27:05,440
is,
is there anything that's been surprising

3073
02:27:05,470 --> 02:27:09,010
about this process and,
and creating this book and all this

3074
02:27:09,011 --> 02:27:10,390
stuff,
you know,

3075
02:27:10,810 --> 02:27:15,610
it goes back in a way where this
conversation started because you asked,

3076
02:27:15,611 --> 02:27:16,990
you know,
how much grief did you get?

3077
02:27:16,991 --> 02:27:21,991
How much flack did you take?
And what's been most surprising in a way

3078
02:27:22,751 --> 02:27:24,220
and,
and most rewarding,

3079
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:26,020
uh,
is,

3080
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:27,613
hmm.

3081
02:27:27,690 --> 02:27:32,690
That I've had opportunities to talk with
such a wide range of people and I've

3082
02:27:33,601 --> 02:27:38,130
done
seminars for a hunter education

3083
02:27:38,131 --> 02:27:43,131
instructors and I've talked to you know,
rooms full of non hunters,

3084
02:27:43,951 --> 02:27:48,951
including some vegetarians.
And the conversations have been

3085
02:27:49,771 --> 02:27:54,771
remarkably
respectful and civil across those

3086
02:27:55,011 --> 02:27:59,240
different and signs in the same room
size is a mix of those people in the

3087
02:27:59,241 --> 02:28:00,900
same room.
Um,

3088
02:28:02,270 --> 02:28:03,620
I went,
um,

3089
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:07,730
very similar to this sort of experience
you're talking about with what it felt

3090
02:28:07,731 --> 02:28:09,560
like to hunt and,
and actually take an animal.

3091
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:13,530
I went out to Colorado,
um,

3092
02:28:13,670 --> 02:28:17,000
two,
three years ago and did some seminars

3093
02:28:17,001 --> 02:28:21,260
for hundreds Keisha instructors and I
was a little uncomfortable because of

3094
02:28:21,261 --> 02:28:22,010
the topics they

3095
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:24,640
asked me to speak on was,
uh,

3096
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:26,180
ethics.
And I thought,

3097
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:27,380
I'm a new hunter.
I mean,

3098
02:28:27,381 --> 02:28:29,870
I just started a few years ago and
here's all these lifelong hunter is

3099
02:28:29,871 --> 02:28:31,760
pretty much in this room.
75 guys,

3100
02:28:31,761 --> 02:28:34,790
mostly guys.
And I'm going to tell them about hunting

3101
02:28:34,791 --> 02:28:36,040
ethics.
Like,

3102
02:28:36,050 --> 02:28:37,820
oh my God,
how am I going to preach to them?

3103
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:39,190
Right?
Uh,

3104
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:43,250
but it went well.
And as soon as I opened it up for q and

3105
02:28:43,251 --> 02:28:47,960
a and we got into discussion,
these guys are talking really deeply

3106
02:28:47,961 --> 02:28:52,490
about the experience of taking life and
the sort of emotional dimensions of that

3107
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:56,960
and they're talking to each other and
challenging each other to bring that

3108
02:28:56,961 --> 02:28:59,030
into the classroom with their students.
I was like,

3109
02:28:59,031 --> 02:28:59,864
wow.

3110
02:29:01,350 --> 02:29:05,820
Two days later I was just outside
boulder and I'm sure you know boulder

3111
02:29:06,870 --> 02:29:10,800
boulder's the button of every joke in
Colorado and vice versa,

3112
02:29:10,830 --> 02:29:12,690
you know soapies exactly.
You know,

3113
02:29:12,691 --> 02:29:13,770
so they say,
you know,

3114
02:29:14,070 --> 02:29:14,903
all the,
the,

3115
02:29:14,970 --> 02:29:17,610
all these hundred education instructors
were actually joking about boulder.

3116
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:19,230
We were,
we were up in the mountains at this

3117
02:29:19,650 --> 02:29:21,090
place,
but they were joking about boulder and

3118
02:29:21,091 --> 02:29:21,451
they said,
you know,

3119
02:29:21,451 --> 02:29:22,390
how do you get to boulder?
Well,

3120
02:29:22,391 --> 02:29:24,840
you go to the edge of reality and you
turn left

3121
02:29:28,020 --> 02:29:29,640
and it's always laugh.
The joke is always,

3122
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:31,140
of course,
yeah.

3123
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:33,750
I'm probably one of the most liberal
places on earth.

3124
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:34,613
Right?
Yeah.

3125
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:38,880
And of course boulder,
that stereotype of boulder is telling

3126
02:29:38,881 --> 02:29:43,350
the same jokes are different jokes,
but jokes in return about evergreen.

3127
02:29:43,650 --> 02:29:44,251
Well,
yeah.

3128
02:29:44,251 --> 02:29:44,671
Well,
no,

3129
02:29:44,671 --> 02:29:47,220
I mean about the rednecks.
Yes.

3130
02:29:47,221 --> 02:29:48,150
And the hunters.
Yeah.

3131
02:29:48,151 --> 02:29:49,980
Yeah.
And you know these,

3132
02:29:49,981 --> 02:29:52,320
you know all these hunting jokes and
redneck jokes.

3133
02:29:53,970 --> 02:29:57,930
I was in boulder because I was being
interviewed by this x vegetarian who ran

3134
02:29:57,931 --> 02:30:02,880
this a show for Gaiam TV,
this online TV station.

3135
02:30:03,210 --> 02:30:05,730
It's all eastern spirituality and you
know,

3136
02:30:05,850 --> 02:30:06,683
all that kind of thing.

3137
02:30:08,260 --> 02:30:08,740
Okay.

3138
02:30:08,740 --> 02:30:10,120
Exactly.
The people who would make fun of each

3139
02:30:10,121 --> 02:30:10,954
other.
Right.

3140
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:13,540
A hundred education instructors and guy
MTV.

3141
02:30:14,830 --> 02:30:16,870
As soon as we got into the conversation.

3142
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:18,320
Yeah.

3143
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:22,010
We're talking about the emotional and
ethical dimensions of taking life.

3144
02:30:22,011 --> 02:30:24,410
She's an ex vegetarian.
She's now eating meat,

3145
02:30:24,411 --> 02:30:27,050
but she's not a hunter or she's thinking
about these issues about confronting

3146
02:30:27,051 --> 02:30:29,570
life and death,
and when I got done the trip,

3147
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:30,411
I looked back,
I was like,

3148
02:30:30,411 --> 02:30:31,244
wow.

3149
02:30:31,870 --> 02:30:32,270
Okay.

3150
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:34,580
Those two conversations were really
similar,

3151
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:38,450
complete different communities who
normally would think they had nothing in

3152
02:30:38,451 --> 02:30:41,780
common,
especially around hunting and yet the

3153
02:30:41,781 --> 02:30:45,170
very basic human questions,
the basic moral,

3154
02:30:45,380 --> 02:30:48,440
ethical,
emotional issues around taking another

3155
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:50,900
creature's life,
especially a big,

3156
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:56,290
big mammal.
It was a similar conversation and so

3157
02:30:56,610 --> 02:30:58,890
that's been,
I guess in a way,

3158
02:30:58,891 --> 02:31:02,820
one of the most rewarding and surprising
things about about the whole process and

3159
02:31:02,821 --> 02:31:07,821
the and the journey since is that you
get to see and talk with people in these

3160
02:31:08,971 --> 02:31:11,580
places where you know there's common
ground.

3161
02:31:11,820 --> 02:31:13,560
Yeah.
In different cultures,

3162
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:15,830
you know,
radically different communities demar

3163
02:31:15,870 --> 02:31:18,630
there most certainly is.
And one of the things that I'm hoping is

3164
02:31:18,631 --> 02:31:20,190
going to common ground

3165
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:24,840
or bring some common ground or at least
bring an understanding is the emerging

3166
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:29,730
science behind understanding the
intelligence of plants and that plants

3167
02:31:29,731 --> 02:31:34,410
are in fact a life form that we take for
granted because they're not in motion

3168
02:31:34,620 --> 02:31:38,000
because they're stationary w and they
slowly grow and we were,

3169
02:31:38,001 --> 02:31:39,060
we don't really,
you know,

3170
02:31:39,330 --> 02:31:42,720
we don't really associate them with
being a life form,

3171
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:46,050
but they are a life form and they're
strange life form that has some form of

3172
02:31:46,051 --> 02:31:48,450
communication.
Some of them can make calculations,

3173
02:31:48,690 --> 02:31:51,240
some of them in fact rare,
but they exist.

3174
02:31:51,241 --> 02:31:55,230
They're carnivorous there.
It's a strange type of life.

3175
02:31:55,650 --> 02:32:00,650
And as we grow to understand that life
deeper and deeper and have more respect

3176
02:32:02,761 --> 02:32:07,560
for it and really understand what it,
what exactly they're doing when they're

3177
02:32:07,561 --> 02:32:09,660
making calculations,
what exactly they're doing.

3178
02:32:09,661 --> 02:32:13,020
The communicating with each other,
how this network of,

3179
02:32:13,050 --> 02:32:15,660
uh,
intertwined lifeforms,

3180
02:32:15,740 --> 02:32:19,030
similar plant life forms that exists in
this topsoil,

3181
02:32:19,170 --> 02:32:24,060
which is also some sort of a very
bizarre ecosystem of life that these

3182
02:32:24,061 --> 02:32:27,750
electrical impulses that they're sharing
with each other or some sort of form of

3183
02:32:27,751 --> 02:32:31,540
communication and,
and Miss Holst traditions.

3184
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:33,990
Yeah.
The spiritual dimension is not going to

3185
02:32:33,991 --> 02:32:35,060
be animals,
but plants do.

3186
02:32:35,110 --> 02:32:38,720
Yes.
And that this is the,

3187
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:43,940
this is an unshakable,
undeniable truth that life eats life.

3188
02:32:45,690 --> 02:32:46,740
And we are,
and we,

3189
02:32:46,741 --> 02:32:49,170
and every animal on the planet is
utterly dependent on plants.

3190
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:50,033
Yes.
Yeah.

3191
02:32:50,310 --> 02:32:51,930
All of them.
None of us are none of us that are

3192
02:32:51,931 --> 02:32:53,490
photosynthesizing.
Yeah.

3193
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:55,800
You know,
I don't know if there's any way ever to

3194
02:32:55,801 --> 02:33:00,801
get away from what we've established in
this country with a giant numbers of

3195
02:33:00,961 --> 02:33:04,140
human beings and these population
centers and the factory farms.

3196
02:33:04,141 --> 02:33:07,770
It's support these population centers.
I don't know what the way of getting

3197
02:33:07,771 --> 02:33:11,940
around that is,
but I do think that people like yourself

3198
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:14,940
and uh,
other people that are proponents of

3199
02:33:15,310 --> 02:33:20,310
least removing your own existence from
it in as clear a way as possible by

3200
02:33:22,860 --> 02:33:26,700
doing some growing and gardening by
doing some hunting,

3201
02:33:26,701 --> 02:33:31,701
by experiencing the wild of this world
and going out there and getting into it

3202
02:33:32,251 --> 02:33:37,251
and understanding of this is this is,
this is a real environment that coexists

3203
02:33:37,410 --> 02:33:42,410
with the city during the same timeframe
on earth and you,

3204
02:33:43,050 --> 02:33:44,040
we all,
I think,

3205
02:33:44,041 --> 02:33:47,250
I don't think as a person that looks at
those factory farm videos and goes,

3206
02:33:47,251 --> 02:33:48,360
oh yeah,
awesome.

3207
02:33:48,440 --> 02:33:49,860
Fuck those calves.
Yeah,

3208
02:33:50,130 --> 02:33:52,320
I'm glad those chickens get stuff to
those boxes,

3209
02:33:52,321 --> 02:33:55,110
I don't think is a single person that
does that.

3210
02:33:55,111 --> 02:33:58,530
And I think that's also why those ag gag
laws are in effect to protect those

3211
02:33:58,531 --> 02:34:00,840
businesses.
Because if that stuff gets out,

3212
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:04,590
people get horrified and then they vote
with their dollar and they,

3213
02:34:04,610 --> 02:34:08,700
they make choices that reflect the
horror that they experience when they're

3214
02:34:08,701 --> 02:34:09,950
watching those videos.
Sure.

3215
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:10,861
Yeah.
I don't,

3216
02:34:10,861 --> 02:34:14,040
I don't know if we can all collectively
as a group get out of this,

3217
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:18,130
but I think as individuals we can start
moving away from it.

3218
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:21,890
You know,
I think what you're doing when you were

3219
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:24,130
or what your friends are doing when
you're talking about these people that

3220
02:34:24,131 --> 02:34:25,850
used to be vegetarians and now they're
the grid,

3221
02:34:25,851 --> 02:34:28,840
their on chickens now they provide food
to these other people.

3222
02:34:28,841 --> 02:34:30,280
Like that's ideal.

3223
02:34:30,310 --> 02:34:32,870
You know,
finding the people that are involved in,

3224
02:34:33,070 --> 02:34:37,000
in growing and butchering this meat and
getting it from them.

3225
02:34:37,390 --> 02:34:40,900
Like it's a cleaner,
easier way of,

3226
02:34:40,901 --> 02:34:44,680
of existing [inaudible] I don't,
um,

3227
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:47,560
I don't,
I don't know if we're ever though with

3228
02:34:47,561 --> 02:34:49,270
the,
the amount of people that we have

3229
02:34:49,271 --> 02:34:51,730
stuffed in the cities.
How else,

3230
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:52,361
Eh,
my people,

3231
02:34:52,361 --> 02:34:54,090
we have stuff on the globe.
Yeah.

3232
02:34:54,190 --> 02:34:56,980
That's insane.
How else are we going to get them fed?

3233
02:34:57,790 --> 02:34:59,920
We fucked up.
Yeah.

3234
02:34:59,921 --> 02:35:02,870
If you were to that objective being
hovered bugs they,

3235
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:03,850
wow.
What a mess.

3236
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:07,020
Yeah.
It's almost like,

3237
02:35:07,030 --> 02:35:08,680
um,
uh,

3238
02:35:09,080 --> 02:35:13,020
an insurmountable student debt.
Like what did you,

3239
02:35:13,030 --> 02:35:15,550
you're not going to pay this off.
How are you going to pay this?

3240
02:35:15,990 --> 02:35:18,730
What did you do?
You can't feed all those people the real

3241
02:35:18,731 --> 02:35:20,080
way,
you know,

3242
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:22,150
Oh,
you've got to keep stuffing chickens

3243
02:35:22,151 --> 02:35:26,470
into factories and then you've got to
keep stuffing these pigs into warehouses

3244
02:35:26,471 --> 02:35:29,110
and then,
or,

3245
02:35:29,890 --> 02:35:32,440
or something.
I don't know what that something is.

3246
02:35:32,470 --> 02:35:34,090
You know,
I don't know what the other alternative

3247
02:35:34,091 --> 02:35:34,924
is,
you know,

3248
02:35:35,140 --> 02:35:36,460
I dunno.
Um,

3249
02:35:36,490 --> 02:35:40,450
anything else before we wrap this sucker
up and how it's been great fun.

3250
02:35:40,480 --> 02:35:41,560
Thanks for doing it.
It's a really pretty,

3251
02:35:41,561 --> 02:35:43,040
my pleasure.
Um,

3252
02:35:43,430 --> 02:35:46,540
Tovar.
His book is the mindful carnivores and

3253
02:35:46,541 --> 02:35:49,330
it is available everywhere.
It's on Amazon,

3254
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:53,320
printed by Pegasus books and a tow bars
are really,

3255
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:55,300
thanks sir.
I appreciate it,

3256
02:35:55,301 --> 02:35:56,134
man.
