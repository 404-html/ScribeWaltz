1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,010
Ladies and Gentlemen,
day 27.

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,540
Is that what it is,
Brian?

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,410
Uh,
yeah.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,640
Week 27 or podcast 27,
right?

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,840
We did two in a week once.
That was a crazy week.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome once again to the a weekly 

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,910
Ustream podcast really has been fucking 
weekly man.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,290
I say it's 29.
We're waiting.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,990
We're waiting.
Late podcast 29.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,030
It's amazing that we kept kept with it 
for this long and it's also amazing that

11
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,350
I never did anything like this before.
It is,

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,560
you know,
it takes me so long to get into a groove

13
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:42,561
with anything.
It took me so long to accept like email 

14
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:44,910
lists and my space and all that shit.
Like for the longest time I was like,

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,400
I don't want to get involved in 
promoting myself.

16
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:48,480
Fuck that,
you know,

17
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:53,481
fuck advertising shells.
Just get on the radio and just do it 

18
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:53,481
like normal.

19
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:57,380
But then you see all these other dudes 
that are doing it that way and they're 

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,380
doing so well with it.
What happened to your shit?

21
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,300
I think my space is the first one that 
actually went crazy like that made you 

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,600
realize the power of the Internet.
Like fleshlight.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,830
Yeah.
Well the,

24
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,831
my space days,
that was the comedy store days and we 

25
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:10,340
were using the uh,
when we were using the mice brains,

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,620
fucking comedy store was sold out like 
every weekend and it was just because of

27
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:16,380
my space,
which didn't know before then man,

28
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:21,381
you could never have the,
they would have to drive by and just 

29
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:21,990
know that you're there because of the 
billboard or just know that you're there

30
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:23,810
because of word of mouth,
but you know,

31
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,850
we could throw it up on my space and it 
was nothing now or a school yard of 

32
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:28,850
paper.

33
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,360
Boys going,
my space is a fucking dinosaur.

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:33,960
You know,
why?

35
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,900
Because my space didn't adapt.
I logged in last night,

36
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,290
first time and I think like two months 
check went through three or four pages 

37
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,371
of people that were fake.
People asking me to talk and stuff like 

38
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:46,371
that.
One new person going,

39
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:47,730
hey dude,
here's my facebook page.

40
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:52,470
Add me every now and then I'll go and 
read a little bit of the fan mail,

41
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,990
but it's just not worth it.
It's just a,

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,170
it's a graveyard.
It's like,

43
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,630
you know,
it's going to turn noble after the blast

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
and like talking to the people that are 
still there.

45
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,120
Like,
God,

46
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:00,990
man,
get Outta here.

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,740
Why did you here?
Using my space for Patton.

48
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:08,741
Oswald used my place still though.
There's this gentleman before we get 

49
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:11,811
going.
Her podcast is sponsored by the 

50
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:12,900
fleshlight I kinda show every week.
I don't know if that's like,

51
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,710
I feel like I at Barker's beauties,
I'm supposed to be demonstrating the 

52
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,710
product,
but uh,

53
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,430
it's what it is,
is basically a masturbation tool if you 

54
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,430
haven't used it for a.

55
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,780
We talk about it every week to fucking 
fantastic as far as beating off.

56
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,810
If you beat off and I know you do,
it's way better than just regular 

57
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,120
beating off.
So not that much money.

58
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:34,710
How much is money as across Brian?
It's like,

59
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,740
I don't know,
but you get 15 percent off your if you 

60
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:39,740
go on your way.
I don't know how much at all.

61
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:39,960
I think it's like $69.
Fifty $9.

62
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,750
Seventy $9.
I did your tip though,

63
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,010
uh,
this week and it's kind of,

64
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,030
of course a crazy thing happened.
Every time I do anything with a 

65
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,030
flashlight,
something crazy warm water thing.

66
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,300
No,
I put it outside and uh,

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,490
they let it heat up.
Of course,

68
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:58,491
my landlords often go out in the back to
smoke and then because they work above 

69
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,660
me and they see this rubber pussy out in
the sun,

70
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,160
they saw it out in the sun.

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,560
Oh my God.
Because when I went to pick it up,

72
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:10,561
they were sitting out there.
If you go to the fleshlight says this 

73
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:10,930
website contains explicit adult 
material.

74
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,170
What,
how crazy is it that you go to a website

75
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:19,171
that has rubber poseys and they have 
this crazy fucking warning you're about 

76
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:21,100
to see explicit adult material.
I mean,

77
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,500
do they have porn on their site?
Okay.

78
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:26,980
They have a guy and not even nudity.
Those girls have clothes on.

79
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,160
There was a guy in the girl in bed,
but the girl had a bra and panties on.

80
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,610
And uh,
if you're looking at all of these 

81
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:35,610
flashlights,
man,

82
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:35,610
it's like,
okay,

83
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,760
yeah,
it's rubber body part.

84
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,060
Is that really something you need to 
have a little warning click through.

85
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,250
You go to those sites,
receive violence,

86
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,570
you know,
you don't see shit like that,

87
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,590
but why can you just walk into a hustler
store without them stopping and telling 

88
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:48,590
you the same thing?

89
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,450
Something,
a lot of hustlers tours out there in the

90
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:51,640
world is there and their stories just 
like it,

91
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,390
like porn stores,
if that isn't one of those weird things 

92
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,390
when we go on the road and we see these,
uh,

93
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,990
these fucking towns like,
you know,

94
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,130
like if you go to like a,
what's a good example of that?

95
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,650
A bunch of them,
a Youngstown,

96
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,510
Ohio,
I was doing chosen Youngstown,

97
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:12,511
Ohio and it's like there's a bunch of 
those little sad 24 hour neon lit adult 

98
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:17,881
shops and that's just,
that's just people that's just like 

99
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:21,040
reluctant body maintenance,
like poor sad fucks.

100
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,130
And those places just wandering around,
looking depressed,

101
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,500
pushing those beads apart.
It's like,

102
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,290
why do they have to use beads?
Beads make fucking noise right?

103
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,440
When you push those beads apart and they
click and you go back into the dirty,

104
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,970
dirty area and see all the cock suck and
videos and shit.

105
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,910
I used to work at a video store that had
an adult room and it was open 24 hours a

106
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:44,911
day and it was kinda cool because he'd 
walk somebody to be walking up like a 

107
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:45,880
hot chick and you're like,
please let them go into the adult room,

108
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:47,530
you know,
of course they just walk up and go,

109
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,290
where's he at?
Designing women season two,

110
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:50,890
you know,
or something.

111
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,760
The craziest thing happened is an old 
teacher of mine,

112
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,850
first grade teacher went in there,
a woman and got porn and I could only 

113
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,240
hope it was for like a party.
Saw her.

114
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:01,900
Yeah,
she,

115
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,930
I waited on her.
She'd probably didn't recognize me 

116
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:06,930
because I'm,
you know,

117
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,750
I was like 20 and she was like,
uh,

118
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,710
you know,
older lady.

119
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,370
So this is your first grade teacher,
first grade teacher.

120
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,290
First grade is what?
Seven,

121
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,570
six,
six.

122
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,570
I don't know,
something like that.

123
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,380
And because I rang her up,
I also saw her last name was ms dot blah

124
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:21,160
blah blah.
And I'm like,

125
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:22,240
oh,
that's totally her.

126
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,950
Anyway,
she got the uh,

127
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:28,951
that's when I found out that a semester 
still alone did a porn called the 

128
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:29,890
Italian stallion and that's what she had
got.

129
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,710
So I don't think that was a real porn 
though.

130
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,350
I think it was one of those like 
showtime three in the morning,

131
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:36,100
porns.
Right.

132
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,830
So I think that I,
uh,

133
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,980
I thought like,
oh,

134
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:41,980
this is for a gag this for a party.
I accept this.

135
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,120
But see,
I could also see her whole history and 

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,120
it was like big black Dick Five,
you know,

137
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,511
it was only rented porn.
Sixty eight 70 maybe she was 70.

138
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,940
That pitches of freak.
That's crazy.

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,440
Just keeping it alive,
Huh?

140
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,070
Yeah.
Who.

141
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,140
So you don't think that Italian stallion
was a report?

142
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,290
I don't know.
I never watched it talking out of my 

143
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:05,290
ass,
but I'm pretty sure it wasn't.

144
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:05,630
I'm pretty sure it was like some fake 
3:00

145
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,290
in the morning.
Shit,

146
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,460
we had the porn side.
I saw a chick that I,

147
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,510
I used to date in one of those fake 3:00
in the morning porns where a dude is 

148
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,210
fake bone in her,
so I have to do,

149
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:17,060
it was just a little too low,
right?

150
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,940
Like she was like a pie a little too 
high and he was like,

151
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:22,820
you tell her their groin isn't really 
touching one of those,

152
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,280
you know,
and it was really freaky.

153
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,950
I was by myself and I slipped through 
the channels and it's like,

154
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:28,610
Whoa,
here's,

155
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,320
here's a person that,
you know,

156
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,960
I hadn't seen her in years is a long 
time ago.

157
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,130
So it was like I dated her over,
you know,

158
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,610
12 years ago,
13,

159
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,390
14 years ago.

160
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,370
Even.
So seeing her,

161
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:41,480
it was like,
wow,

162
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,600
this is kind of strange.
Like I'm watching some of that I used to

163
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:47,720
know and then they're fucking in a movie
even though it's not real,

164
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,670
you know?
What do you think is like,

165
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:54,671
if you like your high school sweetheart 
turns into like Sasha grey or something 

166
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:54,820
like that?
I could tell you what it's like,

167
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,010
I know what it's like.
I fucking,

168
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:56,780
it's weird,
man.

169
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,520
I don't even like thinking about it.
No,

170
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:58,850
no,
no,

171
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,400
no.
You don't know what it's like because in

172
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,390
your situation,
the person that,

173
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,510
if any person we're talking about is an 
actual real person,

174
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,560
right?
These are people that you met when you 

175
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:10,560
knew that they already did that thing.
Right.

176
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,920
It's a big thing to have a girl have it 
be your girlfriend.

177
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,040
This is my girl,
my check,

178
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,670
and then there's some freaking brute 
just doggy style on her and sweating and

179
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:20,770
spitting on her and shit.

180
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,490
You fucking bitch.
You like that?

181
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:23,210
And you're like,
Whoa,

182
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,880
that guy's fucking the shit out of my ex
girlfriend.

183
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,280
Yeah.
Especially real porn.

184
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,350
Yeah.
I have never found like old porn of like

185
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,010
a girl I've dated.
Have you ever done that?

186
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,920
Like you're going through their old 
photos and they go,

187
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,960
well,
I'm not a snoopy motherfuckers.

188
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,230
I mean,
have you ever done that?

189
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,120
Like were like they're going through 
photos,

190
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:44,300
like,
oh,

191
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,760
this is my old boyfriend.
Oh Dope.

192
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,450
You don't want to see this photo.
And then like,

193
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:52,451
no,
but I do always get sad when girls try 

194
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,610
to make me jealous like using.
I've always been sad like my whole life,

195
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:57,530
I've always thought that was one of the 
weakest things ever.

196
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,740
When someone you can tell,
the only reason why they're bringing 

197
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,250
this up or they're talking about the 
racks is to try to fuck with your head.

198
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,590
Like it never works.
All of that.

199
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:09,470
It makes you feel uncomfortable.
But the uncomfort that I feel is,

200
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,570
oh,
you're not as cool as I thought you 

201
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,570
were.
And Yeah,

202
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,430
now you're creepy and you're trying to 
fuck with me and okay,

203
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:21,431
can I talk you out of this?
Can I tell you that this is not 

204
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:21,431
necessary?
And we're just,

205
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:26,200
you know,
two people that are enjoying each 

206
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,200
other's company,
getting to know each other.

207
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,300
You know,
we don't have to play these stupid games

208
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:28,190
that we've already played in the past.
We should all learn,

209
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:33,191
right?
I played some stupid games and it was a 

210
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:33,191
little kid then I had to learn that 
they're dumb.

211
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,510
So when someone doesn't know the games 
like that are dumb,

212
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:37,640
like jealousy games from like fucking 
really,

213
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,560
you know,
come on man,

214
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,130
what am I fucking child?
Cut The shit so another guy fucked you.

215
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,010
You're crazy.
Get out of here.

216
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,720
I couldn't.
I can't believe it.

217
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,960
You're hot and you're 26 and another guy
is fucked you already.

218
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,210
Jesus Christ.
Was this recent?

219
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:58,211
Was this with the pitches probably 
sucking somebody's dick an hour before 

220
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:58,350
she picked you up.
You know,

221
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,410
she's fucking crazy.
It makes me wonder if that should ever 

222
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,081
go away because it doesn't seem like it 
is like my mom get in a fight with her 

223
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:07,950
boyfriend and you just do stupid shit 
like that goes away for sure.

224
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:10,380
It goes away and went with maturity.
Everything evolves.

225
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:15,381
It's the problem is when people get,
they go from one shit relationship to 

226
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:17,640
the next shit relationship and they 
never get traction as a human being.

227
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Never get traction and never realized.
And if you have shit friends on top of 

228
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:22,820
that,
which a lot of girls do,

229
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,970
man,
especially pretty girls,

230
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:24,730
a lot of pretty girls.

231
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,580
Their friends be hating.
You know?

232
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,400
It's tough man because for them it's 
like you're out with a pretty girl.

233
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,190
If you're a girl and you're out with a 
pretty girl,

234
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,040
no one is going to pay attention to you.
Everyone's going to pay any attention to

235
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:40,041
her,
and she didn't even do anything to 

236
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:40,041
deserve this.
She was just born this way and you're so

237
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:45,021
much funnier and so much cooler and 
you'd be so much pedal girlfriend and 

238
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:46,500
you will get crazy for that bitch and 
you'll try to trip her up.

239
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:51,501
You'll want her to fail.
You will hope she falls and breaks her 

240
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:51,501
fucking nose.
You know,

241
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:53,520
like literally like you're tired.
She's stealing from you.

242
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,300
She stealing mail attention from you.
You know?

243
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,200
That's how a lot of chicks feel about 
hot chicks,

244
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,400
man.
They don't like it.

245
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,560
So anything like that,
man,

246
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,150
if,
if that's your situation,

247
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,540
if you're around people like that or do 
shit to you and you've around ex 

248
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:08,540
boyfriends were,
do she,

249
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:08,540
you,
you just,

250
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,251
you can get into a bad grind where you 
just automatically get douchey first 

251
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:17,271
because you think they're going to get 
douchey first and you want to get the 

252
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:17,271
upper hand.

253
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:17,670
You know,
you ever getting those relationships,

254
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,680
we can tell that someone's fucking with 
you just to get the upper hand and 

255
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,620
expecting more and worse is when you go 
with it.

256
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,690
Just to see where it goes.
The worst for me is if I get involved in

257
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:35,190
it and I haven't been working out,
especially when I was younger.

258
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,930
Dude,
when I was younger,

259
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:41,931
I did not have such a good judgment and 
I still don't sometimes about when to 

260
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:43,320
argue and went to the school without 
fuck.

261
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,850
Am I arguing over,
back down.

262
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:46,470
I just argued automatically.
I'm like,

263
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,730
you're not going to stop me from 
arguing,

264
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,400
fuck you,
and it would just turn ugly every time.

265
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,720
Every time I got an argument with 
somebody,

266
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:54,270
it would turn ugly,
but as I got older,

267
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,480
you know any,
any kind of relationship like that when 

268
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,480
shit comes up now,
I just.

269
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,930
I tried very,
very hard now to just look at it and go,

270
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,310
what is the purpose of all this?
What or who gives a shit?

271
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,020
If you're right,
who gives a shit?

272
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,250
If you're wrong,
who gets,

273
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,640
here's what I want.
I want to be around people that I enjoy 

274
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,381
talking to and I know there can't really
be this many problems that we fight all 

275
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:20,841
the time.
If there's this many problems that we 

276
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:20,841
fight all the time,
where's that coming from?

277
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:25,100
That's got to be a personality thing 
because I don't have that many problems 

278
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,100
in my life.
My Life's pretty smooth.

279
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,550
Most of the people in my life were very 
nice.

280
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,270
Most of the people in my life,
we enjoy each other's company.

281
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:34,271
The very few.
I mean everybody has like here and 

282
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,981
there.
There'll be issues with any human being 

283
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:36,981
where someone sees something totally 
differently,

284
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:37,770
but you can talk it through and if 
you're really good friends,

285
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,140
you're work it out and everything's cool
and nobody ever gets ugly,

286
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,580
you know?
But the real key man is finding other 

287
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,121
people that go along with that because 
as soon as you go with someone who's 

288
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:53,120
used to do shit and is used to insulting
you and is used to playing games,

289
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,010
as soon as you go

290
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,080
into that and dive into that world,
man,

291
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,970
you're fucked.
No progress,

292
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,140
no fun,

293
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,380
and it's so hard to get at it,
so then once you get out of it,

294
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,080
you're so sad because he got out of it.
You have to get back in.

295
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,580
It's his because he felt so sad for you.

296
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,590
Getting out of that being alone man,
when you just got out of a relationship 

297
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,590
and then all of a sudden you're alone 
and lonely.

298
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,660
Those are the darkest empty.
It's hollow moments.

299
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:17,360
As an adult human being that feelings a 
terrible,

300
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:22,361
terrible feeling.
Most people just aren't equipped to 

301
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:22,760
understand rationally what's really 
going on,

302
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:26,270
like why are you so upset?
How much of this is just evolutionary?

303
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:31,271
How much is this?
It's been designed into the whole human 

304
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:34,391
mechanism too dreadful to feel dreadful.
Every time you're left alone to feel 

305
00:12:35,181 --> 00:12:36,890
terrible,
every time you're rejected,

306
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,150
you're being rejected by someone you 
don't even know is brutally painful.

307
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,820
Why is that?
Why is?

308
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,680
Why would you even care if it was a dude
who didn't like you?

309
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,420
If you had no desire to fuck that 
person?

310
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:49,010
If you just came up to a dude,
that dude was like,

311
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:49,430
look at you.

312
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,170
You don't even good looking.
You'd be like,

313
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,770
what the fuck you faggot.
You wouldn't care at all.

314
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,690
It wouldn't change your opinion of 
yourself at all,

315
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,060
but when a chick does it to,
it's like devastating.

316
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,290
Totally.
Especially if it's a chick that you're 

317
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:04,290
attracted to,
but it's all evolution.

318
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,380
It's all set up that way to try to get 
you to be as attractive as possible and 

319
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:14,081
to make very stringent standards that 
what people find and don't find a 

320
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:18,291
traction attractive.
It's to make you operate at a higher 

321
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,761
level.
I think it's all just designed to make 

322
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:24,821
you work harder as a human being to 
become more impressive as a mate and in 

323
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:27,350
doing so and it becoming more impressive
as a mate,

324
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,560
you get to contribute more to society.
You'll create more energy.

325
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,710
You'll create more money.
You'll create more whatever you do,

326
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:34,570
whether you.
If you don't,

327
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,650
you know your technology,
you'll innovate more.

328
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,360
If you're an art,
you're producing more art.

329
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,670
You want to prove your worth and so 
that,

330
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,730
that craziness like allows people to 
shine.

331
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:44,870
You know,

332
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,730
I can't find that girl though.
You know I can't.

333
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,850
I can't find that partner,
whereas on the same level as me,

334
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:51,920
it seems like they,
they,

335
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,120
uh,
always act like the same level,

336
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:56,100
but then once you get into it,
they're just,

337
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,190
they were just like kind of mimicking 
what they thought that that level is 

338
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,190
that

339
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,270
also that they want you to be something 
that you're not,

340
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,870
it's,
you know,

341
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,060
they want you to be a not even a real 
person,

342
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:11,061
you know,
they have a lot of people have an idea 

343
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:11,061
in their head that's really almost kind 
of based on movies,

344
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:11,280
you know.
Ah,

345
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,340
what was it like like before the 18 
hundreds based on movies?

346
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:15,690
Totally better.
Yeah.

347
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,220
To everybody.
But that's how it is.

348
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:22,221
You know,
you see movies and everything works out 

349
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:22,221
fucking awesome in the movies and you 
go,

350
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:22,500
well,
that's what life is like,

351
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:23,550
right?
Life is like this.

352
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:24,870
It's,
this is my model of life.

353
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,680
Sandra bullock movies and you get,
you get trapped in your head thinking,

354
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,960
well maybe this isn't.
Maybe he's not the one,

355
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,520
you know,
maybe there is another one.

356
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,180
Like God damn,
what is this crazy?

357
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,130
Well,
what about you?

358
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,650
Are you the one he probably not the one,
you know,

359
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,060
it might,
it might be,

360
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,080
you know,
the fucking problem might be you over 

361
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,080
and over again with everybody.
It's kind of like,

362
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,450
like the fight club or relationship 
where the whole time it actually is you.

363
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,000
Well Dude,
I've been that guy.

364
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,100
I've totally been that

365
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,290
guy,
but start arguments,

366
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,300
relationships for no reason just because
I was frustrated with my own life.

367
00:14:56,301 --> 00:15:00,050
Especially when I was really young.
I was 20 when I was like 20 and 21.

368
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,600
Oh,
it starts stupid arguments with girls.

369
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,880
I was dating over nothing but it wasn't 
really them.

370
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,710
That was the problem.
It was really me.

371
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was really me like being frustrated 
all the time with my life and trying to 

372
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,791
like being like hyper ambitious and 
trying to like get ahead in my life but 

373
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,510
really terrified that I was going to be 
a loser.

374
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,780
So I would always be like under stress 
and if anything annoys me about a check,

375
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,740
I would like been like,
why do you even talk like that?

376
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,610
Like what?
Meanwhile,

377
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:29,570
that's such a douchey thing to do,
to take your frustrations out on someone

378
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:30,980
else,
but when you're doing it,

379
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,330
when it's,
when you're wrapped up in it,

380
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:37,331
man,
especially if that's like everyone in 

381
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:37,331
your family,
that's everyone your friends with,

382
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:41,380
you know,
that's the only way you know it takes a 

383
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:41,600
long time to learn,
to not communicate shitty to people.

384
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,930
If you're stuck and like a shitty 
communication pattern,

385
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:46,970
fuck,
that's hard to snap out of that.

386
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,040
Very hard,
very hard to recognize how other people 

387
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,351
are seeing you.
Like so many people don't think that 

388
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:58,751
they come off as assholes.
They think they're just playing around 

389
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:58,751
and everybody's like,
oh,

390
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:59,720
this guy's such a Douche.
Get him away from me.

391
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,560
It's like,
fuck.

392
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,600
You can't take a joke.
It's not a joke of.

393
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,100
I don't think it's funny.
You know,

394
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,900
it's not a joke if no one else is 
laughing,

395
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,160
but you.
That's not a joke.

396
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,950
That's you being a douchebag and 
laughing about being a Douche bag.

397
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,290
What the fuck,
Brian,

398
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,480
how do we fix the world?

399
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Old?
Definitely not alcohol because it seems 

400
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,661
like more in the end I've fixed your 
vegas really taught me a lot about 

401
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,060
alcohol,
you know,

402
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:24,690
like just just seeing people on alcohol 
is just weird.

403
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,570
It does terrible things for your 
judgment.

404
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,630
I enjoyed myself so much more.
Saturday night I had water.

405
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,510
I drank water all night.
We went to that party,

406
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,680
smoked a little weed.
It was fun.

407
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,710
You know,
the problem with alcohol is everybody 

408
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,561
else else's drinking too and you wind up
getting stupid conversations over 

409
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:41,561
nothing.

410
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:41,561
It.
We,

411
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:46,451
we got to hang out with Doug Benson and 
I've never really even talked to him 

412
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:46,451
before.
You know,

413
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:50,681
I've seen him a couple times,
but hanging out with Doug Benson stone 

414
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:54,731
with a couple of beers in us,
I fucking had dance off with him for 

415
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:54,731
what?
Two hours,

416
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:56,240
me and him,
me and him were dancing.

417
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,700
I never,
he's a good dude.

418
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,260
We really enjoyed hanging out with.

419
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,070
He's a real good dude.
He,

420
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,210
I,
I've never really.

421
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:05,070
I've done his podcast before.
You know,

422
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:08,040
I've seen them like here and there clubs
and talked to them every now and then.

423
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,110
But this is the most time I ever spent 
with them by far.

424
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,120
We went to dinner with them and talk to 
them a lot.

425
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Who's cool man,

426
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,260
really cool guy.
And I always questioned how much he 

427
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,250
really enjoyed pot and I will never 
questioned his pot likeness again.

428
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:26,251
He fucking really questioned it.
That's so funny that stoners are always 

429
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:26,251
doing that.
Legit.

430
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:28,210
Why?
And I've totally felt for something that

431
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:31,480
happens to you every day,
almost it's where you go up to him like,

432
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:32,050
dude,
come on,

433
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,340
smoke weed.
I smoke a joint.

434
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:34,140
And he was just like,
no.

435
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:39,810
But I mean it's also like we're hanging 
out with other comics and stuff so it's 

436
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,230
a little different.
But still that happens to me.

437
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:42,900
How often?
Everyday.

438
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,980
Every time we're out at a club,
it seems like

439
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,120
every time.
Everywhere.

440
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:47,860
And you're like,
you don't know who these people are.

441
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:49,260
Like they could have crazy shit in 
there.

442
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:49,610
We'd

443
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,040
get high on acid.
I'm not going to drive home.

444
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:58,041
And you know the Double Lane,
double rainbow look up double rainbow on

445
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:03,520
Youtube.
No,

446
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,830
I don't want to see the bank.
Oh No,

447
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,840
no,
I just bought a two months so I even 

448
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,591
watched the whole video.
I watched like half of the video and I 

449
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:12,591
shut it off.
I get it,

450
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:12,750
I get it.
He's freaking out over rainbow.

451
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,900
The remix they did that robot voice,
what you know with the voice and the 

452
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,970
edit it real quick.
Kind of like of and they edit like Tim 

453
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,960
and Eric style,
that auto tune shit.

454
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:23,600
Catch on.
What the fuck happened?

455
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,390
I got paint on my iphone to you.
Do you like that stuff?

456
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,840
It's kind of cool.
Just like singing something that you 

457
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,391
thought of and then just changing the 
lyrics and next thing you know you can 

458
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,391
actually make it into a real song.

459
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,680
Like even if it's like you're going to 
hurt or you know that song,

460
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,180
that drake song,
it's over.

461
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:41,970
Does he use that Shit autotune?
Because I kinda liked that song.

462
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,850
I think everyone uses audit trail in the
pop industry right now.

463
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,630
The pump industry,
like Lindsay Lohan should be using pot.

464
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,050
The pato to.
Lindsay's going to do some time now.

465
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,930
Huh?
If you don't know ladies gentlemen.

466
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,790
Brian says,
where'd you read this off of?

467
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,240
I watched it live on cbs life,
you know,

468
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,800
they put it on video,
live courtroom.

469
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,830
She's going to do 90 days in jail.
That is just to turn herself in two 

470
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,581
weeks unless she suicides,
but she still has to wear the bracelet 

471
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,540
so she can't drink every day and they 
made it like a big deal.

472
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,080
Like we want to switch to a blood,
a blood thing instead of,

473
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:21,081
you know,
the scram and the reason why she wants 

474
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:21,081
to do that because if you drink alcohol 
at midnight,

475
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:21,870
like by 4:00
AM,

476
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,330
it's not in your blood anymore.
And that's why Lindsay wants to do that.

477
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,950
So it's so funny that the thing that 
really got to me was where they judge,

478
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,950
like heard Lindsey crying and stuff and 
the judge finally goes,

479
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,870
all right,
you did live here,

480
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:35,220
you live here,
you live here,

481
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:37,560
you lied here.
Next case you live here,

482
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,350
you live here.
You went through like,

483
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,070
like four cases of like seven.
I didn't know if Lockton,

484
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,970
someone up in jail is like the best way 
to deal with this,

485
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,590
but this should all be a bright example 
to people.

486
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,540
Uh,
really,

487
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,590
uh,
a prominent example to people.

488
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:57,020
How you shouldn't make your fucking kids
famous.

489
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,440
How many kids have to become incredibly 
fucked up from being famous child actors

490
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,650
before we look at it and go,
this is nuts.

491
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,600
There's no way you should be doing that 
to a child.

492
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:12,050
There's no way you should be developing 
as a human being.

493
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:15,050
Getting your shit together,
getting your ego together is hard enough

494
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:17,570
as it is.
But to have that developing,

495
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,780
getting your shit together and then mix 
it with fame.

496
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,310
God,
can you imagine 10 years from now,

497
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:25,980
will Smith's kids going to jump on your 
back and slice or next,

498
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,940
oh,
he's probably just going to be sad or 

499
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:32,940
no,
it's fine.

500
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:32,940
Well,
is a really brilliant guy.

501
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,900
He's a very smart guy.
He might figure out a way to raise his 

502
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,950
kid correctly through this,
but what an incredible fucking chore.

503
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,100
What an incredible responsibility and 
the amount of pressure you put on the 

504
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,260
kid because kids,
you know,

505
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,010
they get spoiled so easy.
Their perspective get fucked up

506
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,530
so quickly.
They haven't really developed character.

507
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:55,531
They tend to have a kid really be in a 
position where he never really has to 

508
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:56,080
overcome the same adversity of the rest 
of us have.

509
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,320
He just doesn't have the opportunity to 
develop the character that the rest of 

510
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,260
us are going to have.
The regular people that have to go 

511
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,631
through life and make their way as an 
adult and evolve as an adult and be an 

512
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:07,710
adult without money.
Where you're in a situation where you're

513
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,020
like,
wow,

514
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:13,021
I've got to figure out a way to get 
through this and to not have any fame 

515
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:13,080
whatsoever.
You know,

516
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,270
have to get by on your personality 
instead of get by on the fact that 

517
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,270
you're famous when you were six.

518
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,330
I heard that,
that,

519
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,670
that,
that first eight years of your life,

520
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,060
you learn 88 percent of what makes you 
who you are today.

521
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:29,061
Like the things like from from walking 
all the way to how you react to certain 

522
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:30,930
things and the rest is what you have to 
deal with,

523
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:33,360
like your ram on those.
Right?

524
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:33,990
Right,
right.

525
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:39,190
Yeah.
I've read some stuff about up to two 

526
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,190
years old.
I didn't read up to eight,

527
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,261
but it makes sense.
I mean a lot of who you are as a human 

528
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,070
being is based on what kind of input you
got when your mind was developing.

529
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,400
It only makes sense.
Your mind is going to prepare for a 

530
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,400
certain world,
you know,

531
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,521
they say that babies born into in into 
really high stress violent families 

532
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,590
where there's a lot of shouting and 
yelling and you know,

533
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:02,770
too many people,
like if you're in a really bad 

534
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,541
neighborhood and you know too many 
people in your house and there's a lot 

535
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:04,541
of stress all the time.
People,

536
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,580
babies born literally are wired 
different than babies that are born into

537
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:10,690
calm households and babies that are born
into calm households.

538
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:14,210
Like the less stress you have,
the more chilled out the baby can be.

539
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,910
But if you have like a really,
really tense mom,

540
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:19,310
that kid's going to come out just ready 
to snap.

541
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,890
That kid's going to come out recognizing
danger.

542
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,590
I had this long talk on a plane with 
Michael Irvin.

543
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,860
Michael Irvin was on a plane to 
Australia.

544
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:32,861
We were all going to the UFC.
He was going there to do some football 

545
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:35,681
thing with Russell Russell Crowe and I 
had met him because I did a best damn 

546
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:38,300
sports show period and he was on it and 
he's a real cool guy,

547
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:40,610
man.
And very down to Earth normal dude.

548
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,120
And so he and I were talking and we're 
just talking about kids getting involved

549
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:47,330
in martial arts and kids getting 
involved in sports.

550
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:50,930
And he was talking about like what he 
was like when he was young that,

551
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:53,300
you know,
he's trying to like teach kids,

552
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,040
you know,
about controlling themselves,

553
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,020
keep teach kids about keeping their shit
together.

554
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,530
And this was right after that dude that,
I don't remember the football player,

555
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:05,531
but he was chasing after his girlfriend.
He jumped in the back of a truck and he 

556
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:05,531
fell out and died.
I remember that.

557
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,500
I don't remember the guy's name.
Yeah,

558
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,970
he was talking about that guy that,
that guy that,

559
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,380
that was not thinking.
He was just reacting like you don't 

560
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:14,380
think you don't do shit like that when 
you're thinking,

561
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,750
but these guys aren't thinking they just
react and that he's trying to teach them

562
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:22,150
how to like put some steps in there to 
like consider things before you act and,

563
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:27,151
and recognize that there's a reason why 
you are so quick to behave like that and

564
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:32,411
that these people,
these reckless type people are the ones 

565
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,051
who are always involved in like really 
strong competitive athletics like 

566
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:35,950
fighting and men football and shit like 
that because they're,

567
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,960
they're so much more quick to react.
There's so much more explosive that a 

568
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,531
lot of it is just stress based me to.
So many fighters are born from shitty 

569
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,530
households.
So many.

570
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,470
Yeah.
I mean it's somehow a prerequisite.

571
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:53,471
There's guys from strong families that 
still are great fighters because they 

572
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:53,471
just accept that,
you know,

573
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:58,240
they just love the challenge.
Like George St Pierre is a perfect 

574
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,240
example of that.
Very close with his dad,

575
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,050
but a lot of guys come from fucking 
broken homes,

576
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:01,300
man,
and there's a,

577
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,230
there's something in that.
There's something in that.

578
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:08,290
The fury is just a little more intense 
from a dude who grows up without a dad 

579
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,280
or dude to grows up in like a real 
shitty situation.

580
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
You know?
It's fucking crazy,

581
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:18,761
man.
When he really stopped to think about 

582
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:18,761
it,
it's crazy that anybody would want their

583
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,390
kid to be famous.
The Lindsay Lohan thing,

584
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:22,700
this should be the last draw.
Well,

585
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,980
there shouldn't be some condo laws about
it.

586
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:27,380
Definitely,
but I think most of the people that have

587
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:28,920
their kids,
it's because they're,

588
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,920
they're broken dreams and they're using 
their kids,

589
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:31,370
you know,
to.

590
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,920
Do you think that's it?
It was just a lack of awareness there.

591
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,420
Lack,
lack of real,

592
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:36,800
real consideration.
You see?

593
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:38,870
Nobody thinks it's an offensive thing.
Like,

594
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:39,650
you know,
if you,

595
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,690
if you tell them,
you know,

596
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,360
all my daughter's a acting,
she's in a commercial.

597
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:44,860
They go,
Oh,

598
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,160
good for you.
Nobody ever goes,

599
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,060
wow,
what are you doing?

600
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,860
Like why are you putting your kid on tv?
Nobody.

601
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,630
Nobody ever says that.
Nobody ever says it like,

602
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:51,590
Whoa,
you're putting,

603
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,840
you're going to fuck your kid up.
You're going to get your kid famous.

604
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,120
You know what the odds are?
If you've got your kid famous,

605
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,250
what are the odds of your kids going to 
grow up and be a mess?

606
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,160
So like 90 percent.
Why would you ever.

607
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:01,670
I mean,
yeah,

608
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:06,671
there's a few that get through it and 
they're okay that Jodie foster's of the 

609
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,460
world that seemed to be adjusted,
but they're fucking rare.

610
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,890
Dude,
what are you making it?

611
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,540
Why the fuck is that?
Oh,

612
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,980
I forgot to ask video.
Just making.

613
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,910
He forgot to,
to really forget that did I really did 

614
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,330
something so fucking silly.
He made the lesbian lick the hand thing.

615
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,650
Yeah,
I mean what the fuck man you to develop 

616
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,260
and to think that you're special right 
from the beginning.

617
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,270
I mean,
Lindsay Lohan was famous from.

618
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,490
She was one of those Disney hookers,
right?

619
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,850
So many Disney hookers there is.
They breed them.

620
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,770
They make these little hot little 
hookers.

621
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,050
Let's count them off.
Who are the Disney hookers?

622
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:40,190
Christy,
Christina Aguilera.

623
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:42,990
She had Disney made it through 
timberlake.

624
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:44,660
Was He cool?
He's got it together.

625
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,000
Dude.
That dude's got it totally down.

626
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:47,700
He really?
Yeah.

627
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,160
That's super six festival guy.
He's still super successful too though.

628
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:54,910
There's never a drop off.
Drop off.

629
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,880
It's all right,
Carrie.

630
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,770
Whatever.

631
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,300
When they drop off,
that's when they get nuts.

632
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,090
Right?
Right.

633
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,350
It's hard to rebound and people want to 
see how far you fall and crash.

634
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,820
So they kind of support.
You're dropping,

635
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,770
right.
You know,

636
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,760
they turn their energy on while he's 
really failing.

637
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,850
You have to hit rock bottom and then 
they'll let you come back up again.

638
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,640
You know,
you have to Britney Spears that you have

639
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:16,760
to fucking just ride that boat.
Run into the rocks now.

640
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:21,761
Do you think Brittany has snapped back 
or do you think she has just a new 

641
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:22,940
person that protects their nonstop,
you know,

642
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:26,060
like I am hired to make sure you don't 
fuck up ever again.

643
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,540
You don't fix that kind of crazy.
You don't fix it.

644
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,350
That shit is not fixable.
That's crazy to the bones,

645
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:34,460
man.
Just,

646
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,290
you know,
she's,

647
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,720
she's fucking nuts.
They're not fixing anything.

648
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,570
That's a real simple case to me.

649
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,040
Case closed.
They just,

650
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,730
they're just handling her.
Are they married?

651
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:46,050
Brian Austin.
Green.

652
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,880
The fuck happened.
Oh,

653
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,440
what's her face?
Megan Fox.

654
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,320
You think she's.
She's Wacky to Brian.

655
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,100
Austin Green.
Actually,

656
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:53,740
I don't tell you young.
Right?

657
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,140
Was She?
When she got famous?

658
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,440
She probably is a really cool chick if 
she met and married Brian Austin Green.

659
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,080
Well,
yeah.

660
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,020
Right.
Think about that.

661
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,310
It's not even right.
Who's not even working anymore?

662
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,350
Chick ever either.
That uh,

663
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,570
Brian Austin Green.
It's like a pimp of unimaginable.

664
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:11,571
We partially a pimp.
He doesn't have his name tattooed on 

665
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:11,571
her.
Yeah,

666
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:12,170
I say he's a pimp.
Daddy has to be a.

667
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,210
well you can hate all you want about 
anybody.

668
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:17,730
Can you know you people out there you 
want to hate?

669
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,290
What if that was you?
I don't know.

670
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,400
It's just if you're at the peach pit,
which guy would you choose?

671
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:22,500
You know,
peach pit.

672
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,290
The list.
You have to take it to some dark,

673
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,630
dark place.
This Brian Austin Green fellow.

674
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:29,670
Isn't he like a rapper now?
Doesn't need wrap.

675
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,290
Does he really?
It doesn't mean.

676
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,850
I don't know.
I didn't think he did A.

677
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,800
I think we need to find out right now.
This is the beautiful.

678
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,940
This is beautiful.
What a beautiful time to be alive and 

679
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:39,940
the Internet.
If you have a question,

680
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,360
he just throw that pitch into google.
So simple.

681
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,050
Brian Austin,
green wrapping.

682
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:47,800
We are about to find out,
ladies and gentlemen,

683
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,810
we don't have to go to the fucking 
library.

684
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,850
We don't have to go to a college and 
meet some experts.

685
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,090
Have Brian?
I said,

686
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,920
okay.
That was on TV.

687
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:57,810
That wasn't.
No.

688
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,690
See,
that's what I think it is.

689
00:27:58,691 --> 00:28:03,691
I think it's.
I think it's just a like he had to go 

690
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:06,871
into his wiki.
I see what the moment and rap history

691
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,380
around the same time,
his character,

692
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,400
David silver,
started wrapping his lyrical stylings.

693
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,910
You are so precious to me and my 
precious to you.

694
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,540
The answer Brian is yes.

695
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,860
That was so pointless.
I missed the very beginning of it,

696
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:43,410
but still he didn't have his rapping 
mean it had some of his lyrics.

697
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,840
I think that they're just saying that he
was a rapper,

698
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,870
but it was whack,
but we can't play it because they don't 

699
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,870
have to pay him or something.
Oh really?

700
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,870
You know,
something like that [inaudible] that was

701
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,230
on vh one.
Well,

702
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:56,231
they,
they were also saying that he's wack 

703
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:56,790
mean they quoted his lyrics.
That's pretty wack.

704
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,130
It sucks.
That's just like those lyrics were so 

705
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,601
whack.
Like you don't even have to pass a 

706
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:07,281
judgment on them.
You just playing for people and raise 

707
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:09,501
your eyebrows and go.
So it gives you that movie with Jesus 

708
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:09,501
camp.
Uh,

709
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:10,380
yeah.
Crazy,

710
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,960
crazy fucking moving.
And the best part about the movies,

711
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,990
they didn't cast any judgment.
They just showed you these nutty 

712
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,220
motherfuckers that are out there raising
kids to be Christian jihadists,

713
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,620
you know that you don't have to,
you don't have to cast anything and the 

714
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:25,980
people are so nutty that they'll approve
it.

715
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,820
You could show them the fucking video 
and they would,

716
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,560
they would,
they would say,

717
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:29,220
Yep,
that's our,

718
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,140
that's our message.
You got our message down,

719
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:32,730
sir.
That's a good documentary.

720
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,230
Meanwhile,
anybody who saw that thing,

721
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:39,231
it was like a fucking horror movie 
taking little kids and the best part is 

722
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:41,290
when they make them talk in tongues.
Did you see that part?

723
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,840
They would say everybody now talking 
tons.

724
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,600
So the kids would go Sharmila,
Mola,

725
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:46,020
Mola,
Mola,

726
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,520
mark.
Hello,

727
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,260
hello.
Am I god talking through them in 

728
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,370
tongues?
It's hilarious.

729
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,650
They're five years old,
man,

730
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,010
five years old.
It's nonsense.

731
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,960
They love nonsense.
Five years old.

732
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:00,130
Love to talk.
Nonsense.

733
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:05,131
All five-year-old kids do.
So you give them like a time of the day 

734
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:05,131
at school.
Our kids time to go.

735
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:09,961
Nonsense.
So they just go through fantasy and they

736
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,820
tuck it in.
This made up language and it's obviously

737
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:16,300
not a fucking language because you're 
not saying anything.

738
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,670
You.
I can tell when I'm listening to someone

739
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,440
talk,
even if they have a foreign language,

740
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,600
I can tell if it's a real language.
You know,

741
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:25,240
you hear someone talking in like in 
Chinese,

742
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,100
like they're saying a bunch of crazy 
shit,

743
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:29,410
but there is a flow to it where you 
know,

744
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,680
they're not seeing the same sounds over 
and over and over and over again.

745
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,280
Which is what you do because you have to
invent all these sounds on the fly.

746
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:41,281
If you're making a fake language,
like to have them very to the point 

747
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:43,840
where it looks like it's like an actual 
like language that's difficult.

748
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:48,730
So you start going,
which is what they all do.

749
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,760
They're all uncreative fucks and they're
talking in tongues and they're just 

750
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,400
making nonsense noises.
That's all they're doing,

751
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:59,401
man.
And they're getting little kids to do 

752
00:30:59,401 --> 00:30:59,401
this shit and they're telling these kids
that,

753
00:30:59,401 --> 00:30:59,401
you know,
you know your,

754
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,330
your warriors for Christ and there this 
woman,

755
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:06,331
it was comparing them to how,
you know Hamas and all these terrorist 

756
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,290
organizations raised little jihadists.
She was literally comparing them.

757
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,170
She's comparing them like,
why don't we do that with Christianity?

758
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:16,171
Like this would be a good thing.
The reason why these people are willing 

759
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:16,171
to blow themselves up.

760
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:17,110
It's because they indoctrinated them 
into the world of radical Islam.

761
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,080
We can do the same thing but for good.
She's like,

762
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,100
but we're good.
Not seeing the.

763
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,420
The irony,
you know,

764
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:24,560
in the brainwashing kids she's talking 
to,

765
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:29,670
well,
they're getting brainwashed with the 

766
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,231
wrong thing,
but if we brainwash our kids with the 

767
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:31,231
truth and Jesus and like,
Whoa,

768
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:37,070
Jerell how to raise kids.
I had two guys a knock on my door today 

769
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,730
that we're both my age dressed up in the
white shirts and the ties and stuff like

770
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,650
that.
Is that a scientology or a mormon?

771
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,820
That's a more memory more.
I just,

772
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,890
I laugh.
What are some of the nicest fucking 

773
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:48,890
people I have to take?
It might be but are so nice.

774
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,740
I can't stop laughing at them.
You know?

775
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,550
It's just ridiculous.
It's completely ridiculous.

776
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,610
The whole look.
It's all ridiculous though.

777
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,000
It's not that,
you know,

778
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,350
being a Muslim isn't ridiculous,
but being a Jew is everything's 

779
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,250
ridiculous.
Being a Catholics,

780
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,710
ridiculous.
Being a president,

781
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,780
Protestants,
ridiculous.

782
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:10,360
Being a baptist,
being a Buddhist is ridiculous.

783
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:15,510
Being an anything is ridiculous.
You're a fucking human being and if you 

784
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,750
attach,
you attach yourself and your mind to any

785
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:21,751
ideology,
you're going to be on a road and that 

786
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:22,600
road may or may not lead you in a good 
direction,

787
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,760
but you're going to stay on that fucking
road.

788
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:27,760
If you're attached to an ideology,
and it could be a terrible road,

789
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,030
it could be a road of circumcising,
your daughter's cliteracy because that's

790
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:36,031
a fucking tradition.
I mean these fucking crazy bitches in 

791
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:37,480
Africa that cut holes in their lip and 
stretch them out to put plates on.

792
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:42,481
Why is that?
Because they got on a fucking road and 

793
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:44,801
they stick.
They stuck with that road regardless of 

794
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:44,801
rational thinking.

795
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:44,801
They didn't use rational thinking at 
all.

796
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,930
They're just adapted a predetermined 
pattern or behavior that makes life so 

797
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,050
much more simple and that's what every 
fucking religion is.

798
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,720
The problem is no one knows.
You cannot.

799
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,850
No.
You can have your own beautiful personal

800
00:32:55,851 --> 00:33:00,851
experiences.
You could have been the person that was 

801
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:02,471
actually touched by God,
but when you start yelling and ranting 

802
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:05,741
that other people have to follow your 
lead or the fucking world's gonna end 

803
00:33:05,741 --> 00:33:07,370
and Christian is going to be taken away.
I know you're full of shit.

804
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,830
I know you're full of Shit and you know 
you're full of shit.

805
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,980
And the real problem is that we can't 
say it because everybody's got this 

806
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:14,980
freedom of religion,
freedom of religion,

807
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,000
religious freedom,
the freedom to express yourself.

808
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,400
Even if you're expressing yourself with 
nonsense.

809
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,680
Nonsense that helps.
Scared,

810
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:22,790
lonely,
sad.

811
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:26,330
People lock onto that nonsense so they 
feel like they're a part of something.

812
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,380
I mean,
that's what it is.

813
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,510
It preys on people whose lives fucking 
suck.

814
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,460
So it's all nuts.
It's not like your shit's cool and my,

815
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,910
it's not.
And it's not that,

816
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:40,030
you know,
Yoga is the answer or fucking mushrooms 

817
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,030
are the answer.
There's,

818
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,620
there's just questions and until we're 
honest about that,

819
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,740
we're never going to evolve.
The human race is stuck in a giant 

820
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,110
quagmire when it comes to our behavior 
and our thinking about our behavior.

821
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,220
Yeah,
totally.

822
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:54,560
And you know,
and one thing is like they all look like

823
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:58,610
from the Geek squad,
these at these Mormon guys on 10 states.

824
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,640
Can you imagine though if they mixed it 
up and like showed up with like,

825
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:06,641
you know,
Harry chess and necklaces and like rave 

826
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:06,641
clothes on and sunglasses.

827
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:10,530
Sorry.
That would be if the Mormons came to 

828
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:10,530
your house.
Just started rocking it.

829
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:10,530
Yeah.
Like they pull up,

830
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,780
pull up in like a,
you know what it says new Chevy's 

831
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:15,780
whatever.
Yeah.

832
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,030
Man,
I don't,

833
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,180
I don't think the world's ready for like
a hip religion yet.

834
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,450
There was some work that we're doing 
with rock and roll churches.

835
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:23,160
Remember that?
Yeah.

836
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,330
They still have those.
Yeah.

837
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,650
That is still popular.
Really popular.

838
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:31,680
My name is,
there was a girl that used to work at 

839
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:31,990
fear factor.
She's a very nice girl and she uh,

840
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,710
was,
you know,

841
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,740
trying to fireplace and she started 
going to a rock and roll church saying 

842
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:44,131
how much I would really love this rock 
and roll church could even though this 

843
00:34:44,131 --> 00:34:47,410
guy's talking about God,
he's really all just about being 

844
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,771
positive.
And that's the vehicle that he uses for 

845
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:49,771
a lot of people,
man,

846
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:54,340
religion can give you some inspiration,
but there comes a certain point in time 

847
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,381
where you have to pop the training 
wheels off and you have to recognize 

848
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:01,171
that all this mortality that you've 
developed is good because it's good to 

849
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:01,171
treat other people good.

850
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,360
It's good to treat other people the way 
you would like to be treated yourself.

851
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:06,790
It's like a fucking golden rule and 
there's a reason for it,

852
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:11,791
and that reason is that we're connected 
in some strange way that we don't 

853
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:15,211
totally understand.
Unless you are good to other people 

854
00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:18,121
around you,
unless you were kind and friendly and 

855
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:20,641
warm and loving,
you're not going fucking enjoy this 

856
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:20,641
life.
You're just not.

857
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:21,910
You're going to be problems everywhere 
you go.

858
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,620
You're going to have problems everywhere
you go.

859
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,930
You got to figure out a way to enjoy 
this fucking life.

860
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,320
It's not because of Jesus.
It's not because of Moses.

861
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:32,200
It's not because of anybody that may or 
may not have ever existed.

862
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:34,480
It's because that's how you fit in 
better in the world.

863
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,660
That's how you stay positive and it 
doesn't have to some shit that was 

864
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:39,660
written

865
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,130
5,000
years ago and fucking animal skins.

866
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:43,590
That doesn't have to be the golden rule 
because it's old,

867
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,520
you know?
That's dumb.

868
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,040
We need to figure out like now,
today,

869
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,580
what is the best way to live your life?
What is the,

870
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:55,581
you know there.
There's got to be ways for you can be 

871
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:55,581
putting forward the most positive 
energy.

872
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:56,550
I mean,
we know objective Lee,

873
00:35:56,551 --> 00:36:01,551
what's causing pollution.
We know objective really what's causing 

874
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:05,000
birth defects and you know,
and we're taking it too much chemicals 

875
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,370
and not enough vitamins.
We know objective,

876
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:10,371
we all this stuff.
We know how to organize our world and 

877
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:13,521
yet we don't do it.
We know how to organize our health and 

878
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:13,521
yet very few people do it.
We know all these things.

879
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,920
The right path to like being like a 
happy,

880
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:21,921
healthy person is to do all the shit 
that we already know you're supposed to 

881
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:21,921
do.

882
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:23,040
Take care of your body,
take care of your health,

883
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,000
take care of your mind.
You're stress.

884
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,370
Meditate.
Be kind to people.

885
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:27,630
We all know that.
I mean,

886
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:32,631
you ask anybody,
they know how to get by and to be the 

887
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:33,450
the most evolved version of you that you
can be.

888
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,820
I mean,
it's not like a magical checklist.

889
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,080
If you talked to people about it,
you said,

890
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,670
okay,
here you got a person.

891
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:43,671
You want to improve them.
What are the things you're gonna do to 

892
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:43,671
them?
Okay,

893
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:43,671
well,
if I was a life coach,

894
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:47,931
the first thing I would say is this 
guy's got to get on a diet that makes 

895
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:47,931
them healthy.
I don't mean to die just to lose weight.

896
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:50,730
I mean just healthy foods in your body.
Many,

897
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:52,440
many vegetables,
vegetables,

898
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,010
a lot of good,
good quality protein,

899
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,800
a lot of water stopped the sodas.

900
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,830
Stop the bullshit.
Start working out your body and get a 

901
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,010
better sense of like how this machine 
feels.

902
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,650
When it's moving,
it's flowing better.

903
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:12,651
There's less tension in it.
Your mind feels like relaxed and you 

904
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:13,680
enjoy every single moment of the day 
better.

905
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,350
Step one,
everybody knows that step,

906
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:17,390
right?
What step to be cool to people.

907
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,220
Be Nice to as many people as you can,
smile and as many people as you can,

908
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,320
have them smile back at you.
Tip well,

909
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:24,450
when you go to restaurants,
just do the most.

910
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,700
You can be as nice as you can,
you know,

911
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,840
and just still managed to not have 
people walk all over you just get 

912
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:31,840
through this life and it's nice as you 
can.

913
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,420
What else?
Do what you want to do with your life,

914
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,080
right?
Don't,

915
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:35,720
don't go be doing something you don't 
enjoy.

916
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,310
Don't do something that's don't get 
locked into,

917
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:43,311
you know,
a car that you can't afford and doing 

918
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:43,311
something crazy because you need the 
money.

919
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:43,311
Don't,
don't do that.

920
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:47,900
Do what you want to do.
Do what the fuck is it that you really 

921
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,090
want to do because if someone else is 
doing it,

922
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,770
you can do it.
You know?

923
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,860
I mean everybody makes their own path 
through this world,

924
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:58,310
but a lot of people don't follow the 
path that they really fucking feel 

925
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,100
pulled to.
You know,

926
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,380
for whatever reason,
they got negative programming and then 

927
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:04,380
when they were kids,
someone told them they couldn't do it or

928
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,690
told them to take the shortcut or,
or take the,

929
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:07,080
uh,
the,

930
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:09,810
the shorter route.
That's a sad thing,

931
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:10,860
man.
When he talked to dudes,

932
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:15,861
especially like talented dudes and they 
don't follow up with what they want to 

933
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:15,861
do.
You know,

934
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:16,440
nobody like that.

935
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:22,390
I don't know,
but I was just thinking to your list 

936
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,981
that I think you should never stop 
tickling people and I don't know why 

937
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:26,450
it's looked down upon because I enjoy 
making people laugh,

938
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,610
you know,
including tickling,

939
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:30,790
forcing them to laugh.
I don't like people to him.

940
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,490
Why are you ticklish ticklish where you 
tickle tickle,

941
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,010
you know?
Do you

942
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,710
know where ticklish.
This is an interesting subject.

943
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,230
You know where this comes from,
it's an evolutionary trait and it's from

944
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,770
being freaked out instantly and 
immediately about spiders and insects 

945
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,820
crawling on you because if you're 
sleeping on the ground,

946
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:50,470
yeah,
because if you're sleeping on the ground

947
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,810
and some things on you and you fucking 
move like that,

948
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,920
that's what ticklish.
It's.

949
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,760
You're trying to avoid these instant 
reactions to these weird sensitive areas

950
00:38:57,761 --> 00:38:59,680
or body,
especially things where things can crawl

951
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,710
like under your armpits.
You touched my armpit.

952
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,510
I'll jump through the fucking roof.
I've fuck it,

953
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,190
but that's what it is.
You know what I'm saying?

954
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:09,040
It's like this is all.
It's an evolutionary thing.

955
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,960
It did not know.
That makes sense.

956
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:16,170
Of course.
Why else would you have this extreme 

957
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:16,480
reaction on the bottom of your feet?
That's where you're stepping on things.

958
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,090
Not Ticklish at all though.

959
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:23,090
I mean,
because there's topes and they're 

960
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:23,090
supposed to die because,
you know,

961
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,630
I dated this girl that I even went to 
the unit that she was willing to date 

962
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,470
you so fucked up.
That's a b.

963
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,430
um,
she's,

964
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,460
she's ready to be bitten by a spider.
I always go for the Butler was the last 

965
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,921
move though,
like if you're not tick less of your 

966
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:37,921
tickets in the butthole and then it 
usually gets them.

967
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:39,460
You ever watch a porno where a girl's 
got a rubber butthole and you're like,

968
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,470
this is ridiculous.
How is this chick taking this?

969
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:44,020
The ass pound in the ass?
Yeah.

970
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,430
How do they do that?
I don't know,

971
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,780
but I'm seeing the Bella,
Donna one.

972
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,040
She's crazy and so it's talked about 
them in the podcast before we.

973
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:56,080
We looked it up and then we found out 
there was like we looked up a baseball 

974
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,690
bat porn because we thought it would 
only be one bella.

975
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,500
Donna video.
No.

976
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,820
Was like a bunch of videos.
Chicks with bats up the Ras.

977
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,090
I think it's once a girl puts a bat up 
her ass.

978
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:03,890
Then the,
the,

979
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,400
the porn guys like to come to the other 
checks and go see,

980
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,450
look,
she's willing to do it,

981
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,950
but you don't want to do it.
You don't want to work.

982
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,730
He just can add it to your resume.
That's an icon.

983
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Next.
Her job that you would get that you 

984
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:15,800
wouldn't have got before too.
Dark roads on.

985
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,900
It's kind of weird.
I would like to see like the resumes of 

986
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:20,900
some of these girls will do baseball 
bats.

987
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,720
Eat Donkey ass.
Fucking funny story.

988
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:23,690
There was a dude,
uh,

989
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,050
that was uh,
friends with a friend of mine.

990
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,610
I didn't know the guy that well,
but uh,

991
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,670
he was dating a porn star and uh,
he was like trying to be cool with it 

992
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,520
because he didn't have any money and she
was,

993
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,170
you know,
paying the bills and shit and he was,

994
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,320
I think it was a musician and she came 
home with a contract and it was just,

995
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:41,510
you know,
it's just sex ban.

996
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,250
So big deal.
Yeah.

997
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:44,020
I'm allowed to fuck other girls from on 
the road to,

998
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,130
you know,
we're just open,

999
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,370
still a big deal and she doesn't fuck 
any of those guys when she's not working

1000
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:48,880
with them,
you know,

1001
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:53,881
the whole deal.
He had this whole rationalization thing 

1002
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:54,670
and then he got a contract and he's 
going over the contract and he goes,

1003
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,470
what's this,
what's this?

1004
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,420
What's this airtight?
What does that mean?

1005
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:03,190
And she goes,
airtight is one of my mouth,

1006
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:06,770
one of my asshole and one of my posting.
And he goes this,

1007
00:41:06,771 --> 00:41:10,810
this relationship's over,
this fucking threw in the towel,

1008
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:12,370
right?
Then in there he's like,

1009
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:13,270
what,
what,

1010
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,790
what's,
but at the same time,

1011
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,470
one in your asshole,
one of your,

1012
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:19,180
and they have a name for it.
Okay.

1013
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:21,020
And you're about to go air tight?
Yeah,

1014
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,810
I'm done.
That's it.

1015
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,220
But a fucking.

1016
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,060
Forget it.
And Hooker.

1017
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,430
Triple Rainbow.
Damn.

1018
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,520
First of all,
you know any girl that would let you do 

1019
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:32,520
that?
Any girl.

1020
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,410
Whoa.
Any girl that wants to that.

1021
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,560
And any girl that is in a relationship 
with a man is like cool with her doing 

1022
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,710
that.
You've got a whole lot of problems.

1023
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,420
There was,
there was this girl who was a.

1024
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,480
there's this guy,
I'm a nice Einstein up a Salami was his 

1025
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,670
name Steve.
I think he lives in Seattle now.

1026
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,470
Cool Dude.
He was a producer.

1027
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:52,820
Didn't like it.
Got Out of it.

1028
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:54,650
You said the whole business is just 
fucked up.

1029
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,070
It's all crazy and everyone's a mess and
he just wants to be a healthier person.

1030
00:41:58,071 --> 00:41:59,780
So now he's teaching Jujitsu.
Super Nice Guy.

1031
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,040
So anyway,
um,

1032
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,600
he uh,
tells us,

1033
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,460
hey man,
come,

1034
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,270
come see me.
We're,

1035
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,990
we're doing a porno shoot,
uh,

1036
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,710
come,
uh,

1037
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,400
come watch it.

1038
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,130
It's pretty fun.
So uh,

1039
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,700
I was with tate and we're like,
all right,

1040
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:11,410
fuck it.
We'll go.

1041
00:42:11,411 --> 00:42:14,990
And we just got back from the road.
We just landed from some gig and this is

1042
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:15,920
one.
Tate was staying with me.

1043
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:21,220
So before we went to my house,
we just drove to this guy's fucking 

1044
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,220
porno.
Shoot me right out of the airport,

1045
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,310
right?
We walk in the door,

1046
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,240
we walk in the door and there's this one
guy with guns tattooed on his body.

1047
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,040
He's got like guns,
like,

1048
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,150
yeah,
one of those dudes.

1049
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,560
And then the other guy is just this 
regular muscle looking dude and they are

1050
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,230
ruining this bitch.
They are ruining her.

1051
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:41,380
One guy is pounding her asshole with his
deck and one guy is fucking her mouth 

1052
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,850
and every couple of seconds they pull 
her off off the Deq and spit in her 

1053
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:45,850
mouth.

1054
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,600
So this girl goes to this terrible day 
of all this spitting fucking around.

1055
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:55,601
It's all fucking her pussy.
And then when it's all over she goes 

1056
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:56,750
into the shower and she wants everyone 
to piss in her mouth.

1057
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,740
So these porno stars start peeing in her
mouth.

1058
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:05,741
And she sits there with her mouth open 
and then that she wants a director do 

1059
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:05,741
it.
You get over here.

1060
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:09,550
So the director goes over and he pees in
her mouth and I am watching this whole 

1061
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:09,550
thing.
I'm like,

1062
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,030
this might be the saddest shit I've ever
seen in my life.

1063
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:13,700
This girl is on her knees in the shower.
Okay.

1064
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:16,040
The water's pouring all over.
She's totally wet.

1065
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,860
She's been pounded in the asshole in the
mouth all day.

1066
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:24,250
Two dudes have taken turns spitting in 
her mouth of three dudes because the 

1067
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,610
director did it to spitting them out to 
everybody was spending in her mouth.

1068
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:31,060
And now she's on her knees and there's a
dude pissing in her mouth and they're 

1069
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,060
filming it.
And I'm like,

1070
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,700
wow.
So then she goes,

1071
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,120
my boyfriend's going to pick me up at 
four or something like that.

1072
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,240
And we're like,
your boyfriend a man.

1073
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,240
And I didn't want to talk to her.
I didn't want to be mean.

1074
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:43,370
I didn't want to be judgmental.
I didn't want to say anything.

1075
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,480
I,
I introduced myself.

1076
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:45,750
Hi Joe.
Nice to meet you.

1077
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,170
I'm going to watch you.
Fuck me.

1078
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:53,171
And my friend tate here,
we're gonna sit and watch you get 

1079
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:54,791
fucked.
So we were sitting like maybe 10 feet 

1080
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:58,811
away from this standing,
standing maybe 10 feet away while 

1081
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:00,200
there's these two dudes were pounded on 
this chick and then these guys,

1082
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,260
pete and this girl's mouth.
And then she starts talking about her 

1083
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:05,260
boyfriend.
Where's your boyfriend doing?

1084
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,390
He's a cook.
So like a short order cook at Denny's or

1085
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:10,580
some shit like that.
And uh,

1086
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,930
you know,
and I go,

1087
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:13,250
is your,
is your husband?

1088
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,720
I'm cool with all this cool that long as
I keep bringing them checks,

1089
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,710
he's cool with it.
And so,

1090
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:19,630
uh,
Taikos goes,

1091
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,410
does a,
is he allowed to fuck anybody else?

1092
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:22,160
She goes,
he better not,

1093
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:24,190
I'll fucking kill him.
Oh my God,

1094
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,150
whoa.
He better not,

1095
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:27,140
I'll fucking kill.
I'm like,

1096
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:29,930
what did I just watch?
This is just,

1097
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:35,230
this might be the nuttiest fucking scene
I've ever been a part of that my whole 

1098
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:35,230
life.
I was like,

1099
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:35,940
this is so strange.
And it's awful.

1100
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,950
Do you remember her name?
Her name or anything?

1101
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:39,780
No idea.
I wouldn't remember her face.

1102
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,650
Her name.
Anything.

1103
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,150
I'd never seen her before.
Again,

1104
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,680
there's so many of them.
Dude,

1105
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,660
there's so much porn going on out here.

1106
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,880
There's so many dudes that I know.
I know.

1107
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:50,730
So many guys from Jujitsu.
Tyler night,

1108
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,640
I know him.
He's a porn dude.

1109
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,120
Very cool guy.
He's got a really awesome blog too.

1110
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:59,640
He writes about Gangbang scenes and shit
like that.

1111
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,930
And uh,
Jake Steve used to train a Machado's and

1112
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:07,530
then there was another dude that used to
train the Machados Titi Boi.

1113
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:08,970
And then,
uh,

1114
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,790
John,
the form,

1115
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,610
that's his real name.
I'm not supposed to.

1116
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:16,611
Vince Vaughn,
Vince for is another fucking male porn 

1117
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:16,611
stars.
Just like a gang of a man.

1118
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:18,330
There's like all these porn guys.
There's so many,

1119
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,790
so much porn going on out here.
It's ridiculous.

1120
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:23,490
They're all girls come out here with 
like,

1121
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,080
you know,
whatever issues and you know,

1122
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,420
looking for a dream.
And a lot of them it doesn't work out.

1123
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:35,450
And the next thing you know they're 
doing porn and then there's girls that 

1124
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,911
just have always wanted to get into porn
and then they just fucking like Sasha 

1125
00:45:37,911 --> 00:45:38,970
grey type checks.
They come here when they're 18,

1126
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,190
good to go,
ready to suck dick on film.

1127
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:48,240
It's kind of depressing actually,
but it makes the grocery store at 2:00

1128
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,620
AM a lot better,
you know,

1129
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:53,520
because you're just walking around and 
there were some porn chick has wasted.

1130
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,870
Try and get cantaloupes.
It's way worse when you have kids.

1131
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:00,960
Dude,
and I bet I have a hard time beating off

1132
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:02,490
to porn these days.
Yeah,

1133
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,430
I have to shut off the compassionate 
part of my brain.

1134
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,180
Really Compassionate part of my brain 
months ago.

1135
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,430
Okay.
What if this is my daughter with,

1136
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,220
you know,
my daughter was doing this and guys were

1137
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,310
holding her eyelids open and judges and 
inner eyeball,

1138
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,360
you know,
I've watched that the other day and I'm 

1139
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:22,360
like,
what the fuck?

1140
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:22,740
Someone's baby.
Someone's a little baby girl.

1141
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,110
You know,
someone's fucking her mouth like that.

1142
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,180
Maybe she likes it,
you know,

1143
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,520
some girls do like that.
So you can't,

1144
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,300
can't say always that it's terrible,
but you know for a chances are if you're

1145
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:38,301
getting pounded in a porno film,
that's not really what you want to be 

1146
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:38,301
doing.

1147
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:41,420
You should try to figure out something 
else that you can masturbate to like 

1148
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,000
start like getting attracted to 
something on purpose to try to.

1149
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,840
Someone's going to come up with anime 
porn.

1150
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,860
Yeah.
It would just go over some fucking 

1151
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:48,860
awesome CGI,
you know,

1152
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:48,960
use the quick for engine.
Yeah.

1153
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,790
You know,
once it gets to the point where um,

1154
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,960
pornography can be artificially created,
then it'd be way better.

1155
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:03,060
It was Karma Free Porn.
Today's a day that doc set the time 

1156
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,020
machine to go back to and back to the 
future.

1157
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:04,800
But really?
Yeah.

1158
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,120
Wow.
That's hilarious.

1159
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,000
How do you know that?
Somebody tweeted it earlier today.

1160
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,190
I didn't research it,
so it might be fake.

1161
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,920
Could you imagine if they really do 
invent a time machine one day?

1162
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,040
Because the real thing about time 
machines that people aren't aware of,

1163
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:20,790
there's scientists that actually tried 
to like study time travel and whether or

1164
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:22,860
not there's a guy's fucking awesome 
story.

1165
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,240
His name is Ronald Malate.
Dr Ronald Mouth,

1166
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,970
I believe from Connecticut.
See if you google that shit.

1167
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,420
See if that's his name.
But anyway,

1168
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:33,270
the guy has a fantastic story.
He's,

1169
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,300
he's like the leading scientists when it
comes to a theoretical models for time 

1170
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:41,080
trap.
What was his name?

1171
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:46,030
Ronald Malate from I believe University 
of Connecticut and he.

1172
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,330
He has like a working model yet is 
Ronald Mallon.

1173
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,420
He has a working model of a m,
a l,

1174
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:53,760
l e t,
t or one,

1175
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,570
one tier two t's,
tt.

1176
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,940
Who else?
M a l l e t,

1177
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,280
t look him up on Google and there's some
videos about him,

1178
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,250
but his dad died.
It's a crazy story.

1179
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:08,440
His Dad died when he was a kid and he 
was so hurt.

1180
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:11,260
He loved his father and his whole,
his photos of him and his father and his

1181
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:14,710
father smile and he smiled.
He was so close to his father.

1182
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:19,711
When his father died,
it crushed him and so he dedicated his 

1183
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,070
life to creating a time machine.

1184
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:25,210
He dedicated his life to creating a time
machine so that he could go back in time

1185
00:48:25,211 --> 00:48:28,750
and save his father so his father would 
be with him again.

1186
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,900
So that was the entire focus of his life
and he got to a certain point where he 

1187
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,270
realized that you can someday it is 
possible to travel back in time,

1188
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,810
but it's not something that you're going
to be able to go back to any point in 

1189
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:47,671
history.
You're only going to be able to go back 

1190
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:47,671
in time to the moment that the first 
time machine was invented.

1191
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,850
So what we'll be able to be possible is 
you will be able to.

1192
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,190
The moment there is a time machine 
invented,

1193
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,290
you'll that day.
From that day on,

1194
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,450
you'll be able to go to any point in 
history that you want.

1195
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,220
So you can go to,
you know,

1196
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,860
assuming there's human beings around,
you know,

1197
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,250
assuming the world hasn't been hit by 
another planet or some crazy shit,

1198
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,340
you'll be able to go to 1 million years 
from now.

1199
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,380
Let's see what the world looks like 1 
million years from now.

1200
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,530
Because there will be time machines 
functional back then or in that feature.

1201
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,530
But the problem is then,
this is the,

1202
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:22,770
this is all theoretical,
but the problem is that any moment in 

1203
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,330
time could also go back to the moment,
the first time she was invented.

1204
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,990
So if you can travel back in time from 
any moment in time,

1205
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:31,360
that's like millions of years,
in fact,

1206
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,430
infinite.
If people are still alive,

1207
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:38,490
have of time of years of people going 
back to the moment of the first time 

1208
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:42,121
machine being invented.
So it's literally like the whole notion 

1209
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:43,870
of time gets broken,
you know,

1210
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,880
there's no,
there's no real future.

1211
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:50,881
It all kind of happens all at once.
So literally fucks with the entire 

1212
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:55,471
fabric of the universe.
Everything can come back to the moment 

1213
00:49:55,471 --> 00:49:55,471
that the first time machine was 
invented.

1214
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,360
It like breaks everything.
So this is like real shit.

1215
00:49:58,361 --> 00:50:03,361
They're working on like this.
This guy is like really convinced that 

1216
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:03,430
this is a possible thing.
That's craziness.

1217
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,800
Here's something else I had back to the 
future three.

1218
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:11,860
If you look at the very end of the movie
when dox has his kids and he's like 

1219
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,980
telling like cmit everything's going to 
be good,

1220
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:14,810
you know,
look at one of the kids,

1221
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,870
the kids starts going like this,
like come here or put something in my 

1222
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,980
hand and then he points to his dick what
it is.

1223
00:50:21,981 --> 00:50:25,580
So ridiculous and just got snuck through
somehow it snuck through.

1224
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,970
But I'm talking about like a six old to

1225
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,830
people were so stupid back then.
They didn't even know.

1226
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,930
So yeah.
You could find on youtube,

1227
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:35,990
like back to the future three points to 
package.

1228
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,300
Is that one of those movies that you go 
watch it today and it would disappoint 

1229
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:41,300
the shit out of?
Yeah.

1230
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:41,420
Yeah.
Not so good.

1231
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,540
Not so good.
I mean I saw the first one the other day

1232
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,810
and it was okay,
but then I saw the third one was just so

1233
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,500
dumb.
I didn't even want to watch it.

1234
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:50,110
Yeah,
man,

1235
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,450
the evolution of movies has been pretty 
fucking pretty obvious.

1236
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,660
The evolution of what we accept,
you know?

1237
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:01,750
Yeah.
Like people talk about avatar being 

1238
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,840
silly and ridiculous,
but still you see toy story three yet?

1239
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,010
No,
I heard it's awesome,

1240
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,860
isn't it?
Are the best.

1241
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,410
All that animation stuff,
which just freaks me the fuck out.

1242
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,440
I was reading and wired there.
There's some insane amount of time for 

1243
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,460
like every frame for as far as like,
um,

1244
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,320
rendering something like seven our 
fucking time for each frame to render.

1245
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,720
Is that insane?
Which movie though?

1246
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:25,700
This campaign now.
Really?

1247
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:26,870
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1248
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,700
Hmm.
That seems like it would be better than 

1249
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,830
I could go into the living room and go 
get that a,

1250
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,300
that magazine,
but I don't know exactly where it is and

1251
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:40,980
I don't want to get up.
But the idea is that it's still,

1252
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,370
even to this day,
it's very difficult to do the whole,

1253
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:46,200
um,
even if my timeframe is wrong,

1254
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:51,590
the whole.
Why don't you just go look under wired 

1255
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,430
pixar,
Pixar,

1256
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,740
not pixel.
Um,

1257
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,600
but it's,
it's still not quite there yet as far as

1258
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:05,610
like the technology that's going to 
exist one day where you can create 

1259
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,130
instant artificial people.
You know,

1260
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:12,140
you remember like the editing that 
you're doing right now just with final 

1261
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,190
cut on just doing on a regular home 
computer.

1262
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:19,210
An apple mean that this is the kind of 
shit that 10 years ago it was like 

1263
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,810
fucking dreaming.
You're dreaming bitch.

1264
00:52:21,811 --> 00:52:25,530
Like you're gonna what you're going to 
be able to edit and how fast is it gonna

1265
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,290
render we're going to put shit together.
It's that easy.

1266
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,940
Twenty years ago.
Science fiction,

1267
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,470
right?
Twenty years ago,

1268
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,240
science fiction,
30 years ago,

1269
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,570
super crazy.
Science fiction.

1270
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:37,520
It's like ridiculous.
You're talking,

1271
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,560
you're talking about something that's 
just like people would look at in the 

1272
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:42,560
movies and go,
wow,

1273
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,100
you know,
like minority report type shit.

1274
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:49,100
Yeah.
Well they make it look like you can do 

1275
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,391
it now,
but it really is not going to exist for 

1276
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:50,391
another 100 years or so.
What did you say?

1277
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:51,330
How many hours?
I think they said seven.

1278
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:51,960
Yeah,
that's what they.

1279
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,520
Just seven hours.
Seven hours.

1280
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,830
Seven hours per pixel.
What the fuck,

1281
00:52:55,831 --> 00:53:00,831
man?
That's all I got super computer to 

1282
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:00,831
write.
I don't think it was like A.

1283
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:00,831
I'm sure they use.
Yeah,

1284
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:03,330
a huge cloud of computers.
Definitely.

1285
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,390
That's ridiculous.
Those movies took a lot of fucking time,

1286
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,250
but God damn,
they're cool as fuck.

1287
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:12,150
So 77 hours now.
So in 10 years,

1288
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,240
that means we could do pixar movies on 
her phone.

1289
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,190
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1290
00:53:17,191 --> 00:53:18,200
That's inevitable,
right?

1291
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,350
It's going to be awesome.
Hey Dude,

1292
00:53:19,351 --> 00:53:20,790
check off toy story 80.
Huh?

1293
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:23,130
If they don't break the universe before 
then.

1294
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,300
Yeah.
All right.

1295
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:25,140
That's my latest.

1296
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,570
The human beings created the big bang.
I've been talking about on that stage.

1297
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,680
I think that's what we're doing.
I think that's.

1298
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,590
I think that's why the big,
I think 14,

1299
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,350
14 billion years ago plus was the big 
bang.

1300
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:42,650
I think it was a lonely dude in his 
basement and figured out a way to break 

1301
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,621
the universe and they had a switch and 
they wanted to see what happened and 

1302
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:45,621
they clicked it and the whole thing,
you just want to.

1303
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,120
I think that's what happens.
And then,

1304
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,980
and then you know,
people get curious and we developed to a

1305
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:55,470
certain point in time where we repeat 
the process.

1306
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,460
Isn't that possible?
I mean,

1307
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:01,410
nobody knows what the fuck created the 
Big Bang,

1308
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:06,411
right?
But when you see scientists working on 

1309
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:09,081
shit like the large Hadron collider,
the large Hadron collider is this crazy 

1310
00:54:09,081 --> 00:54:13,791
experiment that they're participating 
right now in Europe where they've got 

1311
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:17,331
this 22 kilometer long machine and it 
spins these,

1312
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:22,371
Adam's around and collides them.
It's just just slightly slower than the 

1313
00:54:22,371 --> 00:54:25,731
speed of light and they're trying to 
recreate a thing called the Higgs Boson 

1314
00:54:25,731 --> 00:54:29,601
particle.
Now they believe there's actually five 

1315
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:30,780
different higgs boson particles are 
trying to figure out like what,

1316
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:35,810
what existed.
They call it the God particle for lack 

1317
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,631
of a better word.
And it's what existed just a 

1318
00:54:38,631 --> 00:54:38,631
millisecond,
you know,

1319
00:54:38,631 --> 00:54:39,810
a fraction of a millisecond evening,
uh,

1320
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,960
right after the big bang.
So when they get that,

1321
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,020
when they figured out how to do that,
and if they do recreate the Higgs Boson 

1322
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:48,020
and if they do really,
you know,

1323
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,020
find out it's not just a theoretical 
particle,

1324
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:49,620
but it's real.

1325
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,420
When they do that,
they're not going to stop there.

1326
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,400
But I have stop there.
They're got to keep going.

1327
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,700
They're going to the what's the next 
thing this is they got 10,000

1328
00:54:56,701 --> 00:55:01,701
scientists working on that.
This is the biggest project in 

1329
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:03,330
scientific history and it has nothing to
do with making our lives better.

1330
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,860
Technology at one point in time was all 
about making your life better.

1331
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,480
Technology was about,
you know,

1332
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:14,481
hey,
we need to get water and we don't want 

1333
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:14,481
to,
you know,

1334
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:17,150
just have to drink it out of the river 
every time we would need to get it and 

1335
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:17,150
bring it back to camp.
What do we do?

1336
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:21,420
We figured out how to make a jug.
That's technology technology today.

1337
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:26,660
The Shit like the Higgs Boson particle 
shaped like the large Hadron collider 

1338
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:26,910
shit.
Like making time machines.

1339
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:30,180
Like what are you doing?
Like what the fuck are you doing?

1340
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,360
You're not fixing the hole in the ground
and the Gulf that's making the oil 

1341
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,230
polar.
Shouldn't they pull all the scientists 

1342
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:39,230
off everything and go,
okay,

1343
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,140
we got to fix this before the whole 
ocean gets poisoned.

1344
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:41,640
I've always wondered why they don't do 
that.

1345
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:44,460
Anyway,
so with cancer it's just like,

1346
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:49,461
all right guys,
we're going to take all the sciences 

1347
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:50,150
that wants to cancer one year.
Do it.

1348
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:55,850
You know,
these guys aren't experts in their 

1349
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:55,850
fields.
Obviously.

1350
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:55,850
You mean I can't know everything about 
everything.

1351
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,060
It's a silly concept.
I mean what I'm saying,

1352
00:55:57,061 --> 00:56:02,061
but it would be great if they took all 
the top scientists from all the 

1353
00:56:02,061 --> 00:56:06,381
different disciplines that would be 
involved and they immediately allocated 

1354
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:08,370
funds to get them to work on the project
instantly and just the government stuff.

1355
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,110
I mean I'm not in favor of the 
government stepping in,

1356
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:13,740
but in this case I would say this is not
just a natural disaster.

1357
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:18,741
This is a fucking catastrophic disaster 
where apocalyptic disaster where they 

1358
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:20,580
need to step in and do something about 
this immediately.

1359
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,040
They need to like impose like almost 
like a martial law type of a thing.

1360
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,820
Take over the whole,
you know,

1361
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,750
but then again,
who's going to be good that's doing that

1362
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:30,760
for the government.
The government would have to involve the

1363
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:33,910
private sector and the private sector 
would try to make a lot of money from it

1364
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:36,190
and would try to fuck people over and it
would be a big scandal.

1365
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:38,800
It'd be like Halliburton and they'd find
out billions of dollars are missing from

1366
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:41,680
the whatever.
My fucking idea sucks.

1367
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,770
You see that baby and China.
I was born with a second food.

1368
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:48,440
I did and I didn't want to look.
I saw it and I shut it off.

1369
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,000
That shit depresses the fuck out of 
them.

1370
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,540
It's pretty amazing.
Now it's,

1371
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,450
I mean it's a second face.
It kind of looks like,

1372
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,210
what does that movie a Phantom of the 
opera or whatever,

1373
00:56:58,510 --> 00:56:59,980
but it's.
I mean,

1374
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,730
did you say there were gonna be able to 
fix the kid or I'll do it.

1375
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:05,560
I didn't really depresses the shit out 
of me.

1376
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:10,750
Just like the one that I saw the other 
day where there was a baby that was 

1377
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:10,750
born.
It was like a fish baby,

1378
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,970
like skin had this very strange disease.
That shit so depressing to me,

1379
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:16,840
man.
You know,

1380
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:21,930
fucked at birth and especially man,
it's depressing when you find out that 

1381
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,520
it's due to birth defects because of 
chemicals,

1382
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,680
people that worked at factories and you 
know,

1383
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,710
people that were given chemicals they 
shouldn't have been given while they 

1384
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:31,710
were pregnant.
And Man,

1385
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,490
China,
China's a tricky place right now.

1386
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:38,491
Man.
China has some of the most polluted 

1387
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:40,201
cities in the world.
Have you ever seen the videos on that 

1388
00:57:40,201 --> 00:57:42,540
you're seeing is that the same wherever 
there are dropping like our old 

1389
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:42,670
computers and cell phones are all going 
there.

1390
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:44,390
Is that China?
I don't know.

1391
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,190
Do they go to China?

1392
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,420
He had that somewhere they go and it's 
just cities that are like kind of like,

1393
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:54,110
what's that wally movie with cities of 
just old computers and stuff like that.

1394
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:59,140
Let's find out where they go.
Let's find out because I never heard of 

1395
00:57:59,140 --> 00:57:59,140
that before.
No,

1396
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,590
but I do know that China has terrible 
Belushi pollution problems and there was

1397
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:06,490
one city where they showed it.
Was it a VBS DOT TV doc?

1398
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:11,790
Some doc that I watched on the most 
polluted city in the world and just one 

1399
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,991
day in this city,
just just breathing the air is like 

1400
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:17,080
smoking three packs of cigarettes a day.
Wow.

1401
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,590
So every fucking day you're there,
you're smoking three packs of cigarettes

1402
00:58:20,591 --> 00:58:22,270
a day.
The Sky was brown,

1403
00:58:22,271 --> 00:58:23,710
man.
It was crazy.

1404
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:29,070
Like you couldn't see shit like it was.
It took smog to an les nasty dude.

1405
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:34,560
When you come over,
like when you're coming from the valley 

1406
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,870
and he'd come over that hill and you see
everything brown and you can't even see 

1407
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:37,330
the fucking mountains outside of 
Pasadena.

1408
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,610
You can't see the mountains and you look
at it and you go,

1409
00:58:39,611 --> 00:58:43,870
what the fuck are we doing to the EHR?
That ain't shit compared to China,

1410
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,270
right?
China five times worse than that.

1411
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,640
It is the nuttiest shit you've ever seen
in your life.

1412
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,680
I don't know what kind of laws they 
have.

1413
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:52,210
I don't know how to get away with shit 
like that,

1414
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,660
but the factories just palm shit out.
What is this?

1415
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,450
So we have a photo.
You found the dangers of old computers.

1416
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,330
There's a computer wasteland.
Does it say what country China,

1417
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:02,410
China,
meaning Irish,

1418
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,580
China.
It's about to smash.

1419
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,200
Everybody keeps going off about how 
great the economy is in China and 

1420
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,650
China's becoming like a capitalist 
economy and you know,

1421
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,340
Chinese people are,
you know,

1422
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,380
the whole country is,
it's changing and flourishing and we 

1423
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:18,880
owe.
America owes China so much.

1424
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,160
And then you look at what China's really
doing,

1425
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,170
like con cam or a foxconn rather.

1426
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:25,670
Right?
Isn't that the name of the company?

1427
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:30,700
Foxconn.
Foxconn is where all those guys who are 

1428
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:30,700
working for apple keep killing 
themselves.

1429
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,230
They help make an iphone speaking 
enough.

1430
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,690
How do you like your new iphone?
I had to get a new one.

1431
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:36,840
Yeah?
Yeah.

1432
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,180
How to get a new one.
What happened?

1433
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,160
Wouldn't accept the SIM card.
Kept saying my.

1434
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:42,050
I didn't have a Sim card.
Oh yeah.

1435
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,520
Crazy.
I don't know what happened.

1436
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,660
It just kept doing.
It.

1437
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,580
Kept saying no Sim card,
no Sim card.

1438
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:49,760
And so finally,
eventually out to bring it back to them.

1439
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:54,860
You said you want to see live meet going
from three bars to zero service.

1440
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,360
Oh,
okay.

1441
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:58,010
This is.
This is the thing where if you touch the

1442
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:02,300
bottom,
it says it does something to show it.

1443
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,010
Okay.
If you don't know,

1444
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,100
nobody could say this man.
This fucking web cameras sucks.

1445
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,880
Bars.
You got at least you have a couple bars,

1446
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:10,330
right?
Well,

1447
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,230
just just do it and tell us what's 
happening.

1448
01:00:12,231 --> 01:00:14,540
Yeah,
it's going.

1449
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:16,370
It's going from.
I just went to 83.

1450
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,640
It was on for actually,
um,

1451
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,410
it's now two.
Oh Wow.

1452
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:27,070
And it's now going to go to one any 
second now.

1453
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,660
So just slowly drops.
Yeah.

1454
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:34,930
You know what apple says?
They say that it's an error in the 

1455
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:34,930
followings.
Wild dropped down.

1456
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:35,570
The one that's crazy that's going to go 
to no service.

1457
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:40,571
Now they say that it's a,
an error in the phones computing and 

1458
01:00:40,571 --> 01:00:44,450
that it is a,
it's not an error saying searching.

1459
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:45,680
Wow,
okay.

1460
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:50,681
Let it go now and then it'll go back up.
And so apple's trying to say that it's 

1461
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:56,081
not a real problem.
They're trying to say that what you're 

1462
01:00:56,081 --> 01:00:56,960
getting is just a more accurate 
representation of the signals.

1463
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,300
Wow.
Now it's got a signal which is whack.

1464
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,360
That doesn't make any sense because if 
they're saying what they're saying is 

1465
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:04,360
like,
if this is wrong,

1466
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,111
if you don't have three bars right now,
you actually have one bar and covering 

1467
01:01:08,111 --> 01:01:10,040
up the antenna will make it go down.
I just know it's a stupid.

1468
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:15,100
It's a stupid thing to say because okay,
so you're saying that the phone just 

1469
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,710
calculates the bars incorrectly and 
really when you touch it a certain way,

1470
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,300
then it calculates them.
Right.

1471
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,640
What do you,
what does that the truth button the fuck

1472
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:24,020
are you talking about?
You have,

1473
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:28,580
you have a button and it's a part of the
phone and if you touch it,

1474
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:30,680
it tells.
It makes the phone honest with you.

1475
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,210
That's stupid.
That's a hardware problem.

1476
01:01:32,211 --> 01:01:34,250
You cocksucker right?
It doesn't deal with the case,

1477
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:39,251
which,
which is good because I never used my 

1478
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:39,251
iphone without a case.

1479
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:39,251
Anyway.
He a signal here,

1480
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:39,320
man,
you should get.

1481
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:39,990
So yeah,
I got it.

1482
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:42,230
And when you had no signal,
that's not normal.

1483
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:47,260
Right?
But the problem is is what are they 

1484
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,931
going to really do about it?
Is this software update just going to 

1485
01:01:49,931 --> 01:01:49,931
make all the.
Everyone that just not happen,

1486
01:01:49,931 --> 01:01:52,720
you're just going to always have lower 
signal than normal.

1487
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:53,860
I don't know.
I just,

1488
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:57,050
I don't buy it.
Somebody just made up a whack excuse.

1489
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:02,140
Right?
Because if they didn't make up a whack 

1490
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,151
excuse,
they would've had to have some massive 

1491
01:02:04,151 --> 01:02:04,151
fucking recall.
Yeah.

1492
01:02:04,151 --> 01:02:07,810
People would have gone nuts.
There's class action lawsuit in the 

1493
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:07,810
works.
Yeah,

1494
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:10,200
but they said that it does.
It does it on the three g and the past.

1495
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:12,350
But I tried on my three gs.
I couldn't do it.

1496
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:16,130
I try as video online though top.
Oh really?

1497
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,650
I couldn't do it.
Maybe they broke theirs or something.

1498
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,370
Maybe it was older models.

1499
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:21,960
Yeah.
Oh Man.

1500
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:27,350
Too stupid way to deal with the issue.
They'll tell people they have to buy a 

1501
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:30,771
bumper,
especially when you're selling poppers 

1502
01:02:30,771 --> 01:02:32,481
for 30 bucks,
which is kind of Douchey in and of 

1503
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:32,481
itself.
You know,

1504
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:33,900
like why?
How come if I drop it,

1505
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:34,910
it's fucked.
Right.

1506
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,920
So you get that bump,
so you give me this little thing to put 

1507
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:39,920
around it.
Oh,

1508
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,500
how much does this little thing?
30 bucks.

1509
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:44,520
This is 30 bucks and only apple makes it
and it should have came with a fucking.

1510
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:46,860
You got a blackberry the other day.
I came with a leather case.

1511
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,340
I can't get a little piece of rubber,
you know,

1512
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:54,410
so I went to best buy and I bought two 
of the only cases that best buy sells,

1513
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,490
you know,
that covered the back,

1514
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,180
right.
So,

1515
01:02:57,181 --> 01:03:02,181
uh,
the first one I put on it was so tight 

1516
01:03:02,181 --> 01:03:05,190
and poorly made,
I think it was Belkin that the top 

1517
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,490
button just automatically was always 
pushed down.

1518
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,800
So it was just resetting my phone over 
and over.

1519
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,920
So I had a second one that was going to 
give to you and I opened that one and 

1520
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:12,920
tried it again.
Same thing.

1521
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:16,551
Went Online,
found out that's a problem with the 

1522
01:03:16,551 --> 01:03:18,171
case.
So then I bought this other one from 

1523
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:19,290
griffith that had a,
a plastic back to it.

1524
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,720
Uh,
and every time you took a photo it would

1525
01:03:21,721 --> 01:03:25,080
flash and hit the plastic and flashback 
into the camera.

1526
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:28,200
And every photo look like shit.
I went back online.

1527
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:33,290
Same exact thing across the board.
So the only case we can get right now is

1528
01:03:33,871 --> 01:03:36,600
this one that will protect you.
Fix that.

1529
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:39,030
How do they not have cases for an 
iphone?

1530
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:39,930
Come on.
Apple.

1531
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,490
We were one.
Alright.

1532
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,590
So if I break this,
you're going to replace the back because

1533
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:46,800
there's no other fucking case.
What are and what is the deal with this?

1534
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,660
This glass on the back.
Why do you have glass on the floor?

1535
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,380
Reception issues means looking at what 
it is.

1536
01:03:52,381 --> 01:03:53,520
Yeah,
it's what it's supposed to be for.

1537
01:03:53,521 --> 01:03:55,110
It's supposed to be for better 
reception.

1538
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,250
Wow.
It mean,

1539
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:57,870
come on.
When you're carrying a piece of glass in

1540
01:03:57,871 --> 01:03:59,190
your pocket,
what are the odds?

1541
01:03:59,191 --> 01:04:04,191
Are things going to break and stab your 
fucking like decorating for the first 

1542
01:04:04,191 --> 01:04:08,091
person to sit on the back of their phone
and get us up there ass hole and they 

1543
01:04:08,091 --> 01:04:11,520
die.
What do you think a month to imagine 

1544
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,881
that?
That's how he died on an iphone at went 

1545
01:04:13,881 --> 01:04:14,760
up your ass and that killed you.
Yeah.

1546
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:18,390
What was that guy that used to the 30 
ways to die or whatever.

1547
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:23,391
Ninety nine ways to die.
He put glass things up his ass and sat 

1548
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:24,300
on them.
Remember he had this fetish of putting a

1549
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:25,980
glass,
whatever.

1550
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,180
That was a bad one of those episodes.
Yeah.

1551
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:29,280
Really?
Yeah.

1552
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:32,460
That shows disturbing as fuck.
Like different people have died.

1553
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,860
Spike's doing good with their shows.
That's a good one.

1554
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,380
Yeah.
That's a good short attention span show.

1555
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:42,650
He just slip in and you know,
anytime you're flipping through the 

1556
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:42,930
channels and they'll start like a real 
kind of like a,

1557
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:44,460
um,
what's the word?

1558
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:48,040
Just a hokey sort of a reenactment,
you know,

1559
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:53,041
where it's,
there's like a certain amount of humor 

1560
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:53,041
to it,
you know,

1561
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:53,041
and they know what they're going to show
you a fucked up way.

1562
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:55,260
Somebody died.
It's kind of creepy,

1563
01:04:55,590 --> 01:05:00,590
but it's interesting to me because then 
I think about all these have that extra 

1564
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:01,770
thought every time you know,
I want to shove something up my ass.

1565
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,460
I know I might die from it,
you know,

1566
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:05,850
you know,
you know what I do know.

1567
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,330
I do know it's a hard urge to resist 
shoving your ass.

1568
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,380
Sometimes it just overcomes you or,
or just crossing the street with my eyes

1569
01:05:13,381 --> 01:05:13,980
closed,
you know,

1570
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:16,680
whatever you've seen oriented showed me 
one guy in one cup,

1571
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:17,800
didn't you?
Somebody did

1572
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,360
one guy,
one cup.

1573
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:22,960
I think you showed it to me.
I don't look for those things anymore.

1574
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,530
That was the one where the guy put a jar
up his asshole.

1575
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:31,620
Right.
And then he sat down and his asshole 

1576
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:34,620
crushed the jar and chunks of glass and 
blood start falling out of this guy's 

1577
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:37,680
body and he doesn't even freak out.
That's the most disturbing part of.

1578
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:41,230
But I still don't know if I believe 
everything anymore.

1579
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,310
Oh,
I believe that one.

1580
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,590
I don't know if that's a fake glass.
Even if that's not fake.

1581
01:05:45,591 --> 01:05:48,970
Someone needs a Goddamn Academy award.
Bme Pan Olympics was fake.

1582
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,600
No,
it's not.

1583
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:52,000
A lot of that is not fake.
It's all fake.

1584
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:55,900
People say it's fake.
I don't believe that that knows the most

1585
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:56,940
about.
I have it on my wife's side.

1586
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:58,470
Parts of that were real.
It wasn't that one.

1587
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:00,850
It wasn't one of them to cut his finger 
off.

1588
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,550
Huh?
Wasn't that the BME?

1589
01:06:02,551 --> 01:06:02,850
No,
no,

1590
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,630
no.
The Olympics where they're just chopping

1591
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:06,490
their balls off and stuff like that.
I read to me,

1592
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:07,510
man,
they're all the same.

1593
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:11,220
Yeah,
they're all the.

1594
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,590
All the.
All the violence go together.

1595
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,600
I know there's one word got cut his 
finger off where it's absolutely real 

1596
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:18,600
yet.
I'm sure that might be real.

1597
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,720
There's fucking crazy guy with the jar 
up his ass.

1598
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:21,490
Real dude.
It's really pretty.

1599
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:22,840
Pretty obvious.
It's real.

1600
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:28,380
You believe we don't chase them nasty.
I don't know what the fuck happened to 

1601
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:33,271
that dude when he was a kid that made 
them want to shove bottles up his 

1602
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:35,090
asshole and having a crush inside of 
them and then drop out.

1603
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,510
What happened?
What is it?

1604
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,270
Lindsay Lohan's.
Mom.

1605
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,940
Do you think that will do it?
Fuck yeah.

1606
01:06:42,941 --> 01:06:47,941
Can Imagine Lindsay Lohan as your mom 
and fucking that dude from Jack Ass 

1607
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:47,941
Steevo as your dad.

1608
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,500
Do you think she can get pregnant?
Uh,

1609
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,720
no.
She's probably so good.

1610
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:58,110
Like you said,
we just saw that she was 24 I thought 

1611
01:06:58,110 --> 01:06:58,110
for sure.
She was like over 30.

1612
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,540
I forgot all about.
Yeah.

1613
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,820
I don't know.
I wonder if I could.

1614
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:06,010
Hard action man that ships out there 
doing it every night.

1615
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,710
Yeah,
you're the one that told me that she got

1616
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:13,800
a tooth pulled just so she'd get back on
Vicodin so closely when she got that 

1617
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,640
scrapbook brace it on or whatever it's 
called,

1618
01:07:15,641 --> 01:07:20,641
that she immediately had a dentist's 
appointment the next day that was 

1619
01:07:20,641 --> 01:07:21,810
supposedly priorly,
you know,

1620
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,710
uh,
prior to this,

1621
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:28,711
whatever.
And she had a tooth pulled or she had 

1622
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:28,711
something she had done,
but it was like,

1623
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:32,880
oh,
now she's allowed to have [inaudible] 

1624
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:32,880
and that's really,
that's nice for her.

1625
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,170
So.
So she's got this crazy bracelet on,

1626
01:07:35,171 --> 01:07:37,690
so to stay sober and the dentist gives 
her,

1627
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,080
first of all,
she don't need to get fucking Viking and

1628
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:42,850
I've had teeth pulled.

1629
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,100
I've had shit happen.
You just deal with it.

1630
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,750
It's not that bad.
I have a knee surgery.

1631
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:51,751
They didn't take pain medication.
I took violin when I had my first acl 

1632
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:53,230
reconstruction and made me feel so 
stupid.

1633
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:58,120
It just made me feel so dumb and I sold 
them some dude at the pool hall.

1634
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,970
Let's do named Jeff.
You did not do that?

1635
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,100
Yes.
You sell them.

1636
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,330
I sold them to Jeff and jeff sold them 
all throughout the pool.

1637
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,650
People Gobble those and ends up.
They love him.

1638
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:14,430
I had a friend who was a guitarist.
He used to say that it made him more 

1639
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:14,430
creative.
What?

1640
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:15,650
That's the opposite effect it does to 
mean to me.

1641
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:17,590
It makes me feel fucking useless.
And Dom,

1642
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,600
that's all it does,
but I think everybody's brain is 

1643
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:22,600
working,
working differently.

1644
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:22,640
Men,
I mean slightly.

1645
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:25,910
I think we all have different levels of 
different chemicals and different.

1646
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:31,010
You know,
his music was probably fucking retarded 

1647
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:31,010
then.
Well,

1648
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:31,010
no,
he was.

1649
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:35,070
No,
he was a classical guitarist who is 

1650
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,070
really good.
He was like,

1651
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,070
he wouldn't like competitions shit.
It was fucking bad ass.

1652
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:38,690
Worst song ever.
Competition.

1653
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:43,810
No Man.
He would play songs that already 

1654
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:43,810
existed,
you know,

1655
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:45,290
like Spanish Franca songs,
that kind of Shit.

1656
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:50,291
He was just,
he's a brilliant guitarist and he said 

1657
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:50,291
we'd take vodka and it would make them 
more creative.

1658
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,320
I don't know,
but you know,

1659
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:53,990
everybody's brains.
He's a fucking crazy dude.

1660
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:56,600
Who was a former,
a taekwondo champion,

1661
01:08:56,601 --> 01:09:00,650
my friend Dimitri,
and he was a big fucking burly,

1662
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:04,700
manly giant dude from the Ukraine,
you know,

1663
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:09,230
his family's a bunch of fucking savages,
much of a Russian fucking animals,

1664
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:14,620
and maybe the Vicodin just helped calm 
his inner monkey enough so that he 

1665
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,380
could.
He could tune into his creative spirit,

1666
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,240
you know?

1667
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:18,200
Yeah.
Everyone's different,

1668
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,540
right?
This dude's the only dude that I've ever

1669
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:25,541
talked to that said vicodins made them 
creative as I could easily have been 

1670
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:25,541
that,
you know,

1671
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:26,720
everybody's got their own fucking thing,
man.

1672
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:31,780
I mean,
how many people have you come across 

1673
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:31,780
where you go,
this guy is just broken.

1674
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:31,780
His brain's just not wired,
right?

1675
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:36,761
His body's not wired right.
He just got the wrong levels of all 

1676
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:38,020
kinds of shit when he was in the womb.
Totally.

1677
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,640
Portland,
and that's our message for Lindsey.

1678
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:41,870
Hang in there,
girl.

1679
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:47,410
You could.
You are going to get out in three 

1680
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:49,301
months.
And I think that's when little wayne 

1681
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:50,070
gets out to and you can get together and
make a fucking bad ass ed.

1682
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,740
How about that?
That's brock says,

1683
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:56,741
put your underwear on.
How about I've Lindsay starts fucking 

1684
01:09:56,741 --> 01:09:57,820
rapping while she's in the,
in the pokey and comes out like some bad

1685
01:09:57,821 --> 01:09:58,880
ass bitch rapper.

1686
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:02,030
He's going to get fucking laid so much.
It's probably,

1687
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,550
she's probably gonna be in jail.
Yeah,

1688
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,730
she's probably just gonna fuck her in 
jail too.

1689
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,350
She's in heaven.
She's going to come out with.

1690
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:09,920
Has Been Hell.
Yes she is.

1691
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:12,080
I didn't know this.
What she did a date.

1692
01:10:12,081 --> 01:10:16,060
Samantha Ronson or whatever.
Really Sweet Dj.

1693
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:19,440
You know Djs.
I know San Francisco.

1694
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:24,450
One Dj and I don't know why I know him 
because everybody always talks about 

1695
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:24,450
that guy.
Tsl.

1696
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:24,560
Craig,
Bro.

1697
01:10:24,561 --> 01:10:26,420
Sorry.
One of the dudes who works for the UFC.

1698
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:27,830
I think he was the one who was telling 
me about this.

1699
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:30,650
The guy sells out these gigantic fucking
stadiums.

1700
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,060
Might've been craig.
I'm not sure,

1701
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,760
but he's like this huge,
huge,

1702
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:39,820
huge fucking dj where he sells out like 
just gigantic events all over the world.

1703
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:43,280
They come to see this guy do dj and he 
makes his own electronic music.

1704
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,690
That's huge.
I love it.

1705
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:47,570
But how do you know?
How do you find out about these guys?

1706
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:50,390
Used to do my space,
but now penn,

1707
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:51,860
Pandora,
Pandora.

1708
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,230
Yeah,
just putting it in my space.

1709
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:57,000
If you want to start off slow,
just put in fatboy slim and they make it

1710
01:10:57,001 --> 01:10:59,210
a radio station based off that or 
something like that.

1711
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:01,790
And we talked about this.
Pandora is pretty bad ass.

1712
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,790
I like the idea of creating your own 
radio station.

1713
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:07,550
[inaudible] good stuff.
So Brock,

1714
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,940
brock Lesnar and Shankar one.
That was cool.

1715
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,980
Raisie Brian was there on the

1716
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,130
floor.
What?

1717
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,940
I'm so glad they did.
Oh yeah.

1718
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:21,630
Rock is one of those people that they 
don't have to worry about stopping.

1719
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:24,090
It's going to take a few trains into 
that.

1720
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:26,980
It really stopped the guy.
So I'm glad that means you know,

1721
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:28,260
I mean,
you know,

1722
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,840
trains to the head.
But I mean he,

1723
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,820
he,
they didn't stop it so I was happy.

1724
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I was just,
I was so scared they're going to stop 

1725
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,000
it.
Yeah.

1726
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,190
Well you know,
it looked like they were gonna stop it.

1727
01:11:38,191 --> 01:11:43,191
I mean,
he was just covering up and Shankar was 

1728
01:11:43,191 --> 01:11:45,561
bombing on them and props to referee 
Josh Rosenthal because it wasn't for 

1729
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:45,561
Josh Rosenthal,
the,

1730
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:50,370
you know,
someone easily could have pulled the 

1731
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:52,341
trigger earlier.
Right now there's a few guys that I 

1732
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,070
wouldn't have trusted in that situation,
but Josh saw that he was okay.

1733
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:58,071
He was going to get through it and you 
saw the change punches were coming 

1734
01:11:58,071 --> 01:11:58,560
slower and slower and Shane,
unfortunately it just blew his wad.

1735
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:59,290
He,
um,

1736
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,990
you know,
he had an adrenaline dump,

1737
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:03,770
I'm sure the excitement of the fact that
he had a,

1738
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:06,300
the champ hurting on his back and that 
he was on top and he's like,

1739
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:11,301
this is over,
this fucking thing is over and it's 

1740
01:12:11,301 --> 01:12:11,301
pounded and pounded on Panama.
And then also has like,

1741
01:12:11,301 --> 01:12:15,351
fuck,
there's two minutes left to go in this 

1742
01:12:15,351 --> 01:12:15,351
round,
you know?

1743
01:12:15,351 --> 01:12:15,570
And then he's got to keep going.
And by the end of those two minutes,

1744
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,600
there was nothing left.
He got back to his corner and literally 

1745
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,571
could barely get up.
His legs were barely walking and he was 

1746
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:27,471
fucked.
He said his legs seized up and he said 

1747
01:12:27,471 --> 01:12:27,510
he just went out there and he tried to 
do whatever he could,

1748
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:31,890
but his body just was not responding.
He just completely adrenaline dumped and

1749
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:35,200
completely blew out all of his energy.
But God damn does.

1750
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,160
He hit him hard before that.
Holy Shit.

1751
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:41,640
That fucking Shankar when can punch.
He had so hard.

1752
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:44,730
He's so big,
but I think he's too big.

1753
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,900
I think maybe like because he,
he had to lose 17 pounds to make a,

1754
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,670
to 65,
so he's,

1755
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:54,060
you know,
walking in like at like somewhere around

1756
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:55,070
two 80 ish,
you know,

1757
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,740
on the day of the fight.
So I think that might be too big for his

1758
01:12:58,741 --> 01:12:59,660
frame.
You know,

1759
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,670
I think maybe he might be better off if 
he was like 2:50,

1760
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,110
you know,
just a little lighter.

1761
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:09,111
But with more endurance,
his punches are still going to be 

1762
01:13:09,111 --> 01:13:11,871
ridiculously powerful.
Nobody could stand up to the way that 

1763
01:13:11,871 --> 01:13:11,910
guy hits his punches will still be 
ridiculously powerful,

1764
01:13:11,911 --> 01:13:14,500
but he'll have a little bit more cardio.
You know,

1765
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,740
brock is just physically a bigger guy.
Man.

1766
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:21,480
Brock Brock really has a 270 pound man's
body means so wide.

1767
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,720
He's just a big giant freak.
Carlin's not as wide,

1768
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:29,750
you know,
he's still biggest fuck a big giant 

1769
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:29,750
hands and shit,
but you know,

1770
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,680
I think brock maybe can carry a little 
bit more weight naturally.

1771
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:35,970
Then Shane can and these guys when they,
when they train really hard with weights

1772
01:13:35,971 --> 01:13:37,680
and power lifting and shit like that.
Yeah.

1773
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:42,681
It makes you stronger.
It gives you a lot more muscle and that 

1774
01:13:42,681 --> 01:13:43,380
muscle got to get fed.
It's going to get fed by blood,

1775
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:46,700
but goddamn it was exciting as fuck 
before it's for.

1776
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:48,920
It was over.
How does you still have his mouthpiece?

1777
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:51,210
Everything in his mouth.
Put it in yet.

1778
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,960
Tasted tasted the taste of a warrior.
It's right over there.

1779
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:58,610
He stuck it in.
My pocket was over.

1780
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,540
I said I'm gonna sell that shit on Ebay,
but I'm just going to hang onto it now.

1781
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,950
That's cool.
Fucking.

1782
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,680
I'm a fan.
A trivia moment.

1783
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,610
Plus it was a what a comeback.
When he came out for that second round,

1784
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,470
his hands were up high and like,
you know,

1785
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:12,550
you just knew this motherfucker's not 
going away.

1786
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:17,730
He got hit with some bombs and he was 
still there and still in really good 

1787
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:18,070
shape and that was really the big 
difference.

1788
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,280
He took shane down,
gotten Shane's half card passed,

1789
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:26,490
got on top of him,
got him in an arm triangle and put them 

1790
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:27,310
to sleep.
It was fucking sweet or put them to tap.

1791
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:32,490
He would've gone to sleep.
He really cranked it tight and brock is 

1792
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:32,490
so gigantic.
You see,

1793
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:34,840
they also call it a side joke.
There's two different versions of it.

1794
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:39,870
There's one like this,
you do it like this and that's why it's 

1795
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:39,870
called an arm triangle,
but the way brock did,

1796
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:44,791
I think he did it with a gable grip 
where you do it like this where it's 

1797
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:44,791
more,
it's really more of a side choke,

1798
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:49,350
but brock is so big and so fucking 
strong that when he just crushes down 

1799
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,650
like that,
like you really don't have any options,

1800
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:51,730
man,
you're going to go to sleep.

1801
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:56,790
He just got much too much power and he's
just going to quash that whole area 

1802
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:00,811
between your arm and your neck and 
everything's going to get smushed and 

1803
01:15:00,811 --> 01:15:01,420
there's not going to be any air.
That was one of the best.

1804
01:15:01,421 --> 01:15:04,780
UFC is I think in a long time.
That was a dude.

1805
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,680
I was standing up during the fight.
It was so exciting.

1806
01:15:08,681 --> 01:15:10,930
I couldn't fucking sit down.
I stood up.

1807
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,980
That's awesome.
When,

1808
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,590
when,
when a car would hit him and you know,

1809
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:15,620
he went to the ground,
it was like,

1810
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,010
it was the whole thing.
There was so much energy in the arena.

1811
01:15:18,011 --> 01:15:21,160
It was so unbelievable.
And then when brock took him down at the

1812
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:26,160
end,
it was like the whole thing was just so 

1813
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:26,950
nice and then when they tapped like it 
was just fucking craziness,

1814
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:28,150
man.
There was so much energy.

1815
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:29,710
I stood up like three or four times.

1816
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,150
I don't do that,
man.

1817
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:36,300
That's the only fight I've ever had to 
stand up in the middle of it because it 

1818
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,911
was so crazy though.
Like as far as like sheer entertainment 

1819
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:40,030
value,
what a fucking fight.

1820
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:45,270
There was a bunch of sheer entertainment
value fights that were just off the 

1821
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:47,830
charts like Liebman and Akiyama.
Holy Shit.

1822
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,030
Yeah.
That was crazy,

1823
01:15:49,031 --> 01:15:51,760
man.
For sheer entertainment.

1824
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:55,420
That fight was better than any fucking 
movie that's ever been made.

1825
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:58,240
Has there ever been any photos of his 
face since then?

1826
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,200
Uh,
leaving.

1827
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:00,040
Yeah,
to leave.

1828
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:05,041
It's probably fine.
It probably looks today like nobody had 

1829
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:05,041
them.
Really?

1830
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:05,041
Yeah.
He's tough as fuck.

1831
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:05,650
He can take a shot.
Dude.

1832
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:07,780
He got nailed.
His legs went rubbery.

1833
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,710
He bounces backwards for a second and 
then starts walking forwards again,

1834
01:16:11,711 --> 01:16:14,770
like a fucking Zombie.
It was incredible.

1835
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:20,580
He was,
he was like literally like right out of 

1836
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:20,580
28 days later.

1837
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,020
It was fucking crazy.
He can take bombs bed.

1838
01:16:23,021 --> 01:16:25,420
He takes them right on the chin and it 
keeps going.

1839
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:29,020
The only person has been able to put 
them away as Anderson Anderson's.

1840
01:16:29,021 --> 01:16:32,320
Just way too fast.
Way Too technical.

1841
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:37,321
Way to fluid.
Just way to gifted Anderson is just on 

1842
01:16:37,321 --> 01:16:39,340
another level,
but for a lot of other people,

1843
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:40,070
man,
you know,

1844
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:44,140
it's like Arturo God,
he couldn't fight with floyd mayweather.

1845
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,300
He got in there with floyd mayweather.
He just couldn't compete.

1846
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:51,330
He couldn't compete with the style.
He couldn't compete with the technical 

1847
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:51,330
superiority,
the speed,

1848
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:53,170
the reflex is the,
the training.

1849
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,870
Everything was superior and he just got 
lit up.

1850
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,550
But when he found someone like Micky 
Ward,

1851
01:16:57,551 --> 01:16:59,110
who was like in his ball,
you know,

1852
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,700
in his,
his range,

1853
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,820
he put on some of the most incredible 
fights ever.

1854
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
It's just a matter of getting them the 
right opponent and leave and keeps 

1855
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:09,000
getting better and better.

1856
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:09,430
You know,
he,

1857
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,260
he's like,
you know,

1858
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,360
he's beating like high level guys.
You know Erin Simpson,

1859
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:16,580
the guy who beat before he beat this guy
is a bad motherfucker.

1860
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:19,210
Man.
Aaron's a serious fucking wrestler.

1861
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,650
Strongest Shit.
Incredible endurance.

1862
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,290
I mean,
he's just a.

1863
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,480
his fight with Tom Lawler.
He got nailed from pillar to post in 

1864
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,600
that first round and then the second 
round,

1865
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:34,770
you know,
he came back and he fucking started 

1866
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:37,121
taking lower down in the third round.
He came back and won that round two and 

1867
01:17:37,121 --> 01:17:39,320
wound up getting the decision when it 
looked like he was a dead band.

1868
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,680
The first round he was getting battered.
So this guy is tough as fuck.

1869
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:44,360
So when leave and put them away,
it was like,

1870
01:17:44,361 --> 01:17:45,380
wow.
Like,

1871
01:17:45,381 --> 01:17:46,550
that's,
that's strong.

1872
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,810
That's a strong statement,
you know.

1873
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,840
And then the next fight to go right from
that,

1874
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:53,650
two weeks later to fight Akiyama,
you know,

1875
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,850
hockey,
yama is a fucking bad dude.

1876
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,850
Man.
Knocked out Dennis kangs fast as fuck.

1877
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,080
Awesome.
Judo,

1878
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:01,790
real solid grappler,
you know,

1879
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:07,420
he's a good dude.
So leaving to fucking sweet winds on 

1880
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:07,420
row.
And how about that?

1881
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:09,930
Christophe Sinskey,
Stephan Bonner that,

1882
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,510
that.
That's my second favorite.

1883
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:17,540
The night attack like a man possessed.
That was odd.

1884
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:22,760
He knew that like it was do or die time.
He had lost a coleman.

1885
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,730
He had,
you know,

1886
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:26,310
had the fight with Susan.
He was,

1887
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:31,750
look,
that guy will always have a home in the 

1888
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:31,750
UFC because he's a part of the biggest 
fight in the history of the sport,

1889
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:36,491
the most important fight.
The fight that got everybody to pay 

1890
01:18:36,491 --> 01:18:38,621
attention.
The fight with him and Stephan Bonner 

1891
01:18:38,621 --> 01:18:38,650
when they were on spike TV when it was a
final,

1892
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:43,670
the ultimate fighter,
the very first season people were so 

1893
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:46,190
many people were tuning in while the 
fight was on that I think the.

1894
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,070
The amount of people viewing the fight 
by the fight,

1895
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:54,130
by the time the first card start with 
the first part of the cards started to 

1896
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:54,860
Stephan Bonner and forrest griffin,
forrest griffin fight.

1897
01:18:54,861 --> 01:18:56,780
They had it like doubled,
tripled,

1898
01:18:56,781 --> 01:18:59,870
quadrupled at one point in time.
Some insane number,

1899
01:18:59,871 --> 01:19:01,910
like six to 10 million.
They estimated,

1900
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:04,500
I forget what it was,
but like some something crazy.

1901
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:09,501
It was watching that fight when nobody 
is watching spike tv before that just 

1902
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:09,860
people were calling their friends and 
they were like,

1903
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,080
dude,
you've got to fucking turn this on.

1904
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:13,400
Turn on channel.
Whatever it is.

1905
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,680
These two guys are beating the shit out 
of each other.

1906
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:19,130
And Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonner 
had like a movie fight.

1907
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:22,400
It wasn't even real.
It was like a goddamn every which way,

1908
01:19:22,401 --> 01:19:24,240
but loose clint eastwood movie,
you know,

1909
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:29,270
it was him fighting tank Murdoch.
They beat each other all over the 

1910
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:31,100
fucking place and kept coming one after 
each other for 15 solid minutes.

1911
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,380
There'll be backed out for a second,
you know,

1912
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:37,280
so he'll always have like a strong place
in the organization.

1913
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,130
They'll will always have,
always have love for that dude.

1914
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:43,020
But he also knew that he wants to be,
you know,

1915
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,440
back in the heat at at two.
Oh five.

1916
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:50,470
He wants to be fighting up to his 
potential and he knows he's had some 

1917
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:51,920
good outings and some not so good 
outings that Jon Jones fight.

1918
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:54,050
It was a tough loss.
He had three tough losses in a row.

1919
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,830
So he stepped in like fucking wild man.
Felt like his life was on the line.

1920
01:19:57,831 --> 01:20:01,580
I was actually surprised to see him back
since the last one.

1921
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:03,680
Yeah.
But I'm glad because I always liked that

1922
01:20:03,681 --> 01:20:03,980
guy.
Well,

1923
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:04,700
you know,
he got,

1924
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:07,500
he got 'em through when Coleman got 
caught,

1925
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:10,530
man Coleman called tour.
He got caught,

1926
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:13,680
but right before coleman a coture or 
last to go to a rather.

1927
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,090
He beat her,
you know.

1928
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:20,010
So are you surprised that like Kimbo was
not given an extra shot or.

1929
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:23,220
Yes and no.
I see the point,

1930
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:26,670
you know,
really if he wasn't Kimbo you would have

1931
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:31,671
to cut them.
Matt Mitrione beat him down and it 

1932
01:20:31,671 --> 01:20:31,671
looked like he was,
you know,

1933
01:20:31,671 --> 01:20:32,580
it didn't look like he was in the right 
kind of condition.

1934
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,880
It looks like he got really tired.
His technical prowess wasn't up to the 

1935
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:41,181
level of material and material and an 
improved much more from his time on the 

1936
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:44,571
ultimate fighter.
And you also have to wonder about 

1937
01:20:44,571 --> 01:20:47,480
Kimball's body.
Kimble had some real knee problems on 

1938
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:47,910
the show and the knee problems that he 
had on the show.

1939
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:51,900
They weren't like fixable things.
It's like bone on bone type shit.

1940
01:20:51,901 --> 01:20:54,600
Like he's worn out the cartilage and one
of his knees,

1941
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,700
which means that you can't train as 
hard,

1942
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:59,110
you can't sprawl and you can't,
you know,

1943
01:20:59,111 --> 01:21:01,290
do the kind of wrestling training that 
you need to kink it.

1944
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:03,390
Your legs kicked the way you kind of 
need to get kicked,

1945
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:05,910
you know,
he's got like a pretty serious problem.

1946
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,960
That problem kept him from fighting in 
the main event or getting another,

1947
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:12,570
a shot at getting back in the heat of 
the sharp member.

1948
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,760
He got eliminated and then they offered 
it to him.

1949
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:17,980
They offered him a fight and he passed 
on the fight because it was knee.

1950
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:20,940
That's not something that gets better.
So it's like,

1951
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,870
unless he's got some sort of a cartilage
replacement surgery or I don't know what

1952
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:29,871
they're even able to do these days,
he's got a problem with that knee and 

1953
01:21:29,871 --> 01:21:33,170
that knee is going to keep them from 
being able to train the way the way a 

1954
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:34,920
GSP thiago alves trains or you know,
any of the killers.

1955
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,020
So it's,
you know,

1956
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:42,440
I don't know.
I think you can still make a lot of 

1957
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:42,440
money off the guy and the guy still 
wants to fight.

1958
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:42,810
I look at it as like,
you know,

1959
01:21:42,811 --> 01:21:47,811
butter bean,
Maryland butter bean was king of the 

1960
01:21:47,811 --> 01:21:47,811
four rounders.
You know,

1961
01:21:47,811 --> 01:21:51,230
it doesn't mean you don't use butter 
being on your car just because it's not 

1962
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:51,230
going to beat Larry Holmes,
you know,

1963
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:51,570
kept butter being out there.
Fuck it.

1964
01:21:51,571 --> 01:21:52,530
You know,
put them out there.

1965
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:53,450
It's,
it's,

1966
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:55,410
it's,
it's still entertaining.

1967
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:56,730
You know,
it's like Chris,

1968
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,250
I mean Chris Leben is,
you know,

1969
01:21:59,251 --> 01:22:01,560
he's battling it out with the best in 
the world.

1970
01:22:01,561 --> 01:22:02,790
He's beaten,
Akiyama,

1971
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:03,330
beaten,
you know,

1972
01:22:03,331 --> 01:22:05,670
he's,
he's starting to move up in the chain,

1973
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:09,000
but the end of the rainbow for him was 
always going to be Anderson Silva.

1974
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,260
You know,
Anderson.

1975
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:11,220
I mean,
look,

1976
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:14,210
anybody can beat anybody on any given 
day a zig zag.

1977
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:15,720
You run into one of Chris' lievens 
punches.

1978
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:20,930
You could be in a lot of trouble,
but technically the two are so far 

1979
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:20,930
apart,
you know,

1980
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:23,220
Anderson is in such a different level 
athletically,

1981
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,080
you know,
the,

1982
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:25,830
the,
his ease of movement,

1983
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:26,640
you know,
it's just like,

1984
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,330
what do you do?

1985
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:32,330
You're not going to cut leap and why 
would you cut them one of the most 

1986
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:32,610
entertaining fighters in the world.
So even if you can't beat Anderson,

1987
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:37,810
you've got to keep them around.
Even if he can never beat the best guy 

1988
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:37,810
in the world,
which I'm not saying he can't,

1989
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:38,280
you never know.
You never fucking know.

1990
01:22:38,281 --> 01:22:43,281
And he's improving and shit happens and 
weirder things have taken place in this 

1991
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:44,190
world.
But if even if he doesn't,

1992
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,980
if he never,
if he can never beat Anderson,

1993
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:48,720
he should still be around because he's 
awesome,

1994
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,930
you know,
he's fucking fun as shit to watch.

1995
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:57,020
So I think that about Kimbo too.
I think Kim was fun to watch and even 

1996
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:59,520
though he's not like that at the level 
that,

1997
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:04,570
you know,
a junior dos Santos is or Cain 

1998
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:04,570
Velasquez,
he's not at that level.

1999
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,860
I mean you just got to match correctly.

2000
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,000
Just just accept the fact that this guy 
is never going to be a title contender.

2001
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:12,820
And even though that's not really what 
the UFC is all about,

2002
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:15,370
UFC is the very best guys fighting the 
very best guys.

2003
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:19,840
It doesn't maybe hurt throwing a young 
gun in there with a gatekeeper.

2004
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,820
Make Kimbo a gatekeeper,
you know,

2005
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:22,610
make um,
a,

2006
01:23:22,611 --> 01:23:24,820
a guy that you test young guys with.
I think that's key.

2007
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,880
That makes it kind of interesting.
As long as kimball wants to keep doing 

2008
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,521
it.
And if he keeps losing and then you 

2009
01:23:32,521 --> 01:23:32,521
know,
it gets to a point where nobody wants to

2010
01:23:32,521 --> 01:23:33,370
see him anymore,
then maybe stop using them.

2011
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:38,950
What do you have a chance?
So what do you think Dana white would 

2012
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:39,100
say about having a UFC bar?
That was just in the middle.

2013
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:44,101
There was an octagon and every night you
just go there and there's people 

2014
01:23:44,101 --> 01:23:44,101
fighting constantly.

2015
01:23:44,101 --> 01:23:45,850
He couldn't do that.
Couldn't have that many people fighting.

2016
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:46,940
No,
no.

2017
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:48,880
You know it to be too hard to sanction 
it.

2018
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:52,630
It'll be too hard to ensure that 
everybody had their proper medicals.

2019
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,900
It'd be too hard to find qualified 
fighters because they can't fight.

2020
01:23:55,901 --> 01:23:56,830
But you know,
I mean,

2021
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:01,920
leaving thought Erin Simpson.
Then two weeks later he fought Akiyama 

2022
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,220
very unusual for most people.
There's a few months off in between 

2023
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:08,371
fights in a lot of that is because you 
get beat up and you got to relax and 

2024
01:24:08,371 --> 01:24:08,371
rest and,
and heal up.

2025
01:24:08,371 --> 01:24:08,710
You know,
if you have any injuries,

2026
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:11,500
they have to be fixed.
Some guys break their hands,

2027
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:13,210
you know,
some guys pull ligaments,

2028
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:14,680
they have to get operations.
You know,

2029
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:16,400
Shogun just got an operation on his 
knee.

2030
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:19,030
Can imagine if they did that like in 
Vegas or something.

2031
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:24,040
I think a better bar solution when the 
UFC has this gigantic library of 116 

2032
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:28,570
events,
the best idea is to serve good food,

2033
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,210
have a cool bar,
and have the UFC plans data,

2034
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,990
all these different fucking,
um,

2035
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,490
television steak bar with UFC 
everywhere.

2036
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:41,550
And then when,
during the live shows they have like 

2037
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:41,550
huge movie theater.
Yes.

2038
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:43,060
During or they have it on every goddamn 
10 in the room during a live show.

2039
01:24:43,061 --> 01:24:45,790
They have it on every Goddamn TV in the 
room and you have to pay 20 bucks to get

2040
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:47,380
in or whatever it is.
And call it town.

2041
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,400
They would clean the fuck up one of the 
UFC bar because really it would be.

2042
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:56,410
It's really,
there's a cool thing about watching it 

2043
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:56,410
live.
I love watching fights live because it's

2044
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:58,110
crazy and you're right there when it's 
going down.

2045
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:01,480
It's really nothing.
That experience is nothing like anything

2046
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:04,060
you've ever had before.
If your seats are good,

2047
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:06,610
but if your seats aren't that good,
you know,

2048
01:25:06,611 --> 01:25:08,050
if you're in the bleachers,
you know,

2049
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:13,240
it's kind of cool being there still,
but it's pretty fucking bad ass to go to

2050
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:15,430
a place with a bunch of other people and
watch it on TV.

2051
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:20,850
You know,
like having a ufc bar where people know 

2052
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:21,460
if you can't afford to go to Vegas,
you know you're living in another city.

2053
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:26,700
Everybody,
all your friends are going to go to the 

2054
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:26,700
UFC bar and watch the fight.
Totally.

2055
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:27,550
I think it would be for mma fans alone 
and everything.

2056
01:25:27,551 --> 01:25:30,040
I think Dana could have like its own 
little mini Davis desserts,

2057
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:33,340
peroxide or status.
Think very shallow.

2058
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:36,490
Grave again is a Ravioli.
Do Revenue.

2059
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:44,010
Why do I have Ravioli?
That would work?

2060
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,550
That would work,
but having live fights,

2061
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:48,520
I don't think that would work.
I think there'll be a little too much.

2062
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:49,930
Yeah,
but no,

2063
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:53,830
seriously.
I'm sure that's doing good too.

2064
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:59,210
I don't know.
I don't really think about it pretty 

2065
01:25:59,210 --> 01:25:59,210
crazy.
Some dude,

2066
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:01,090
a facebook me from a UFC champion was 
like,

2067
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:02,630
I'm the manager of.
You have to be driven by fear.

2068
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:03,790
We're in town in a workout

2069
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,500
buddy.
I think that sounds like a great idea.

2070
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:10,760
Fucking twosome squats at UFC gym.
Take a Goddamn Tae Bo class.

2071
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:12,390
Right?
Wonder what kind of classes are going to

2072
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:12,960
have.
They're gonna.

2073
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,740
What kind of liability do you have if 
you let dudes actually beat the shit out

2074
01:26:15,741 --> 01:26:18,170
of each other.
I know because if you have sparring,

2075
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,550
the bottom line is you're not going 
through extensive medicals when you have

2076
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:26,560
sparring.
Like when dudes spar and kickboxing 

2077
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,290
classes.
I've never taken a blood test,

2078
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,220
have never taken a fucking cat scan.
I've never never taken shit,

2079
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,430
but that's like any workout,
any jim has just sign here.

2080
01:26:34,431 --> 01:26:36,000
We're not responsible.
Good Dude.

2081
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:38,300
You don't even sign anything at boxing 
gyms.

2082
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,370
Most of them you don't say shit.
The Ham,

2083
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:45,400
the places I've worked on them,
they'll just slap gloves on you and you 

2084
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,400
climb in the ring with another dude that
you don't even know and you say,

2085
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:47,180
you know,
okay,

2086
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,440
so you know,
just go easy,

2087
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:48,830
go easy.

2088
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,440
Let me see what you can do.
And you're fucking throwing punches with

2089
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:53,240
some dude that you don't even know and 
you know,

2090
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,950
who knows?
Most of the time dudes are cool,

2091
01:26:54,951 --> 01:26:56,840
but every now and then dudes will try to
take your head off.

2092
01:26:56,990 --> 01:27:01,990
They don't know.
He might have an aneurysm just ready to 

2093
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:01,990
pop right behind your eyeball and he 
touches you in a chin.

2094
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:03,230
Your legs go,
you fall,

2095
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:06,320
you hit your head on the back of the mat
and that thing burst and just fills your

2096
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,450
eyeballs with blood and you fucking die 
right there.

2097
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,270
That's possible.
I need to go to.

2098
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,830
When I went to get my eyes checked a 
while back,

2099
01:27:12,831 --> 01:27:17,831
they were like,
there was something in the back of your 

2100
01:27:17,831 --> 01:27:19,631
eye.
It's probably nothing but you should 

2101
01:27:19,631 --> 01:27:19,631
take her to a doctor.
And I'm like,

2102
01:27:19,631 --> 01:27:19,631
ah,
Oh,

2103
01:27:19,631 --> 01:27:19,631
you've got a brain tumor.

2104
01:27:19,631 --> 01:27:24,070
That was like 10 years ago though.
I wouldn't know it right now to smoke a 

2105
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:25,700
lot of weed and working on it.
A lot of vegetables,

2106
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:29,630
15 pounds to get drink my Kombucha to.
You've lost 15 pounds over the course of

2107
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:32,870
how long?
Since the 18th of June.

2108
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:34,610
That's.
That's a lot of wait,

2109
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,490
how the fuck you losing that much weight
crack cigarettes,

2110
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:41,820
hookers.
Now a modified weight watchers,

2111
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:43,480
the weight watchers diet,
which is modified,

2112
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:46,790
meaning you take in less calories.
A weight watchers is.

2113
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:49,970
You have this many points you use them 
based on is the food,

2114
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:52,790
like an orange is two points,
you know as sandwiches,

2115
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:53,780
six points,
whatever.

2116
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:58,990
So what I've been doing is doing the 
weight watchers diet but only eating 

2117
01:27:58,990 --> 01:27:59,930
zero to one point shit.
So mostly vegetables.

2118
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:04,931
Most of you do.
You eat little small meals to keep your 

2119
01:28:04,931 --> 01:28:04,931
metabolism.

2120
01:28:04,931 --> 01:28:08,510
They eat small meals throughout the day.
That's what it's all like one point zero

2121
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:13,070
point shit and I'm not going anywhere 
close to my allotted 35 points a day.

2122
01:28:13,071 --> 01:28:16,000
I'm probably doing seven,
seven points a day.

2123
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,110
You're like a little checks.
Just like chicken.

2124
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:23,150
He loves your God damn check Bro.
You're like Lindsay Lohan starving 

2125
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:23,150
yourself to death.
Totally.

2126
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:23,150
It's great.
No,

2127
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:28,001
but I'm making sure I'm getting all the 
nutrients and proteins and all that 

2128
01:28:28,001 --> 01:28:30,470
stuff.
Since I've done Brian just for Fyi since

2129
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:33,790
I've known why is your phone on?
That's not me or alerts.

2130
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:36,470
You're getting alerts since I've known 
Brian.

2131
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:40,600
He's done this like five times where it 
got heavy and then he got skinny.

2132
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:45,630
You got heavy guy.
Eating is one of the safest ways to 

2133
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:49,430
create your life.
Like he went from.

2134
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,520
You were up at like,
how was the heaviest you wherever at 

2135
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,040
2:43
to 43 and by the way he's.

2136
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,270
How tall are you?
Five,

2137
01:28:56,271 --> 01:28:56,870
eight,
five,

2138
01:28:56,871 --> 01:28:58,700
eight,
2:43.

2139
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:03,910
That's giant.
He was a fat guy like his legs used to 

2140
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:04,290
touch together in the middle,
get a weird,

2141
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:09,291
crazy pants.
His pants were always way too long 

2142
01:29:09,291 --> 01:29:11,280
because his waist and his boss were way 
too big for that long,

2143
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:17,280
so they had.
He had all his pants were like always 

2144
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,690
like shuffling and then this guy got 
dumped by his girlfriend and fiance,

2145
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:19,980
fiance,
sorry.

2146
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,140
It was much more devastating than just a
girlfriend,

2147
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,310
right?
Seven years.

2148
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:27,120
They were together for a long time.
It was very devastating and he went on a

2149
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:30,240
God damn weight watcher,
a elliptical machine,

2150
01:29:30,241 --> 01:29:33,540
rampage.
And over the course of how long?

2151
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,340
Three months,
you lost like 70 pounds.

2152
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,790
I was,
I'm 63 was the lowest I got.

2153
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:43,210
Then I decided to snows in three months.
Yeah,

2154
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:44,820
that's,
that's so unhealthy.

2155
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,190
So unhealthy dude.

2156
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:53,390
You basically starved yourself.
Do you have pictures of yourself when 

2157
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:56,991
you were asking?
Do you have anything that would shock 

2158
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:56,991
the,
uh,

2159
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:56,991
the people at home?
Yeah,

2160
01:29:56,991 --> 01:30:00,351
I do actually have something ready to 
hold that up so I can take a look at 

2161
01:30:00,351 --> 01:30:00,351
that because it was really strange.
He,

2162
01:30:00,351 --> 01:30:05,030
it turns out Brian has a weird head.
We just don't know because it's always 

2163
01:30:05,611 --> 01:30:08,550
like,
it's always embraced in a,

2164
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,660
in a role of soft tissue and you don't 
get to see the true shape of his head.

2165
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:15,390
But when you just see skinny Brian 
Skinny,

2166
01:30:15,391 --> 01:30:20,391
Brian is a strange dude.
I don't even know what nationality he 

2167
01:30:20,391 --> 01:30:20,550
is.
He looks like he's a fucking alien.

2168
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:22,870
I'll find it.
Where's Kenny?

2169
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:27,990
Brian?
We've got to do is we've got to make 

2170
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:30,381
your neck a buildup.
This to match your head is very 

2171
01:30:30,381 --> 01:30:31,020
important.
You know,

2172
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:36,050
you can have a big head as long as you 
have a big neck to support that big 

2173
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:36,050
head.

2174
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:39,920
You got a big heads on and you don't 
have a big neck and that shit look 

2175
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:39,920
strange.
Well,

2176
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:44,130
that's because that's because your head 
is used to the be your body being 

2177
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:47,691
gigantic.
So what you gotta do is you gotTa build 

2178
01:30:47,691 --> 01:30:47,691
your neck up.
You know,

2179
01:30:47,691 --> 01:30:48,240
that's one of the most popular things in
Hollywood though,

2180
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:51,720
for actors to have exercises.
They want you to have a big head.

2181
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,170
What is that about A.
I don't know.

2182
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:57,060
It's a thing where maybe it's a more 
more brains,

2183
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:01,380
but it can't be true because I know some
people would pick heads or stupid as,

2184
01:31:01,381 --> 01:31:06,381
fuck.
Here's a picture of me holding my old 

2185
01:31:06,381 --> 01:31:06,570
pants up.
Wow.

2186
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,490
Well,
this is not helping the people at home.

2187
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:11,880
Now I may find a better one and I'll put
it to my twitter later today.

2188
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:13,800
Well,
when you do,

2189
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:18,000
I'll retweet it because I know people 
are fucking excited to see what you look

2190
01:31:18,001 --> 01:31:18,150
like.

2191
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:23,150
When you look strange.
There's one picture I have that's just 

2192
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:23,430
so scary.
What was interesting is when you became,

2193
01:31:23,431 --> 01:31:25,230
went from being a fat guy to a skinny 
guy,

2194
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:30,260
you also found out that you're 
attractive and you started getting 

2195
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:30,260
girls.
Girls were liking you.

2196
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:31,580
Man was like,
you know,

2197
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:34,080
like shit should be into Brian.
And Brian was like,

2198
01:31:34,081 --> 01:31:35,970
wow,
this is crazy.

2199
01:31:35,971 --> 01:31:38,250
Look at this slide.
Well then what happens?

2200
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,430
Then I settle in and then he'd get a 
girlfriend,

2201
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:43,380
girlfriend.
I gained it all back.

2202
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:45,420
Never gained it all back.
No,

2203
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:49,230
I didn't.
I'm probably one on one 95 right now.

2204
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,630
One 95.
So at least you're still 40.

2205
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,390
Whatever pounds right away from what you
were.

2206
01:31:57,570 --> 01:31:59,410
Right.
I don't want to get back to one 65.

2207
01:31:59,411 --> 01:32:01,210
That was way too.
I looked like I had aids.

2208
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:06,230
No,
you didn't like what you're supposed to 

2209
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:06,230
look like.

2210
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,030
Dude did just so used to sit yourself 
gigantic.

2211
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:09,280
You did not look like you had aids,
I swear.

2212
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:12,130
Never looks like scary skinny.
You never did.

2213
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,850
It looked weird because like all of a 
sudden you were like tiny person.

2214
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:17,740
You know?
That's you.

2215
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:22,810
That's ridiculous.
I thought that looks like a healthy 

2216
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:22,810
person.
Right?

2217
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:23,470
I hate to say that it looks like a 
healthy person.

2218
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:25,360
Your problem is your head's too big for 
your body.

2219
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,710
You got to start working out.
If you started working out to it,

2220
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,190
you'd be a sexy bitch right there.
You're looking sexy as fuck.

2221
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:36,320
Yeah.
There was a dude that I know that has 

2222
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,720
the tiniest head and it always trips me 
out whenever I talked to him.

2223
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:40,060
He has that backwards.
He has a tiniest head.

2224
01:32:40,061 --> 01:32:45,061
Every is a very small head and all I can
think of when I'm next to him was would 

2225
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:45,590
it be like to punch him in his little 
tiny head?

2226
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,880
I don't want to do it.
I would never do it,

2227
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:52,180
but I just think man,
if you punch this guy and not even me,

2228
01:32:52,181 --> 01:32:55,870
like if a person did punch this guy in 
his tiny little head,

2229
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,600
like you could just crush his head.
He's got a bird head.

2230
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:01,030
It's weird.
I'd rather,

2231
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:04,300
I'd rather have a way big to head with 
big two way big too.

2232
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:08,320
Filled with smarts.
My fucking stupid head is smart as fuck.

2233
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:10,630
So,
um,

2234
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,580
your,
um,

2235
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:16,090
that's another skinny photo frame these 
up on twitter.

2236
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:16,900
I'm telling you,
dude,

2237
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:19,180
that looks healthy.
I think I look like,

2238
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:21,020
I think I look like gay lesbian,
right?

2239
01:33:21,021 --> 01:33:22,510
Brian,
that's what you look like.

2240
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:23,650
Goddammit.
You're gay,

2241
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:28,651
lesbian underneath it all.
That's what you look like when you're 

2242
01:33:28,651 --> 01:33:28,651
thin.
That's a layer.

2243
01:33:28,651 --> 01:33:30,400
But I don't want to be a gay lesbian,
but how come you,

2244
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,560
how come you can't stay the same?

2245
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:35,560
What don't you like monitor your weight 
and you see it go up.

2246
01:33:35,561 --> 01:33:37,810
And what do you do?
What's the process when you see it going

2247
01:33:37,811 --> 01:33:42,811
up?
What keeps you from just recognizing 

2248
01:33:42,811 --> 01:33:42,811
that and cutting back on your food?
Well,

2249
01:33:42,811 --> 01:33:43,580
it's not even a cut back on food.
It's,

2250
01:33:43,581 --> 01:33:48,581
it's,
I have the metabolism of a small goat 

2251
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:48,960
where I like goats or skinny as fuck.
Dude,

2252
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:51,490
you're talking about the lean.
That's a terrible example.

2253
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,150
I met it backwards.
You have the metabolism of fat person.

2254
01:33:55,151 --> 01:34:00,151
Yeah,
I mean I fucking eat like two pieces of 

2255
01:34:00,151 --> 01:34:02,761
pizza again.
So if you just gave up and just we're a 

2256
01:34:02,761 --> 01:34:03,340
sedentary fuck and had a normal nine to 
five job.

2257
01:34:03,341 --> 01:34:08,341
We ain't shit at the office and eat shit
for launch and then you came home and 

2258
01:34:08,341 --> 01:34:08,590
you were too tired to work and you ate 
and then watch TV.

2259
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:09,970
You just be a giant fat.
Huge.

2260
01:34:10,130 --> 01:34:15,130
I'd be crazy huge.
I wonder how many grandmother was like 

2261
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:17,200
600 pounds on my dad's side.
Really?

2262
01:34:17,201 --> 01:34:18,670
Yeah.
She was humongous.

2263
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:21,550
Diabetes.
Everything that's scary.

2264
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:22,890
And my dad's side.
Yeah.

2265
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:27,310
I wonder how many dudes who are like 
that have like a hormonal imbalance or a

2266
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:29,620
thyroid imbalance or something that 
could be correct.

2267
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:30,190
Well,
it's.

2268
01:34:30,191 --> 01:34:34,210
So I got mine checked and supposedly 
fine.

2269
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:35,440
Whatever.
That's fine,

2270
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:39,390
but I didn't check your testosterone.
Now I don't know.

2271
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:45,450
I saw this or not.
So I was listening to Sirius satellite 

2272
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:49,771
radio the other day and one of the 
things that we're saying about guys who 

2273
01:34:49,771 --> 01:34:52,321
gained a lot of weight,
there's a lot of times it's just some 

2274
01:34:52,321 --> 01:34:54,961
sort of a,
a hormone imbalance and that it's a 

2275
01:34:54,961 --> 01:34:56,020
maybe a testosterone and balance like a 
cure it with like some cream.

2276
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:58,070
Yeah.
But when I just get more hairier

2277
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:03,370
I don't need that anymore and have some 
fucking energy and,

2278
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:05,240
and not,
not become fat.

2279
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:10,480
Shouldn't get that checked honestly,
because I bet you I'm fucking know you 

2280
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:10,480
tired all the time.
Oh,

2281
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,660
I'm tired from when I wake.
I wake up in the morning,

2282
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:13,450
I'm tired.
Guaranteed.

2283
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:18,490
And especially because you don't do 
anything that forces your body to 

2284
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:18,800
produce it.
You're not involved in any heavy lifting

2285
01:35:18,801 --> 01:35:19,820
or anything,
you know?

2286
01:35:19,821 --> 01:35:24,821
I think that's one of the most important
things when you're maintaining your 

2287
01:35:24,821 --> 01:35:24,821
health,
as you get older,

2288
01:35:24,821 --> 01:35:28,241
you have to do strength training,
you have to do cpr training that makes 

2289
01:35:28,241 --> 01:35:30,500
your body constantly regenerate tissue.
Keep your glands pumping.

2290
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:33,800
When I wake up,
I really feel tired.

2291
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:35,780
Like I,
I never would have woken up and be like,

2292
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:37,250
wow,
I might have sleep apnea too.

2293
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:38,810
I probably had that.
You snore,

2294
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:40,000
chicks tell you snore.

2295
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:45,040
Yeah.
Do you ever like gagging or sleep or 

2296
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:45,040
don't do that?
Well,

2297
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:45,040
you should get tested,
man.

2298
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,550
I got a new mouthpiece that I started 
wearing,

2299
01:35:46,551 --> 01:35:48,680
you know,
because I got diagnosed with sleep apnea

2300
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:51,560
a few years ago.
And one doctor created this mouthpiece,

2301
01:35:51,561 --> 01:35:56,561
it's got Dr Caribbean and Tarzana.
They created some a mouthpiece that 

2302
01:35:56,561 --> 01:36:00,251
keeps your tongue down.
And the problem is I have a big tongue 

2303
01:36:00,251 --> 01:36:02,660
and my neck is big from working out all 
the time and my whole that I have in the

2304
01:36:02,661 --> 01:36:04,010
back of my throat,
it's not so big.

2305
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:09,190
And so when I lie down,
like tongue falls back as I relaxed and 

2306
01:36:09,190 --> 01:36:10,520
covers over the fucking hole and I gag 
and cough.

2307
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:12,740
Like a lot of times it's fat people,
fat people have it,

2308
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:15,050
but athletes have it a lot to anybody 
who has a,

2309
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:20,100
like a big neck.
If you have a big tongue it's probably 

2310
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:20,100
going to happen to you.

2311
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:20,240
So this mouthpiece kind of keeps your 
tongue down.

2312
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:21,620
Well,
he just invented a new one.

2313
01:36:21,621 --> 01:36:23,480
I just started using this new one.
Dude.

2314
01:36:23,481 --> 01:36:25,100
It's incredible.
I wake up,

2315
01:36:25,101 --> 01:36:30,101
I feel so fucking rested.
Mrs Rogan says I don't snore at all 

2316
01:36:30,101 --> 01:36:34,271
anymore and I feel so much better than 
my dreams are super vivid man.

2317
01:36:34,281 --> 01:36:37,550
My dreams are really intense.
They're really like very,

2318
01:36:37,551 --> 01:36:41,240
very lifelike to the point where 
sometimes my alarm goes off in mid dream

2319
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:42,530
and I'm like,
wow,

2320
01:36:42,531 --> 01:36:46,370
that was a dream because it's not even,
they're not even like crazy dreams.

2321
01:36:46,371 --> 01:36:47,870
Their dreams,
like life dreams.

2322
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,010
It's like,
you know,

2323
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:54,340
it's very strange.
They don't have a dream like feel to 

2324
01:36:54,340 --> 01:36:54,340
them.
They feel like I,

2325
01:36:54,340 --> 01:36:56,950
I dropped another level below in my,
my,

2326
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,820
my depth of my sleeping,
you know?

2327
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:00,990
And so I'm having these,
um,

2328
01:37:00,991 --> 01:37:05,991
uh,
maybe I'm reaching a rem level that I 

2329
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:05,991
wasn't reaching before because I was 
snoring all the time.

2330
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:10,390
He would choke and I have a sleep apnea 
problem because even the mouthpiece 

2331
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:10,390
didn't totally cure it.
It's,

2332
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:11,250
it definitely made it better.
Right.

2333
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,060
But I still snowboard this new one.
I don't snore at all.

2334
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:18,220
Is that a picture of you and Jenna 
Jameson for when she waits,

2335
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:22,880
but when we were in Arizona.
So,

2336
01:37:22,881 --> 01:37:24,260
uh,
what's the goal now?

2337
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:25,970
You're at one 95.
And what's your goal?

2338
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:31,010
Trying to get to win 65.
You should get your hormones checked 

2339
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:31,010
out.
Son might have problems,

2340
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:36,620
you know,
they can once you can do things to cure 

2341
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:36,620
it,
but one of the things that that works is

2342
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:38,300
squats,
squats,

2343
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:42,260
and heavy lifting makes your body 
produce more testosterone,

2344
01:37:42,261 --> 01:37:45,410
makes your body produce more growth 
hormone is very good for you,

2345
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,290
but you've got to not be pushy.
You don't actually do them.

2346
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:53,710
Yeah.
You don't seem like the type of dude 

2347
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:53,710
that's really into it just seemed like 
the,

2348
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:53,870
the,
the,

2349
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:58,690
the energy I per day is so small that to
me,

2350
01:37:58,850 --> 01:38:01,050
you looked at it like I feel like I am.

2351
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:05,190
I'm barely trying nurses and I'm barely 
trying not to go back to sleep.

2352
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:08,040
Jam to you.
I need to get yourself checked out.

2353
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:09,750
Yeah.
What if you have a real issue?

2354
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,880
But if I've had it,
it's been.

2355
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:15,080
I've had it my whole life.
If I've had it,

2356
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:20,900
what do you think?
I don't know what fucking damn kids get 

2357
01:38:22,321 --> 01:38:26,200
off my lawn.
We haven't looked at the photo,

2358
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:26,640
the,
uh,

2359
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:29,100
the questions on,
on twitter and forever.

2360
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:34,160
Oh,
here's the other thing that I did last 

2361
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:34,160
week that I forgot.
Uh,

2362
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:34,560
I actually gave my phone number out on 
twitter,

2363
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:38,160
what's going on with that fucked up 
royally.

2364
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:43,161
I gave my phone number out,
I gave it to Doug Benson because doug 

2365
01:38:43,161 --> 01:38:47,511
was going to come to vegas this weekend 
and he wanted to come hang out with us 

2366
01:38:47,511 --> 01:38:47,610
at the House of Blues and I said,
yeah man.

2367
01:38:47,611 --> 01:38:49,560
I said I can even get into the UFC.

2368
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:51,510
Here's my,
here's my phone number,

2369
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:56,630
call me.
And I put it in the main twitter box 

2370
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:59,730
instead of the direct message box.
I thought I was saying to direct 

2371
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,470
message.
So I tweeted my fucking number two,

2372
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:02,490
the whole world.
So I was like,

2373
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:07,520
God damn it.
And then it just started vibrating and 

2374
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,330
five breeding and the calls were just 
coming in like they did never stopped.

2375
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:11,680
It was like one after the other,
you know when you have.

2376
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,510
I've got 130 something thousand twitter 
friends and who knows how many,

2377
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,920
10,
maybe 10,000.

2378
01:39:16,921 --> 01:39:21,921
Might've seen it.
I tried to delete it but it was too 

2379
01:39:21,921 --> 01:39:21,921
late.
It was out there.

2380
01:39:21,921 --> 01:39:23,400
And so then as I was driving to the 
verizon store to go change my number,

2381
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,680
I just start answering phone calls.
Like,

2382
01:39:25,681 --> 01:39:27,230
what's up,
man?

2383
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:28,890
Yeah man,
what's going on?

2384
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,530
My Way?
The verizon store,

2385
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:32,850
I'm turning in my phone.

2386
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:38,180
I have to,
I would answer it here for you guys and 

2387
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:38,180
show you.
But uh,

2388
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,450
I mean I have a rise in the verizon 
doesn't work here where I live,

2389
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:40,780
you know,
uh,

2390
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,520
but I did it all.
We eat it as a family act.

2391
01:39:43,521 --> 01:39:48,521
Very nice that you could have told all 
those more onto called you and ruined 

2392
01:39:48,521 --> 01:39:53,301
your phone number.
You could have just posted all those 

2393
01:39:53,301 --> 01:39:53,301
online and fuck them,
you know.

2394
01:39:53,301 --> 01:39:54,930
But you were nice about it.
You take the high road.

2395
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:55,570
She,
well,

2396
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:56,820
what are they doing?
They're just,

2397
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:58,410
look,
I fucked up.

2398
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:59,580
It's out there,
right?

2399
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:04,840
You're not going to take it away.
It's not like everyone's going to be so 

2400
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:04,840
cool that no one's going to call you on 
that.

2401
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:09,671
That'd be great to have.
Everyone was cool because some of the 

2402
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:09,671
people just wanted to call to say hi,
why not?

2403
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:12,570
If you were 18 years old and you were a 
fan of some dude and all the sudden he's

2404
01:40:12,571 --> 01:40:15,720
got his phone number online and you call
him and he actually answers like,

2405
01:40:15,721 --> 01:40:18,120
Holy Shit,
but that's most of the calls.

2406
01:40:18,121 --> 01:40:19,950
Most of the calls were people saying,
Holy Shit,

2407
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:22,620
and they were all cool.
What did you go about fate or losing?

2408
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,960
They're just never going to bring them 
in now.

2409
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:30,200
And all these conversations about 
fucking out of conversations about 

2410
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,650
comedy.
I conversations about about mma.

2411
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:34,410
I had a bunch of different conversations
but all kinds of shit and I was like,

2412
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,730
I'm going to keep this phone,
fuck it.

2413
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,800
So I kept it as a fan line.
You want to call it?

2414
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,750
I really do answer it.
Not all the time,

2415
01:40:39,751 --> 01:40:41,700
but I pick it up every now and then.
Eight,

2416
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:42,030
one,
eight,

2417
01:40:42,031 --> 01:40:42,540
five,
one,

2418
01:40:42,541 --> 01:40:43,080
seven,
two,

2419
01:40:43,081 --> 01:40:43,650
seven,
seven,

2420
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:43,980
four.

2421
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,440
That's my phone number.
That's my fam line.

2422
01:40:46,441 --> 01:40:51,441
Now I said that was a real number.
I thought that'd be kind of cooler to,

2423
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:58,860
to actually give out the real number 
instead of getting another number and 

2424
01:40:58,860 --> 01:40:59,770
making it my fan line.
It's like actually kind of cool that you

2425
01:40:59,771 --> 01:41:01,570
actually have my real number.
I mean that's like my,

2426
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:04,330
my legit number that I've had for a 
decade.

2427
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:08,110
Right.
So that's my number eight and that's the

2428
01:41:08,111 --> 01:41:13,111
deal.
This weekend I'm going to be at the 

2429
01:41:13,111 --> 01:41:17,910
Ontario Improv with the one and only 
Joey Coco Diaz and that's going to be a 

2430
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:19,480
lot of fun.
Ontario is a bad ass club.

2431
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:21,190
It's selling out quickly.
So,

2432
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:22,900
um,
if you want to get in,

2433
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:25,150
I know a lot of people got shut out in 
Irvine.

2434
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:30,180
I talked to a lot of people that were 
disappointed and I'm sorry I didn't get 

2435
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:30,180
in,
but you know,

2436
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,990
these clubs they only see like 300 
people.

2437
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:34,090
So if you,
if you want to come to a show,

2438
01:41:34,091 --> 01:41:39,091
especially like the Friday's shows and 
the Saturday shows Sunday sometimes a 

2439
01:41:39,091 --> 01:41:41,890
little easier because you've got less 
people out doing things.

2440
01:41:41,891 --> 01:41:44,020
But Friday and Saturday those was 
fucking tickets sell quick.

2441
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:49,500
Irvine was awesome.
Irvine last week and every show sold 

2442
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:49,500
out.
Every show was cool.

2443
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,230
People were cool as fuck.
It was awesome.

2444
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:55,740
And then house of Blues was awesome too.
Although I did get a tad too drunk just 

2445
01:41:55,811 --> 01:41:58,270
to touch what happened.
Unshocked over the line.

2446
01:41:58,271 --> 01:42:00,490
What happened bad because I didn't see 
nothing.

2447
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:05,520
It was nothing bad.
The show was great but I definitely got 

2448
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,580
too drunk and I,
I told the second half of a joke twice,

2449
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
but as,
because I didn't tell the first half of 

2450
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,531
it right the first time.
So I tried to like Redo it and then I 

2451
01:42:13,531 --> 01:42:13,531
and then I realized as I was saying that
I was like,

2452
01:42:13,531 --> 01:42:16,220
I already said this isn't that,
does that to here,

2453
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,090
do you guys.

2454
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:19,630
But I just admit it,
you admit it and like I immediately just

2455
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:22,820
stopped and admitted it and just said 
what happened and Eddie Eddie's going to

2456
01:42:22,821 --> 01:42:23,680
pointed out and I go,
yeah,

2457
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:28,681
I know,
but I did it because I fucked up this 

2458
01:42:28,681 --> 01:42:28,681
part of it.
Right.

2459
01:42:28,681 --> 01:42:29,230
It's not a good enough answer.
It's the answer.

2460
01:42:29,231 --> 01:42:30,580
It really is.
I was drunk.

2461
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:31,680
That's the answer.
I mean,

2462
01:42:31,681 --> 01:42:36,681
I'm saying what I did wrong,
but the only reason why I did it again 

2463
01:42:36,681 --> 01:42:36,681
because I was drunk,
I just,

2464
01:42:36,681 --> 01:42:39,100
I didn't have anything to eat and I had 
like three shots in a row on stage,

2465
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:44,490
which is two shots too many,
but still it was still fun.

2466
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:47,620
Fucking fuck fun.
Like really happy crowd.

2467
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:49,480
They were cool.
Sam Tripoli was hilarious.

2468
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,940
Sam was awesome.
He crushed it.

2469
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:54,990
It was really good at that place.
Could go either way.

2470
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:57,820
Sometimes UFC nights that places,
you know,

2471
01:42:57,860 --> 01:42:58,450
house of Blues.

2472
01:42:58,450 --> 01:43:00,500
It's just a madhouse.
He kissed it,

2473
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:05,550
we fixed it,
we fixed it when we got rid of the 

2474
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:06,250
standing.
Only that changed the vibe of it so much

2475
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:11,430
because people are uncomfortable before 
and you felt that uncomfort from them 

2476
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:15,120
because the fact that they had a stand 
and watch a show and I made a lot more 

2477
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:15,760
money than on those shows,
but I don't care.

2478
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:20,820
I don't want people to stand up.
I think it sucks when we saw stand up 

2479
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,540
when we saw stan hope rather than shit 
cured me.

2480
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:26,020
No more standup shows.
I'll never make someone pay to see me.

2481
01:43:26,021 --> 01:43:29,080
Stand up ever again and we fucked up and
Memphis,

2482
01:43:29,081 --> 01:43:34,081
joey and I did a show in Memphis and it 
had to be stand up because it was a 

2483
01:43:34,081 --> 01:43:37,981
really tiny place and it was a standard,
would only see like 100 people and all 

2484
01:43:37,981 --> 01:43:39,400
of these people were standing by the 
bar,

2485
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:44,500
so half the crowd was standing and they 
were all talking at full voice,

2486
01:43:44,501 --> 01:43:47,650
like bar voice,
like no one was like paying attention to

2487
01:43:47,651 --> 01:43:48,310
the show.

2488
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:53,490
When Joey went onstage,
no one was like maybe 10 percent of the 

2489
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:57,311
people in the bar weren't talking.
It was just a low rumble and then you 

2490
01:43:57,311 --> 01:43:57,311
know,
it was like,

2491
01:43:57,311 --> 01:43:59,060
okay,
this is the final Straw.

2492
01:43:59,061 --> 01:44:02,750
Never have a standing room show ever.
It's not fun to watch fan.

2493
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:08,290
You know,
the part of what is good about a shell 

2494
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:10,811
as you can kick back and relax,
where we'll be awesome is if they every 

2495
01:44:10,811 --> 01:44:11,780
fucking place you went had real 
comfortable seats.

2496
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:14,120
You know,
if you could sit on a couch like this,

2497
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,550
if that's how you watched a every comedy
show,

2498
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,770
you know,
kicking back and chilling on a couch,

2499
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:22,460
how fucking it would be way funnier 
because you'd be feeling relaxed.

2500
01:44:22,461 --> 01:44:24,270
She have no tension.
It's like you're,

2501
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:27,350
you're more likely to laugh at shit when
you're standing.

2502
01:44:27,351 --> 01:44:29,480
Your fucking feet hurt.
That sucks.

2503
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:33,800
First Person I ever heard say that was 
Jimmy Norton and are Jimmy talking about

2504
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:33,890
it?

2505
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:37,020
There was um,
promoting one of his shows and uh,

2506
01:44:37,090 --> 01:44:38,320
it was talking about,
you know,

2507
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,330
people were calling in and saying that 
they heard there was standing tickets in

2508
01:44:41,331 --> 01:44:42,290
the back.
And Jimmy was like,

2509
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:42,740
no,
no,

2510
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:43,360
no,
it's going to be,

2511
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,920
this was my show is a standing show.
And I was like,

2512
01:44:45,921 --> 01:44:47,630
wow.
He's like real adamant about that,

2513
01:44:47,631 --> 01:44:49,010
but I didn't think it was that big of a 
deal.

2514
01:44:49,011 --> 01:44:49,460
I'm like,
well,

2515
01:44:49,461 --> 01:44:50,860
maybe he's just,
you know,

2516
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:56,050
he's more rigid with his style or 
something and he wants to make it like 

2517
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:56,050
that.
But then I,

2518
01:44:56,050 --> 01:45:00,330
you know,
I realized that that's the right thing 

2519
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:00,330
to do.
Those standing shows,

2520
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:00,470
they'll stand hope shows.
I mean,

2521
01:45:00,471 --> 01:45:02,300
they're fun and everything,
but it's not as fun.

2522
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:05,170
Yeah.
To me,

2523
01:45:05,171 --> 01:45:10,171
I don't know if it's my age or what it 
the whole time I'm just focusing on the 

2524
01:45:10,171 --> 01:45:13,291
pain of my standing.
Like how uncomfortable it wasn't a huge 

2525
01:45:13,291 --> 01:45:13,291
thing,
man.

2526
01:45:13,291 --> 01:45:15,100
I didn't like standing up with a 
concrete floor when I was 10.

2527
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,510
No,
it doesn't feel good.

2528
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:21,870
When I worked at gateway,
had to do it eight hours and weren't 

2529
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:21,870
allowed to sit down.
You know,

2530
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:24,070
the day that you would find like the 
thickest shoes and then you put like the

2531
01:45:24,071 --> 01:45:27,270
best like inserts.
It's not good for you.

2532
01:45:27,271 --> 01:45:28,240
It's not,
you know,

2533
01:45:28,241 --> 01:45:28,990
your body's supposed to

2534
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:31,170
be moving around too because that's what
I do.

2535
01:45:31,171 --> 01:45:33,690
Stand up and I'm on stage for an hour 
and a half or whatever.

2536
01:45:33,691 --> 01:45:34,610
I'm on four.
It doesn't.

2537
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:36,750
I've never hurt.
I feel fine.

2538
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:38,670
I'll get off on feel.
I feel energized,

2539
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:42,030
but standing in one place and not moving
at all for an hour and a half.

2540
01:45:42,031 --> 01:45:44,520
That sucks.
That's terrible.

2541
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:45,330
You know,
you're,

2542
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:47,050
you're carrying your weight.
You know,

2543
01:45:47,051 --> 01:45:49,710
you don't even think about it,
but you're not even like moving.

2544
01:45:49,711 --> 01:45:53,130
You don't even get blood flowing through
it and you're right next to other people

2545
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:58,250
so you can't like stretch your arms out 
and move your body and touch your toes 

2546
01:45:58,250 --> 01:45:59,820
and shit and unwind.
Like if you don't do that,

2547
01:45:59,821 --> 01:46:01,080
man,
your body feels like shit.

2548
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:06,900
Think it's very important for.
That's one of the reasons why I don't 

2549
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:06,900
like doing comedy too much in bars 
anymore.

2550
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:09,510
I don't like I'll do it every now and 
then just for a goof.

2551
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:12,810
Just to experience something different.
You'd get a different taste of comedy,

2552
01:46:12,811 --> 01:46:13,680
you know,
do like a little,

2553
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:18,000
a shitty little Hollywood gigs every now
and again.

2554
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,760
But I think it's very important that the
right atmosphere,

2555
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:22,230
it has to be set.
You know,

2556
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,030
the same atmosphere that is good for 
music.

2557
01:46:24,031 --> 01:46:25,890
It's not the same atmosphere of is good 
for comedy.

2558
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:27,660
You know,
your music.

2559
01:46:27,661 --> 01:46:29,550
You could go up and people could be 
talking to like,

2560
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:31,830
how's everybody doing out there?
And then you play your song,

2561
01:46:31,831 --> 01:46:32,370
man,
you don't.

2562
01:46:32,371 --> 01:46:35,320
You don't require their attention 100 
percent there.

2563
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:37,530
They're complete interaction.
You don't require that.

2564
01:46:37,531 --> 01:46:41,250
You don't require a response,
a definite response from them.

2565
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:44,730
Comedy though,
it's tricky,

2566
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:46,500
very tricky.
Setting up the atmosphere.

2567
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:51,510
So tricky.
That's why it's important to go on the 

2568
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:52,920
road would dudes who I think are funny.
I always go on the road with friends.

2569
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:57,980
It's so important.
The worst thing you could ever do is go 

2570
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,910
on the road and a guy opens for you and 
the guy fucking sucks.

2571
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:01,950
He doesn't just suck.
He likes sucks.

2572
01:47:01,951 --> 01:47:06,951
Like aggressively and like it's like bad
material and it's badly done and totally

2573
01:47:08,431 --> 01:47:11,340
different crowd that you would have,
you know,

2574
01:47:11,370 --> 01:47:13,710
that he would have normally to.
Yeah,

2575
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,390
most of them would never have a crowd at
all.

2576
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:17,100
The really bad ones.
Yeah.

2577
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:19,140
And I've been one of those really bad 
ones by the way.

2578
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:24,141
I'm not shitting on them.
I mean it's part of the development 

2579
01:47:24,141 --> 01:47:27,051
process in writing this book that I'm 
writing about a lot of my early comedy 

2580
01:47:27,051 --> 01:47:31,251
days,
so making me rehash old bombing stories 

2581
01:47:31,251 --> 01:47:35,930
that I forgot of like terrible fucking 
disastrous tales of the road and they're

2582
01:47:36,061 --> 01:47:37,530
fucking crazy,
you know,

2583
01:47:37,531 --> 01:47:39,360
but a lot of it was just because I 
sucked.

2584
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:42,660
I was just terrible.
I didn't know how to relax back then.

2585
01:47:42,661 --> 01:47:45,780
I didn't know how to do comedy yet.
I was really just feeling it out,

2586
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:48,150
which is fine and good,
you know,

2587
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:51,510
and it's a thing you have to go through,
but I don't want people going through it

2588
01:47:51,511 --> 01:47:54,570
before I get up onstage because if they 
do it right before you,

2589
01:47:54,571 --> 01:47:56,130
it's like,
it taints the whole room.

2590
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:59,640
So if someone just came on stage and 
just shit into their minds,

2591
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:04,670
you know,
and then you're forced to like clean 

2592
01:48:04,670 --> 01:48:06,840
everything up and start from scratch.
You have to do damage control,

2593
01:48:06,841 --> 01:48:07,230
you know?

2594
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:09,520
Yeah.
So weird.

2595
01:48:09,521 --> 01:48:11,410
It a comic.
I know he's,

2596
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:16,060
I think 20 years old and uh,
he's just the nicest guy,

2597
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:17,140
little kid ever,
you know,

2598
01:48:17,141 --> 01:48:19,330
he's always,
he's always asking for advice too,

2599
01:48:19,331 --> 01:48:24,331
like Ari and me and stuff like that.
It's just a really nice guy and he just 

2600
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:25,780
can't tell him how,
just how nice this guy is.

2601
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:27,900
Did you fuck him?
Well,

2602
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,030
he just said that.
He told me the other day that he's going

2603
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:32,920
to be like,
lead role in like a real movie now,

2604
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:36,550
and he's going to go from this nice 
little open mic young kid.

2605
01:48:36,551 --> 01:48:38,490
Now he's going to be like,
lead role in a movie and it's just,

2606
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:41,170
it's a big movie as well.
I think it's a,

2607
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:42,550
it's.
I think it's a big movie.

2608
01:48:42,551 --> 01:48:44,140
It's like,
it's about what it is.

2609
01:48:44,141 --> 01:48:47,180
It's supposed to be like a cloverfield,
but it's um,

2610
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:51,370
it's a like at a party with like 
generation x guys or whatever.

2611
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:54,520
Generally it becomes a monster movie.
How it's recorded.

2612
01:48:54,521 --> 01:48:56,580
Like it's like,
what about cell phones,

2613
01:48:56,590 --> 01:48:58,830
cell phones and stuff like that.
Man,

2614
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:00,950
I'm not buying them anymore.
I

2615
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:04,130
bought that shit with like the um,
I thought it was kind of interesting.

2616
01:49:04,131 --> 01:49:05,630
The Blair witch project,
how they did that.

2617
01:49:05,631 --> 01:49:07,030
I thought that was a good movie.
I mean,

2618
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:10,400
it was really for what it was when we 
saw the Blair witch project,

2619
01:49:10,401 --> 01:49:13,420
the first time I saw him was we were in 
Houston and Chris go,

2620
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:15,380
Chris Mcguire and I were working at,
uh,

2621
01:49:15,381 --> 01:49:19,670
the laptop and the,
this was way back in the day whenever it

2622
01:49:19,671 --> 01:49:24,671
came out.
And this dude who worked at the movie 

2623
01:49:24,671 --> 01:49:27,731
theater across the street came to the 
show and after the show we're all 

2624
01:49:27,731 --> 01:49:29,390
hanging out and smoking weed.
And the dude goes,

2625
01:49:29,391 --> 01:49:34,391
Hey,
do you guys want to go watch the Blair 

2626
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:34,391
witch project right now?
We can all watch it.

2627
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:34,391
Like,
we'll set it up.

2628
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:35,330
I got the keys,
we'll turn it on.

2629
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:37,100
I'm like,
get the fuck Outta here.

2630
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:37,880
You serious?
He's like,

2631
01:49:37,881 --> 01:49:38,690
yeah.
So we,

2632
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,250
it was like a midnight show.
Okay.

2633
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:45,460
So we went over there 2:00
in the morning and this dude had the 

2634
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:46,460
keys unlock the place.
We got popcorn and shit.

2635
01:49:46,610 --> 01:49:48,690
And it was him,
the dude he,

2636
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:53,720
he worked there.
A couple other people that work with 

2637
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:56,221
him,
like a guy and a girl and me and Chris 

2638
01:49:56,221 --> 01:49:58,590
Mcguire says five of us.
We watched the Blair witch project and 

2639
01:49:58,590 --> 01:49:58,590
it was bad ass was the perfect way to 
was.

2640
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:00,130
It freaked me the second time I watched 
it,

2641
01:50:00,131 --> 01:50:03,130
it was terrible network.
Not only did it not work,

2642
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:08,370
there was some dude who brought his baby
and this fucking Mexican dude and his 

2643
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:10,770
baby was making all this noise who's 
like to,

2644
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,650
you know,
and you know,

2645
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:15,520
so a bunch of people like shushed,
um,

2646
01:50:15,521 --> 01:50:18,040
and he got aggressive with the people,
fuck you bitch,

2647
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:20,320
don't fucking touch me bitch.
And I was like,

2648
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,220
oh,
okay,

2649
01:50:21,221 --> 01:50:26,221
now I have to fucking think about this 
guy and his fucking inconsiderate ways 

2650
01:50:26,221 --> 01:50:27,670
and he's got a baby and people trying to
shush them and he's,

2651
01:50:27,671 --> 01:50:32,671
you know,
fucking yelling at them obscenity and 

2652
01:50:32,671 --> 01:50:32,860
threatening them,
I'll fucking kick your ass bitch.

2653
01:50:32,861 --> 01:50:37,861
And that kind of shit.
And so now you got to think about him 

2654
01:50:37,861 --> 01:50:37,861
for the fucking movie or.
So it was a bad experience

2655
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:43,240
as you know,
I don't really like going to movies 

2656
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:43,240
anymore.
So roll the dice.

2657
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:43,240
Yeah,
I mean I,

2658
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:45,440
especially when nowadays it's like I can
get a blue ray,

2659
01:50:45,441 --> 01:50:50,441
I can,
I can wait six months and that the 

2660
01:50:50,441 --> 01:50:50,850
experience at my house now is better 
than I think going movie.

2661
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:53,670
Yeah.
If you have a nice good sized TV and you

2662
01:50:53,671 --> 01:50:54,300
know,
you're,

2663
01:50:54,301 --> 01:50:56,180
you've got a good size sound system,
plastic,

2664
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:59,880
you don't have to worry.
I can smoke weed.

2665
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:01,470
Yeah,
you can have whatever food you want.

2666
01:51:01,471 --> 01:51:03,280
You can have a comfortable couch to 
watch it on.

2667
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:08,300
It's a way better experience,
but people like the event of being out 

2668
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:08,300
there with other people,
you know,

2669
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:13,010
people like.
That's one of the things that people 

2670
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:14,631
like about a concert Fuckin Ozzy Osborne
was playing just to you and it was just 

2671
01:51:14,631 --> 01:51:16,110
you and ozzy alone with his band in the 
room.

2672
01:51:16,410 --> 01:51:17,790
You probably wouldn't even want to be 
there.

2673
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:23,090
You know,
it'd be like maybe listen to a song or 

2674
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:23,090
two and be like,
this is crazy.

2675
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:23,130
He's looking me in the eyes and singing 
fucking,

2676
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:24,870
you know,
you'd have to look at you.

2677
01:51:24,871 --> 01:51:28,960
You're the only one there,
but if you're one of 15,000

2678
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:30,360
in an arena then it's cool.

2679
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:34,740
Then it's fun.
That's crazy.

2680
01:51:34,741 --> 01:51:36,900
But I think movie theaters need to 
reboot,

2681
01:51:36,901 --> 01:51:37,380
man.
I,

2682
01:51:37,381 --> 01:51:39,540
I think they need to stop going,
hey,

2683
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:43,140
we're charging you $14 for tickets.
$8 for a popcorn.

2684
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:46,020
$5 for a pop.
I think they need to kind of fuck that.

2685
01:51:46,021 --> 01:51:47,850
You have to pay that much just to watch 
it.

2686
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,940
Whereas if you want to own it,
it's like 30 bucks and a few months.

2687
01:51:50,941 --> 01:51:54,000
Not even that.
You can get at best buy for 1499 on DVD,

2688
01:51:54,001 --> 01:51:54,600
you know,
12,

2689
01:51:54,601 --> 01:51:55,800
99.
Not Blue Ray though,

2690
01:51:55,801 --> 01:51:56,580
right?
Blu Ray.

2691
01:51:56,670 --> 01:52:01,670
30 bucks.
Sometimes opening week or first week 

2692
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:01,670
they'll have it on sale for like a 17.

2693
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:03,520
Yeah.
If you watch something blue,

2694
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:04,620
right.
It's so much better.

2695
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:06,990
So much more comfortable watching shit 
at home.

2696
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:12,370
This.
I watched the wolf man the other day 

2697
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:12,370
again.
Yeah,

2698
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:13,800
I watched it again.
I don't even like it.

2699
01:52:13,801 --> 01:52:16,070
It's terrible movie,
but I think it's dope when it's.

2700
01:52:16,190 --> 01:52:17,760
When it's at home,
what's at home?

2701
01:52:17,761 --> 01:52:18,680
I like it.
It's not bad.

2702
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:19,800
My son in the movie theater,
I'm like,

2703
01:52:19,801 --> 01:52:22,140
I paid for this fucking stupid movie.
This movie's retarded.

2704
01:52:22,770 --> 01:52:23,790
What do I say?
That was pretty good.

2705
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:26,610
Oh,
the crazies crazy dude.

2706
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,000
The craziest as good goddamn horror 
movie.

2707
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:29,880
Really?
Yeah.

2708
01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:32,490
I don't want to tell you the premise 
because I didn't know a thing about it.

2709
01:52:32,491 --> 01:52:33,750
I'll give you the blue rag.
I got it up here.

2710
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:34,190
Oh,
cool.

2711
01:52:34,830 --> 01:52:37,440
I didn't know a thing about it.
I knew nothing,

2712
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,230
but someone had said this is a really 
scary movie.

2713
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:41,210
Someone twitted it.
So.

2714
01:52:41,211 --> 01:52:43,170
Ah Mate,
check it out because I don't know.

2715
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:45,350
I love what I don't know anything about 
movie.

2716
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,900
I didn't know nothing.
I didn't.

2717
01:52:46,901 --> 01:52:51,901
I hadn't seen a single preview.
I saw a photo with a guy with a 

2718
01:52:51,901 --> 01:52:51,901
pitchfork.
That's it.

2719
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,000
That's all I know.
So I'm like,

2720
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:54,140
okay.
Some crazy shit.

2721
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,300
Obviously guys killing people with a 
pitchfork,

2722
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,850
right.
Great movie.

2723
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:02,090
I mean not the best movie in the world,
but a good goddamn horror movie.

2724
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:03,890
Good solid.
Like Holy Shit.

2725
01:53:03,891 --> 01:53:05,060
Horror movie.
And then I'm like,

2726
01:53:05,061 --> 01:53:06,830
why wasn't this movie popular?
Well,

2727
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,630
why didn't this movie go somewhere in 
the movie theater?

2728
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:11,990
It's pretty fucking good.
I didn't hear a thing about it.

2729
01:53:11,991 --> 01:53:13,280
Did you hear anything about it?
Uh,

2730
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:16,160
I just remember they advertise or the 
advertising,

2731
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:19,850
how they advertised it.
The last airbender I have not seen it.

2732
01:53:19,851 --> 01:53:21,890
You know why?
Because you're not fooling me again.

2733
01:53:21,890 --> 01:53:25,640
You fuck em night Shama Lama.
Ding Dong your movies.

2734
01:53:25,650 --> 01:53:27,790
I terrible.
I think it was done.

2735
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,800
I think half the fucker happy Internet 
internet sat there when he had zero 

2736
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:33,860
percent on rotten tomatoes.
I was like,

2737
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,250
yes.
This is hilarious.

2738
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:38,090
I know he has zero percent on rotten 
tomatoes for a long time.

2739
01:53:38,230 --> 01:53:39,980
Like six or seven or something.
Yeah,

2740
01:53:39,981 --> 01:53:44,981
he's got a few percent now.
There's a few fools out there or some 

2741
01:53:44,981 --> 01:53:46,160
staff members from unite.
Shama Lama.

2742
01:53:46,161 --> 01:53:51,161
Ding dongs fucking what?
What makes me even more angry is the 

2743
01:53:51,161 --> 01:53:53,540
fact that the opposite is happening with
toy story three,

2744
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:57,120
because that's the movie.
I don't care if you're the most angriest

2745
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:59,420
person who road.
You sit there and you will go at least.

2746
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:00,740
Yeah.
That was a good movie.

2747
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:05,770
You know?
That was those pixar movies are always 

2748
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:05,770
good,
man.

2749
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:05,770
They were so good at it.
One bad one,

2750
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:07,490
I think there was one or two bad ones 
and it's just like,

2751
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:09,470
really I want to meet these people and 
go,

2752
01:54:09,471 --> 01:54:11,000
what the fuck is wrong with you?

2753
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:16,030
Like are you really that angry of a 
person or are you somebody from a 

2754
01:54:16,030 --> 01:54:17,750
different movie studio just being a 
Dick,

2755
01:54:17,751 --> 01:54:22,751
you know,
because there's a lot of espionage and 

2756
01:54:22,751 --> 01:54:25,931
fucking double crossing online for sure.
A lot of positive comments as well by 

2757
01:54:25,931 --> 01:54:27,320
paid shills,
you know,

2758
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:30,590
people have accused the UFC of doing 
that all the time on the underground.

2759
01:54:30,591 --> 01:54:35,591
People were saying,
how many of you guys are paid UFC 

2760
01:54:35,591 --> 01:54:35,591
Scheel's as far as I know there are 
none,

2761
01:54:35,591 --> 01:54:37,160
but there might be.
I might just not know about them.

2762
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:41,040
It might very well be that they hire 
people to get online.

2763
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:43,340
I mean it's effective marketing.
If you think about it,

2764
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,170
you get online,
you hype up a fight,

2765
01:54:45,171 --> 01:54:47,570
you start talking,
you instigate comments,

2766
01:54:47,571 --> 01:54:49,220
you know.
Do you think that,

2767
01:54:49,221 --> 01:54:54,221
you know,
Shane would have been knocked out by 

2768
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:56,531
Brett Rogers in or that there would have
been knocked out by Brett Rogers?

2769
01:54:57,170 --> 01:54:59,330
Sometimes it is.
I know it is.

2770
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:04,360
I know,
but I know in the pride days they used 

2771
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:04,360
to do that.
There's just a lot of people also.

2772
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:06,060
That's all they think that is true,
but,

2773
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:11,270
but as far as like a,
as far as like putting together threads 

2774
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:15,821
and pushing real positive threads and 
talking about how excited you are for 

2775
01:55:15,821 --> 01:55:16,400
something,
it's a good move.

2776
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:18,170
You know,
it was a smart move,

2777
01:55:18,171 --> 01:55:19,790
you know,
if you get a good thread together,

2778
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:22,400
I think Amazon reviews or that.
Yeah.

2779
01:55:22,401 --> 01:55:26,230
Well I pay attention to Amazon's refuse.
That half of it could be total bullshit.

2780
01:55:26,231 --> 01:55:27,980
Yeah.
I even try to read it to say,

2781
01:55:27,981 --> 01:55:32,981
okay,
does this sound like something like a 

2782
01:55:32,981 --> 01:55:33,050
publicist made or the company made?
No one can stop you from doing that.

2783
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:34,520
You could review the shit out of your 
own stuff.

2784
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:35,480
Yeah.
You know,

2785
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:38,030
I've never done that with anything I've 
ever done.

2786
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:40,530
I've never done that.
But um,

2787
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:46,090
I was pleasantly surprised at how cool 
fucking comments I got on the itunes 

2788
01:55:46,090 --> 01:55:50,511
thing.
I thought when I was going over the 

2789
01:55:50,511 --> 01:55:50,511
podcast,
I'm like,

2790
01:55:50,511 --> 01:55:53,211
this is going to be a bunch of Douche 
bags that don't want to hear us yapping 

2791
01:55:53,211 --> 01:55:53,310
about things because this is kind of a 
free form podcasts.

2792
01:55:53,311 --> 01:55:55,860
A lot of times we talk about the same 
subjects we've talked about before,

2793
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:58,080
but they're relevant to the current 
conversation.

2794
01:55:58,081 --> 01:56:03,081
I can't.
I got to assume that each one of these 

2795
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:04,851
to our things is its own thing and try 
not to repeat things as much as 

2796
01:56:04,851 --> 01:56:04,851
possible,
but.

2797
01:56:04,851 --> 01:56:07,530
And it's also just hard to remember what
was 28 times two.

2798
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:12,510
How many hours is that of training?
I also think that we get into subjects a

2799
01:56:12,511 --> 01:56:15,360
lot deeper than you can if you just do 
it an hour podcast,

2800
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:17,550
you know,
I'd like to our podcast format,

2801
01:56:17,551 --> 01:56:22,551
but I think there's something about like
really intense conversations or you 

2802
01:56:22,551 --> 01:56:22,551
know,
we have these cool conversations.

2803
01:56:22,570 --> 01:56:24,660
You have to let them kind of take their 
fucking path,

2804
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,290
you know?
And sometimes it's like,

2805
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:28,260
well this is it.
We're just going to stop it now.

2806
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,530
But you know,
just more shit to be talked about,

2807
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:34,860
you know,
but so many fucking people who said,

2808
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:36,420
you know,
things on the itunes,

2809
01:56:36,421 --> 01:56:37,080
we're,
we're cool.

2810
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:39,090
There's a bunch of complaints about the 
sound,

2811
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,790
which we did have problems with the 
sound but we fixed all that shit.

2812
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:46,030
And if you think it's too low,
stop listening in on your iphone speaker

2813
01:56:46,031 --> 01:56:47,460
phone.
It's low for everything.

2814
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:51,360
Brian's very upset with this.
Listen guys said into how low it was.

2815
01:56:51,361 --> 01:56:55,320
And so today I recorded myself going on 
like Adam Carolla as you know,

2816
01:56:55,321 --> 01:56:58,400
all the couple of them and then.
And then ours got allowed us.

2817
01:56:58,410 --> 01:57:03,410
This is good now we mean and I think 
this is the right way to do it too 

2818
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:06,681
because I've heard things where people 
talk on lab mix and it's not quite as 

2819
01:57:06,681 --> 01:57:06,681
loud or clear.

2820
01:57:06,681 --> 01:57:11,150
Yeah.
I think the reason why radio stations 

2821
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:11,370
use these kind of mix and standup comedy
uses this kind of mix and this is,

2822
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:16,450
this is the right shit to use.
So this is the way we're going to keep 

2823
01:57:16,450 --> 01:57:19,431
it.
As far as like putting up this green 

2824
01:57:19,431 --> 01:57:19,431
screen,
I kind of gave up on that shit.

2825
01:57:19,431 --> 01:57:20,870
I think it's distracting.
I might put up a,

2826
01:57:20,871 --> 01:57:22,290
um,
a banner or something,

2827
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:26,490
maybe put up a big flat screen and have 
a constantly changing logo.

2828
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:32,030
Make you could put together some Nettie 
video and will be playing in the 

2829
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:32,030
background.
Do you think could move,

2830
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:34,140
just show ideas on a toilet.
But I think I've given up on the idea of

2831
01:57:34,141 --> 01:57:39,141
us being in space looking liquor,
cable access show 'em.

2832
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:45,170
The fleshlight is our only sponsor.
And the lawyer said before that if it 

2833
01:57:45,170 --> 01:57:46,890
wasn't a sponsor,
I would still tell you to use it.

2834
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:50,400
Things the fucking bomb diggity me too.
It's awesome.

2835
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:53,850
Um,
gigs this weekend.

2836
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:58,940
I will be at the Ontario Improv Friday,
Saturday and Sunday with Joey Diaz.

2837
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,770
Uh,
as you said,

2838
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:03,250
tickets are selling quick,
so if you want to come,

2839
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:09,110
come the next time I'll be.
If you're in La and you want to go 

2840
01:58:09,110 --> 01:58:11,130
somewhere closer.
I am a at the universal city.

2841
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:16,160
John Lovitz has a comedy club up there 
that John Lovitz comedy club and that's 

2842
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:18,740
next Saturday.
It's like the 17th or some shit,

2843
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:20,790
something like that to show next 
Saturday,

2844
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:22,380
two shows.
I've never been there before.

2845
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:24,870
I heard it's good and Jon Lovitz is a 
nice guy.

2846
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,570
Like that guy.
I love that shopping center.

2847
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:28,200
I had her,
that whole universal place.

2848
01:58:28,201 --> 01:58:29,580
I love that place.
Yeah,

2849
01:58:29,581 --> 01:58:31,470
that's a cool place I think being at 
Disney road.

2850
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:32,520
So,
uh,

2851
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:34,350
that's it.
Ladies and gentlemen for this week.

2852
01:58:34,351 --> 01:58:36,120
Thank you very much for tuning in.
We appreciate it.

2853
01:58:36,121 --> 01:58:39,540

2854
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:43,480
Much love and we will see you all next 
week.

2855
01:58:43,481 --> 01:58:44,860
Same Bat time,
same bat.

2856
01:58:44,861 --> 01:58:46,210
Not.
This is not even the same time.

2857
01:58:46,211 --> 01:58:48,400
It was next week.
We're going to keep doing it though.

2858
01:58:48,401 --> 01:58:49,780
We will not stop.
We will not end.

2859
01:58:49,781 --> 01:58:54,781
And we do this all because of your 
support because the fact that you guys 

2860
01:58:54,781 --> 01:58:54,781

2861
01:58:54,781 --> 01:58:55,870
Thank you very much.
I love you bitches.
