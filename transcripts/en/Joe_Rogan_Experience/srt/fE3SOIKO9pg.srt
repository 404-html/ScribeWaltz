1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,160
Just legit,
I don't sit on wallet so I don't play 

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,160
with wallets.
Fuck no,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,680
sorry.
You're ready.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,110
Oh,
that wasn't sure.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,760
You got up to move cameras around.
Phil.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,290
Show me is you have a mini fanny pack.
It's very small.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,070
It's like you can carry everything I 
need and a small phone.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,650
He can't carry a modern phone.
That's like pre modern.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,490
The six fits in there is six plus would 
be a problem.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,720
Maybe Bang against your deck.
Tighten up.

11
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:34,721
So what's going on man?
So for everybody who hasn't seen you on 

12
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:35,880
the podcast before,
let's give them a brief synopsis.

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,920
You were a trainer one time at Marine 
Land and you,

14
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:43,200
uh,
you're known as the walrus whisper.

15
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:45,810
That's your,
your handle on twitter,

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,970
which I didn't select by the way.
He didn't know.

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,240
How'd you get it?
I was on a TV show called white boat and

18
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:53,220
it was grassroots as hell in Canada.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,800
So basically what they do is they fly to
Argentina,

20
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:56,160
they,
they,

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,610
they sort of rent the course.
So.

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,230
And then they,
instead of it being,

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,330
you know,
wipe out whatever country.

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,420
This time it's Canada.
So it was really grassroots and so they 

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:08,970
told us if you guys can like help 
advertise,

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,920
so get onto your twitters,
get on your this,

27
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,170
get on your that.
They called me walrus whisper.

28
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,100
It just made sense to put it.
Otherwise I don't particularly love it.

29
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:18,630
So it was like for a show,
it was great,

30
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,780
but let's explain.
You worked for marine land,

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,670
you got fired.
You were,

32
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:26,340
you were taking care of this wall.
Risks and it,

33
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:31,341
it became like a big cars because a lot 
of people were concerned about the 

34
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,960
animal's safety there and since then 
they've been cited like what?

35
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,490
What has happened with Greenland?
Okay,

36
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,230
well,
so I'll give you a quick rundown.

37
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,820
So I worked at marine land.
I was killer whale trainer.

38
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,970
I was the guy jumping off the killer 
whales doing the flips off dolphins,

39
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,260
everything else.
Um,

40
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,520
I wasn't fired.
I quit amidst some duress,

41
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,480
a difficult period where,
and I'll elaborate the basically a water

42
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,930
disinfection unit broke down and the 
resolve wasn't so much to fix it.

43
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,080
It was to pump it with more and more 
chlorine basically.

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,380
Uh,
the way water is disinfected of 

45
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:06,380
Greenland,
they used an ozone generator,

46
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,520
so they use ozone in conjunction with 
the Koreans or mitigate the chlorine use

47
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,090
they elected instead or rather the soul 
controlling mind elected to put off 

48
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,550
actually fixing it and let's just at 
night they're pumping it with chlorine.

49
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,360
Well you can just imagine the effect,
and I'm not going to talk about a little

50
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:22,170
bit of chlorine.
So this was,

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,920
this was a tough time.

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,850
So.
So I actually quit.

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,500
I actually quit.
I imagine the effect.

54
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:27,030
So it hurt the animals.
Oh,

55
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,230
we talked about this on the earlier 
shows that people want to go back in 

56
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,630
time a few years to when you first 
appeared on the show,

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,890
there was like some serious issues,
health issues with dolphins,

58
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,560
right?
Their skin's peeling off there.

59
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,620
They've got ulcers.
I mean the sea lions are losing for in 

60
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,220
patches bleeding out.
I mean this case cases,

61
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:49,230
at least one animal died and things 
started getting real bad.

62
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,700
And of course my walrus in,
in all of this is there and she's in the

63
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,890
water as well.
So if this only compounds the issue,

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,590
and the thing about the Walrus is it's 
an,

65
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:00,490
I use the word a lot.
It's anomalous.

66
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,190
My relationship with,
she thinks I'm her mom.

67
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,430
It was like a scientific thing that 
happened or brain circuitry opens.

68
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,470
I imprint on her.
So my smell,

69
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,380
everything I looked like or you know,
because when she was a baby,

70
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,660
well she was actually two years old when
it happened.

71
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,370
That's what makes it kind of us on a 
baby.

72
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,420
That's not a baby.
No.

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,360
How old is that in the wall?
Where swirled like is it dog ears?

74
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,780
No,
she's still young.

75
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:23,050
I mean dog years.
She's babyish.

76
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:23,640
Yeah.
Two years.

77
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:25,780
This is not,
but she's fairly young.

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,770
And you were a caretaker so she 
imprinted that you were her parents?

79
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,840
Well,
there was sort of a traumatic thing that

80
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,340
happened.
We,

81
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:37,341
uh,
we were drawing blood from them because 

82
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:37,341
back then,
you know,

83
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:37,341
they're not trained to,
to,

84
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:40,750
to accept the pain of drawing blood.
And so,

85
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,280
uh,
she wasn't conditioned for this.

86
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,510
They were young.
We had to get blood.

87
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,620
So we were actually doing a job on 
another wall.

88
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:50,621
Risks and she was sort of loose running 
out and we were wrestling her down and 

89
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:53,500
smooshy come over and she's climbing 
hectic and crazy and uh,

90
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,790
you know,
she's still almost 300 pounds at that 

91
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:58,790
point.
You know,

92
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,230
you gotta move her if she's,
if she's climbing all over you,

93
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,550
it's a big obstruction.
So I sort of put my hands in front of 

94
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,550
her face and that's when it happened.
I'm telling you,

95
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,510
you see it was like a magical moment.
All of a sudden something happened and 

96
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,480
she just looked at me.
Her eyes changed.

97
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,020
I changed.
I was now a different person.

98
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:13,420
I'm not her mom.
She was following me.

99
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,000
So I walked down away from the scene 
just following me.

100
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,980
And from that moment on she never 
stopped.

101
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,950
And that's just sort of became the basis
of our relationship is that I've sort of

102
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:25,951
raised her.
So do you put like the touch on her to 

103
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:25,951
touch on it yet with these two hands 
right here,

104
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:27,220
right in front of her face.
And what it.

105
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:29,890
Is that a normal thing with animals?
Like I said it,

106
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,010
it almost never happens.
You hear if the animal's imprinting on 

107
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,110
humans a lot of times,
not usually at her age.

108
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,370
That was a bit advanced for that to 
happen.

109
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,960
Usually it happens when they're very 
young.

110
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,040
Right.
If it's going to happen.

111
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:39,680
Yeah,
it does.

112
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,760
It does happen when people raise bears 
and a lot of weird animals that you 

113
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,321
wouldn't ordinarily think is pets,
but I don't know if it would be an 

114
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:49,321
actual imprint.
Like the imprint is different.

115
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,760
There's one thing of familiarizing.
How do you differentiate?

116
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:52,780
Well,
it's just.

117
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,630
It's natural.
Oh,

118
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,290
she's protective of me.
She will not leave my side.

119
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,840
I mean I could walk to the edge of the 
earth with her and she'll be beside me.

120
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,210
You can't do that with her.
She's still a marine land right now.

121
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,650
I,
I,

122
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:07,651
yes.
I haven't seen any updated photos and 

123
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:07,651
some,
so I can't be absolutely sure,

124
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:08,680
but yeah,
I'm fairly sure,

125
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,080
but she's hitting.
They won't do not bring her on display.

126
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,270
Not on display.
You're not gonna.

127
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,480
Find her why they hide.
They hide.

128
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:19,500
The pinnipeds basically seals sea lions 
in the walruses.

129
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,670
They bring them.
In her case,

130
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,370
she doesn't perform anymore.
When she comes out,

131
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,970
she's not reliable,
you can't get to do anything.

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,120
All she does is goes out on stage and 
she looks for me frantically so it's not

133
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:33,121
reliable.
So they bring her up between shows 

134
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:33,121
occasionally so she can see the sun and 
that's it.

135
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:33,460
And so,
you know,

136
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:38,461
I've got to have people in there with 
video cameras ready and I mean it's 

137
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:38,650
tough,
but we get the videos,

138
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,660
we get the information I need.
So what's going on with you and them 

139
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,830
now?
Because there's been a series of 

140
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,830
lawsuits and this is one of the reasons 
why you wanted to come in here and talk.

141
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,260
Right?
So they've,

142
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,460
uh,
so they sued me,

143
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:55,630
of course,
a frivolously they sued me with plotting

144
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:56,830
to steal a walrus.
Is the,

145
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,780
is the allegation.
This was in 2000.

146
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,850
This is actually a five year 
anniversary.

147
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,760
Comes up on a unbalanced plotting to 
steal a walrus.

148
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:09,761
Did you try to get her out of there?
Know if I tried to get her out of there 

149
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:09,950
and have her today?
No,

150
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,900
I wouldn't.
I have nowhere to put a walrus.

151
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,850
Well that's not true.
I do have a river in the front yard,

152
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:18,851
but I have no interest in,
in releasing her into the Nag River and 

153
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:18,851
then watch her go over the falls.

154
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:19,460
It's,
I have no interest in that.

155
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,290
So no,
nothing like that.

156
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,640
I don't have a beach front Arctic home 
to carrier too.

157
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,660
But yeah.
So they started suing the shit out of 

158
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,601
anyone who spoke,
anyone who spoke on the record was 

159
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:31,601
getting sued.
So it wasn't just me,

160
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,680
it was a number of people and uh,
yeah.

161
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,690
So we just elected to try to fight as 
long as we could try to sustain this 

162
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,551
legal battle because you know,
in lawsuits you've got to reveal a lot 

163
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:42,551
of information,
a lawsuit.

164
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:45,230
It's not fun like this Greenland's had 
everything from my phone to like the,

165
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,010
I mean,
not physically,

166
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,570
but I've given what you mean by 
everything.

167
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:50,660
Like your phone communications.
I have everything.

168
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,290
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

169
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,370
So if they sue you for trying to take a 
Walrus,

170
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,400
he didn't actually try to take.
They can get access to your phone 

171
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,400
records.

172
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,400
They can ruin your life.
Yeah.

173
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,251
But that doesn't mean anything they can 
get access to your phone or why would 

174
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:05,251
they have access to your phone records 
they have?

175
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,120
They have.
I have a legal obligation of giving them

176
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,520
anything that is relevant to their 
claim.

177
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,690
So be it communications,
be it photographs,

178
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,700
but what does that mean?
Does that mean they can read all your 

179
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:18,700
text messages,
read all your emails,

180
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,350
read them all?
Yeah,

181
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,160
they know everything.
Yeah.

182
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,720
Wow.
It's crazy.

183
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:28,721
And I have zero from them after five 
years because they're using the system 

184
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:32,621
as a means to just simply abused me and 
acting the fool as there as Greenland's 

185
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:34,550
legal team does exceptionally well 
proved,

186
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,640
proved very effective in,
you know,

187
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,770
abusing a guy like me.
Whereas a corporation with endless 

188
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:41,770
amounts of money just sue the shit out 
of me.

189
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,240
So they're basically just suing you to 
punish you and to try to keep other 

190
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,860
people from doing the same thing and 
talking about them.

191
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,370
They've sued media.
They've sued a student.

192
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,280
Eighteen year old kid from California 
who didn't eat.

193
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,790
It was a yet to be released.
A project movie.

194
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,180
He made almost like a cartoon.
He was in the,

195
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,290
uh,
in the key of marine lands,

196
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,630
Canada's last remaining Orca Kiska and a
marine land caught wind of that and they

197
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,740
sued them for a million bucks.
Of course.

198
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:17,741
I assume that settled now.
I don't know that there's no way of 

199
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:17,741
knowing because I haven't heard anything
of it.

200
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:21,100
But what was their lawsuit based on?
They,

201
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,140
at least in what I think I just scanned 
the documents,

202
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:27,700
but they alleged that I can't remember 
the.

203
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,390
How does that work when they sue someone
from California and does he have to go 

204
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:33,390
to Canada?
That's interesting.

205
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:33,690
I don't know.
Actually I,

206
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,540
and that's,
that's what was so confusing about it.

207
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,330
I was like,
now you're,

208
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,350
you're suing Americans and stuff like,
I don't know if that works.

209
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,840
They sued another writer in fact as well
in an American writer.

210
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,660
I'm a,
they don't give a shit.

211
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,650
Let's see.
You didn't,

212
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,050
they get,
they get fined recently.

213
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,510
So didn't something happened along those
lines?

214
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:55,511
Yeah.
They got charged with 11 counts of 

215
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:56,980
animal cruelty a little over a year ago.
Um,

216
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,690
I was in court,
of course marine land,

217
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:05,691
Sue's OSTP PCA for 21 million,
alleges agency wanted to destroy the 

218
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:06,780
theme park.
So that's where we're going.

219
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:10,170
So basically down the road,
over the course of,

220
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,430
okay,
I got to get into this.

221
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,950
So the charges,
they have 11 charges of animal cruelty.

222
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:17,070
First they were five at our five or six 
and then an additional five or six.

223
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Now there's a total of 11 charges for 
animal cruelty that marina has to go to 

224
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,890
the criminal court to defend against.
They drag it on.

225
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,330
As always,
I'm in court every freaking day.

226
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,250
You can bet your ass.
I'm even,

227
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,830
even one time there was a,
uh,

228
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,370
it was a confidential meeting.
In fact it was not for me and a local 

229
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,400
writer knock on the door,
cut,

230
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,140
sort of walk in and the lawyers are 
looking at us like,

231
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,430
the fuck you doing here,
but we're like,

232
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:39,940
hey,
like can we sit in on.

233
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,810
But anyways,
so I don't know what you just said.

234
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,250
It was,
it was during the negotiations between 

235
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,250
the,
the,

236
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,490
the crown and the Spca for the town.
Yeah,

237
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,560
the crown.
That's the one who would be laying the 

238
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:54,560
charges,
the,

239
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:54,560
uh,
the animal cruelty charges.

240
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:54,560
So you get charged.
Okay.

241
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,000
What is the crown?
The crown is the,

242
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,380
is the justice.
He's like the,

243
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,450
essentially the judge.
You're before the judge.

244
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,060
Oh,
sorry.

245
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:04,920
We don't know what the fuck that shit is
to get confused.

246
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,870
He doesn't wear one,
but.

247
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,160
Okay.
So,

248
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,170
so it's like crown land.
I know crown land.

249
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,440
That's public land.
Yeah.

250
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:16,441
So,
so I imagine that's probably is in some 

251
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:16,441
capacity.
Why it's called crown.

252
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,040
I don't know.
I'm not,

253
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,810
I'm not a legal expert,
but nonetheless.

254
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:23,811
So they're in their negotiating and 
basically the way animal cruelty 

255
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:24,010
charges,
uh,

256
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,060
are our pursuit is they have to meet to 
thresholds.

257
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,090
Number one,
you have to have a reasonable chance of 

258
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,750
conviction.
Number two,

259
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,780
it has to be in the public's interest to
pursue a series of the first charges 

260
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,681
were immediately dropped because,
and this is just driving me crazy for 

261
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:44,790
years that this has been going on and it
continues.

262
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,560
But if I,
for instance,

263
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:49,530
if I make a complaint to the LSPC and I 
provide a photo of an animal,

264
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,650
which of course I did that is clearly 
damaged and fucked up,

265
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,750
if they don't physically have evidence 
of who it is that's actually harming the

266
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,100
animal,
there's no cruelty.

267
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,010
They can't do anything.
So in that case,

268
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,190
they dropped the charges against marine 
land because the evidence didn't 

269
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,490
actually point to anyone specifically.
It was just evidence of damage animals.

270
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
So they throw a bunch out,
okay.

271
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,140
But then there was a bunch that were 
that they did have a good chance at at a

272
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,160
conviction,
and this is where marine land promised 

273
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,410
the crown that this was going to be a 
very expensive process,

274
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,790
long and drawn out process,
and the crown agreed that it didn't meet

275
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:28,791
the threshold.
It exceed the threshold of being in the 

276
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,191
public public interest in spending a lot
of of of public dollars pursuing these 

277
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:33,630
charges.
And so they drop the rest of them.

278
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,760
Marine land turns around and Sues Dos pc
for $21,

279
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,770
million claiming that it was malicious 
prosecution that of course they name,

280
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,030
they didn't name me specifically,
but I'm always the unnamed Marineland 

281
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,730
employee in that and they alleged that I
threatened to defund them and all the,

282
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,920
they think I'm this keyser soze a lead 
character,

283
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:51,270
which I don't mind playing up a little 
bit,

284
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:56,271
but they think I'm pulling strings all 
over the place and then I have exists 

285
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:56,271
half don't.

286
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:56,740
I think there's employees there that 
think that I'm like,

287
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,290
I don't know.
So they,

288
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,410
they get brought up on 11 charges of 
animal cruelty.

289
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,110
The charges get dropped and they turn 
around and sue the government.

290
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Twenty $1,000,000.
The same government that led them off 

291
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,991
for years.
The SPCA has been complacent and 

292
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:15,490
complicit in,
in certainly allowing greenland to 

293
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:15,750
operate as they have unimpeded for,
you know,

294
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,840
50,
50 years.

295
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:21,841
They've had a good relation.
Greenland in fact donated the land of 

296
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:21,841
which the,
uh,

297
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,440
Niagara Falls humane society is,
is built on,

298
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,160
which is where the.
Oh,

299
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,240
SPCA operates out of.
There was a plaque on the wall until,

300
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,040
you know,
after 2012 and we started,

301
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,850
spoke out that honored murraylands owner
John Holder for his generosity.

302
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,340
Yeah.
You sort of get red pill,

303
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,150
is that red pills at the right pill 
pretty quickly when you wake up?

304
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,540
Pill.

305
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,580
So that was my wait,
what moment?

306
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:47,581
Holy Fuck.
Thinks things started to change pretty 

307
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,641
fast for me once I realized the depth of
which marine land was sort of in with 

308
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:52,390
all levels of government,
really all levels of government.

309
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:53,350
And so they,
you know,

310
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,080
they continued to sort of allow for them
to do these things,

311
00:12:56,081 --> 00:13:01,081
but,
but they're suing the government can't 

312
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,560
possibly be in bed with the government 
and suing them or the Canadian 

313
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,120
Association of Zoos and aquarium,
which used to accredit all the zoos and 

314
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Canada or still does.
They accredit them.

315
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,150
So they try to,
they try to say,

316
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:10,990
oh,
this is a good zoo.

317
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,030
It's accredited.
A Marine land,

318
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,590
I believe also threatened them because 
they were not going to renew their,

319
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:18,850
uh,
their uh,

320
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,480
their agreement this year.
And so marine land claimed to have left 

321
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,790
them and they said,
you know,

322
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,800
we're,
we're in the phase of development right 

323
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:29,800
now.

324
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,160
We're gonna.
Just leave this Canadian Association of 

325
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Zoos and aquariums.
It's absolute bullshit.

326
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,840
They were not.
They were.

327
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,200
So yeah,
marine lines basically has there.

328
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:37,030
They're out of friends,
that's for sure.

329
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:40,060
Finally.
But it took a lot of shit to get finally

330
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:40,930
get that,
to get to that.

331
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,830
But the real issue in your mind is the 
way they treat the animals,

332
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,110
the way they run their business,
right?

333
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,140
Is that.
I would say that I've expanded now into 

334
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,511
just arguing that those animals should 
not be in a relaxed position,

335
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:58,270
be altogether the whales pools is done,
it should be done,

336
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,560
done.
It should be done.

337
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:03,390
And I think after blackfish mean before 
you came on or when you came on,

338
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,350
it was before black fish had been 
released.

339
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,560
And then once people saw what actually 
happens to these super intelligent 

340
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:12,670
animals,
when you lock them up in swimming pools,

341
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,290
they,
they're starting to realize it and see 

342
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:18,290
worlds.

343
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:18,520
Attendance is down and people are down 
on the whole idea.

344
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,430
Especially killer whales.
I mean,

345
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,730
God,
they're just giant,

346
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:26,731
majestic animals.
It seems so fucked up to put them in 

347
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:27,970
these tanks and to separate them from 
families.

348
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:29,900
I mean the emotional distress they go 
through it.

349
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,010
I'm a firm believer that emotionally we 
don't even have the slightest sense of 

350
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,821
how complex they can be because they 
don't have an ability to express 

351
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:42,061
themselves to us and other than eating 
us occasionally and then weed killer 

352
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:42,310
whales only do in captivity.
Yeah.

353
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:47,311
There's no.
There's no records of a killer whale 

354
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:49,251
attacks in the wild state.
Fuck people up in captivity though 

355
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:49,251
enough.
Oh,

356
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:50,850
I've been in the pool with a pissed off 
killer whale.

357
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,800
Have you?
Oh yeah.

358
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,000
I jumped in one time.
I was.

359
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,710
I'm a stubborn,
a bit of a cowboy.

360
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:56,420
He's a young guy too,
and like adrenaline junkie.

361
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,200
I like to have fun.
I like to jump off the kilo,

362
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,230
Elekta her to throw me up high.
So I was having a show with her 

363
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,491
basically the way that shows where she 
throw you their tail on the end of a 

364
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:06,491
roster mentally.
I never know dunks you.

365
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:10,990
It's called the rocket ride.
You get on the front of the whale as 

366
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,950
such at the top of the water and then 
she starts to pump her tail and you dive

367
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,090
down with her.
She'll follow you everywhere,

368
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,530
everywhere you go.
And then,

369
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:16,940
uh,
it's like flying a plane,

370
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:17,570
man,
it's amazing.

371
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:22,571
And then you just arch up and then she 
just takes it to the moon and she's 

372
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:25,061
screaming under water when she's having 
a good time or rather when she's 

373
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:25,800
expressing herself that she's gonna toss
you this particular time when,

374
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:26,340
uh,
when I was,

375
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,530
when I probably shouldn't have gone in 
the water by while she was pissed,

376
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,000
I could see in their eyes,
how could you tell that she's no,

377
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,890
the animals lick it.

378
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,890
I mean,
that's the whole basis of being a 

379
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:38,890
trainers to get to know the animals,
know their behavior,

380
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,800
know everything about them.
You spend a lot of time with them.

381
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,440
What are the indications?
So in this case I was.

382
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,570
So the way the shows were,
I mean they don't,

383
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,630
they don't exist anymore,
but back in the day was you work the 

384
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:49,670
animal initially just to get a sense of,
of their demeanor.

385
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,300
So you've got to jump in,
you got to run around,

386
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,120
you get a gauge,
you know,

387
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,470
you got a good sense of how they are on 
that particular day.

388
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,850
She just wasn't responding real quick.
Her eyes were a little big,

389
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,330
big.
She wasn't focused on Asia.

390
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,750
Looking elsewhere,
she's sort of drifting off a bit.

391
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,780
I just didn't really have her attention,
but I think I don't know what maybe I 

392
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:07,780
had my dad in the crowd or something.

393
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,620
I want it to jump off.
So I look at the senior trainer at the 

394
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:11,620
time,
she's like,

395
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:11,620
I don't know dude,
like you're gonna jump in and like,

396
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:11,960
fuck it.
I'm jumping in.

397
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,740
I go to jump in,
I get to the edge of the pool.

398
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,330
She standard directly above or below me.
I dive over her.

399
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,300
She,
she lunges at me and she snaps and I see

400
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,370
it from below me.
Like I see under that.

401
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:29,600
She's drawn up and snapped at me.
So now I've snapped at you like tried to

402
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:30,740
bite.
She tried to grab me.

403
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,530
So now I feel like if she really wanted 
a bite you,

404
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:34,640
she would just be like,
oh yeah,

405
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:35,330
well,
so,

406
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,940
so now I'm supposed to have warning bite
or was it a bite bite?

407
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,840
Prob.
Definitely a warning.

408
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:43,090
But otherwise I wouldn't be here 
tonight.

409
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,630
She if you.
That's what I'm saying.

410
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:46,180
Like it's not as she would miss.
No,

411
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,870
she's not going to miss so and so and 
so.

412
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:52,871
It gets further.
So now I'm in the water and I'm now at 

413
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:52,871
the top of the water and,
and staring down at her.

414
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,540
She's now inverted upside down and she's
swimming and she's circling the pool.

415
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,630
So upside down.
Yeah.

416
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,910
Huh?
What'd you get frustrated?

417
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:03,911
They start doing these things.
She's upside down and she's swimming in 

418
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:03,911
circles and I'm looking at going,
Holy Shit,

419
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:04,730
if I,
if I take off out of the pool,

420
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,640
that's going to trigger some response 
out of her that I don't necessarily want

421
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:10,070
to know.
So I'm saying why would that happen?

422
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,770
I think that it,
if she doesn't want you out of the pool,

423
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:13,370
you're not getting out.

424
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,690
You're,
if you're getting out of the pool,

425
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,610
it's gonna be.
It's gonna be a hard decision if I,

426
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,190
if I start trying to erase out,
she knows I'm trying to get out.

427
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,380
She doesn't want me to actually stay in 
me.

428
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,280
Actually just keep me in it.
I don't want to know where that's going.

429
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:27,340
That's interesting.
So you knew that you had to stay in 

430
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,280
there then?
I'm without choice.

431
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,200
That's,
that's the best course of action at this

432
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,000
point because I'm not going to win a 
race out of that pool.

433
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,480
And so now I'm upright.
She comes to the surface and I see her 

434
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,080
dorsal fin and she's coming pretty 
quickly at me and I put my hands up like

435
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:40,490
this.
I'll never forget it.

436
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,540
She works her tail down.
Arcserve backup like stops dead at me.

437
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,160
It's,
I remember this big wake happen.

438
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:50,160
I put my hands on her rostrum I just 
sorta tap kind of and then I put my feet

439
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:50,700
on her pecs.

440
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,860
I sorta,
she takes me to the stage,

441
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,890
she dunks down,
she and then she picks me up,

442
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,600
puts me on the stage.
I sort of back away like,

443
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:58,590
wow,
thank you.

444
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,740
Thank you for like being nice to me.
I had a friend's dad one time there and 

445
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,500
uh,
he's one of these guys.

446
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,670
I told them I took them on a tour.
I'm like,

447
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,770
okay,
just don't touch the big male sea lions.

448
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:08,610
I mean,
they got big teeth.

449
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:11,130
They wanna rip your arm off the Kent.
They're not typically aggressive,

450
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,750
but just don't touch him.
And he's in there like this.

451
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:13,320
I'm like,
Oh dude,

452
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
I take them out to show the killer 
whale.

453
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,740
I could see that this was another time 
of course,

454
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,930
but I could see that she's losing 
patients.

455
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,420
And she did the same thing.
As soon as we turned our backs,

456
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:21,900
I said to him,
I go,

457
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,170
you know what?

458
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,870
Maybe we should just step away.
As soon as he turned his back to go,

459
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,300
she lunged same thing and tried to,
tried to grab.

460
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,820
It's crazy man.
And that was just like,

461
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,850
holy shit man.
So they don't have killer whale shows 

462
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:34,850
there anymore.
Well,

463
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,150
that killed that particular killer 
whale.

464
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:37,590
Kisco.
She's the only one left in Canada.

465
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:42,591
There's no more in Canada.
There's not ever going to be in 

466
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:42,591
redlands.
Never going to get another one.

467
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:46,040
Uh,
she's been sort of unresponsive for a 

468
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,040
long time.
She's on a lot of medication,

469
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,670
medication,
tons of medication.

470
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,720
What kind of medication do you put a 
killer whale on while she's got 

471
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,791
different?
Gauge the blood and you start putting 

472
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,830
them on an antibiotic antibiotic,
you'd get them on a uh,

473
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,750
uh,
uh,

474
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,340
how do you take blood from a killer?
We'll flip over and they got out,

475
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,610
they've got a in their tail,
there's a series of large veins.

476
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,160
You just roll them over and they let you
know everything's.

477
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,310
Everything is.
Everything is trained in that day.

478
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:12,360
You're going to provide it voluntarily.
So,

479
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,680
and it takes a long time to train these 
things,

480
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,150
but you train them to and you just pick 
it.

481
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:16,340
You just literally grab this little 
needle.

482
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,930
You put it in the,
in the vein,

483
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,340
and they don't get pissed at you.
They get pissed.

484
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:23,190
If you miss and you keep trying,
don't do that.

485
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,190
Fuck yeah,
I've seen it.

486
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,270
It happens.
But they let you take their blood if 

487
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,270
they're healthy and responsive.
You,

488
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,270
of course,
if they're not,

489
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,340
there's nothing that's going to get you 
to the,

490
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,550
get them to the edge of the pool,
but so you,

491
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:37,560
you take their blood and then they,
what do they find?

492
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,110
Send it to the lab.
You want to look at cortisol levels,

493
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,900
how the stress is you want to look at 
white blood count,

494
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:43,170
see if they're finding any infections.

495
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,010
Uh,
you know,

496
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,900
there's always a,
you know,

497
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:50,901
in her case there's always something,
a lot of the animals are in fact on 

498
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:50,901
value and a lot of different sites.
Yeah.

499
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,020
Tons.
What's that?

500
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:53,650
That is like rampant use in,
uh,

501
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,210
in,
in,

502
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,010
in the aquariums.
Why?

503
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,670
Yeah.
Volume.

504
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Yeah.
I'm relaying accused me of stealing 

505
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:02,700
value and in fact in the lawsuit as 
well,

506
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:02,700
which is absolutely not true.
Is this,

507
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,840
is this used everywhere or is it 
greenland?

508
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,530
Greenland.
Sea World's everywhere.

509
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,580
Yeah.
Yes,

510
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,290
absolutely.
Like dolphins,

511
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,920
dolphins around them all the time.
Sure.

512
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,050
When I was,
when I was,

513
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,780
when I left marine land,
I had the agreement again.

514
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,650
I left fairly amicably considering the 
situation,

515
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,090
but you know,
I want it to play my cards right.

516
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,100
And murraylands owner called me back in 
specifically to help a dolphin.

517
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,270
And it was the theater.
Of course,

518
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:30,240
the waste that was in the daily mail.
What's.

519
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,040
What's the other one?
The Dodo.

520
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,030
The Dodo.
A good one.

521
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,200
Buzzfeed.
Let's go with buzzfeed.

522
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Seaworld puts its whales unveiling 
volume like drug documents say Jesus.

523
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:44,541
Fuck.
Those documents are from a lawsuit 

524
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,250
between marine land and sea world where 
seaworld sued Marineland.

525
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,250
See on terrorism at seaworld sued

526
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:48,570
marine.
Yeah.

527
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,560
The old Benzodiazepines,
I'm telling you.

528
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,590
Wow.
Trainers give their Orkos on the Austin 

529
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,590
was killer,
killer whales.

530
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,651
The psychoactive jug.
Benzodiazepine according to the sworn 

531
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:04,381
affidavit filed in order to Ontario 
Superior Court of Justice in dispute 

532
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:07,981
between the park company to rival 
company marine land over the transport 

533
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:07,990
of a prize.
Killer whale.

534
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,290
I cake a cake.
Cake is if you watched blackfish,

535
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,080
you've got tillikum.
That's the one that killed people.

536
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,290
That's telecom son.
We had his son.

537
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,730
Wow.
We had him.

538
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:22,020
He was in captivity in captivity in a 
pool by himself.

539
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,220
The raised and bred and born in 
captivity it,

540
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,690
which is even more fucked up.
And he was turning aggressive and 

541
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:30,730
seaworld was like,
they were having none of it.

542
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,440
They wanted that killer whale back.
And I don't blame him.

543
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,620
It's amazing.
I'm sued for millions because I'm 

544
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:37,620
alleging that,
uh,

545
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,350
that marine land is mistreating their 
animals,

546
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,910
sea world,
sue's marine land because they're 

547
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,530
mistreating their not taking appropriate
care of the killer whale and actually 

548
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:46,530
win the lawsuit.

549
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,580
They would not put any barriers around 
the pool.

550
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,240
We've got a date or green.
I had a large pool.

551
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,420
Imagine this unimpeded.
Ability to touch a killer whale if you 

552
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,990
want it to reach.
It's not a safe idea.

553
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:57,070
This is absurd.
In fact,

554
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:58,750
especially when you're dealing with a 
large,

555
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,430
boisterous male Orca.
So seaworld wanted barriers around it so

556
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:04,690
that people can't get close.
Well,

557
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,880
the owner Marineland you can't tell him 
what to do.

558
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:08,860
He's not going to do nothing.
Anyone tells them what to do.

559
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:12,280
So suddenly we're dealing with the fact 
that this animal started to lunge at the

560
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:17,281
public.
Now this is an animal that if it gets a 

561
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:17,281
hold of someone,
it's over.

562
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:18,070
There's going to toy with them for a 
bit.

563
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,110
We're gonna hear a lot of screaming,
but the screaming will end.

564
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,530
You're not getting anyone out of out of 
that killer whales math,

565
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,580
forget it,
and this is what [inaudible] was dealing

566
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:24,700
with.

567
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,540
They're just like,
Shit.

568
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,270
They had enough bad press.
Even back then,

569
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,700
if I kick a kill someone or hurt someone
or anything or dies in Murraylands care,

570
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,730
it's gonna look bad on c one.
So see what it's like getting the fuck 

571
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:38,730
out now.
When tillikum killed people get killed,

572
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,531
how many people?
One person is granted a three to four 

573
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:44,180
actually in Victoria,
Canada,

574
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,070
the first one.
Then he went to a.

575
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,470
I think it's absolutely hilarious and 
they kept training them and doing things

576
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:52,240
with them.
That was a big deal.

577
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,320
That was a pit bull.
Forget about it.

578
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:54,340
It'd be done,
but it's a killer whale.

579
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,400
Almost any animal lion.
They were training,

580
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,860
you know,
lions and the lion killed someone.

581
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:00,730
They'd be like,
that's a wrap.

582
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,450
Unless that.
And that's not true.

583
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,290
One grizzly bear that was a train 
grizzly bear for films.

584
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,010
It was in,
what's that movie something 40 some 

585
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,200
football movie with a big bear.

586
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,660
Anyway,
uh,

587
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,510
the bear killed the guy's brother or 
cousin.

588
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,880
I was just standing there.
It's a horrible video.

589
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:23,200
You could watch the video.
I've seen it.

590
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,500
The guy just standing there and the bear
just decides to tear the guy's throat 

591
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:28,500
apart,
just reaches up,

592
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,920
bites him,
rips his throat open.

593
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,570
The guy runs off,
grabbed his neck.

594
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:35,560
He's dead within minutes.
The joys of working with animals,

595
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:36,520
man.
I mean they are.

596
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:41,521
They kept alive and they started 
training him again and there's some 

597
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:42,580
really weird footage of the guard 
training.

598
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:45,950
The Berrigan was the one from the 
welfare movie.

599
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,600
But semi-pro.
Yes.

600
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,110
Semi-Pro.
That's the dog or the dog.

601
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,020
Does the bear that bear fucking killed 
somebody.

602
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,540
Look,
this guy is smack in this bare ground.

603
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:00,550
Look at will that bear eventually killed
somebody just got tired of people.

604
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,350
It takes nothing for them.
Oh,

605
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,330
so easy for him?
Yeah.

606
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Just decided to fuck them up.
But now when telecom was doing all this,

607
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:12,950
he was on valium.
Oh,

608
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,830
I can't say for sure that that was the 
case in my suit anymore.

609
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,840
When did they start putting killer 
whales on volume?

610
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,260
Um,
so in,

611
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,870
in ocean oceanarium zoos or aquariums 
and Shit,

612
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,120
volume is often used as an appetite 
stimulant,

613
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:32,210
so when your animal is off off so they 
don't,

614
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,360
they don't eat.
If they're not responding to buckets of 

615
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:37,360
food,
you're fucked.

616
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,181
You having to drop the water to get 
access to it because they're not 

617
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:40,181
interested in them or they're not your 
friends anymore.

618
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:40,181
If you don't have a bucket of food,
forget about it.

619
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,210
And so to sort of off enough to sort of 
trigger that appetite,

620
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,570
you'll pump them with the value,
give them value,

621
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:48,630
and if they don't want to eat stuff that
written the phone,

622
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,950
you'd get liquid volume you can inject 
as well.

623
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,520
Well if necessary.
Oh,

624
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:54,110
the injections.
I mean that's a process.

625
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:57,440
The things that I've seen and done that,
that were normal to me,

626
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,780
normal.
Anyone who's working there is insane.

627
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:01,460
I mean we used to,
we used to drop,

628
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,850
we used to call this Beluga Rodeo and 
emory inland marina is notorious for 

629
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,421
having like we have,
I say we a over 50 that puts their 

630
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:14,381
pushing 60 balugas at this point.
And this is why it's so important to 

631
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:14,690
start changing these fucking laws 
because this is absurd.

632
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,720
And,
and it creates a whole world of 

633
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:19,720
problems.

634
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Of course,
socially for these animals,

635
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,930
a babies get killed by males.
It's,

636
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,200
it's.
Yeah,

637
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,240
it's gross.
It's bad.

638
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:25,160
It's not manageable.
Nonetheless,

639
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,900
what we would do is we would drop the 
water in one of the pool.

640
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,520
So you'd have anywhere between 10 and 15
balugas flat on their stomach.

641
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,980
There's a great at the bottom and they 
can't move.

642
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,830
They can't move well if they want to 
move,

643
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:38,510
they can,
but they're flopping around.

644
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,800
But it means they're going to get fucked
up.

645
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:42,230
Bad,
like scratched up by the ground.

646
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,330
So if you've got maybe a little bit of 
water,

647
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:49,331
we,
we've tried different things to try to 

648
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:49,340
mitigate how damaged up they got.
There was one time,

649
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,390
I mean,
they get carved up.

650
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:51,770
We used to call it,
I mean it's morbid,

651
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:54,200
but we used to joke around,
we called the Cesar water because it was

652
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,590
blood red by the time we were done 
procedures.

653
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,400
I'm telling you,
Joe,

654
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:03,401
it would make you sick.
It was the water was thick of blood and 

655
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:07,811
so one time there was a,
it was a Beluga name peanut and she 

656
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:10,670
started to panic and what she did was 
she repeatedly slander tail in a panic.

657
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,190
She started to bounce around like a 
fucking basketball.

658
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:14,510
She was getting air three feet in the 
air.

659
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,940
She was,
she's probably a 3000 pound a whale,

660
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,830
2000 pound whale or something.
So you're not going to stop that.

661
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,520
We tried.
Of course,

662
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:21,830
we jumped on her chunks of her tail.
I'm not joking.

663
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,130
Chunks of her tail flying off,
fly off.

664
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,350
If anyone goes to marine land,
go ask about peanut,

665
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:29,780
go take a look at her at her tail.
There's nothing left of it.

666
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:32,210
She's got like a nub that's sort of like
with Jag it on the bottom.

667
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,440
She was fucked up after that.

668
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,580
Again,
lots of meds,

669
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:37,310
lots of recovery,
but it was foul man.

670
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,740
So is this,
this Benzodiazepine,

671
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,100
is this a recent thing that they started
doing to?

672
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,130
No,
I wouldn't say so.

673
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:47,520
I can't vouch for anytime before 2000 
when I started,

674
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:52,521
but for sure once we were there,
and I mean when you go to seaworld and 

675
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:53,640
you see those killer whales and dolphins
doing shows,

676
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:55,770
there just pilled up out of their 
fucking minds.

677
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,650
It's A.
It's hardly assemble.

678
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,030
It's merely assemblance of their wild 
counterparts.

679
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:02,700
You're not going there and seeing a 
dynamic animal in the more you're seeing

680
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,380
a depressed,
drugged,

681
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,140
confused,
probably frustrated animal and I mean 

682
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,140
again,
what those,

683
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,990
what those animals go through it.
It's difficult for people to give a shit

684
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:14,580
about anything if it doesn't affect them
personally.

685
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,030
If you see an animal going through this,
it,

686
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,640
you feel it.
You start to appreciate it.

687
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,000
Like I feel weird even calling them 
animals.

688
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,770
I feel like I'm like killer whales and 
dolphins in particular,

689
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:30,800
so fucking intelligent.
It's,

690
00:27:30,801 --> 00:27:35,801
it's hard to call them animals.
I mean obviously humans are animals as 

691
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:37,770
well,
but they are their own thing.

692
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,430
I mean those marine mammals are their 
own thing.

693
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,140
They have their own world and they 
dominated it.

694
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,550
Yeah,
and in their world,

695
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:46,860
man,
it's a fucking amazing world.

696
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,400
This they.
They're one of the only animals that we 

697
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,581
know of that has a really complex 
language and we can't even decipher it.

698
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,520
And then just last week,
a marine land and Francis is talking 

699
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,070
about Wiki is a killer whale that just 
picked up a.

700
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,470
She mimics,
she mimics human voice.

701
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:05,790
So they've got her saying like,
hello,

702
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:06,720
hi.
And these different things.

703
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:08,730
And it sort of sounds like she's 
mimicking.

704
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,470
What if she started saying a bunch of 
racial shit,

705
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,910
racial slurs.

706
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,570
Well then let's get her candidate a band
capture of dolphins today.

707
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

708
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:23,241
But the capture is a,
it's already illegal in the United 

709
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:23,241
States,
right?

710
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:23,241
Well,
you,

711
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:24,570
you,
you have to go through the,

712
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,120
you can get them from Canada and Canada 
gets them from being captured under that

713
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,730
can get them from anywhere.
This.

714
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,760
So basically the department of fisheries
and oceans very strategically talked 

715
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,110
about this sweeping overhaul of the,
uh,

716
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,710
of uh,
whatever this their thing,

717
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:42,870
whatever it is,
or the words alluding me.

718
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,820
But um,
they did this,

719
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:46,730
I believe anyways,
sort of mitigate sort of.

720
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,640
Justin Trudeau went off about the kinder
Morgan pipeline sort of.

721
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,580
He ran.
It's that,

722
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,740
it's,
it's a big pipeline that they're going 

723
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:56,780
to run this oil in BC and there's a lot 
of protests,

724
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,650
what he ran on the campaign that he 
wouldn't do this,

725
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:03,730
you know,
Justin Trudeau talks about saving the 

726
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:03,730
world level time and cleaning up the 
environment.

727
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:03,900
So they've made this announcement.
Now that's a good,

728
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,700
that's a good piece of legislation.
Uh,

729
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,880
it doesn't bend the breeding,
it doesn't address a lot of the things 

730
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:10,880
that we're actually addressing with Bill
[inaudible],

731
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,510
which is the one that I spoke to you two
years ago,

732
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,400
that marine land has managed to get this
guy,

733
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,550
this senator to keep playing again,
acting the fool,

734
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,890
doing all these creative ways to kill 
this bill.

735
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,610
And,
uh,

736
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:21,550
that's where we're at now.
I mean,

737
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,720
I expect sometime next week to get an 
announcement that this bill should have 

738
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:26,730
been passed and brought into the house a
long time ago.

739
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,110
And uh,
you know,

740
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:30,480
not the case still still stalled at 
everything.

741
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:32,580
And again,
it's all lobbying illegal lobbying,

742
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:37,581
which may or may not turn into some 
problems for Senator Don Plett.

743
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,470
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but for while some of the,

744
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:41,980
some

745
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,980
of the parks in the United States would 
get them from some of the parks in 

746
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,281
Canada,
which would get them from Russians and 

747
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:50,281
Chinese who would capture them in the 
wild.

748
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:50,281
Right?
So,

749
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:55,021
so the parks,
the United States would say that they 

750
00:29:55,021 --> 00:29:57,571
don't capture whales.
So what they would do is marina would 

751
00:29:57,571 --> 00:29:57,880
capture a boatload of wild ones.
And then once,

752
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,720
uh,
uh,

753
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:01,860
they would do it personally while they 
would pay some Russians to,

754
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,090
to capture the Russians that they always
use.

755
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,190
Goddamn Russians.
Oh Man,

756
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,290
I'm not going to cheat at the Olympics.
They're stealing whales.

757
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,440
So they bring the whales in wild.
Those why those,

758
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,210
those whales have,
for instance,

759
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,850
a calf,
that calf is now deemed a,

760
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,660
a captive born and now it can be shipped
to the states.

761
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:24,661
And so,
so what marina was doing was just 

762
00:30:24,661 --> 00:30:24,661
breeding like crazy and then sending 
them to seaworld.

763
00:30:24,661 --> 00:30:26,170
And that's how we got the killer whale 
to begin with.

764
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,540
How we got Kaikos big trade with 
Balugas.

765
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,480
And,
and so that's,

766
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,350
we're trying to put an end to because 
all these loopholes,

767
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,970
you know,
marina really capitalized on this,

768
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:36,250
but they want a long time lobbying the 
government for years.

769
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,110
I mean they've been around for 50 plus 
years.

770
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,450
They've had,
they've done all the right moves.

771
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:45,550
A businessman would do if he wants to 
keep an a thriving business without too 

772
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,350
many hands sort of keeping him from 
doing anything.

773
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,440
It's just so disturbing that we're 
willing to just accept this because we 

774
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,530
don't know what they're saying.
You know,

775
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,530
we know that they have a really complex 
language.

776
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:01,650
We can't decipher it though because it's
so alien in terms of like the sounds 

777
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,830
that they make.
It's not something you put into a box,

778
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:07,831
but it's not like any other animal,
but you in dolphins and killer whales 

779
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:08,470
and Wales in general,
they,

780
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:13,471
they make sounds with a range of 
complexity that's just unrivaled in 

781
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,260
nature outside of humans.

782
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,450
And their auditory system is so complex.
When you put them in a,

783
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,740
we put them in a concrete pool.
Just imagine what I mean.

784
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,100
I put my ears under the water and it's 
loud.

785
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,440
The filters or goal and you've got 
different sounds.

786
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:26,890
I mean water being pushed in from this 
pipe and the screaming,

787
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,870
screaming louder.
Louder,

788
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:29,790
louder.
Pop gone.

789
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
The audience.
Yeah.

790
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,120
Yeah.
God Damn.

791
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,290
It's A.
I mean,

792
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,660
I look at them almost like they're kind 
of.

793
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,560
I mean they're definitely not human,
but they're are kind of people.

794
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,590
They're like a water people.
It's weird if you,

795
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,660
if you put yourself into a mindset of 
looking at an animal and and try to 

796
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:49,920
change your perception of them a little 
bit rather than,

797
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,810
than sort of disassociating and you look
and you start,

798
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,870
you can actually see that they're like,
they're people,

799
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,470
man.
Like that's,

800
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,770
that's just a different meat suit.

801
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Yeah.
Like when you deal with killer whales 

802
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,340
and stuff,
they evolved in a different environment,

803
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:05,920
but they evolved to be incredibly 
social,

804
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,250
highly dynamic populations.
They,

805
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,570
they live in these very intimate groups.
They stay together for life.

806
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,040
A male killer whale will never leave.
It's mother's side over its lifetime.

807
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,040
It'll stay within about a body's length,
its entire life.

808
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,100
Unless the positives beating on it.
Then I'll just stay on the outside of 

809
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,831
the pod for awhile.
At least they have that luxury of 

810
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:28,831
escape.
Whereas in captivity,

811
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:29,020
males get the shit kicked out of their 
big puppy dogs.

812
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,230
Big Male orchids,
I mean.

813
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,670
Yeah.
Okay.

814
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:34,470
They're murderous killing people,
but they're actually big puppy dogs.

815
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,330
They're there.
I've always felt so bad for candy.

816
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,860
We had this big male,
beautiful,

817
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:41,630
big bull male.
He was just.

818
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,290
He was rocked his existence,
having been pulled from his mother,

819
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,960
and this is really largely explains why 
telecom went off.

820
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,480
You ruined their lives.
That's over.

821
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,540
I mean their whole zone diet,
the reason they live member to their 

822
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,930
mother,
but fuck man.

823
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:59,150
It's just,
why do we allow this?

824
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,740
It seems to me like,
like almost a form of slavery.

825
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,930
I mean,
I don't want to diminish the horrors of 

826
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,781
human slavery because in human slavery 
at least there's no question whatsoever 

827
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,400
that that's a human and there's 
communication.

828
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,240
Yeah,
so it's.

829
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,680
It's as awful as it gets,
but God damn put the ignorance aside.

830
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,040
The slavery of killer whales is like 
really close.

831
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,430
It's really close.
The only way to get them to work 

832
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,370
effectively and efficiently is to keep 
them hungry.

833
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,710
Oh,
drug them and keep them hungry.

834
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,530
So yeah,
it's brutal.

835
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:35,180
Now is it still legal?
I mean,

836
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,560
isn't,
isn't seaworld,

837
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,100
aren't they expanding?
Didn't they just make a bigger a pool 

838
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,420
for the killer whales?

839
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,010
We gave them a bigger k.
yeah.

840
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:51,011
So what they've done is they've tried to
repackage the show as we're not doing 

841
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:51,011
the big dynamic show,
but they really still are.

842
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:52,370
They're like,
we're just showing natural behaviors,

843
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,940
which is bitch want natural behavior.
Let them go fuck up a whale.

844
00:33:55,941 --> 00:33:56,730
Shit.
They put fuck.

845
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,880
They put like a,
like a backdrop of a couple trees.

846
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:00,320
Assumption,
like a new show.

847
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,360
Hey seaworld.
There's one other crazy shit going on.

848
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:03,030
I mean in,
in,

849
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,100
in California.
Seaworld now.

850
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,410
See where promised to stop banning a 
rather.

851
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,090
They promised to stop breeding the 
killer whales,

852
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,720
but these fucking promises don't do not 
believe for a moment that they're like 

853
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,750
some type of responsible corporate 
citizens.

854
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:18,530
It's gonna.
Hold on to this thing.

855
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:19,940
It's bullshit.
And so we're an entity.

856
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,250
The business entity,
they're trying to make money and so what

857
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:24,680
California did was they went out and 
abandoned,

858
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,040
so in California you can't breed orkos.

859
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,480
I import export issues,
all that,

860
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,400
but in Florida,
so again,

861
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:32,450
see real mix,
the promise.

862
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,150
They had an Orca protection act that 
they were looking to do exactly.

863
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,170
California,
we're going to put it.

864
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:41,220
They were going to make it concrete 
passed the law that way that we see 

865
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,501
worldcat just backpedal on it,
but the road which everyone suspects 

866
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,110
they will see,
well there's lobbying like fucking crazy

867
00:34:45,111 --> 00:34:48,920
and just just last week,
successfully defeated the bill again.

868
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,980
They're putting a lot of the world is 
trying to defeat a bill though they 

869
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,581
successfully defeated multiple times,
including last week that allows them or 

870
00:34:57,581 --> 00:35:02,220
the bill,
the bill would keep them from breeding 

871
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,181
these animals in captivity,
so fighting against that successfully 

872
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:04,181
fighting.
It's over.

873
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:07,220
They're doing it in Florida.
While they're pretending in California,

874
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:08,480
they don't want to breed them.
Well,

875
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,230
no.
In California,

876
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:11,720
they actually passed the law,
the state of Florida.

877
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,200
It was defeated repeatedly and now fun 
last time.

878
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:20,410
So they're trying.
They're trying to breed animals in 

879
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:20,410
captivity and if they do breed them in 
Florida,

880
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,190
they'll be able to ship them to 
California to China,

881
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,430
so that's where the demand is right now.
And in fact seaworld was just bought by 

882
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,620
a large Chinese corporation.
They just named.

883
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,570
They just named one of the,
one of the guys to the seaworld board.

884
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,020
And so what people.
I mean it's safe to assume that this is 

885
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,130
exactly what's happening is zero.
This is

886
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,650
planning their exit strategy and they're
going to start sending their,

887
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,240
their orchestra to China.
Oh Geez.

888
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,000
It's a booming industry right now.
In fact,

889
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,780
kilowatt captivity is like if you can 
get in there and it's all coming out of 

890
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:50,780
Russia,
right?

891
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,090
Still.
But.

892
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,240
And so they're still capturing them in 
the wild.

893
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,270
Yup.
And in China it's,

894
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,960
it's a,
it's a burgeoning,

895
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:03,020
a booming industry man.
40 four ocean theme parks in China right

896
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,540
now.
Jesus is building a black crazy.

897
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,700
How many of them are in the United 
States?

898
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,910
How many aquariums?
Yeah.

899
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,880
I don't know.
I can't,

900
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,360
I can't say for sure.
I was actually surprised to read.

901
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,880
There's like 300 something dolphins in 
captivity in the states.

902
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:19,440
I had an,
I think that was the number I saw.

903
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:24,470
I didn't realize it was that big.
I had no idea that there was that many 

904
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:24,470
in captivity in the states.

905
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,160
It just seems to be such an archaic 
thing that.

906
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,220
And it just,
I can't imagine that the United States 

907
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,220
wants to keep doing that.
The fact that seaworld is trying to keep

908
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,101
doing that in Florida and if they've 
successfully lobbied to allow them to 

909
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:37,710
keep breeding these animals in 
captivity,

910
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,340
but you can't once you have them in 
captivity for a long time,

911
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:44,130
safe seaworld wanted to release them.
They can't really release them.

912
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:46,500
There's nowhere to release them.
And that's what's being worked on now.

913
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,220
There's a project called the whale 
sanctuary project and I,

914
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,360
I suspect there'll be,
uh,

915
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,460
a fairly large announcement soon.
I believe there'll be looking at a 

916
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,401
location in the,
in Canada and they're going to build 

917
00:36:58,401 --> 00:36:58,401
this thing though there will be a place 
for them,

918
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:00,240
which is a great place to do it because 
they do that.

919
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,890
Well.
You go coastal the course.

920
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:02,850
I mean,
you've got to be in the ocean,

921
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:04,050
you got a pen off an area,
you've got to.

922
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,250
I mean,
there's lots of things to consider.

923
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:07,170
You got to make sure there's a lot of 
water changes,

924
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:12,171
so a lot of different things because you
can't keep the animal and something 

925
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:12,171
that's gonna stagnate and either the 
minute,

926
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:16,490
so it's going to be some sort of a cage 
and assume a fence of sorts around that.

927
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,900
Maybe like a fjord.
I wouldn't be a fjord if it's in Canada,

928
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:23,901
but like just imagine jump it.
I imagined that they'll make certain 

929
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:26,310
that that's not going to be the case,
but it a while they can.

930
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,440
I've seen,
I've seen dolphins jump out of the pool.

931
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,780
That's crazy.
Yeah.

932
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Yeah.
I got rushed in one morning to a called 

933
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,111
them because uh,
because a dolphin jumped out of the 

934
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:38,111
pool.
Holy Shit that,

935
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:39,060
I mean,
that's a wake up call when you get there

936
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:40,440
and you see this thing flopping around 
and you're like,

937
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:42,690
Jesus Christ and I didn't do well.

938
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,010
You get the sling together.
First.

939
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,450
Authors,
you know,

940
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,460
we have these different slings and 
things that you know to move these 

941
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:49,460
dolphins.
So I was,

942
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:49,470
I was alone.
This was a dolphin way.

943
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,550
Yeah,
like 500 pounds,

944
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:51,800
600 pounds.
In this case she was,

945
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:56,850
she was a decent size female so I went 
and grabbed the kid out in the ticket 

946
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:56,850
booth or some shit cause it was too 
early in the morning.

947
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,310
I had no staff there.
Russia,

948
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,950
man.
I'm like,

949
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:00,240
dude,
I got two guys.

950
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:05,241
I'm like,
we gotta get this dolphin and these 

951
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:05,241
guys.
I mean if you've never done that before,

952
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,180
your jaws on the floor.
I fucking had these two steel poles all 

953
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,240
my shoulders.
Dolphin in the sling,

954
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,530
lifting her up.
I swear to you,

955
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:12,150
man.
My back went backwards like this.

956
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:13,530
It was the heaviest thing I'd ever 
carried,

957
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:14,460
but we got her back in.

958
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,620
It was crazy.
But yeah,

959
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:17,940
jumped out of the pool.
It was crazy.

960
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:19,830
In fact,
there was a time in the summer,

961
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,500
I remember where one of our dolphins was
teetering on the edge.

962
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,270
What you would do is she,
you know,

963
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,660
they're,
they're always spy hop and like this,

964
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:29,661
looking over the edge of the crowd.
Explain that to people that are just 

965
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:29,661
listening,
just listening.

966
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:30,570
So imagine there's like a short wall,
something that you know,

967
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:32,730
they can look over there,
sort of spy hop in there,

968
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:33,960
spying up to look.
Okay.

969
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,170
One of our dolphins learned that she can
actually jump up on the ledge and 

970
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,170
balance.
Now she was on that.

971
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,500
That's like an eight foot drop to the 
concrete on the other side of the pool.

972
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,050
She's up there posing.
I'm hearing the crowd.

973
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,790
I'm backstage.
I hear the crowd going crazy.

974
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:46,270
I'm like,
what is this?

975
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,800
I go there,
she'll have fun doing this.

976
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,600
Holy Shit.
That's the dolphin that jumped up.

977
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:52,360
So what we did was I said,
we got to take her out of this pool.

978
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:57,450
We took her out,
put her in the back pool where no one 

979
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:57,450
would see her.
Of course,

980
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:57,450
and that's the next day she actually 
jumped.

981
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,360
So she'd be dead today if we hadn't 
moved her.

982
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,400
Then of course all Marineland did was 
put up more,

983
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,680
you know,
more obstruction,

984
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:07,681
things to keep keep me in the pool.
So now when you find her outside of the 

985
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:07,870
pool,
how long had she been outside for?

986
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,430
She was still wet,
so it wasn't so bad,

987
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,300
but one a one dolphin was.
We found her that she,

988
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,500
she,
she got stuck on the stage overnight and

989
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:18,160
when we got there her skin had become so
dry that it was,

990
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,600
it was starting to crack.

991
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,600
It was kind of fucked up.
She actually has this permanent scar 

992
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:24,990
from her having tried.
Yeah.

993
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,260
And,
and a chunk come out.

994
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:31,350
Oh,
I don't know what she was probably 

995
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,850
thrashed.
Are you talking to her when you find or 

996
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:32,850
do you try to comfort her?
Like,

997
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:32,850
I mean,
yeah,

998
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,620
sure.
I'm hugging her and everything else.

999
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:39,621
Let's say she.
Did she calm down when she realizes 

1000
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:42,150
people were trying to help her?
Like are they aware of what's going on 

1001
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,640
or she in a pan?
They always fight.

1002
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,820
They always fight if they don't.
I mean this particular dolphin was a 

1003
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:47,820
fighter.
Every time we ever tried to put her in a

1004
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:47,820
sling and move on,
I mean,

1005
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,351
one time,
I love that I could go back in memories 

1006
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:55,951
and I can,
I can remember my thoughts during these 

1007
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:55,951
times.
And uh,

1008
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:57,220
we had her in a sling hovering over the 
pool and the way the sling is just,

1009
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:59,440
you've got two holes in the ceiling 
where the pecs go in,

1010
00:39:59,680 --> 00:39:59,980
right?

1011
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,860
The pectoral fins and then one where the
genital split is.

1012
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,040
So if they shit it doesn't wind up stuck
in the,

1013
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:05,800
in the sling,
but.

1014
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,780
And then you've got a crane,
a top.

1015
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,360
So now you've got this thing lifted over
the pool.

1016
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:11,290
Well,
she's fighting like crazy and we can see

1017
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:14,560
that there's a tear in the sling as 
she's fighting,

1018
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:15,100
fighting,
fighting.

1019
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:17,280
We get her.
The crane just gets rid of the pool,

1020
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,940
the sling rich,
he's plunked into the pool.

1021
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:20,820
Holy Shit Man.
And we've,

1022
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,200
we've slimmed out like 15,000
pounds,

1023
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,920
10,000
pounds killer whales over like 30,

1024
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:29,480
40 feet in the air.
Imagine one of those drops.

1025
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,900
Oh my God.
So that was sort of a wakeup call.

1026
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:33,740
Wow.
Yeah.

1027
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,900
Archaic Procedures,
man,

1028
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:36,820
moving these,
these things,

1029
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:41,821
the things that,
especially at a place like marine land 

1030
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:44,011
marina,
when you step through the doors and 

1031
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:44,011
hopefully you don't,
but if you do,

1032
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:44,011
it's like you've gone back to the 
seventies.

1033
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:49,110
Has any of this hurt their business?
Attendance is a bismal over there.

1034
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:51,910
They're crushed.
I live right.

1035
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:56,911
I.
I watched the sunset over marine land 

1036
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:56,911
from my front yard.
It's a beautiful site.

1037
00:40:56,911 --> 00:41:00,540
I drive by of course,
just about every day that their 

1038
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,630
attendance is rocked and Nag or falls,
which were.

1039
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,290
Which is where murray lender is,
is booming.

1040
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,380
The tourism is through the roof.
You can it's shoulder to shoulder over 

1041
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:10,380
there and greenland.
Seeing none of it.

1042
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,640
And you think it's because people know 
about the conditions.

1043
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,620
Absolutely.
Oh,

1044
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,560
I've got a lot of support in the local 
community.

1045
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:16,150
Like people know exactly what's going 
on.

1046
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,220
A tourist is a little more difficult 
than,

1047
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:20,140
you know,
Niagara Falls welcomes millions of them,

1048
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,490
so you're going to get a fraction of 
that,

1049
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:26,491
but it is a fraction.
Marineland is not benefiting from the 

1050
00:41:26,491 --> 00:41:26,491
booming tourism there.
They're on their way out.

1051
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
They're on a clock for sure.
For sure.

1052
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,960
I'd be shocked to hear them opening in 
2019 if I'm not going to make that 

1053
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,720
prediction,
but I would be shocked if it's that bad.

1054
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,960
But to be fair,
there's no investors that Marineland 

1055
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:40,960
it's one soul controlling mine,
owner who started with nothing.

1056
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,440
I started with 2000 bucks,
built this thing.

1057
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:44,810
He is indebted to nobody.
He's,

1058
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:50,270
you know,
he's cash Richard Course and he's got a 

1059
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:50,270
lot of fucking money and not a lot of 
times.

1060
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:50,990
So he's out to fuck shit up.
I wouldn't be surprised to know a lot of

1061
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:53,180
time in life.
You mean he's like 84 years old now?

1062
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,330
Yeah.
And so,

1063
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:55,440
uh,
I,

1064
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,680
I wouldn't be surprised to think that 
he's rationalized in his mind to just 

1065
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,850
fucking sewer this thing like destroy,
destroy all our lives.

1066
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:07,100
We're having spoken out,
but just tank the park in the process.

1067
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:08,360
Fuck it.
Wow.

1068
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,290
Yeah.
He's very defined.

1069
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:10,040
He's,
he's a,

1070
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,220
he's a very paranoid and defiant men.
And so,

1071
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,140
you know,
at 84 years old,

1072
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,430
what else does he have left to 
accomplish?

1073
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:19,050
I guess so you were saying they had 50 
Beluga whales,

1074
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:20,540
the plus,
maybe even 60 at this point.

1075
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,640
Beluga whales are huge.
Yeah.

1076
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,140
What is a big one way?

1077
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,530
I don't know if we've ever met.
If we ever actually weighed our big 

1078
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:31,530
metal gas at 4,000
pounds,

1079
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,190
maybe five.
You got 50 of those 50 of them.

1080
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:35,420
Yeah.
That's insane.

1081
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,770
Try Catching one.
Oh,

1082
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:39,020
I don't want to try.
I used to get tasked with,

1083
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:40,700
here's your.
Here's your scuba gear.

1084
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,920
Here's a.
A net the size of a football field.

1085
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:44,120
Good.
Catch that believable.

1086
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,160
Well,
me and my buddies would be like,

1087
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:47,510
okay,
here we go.

1088
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,680
Oh Dude,
you'd be.

1089
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,500
He'd be it.
It really would be amazing to be able to

1090
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,620
capture the things we've done on video.
Can you recognize the difference in 

1091
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,500
intelligence between killing whales,
dolphins,

1092
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:59,240
Beluga whales,
dolphins,

1093
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:04,270
dolphins,
and killer whales are remarkably 

1094
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:04,270
similar.
Just cunning.

1095
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,631
Smart.
You turn your back and they're 

1096
00:43:07,631 --> 00:43:07,631
pickpocketing you.
I mean they are just.

1097
00:43:07,631 --> 00:43:08,420
And they're brats and I love brats.
I mean they just are bratty animal.

1098
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,620
They're having fun.
They're having,

1099
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:14,650
while they're fucking with you,
they would like to make things 

1100
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:14,650
difficult.
If they know,

1101
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:15,170
if they know how to frustrate you,
they're going to exercise that.

1102
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:20,171
So it's always a mental game,
especially when you're dealing with 

1103
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:20,171
animals.
Treating with that was a Beluga.

1104
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:20,900
Whales are really timid,
so like,

1105
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:26,220
you know,
they call him the canaries of the sea 

1106
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,641
because it kind of skittish.
So I don't know if that's a reflection 

1107
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:28,660
of their intelligence necessarily,
but I would call them like maybe a,

1108
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,850
maybe a hint more dumb dumb than then 
the next one.

1109
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:33,530
Right.
But you know,

1110
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:34,940
they're more scared shitless of either 
not,

1111
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,560
you know,
because they don't really want it.

1112
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,610
They don't want to be,
they're not as smart as dolphins are.

1113
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,900
I wouldn't say so.
I mean it's wrong me in some way,

1114
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,460
some way.
Intelligent,

1115
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,500
you know,
they're sort of sitting ducks out there.

1116
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,020
Blue Goes.
I just mean like in the,

1117
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:48,650
in the,
in the,

1118
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,240
in the,
in the whale world,

1119
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,630
the whales respond,
they respond to verbal commands.

1120
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,340
Yeah.
So in the case of pinnipeds absolutely.

1121
00:43:58,341 --> 00:44:02,360
So seals and walruses a clc lines,
they re,

1122
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,010
they respond to verbal a whales.
We,

1123
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,060
I,
I couldn't say for sure in my experience

1124
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:12,440
that that was the case.
However,

1125
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:17,530
in the case of just that announcement 
last week of that animal mimicking the 

1126
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,200
human sounds,
it means she hears him.

1127
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,270
So if you can hear,
if the animal can hear you,

1128
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,740
you can definitely create a queue of 
sorts to trigger behavior.

1129
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,820
So it's possible that they could know 
some of our language.

1130
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,550
I don't know that they could recognize 
commands.

1131
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

1132
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,190
I wonder.
No,

1133
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,750
we,
we know that they have dialects,

1134
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,870
right?
But we don't know anything that they're 

1135
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:41,870
saying,
right?

1136
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:41,870
No.
Uh,

1137
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:42,920
and that's what's interesting is,
I mean,

1138
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:48,180
I sort of beat myself up wondering if in
fact they're using a language that is to

1139
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:54,231
be interpreted as words,
sentences versus sounds that mean 

1140
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,020
things.
I guess maybe that's what you're saying,

1141
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,180
but I know what you're saying.
It's not something that's necessarily 

1142
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:03,180
decipherable you know,
the,

1143
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:03,180
you know what a dog's pissed because 
they grow.

1144
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,710
A girl is different than a bark barks,
barks out necessarily words.

1145
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,700
And if they are,
maybe they're fuck you,

1146
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:13,701
I don't know,
but I was listening to this thing about 

1147
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:13,701
monkeys.
Um,

1148
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:16,050
I think it was Steven pinker's book 
where they were talking about,

1149
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,520
um,
it was the audio book.

1150
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:22,521
They were talking about how monkeys have
differentiated the sound that they make 

1151
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,920
if there is a tiger versus a sound they 
make.

1152
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,920
If there's an eagle anytime I'm walking 
around and I hear a squirrel in a tree 

1153
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,331
making a certain sound.
I know there's a cat in a vicinity 

1154
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:35,331
that's probably one of them,
but they have a language,

1155
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:37,830
like a very crude language.
But what they've done is taken the sound

1156
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,350
of an eagle and they play it near 
monkeys.

1157
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,790
The monkeys look up,
of course,

1158
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:46,791
and they play the sound of a monkey 
trying to alert the fact that there's a 

1159
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:49,320
tiger in the area and the monkeys run up
trees and start looking down.

1160
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,380
Yeah.
It's really interesting because like 

1161
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,570
they have a few sounds that they can 
repeat and they know for a fact that 

1162
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,180
these monkeys know what they're talking 
about.

1163
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:59,610
And monkeys even played jokes.
That's a language with each other.

1164
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,880
They play jokes on each other,
like if one monkey wanted a banana,

1165
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,880
he would say,
hey man is a fucking eagle here,

1166
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:09,510
and the monkey would run up the tree and
he would get the banana like they would.

1167
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,940
They lie to each other.
Just pretty fascinating.

1168
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,100
It makes doing fucked up things to them 
that much worse,

1169
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:18,390
right?
You mean monkeys a mean?

1170
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:23,391
We know that they're intelligent,
but they got a little tiny little tiny 

1171
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:26,031
brain.
Little tiny has had little tiny brain 

1172
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:26,031
know,
but it's all I need orcas,

1173
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:27,750
brain,
those giant.

1174
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,520
These are huge,
enormous brains.

1175
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,440
Dolphins.
Brains are dolphin.

1176
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:33,690
Brains are way bigger than ours.
You want to hear a fucked up story?

1177
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,700
I had to dig up a dead killer whale to 
extract a portion of its brain that we'd

1178
00:46:37,701 --> 00:46:40,680
missed during a necropsy.
You have to dig it up.

1179
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,960
Yeah.
It was ground that was in the ground.

1180
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,790
He had been married for like 10 days to.
Whoa.

1181
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,450
Oh Dude.
How'd he die?

1182
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,570
I can't remember how candy died exactly,
but he did.

1183
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,830
He died pretty young.
Um,

1184
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,850
I can't remember exactly what the final.

1185
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,640
We never got that information as as 
trainers,

1186
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,140
you sort of.
We're always told,

1187
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:01,740
oh,
it was,

1188
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,230
you know,
it's always a meningitis.

1189
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,460
It op.
He died of meningitis or,

1190
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,250
or they would say,
oh,

1191
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,750
twisted and testing or something.
They always came up with things that you

1192
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:12,480
just know.
It kept you asking questions rather than

1193
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:14,730
feeling like anything was ever 
conclusive in that regard.

1194
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,580
But on this particular case,
or in this particular case,

1195
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,830
the vet had pulled me aside and said,
okay,

1196
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:23,790
I gotta ask you something fucked up.
Can you go get two people sued them up.

1197
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,700
We got to go get a piece of the brain.
We missed of candy.

1198
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:27,730
I'm just like,
ugh.

1199
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,250
I can't possibly impose

1200
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,470
upon someone to do that.
I can't.

1201
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,580
Deep Deepa had been buried like it's 
booked six,

1202
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,000
eight feet.
He was,

1203
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:42,810
and you could just do that in the yard.
They allow you to just bury it in the 

1204
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,070
yard.
Maryellen has mass graves in the back in

1205
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,260
the exact place that they're claiming 
development now,

1206
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:52,261
which I've got some overhead shots.
They've acted like paving roads pretty 

1207
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:54,930
close to it to where the bodies are 
buried and what,

1208
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,640
like how many different things you think
are buried?

1209
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,440
Thousands.
Thousands.

1210
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,030
I mean just in deer alone.
Forget about.

1211
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,040
I mean,
greenland breeds more deer and why do 

1212
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,040
they breed dear?
He's got.

1213
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,580
He's got a whole park of animals,
different animals.

1214
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:12,210
That's where the,
the animal cruelty charges stemmed from 

1215
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,041
was actually was not marine mammals 
because there's no laws protecting them 

1216
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:14,140
so that they continue to live in a void 
of protection.

1217
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,100
But the,
the,

1218
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,470
the deer's,
the bears.

1219
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,680
There's no laws in Canada,
in Canada yet.

1220
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,700
It's coming,
man.

1221
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,440
And I've been talking about this for 
five years.

1222
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:28,441
We're almost there,
but I'm up against the fucking wall 

1223
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:28,441
first.
Come on here.

1224
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:31,180
Two thousand 13 was my first time here.
Yeah.

1225
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:36,181
So that would have been four years ago.
So they have thousands of graves in the 

1226
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:36,620
back.
Thousands of animals in,

1227
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,830
in large graves.
So this big hole for instance,

1228
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:41,100
there's a big hole for the deer.
They're all going in there.

1229
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,430
The theory or the eat them,
it used to back in Christmas,

1230
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,740
uh,
back in the day when he used to,

1231
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,120
when the owner used to host Christmas 
parties,

1232
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:54,121
he'd go back and slaughter a,
buys it and then feed burgers and make 

1233
00:48:54,121 --> 00:48:54,121
food out of stuff.
And they used to do that.

1234
00:48:54,121 --> 00:48:54,340
They don't do it no more.

1235
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,160
They actually used to be called a uh,
uh,

1236
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,500
something in game farm.
And then by,

1237
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:03,400
by being a farm classified as a farm,
he was actually able to kill them,

1238
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:04,820
produced food.
So that's something I,

1239
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,030
I,
I've been told that happened now.

1240
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:11,590
Why did they kill deer back there?
Why go to a whole?

1241
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:12,630
Well,
I mean,

1242
00:49:12,631 --> 00:49:15,220
a lot of them die because their gross.
First off,

1243
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:16,750
when you got 500 deer in a,
in a,

1244
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,720
in a pen,
that's like disgusting.

1245
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,900
They're not all gonna get to eat.
Some of them are going to get injured.

1246
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:28,080
These things happen.
So at night what would happen is 

1247
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,670
someone,
let's say we'd drive around in his 

1248
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:32,670
truck,
you know,

1249
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:32,670
put the gun out the window and just eat 
it.

1250
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,800
Just go on the shooting sprees,
wiping out these animals in the morning.

1251
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:37,480
The land animal care guys would show up 
and it'd be like,

1252
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:37,900
okay,
go,

1253
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,420
go pick up the bodies and these poor 
kids.

1254
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,630
So what do you do it for a goof or what 
do you do it because he's trying to thin

1255
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:45,370
the population because there's too many 
of them.

1256
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:46,870
Oh No,
it wouldn't be anything like that.

1257
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,980
Well,
in one case,

1258
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:50,440
once the,
once the investigation came out in 2012,

1259
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,380
which revealed of course abuse with land
animals as well,

1260
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,900
uh,
they went on a calling spree,

1261
00:49:55,901 --> 00:50:00,901
if you will,
where they got rid of some of the 

1262
00:50:00,901 --> 00:50:00,901
uglier,
sort of less healthy animals.

1263
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:01,970
It's funny because.
Yeah,

1264
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,720
because marina actually breathes the 
more beautiful deer off site.

1265
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,050
The more beautiful animals that they 
have on are not on display.

1266
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:10,420
They're actually back there breeding off
out of display.

1267
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:15,570
That's where the two dogs,
I don't know if you recall when the 

1268
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,431
owners shot those two labs,
beautiful little labrador dogs went 

1269
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,911
running into the,
up and down the running up and down the 

1270
00:50:20,911 --> 00:50:20,911
fence across from,
you know,

1271
00:50:20,911 --> 00:50:20,911
murraylands owner's house.

1272
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,370
Which is where the offsite Penn is,
where he breathes the animals and that's

1273
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:28,160
where he decided,
I'm not calling anyone to come get these

1274
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,930
analysts do the story.
So heartbreaking.

1275
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,820
He just pulled out a shotgun,
kills one.

1276
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,750
The other one cowers because there was a
witness.

1277
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,330
Of course the witness never identified 
themselves.

1278
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:42,490
They didn't want to be sued and then he 
shoots the other one and then he tells a

1279
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:45,440
land animal care supervisor takes these 
as take the collars off the dogs,

1280
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:47,660
go bury him in the pit.
It was.

1281
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,790
I was there that day.
I heard the gunshots.

1282
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:51,890
I was there when the vet got the phone 
call and she's like,

1283
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,090
oh my God,
okay.

1284
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:53,840
She hangs up.
She looked at me.

1285
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:55,370
He goes,
John just killed two dogs.

1286
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:56,750
I'm like,
what the fuck man?

1287
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,850
Dogs that you can go,
hey,

1288
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,170
go back home.
Poppy's dude.

1289
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:03,830
They were beautiful dogs.
There was a video.

1290
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,810
It's since been taken down on the trump 
star website.

1291
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,840
A lot of the videos are gone.
A lot of things are happening now on 

1292
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,151
account of these lawsuits and further 
down the road that we've gone where 

1293
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:13,151
things are starting to disappear.
There was a,

1294
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:18,320
it was a very powerful historical 
website about marine and some of the 

1295
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,270
owners history and you know,
these things are gone now.

1296
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,240
They're gone.
I mean,

1297
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,900
I can't allege as to why or what 
agreements are.

1298
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,330
If there are agreements,
I can't go down that road to suggest,

1299
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:29,110
I don't know,
but a lot of these resources that I,

1300
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,850
that were very powerful are,
are gone and disappearing now.

1301
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,620
So he's.
This marine land has this giant yard,

1302
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:41,621
right?
How many acres are you talking about 

1303
00:51:41,621 --> 00:51:41,621
where there's thousands of animals 
breed.

1304
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,550
I mean,
the park is massive.

1305
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,560
It is.
There's more,

1306
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,560
there's probably three times undeveloped
land versus what's develop there.

1307
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:50,600
And it's a big park.
It's sort of barren.

1308
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:55,601
There's not a lot of things.
His rides and you got to walk a mile in 

1309
00:51:55,601 --> 00:51:55,601
between them,
but nonetheless,

1310
00:51:55,601 --> 00:51:55,610
uh,
the owner,

1311
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:56,490
what do you like to do?
Was,

1312
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:59,460
was sort of acquire a lot of land over 
his lifetime that,

1313
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:01,870
that was his thing.
He owns half an agora fault.

1314
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,710
I got to watch what the hell I stepped 
because any given point,

1315
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,910
if I'm.
If I'm on their land,

1316
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,950
I'm getting charged with trespassing,
whether I like it or not.

1317
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,310
In fact,
the city of Niagara Falls leased land to

1318
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:13,160
marine land to keep protesters off of 
their site,

1319
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,180
which is absolute bullshit and if 
anyone's listening from city council,

1320
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:22,181
I'm hope you do,
you've got to fix that because that's 

1321
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,711
some horse shit right there and then 
that you guys had been pandering to on 

1322
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:23,711
for too long.

1323
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:24,110
I mean to keep us from being able to 
protest.

1324
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,310
That's horse shit.
Sorry.

1325
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:30,530
Why do you think that is?
Because they just don't want to get 

1326
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:33,161
sued.
There was a time when marine land and 

1327
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:33,161
owner were called like the king of 
Niagara.

1328
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,060
That was it.
Marine land was a top.

1329
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,940
The hill that was the falls came second 
to marine land,

1330
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:39,230
or at least marineland played the,
the.

1331
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,210
This idea that people came to Niagara 
Falls,

1332
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:46,450
they would see the false.
They'd say they'd look at him for 10 

1333
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:46,450
minutes and then they would have no 
reason to stay.

1334
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:50,680
They were saying they're bringing all 
this business because people are now 

1335
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:50,860
going to a hotel,
it's going to restaurants and it's going

1336
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:53,390
to marine land the next day.
And so when did this change?

1337
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:55,970
When did marine land go to shit?
Yeah,

1338
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,150
2012.
So right when you left.

1339
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,780
So before then it was this thriving 
thing and just nobody knew about the 

1340
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,030
conditions.

1341
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:10,290
That's what it was,
were ignorant of people wouldn't have 

1342
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,431
known who's going to talk.
It's not new for murraylands owner or 

1343
00:53:12,431 --> 00:53:12,680
marina and the corporation to sue people
for speaking out.

1344
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:17,681
They did it before and successfully.
Not in the sense that there was any 

1345
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:17,681
judgment,
but successfully in that the people that

1346
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:20,780
spoke had to pay a horrible price and 
you know,

1347
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:25,781
essentially got silenced.
So no one wants to speak out against 

1348
00:53:25,781 --> 00:53:25,781
that.
No,

1349
00:53:25,781 --> 00:53:26,580
I don't blame them.
I get it.

1350
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,660
I mean,
I'm eating it now.

1351
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:32,661
It's been five years,
five years of everyday waking up 

1352
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:32,661
wondering if this is the one where 
you're done,

1353
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:36,621
you know.
So you've been embroiled in these 

1354
00:53:36,621 --> 00:53:36,621
lawsuits for five years.
Five years on,

1355
00:53:36,621 --> 00:53:40,640
on.
They sued me on Valentine's Day of 2013 

1356
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,541
yet and nothing's been resolved.
The only way that there could be a 

1357
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:49,710
resolve at this point is if I were to 
sign a document and I'm,

1358
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,040
I'm assuming at this point because 
Murraylands sent nothing in terms of any

1359
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:58,041
type of agreement,
but you know down the road it's their 

1360
00:53:58,041 --> 00:53:58,041
objective is to shut me up.

1361
00:53:58,041 --> 00:53:59,280
They want to wipe out the last 20 years 
of my life.

1362
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,620
They don't want me to open my mouth 
about anything in of course,

1363
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:06,621
in the last five years and then the 
twelfth prior when I sort of revealed 

1364
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:06,621
everything that's going on,
they're trying to shut me up.

1365
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,000
They want me.
They want an injunction,

1366
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:09,470
a permanent injunction.
I assume they would.

1367
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:15,110
That to keep me from being able to go to
the park with this becomes very 

1368
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,280
conflicting for me because they have my 
walrus sort of hostage there and I do.

1369
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:22,370
I do dream of a day of being reunited 
with her and I imagine that would have 

1370
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:22,370
to take place on marine land property 
someday.

1371
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:25,680
So it's really not prepared to sign 
anything.

1372
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:27,420
In fact,
I told my lawyer just last week,

1373
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:31,830
it's a nonstarter and I'll remind marine
land now nonstarter.

1374
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,330
They'll never shut me up.

1375
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,690
I'm not signing it.
I'll have to eat shit forever,

1376
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,700
but I'm not going to sign it.
So where do you anticipate this all 

1377
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:40,700
going?
I mean you've been,

1378
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,050
you know,
prolong legal battle for five years now.

1379
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,320
Where do you anticipate this going?
And so in April.

1380
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:47,940
So last time I was here two years ago,
I,

1381
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,140
you know,
I solicited some,

1382
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:52,500
some,
some help resources to be able to pursue

1383
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:55,230
murraylands owner in that I want him to 
be examined in court,

1384
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:00,231
much like I have in the same capacity 
that I had to forfeit all of my 

1385
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:02,931
communications.
I want the same for the corporation and 

1386
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:02,931
I want to examine murraylands owner as 
representative.

1387
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:05,040
This proved very difficult.
It took A.

1388
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,820
I mean we got the ordered only just last
April to examine him.

1389
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:13,821
We got,
we won the order and since then we've 

1390
00:55:13,821 --> 00:55:15,600
tried multiple times to schedule and 
we're,

1391
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,720
we're almost a year now of trying to 
schedule this man to come in for 

1392
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,661
examinations and he's not shown up a 
couple times now and so at some point if

1393
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:29,400
marine land doesn't want the facts out 
there and that's what I'm pursuing,

1394
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:32,550
I want the facts out there,
they're going to have to,

1395
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,010
they're going to have to settle and so 
how that ends with me,

1396
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:38,670
I don't know.

1397
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:43,700
I'm not looking for money.
I could give a shit about trying to get 

1398
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,221
rich in this thing.
Are you trying to sue them for money 

1399
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:46,221
though?
I'm suing them.

1400
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:46,221
Yeah,
but it's a much.

1401
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:46,260
Well,
the numbers don't matter,

1402
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,940
but that's like a million and a half or 
something.

1403
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,800
They defame the shit out of me.
Let's be honest.

1404
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,170
It's pretty absurd.
But again,

1405
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,410
so would the million and a half.
I'd never get it.

1406
00:55:55,470 --> 00:56:00,470
I'll never see it.
But would it be a predicated on you 

1407
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,280
would have to shut your mouth if it 
wasn't something that went.

1408
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,350
If it wasn't a judgment that the judge 
made,

1409
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,550
for instance,
we went to trial,

1410
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:08,580
the judge makes their decision.
Then if we settled beforehand,

1411
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:10,800
it's because everyone wants to wash 
their hands and walk away.

1412
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:15,450
We're not going to wash their hands of 
me unless I feel,

1413
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:17,040
unless I've got them properly cornered.

1414
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,990
The only way they want to get me is,
well,

1415
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,160
of course they want to ruin me.
Right?

1416
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,680
How can you properly corn to them?
What be well,

1417
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,980
if murraylands owners missed a couple 
examinations now how many until I can go

1418
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:31,360
in and actually file a motion to have 
the entire statement of claim dismissed?

1419
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,940
Well,
the fact is pretty soon,

1420
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:37,060
so my objective is to go and get this 
lawsuit thrown out.

1421
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:42,090
At which point they've only got.
I've got the counterclaim for them to 

1422
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:42,090
work with.
They're not suing me no more.

1423
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:43,300
Now who's got the upper hand?
That's my dream.

1424
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,890
That's your dream.
But if,

1425
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:50,590
if that doesn't happen,
I mean it seems like five years is a 

1426
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:51,470
long time to be in the prolong legal 
battle.

1427
00:56:51,471 --> 00:56:56,471
Like at what point in time,
but does it become so absorbed that the 

1428
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:56,770
court throws it out?
So it just happened.

1429
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,890
Now it's actually a new rule that as of 
February 2018,

1430
00:56:59,891 --> 00:57:04,891
any lawsuit that hasn't been scheduled 
for a four trial was administratively 

1431
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:11,340
dismissed.
There's a new law and so that doesn't 

1432
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:16,201
affect mine unfortunately because we 
actually fought to get a case 

1433
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:18,961
management,
a judge on our case be on my case 

1434
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:19,270
because like I said,
Greenland's acting the fool.

1435
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,610
I can't seem to get in front of a judge.
Everything's joke around.

1436
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:23,860
So we went and won that again.
It took a long time.

1437
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:29,010
You know,
what's the crazy thing about these 

1438
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:29,010
lawsuits?
And I,

1439
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:29,010
I see now of course in 2012 was a lot 
more naive,

1440
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,840
but all of the wins that I get in court 
cost me.

1441
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,460
So for instance,
I,

1442
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,800
I,
I defend a motion against marine land.

1443
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:39,730
It costs me $7,500.
The judge says,

1444
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:41,800
okay,
Phil wins this round.

1445
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,530
Let's give them some money back on a 
partial indemnity.

1446
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,000
He gets 3,500
bucks back.

1447
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,060
It's not just cost me four grand 
murraylands owner Mrs.

1448
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:54,180
Examination as as an example,
I've got to get what's called a 

1449
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,090
certificate of attendance.
I got to send a lawyer 1200 bucks.

1450
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:59,380
So it's.
And how is all this funded now?

1451
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:00,820
Oh,
I have a public go fund me.

1452
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:05,821
Of course.
I've had several and how do people if 

1453
00:58:05,821 --> 00:58:08,131
they want to donate,
because I'm sure a lot of people 

1454
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:08,131
listening to this like,
fuck this man.

1455
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:08,410
I got to help this guy saved 
smooshy.com.

1456
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:10,870
I've got my documentary on there,
which I'd like to touch on a little bit.

1457
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:12,130
It's great if you had a chance to look 
at it,

1458
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:12,550
watch.
Oh,

1459
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,600
okay.
Well if you get.

1460
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,520
If you manage to.
It's.

1461
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,730
It's pretty.
It's good.

1462
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:17,740
These kids from Ryerson University did 
it.

1463
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,800
Brave kids and how I know it's a very 
effective law or a documentary is that 

1464
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,670
marine land didn't sue them.

1465
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,010
They know the danger of this 
documentary.

1466
00:58:27,011 --> 00:58:32,011
They know how powerful it is and they 
didn't sue him and that's how I know 

1467
00:58:32,011 --> 00:58:35,760
that this is powerful and so they 
decided that it's so good they have to 

1468
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,511
leave it alone and just ignore it 
because if they sue them then it'll put 

1469
00:58:39,511 --> 00:58:39,511
attention to.
Exactly.

1470
00:58:39,511 --> 00:58:40,360
And so they made a small statement 
saying,

1471
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:42,310
Oh,
this is Phil just doing what Phil does.

1472
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,170
And it's funny because the Ryerson 
students turned out to be.

1473
00:58:44,171 --> 00:58:45,550
They go,
but that's not true.

1474
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:46,960
Like we came to you.
They just went.

1475
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:48,580
They actually wanted to do it five 
minutes.

1476
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,470
A personal profile of me.
They said,

1477
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:55,650
look,
we want to just do a quick interview 

1478
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:55,650
with them.
Like sure.

1479
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:55,650
That morning,
I don't know.

1480
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,190
They come in the right day.
I just,

1481
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,570
you know,
we spoke for hours and then they sort of

1482
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:03,571
got back and said,
know we want to do like maybe something 

1483
00:59:03,571 --> 00:59:03,571
more with this.

1484
00:59:03,571 --> 00:59:03,571
I'm not asking you guys do whatever the 
hell you want.

1485
00:59:03,571 --> 00:59:03,910
I mean I'm,
I'm,

1486
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,730
I'm an open book.
I'd give everything away.

1487
00:59:06,731 --> 00:59:08,890
You want something here,
go go nuts with it.

1488
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,810
And so they did and they did something 
great.

1489
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,910
It's really good and uh,
so,

1490
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,560
you know,
definitely,

1491
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,940
definitely.
Please check that out.

1492
00:59:15,941 --> 00:59:17,390
You know,
we'll do it every time I talk to you,

1493
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,030
I'm happy to talk to you.
You're a great guy.

1494
00:59:19,031 --> 00:59:22,960
But we always get fucking hugely sales 
conversations.

1495
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,590
I'm always just like,
what?

1496
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:28,760
Fuck.
And now the volume do it.

1497
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:31,490
If I have to get into my own personal 
wellbeing.

1498
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,040
I mean you get compromised when things 
like this happen.

1499
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,120
You do,
you just do.

1500
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:38,000
I imagine it's a half a decade of 
stress.

1501
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:40,340
It's a lot big portion,
but I'm turning 40 in a month.

1502
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:44,960
So from 35 to 40,
34 all been stress in lawsuit everyday.

1503
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,810
And not just that they're sending goons 
to my house.

1504
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:49,550
I mean they sent the police to my house.
I mean,

1505
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,810
it,
it,

1506
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,620
it,
it really is relentless.

1507
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,200
It's absurd.
The things that he.

1508
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,580
There was a comedian,
I don't want to mention his name because

1509
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,190
he deleted the tweet that he.
And he told me,

1510
00:59:58,191 --> 00:59:59,090
Oh,
twitter deleted.

1511
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:04,091
It was bullshit.
So I'm not gonna I don't want to give 

1512
01:00:04,091 --> 01:00:04,091
him any attention,
but Peta had tweeted something and so he

1513
01:00:04,091 --> 01:00:05,690
quoted that tweet and said,
it's time to burn.

1514
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:07,700
This place is a comedian.
Very funny.

1515
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:11,060
I click retweet.
I got the police,

1516
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:16,100
uh,
cyber crimes unit on my front door the 

1517
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:16,250
next day because the lawyer sent them 
because I,

1518
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,190
uh,
I,

1519
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,200
uh,
inciting violence incited violence for 

1520
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,001
the followers.
So now marina was worried that the 

1521
01:00:25,001 --> 01:00:25,001
buildings are going to be burned down.

1522
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:29,210
Well,
I would never say to do that mean either

1523
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,000
fuck them or I would never tell anyone 
to fly a drone over it.

1524
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:35,750
Either opportunity for million view 
youtube hits.

1525
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:36,470
Yeah,
don't do it.

1526
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:40,910
Don't do that man.
It's just,

1527
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,680
you know,
that they're on the wrong side of 

1528
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:47,960
history and not just marine land,
but all of these places,

1529
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:53,350
all these places like there's gonna come
a time in the future where people look 

1530
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:57,251
back at this kind of captivity of these 
hyper intelligent social animals stolen 

1531
01:00:58,131 --> 01:01:01,670
from their families.
It's a terrible,

1532
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:07,120
terrible statement about human beings.
The thing I love about,

1533
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:14,590
I guess,
what you would call them a my campaign 

1534
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:16,700
is that I have support from hunters.
I have support from vegans.

1535
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:19,610
I am across the spectrum.
At one point I had a far right,

1536
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,490
well personally is perceived as a far 
rates,

1537
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,700
uh,
uh,

1538
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,170
uh,
Internet personality.

1539
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:29,230
Tweet my,
a documentary and then Rosie O'donnell 

1540
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:29,240
tweets it and she's left as it gets.
And so I'm looking at.

1541
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,920
Yeah,
yeah.

1542
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:31,940
Wow.
Oh Dude.

1543
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:33,920
I got a rosy story.
It's kind of heartbreak or actually,

1544
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:36,440
but when I went to New York,
and again,

1545
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:38,260
Joe,
thank you so much for when you,

1546
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,310
when you spoil me with those ufc 
tickets,

1547
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:43,970
do that.
It's always the most timely thing and so

1548
01:01:43,971 --> 01:01:45,170
appreciate it because it's,
it's,

1549
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:50,350
it's just like this trip,
it's exactly what I need at the time to 

1550
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:51,080
start.
Keep myself a little break and have some

1551
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:53,370
fun.
And so I was going in New York City,

1552
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:54,010
know what I'm saying?
Message.

1553
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,500
I'm like,
dude,

1554
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,200
and you're like,
Bro.

1555
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,170
And I'm like,
ah.

1556
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:02,000
And so,
so rosy sees the documentary and someone

1557
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:02,630
says to me,
hey,

1558
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:03,890
rosie just tweeted a documentary.
I'm like,

1559
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:06,080
oh cool,
so I go to her twitter and shit.

1560
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:11,740
So I followed her.
She followed me back just to send me 

1561
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:11,740
messages like,
dude,

1562
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:11,810
like it's really powerful.
I really like.

1563
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,150
And then she goes to elaborate like,
I want to know more about you,

1564
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,070
want to call you tomorrow.
Okay,

1565
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:17,190
cool.
Sure.

1566
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,230
As Shit.
The next day the phone rings.

1567
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:19,110
I'm talking to Rosie.
I'm like,

1568
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:20,360
this is crazy.
I'm again,

1569
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,420
I'm for.
I know who rosie is.

1570
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:26,421
I don't know if these days.
If kids know who Rosie Rosie O'donnell 

1571
01:02:26,421 --> 01:02:26,421
was like,
I don't know.

1572
01:02:26,421 --> 01:02:29,541
She was a heavy in my daily.
She's left a powerhouse and she's 

1573
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:29,541
expressing all these interests.
Like,

1574
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:29,580
you know,
I've,

1575
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,260
I've,
I've done documentaries,

1576
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,230
I've released them on Hbo,
you know,

1577
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,560
I've done all these things.
I'm going to,

1578
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,010
I'm going to La Tomorrow and I'm gonna 
call you back on Friday,

1579
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:42,180
but I'm meeting with this emmy award 
producing a producer and we're gonna get

1580
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:42,810
this thing out there.

1581
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:47,810
And then she starts to say,
and this is where my heart starts to 

1582
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:47,810
ache,
is that,

1583
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,021
you know,
you always sort of hope that there's 

1584
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:51,021
going to be a hero that,
I mean,

1585
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:51,021
especially the last five years,
it's gonna be like,

1586
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:51,150
you know what,
enough's enough,

1587
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:52,200
let's,
let's do this.

1588
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,930
And especially in the case of with my 
Walrus,

1589
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,730
she starts saying,
I think we can get the Walrus,

1590
01:02:57,731 --> 01:03:00,360
like we can get some pressure,
get a TV network pressure.

1591
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:01,800
So let's get that Walrus.
I'm just like,

1592
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:06,801
dude,
you're pulling on my fucking heart 

1593
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:06,801
strings now.
I,

1594
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:08,010
you know.
And then I went to New York,

1595
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,220
I'd hope to have lunch with rosie on 
that particular trip.

1596
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:16,250
I was going for two reasons,
actually was also was hoping to do some 

1597
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,150
Iowasca I'm looking to get a reset.
Oh I,

1598
01:03:17,151 --> 01:03:17,940
I,
I need some.

1599
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,740
I'm going to do that soon.

1600
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,610
Sooner than later.
But that was,

1601
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:22,380
that was the intention of going to New 
York.

1602
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:28,070
And uh,
and since then it's just been radio 

1603
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:28,070
silence from Rosie,
unfortunately.

1604
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:32,540
And I,
I accept that in that she has a 

1605
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:32,540
complicated world and whatnot.
But man,

1606
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,070
she pulled on my heartstrings,
don't,

1607
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,630
might've wanted to do it and couldn't 
and I'm not going to fall.

1608
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,120
I see how crazy sort of her life and 
sort of things that go on in the end.

1609
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,580
Totally.
You know,

1610
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,360
she's got a lot of family issues and all
sorts of other stuff too.

1611
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:46,260
But yeah,
that's a bummer.

1612
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,350
It's just a bummer is what it is.
I think uh,

1613
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:53,360
also people get involved with you and 
hear the stories and then they get 

1614
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,210
scared of being sued themselves all the 
time.

1615
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,560
Yeah,
you should see it.

1616
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:56,190
I mean,
I just,

1617
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:57,880
even last week I contacted someone that,
uh,

1618
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:01,290
I mean the media now and mind you,
it's a very different landscape now from

1619
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:02,470
2012,
2012.

1620
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:07,470
The media was against me.
Corporate media was in Rhode and had 

1621
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:07,950
them in their back pocket.
That was before blackfish.

1622
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,450
Two thousand 13,
2014,

1623
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:10,860
7:15
media's mine,

1624
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,450
2016,
17,

1625
01:04:12,451 --> 01:04:13,680
18.
Now the media is just,

1626
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,630
who knows what the fuck they're doing,
man.

1627
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:18,870
Like it's all over the map.
So it's hard to get any sort of.

1628
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:21,480
And again,
Marineland will sue them.

1629
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,750
So it's also an issue of after things 
had been going on for so long and 

1630
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,600
nothing's happened,
people start going,

1631
01:04:27,601 --> 01:04:28,080
well,
what?

1632
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,360
What can I do?
You know,

1633
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:30,840
a lot of people actually think 
murraylands done.

1634
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,010
They're just like,
oh dude,

1635
01:04:32,011 --> 01:04:32,890
congrats.
Murraylands dead,

1636
01:04:32,891 --> 01:04:33,150
right?
Like,

1637
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:35,040
no man is still happening.
It's still being sued.

1638
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:37,650
It's all happening.
It's just less current account that it's

1639
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:38,700
five years.
But that's exactly,

1640
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:40,260
they're there.
That's what they're doing.

1641
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:45,261
That's our objective.
But I think also the land fatigue and 

1642
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:45,261
people are tired of fucking hearing 
about it.

1643
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:45,261
I'm tired of trying it,
you know?

1644
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:50,350
Well it's,
I think also the 11 different counts of 

1645
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:50,350
animal abuse.
You know,

1646
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:50,550
they probably fought like,
oh,

1647
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:52,270
this is it.
No,

1648
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,530
I thought that that was it.
And then they turn around a pseudo Spca,

1649
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:58,140
which I mean,
man,

1650
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,020
it's all dark man.
It's really dark.

1651
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:03,150
And the fact that there's so many people
involved helping,

1652
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,060
it feels dark,
you know,

1653
01:05:05,061 --> 01:05:08,880
it feels,
feels like total violation of my life.

1654
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:10,560
Like whatever.
I'm,

1655
01:05:10,561 --> 01:05:11,880
I'm up for it.
I'm here to fight.

1656
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:16,881
But it feels gross.
You're at every turn being like fucked 

1657
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:22,350
and all you can do all I can do and in a
lot of times I'm not really allowed to 

1658
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:22,350
even speak of it.
I mean,

1659
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,650
I may have even compromised things in 
this.

1660
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,750
I mean,
I always compromise things when I,

1661
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,920
when I speak,
but it's,

1662
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:27,940
that's what's choice.

1663
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:31,590
How do you compromise things here today 
by telling true stories?

1664
01:05:31,591 --> 01:05:36,591
I'll find out tomorrow or Monday when I 
get a whole deluge of fucking legal 

1665
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:37,800
threats.
I,

1666
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:42,801
I've been threatened with more lawsuits.
Marine lands lawyers have in fact 

1667
01:05:42,801 --> 01:05:46,800
threatened other whistleblowers lawyers,
so they're ready to sue lawyers.

1668
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:53,940
I mean,
you want to talk about gumming up a 

1669
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:53,940
system that's over at that point.
If a lawyer who's another lawyer,

1670
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:57,631
you're looking at 15,
20 fucking years and wasn't there 

1671
01:05:57,631 --> 01:05:57,880
changes in the laws in Canada,
like how you can sue people.

1672
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:01,240
There was anti slap legislation that was
enacted years ago.

1673
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:03,880
I spoke at Queens Park is something that
you were.

1674
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,780
Yes,
of course,

1675
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:10,050
of course.
And then slap stands for strategic 

1676
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,201
lawsuit against public participation.
So I speak out against what's happening 

1677
01:06:13,201 --> 01:06:14,200
at marine land,
Greenland to multicasts rich corporation

1678
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:17,530
sues the shit out of me and strategic 
way to try to silence you.

1679
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,230
Right?
And so Ontario,

1680
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:25,260
uh,
passed a legislation to make that 

1681
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:25,260
illegal.
However,

1682
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,731
at the time Ontario's premier was suing 
the leader of the opposition.

1683
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:34,950
She took out the retro clause so it was 
no longer retroactive to any lawsuits 

1684
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:39,570
that are already in the system.
So now I'm actually fighting against a 

1685
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:42,611
lawsuit that is illegal.
And if it were to be applied to my 

1686
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:45,301
lawsuit,
had it been marina would be up against 

1687
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:47,461
some punitive damages like crazy just 
for by fault of launching a malicious 

1688
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:48,800
because it's.
But because it's not retroactive,

1689
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,980
I sit back and,
and I just continue to eat it.

1690
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:53,410
And then other people that actually I 
see it in the paper went.

1691
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:54,010
So I was like,
Oh,

1692
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:55,630
this corporation tried to sue this 
girls.

1693
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,670
They owe her half a million dollars for 
a while.

1694
01:06:57,671 --> 01:06:59,260
Maybe not have nothing,
but they all are some money for,

1695
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,460
for having lost the suit.

1696
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,810
And I'm just like,
oh dude,

1697
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:07,060
my dreams God damn man.
I feel for,

1698
01:07:07,061 --> 01:07:08,380
you know,
don't man,

1699
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,210
you know what to be fair,
it's also,

1700
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:13,210
I call it a sort of a curse and 
blessing.

1701
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:13,840
I mean,
look,

1702
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:15,340
I'm here man.
In what world would I be here?

1703
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:18,340
I was started out as a fan of the show.
I started listening to you saying things

1704
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:20,710
like,
be the hero of your fucking move yours,

1705
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,960
whatever that quote was.
And I did.

1706
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,570
And so I,
I get the idea,

1707
01:07:25,571 --> 01:07:30,571
I,
I get I each but shit starts to taste 

1708
01:07:30,571 --> 01:07:34,501
delicious.
When you see the damage you're doing as 

1709
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:34,501
well.
What are you doing for money now?

1710
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:36,850
So I started the business,
a summer business some years ago.

1711
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:41,851
I've got an Airbnb,
which is like was the best idea I've 

1712
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:43,930
ever had.
I'm so happy and blessed with this thing

1713
01:07:43,931 --> 01:07:46,120
because people come down and I host them
now.

1714
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,820
It's the thing I like to do the most.
I got a beautiful home on the water.

1715
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,880
It's leaking.
I got nice doc converted where the 

1716
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,060
apartments into an airbnb in honor of my
cat that we spoke of.

1717
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:56,300
In fact two years ago,
Eugene.

1718
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,780
So it's called the Eugene.
And so,

1719
01:07:58,781 --> 01:07:59,160
you know,
that's,

1720
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:01,580
that's a means to sort of sort of 
helping me.

1721
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,380
I go on occasionally.
I worked for a,

1722
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:09,730
for Canada post as a mailman,
which I sort of love in that.

1723
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:14,740
It challenges me everyday.
I wake up in minus 20 degrees,

1724
01:08:14,741 --> 01:08:19,741
wind powerlink blowing snow like crazy.
I got to go spend like six to eight 

1725
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:21,830
hours walking in this shit.
It sucks.

1726
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,360
But that's challenge and you gotta wake 
up and rise to it,

1727
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:26,720
right?
I mean,

1728
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:28,070
you could just as well stay in bed all 
day,

1729
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:29,000
but that's not gonna help me.

1730
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:31,370
Yeah,
that's a weird thing about mail delivery

1731
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,740
in a lot of places.
It's still walking around.

1732
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,340
Oh,
I do it.

1733
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:35,360
It's brutal.
But I love it.

1734
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:36,560
I'm walking 20 k a day,
dude.

1735
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:38,150
I lost a lot of weight.
I'm feeling good.

1736
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:39,650
It's how it helps me.
It really does.

1737
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:40,340
I,
I'm a,

1738
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,850
I need to.
I need my body moving.

1739
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,420
I know one speed fast,
know I'm 40.

1740
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:46,040
I'm slowing a little bit,
but not that much.

1741
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,320
Surprisingly.
Uh,

1742
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,510
hopefully.
Hopefully my run last for awhile,

1743
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,850
but it helps me.
The voice in my head goes from,

1744
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:56,600
dude,
everything's abysmal and fuck to do.

1745
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:57,830
You got this man.
Stick with it.

1746
01:08:57,831 --> 01:08:58,760
You got this.
You know,

1747
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:00,290
you listen to music and getting 
powerful.

1748
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:01,280
You're feeling good,
man.

1749
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:02,960
It's just right for me.
It really is.

1750
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,450
In a perfect world,
where would you look all this to end?

1751
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:06,930
I want the walters.

1752
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,090
Sounds crazy.
My dream is I'm going to free whales.

1753
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:12,740
There's going to be a sanctuary.
I'm going to free marine lends whales.

1754
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:14,600
I'm going to have a hand in this.
That's going to happen.

1755
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,400
Number two,
really think that's going to happen.

1756
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:21,401
You think they're gonna enact 
legislation that makes them release 

1757
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:22,850
those animals?
I think so,

1758
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:23,630
yes.
Really?

1759
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,700
What makes you so hopeful?
As two or three,

1760
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:28,850
they realized tried to kill this bill 
for years.

1761
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:31,040
Now they've not been able to in this 
time next week,

1762
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,100
so the sucker should go that whale 
sanctuary.

1763
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:39,160
Sanctuary project.
They're going to build a whale 

1764
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,141
sanctuary.
There's going to be a place where 

1765
01:09:41,141 --> 01:09:42,701
whales,
if it's in Canada and all the 

1766
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:42,860
exportation laws are that marine land 
can't get rid of their whales.

1767
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:47,890
There will only be one place for whales 
if that business elects to evolve or if 

1768
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:48,980
there's any type of ownership changes.

1769
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:52,250
I see this being explained to me how 
this sanctuary would work.

1770
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,640
Well,
you'd have an environment where is a pen

1771
01:09:55,641 --> 01:10:00,641
off in the ocean and I mean various 
different pens for various different 

1772
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:03,650
procedures if you will,
but the idea is that you,

1773
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:09,040
if they can't be wholly released,
then you've got to place where they have

1774
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:10,830
a sense assemblance of,
of,

1775
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:11,690
of freedom,
if you will,

1776
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,600
but it'll be an human care.
There'll be more of like,

1777
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:19,601
for instance,
a viewing platform where people will be 

1778
01:10:19,601 --> 01:10:21,701
able to view the whales versus and how 
big of an area we're talking about 

1779
01:10:21,701 --> 01:10:21,701
massive.
Yeah.

1780
01:10:21,701 --> 01:10:21,920
I don't.
I can't say the square footage.

1781
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:26,921
I don't know because that nothing's 
finalized so we're still under the 

1782
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:29,501
development.
Would they develop a bay or something 

1783
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:32,441
where they would want to ideally get a 
bay that has good water changeover that 

1784
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:32,441
you know that that works.

1785
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:36,670
If you can find that,
and I mean the east coast is looking 

1786
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:39,320
really good these days.
Is there a model that they've drawn up?

1787
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,900
Not.
Oh,

1788
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:41,540
there's models.
Yeah.

1789
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:41,990
No,
absolutely.

1790
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:43,660
There's.
When we look at something like this,

1791
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:45,460
if you haven't got the whale sanctuary 
project,

1792
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,850
I'm sure you'll find tons of different 
things.

1793
01:10:46,851 --> 01:10:49,880
I just don't know how they're keeping 
the ORC in those things.

1794
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:51,530
If you put a fence up,
they're not going to go anywhere.

1795
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,300
They wouldn't jump the fence.
They don't.

1796
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,400
There's something about jumping out.
I mean,

1797
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:58,490
when the.
When the wild captures happen,

1798
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:04,060
what do we got here?
There's the whale sanctuary point 

1799
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,600
building.
A model sanctuary were kept whales and 

1800
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,801
dolphins can reread habilitated and live
permanently in their natural 

1801
01:11:08,801 --> 01:11:09,200
environment,
so it's a step.

1802
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,500
So this is a step between this and then 
the wild.

1803
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,250
Yes.

1804
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:19,310
No.
Are they going to free them and then 

1805
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,250
release fish in there for them to eat?
I imagine there'll be all of that.

1806
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:22,040
Every which way.
That would be nice to the.

1807
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,300
Allow them to actually hunt and kill the
fish,

1808
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:25,920
which I'm sure that's what they want to 
do.

1809
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,470
The fact that they can feel the natural 
rhythms of the sea.

1810
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:30,300
I mean,
they're in tune with the senior in their

1811
01:11:30,301 --> 01:11:31,470
environment that the pools.
No,

1812
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:36,440
please look what it says here.
For medium survive,

1813
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:41,480
for years,
median survival time in years for wild 

1814
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,621
caught orcas at a marine park for years.
One thousand 100 square yards of space 

1815
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:49,800
and a large display tank.
And a typical high end marine tank.

1816
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:55,070
Three hundred 14,600
is the minimum number of square yards 

1817
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:58,800
for the first whale sanctuary project.
Seaside sanctuary.

1818
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:03,980
So this is 314,000,
600 square yards.

1819
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:05,970
So it would be a massive place.

1820
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:12,010
One hundred and five is the number of 
captive orcas and Balugas and North 

1821
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,330
America.
So that includes marine land.

1822
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:16,860
Some marine land has half the Balugas in
North America.

1823
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:18,360
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

1824
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,760
And they fly under the radar because no 
one wants to talk about them.

1825
01:12:20,761 --> 01:12:25,761
Right?
Twenty four slash seven round the clock 

1826
01:12:25,761 --> 01:12:25,761
care care for the whales at the 
sanctuary.

1827
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:31,010
That sounds beautiful.
Murraylands threatened to sue these 

1828
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:31,010
people.
These people.

1829
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,850
Somebody fucking.
I am dude,

1830
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,090
but more.
We need more than just you.

1831
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,250
It seems like.
Fuck man.

1832
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,800
People listening.
Please get involved.

1833
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:45,870
This is a great step though.
I love this idea of this step,

1834
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,690
you know,
like have something that's like a bridge

1835
01:12:48,691 --> 01:12:53,691
between the captive and the wild.
Also it would allow their atrophied 

1836
01:12:54,301 --> 01:12:58,020
dorsal fins to reinvigorate.
They could start diving deep again.

1837
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:03,050
I mean you know how deep it necessarily,
but I mean at least a little bit and 

1838
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:03,050
get.

1839
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,770
You could train these animals to 
physically take them for walks,

1840
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:09,771
if you will.
I guess you'd call him swims where you 

1841
01:13:09,771 --> 01:13:09,771
will be able to leave and have them just
follow a boat and go for some exercise.

1842
01:13:09,771 --> 01:13:10,110
You can totally do.
I mean it really.

1843
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,020
The things that this is going to 
present,

1844
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:18,021
the opportunities for these animals is 
brilliant and amazing and the board is 

1845
01:13:18,021 --> 01:13:21,051
comprised of all your,
all your wild animal brilliant 

1846
01:13:21,051 --> 01:13:21,330
scientists.
I mean this is the project.

1847
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:23,730
This is the future.
So that is the way to do it,

1848
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:28,731
right?
Because I've always said when you go to 

1849
01:13:28,731 --> 01:13:30,561
a place like sea world or whatever and 
you look at all those dolphins and 

1850
01:13:30,561 --> 01:13:32,070
killer whales,
like how would you get them free?

1851
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,590
How did,
there would have to be some intermediary

1852
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:35,790
step.
There it is.

1853
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:40,230
Wow.
That's exciting times,

1854
01:13:40,231 --> 01:13:41,940
man.
I hope they do that man.

1855
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:46,970
It's comp.
They do that because I feel like if 

1856
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:47,400
there was a place where you could go and
people could feed the killer whales like

1857
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:49,860
released some fish or something like 
that and be there to watch,

1858
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:53,940
that would be way more exciting than 
watching them in a swimming pool.

1859
01:13:53,941 --> 01:13:58,941
Watch a fucking killer whale fart in the
wild versus do a back flip in captivity 

1860
01:13:58,941 --> 01:13:59,950
and you're watching that fight.
And uh,

1861
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:04,960
and,
and this thing is just music and 

1862
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:04,960
bullshit.
I pulled over,

1863
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:04,960
uh,
yesterday morning.

1864
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,820
I was in Malibu real early in the 
morning and uh,

1865
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:10,170
I pulled over and watched some dolphins.
It was awesome.

1866
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,220
I was told I was speaking with someone.
They're like,

1867
01:14:12,221 --> 01:14:12,910
dude,
they're here.

1868
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:14,200
They're in Malibu.
Yeah,

1869
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:16,040
they're here right now.
I was um,

1870
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:19,270
I was on the pch and I was driving under
the corner of my eye,

1871
01:14:19,271 --> 01:14:24,271
saw something in the water and then I 
saw the tail going over a few of them 

1872
01:14:24,671 --> 01:14:27,490
together and I pulled over and I'm like,
fuck man,

1873
01:14:27,491 --> 01:14:28,300
that's amazing.

1874
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:29,540
Like,
I don't want to live in mal books.

1875
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:32,440
I'm scared of tsunamis.
But if you were there,

1876
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:37,860
like right there,
like looking out your fucking bedroom 

1877
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:38,380
window and checking that out first thing
in the morning.

1878
01:14:38,381 --> 01:14:40,900
I wish dolphins in your yard.
Yeah.

1879
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:43,030
And they're just wild man.
Having a good old time.

1880
01:14:43,031 --> 01:14:44,920
They just feel different,
you know,

1881
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:48,040
you see them in marine land or I've 
never seen him in marine land,

1882
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:52,840
but you see him in any sort of captive 
area and you just get this weird feeling

1883
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:53,140
like,
yeah,

1884
01:14:53,141 --> 01:14:54,640
they're cool to look at.
But man,

1885
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:56,260
they're just not.
They're just not,

1886
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:58,180
you know,
there's something missing there.

1887
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:03,280
It's like the difference between seeing 
a cow in a pen versus a buffalo in the 

1888
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:03,490
wild,
you know,

1889
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,770
just this is where hunters,
I say they're really.

1890
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:10,830
This is where I get a lot of support 
from hunters because didn't know 

1891
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:10,830
hunters.

1892
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:10,830
I mean all you got to do is grab a 
pigeon,

1893
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:11,890
just go on the corner of street,
grab a pigeon,

1894
01:15:11,891 --> 01:15:13,720
if you can grab it,
put it in a cage and watch how depressed

1895
01:15:13,721 --> 01:15:15,100
you are in a half hour watching them.
I mean,

1896
01:15:15,101 --> 01:15:17,980
this is horrible.
So that's what I love about.

1897
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,300
The hunters are just like,
no man,

1898
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,800
you got this thing right?
Like fuck it.

1899
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,260
Well,
and people have this erroneous idea that

1900
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:25,560
hunters hate animals.
Kill Them.

1901
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:28,600
They love wild animals.
They love things to be wild.

1902
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,710
You know,
it's just a,

1903
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:36,160
just a very depressing aspect of human 
nature that we've chosen to go down this

1904
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,960
route and that we did it a long time 
ago.

1905
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:42,961
I really truly believe that if there was
no dolphin and Orca captivity ever 

1906
01:15:42,961 --> 01:15:45,820
previously before,
it would not be possible to do today.

1907
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,320
Impossible.
People would freak out.

1908
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,670
They would,
at least in America,

1909
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,550
the future is brandon.

1910
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,180
Uh,
kids are repulsed by it already.

1911
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,690
I mean,
this is where they should be.

1912
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:56,590
I go speak to schools and every kid in 
the beautiful thing,

1913
01:15:56,591 --> 01:16:01,591
and I mean it sounds horrible,
but the kids that go to marina and get 

1914
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:01,591
singled out pretty bad by the other 
kids,

1915
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:02,640
so it's not a good time to bring your 
kids to,

1916
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:07,810
to,
to a place like marina and lets your 

1917
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:07,810
kids have your kids picked up.
What about China?

1918
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:08,920
How is it?
How's it so cool in China?

1919
01:16:08,921 --> 01:16:11,020
They just don't get it over there.
They just don't know.

1920
01:16:11,021 --> 01:16:12,220
Fairly firm culture.
Yeah,

1921
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:13,930
it's fairly new for sure.
Cultural.

1922
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:14,320
Yeah.
I mean,

1923
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:15,250
I don't want.
I don't know.

1924
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:19,210
I just know that that's,
that will be there for awhile yet.

1925
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:24,890
Right?
The paradigm shift hasn't taken their 

1926
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:24,890
man.
That'll be a while.

1927
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:27,280
Yeah.
So save smooshy.com

1928
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:31,120
for anybody who wants to go and um,
and they can.

1929
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:36,150
That's where your gofund me is,
that's where they can watch the 

1930
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:37,740
documentary.
And I'm listening,

1931
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,400
man.
I hope in some way this helps.

1932
01:16:39,401 --> 01:16:41,560
You always does.
I'm super appreciative.

1933
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:46,630
I hope in some way it gets people to 
donate and to pay attention and to be 

1934
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:48,670
aware.
And please folks watched blackfish.

1935
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:53,410
Just go watch that and if,
if it doesn't make you crack up,

1936
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:58,500
if it doesn't make you cry,
it doesn't make you really sad that 

1937
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,290
people are capable of doing that.
It's just,

1938
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:00,910
um,
it's just wrong.

1939
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:01,900
It's just,
it's not,

1940
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,810
it's not what we should be doing as a,
as a,

1941
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,730
as a species,
as a race,

1942
01:17:06,731 --> 01:17:11,731
as a civilization.
It's just the wrong thing to do and one 

1943
01:17:11,731 --> 01:17:15,050
day it will be looked upon very,
very poorly.

1944
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,660
The timing of people putting their eyes 
on me now,

1945
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,550
it's never been better.
Things are gonna happen.

1946
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:24,580
Follow me on twitter.
I'm going to be tweeting a lot of major 

1947
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:24,580
developments in the coming month.
The timing of this,

1948
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:26,720
of this particular podcast couldn't have
been better.

1949
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:29,060
And again,
I'm super indemnity forever.

1950
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,710
I'm still appreciative.
I'm appreciative.

1951
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:31,460
You too,
my brother.

1952
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:32,300
Thanks man.
Thank you.

1953
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,280
All right folks.
We'll be back next week.

1954
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,570
Enjoy your life by.
