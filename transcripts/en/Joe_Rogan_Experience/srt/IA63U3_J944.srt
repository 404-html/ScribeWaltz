1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,981
Doom,
doom.

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:02,380
Doom.

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,950
MMM.
Doda

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,600
amber live my man.
I wish people who weren't watching on

5
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:16,280
Youtube could just see the majesty.
That is the jacket that robin black is

6
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:18,410
wearing right now.
How would you describe that?

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,480
ADDS just a Jean Jacket,
man.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,660
It's a colorful jean jacket.
I like colorful stuff is definitely

9
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:24,980
code,
but it's not just colorful.

10
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:27,800
It's like you're trying to blend in an
array like could be,

11
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:32,330
it does have some camouflaging affects
you if you were a hunting in a rave,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,520
that's what you and where exactly.
It's like,

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,970
I don't know what you'd behind Posi
yeah,

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,550
ecstasy.
It's like a light blue with like purple.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,110
Yeah.
Some sort of decorations.

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,960
Camouflage is a weird thing.
And like what you see guys walking down

17
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:50,360
the street with camouflage and it's
like,

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,670
it's what if they really were
camouflaged?

19
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:55,730
Like he'd just see a head floating down
the street and one day they're going to

20
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:56,150
have that.

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,220
Have you ever seen that Japanese
invention that came up with,

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,340
they have this,
um,

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,170
like a cloak that you can wear and it
essentially takes an image of what's

24
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:06,380
behind you and projected on the front.
So,

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:07,781
visibility.
Yeah,

26
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:08,390
it was,
it's,

27
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,010
you know,
it's kind of crude right now,

28
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:13,250
but what it is is like the guy standing
like you could see it right here.

29
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,290
Look at this.
That is ridiculous.

30
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,640
And then nuts.
That is wild.

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,690
So this guys,
so we're,

32
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:21,350
we're looking at is a guy holding a ball
and the ball does it.

33
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,460
And so the ball somehow or another,
he's holding it in front of his face and

34
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:29,510
it doesn't show him when it's in front
of them and shows what's behind him.

35
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,500
I don't know how that one's working.
I don't know.

36
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,700
So here's the,
this is the cloak.

37
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:37,010
I've seen the cloak before,
but you know,

38
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:38,510
you can still see the cloak.

39
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,770
Well,
that's the thing with that kind of

40
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:41,300
technology,
once it starts,

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,140
then you're on your way.
Whether it's in one year or three years

42
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:47,480
or 12 years,
you're going to be invisible.

43
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,590
Yeah.
It's,

44
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,770
we're in such a strange time because
these emerging things are just starting

45
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:53,120
to come out where,
where people go,

46
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,620
Ooh,
oh,

47
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,970
whoa.
You know,

48
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:58,490
like magic leap.
If you've seen that magic leap

49
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:01,100
technology,
I just retweeted a new version of it

50
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:02,410
today that somebody sent me.
It's like,

51
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,510
Oh God damn it.
It just keeps getting so bad.

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,340
It wasn't magic leap or was it the,
um,

53
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,540
the Microsoft one,
which one's a man?

54
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,400
One's a google one and one's a Microsoft
Microsoft one.

55
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,850
Which one that I tweet to them looking
right now,

56
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,383
but they've,
um,

57
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,730
Hololens,
Hololens,

58
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,410
Microsoft,
that's Microsoft to is they've got these

59
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:23,810
new goggles that you're going to be able
to wear and it's going to be like

60
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,740
minority report.

61
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,570
Like the world is going to be your
desktop.

62
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,330
It will spin things in the air,
stop them,

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,100
expand them,
contract.

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I,
you knew that was coming like as soon as

65
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:36,440
you see it on a movie,
you know that's going to happen to one

66
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,560
thing.
Right now it's like we are in probably

67
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:42,290
the fastest time of change ever.
You know what I mean?

68
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:46,220
It's like if you have an idea,
that idea can be done.

69
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,260
It's just a series of steps to have to
do it.

70
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,310
Yeah.
I mean,

71
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,280
I think if you go back just a few,
there's this it right here,

72
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:53,480
Jamie.
Just the picture.

73
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,840
Just pictures of them using it.
Like how crazy it's going to be a man.

74
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:59,590
You're going to be able to like see
movies play out in your living room

75
00:02:59,591 --> 00:02:59,980
right in front

76
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,120
of you.
Video Games.

77
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,201
Uh,
you know,

78
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,300
if you were doing a demonstration for
like a company or something like that

79
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,660
and you want to show them a project
you're working on or maybe some

80
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,770
architecture you're trying to do.

81
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,220
Construct.
Yeah.

82
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,870
Fucking crazy time.
The first thing people are gonna start

83
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:15,000
doing this.
How do we connect this to sex?

84
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,020
Oh yeah.
Right away.

85
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,120
That's where the money is.
That's what the,

86
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:20,430
somebody is thinking of that right now.
People are going to be able to fuck

87
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:21,880
right in your living room.
Right.

88
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,020
You're going to be a little,
that's what the new porn is going to be.

89
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,590
The thing is,
I can fuck in my living room.

90
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,453
Yes.
All right.

91
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,040
Do it yourself.
I could do it yourself world.

92
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,130
We need to get back to that.
People get back to doing things.

93
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,830
Actually not just watching them.
Yeah,

94
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,940
I that is,
that is all weird thing.

95
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:37,950
I mean,
as much as you know,

96
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,910
you make comedy and fighting and
podcasts and stuff,

97
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,540
it's still strange that people watch
stuff all the time.

98
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,700
Telling you find would love to be
entertained.

99
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,670
Yeah.
You know,

100
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,920
we like,
we like to just have other people do the

101
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,110
shit that sit back and watch.
Yeah.

102
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,390
But you would find that this is
something I always kind of wonder about

103
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:03,570
you,
how you can possibly consume so many

104
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:08,571
interesting and unrelated topics and
develop expertise in so many unrelated

105
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:13,620
things while being a content maker.
Like you're making stuff that people

106
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,560
consume.
How can you possibly be mastering all

107
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:17,394
these things at once?

108
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,860
I don't really have any.
I'm not,

109
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:21,410
I've mastered anything.
You know,

110
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,240
I'm,
I'm pretty good at comedy.

111
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,610
I throw some good kicks.
I know Jujitsu pretty well.

112
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,130
I'm not a master at any of those things.

113
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,980
Yeah.
But I mean your ball hunting,

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,970
you're,
you know,

115
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,460
there's so many different things.
You know,

116
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:38,461
like I literally do fighting stuff all
day every day and when I get a break I

117
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,610
hang out with my wife and sometimes I'll
take a day off and that's it.

118
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:43,860
I don't know about other stuff.
It,

119
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,850
it fascinates me how you can possibly
know about so many things that seem

120
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:49,570
unconnected.

121
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,990
I assume that it's probably some
something wrong with my brain,

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,270
you know,
I assumed that this,

123
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,950
it's like an extreme form of add,
but I need a bunch of different things

124
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,320
going on in my mind,
in my life.

125
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:04,060
I just,
if I don't have a bunch of different

126
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:04,960
things going on,
I don't,

127
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,270
I don't feel stimulated enough.

128
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,300
I,
I'm almost the opposite.

129
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:14,301
It's like I literally specialized so
deeply in something once I know

130
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:16,800
something about it,
I need to know way more about it.

131
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,790
And when I know stuff about that,
that opens up a ton of new questions and

132
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:25,791
that's why it's the same kind of area of
stuff that I am obsessive Lee

133
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:28,140
researching and studying.
I do that too,

134
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:29,760
but I just do it with a bunch of
different things.

135
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,830
That's what I mean.
That's what I'm getting at.

136
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,260
I listened to a archery podcasts where
they're just talking about very specific

137
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,360
ways to hold a bow and and,
and fix your site and make sure you use

138
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:43,490
it at least properly.
I'll listen those fucking things for

139
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:47,420
hours and hours and hours,
obsessive Lee and top of practicing.

140
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,600
I just get obsessed with things but I
used to worry about it when I was

141
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,381
younger.
I used to be like,

142
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:54,200
what the fuck is wrong with me?
I can't just concentrate on one thing.

143
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:56,330
I always have all these other shit going
on in my life.

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
But then realized like,
well that's just

145
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,100
me.
If I just enjoy it and just do those

146
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:05,690
things then then it doesn't concern me
then I'm just appreciative that I have

147
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,120
so many interests.
Did you ever read?

148
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,550
Uh,
at some piece somebody wrote something

149
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:11,384
about,
uh,

150
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,980
oh,
I hate Joe Rogan,

151
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:16,490
or why I hate Joe Rogan.
And then he went on this path and he

152
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:21,290
discovered that he actually hated that
you wear your authentic self.

153
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,750
Have you ever read this?
Somebody wrote this thing and he,

154
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,500
as he learned more about what it was to
be authentically him,

155
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,120
he realized his hatred for some famous
person was that he was looking at him

156
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,340
and he hated that that guy was actually
him.

157
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,540
Obviously it's easy to hate somebody
that's like in the microscope all the

158
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,730
time because you'll find all these
flaws,

159
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:43,000
like if you follow someone every day,
day in,

160
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,010
day out and expect perfection or
enlightenment,

161
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,500
you're going to be massively
disappointed because the kind of

162
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,930
exposure that you get when you're doing
a podcast,

163
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,600
like when you're talking to someone for
hours and hours and hours.

164
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,090
You know,
I've done 700 and what is it,

165
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:59,990
seven,
so 760 to 762 podcasts.

166
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,990
The shortest one is an hour.
Most of them are three hours.

167
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,050
It's 2,100 almost 2,500 hours,
somewhere around that,

168
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,090
you know,
give or take.

169
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,280
That's what it's.
Um,

170
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,230
there's know so you're going to,
you're going to get annoyed at me.

171
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,210
I get annoyed at me.
Hey,

172
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,820
but his point wasn't that it was that
you are authentically Joe Rogan,

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,670
like whatever it is you do,
you ended up being,

174
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:26,030
I mean you're sitting here in a place
that you built to do the thing that you

175
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,250
want to do.
Exactly the way you want to do it.

176
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:31,040
You're as authentically a human being as
a person can be.

177
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,100
Or just so you know what you're talking
about,

178
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:37,130
accepting why you go and do things the
way that you do them.

179
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,220
That's why you do cause you're like fuck
being some other thing.

180
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm going to be this thing.
Well that's just,

181
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,170
I think having this kind of a life is
super lucky and if I didn't live it that

182
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:49,880
way,
I wouldn't be taken advantage of this

183
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,980
huge opportunity that very few people
get.

184
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,970
Most people have to work.
Do they have an actual fucking job that

185
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,950
they don't really necessarily like that
much?

186
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,380
And somehow or another I've figured out
a way.

187
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:03,410
I mean I worked when I was younger for
sure and I figured out how to get to

188
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:07,850
this spot by sort of moving away from
things that I didn't want to do.

189
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,340
But now that I get to a point where
everything I do,

190
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:11,810
whether it's his,
but I was looking forward to this,

191
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,501
I'm like,
I'm going to get the,

192
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,930
hang on my friend rob.
You can have some fun talk,

193
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:18,080
some MMA and life and all kinds of shit
and that's the same thing.

194
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,450
I feel like what I go do stand up.
Same thing.

195
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:23,290
I feel like when I'm practicing archery
or I'm working out this,

196
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,950
those,
these are things I enjoy doing.

197
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,980
So that's why I do what I do and I
really believe people can do that.

198
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,720
I think it just have to start first of
all,

199
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,490
by figuring out what it is you want to
do.

200
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,680
Because if you don't know that,
then you're just going to start

201
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,060
wandering.
But the thing is to be pushed.

202
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,920
Somebody,
they all know.

203
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,590
Most people really know what it is that
they love.

204
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,520
I find the young people lot of times
don't like a lot of young young folks

205
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:50,090
when to talk to them.
They just don't have a path like,

206
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:51,800
God,
I just need to find something to do.

207
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:53,760
I'm thinking about doing this,
or maybe I'll,

208
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:56,130
I'll join the military to get some
guidance and some

209
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,680
discipline or maybe I'll do that.
Or they just,

210
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,960
it's,
it's hard to tell because like,

211
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,580
what's cool for you,
you know,

212
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:04,740
Jamie might not like with Jenny might
like,

213
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:05,440
I might not,
yeah.

214
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,780
Jamie was trying to find a Kanye west
shoes.

215
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,500
I'll ask her.
This jacket is mother.

216
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:13,000
Motherfucker was up all night trying to
get Kanye West.

217
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,920
You know,
it's true for everybody.

218
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:19,090
Everybody's different.
You know?

219
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,680
I think you got to figure out what it is
you like doing because the path of going

220
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:27,850
to do that is the whole point is that
people often be like,

221
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,790
well,
I want to get this kind of job or I want

222
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,010
to buy this kind of house and it's not,
it's not supposed to be that way,

223
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:35,680
in my opinion.
You're supposed to start on a path and

224
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,990
on that path,
traveling along it,

225
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,810
you're having adventures,
you're stumbling onto new things,

226
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,520
and the challenge of it being really
hard to achieve is part of what gets you

227
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:46,550
up every day.
Yeah,

228
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,170
and it's also fun.
Yeah.

229
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,940
Watching things,
improve,

230
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:53,240
watching yourself get better at things
and analyzing things and figuring out

231
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,710
what the whole,
the holes are,

232
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:58,070
the flaws where the,
where the errors are and your little

233
00:09:58,071 --> 00:09:59,840
system that you've created.
Those,

234
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,760
those,
those moments are fucking awesome.

235
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:02,650
They're really fun.
Yeah.

236
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,760
It's just,
you don't want really frustrates me,

237
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,770
really frustrates me when talking about
these things.

238
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:09,500
Sometimes I'll get messages from people
and they'll say,

239
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:11,160
well,
that's easy for you to,

240
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,300
because you know you've got lucky and
you found it,

241
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:15,600
but like,
you know,

242
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,020
a lot of people can't do that.
A lot of people have responded in,

243
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:19,850
they'll,
they'll come up with all these reasons

244
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:22,850
why they can't.
Instead of saying,

245
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,850
well,
my situation is particularly difficult,

246
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,310
but there's a work around and I'm going
to find it.

247
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,810
Yeah.
It might take me a year.

248
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,520
It might take me a decade.
I'm going to find it.

249
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,110
If

250
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,780
wherever it is you're ending up is
somewhere in the future,

251
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:36,610
you don't know what that is and now it's
like,

252
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,500
well,
I would like to do that thing I got to

253
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,360
do,
but I have all these responsibilities.

254
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,580
Okay.
Our new job to figure out how to take

255
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:44,260
care of those responsibilities.
That's step one.

256
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,140
Do you know what that maslow's hierarchy
of needs?

257
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,220
Yes.
Yeah.

258
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,900
That idea that first we have to like
eat.

259
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,370
You gotta eat,
you gotta stay dry and you got to drink

260
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:58,210
water and once we've kind of
accomplished that kind of stuff that's

261
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,280
out of the way,
then we start to go a little further.

262
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:03,160
How do we become safer?
Once that happens,

263
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,850
you climb up to the point that you're
actually eating,

264
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,170
sleeping,
having sex.

265
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,940
You have a place to live,
you have a job,

266
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,570
and now you're trying to learn more
things and it's just a natural kind of

267
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,670
transition to get smarter and move.

268
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,950
But it's easy to say that.
The hard part I think is starting going

269
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,720
now.
Yeah.

270
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,000
You know the hard part is going,
okay,

271
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:25,210
this isn't working well.
What if I got some exercise like maybe

272
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:28,990
that would help like something.
For some people that path isn't what job

273
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:30,730
do I got to start tomorrow?
That path is like,

274
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,040
well,
I'm unhealthy are I don't think,

275
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,590
my thought processes aren't things that
lead me this way,

276
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,070
so you've got to start way low on that
thing and start getting that shit

277
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:40,270
together.
Eat good,

278
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,060
get sleep and exercise.
That shit.

279
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,800
Everybody should have to do those things
like in our society should be shaped in

280
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:51,730
a way that you have to do those things
because if you aren't doing those things

281
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,270
right there,
you're starting from a place where we're

282
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:56,470
just not performing as well as you
could.

283
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,270
It's so hard to tell people that though.

284
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,790
They don't want to hear it.
They just love that food porn.

285
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,520
He just love just shoving doughnuts in
their face.

286
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,990
Yeah,
pasta and just fucking sugar

287
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,570
shame,
but there's a lot of things that are

288
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:15,820
terrible for you that are great
heroines.

289
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,870
I've only been in woodland hills three
times.

290
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,580
This is the second time we've been on
your shelf.

291
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,550
The other time was the time I was on
heroin for four days.

292
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,440
That's the only other time I was in four
days or four days in woodland hills.

293
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,330
I was 20 years old to him.
Yeah.

294
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:33,080
It was weird shooting up.
Yeah.

295
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,330
Yeah.
It was very strange.

296
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:35,500
Telecom.
That's a commitment.

297
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,480
Yeah.
It didn't start that way.

298
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,790
Like lit,
like all things Mo,

299
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,150
nobody grows up and says,
I'm going to do really stupid things.

300
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,150
I was like 20 and I lived in Winnipeg,
Manitoba,

301
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,230
and uh,
I was really into music and I came down

302
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:52,330
here for,
I was a hairdresser at the time.

303
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,410
And so,
uh,

304
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,740
uh,
and this jacket would work perfectly.

305
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,870
So your hair.
Yeah,

306
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,330
exactly.
So,

307
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:01,500
and I was down here doing some,
like I would go do platform work where I

308
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:04,720
would like demonstrate how to do stuff
for other hairdressers and people.

309
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,550
And uh,
I went to,

310
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,710
uh,
uh,

311
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,210
not the viper room,
uh,

312
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,330
one of those clubs.
And this pretty woman comes up to me and

313
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,390
says,
uh,

314
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,210
are you a musician?
And I'm like,

315
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,930
yeah,
but,

316
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,300
and I'm kind of about to say,
but I live in Canada.

317
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:20,530
And that you know,
and she goes,

318
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:22,960
well,
my husband's putting together a band and

319
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:23,830
a,
you got to meet him.

320
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,480
His name's Andy Mccoy and Eddie Mccoy
wouldn't mean much to a lot of people,

321
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:32,080
but to somebody who was really into like
motley crue and stuff like that,

322
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,310
he was in a band called Hanoi rocks that
was kind of started that movement.

323
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,300
I'm like,
Whoa Shit,

324
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:40,330
I'm going to be famous.
Like I'm going to be rich and famous.

325
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,140
Not knowing that,
although metal edge told me that this

326
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,840
guy was a big deal,
he was just to get a musician,

327
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,250
but I had to a 20 year old from
Winnipeg,

328
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,650
so call my God,
I'm going to be in a huge fucking band.

329
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,540
So I go and I meet him,
we go to his house in Woodland Hills and

330
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,680
I actually,
I've been here four times.

331
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:59,250
There was that time that I flew home to
Winnipeg and they flew me back down

332
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,030
because they were going to get me
singing in their band.

333
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,250
I'm like 20 years old.
This guy is like famous to me,

334
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:05,860
right?
So I get down there and that shit is

335
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:08,080
done.
All that organized,

336
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,270
you know what I mean?
Like something's not making a lot of

337
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:12,370
sense.
And then around day two I figured out,

338
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:14,560
okay,
because everyone's on heroin.

339
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,380
And it started,
we had smoked some pot,

340
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,810
which in Winnipeg,
in Manitoba we called that dope,

341
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:21,040
you want to smoke some dope?
It's like,

342
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,060
sure.
It was like,

343
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,320
so he goes,
do you do dope?

344
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:23,681
I'm like,
yeah,

345
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:26,110
I just smoked it with you like 20
minutes ago because no like,

346
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,080
and then before I knew it,
he injected me with heroin.

347
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,120
Like a sorta happened.
I was trying to be a,

348
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,520
not super uncool,
but like not saying yes,

349
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:39,700
I want to do heroin.
And then four days went by like

350
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:44,701
literally just shooting up for days.
And then I just about miss my plane

351
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,640
home.
So I had a girl and a and a home and a

352
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:52,730
job and all those kinds of things.
And I'm kind of at like the plane ticket

353
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,500
and I know it's like,
okay,

354
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,470
if I get a cab in the next two hours,
I'll get the plane,

355
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,610
I'll get home and whatever.

356
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,511
And he's like,
well,

357
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:00,131
just,
you know,

358
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:03,260
and you're not even thinking.
It's like you're barely even there.

359
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,090
And somewhere along the line I was just
like,

360
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,280
don't worry about it.
Just fine.

361
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,320
You don't have to go get on the plane.
I probably got $100 to my name and if I

362
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,610
didn't get on that play and I'd have no
job,

363
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,940
no girl,
I'd be a heroin addict with no money in

364
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:19,850
woodland hills with a guy who's doesn't
have his shit together.

365
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,310
I think in the years since he's got his
shit together,

366
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,760
I haven't seen him since then.
And uh,

367
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,420
I've made myself go and I was sick for
two or three days and I realized like

368
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,450
literally that second in time,
if I don't convince myself to get on

369
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,860
that plane,
my whole life is fucking ruined.

370
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,080
Whoa.
Yeah.

371
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,900
Like I just so vividly remember talking,
my,

372
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,570
trying to talk myself into just fuck it,
stay here.

373
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,640
Don't worry about it.
And then I would think to myself,

374
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,720
well,
what are you going to do?

375
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:49,790
When are you going to get home?
Don't fucking worry about a man.

376
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,680
And I just forced my,
and I would literally convincing myself,

377
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,970
don't bother,
don't worry.

378
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,610
It's not a big deal.
But it was obviously a big deal.

379
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,310
And I got home,
I was sick for two days and I've never

380
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:04,220
taken an opiate or any kind of pain
killer ever again.

381
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,960
So you were sick,
like hung over violent form of it

382
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:14,090
withdrawals.
Probably like you'd have to talk to,

383
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,150
you know,
I,

384
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,620
in the course of playing in music,
I've met lots of people who have opiate

385
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,570
problems and they would say,
aw man,

386
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:21,650
four days,
that's nothing.

387
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:23,870
But to a person who,
you know,

388
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:28,220
to a person who was a normal person and
then we'll all of a sudden they were

389
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,540
doing drugs for four days.

390
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,680
It probably was.
Yeah,

391
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,260
violent withdrawal.
So it was very sick and I knew that day

392
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:36,650
it's like I'm just never going to take
any kind of narcotic or painkiller like

393
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:38,030
that ever again.
Wow.

394
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,150
So that was second,
last time I was in woodland hills.

395
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,080
Well,
the,

396
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,120
I deal that you could just become that
person like that.

397
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,290
You just the wrong person.
You want to do some dope,

398
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,570
Yo,
we just did dope dying.

399
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,960
All of a sudden you're on heroin.
Yeah.

400
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,260
And there's lots of those little moments
in everybody's life,

401
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,660
you know,
and you don't,

402
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,990
yeah,
that's a big one.

403
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,170
But you don't know where they are or
where they are or how they start the,

404
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:09,620
you're just suddenly,
you know what I mean?

405
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,340
Manny lasts as we get all there,
we start to get a little smarter.

406
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:18,341
You recognize big risks earlier on down
the road as you get all of their life

407
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,540
experience helps you with that shit.

408
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,250
But yeah,
that's,

409
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,660
I was thinking that on the way here
today.

410
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:24,560
I was like,
Oh yeah.

411
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,210
But I mean,
that's 25,

412
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,420
26 years ago.
So did you ever talk to that guy again?

413
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,760
Uh,
we were in touch about maybe still

414
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,220
putting this band together and then he
was clearly,

415
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,170
you know,
had addiction issues.

416
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,720
I followed him a little bit after he,
um,

417
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,310
he,
uh,

418
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,400
had a reality show.
He's from Finland and he's a pretty big

419
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:46,460
rockstar in Finland.
And he and his wife who was there at the

420
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:47,540
time,
that was a woman that I met,

421
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,800
they had a reality show with,
you know,

422
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:50,010
kind

423
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,843
of like,
um,

424
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,540
what ozzy did but with them and uh,
yeah.

425
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,070
So crazy.
Yeah.

426
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:56,904
Finland.
Yeah.

427
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,170
How many people are in Finland?
Probably about half as many as Canada.

428
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:03,150
That would be my guest.
Which about 30 million.

429
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,240
Some 15 or 20 million maybe.
And this big rock star?

430
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,380
We think so.
I mean,

431
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,214
I,
it's,

432
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,340
the whole music world is such a
different life to me now.

433
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,820
Like I've been so deeply embedded in a
fighting for the last decade.

434
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,250
Like I don't know about much alice.
Like he,

435
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,860
he could be the precedent of Finland to
right now for all I know,

436
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,910
like I just don't consume a lot of other
things.

437
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,450
It's shocking to me.
I have a lot of friends now that are

438
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:28,050
musicians that are doing really well and
not making much money.

439
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,730
Yeah,
it's fucking,

440
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,990
it's eerie.
It's eerie when you find out that these

441
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:37,320
guys who you think would be ballers or
like kind of struggling,

442
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,830
you had that,
that business is crazy dad.

443
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,860
But the touring is what I don't
understand.

444
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,530
It's like how come they're not making
all this money from touring?

445
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:50,920
But I guess it's like a comic has a much
lower overhead comics.

446
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,220
Just we don't need anything.
Just turn the microphone on and we're

447
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,810
good.
We need support.

448
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:56,460
They have all these other people that
are there.

449
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,740
You know,
they have people that carry their stuff.

450
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,780
Roadies sound people live lights.
Yeah.

451
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,140
They have other people in the band
obviously.

452
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,310
So,
um,

453
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,730
when,
when we went and saw you at cod that

454
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,940
that was awesome.
Through by the way.

455
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,130
Well that was fun.
Called Theater of the gym.

456
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,760
Doing that again next month.
Yeah.

457
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,330
Yeah.
Uh,

458
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,830
so at something like that.
Do you have anybody else like us?

459
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,250
Our sound guy?
Is it the house guy?

460
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:23,220
Like do you have a house car?
They just have to turn the mic off.

461
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,450
That's amazing.
Well,

462
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:26,630
it's just so low maintenance being a
comedian,

463
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,140
you just have to,
you know,

464
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,940
sell tickets.
And you get there and you say hi and you

465
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:35,941
can just go do your act except for the
30 years developing,

466
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,980
you're building it and having,
you know,

467
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,660
the insight to understanding how people
laugh and all that kind of stuff.

468
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,180
Yeah.
We,

469
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,570
you of developing your ability to make
an act,

470
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:49,800
but the act itself is like,
he lives for about two years dies.

471
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,140
Then you have to like let it go.
Like you,

472
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:53,460
you,
you build it up,

473
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,540
you put it on something,
put it on some sort of a special or a cd

474
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,360
or something like that.
And then you got to abandon it and wow.

475
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,520
And then you move on to the next two
hours.

476
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:05,760
And in those two years,
I'm going to pull this back to fighting

477
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,410
because everything gets pulled back.

478
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,860
I've been trying to just scope,
you don't have to talk about fighting

479
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:13,380
all the time.
I've been telling myself that outside of

480
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:17,130
work regularly,
actively trying to find other things to,

481
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,680
to know about or learn about.
But uh,

482
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,360
uh,
you build like structures around

483
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,050
something,
right?

484
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,810
So Johnny Hendricks,
he goes to fight Stephen Thompson,

485
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,890
his whole world has been built like that
act for years.

486
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,980
He's built that thing and structures
were built around how to perform that

487
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,030
act that way.
And then all of a sudden it's just

488
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,830
dated.
It's just not going to work in this

489
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,960
setting,
you know?

490
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,980
Yeah.
It's a two completely dated when you're

491
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:46,620
dealing with this,
there's two things at wonderboy didn't

492
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,020
that fight,
um,

493
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,730
that you're,
you just didn't see up until he came

494
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:55,570
around and uh,
one big one was the front leg attacks,

495
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,440
his front leg side kick in front leg
roundhouse kick to the face and you see

496
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,110
he hit johnny with the front leg side
kick to the body.

497
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,650
You can see it really shook johnny.
And then immediately afterwards he goes

498
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:08,380
high and hits him with the front leg
roundhouse kick right in the chin.

499
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,970
And he's like,
what in the fuck?

500
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,200
Like this guy can do some shit with his
feet that I'm just not geared up for.

501
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,300
I'm not,
it isn't that he didn't have the timing

502
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:21,301
for,
it's Johnny was in a gym boxing with

503
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:25,180
boxers.
Lots and lots of boxes because his hands

504
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,980
are great.
He's got to get some moving around.

505
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:31,270
As long as guys stand in front of them.
And it's like that literally what

506
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:35,860
Stephen Thompson dead and what your step
really exciting thing is seeing right

507
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:40,861
now is this weird moment where it's like
you're a great wrestler.

508
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,120
So what am I need to,
I've got to go Linda Russell.

509
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,590
You don't have to fucking learn to
wrestle.

510
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,940
We're going to do that anyways.

511
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,860
We got to learn to make it not about
wrestling.

512
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,690
We've got to make it so,
I mean mma developed by finding the

513
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,960
answer to the thing and somewhere all of
us,

514
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,670
every coach,
every one of us,

515
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,740
uh,
five years ago,

516
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:00,970
seven years ago,
we were like,

517
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,560
well that's it.
It's boxing,

518
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:04,180
wrestling,
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,

519
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,850
this cage work.
This is how fighting is done.

520
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,610
That's it.
And we're fucking way wrong.

521
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,150
So when that,
when we think that we start building a

522
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:18,100
structured gym environment curriculums,
how we train and that thing gets more

523
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:20,980
ingrained and complicated and you go to
the gym,

524
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:24,280
you work these four or five things and
some guy over here is working on other

525
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:26,920
stuff and a whole gym is like that.
And the,

526
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:30,010
all our training partners are like that
and we're working the mixed martial arts

527
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:32,080
curriculum,
but some other guy isn't.

528
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,230
And when he develops that thing,
we're not prepared for it.

529
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,900
We're just not prepared for sport
karate.

530
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,130
That's poor karate blitz.
That's something that Thompson can do.

531
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:45,250
But also he came from a kickboxing
background.

532
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:49,810
So he's got the sport karate ability to
leap in sorta like Raymond Daniels or

533
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:52,900
fights and glory.
He's got that leap in attack ability.

534
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:55,480
That's very difficult to deal with if
you don't have that kind of footwork.

535
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,780
And then on top of that,
he can string together beautiful hand

536
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,250
combinations.
So he'll,

537
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,750
he'll slide in,
blitz you with four or five beautiful

538
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:09,210
hand combinations and then slide away
and then kick you in the stomach as he

539
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:10,450
sliding away.
And you're like,

540
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,540
Jesus Christ,
you can see the bewildered look on

541
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,280
Johnny's face in that fight.
Yeah.

542
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:17,650
And he's a brilliant fighter.
He was the champ.

543
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,980
He was a tough guy.
But Johnny's got that style where he'll

544
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:22,670
stay like johnny and Robbie,
he goes,

545
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:26,290
stood in front of each other and you're
just not going to find that with

546
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:26,770
wonderboy.

547
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,120
No,
he's just not there.

548
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,930
And that's what this guy's trying to
you.

549
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,710
That's the game.
He's going to try this guy,

550
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,230
he's holding up a plastic cell.
Is it plastic sell plastics?

551
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,930
Like they sent us a conor mcgregor doll.
It's a look that is all stumpy and like

552
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,600
angry.
The same guys who sent the Biggie doll

553
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,130
that sent us a conor mcgregor and James
got a Tupac over there.

554
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,570
There's a Bruce Lee for Joey Diaz.
But uh,

555
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,890
but yeah,
but,

556
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:55,580
but,
but what he can do with his feet is not

557
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:58,130
nearly at the level that Stephen
Thompson is.

558
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,260
Stephen Thompson's doing some shit with
his feet,

559
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:02,570
the way he's throwing kicks,
they're deadly.

560
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,160
I mean he,
he's,

561
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,150
he's one of the best kick boxers that
Americans really ever produced.

562
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:11,770
That's amazing.
57 and o as a kickboxer and that,

563
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,960
and so then you go and train with
Weidman,

564
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:15,230
right?

565
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,580
And,
and,

566
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,130
and Weidman roughs you up and Rodman's
Weidman's work ethic and,

567
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,670
and the whole thing rubs off on you and
you just start getting familiar with it.

568
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:23,510
And it is,
yeah,

569
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,310
I can defend take downs,
but more importantly,

570
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,400
we ain't fucking wrestling.
We're not going to wrestle.

571
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,670
And it seems him,
Cruz,

572
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,620
Cruz,
if fucking absolute genius.

573
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,290
All these guys,
even Demetrius and,

574
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,710
and Matt Hume,
they play this game.

575
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:39,870
So we're sitting here and like,
can we,

576
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,990
we can't wrestle from here.
Right?

577
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,310
So for you to get to me,
you have to travel through space as you

578
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:47,450
move forward.
Two feet.

579
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,160
I moved back to feet.
You moved that way,

580
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:53,240
two feet and he played this game where
we keep the space forever and I just

581
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,390
keep that space as long as you want me,
I'm making that space.

582
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,840
And when the space is there,
either you're going to get so lulled

583
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:01,320
into it that I can,
uh,

584
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,830
Dardin and wonderboy as weapons,
ours kicks.

585
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,460
But some guys will do with their hands
at Darden and hit you or you start

586
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,890
chasing me.
You Chase van intercept two and fuck you

587
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,740
up.
And it's just so logical and you're

588
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:17,660
looking at it now and just the way that
the karate guys had to go learn to

589
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:21,650
wrestle or did they,
they had to learn to not wrestle to make

590
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:23,360
it not about wrestling as much as
possible.

591
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,630
The Johnny Hendricks,
the Matt Hughes style of fighter,

592
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,180
they got to figure this out.
You have to figure it out.

593
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,910
Well you know,
what happened was he learned how to get

594
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:35,750
comfortable standing up where he didn't
worry about being taken down all the

595
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:37,220
time.
And then you get to see what he's really

596
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:40,130
capable of with his striking,
cause you look at his earlier fights,

597
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,100
he was a little more tight because he
was worried about being taken down.

598
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,680
So all that takedown defense,
I mean he always had the great footwork,

599
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,840
but now he also has a solution.
If you do grab him.

600
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,180
So when guys grab him,
he's not out of water,

601
00:25:53,181 --> 00:25:56,570
he knows what to do,
he can break free again and it is way

602
00:25:56,571 --> 00:26:00,200
harder to take someone down when they're
not trying to rustle with you.

603
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,840
If someone's trying to be aggressive and
attack,

604
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:05,950
you can counter and you can take
advantage of,

605
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:06,450
of,
of,

606
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,110
of openings that they leave.
But when someone is just being

607
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:10,750
defensive,
like if Jujitsu,

608
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,820
if you roll with someone,
it's very hard to tap someone who's just

609
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:16,460
being defensive.
They're not trying to attack is when

610
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:19,100
they open up and they go after you.
That's where you can get them.

611
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,960
That's when they leave openings.
And this is saying,

612
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:24,860
I think the same thing with wrestling.
These guys like Mirko Cro cop was a

613
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:27,230
great example when he first started
fighting in pride,

614
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,740
he took,
you know,

615
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,450
just like a year or so and all of a
sudden he had takedown defense figured

616
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:35,900
out and everybody was fucked because
then you've got to stand with this guy.

617
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,680
And he was one of the best examples of a
high level kickboxer that entered into

618
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:44,400
mma because he was always a one shot
explosive

619
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,800
striker.
Whereas a guy like Ernesto hoost was a

620
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:51,120
combination fighter.
A guy who through beautiful technically

621
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:55,800
perfect combinations but never really
like Alec blitzed in and exploded.

622
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,120
And it seems like the blitz is a big
part of MMA fighting.

623
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,140
Yeah,
it's not,

624
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,200
I mean the tactical striking for sure is
important,

625
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,640
but I think you've gotta be able to make
that mark quickly.

626
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:09,930
Especially with those little gloves.

627
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,480
Yeah,
and the f the footwork,

628
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,750
if it gets me over,
gets you over here that I have to take

629
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:18,990
one step just center back into you.
Then you blitz me there.

630
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:23,580
That's when Dominic's doing for the last
number of years and then he start now

631
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,880
get so good at that thing.
You can't quite figure out how to,

632
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:31,560
even like the Anthony Johnson is so good
at staying in balance to hit you

633
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,400
wherever you are.
He's in balance to hit you because Henry

634
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,970
hoofed looked at him and was like,
what's the key to this guy?

635
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,340
Just put them in a place where he can
always hit.

636
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,780
Yeah.
Like put them in a place where you can

637
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:44,190
deliver with power.
He's really good at that.

638
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:45,570
Small little steps,
you know?

639
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,770
And uh,
but dominick Cruz could dance all around

640
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,780
them.
Dominick Cruz can move it so that he has

641
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:52,860
to step back to him.

642
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,770
That's when he'll get in.
Then you get so good at that one thing

643
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,050
and he just starts camouflaging with
other things.

644
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,660
Now you don't know when it's coming now
maybe you hesitate.

645
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,590
Oh,
when you hesitate,

646
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,660
he has an an option.
When you chase,

647
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,390
he has more options.
You think it's better to stay,

648
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,010
to stay still.
So you do.

649
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,660
Then you get beat up.
So then you think,

650
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:11,250
I better get after him.
And then when you do,

651
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:14,070
you get intercepted.
And that whole thing must become so

652
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:15,660
frustrating,
you know,

653
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,220
so mentally frustrating.
Then you're like,

654
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,100
I got to take this guy down.
And in some cases that's what they're

655
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:20,940
waiting for,
you know,

656
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,330
hit you on the way in.
Just that game is so it,

657
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,410
it's,
it feels like the big difference.

658
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:30,000
Now,
if you can't do that,

659
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,050
if I can't do that and you can,
yeah,

660
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,700
what the fuck am I going to do?
Well,

661
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,520
I have to fight.

662
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,290
That was Ali and his is.
Yes.

663
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,030
You know when Ali was young before they
took away his title and he was kicked

664
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:43,670
out of boxing for three years and then
he came back and he's much more flat

665
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:46,280
footed,
but the early days when you would watch

666
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:50,090
Ali fight guys,
he would be able to move away from them

667
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:53,390
and then slide back in and hit them and
they really didn't have a solution to

668
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:55,070
that.
And when you don't have a solution to

669
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:56,570
that,
that means you're getting hit and you're

670
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:58,220
not being able to hit the other guy.

671
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,710
And the just think of that,
you know,

672
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:03,740
you can be ready yourself for that.
You're prepared,

673
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:05,780
you know it's a challenge.
But you've been working on answer.

674
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,650
It's like I thought for sure Duane
Ludwig with Tj,

675
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,660
they would have worked on like
situational things and maybe they did.

676
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,350
It's like when he's here,
we're either going to option a or b.

677
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,870
We know these are some of his choices.
Big,

678
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:23,630
broad strokes,
answers and it worked sometimes.

679
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:25,730
I mean we look back in that fight.
I thought Dominic won,

680
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,900
but Tj had the moments where he had the
biggest shots or the cleanest shots.

681
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,750
There was only half a dozen of them in
25 minutes,

682
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,740
but at you saw that was the answer,
but it must be incredibly frustrating to

683
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,420
be in there.
You're mentally prepared for it.

684
00:29:38,421 --> 00:29:41,560
You got the answers and as the minutes
are clicking away you're like,

685
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,394
oh shit.

686
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,110
It's true.
Someone lied to me.

687
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,490
That feeling,
that must be the worst.

688
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:46,780
When you know you're like,
oh shit,

689
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,860
they lied to me.
What do you mean by that?

690
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,510
There was a Mensa Johnson,
so Phil Davis is like a,

691
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:56,850
I'm a huge fan of felt him,
so I love filterings.

692
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,710
Yeah,
he was fighting Anthony Johnson and he

693
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:03,310
went for that first take down and you go
back and you look the look on his face

694
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:06,400
when he fails that take down.
It's like this is not what I was told it

695
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,590
was going to be.
Maybe somebody lied to me.

696
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:13,270
Sounds like a funny way to say it,
but this is not how it was supposed to

697
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:13,840
go.
Right.

698
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,490
This is not holy fuck Anthony Johnson.
Someone said he I was going to be able

699
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:19,660
to take them down.
I can't,

700
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,900
and that look on his face like that
changes everything.

701
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,490
The whole fight now from this moment
that this big dude stop my takedown,

702
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,250
shook it off and kind of looked at me
now the whole fight is nothing like I

703
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:31,910
had laid it out.
Yeah.

704
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,580
I think,
um,

705
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,990
if dominic,
I think when you wants to Tj fight,

706
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:43,050
like the big moments that Tj had,
I think what Dwayne was twice trying to

707
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:47,470
get him to do more was not load up and
that he was really trying to knock

708
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,750
dominic out.
I mean that's really what he wanted to

709
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:51,700
do.
I think maybe if we just concentrated

710
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:55,540
more on the leg kicks,
I mean he had that one leg where it

711
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:58,510
turned out the dominic had had like a
serious injury with his foot,

712
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,540
like plantar fasciitis and it turned out
that you have you,

713
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,100
what does it like?
Oh God.

714
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,920
So I actually had it after a fight.

715
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,900
My last fight was my best performance
ever and uh,

716
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,860
and it went great and that fight
training,

717
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:15,970
going up to it,
the guy was a very good striker compared

718
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:20,140
to me and uh,
he thought I was going to take him down,

719
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,770
that he assumed,
we knew that he knew that was what I was

720
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,300
going to do.
Only that wasn't what I was going to do.

721
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,290
I,
it's going to put them up against the

722
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:30,100
cage and hauled them there and beat him
up there until he got tired and I could

723
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,500
find a way.
But we were not planning to take them

724
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:33,970
down.
We were planning to put him against the

725
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:36,070
cage,
but all that leverage,

726
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:39,400
like all that driving off the foot
against the cage,

727
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,690
it,
it hurt my foot.

728
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,480
And then we went,
my wife and I went on vacation right

729
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:47,240
after and we walked nonstop the first
day that we were there,

730
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,800
just nonstop.

731
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,850
And the next day the fasciitis happened
and it feels literally like,

732
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,390
like you can't even put weight on your
foot like kids so inflamed and you don't

733
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:59,320
know what it is like did you damage it
is a just hurt and it hurt for months

734
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,030
and months and months and months after
and just yoga actually helped it real.

735
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,070
Yeah.
Strengthening of foot and ankle.

736
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,870
Yeah.
Yoga is one of the things that um,

737
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,420
one of the things that I've found I want
to sort of getting in how much my feet

738
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:11,260
hurt.
Yeah.

739
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,090
Yeah.
Because my feet are weaker.

740
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

741
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,430
Cause you're,
you're big and your feet and ankles are

742
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:22,000
designed to do the stuff that you do to
them and now you're asking them to do

743
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:24,220
all this other stuff.
I was surprised because I felt like,

744
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,650
well I do so much barefoot or lift
weights barefoot.

745
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,690
I kicked the bag,
everything's barefoot.

746
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,380
I was like,
this is not going to be hard to just

747
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:34,510
stand on my feet and hold poses.
But it was pretty hard for like the

748
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:37,890
first couple months I would have like
some serious foot pain,

749
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,950
certain positions.
And then now they're stronger.

750
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,150
Yeah.
Now it's much better.

751
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,880
But still,
that's probably my weakest part is uh,

752
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,300
my balancing,
balancing my foot there as SA.

753
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,170
When you had Carlos and his movement guy
on him and that was one of the things

754
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,490
they talked about.
It's one of the things that you don't

755
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:56,600
portel talks about too is that the,
one of the biggest weaknesses and our

756
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:59,060
whole chain for most of us is our feet
and her ankles.

757
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,650
That's nick curse on his number one
thing.

758
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,150
I said,
what's the number one thing that you

759
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:04,450
like to work on with fighters is like
foot strength flats.

760
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,070
The number one thing that guys have that
they need to,

761
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,140
they need to improve with mine just
fully inflamed for a long time after

762
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:16,130
that fight and just mistreatment and
they were already so what do you do for

763
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:17,270
that?
I literally,

764
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,900
I was in Mexico and I would have to like
sit against,

765
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:25,520
lean on my wife to get to the bar,
to drink some Tequila so that it would

766
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:29,720
hurt a little less so I could get to the
pool where it didn't hurt as much.

767
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,770
Because you had water boiling you,
so will you like taking painkillers are

768
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:35,920
anti inflammatory pain killer since the
last time?

769
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,840
No,
opiates and advil.

770
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,420
Advil.
I literally couldn't walk for three

771
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:42,860
days.
I'm not joking.

772
00:33:42,861 --> 00:33:47,830
I would lean on her to get to the bar to
have some Tequila so that it is the,

773
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:51,140
the Fascia of the bar on the bottom of
the foot that separates is that

774
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,040
separates or inflames and
we got it.

775
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,370
The plantar Fascia.
Yeah.

776
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,380
And I guess it affects people in
different ways.

777
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:03,140
Like if it's,
if it's over,

778
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,880
you know,
if it shortens,

779
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,640
it gets hard and it shortens.
That hurts your foot in other ways.

780
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:10,670
It's just a weird kind of spot.
We're walking on that all day.

781
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:13,220
All the time.
Climbing and fighting and running and

782
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,740
whatever things we do.
And that thing right there is on the

783
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:16,351
bottom.
I mean,

784
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:18,440
you gotta figure that's going to take
some abuse in your life.

785
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,120
They also say a big issue is shoes.
The way,

786
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,130
the padding that we have on shoes,
the extra like the runner's padding in

787
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,660
there,
you're really supposed to have like the

788
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:29,990
most minimal amount of protection from
the environment as possible.

789
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,760
Just a thin minimalist type of a shoe
that and that allows us to use our feet.

790
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,040
The thing we got is just a big lump on
it,

791
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,570
you know,
so you don't get to use it.

792
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,950
Uh,
but when,

793
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,910
when you train in taekwondo growing up
like martial arts for kids like kids and

794
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:44,960
teenagers and stuff,
man,

795
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:46,400
it's just kind of make everything
better,

796
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,990
you know?
Definitely flexibility.

797
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,720
Yeah.
I still really flexible at 48.

798
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,940
I mean it's,
cause I'd never stopped doing it,

799
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:56,150
but it's also because I started doing it
before my body grew up.

800
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,930
Right.
Yeah.

801
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,040
You know,
but the,

802
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,620
the,
what they're saying now is that like

803
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,250
navy seals that are learning going
through training and everything with

804
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:05,720
those toe shoes.

805
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,820
Yeah.
They're trying to stop them from wearing

806
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:11,330
those toe shoes because so many guys
that are feet are not strong enough to

807
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:14,630
run and do all these exercises in those
things because they're used to wearing

808
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:17,210
like you basic running shoe with a thick
heel.

809
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,530
Have you ever,
um,

810
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,050
people are listening to this?
Uh,

811
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:26,030
I think there's a Ted talk about it
where they went over how someone had

812
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:30,980
created one of those running shoes with
the thick heel area and what did it done

813
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:33,050
is really essentially change the way
people run.

814
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,300
It changed their gate and it made people
run.

815
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,350
He'll first,
which is totally unnatural.

816
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,010
You're supposed to

817
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,910
run like ball of the foot first and your
foot's supposed to absorb the energy.

818
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,850
And when you do that,
you know your foot access sort of like a

819
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,450
spring and it slows you down at
decelerates you and that's how you're

820
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:50,340
supposed to run.
You push off that and you run with that.

821
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,540
If you do that,
your,

822
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,350
your foot will be very strong and you
could run long distances and your foot

823
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:58,710
will stay healthy.
But if you're used to using those

824
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:01,950
running shoes with the big heel,
you go heel down first.

825
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,710
You don't have that strength in your
foot and you can get really fucking

826
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:06,570
injured.
If you try to do the same amount of

827
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:10,050
miles and the same intense workout would
like a toe shoe or something like that

828
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,030
because your feet are just not designed
for it yet.

829
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,370
Or you know,
conditioned for it.

830
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:14,790
Rather.

831
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,800
The funny thing like when you know,
they're telling them not to use these

832
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,310
shoes because they're feet aren't strong
enough,

833
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,070
but if they use the shoes,
their feet will become strong enough,

834
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:24,600
you know,
but they want them to go through some

835
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:28,170
pretty fucking ruling,
rigorous soul searching,

836
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,820
you know,
workouts.

837
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,370
Um,
and uh,

838
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,750
we had talked about I was hurt,
I did yoga.

839
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,130
It fixed it.
You did yoga.

840
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,450
It hurt.
Now it's better.

841
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,940
Like you'll have to go through a certain
amount of heart.

842
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:40,380
You have to go through a certain amount
of,

843
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,420
you know,
challenge to repair it,

844
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,710
you know?
But it's,

845
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:46,620
it strikes me so strange when you think
about some things that we,

846
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,340
that humans do,
something as small or big as gone,

847
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,690
well,
we're going to wear these shoes,

848
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,170
changes everything.
Not only how we are our future,

849
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,510
the way,
like these little things that we do as,

850
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,353
as people.

851
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,110
You don't,
you never,

852
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,410
you're never able to project the good
and the bad outcomes of them in the

853
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:05,970
future.
You just have to deal with them when

854
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:06,751
they happen.
Yeah.

855
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:08,070
I'm,
I'm a big fan.

856
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,720
Um,
when it comes to like minimalist

857
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:11,990
footwear,
I'm a big fan of wearing like real,

858
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,370
I workout with the either barefoot or
these.

859
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,830
I have these new balances lists like a
slipper.

860
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,080
Yeah.
I have the exact same black,

861
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:21,480
but they're like this little thin thing
while we're the toe shoes.

862
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:24,280
But goddamn people give you a hard time.
Yeah,

863
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,430
me too.
Brutal.

864
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,640
I have those new balance once.
I do still do a lot of power lifting.

865
00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:31,200
I love power lifting.
I just love it.

866
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:34,560
Yeah.
I tried to do yoga and martial arts and

867
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,030
an offset,
but I love heavy lifting and deadlifts.

868
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,800
You can't use padding.
You'll,

869
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:44,830
you're gonna lose force and we have to
use some time usually or I'll use the

870
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:47,940
new balance ones,
but I'm not Nike's rather converse all

871
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:49,860
star like these things,
the chucks

872
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,900
favorite cause they're just flat,
they're flat and there's a very thin and

873
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:56,000
you can kind of feed the,
they're real flexible,

874
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:56,834
you know,
like,

875
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,360
like you will you,
if you climb something with these

876
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,640
things,
they like bend and give.

877
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,560
It's not like a rigid thing.

878
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:04,723
No.
Uh,

879
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,490
have you ever done a power lifting meet?
Yeah.

880
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,990
It's Super Fun,
man.

881
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:10,200
You do it.
You go and he,

882
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,450
yeah,
you go and compete.

883
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:13,500
Compete in the hour.
That wasn't my,

884
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,170
I won the nationals at my age and
weight.

885
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,540
Holy Shit.
I traded this place.

886
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,150
How much do you,
what do you lift and how much you want.

887
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Then I would weigh about one 55 and I'll
deadlift maybe like three 63 zero a lot

888
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,130
of weight.
And then my benches maybe two 30,

889
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,470
two 40,
which doesn't sound like a lot of weight

890
00:38:30,471 --> 00:38:32,690
to people who go to the gym and just
throw it around.

891
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:33,260
But,
uh,

892
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,440
a one 55,
that's a of weight,

893
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,040
but a power lifting.
Um,

894
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,940
like at a regulation,
a bench press,

895
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,130
you bring it down,
it's got to stop all movement and you

896
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:43,900
wait for the command to push.
So it's,

897
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,290
it's how long do you wait until all
moving to stop?

898
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,160
Might be one.
Second.

899
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,480
Could be two.
Could be three.

900
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,260
They say press.
So you can't bounce it on no bounds.

901
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,760
Stop all movement and press from that
spot.

902
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,040
But I trained at this place.
I love it.

903
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,120
I just,
I love it.

904
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,820
Um,
and uh,

905
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,780
in Toronto,
my wife comes now too.

906
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,930
And uh,
I brought her at first because she

907
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:06,820
always wanted me to cancel because it
was caught in the morning.

908
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:08,780
She's like,
why don't we just go get for breakfast?

909
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,633
There's,
well,

910
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,260
why do you have to go to the gym
tomorrow?

911
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,120
So then I just started.
Yeah,

912
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,043
yeah.
Well not,

913
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,980
she's cool man.
I like she temptresses temptress she is

914
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,600
super cool,
but I was just like,

915
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,770
she's,
you know,

916
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,830
she's always like,
oh,

917
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,220
just skip one.
So I started with,

918
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:24,850
got her going.
Now she loves it too.

919
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:28,150
But tons of women power lift now and
yeah.

920
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,080
Yeah.
And it's,

921
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,250
it shouldn't be the only thing that you
do because weightlifting,

922
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,730
you,
you mentioned you lifted weights all

923
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:36,280
your life and all of a sudden you did
yoga and it added so much.

924
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,820
But if you're lifting weights and doing
movement and doing yoga and doing

925
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:42,040
flexibility stuffs,
but that's hard to do.

926
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,860
That goes right back to what we said.
You've got to work out,

927
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:46,980
you got to eat,
go to and you got to sleep or else you

928
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,040
won't have a good life.
Well,

929
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,320
how does it,
how most people don't have the time to

930
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,270
do all the different things you would
need to do?

931
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,630
So one of the most frustrating things
about people that get into Jujitsu is

932
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:58,060
they just do Jujitsu.
And I'm always like,

933
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,220
man,
you really should lift some weights.

934
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,610
Especially if you're getting older.
Like it's one of the most important

935
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:08,140
things to preserve the joints,
like keeping muscle tissue strong and

936
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:10,270
healthy,
and making sure that you've got good

937
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:14,770
muscle density that protect those joints
because you know you're engaging in a

938
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:19,300
form of combat on a regular basis and
you're doing no strengthening other than

939
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:20,134
that combat.

940
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,770
So we are people,
when you go to the gym,

941
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,710
you see them white tie guys and they're
standing around and move in and stuff.

942
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,420
That Jujitsu guys are sitting around
chatting,

943
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:32,020
right?
So that mood makes you feel like it's

944
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:34,780
not combat.
And then you do Jujitsu and it's fucking

945
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:37,990
fighting and you know,
as it's physically fighting,

946
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:41,500
your joints are fighting.
And I think the mood of it makes it feel

947
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:42,010
like,
ah,

948
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,530
you know,
so it's a bit of a stoner sport in some

949
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:46,540
ways.
Guys just chill out and they're wearing

950
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,340
the pajamas hanging out.
But it's fighting,

951
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,080
you know,
if you're getting caught and things,

952
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,630
you know,
just trying to fight out of them or

953
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:55,720
trying to not tap,
you put tremendous amount of pressure on

954
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:57,910
your joints.
Tremendous amount of pressure on your

955
00:40:57,911 --> 00:40:59,260
neck,
on your back.

956
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,600
The Lowe's,
a lot of pressure on your back to try to

957
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:02,890
get out of situations.

958
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,550
You're contorting yourself often,
you know,

959
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:07,240
and you really need to be strong in
those areas.

960
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:09,460
And flexible,
flexible is a big one.

961
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:12,520
It's very important.
I took a first time I met Eddy,

962
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:17,310
I took his seminar and Eddie's got a
room full of people and I think he maybe

963
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,720
had hard him say this before in a video
or something.

964
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,290
And if people are stretching and he
says,

965
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,910
well you gotta you gotta work on that.
And somebody said,

966
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:26,740
well this is as flexible as I am.
And he's like,

967
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,500
that is a very north American line of
thinking.

968
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,860
And no other place where people go,
this is as flexible as I am.

969
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,900
They'd say this is as flexible as I am
right now.

970
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,720
If I work at it,
I will become more flexible,

971
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,140
like everything in life.
But for some reason we have these

972
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:43,970
limiting beliefs.
You know,

973
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,040
it's like if,
do you know how to play piano?

974
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,940
No,
no.

975
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,240
But you could learn how to play piano if
it was important to you and then the

976
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,110
fingers work.
Yeah.

977
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,840
And in six weeks you'd be a better piano
player than you are today.

978
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,940
And in three years you'd be away.
Better Piano player.

979
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,100
That's true of every single thing in
life.

980
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,310
And,
and one of the reasons I learned stuff

981
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,170
from,
from studying fighters,

982
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,870
like I learned stuff about life,
lots of stuff,

983
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,260
but one of those big ones is that growth
mindset.

984
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,350
The idea that if we put in time on
anything,

985
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,310
it'll get better.
And the work itself is the point that

986
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,120
thing for some,
if,

987
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,140
if a kid has that,
their whole life is better,

988
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,660
if any.
And we can have it at 40 or 50 or 60.

989
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:26,540
The idea that whatever I am is not what
I am.

990
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,820
It's what I am today,
but I can improve those things.

991
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,890
I love that.
That's a great attitude.

992
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:34,190
That's a great way to say it.
Whenever I am is what I am today.

993
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,520
Yeah.
It's like,

994
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,070
I mean,
people,

995
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,680
I talk about this guy,
I like this little thing.

996
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:41,830
This thing's pretty cool.
Uh,

997
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,570
I talked about that guy a lot and
people,

998
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,470
we were talking about people hating
sometime people that they see on tv.

999
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,930
Some people hate this guy,
Garcia.

1000
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,670
He talks a lot of shit.
Yeah,

1001
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,650
for sure.
Exactly.

1002
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,750
Exactly.
You put it perfectly.

1003
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,420
Um,
but the thing that guy has is that

1004
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:04,421
insane growth mindset think it's to him
anything is possible.

1005
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,850
I believe anything is possible.
But if you win a 155 belt,

1006
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,190
okay,
you go fight for fight Robbie.

1007
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,660
Okay.
If you one that,

1008
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:18,020
what are you going to fight?
Rockhold and then you know,

1009
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,910
John John's,
there are limits.

1010
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,560
You know what I mean?
There are fucking limits,

1011
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,770
but he actually believes there are none
in that belief.

1012
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,530
He's better at everything than he was
yesterday and he's still rockhold kick

1013
00:43:28,531 --> 00:43:30,530
some butt.
You realize

1014
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,680
that's what I,
that's what I'm saying.

1015
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:36,980
There's gotta be a point.
But that belief that there is no point,

1016
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,990
that belief that there is no limit
whatsoever is incredibly powerful when

1017
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:44,720
it's put together with a drive of a work
ethic,

1018
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:48,140
with an insane work ethic.
That is a powerful thing.

1019
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,150
Well,
it's interesting too because with

1020
00:43:50,151 --> 00:43:51,860
fighters,
when they're in camp,

1021
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,010
most of the time you're preparing for a
specific opponent.

1022
00:43:55,011 --> 00:43:59,510
You're not really picking up new skills.
The way they really pick up skills is by

1023
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,570
training and taking chances and going
outside the comfort zone,

1024
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,420
which is really not something you want
to do while you're conditioning yourself

1025
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:08,060
for a fight.
So when a lot of times when guys are

1026
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:10,280
going back to back to back and they're
fighting along,

1027
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,890
then I'm really improving.
Much they're doing is just,

1028
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,830
they're improving their ability to
compete because they're getting more

1029
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:17,330
comfortable because they're competing a
lot.

1030
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,880
They're getting relaxed,
they're in great shape and uh,

1031
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,220
they're getting used to the feeling of
being in competition.

1032
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:23,410
But man,
there's,

1033
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:28,310
there's not a lot of time to take some
time to just go over new stuff,

1034
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:30,770
to learn new things,
to add new weapons.

1035
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:32,010
Well,
when I talked to

1036
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,530
him and his coach,
Kevin now,

1037
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:36,030
who I only spoke to you briefly,
actually,

1038
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:41,031
I tried to contact him to ask him if I
could pick his mind a bit before doing

1039
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:43,510
this breakdown.
I took it as a big compliment that he's

1040
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,070
like,
Nah,

1041
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,200
uh,
of maybe chat with you after like that.

1042
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:47,850
If he gave me something I might pass it
on.

1043
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:49,370
I took it as a compliment.
Um,

1044
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,520
and I do a podcast,
uh,

1045
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,200
the mentality of combat sports and I do
it with my very good friend David

1046
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,120
Mullins.
Is it on itunes?

1047
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,440
No,
it is or will be.

1048
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:00,690
We're not super on top of that.
How long have you been doing?

1049
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,510
We've been doing it for a year with a
fuck,

1050
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,930
you know,
it's on,

1051
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:04,980
it's on youtube.
It's

1052
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,380
on youtube.
Yeah.

1053
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:11,100
But well it either has been on itunes
for a few months or it's in the process.

1054
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,170
We got a guy who does that.
Um,

1055
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,161
uh,
but,

1056
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:15,330
uh,
so,

1057
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,630
and I've been doing with him and he is
part of the SPG team.

1058
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:20,880
He's the these straight blast gym.
Yeah,

1059
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:25,020
the combat this sports psychology coach
of the team.

1060
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,970
Oh.
And when I asked him about Khan and

1061
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:28,260
we're very good friends,
um,

1062
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,730
but when I ask him about connor,
he says,

1063
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:34,230
conor is his own coach.
But I know at the same time when you

1064
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,680
work with the coach,
his,

1065
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,600
his own mental coach,
he's on his own journey and not that he

1066
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:43,290
doesn't want information from David,
but he wants it from 50 sources.

1067
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:48,291
He's consuming,
consuming like a philosophy and ideas of

1068
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:52,050
how to improve and ideas of what it is
to be your authentic self,

1069
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:54,720
peak performance,
all that kind of stuff's not constantly

1070
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:59,280
consuming it but at Shell mate,
but my inside Info that I get from David

1071
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:00,210
working with them,
he's like,

1072
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,800
they don't train for really for an
opponent Fr Railey they,

1073
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,350
the opponent is,
he's not a person.

1074
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:12,090
He is a collection of skills and
attributes and a body type and that's

1075
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:14,120
it.
And we are training to get better every

1076
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:17,070
day.
The goal is to be better not to train

1077
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,380
and,
and why is that a good thing among the

1078
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:23,020
millions of reasons Josie Aldos out.
Chad Mendez is in,

1079
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,560
if you spent all that time training for
Josie Aldo and only Josie,

1080
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:28,800
all Dell,
oh my God,

1081
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:30,780
Chad Mendez in questions,
doubts,

1082
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,070
concerns,
what are we doing?

1083
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:33,690
Game Plan.
Instead,

1084
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,910
he was like,
it doesn't matter who it is.

1085
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,910
Wow.
And they train to get better every

1086
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,830
single day in everything.
Wow.

1087
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,090
And that's okay.

1088
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,950
Great Mindset.
If you can pull it off,

1089
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,800
he's pulling it off.
He is pulling it off right now.

1090
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,840
I wonder how much of what he's doing,
what he's able to do is his own unique

1091
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:54,180
physical gifts.
Um,

1092
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,360
the,
the fact that he's been so successful so

1093
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:00,630
far with this strategy and he,
he,

1094
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,970
he know also the people that he's
training with.

1095
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:04,770
He's got it like fantastic training
partners,

1096
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:08,040
great grappling with Gunnar Nelson.
Great coaching and why,

1097
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,210
you know,
I wonder what,

1098
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,260
I wonder if that is the way to do it.
Cause I wonder is there going to come a

1099
00:47:13,261 --> 00:47:15,900
time where he faces another guy like
him,

1100
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,680
like a guy that on that level,
and maybe it's Hofeld does Angela,

1101
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:20,660
maybe it is,
you know,

1102
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,330
um,
I just sent the breakdown in,

1103
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,200
uh,
and that Craig at the UFC said it's good

1104
00:47:27,201 --> 00:47:29,090
to God.
So they'll release it when their

1105
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,940
department does stuff.
So it's coming out in the next day or

1106
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,670
breakdowns are fucking awesome,
man.

1107
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:34,600
Really,
really love them.

1108
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,670
I love doing them.
I can't tell one,

1109
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,990
eight to 10 days,
but that's of work on it.

1110
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,740
The ideas came over the last years,
like just,

1111
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,440
but uh,
how long has the piece,

1112
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,140
it's four minutes.
Let's play.

1113
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,580
Can we play it?
And now I can't play it.

1114
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,880
I know.
I know.

1115
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,470
We can't talk her.
Uh,

1116
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,360
it's Eh,
tab.

1117
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,240
I know I've already thanked you,
but thank you for making that happen.

1118
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:58,871
Oh,
please.

1119
00:47:58,871 --> 00:47:59,890
My pleasure man.
Up like,

1120
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,340
uh,
when you recommended my stuff to Dana,

1121
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:08,500
I flew down to the office with him and
Craig and Dana and I were literally

1122
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:10,720
standing up acting out stuff while we
were talking.

1123
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,620
It was really,
really,

1124
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:15,870
really exciting and cool and it is cool
to be doing that for the UFC.

1125
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,980
Oh,
it's awesome to have you,

1126
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:17,814
man.
Yeah.

1127
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,331
Yeah.
Well,

1128
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:21,090
when you first started doing,
and we became friends and I would watch

1129
00:48:21,091 --> 00:48:21,870
your stuff,
I'd,

1130
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,790
you know,
I just immediately was saying like,

1131
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:26,040
why this guy should be doing this for
the UFC.

1132
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,080
I mean,
your stuff is awesome.

1133
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:28,680
Yeah,
thank you.

1134
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,830
He puts so much thought into it.
There's so much and now and you can get

1135
00:48:31,831 --> 00:48:34,500
so much out of it as a fan and someone
is like,

1136
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:36,690
look,
this fight is God damn apic.

1137
00:48:36,691 --> 00:48:40,200
This conor Mcgregor Hofeld dos Anjos
fight is an epic super fight.

1138
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,730
It's two champions in their prime,
one of them coming off of a stunning 13

1139
00:48:44,731 --> 00:48:48,360
second knockout to win the title.
The other one coming off of a brutal

1140
00:48:48,361 --> 00:48:50,490
beat down of one of the most popular
contenders.

1141
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,820
I mean dos Anjos looks like a goddamned
murderer and connor looks like a freak.

1142
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,160
He does and he's like,
just these,

1143
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:57,660
these two guys.
It's perfect.

1144
00:48:57,661 --> 00:49:01,830
It's the perfect fight.
So to get some technical insight and to

1145
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:04,340
get a view into what your thoughts
aren't,

1146
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:08,280
footwork and movement and what dos Anjos
could possibly do to mitigate some of

1147
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:10,380
that footwork,
what's going to happen if conor gets on

1148
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:14,610
his back though way Mendez got him on
his back because dos Anjos is a lot

1149
00:49:14,611 --> 00:49:17,850
bigger,
a lot stronger and dangerous as fuck

1150
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,170
with his submissions.
Yeah,

1151
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:22,080
Chad Sephora really submitted people
that guillotine bad,

1152
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:25,850
but conard use that threat to get up.
But Chad was,

1153
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:30,510
Chad was two weeks for that fire plus
all the media obligations.

1154
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,530
There is no way a guy who's got a
wrestling heavy strategy like Chad does,

1155
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,710
you're not going to be conditioned
enough to go five rounds if two with two

1156
00:49:37,711 --> 00:49:40,710
weeks he had to knock him out.
And so he went in hard and early he

1157
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:42,900
pushed all his chips in.
Connor's got a chin.

1158
00:49:42,901 --> 00:49:46,170
It's made out of some fucking the same
shit that wolverines bones are made out

1159
00:49:46,171 --> 00:49:47,070
of.
Adam Manteo.

1160
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,640
Oh my God.
I never seen anybody take a Chad Mendez

1161
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:51,474
Punch to the face.

1162
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,700
Gotcha.
And uh,

1163
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,420
he's,
he was getting hit with a right hand

1164
00:49:56,421 --> 00:49:57,930
corner.
He was getting hit with it,

1165
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,900
whether or not now,
I mean,

1166
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,240
uh,
does annual says a southpaw too,

1167
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,740
so it changes things and he has seen
knocked out pour.

1168
00:50:04,741 --> 00:50:07,280
Ea was a south part and I think Brandao
is a southpaw too.

1169
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:11,100
So he's has dealt with them.
But on the other hand does Anjos took a

1170
00:50:11,101 --> 00:50:12,240
Ben Henderson.
Yeah.

1171
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,440
South Park.
A pedes switches.

1172
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,380
Yeah.
Uh,

1173
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,070
Jason High was a South Pollack.
He's face planning of us.

1174
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,003
Please.
Yeah.

1175
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,330
It's interesting,
but uh,

1176
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:23,240
uh,
breaking that stuff down when I looked

1177
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:27,080
at it.
So my real goal is to,

1178
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,350
to try to influence.
So I feel watch fighting and to make

1179
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:32,630
them see it the way that I see it.
That's the actual goal.

1180
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,810
The goal is that I see this crazy,
unbelievable stuff happening underneath

1181
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:41,570
some of the surface and I want to
entertain people long enough that I can

1182
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,950
trick them into learning some of it.

1183
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,810
And that's,
that's the plan.

1184
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,570
And trick them into learning.
That's funny.

1185
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,090
You just want to entertain them,
make sure they're having a good time.

1186
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,100
And at the end of it,
they are walking around going the,

1187
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,720
and by the way,
that kick works this way.

1188
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:57,200
And they do it because if you go and you
just stand there and you're like,

1189
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:59,840
have a diagram and you know,
I think that was,

1190
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:03,230
there was always outside of like people
were learning,

1191
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:06,830
fighting from your commentary and then
there wouldn't be another show.

1192
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,220
So then they'd have to come back and
they'd learned during the fights,

1193
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,530
which is great.
I mean that was your,

1194
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,950
you did more to educate people by
fighting than any person ever.

1195
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:16,790
Probably.
I mean,

1196
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:19,040
I can't think off the top of my head.
Anybody who has

1197
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,390
contributed more knowledge of fighting
and it was done.

1198
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:25,130
You're entertaining,
you're having fun.

1199
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:26,900
It's,
they love your voice.

1200
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,960
So that was the learning.
But then there's not another fight now

1201
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,030
for a few weeks live.
We should learn some shit in the

1202
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:35,390
meantime and we should get you prepared
so you don't have to teach them

1203
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,490
everything about this fight in the fight
while calling the fight and making shits

1204
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,340
entertaining.
We got to get you prepped to a,

1205
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:42,174
some knowledge.

1206
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,020
Well,
there's never been a time like this

1207
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,750
before where you could get so many
different breakdowns,

1208
00:51:46,751 --> 00:51:50,230
like the Gracie breakdowns of
submissions that a Henna and he,

1209
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,680
Ron Do,
Lawrence Kanchan starts to Jack slap

1210
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:55,330
stuff.
There's so much good.

1211
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:56,920
So who's the guy that Kenny was
plagiarizing?

1212
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,000
Uh,
yeah,

1213
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,800
I forget his name off the top of my
head.

1214
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,330
Yeah,
that was a weird situation.

1215
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,620
Uh,
did you talk about that?

1216
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,350
Did you talk about that much?
Because you are a guy who would not

1217
00:52:05,351 --> 00:52:07,780
happen in comedy do you were not having
that?

1218
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,410
No,
not really a,

1219
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,030
but it wasn't good.
You know,

1220
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:13,480
it would Kenny's take on it is that
Kenny,

1221
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,850
uh,
he writes a lot of notes and he's been

1222
00:52:15,851 --> 00:52:17,980
writing notes for years and years and
that's,

1223
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:19,450
uh,
that's what happened.

1224
00:52:19,451 --> 00:52:21,490
He just failed to attribute,
which,

1225
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:22,780
you know,
may maybe the case,

1226
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:23,330
I don't know.
Yeah.

1227
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,960
Yeah.
But I liked the fact that,

1228
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:26,850
uh,
we found out.

1229
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:27,170
Yeah.

1230
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,190
Lee Wiley.
That's right.

1231
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:29,420
Yeah.
He does great stuff.

1232
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,370
There's a lot of really ugly pebble
video.

1233
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,510
That's right.
Excellent.

1234
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:33,440
Yeah.
If it's very good,

1235
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,670
uh,
there's a lot.

1236
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:39,671
And when I was started to do analysis,
there wasn't a lot and I was hoping now,

1237
00:52:40,821 --> 00:52:42,260
just like when you started doing a
podcast,

1238
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:43,940
you have,
you had hundreds of people say,

1239
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:45,250
I started a podcast.
Yeah.

1240
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,570
And just like I get guys emailing me,
hey,

1241
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:51,440
I'm doing an analysis and I think,
and I wasn't the guy who started it.

1242
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:53,020
I can't take any credit for that.
Um,

1243
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,540
but when people get it excitedly,
people were like,

1244
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:57,230
oh,
shit.

1245
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,810
Fighting is way more interesting than
just,

1246
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,750
I mean,
the real thing that kind of would bother

1247
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:05,130
me is that wasn't,
you know,

1248
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,140
a fight.
What happened,

1249
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,910
this awesome stuff.
What happened?

1250
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:09,540
Crazy things that had,
you know,

1251
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:13,040
change the way that you understood how
people moved and what happened when

1252
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:17,120
trained athletes fought each other and
it meant something to him the next time

1253
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:19,340
that you'd fight the way they move,
all that stuff and then people would be

1254
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:20,031
like,
all right,

1255
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,740
he got it done at two minutes or the
fifth,

1256
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,150
uh,
two minutes of the third round.

1257
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,010
What's next for this guy?
Which is,

1258
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:28,200
that's a great conversation to,
or what does this mean for the title

1259
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:29,490
rankings?
Or you know,

1260
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:33,480
who are you going to call out?
It was incest instantly looking ahead,

1261
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,190
fighting immediately was like,
well,

1262
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:36,690
what's the next fight and how's it going
to go down?

1263
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,330
No amount of like,
what does it mean,

1264
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:40,290
what happened?
I mean,

1265
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:45,560
we're taking human beings at the highest
level of training and in a global

1266
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:50,190
experiment to figure out what is the
ultimate way that human beings can do

1267
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:53,100
combat.
And we're putting them there at personal

1268
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:57,780
risk to themselves for our entertainment
and brilliant shit happens.

1269
00:53:57,781 --> 00:53:59,490
We can't just move on.
We can't just go,

1270
00:53:59,491 --> 00:53:59,881
oh,
well,

1271
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:03,160
you know,
Johnny one or a GSP one or whatever.

1272
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,260
Well,
what's his next fight?

1273
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,630
We got it.
We got to honor that fight.

1274
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,200
We've got to honor the fact that these
guys are giving that stuff.

1275
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,130
Why didn't we both agree that the
fighters of today,

1276
00:54:12,131 --> 00:54:17,131
of the greatest fighters ever and the
audience is far more knowledgeable today

1277
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:20,090
than they've ever been before?
So when we're watching all these

1278
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:23,980
breakdowns and all these different
technique videos like you,

1279
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:27,140
you have so much more access to mixed
martial arts knowledge.

1280
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,280
It's,
it's an incredible,

1281
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,950
like you ever follow any of those,
a Bjj,

1282
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:32,300
a video,
um,

1283
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,230
uh,
one's on instagram.

1284
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,720
Yeah.
Like viral Bjj.

1285
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,130
Holy Shit,
man.

1286
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,080
Yeah.
Some of those fucking moves.

1287
00:54:39,081 --> 00:54:39,950
Like,
I've never seen those.

1288
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:43,110
I've been doing Jujitsu for 22 years.
I never seen some of those moves raise.

1289
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,980
He's incredible.
Some of these guys have like some sick

1290
00:54:45,981 --> 00:54:47,420
fucking transitions.
Yeah.

1291
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,740
Amazing stuff.

1292
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:49,650
Yeah.
It,

1293
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,010
Jujitsu is a whole other fascinating
world of its own right now,

1294
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,031
but uh,
yeah,

1295
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:59,031
I just loved now that it's like it isn't
just the outcome or the storyline around

1296
00:54:59,161 --> 00:55:02,670
it or the shit talking.
People are interested in the fight.

1297
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:06,600
Like the thing that's happening when
these geniuses are actually moving.

1298
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,090
That just makes me,
I'm glad that's happening.

1299
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,881
I'm so glad.
Yeah.

1300
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:12,690
That's happening now because that
happens in other sports too.

1301
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:15,840
Eventually at first just got to see
homeruns man,

1302
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:17,700
we're just going to sit around until the
home runs happen.

1303
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,170
Or like what if you're in football?
People who love football didn't

1304
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,400
understand.
They were just bored out of their tree

1305
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:27,360
booing when they ran the football one
yard and they only chaired when it was

1306
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:28,650
like a long bomb,
you know?

1307
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:30,360
Right.
That's what happened.

1308
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,150
To some degree in fighting guys will get
be against the fence or guys would be

1309
00:55:33,151 --> 00:55:36,060
grappling and people would be like,
oh,

1310
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,670
when is the,
the fighting going to happen?

1311
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:38,491
We still see that.
Yeah,

1312
00:55:38,491 --> 00:55:39,000
we do.

1313
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,170
We still see that especially when we go
to like different markets outside of

1314
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:46,230
Vegas and the audience is not that
educated and they start booing when it

1315
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:47,064
goes to the ground.

1316
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,480
Yeah.
Crazy.

1317
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,670
Crazy.
It sucks.

1318
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:54,360
Um,
I commentated taekwondo for the Pan Am

1319
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:54,691
Games.
Really?

1320
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:57,390
Yeah.
And I connotated as like eight,

1321
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:01,410
maybe more like 10 or 12 traditional
martial arts in Russia for the world

1322
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:02,580
combat games.
Wow.

1323
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,640
And it's super cool and I'm just seeing
that Brazilian Jujitsu is moving the way

1324
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,370
that those sports moved in a lot of
ways.

1325
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:16,371
Like taekwondo was awesome commentating
that and the Mexican team won almost all

1326
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:19,410
the metals.
Really?

1327
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:23,680
Yeah,
because you can punch as we all know,

1328
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,120
but we don't do it because our coaches
and the way that we've taught and the

1329
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:30,670
way we've celebrated the spinning and
beautiful techniques,

1330
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,350
that's what we're doing.
The,

1331
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:36,340
that space in between you and me being
able to kick each other from here.

1332
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:39,460
The Mexican team entered that space,
took it away and punched you in the body

1333
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,350
and they want almost all in like body
punches,

1334
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:45,640
body punches,
one almost cost and it's like the sport

1335
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:50,200
itself kind of agrees to do taekwondo
and that happens in every sport and in

1336
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:50,770
Jujitsu.

1337
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:54,250
Now I love Jujitsu,
but sports,

1338
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:58,930
Jujitsu isn't really fighting anymore.
All this bear and Bolo and all these

1339
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:00,520
interesting stuff,
they're beautiful.

1340
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:05,460
It's fascinating and amazing sport.
But if we are in an environment where we

1341
00:57:05,461 --> 00:57:10,150
are going to sort of unconsciously agree
that these are there structures and

1342
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:13,060
rules,
we have the sport changes as soon as you

1343
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:15,100
remove punching,
like a lot of these things,

1344
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:19,030
certain defenses to things as punch.
So once we remove that you get this

1345
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:22,930
beautiful cool sport but it moves
further away from fighting the same way

1346
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:24,490
every other martial art did.
Well

1347
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,180
it can,
but it also doesn't have to like what

1348
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:29,440
is,
one of the things I really love about

1349
00:57:29,441 --> 00:57:32,890
what John Danaher is doing with Eddie
Commons and Gary Tonin and these,

1350
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,770
these assassins that he's got out of
Hens Zos in New York,

1351
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:40,300
is they're figuring out a way to use
these leg lock transitions in a way that

1352
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:42,760
it's not dangerous to do.
Like you would always,

1353
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:47,260
the traditional thought was when a guy
goes for a leg and if you do it

1354
00:57:47,261 --> 00:57:48,700
improperly,
it is the truth.

1355
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:51,340
You're committing to arms to the leg and
you're not gonna be able to defend

1356
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:54,490
against punches.
We saw that with Frank Mir versus Ian,

1357
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,331
the machine.
Freeman.

1358
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:59,110
Remember that fight frank was gone for
that heel hook and Ian just kept

1359
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:01,420
punching him in the fucking face and you
know,

1360
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,660
and they stopped him while he wasn't
tapping and he's just slamming him in

1361
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:05,810
the face when

1362
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,490
Alan Belcher,
when he was fighting,

1363
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,450
what's his name?
Paul Harris.

1364
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:11,260
Yeah.
You don't see that anymore.

1365
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:12,390
Um,
with the,

1366
00:58:12,391 --> 00:58:14,440
the highest level Jujitsu guys,
they put,

1367
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:15,700
they're putting themselves in a
position,

1368
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:18,490
first of all,
when a guy like gary tonin or eddie

1369
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:22,240
cummings grabs a hold of your leg,
you have fractions of a second before

1370
00:58:22,241 --> 00:58:24,430
your knee explodes.
And so you,

1371
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,980
the,
the transitions and the technique is so

1372
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:30,130
tight,
you don't have that space to swing wild

1373
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,470
punches.
They're not giving it to,

1374
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:35,020
they are putting you in a very,
very dangerous spot immediately.

1375
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,920
And it's the technique and the thought
process behind it and whether it's

1376
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:40,150
perfected by Donna,
her,

1377
00:58:40,151 --> 00:58:42,880
a bunch of other people.
I know dean lister was initially a part

1378
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:45,310
of that as well.
He taught those guys a lot and he was

1379
00:58:45,311 --> 00:58:47,980
one of the early leg lock masters.
But these guys are,

1380
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:52,420
they're doing it in a way where these
techniques that I might've agreed with

1381
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:55,210
you just a few years ago really aren't
for mma,

1382
00:58:55,211 --> 00:58:57,070
like the 50,
50 and stuff like that.

1383
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,830
You're seeing those really applied MMA
now.

1384
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,300
Yeah.
The cool thing about the cool thing

1385
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:05,040
about fighting,
like everything is cool,

1386
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:07,200
you know,
um,

1387
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,000
but a another and a long list of cool
things is,

1388
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,150
uh,
it's how the money that exists.

1389
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:17,310
Like when we talk about why the UFC is a
great thing.

1390
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:22,430
I think that UFC is an awesome thing
when you monetize something more study

1391
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:26,450
and things happen to it.
As soon as,

1392
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,030
as soon as you say you can become
wealthy,

1393
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:32,660
if you get good at this gyms and
businesses and things can pop up around

1394
00:59:32,661 --> 00:59:34,670
it,
it's speeds the evolution of how things

1395
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,710
happen.
And uh,

1396
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:41,770
because Emma May exist as a way to get
paid for doing fighting it.

1397
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:45,590
W uh,
guys like Danaher will arc back with

1398
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:48,080
their study of,
of the martial art back to where they

1399
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:50,660
get paid,
which is fighting the UFC.

1400
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:52,690
Well,
it's interesting because you need a guy

1401
00:59:52,691 --> 00:59:55,960
like a Donna her,
you need one of those genius guys to

1402
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:58,960
just try to figure out what's the best
way to approach this.

1403
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,510
Where are the problems?
Well,

1404
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:03,700
the problems keep happening happening
when you're going into the,

1405
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,650
the transition and the guy grabs this
leg.

1406
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:07,060
Okay.
How do we stop that?

1407
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,350
Well,
let's look at it backwards.

1408
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:09,940
Let's do,
let's attack it from this side.

1409
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:14,470
Now we're going to attack it this way.
Like so many times when a guys would go

1410
01:00:14,471 --> 01:00:18,600
for an arm bar from side control,
you'd be inside control or you be an

1411
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,050
amount.
You had grabbed an arm,

1412
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:23,620
you'd swing over and you'd go and you'd
commit to that arm and then the legs

1413
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,730
would fly over for the DNS,
right?

1414
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,210
Well,
Eddie Bravo was one of the first guys to

1415
01:00:28,211 --> 01:00:28,781
say,
well,

1416
01:00:28,781 --> 01:00:31,870
let's not,
let's not hook it with the right arm

1417
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:32,220
saved.

1418
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,980
You're going for someone's right arm and
you turn a Rmr them.

1419
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,320
Don't Hook it with your right arm.
Hug with the left and grabbed their leg.

1420
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,870
Yeah,
did your other arm and then commit to it

1421
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:45,340
that way because this way you've stopped
the defense and you've got a much more

1422
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:48,910
secure set of a offense and the weight.
One of the reasons why people were going

1423
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:51,400
for it in the first place was because of
the gate.

1424
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,440
Right now.
The keys are really interesting thing

1425
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,940
because I think the GE is very good
defensively and I think defensively it's

1426
01:00:57,941 --> 01:01:01,510
one of the best tools to make sure that
you using proper technique because you

1427
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:04,750
can't just explode out of things.
You have to use the right position.

1428
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:06,640
You have to understand where your day,
where you're in danger,

1429
01:01:06,641 --> 01:01:08,410
when you're not in danger.
However,

1430
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,230
when it comes to attacking the,
gives you so many more,

1431
01:01:11,231 --> 01:01:13,420
handles,
so many more options and I think it's

1432
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:18,310
false security and I think you're way
better off not using it to attack.

1433
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

1434
01:01:19,571 --> 01:01:22,180
I mean that's a whole other part of the
sport too.

1435
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:26,110
It's like you roll with these gay guys
and they're like sneaking this thing out

1436
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,220
and you're like,
oh shit,

1437
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,710
what is he doing?
And now nevermind the fact that that's

1438
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:33,070
going to work.
Just introducing that threat and you're

1439
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:33,701
like,
oh wait,

1440
01:01:33,701 --> 01:01:36,280
what's happening there?
Now my brain isn't mindful where it's

1441
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:37,840
supposed to be.
It's worried about this,

1442
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:40,060
which might be nothing.
He's just pulling a piece of ag.

1443
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,440
It's,
it is fascinating.

1444
01:01:41,441 --> 01:01:45,130
Any kind of combat,
any way that you put two people trying

1445
01:01:45,131 --> 01:01:47,080
to best each other,
it's going to be absolutely

1446
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,120
key.
Guys are doing some weird shit,

1447
01:01:49,121 --> 01:01:50,530
man,
where they're like taking their jacket

1448
01:01:50,531 --> 01:01:52,760
off and wrap it around your head,
strangling you

1449
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:55,800
exact stuff.
We're really going to use this thing if

1450
01:01:55,801 --> 01:01:56,670
we're,
it's going to be in there.

1451
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:00,780
But fighting too.
It's like even how'd you Jitsu is used

1452
01:02:00,781 --> 01:02:04,080
in fighting changes so much in such
interesting ways,

1453
01:02:04,081 --> 01:02:08,070
in ways that we've now seen happen over
and over so many times that you can

1454
01:02:08,071 --> 01:02:10,110
predict their future again.
Like,

1455
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,243
you know,
um,

1456
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,890
the,
the one example that I always kind of

1457
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:15,780
used is,
you know,

1458
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:19,920
I'm in your guard,
so I do a can opener and then your guard

1459
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:20,670
opens,
right?

1460
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:21,900
And then you discover,
hey,

1461
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:24,630
wait a second alarm bar that and you'll
armbar me.

1462
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:26,460
So I mean,
your guard can open,

1463
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:27,720
opens your guard.
Wait a second,

1464
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:29,910
you armbar me.
No more can openers.

1465
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:33,210
That doesn't make any fucking sense.
Danaher later it goes,

1466
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,250
George,
we're going to Kent.

1467
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,630
Open a conduit of,
but the dental her,

1468
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:38,190
what?
I don't do a good French accent,

1469
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:43,740
but what about the arm bar we're going
to can open him and shut down the arm

1470
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:43,950
bar.

1471
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:46,170
We don't stop cat opening cause there's
an orb are there.

1472
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,500
We just solve the problem and that kind
of adjustment.

1473
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:53,880
You see it now in the guard.
Like it blows my mind that in Jim's

1474
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:57,120
every west very smart coaches,
they're like the guard is dead.

1475
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:59,820
We don't submit from the guard anymore.
We use the guard.

1476
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:03,030
What's Brian?
Oh fuck there's lots of good guys or

1477
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:08,031
tell you as a monster jam Jesus Christ.
But think of the implications of that.

1478
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:12,240
This is,
this is where I see the crazy aspect of

1479
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:13,710
it because we've seen this a million
times.

1480
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,040
So all right guys,
we're not going to submit from God are

1481
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:20,130
our use when we are in guard,
we're going to use it to get an under

1482
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:23,550
hook threatened one of these three
things and Heisler hips back out.

1483
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:26,130
And we're going to stand up.
We're going to work on our standup more

1484
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,060
for here.

1485
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,800
We're going to get back up.
Okay coach,

1486
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:31,740
that's great.
So now for the next year and a half,

1487
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,920
your job on top of me becomes hold me
down,

1488
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:39,720
stop my stand up and hit me at my job
becomes fight you to get back up.

1489
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:41,580
That happens for three months,
six months,

1490
01:03:41,581 --> 01:03:43,740
two years.
That becomes the game.

1491
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:47,130
You hold me down and beat me up and I
tried to get back to my feet.

1492
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,950
Your game on top hasn't even involved
the real threat of submissions for two

1493
01:03:52,951 --> 01:03:56,010
fucking years because all your training
partners had just standing up.

1494
01:03:56,250 --> 01:04:01,080
So your getting weaker at stealing with
submission threats cause you never see

1495
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:02,670
them anymore.
Your trading partners don't do them

1496
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:06,570
somewhere in Andy's Jim,
you got Ben Saunders and guys,

1497
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:09,150
they're working on it.
Not only are they getting better at it,

1498
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,790
you're getting worse at it.
As time goes on,

1499
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:12,750
you're getting worse at it.

1500
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,960
Inevitably all of a sudden it's like the
guards back in play.

1501
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:17,820
Holy Shit.
Everybody submit and guys off their

1502
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:19,410
back.
Why he got better,

1503
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,650
but you got worse.
The mindset of how to train that thing

1504
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:27,540
in the gym every day removed a very real
threat because your training partners

1505
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:30,180
don't even throw it at you anymore.
And that thing changes,

1506
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:30,780
you know?
Yeah.

1507
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:34,000
You see that also with wrestlers that
don't wrestle much anymore because of

1508
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:36,590
working on their striking.
We kind of put the wrestling side and

1509
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,340
then they'd get out rustled and you was
like,

1510
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,280
that's something you've got to stay on
top of.

1511
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,110
You got to keep sharpening it.
Yeah.

1512
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,910
There's just so many different variables
in mma.

1513
01:04:44,911 --> 01:04:47,070
It's one of the reasons why it's such an
amazing sport.

1514
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:49,170
This is,
there's so many different ways to go

1515
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:50,070
about it.
I mean,

1516
01:04:50,071 --> 01:04:53,790
you can just decide to Damien Maia it
close the distance kicked guys,

1517
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:57,180
the ground user superior do you do to
submit guys and you know,

1518
01:04:57,181 --> 01:05:00,600
look like a wizard or you can wonderboy
it where you're just standing.

1519
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,130
I mean poor.
There's an interesting fight,

1520
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,350
right?
Damien Maia and wonderboy,

1521
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:06,960
that is a very fucking interesting.
But if that ever happens,

1522
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:08,190
you know,
uh,

1523
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,960
for um,
uh,

1524
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,200
Ramdane and I has my partner,
you met him at a show.

1525
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:16,110
We commentate a bunch of really old
fights and it's really cool.

1526
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,680
Well that's nice.
All pancreas.

1527
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,910
We just did a couple of conduits,
old fights against,

1528
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,880
I can't remember.
I have a uh,

1529
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,790
issue membering names.
I know.

1530
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:26,700
It's cause I got hit in the head a lot
for real.

1531
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:28,810
Like,
or maybe it was like the drugs.

1532
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,220
No,
four days or heroin.

1533
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,140
Exactly.
Uh,

1534
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:34,000
I literally was thinking of that on the
way down here.

1535
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,540
Um,
but uh,

1536
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:36,850
uh,
old,

1537
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
old fights and you see how different it
was.

1538
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:41,860
Like you can spot the things where
you're like,

1539
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,560
now a guy would not do that or he would
do this.

1540
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:45,550
Right.
It just didn't know.

1541
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:50,790
And that's why I think it's crazy that
fighting is so structured in how it's

1542
01:05:50,861 --> 01:05:52,150
trained now.
It's like,

1543
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,650
let's,
let's put it this way,

1544
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:58,270
2000 in 2030 does fighting look
different than it does today?

1545
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:00,250
Oh yeah.
Then why are we training it?

1546
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:02,490
Like it isn't changing.
Like why,

1547
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:06,940
if we know that it is ever changing,
why are we like digging in deep and

1548
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:08,840
saying we got it all figured out.
Uh,

1549
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,140
you got to train your white tie,
you've got to train and just kind of

1550
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:13,000
resting and gotta because someone will
come along.

1551
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,500
That's what taxis dead,
you know,

1552
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:16,960
that's what hotels did.
They were like hotels.

1553
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:19,240
So this is the way to do it.
I'm going to build bigger hotels,

1554
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:21,000
better hotels.
We'll put pools in them.

1555
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:21,461
We,
you know,

1556
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:22,930
we'll advertise them differently in
somebody.

1557
01:06:22,931 --> 01:06:24,910
It's like people don't want to fucking
hotels.

1558
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:29,910
It's airbnb comes along ruins hotels
that the really ruining ozone,

1559
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:32,980
damaging them at the right place.
Yeah.

1560
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:36,100
I mean people,
tons and tons of people just don't even

1561
01:06:36,101 --> 01:06:39,070
consider it anymore.
And when I was coming down to La for the

1562
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:41,680
weekend,
I was looking at how expensive hotels,

1563
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:44,410
where I was thinking about it.
I don't really want to stay in someone's

1564
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:45,250
house.
I don't know.

1565
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:47,310
Although I have friends who do it all
the time.

1566
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,820
They love it,
cameras and shit,

1567
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:50,170
and they're out to the kitchen.
Beaten off.

1568
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,000
Yeah.
I never thought of that.

1569
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,890
But now that I have,
now that that's in my head

1570
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,870
been caught.
Some,

1571
01:06:54,871 --> 01:06:56,610
uh,
some woman was,

1572
01:06:56,611 --> 01:06:58,980
uh,
she was suing some man because he had

1573
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:03,981
set up like hidden cameras that were on
in this house and man,

1574
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:05,280
what's wrong with us?
You know,

1575
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,200
we want to see somebody naked.
Yeah.

1576
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:09,490
Well the engine,
it's full of naked.

1577
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,890
No,
it doesn't matter.

1578
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:13,170
People want,
they want naughty.

1579
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:13,800
Yeah.
You know,

1580
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,390
they want,
they want to be able to do things

1581
01:07:15,391 --> 01:07:18,030
they're not supposed to do,
I guess.

1582
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,130
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1583
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:22,370
There's something creepy but like spying
on somebody.

1584
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,213
Yeah.
Ooh,

1585
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:24,210
yeah.
I mean,

1586
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:26,550
it is creepy.
You can just go to youporn and watch

1587
01:07:26,551 --> 01:07:28,410
people fuck all day long,
but they don't want to,

1588
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,290
as soon as you think about the fact that
somebody spying on you,

1589
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,260
that feeling that you get proves that
it's creepy.

1590
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:35,520
Oh yeah.
You know what I mean?

1591
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,130
Well,
it's the,

1592
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,040
the know the technology,
it's,

1593
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:42,900
it's never been available before where
someone could remotely watch you in your

1594
01:07:42,901 --> 01:07:44,700
own home.
Like fairly easily.

1595
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,780
Yeah.
He used to be,

1596
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,000
you know,
just 10 20 years ago if they wanted to

1597
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:50,040
do something like that,
they had to like set up some pretty

1598
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:52,290
elaborate equipment.
Now I think he's a little tiny,

1599
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,830
tiny cameras are so small little go pro
or something like that.

1600
01:07:55,831 --> 01:07:58,140
Set it up somewhere.
It can remotely access it.

1601
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:01,350
You have a bunch of different kinds of
cameras they can remotely access share

1602
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:05,170
freaky that each mass outside of the
park.

1603
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:06,030
Yeah.

1604
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:08,910
When you think about any kind of
technology can use it for good,

1605
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,090
you can use it to like a fat things.
You can use it to make things better.

1606
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:16,580
You can use it for bad and I think
there's like a perspective thing.

1607
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:20,060
I think with the way that we look at
things,

1608
01:08:20,061 --> 01:08:21,830
you know,
the way that people look at things,

1609
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,410
it's like the perspective that you take
is everything.

1610
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,690
You know,
like if you look at something,

1611
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,630
you're,
somebody says something to you,

1612
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:33,290
you and you give all this meaning to it
and you assume you know what they mean

1613
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:35,690
and then you get mad.
You don't have to do that.

1614
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:39,920
You can like just assign it no meaning
at all and have whatever response you

1615
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:42,320
want.
That kind of perspective is you come

1616
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:44,360
across a camera and you go,
well wouldn't this be cool?

1617
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:47,390
We can like film guys training and we
can like come up with all these cool

1618
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:49,100
things.
I can do my job different.

1619
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:52,760
Or somebody like naked people without
their permission.

1620
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:53,680
That's where we got it.

1621
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,840
You know?
Well it's just assholes.

1622
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,460
Yeah.
You're always going to have assholes,

1623
01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:58,750
you know?
Uh,

1624
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:03,100
we were talking about like fighting
today versus fighting 30 years from now.

1625
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:05,260
Why don't we train like it's going to be
30 years from now.

1626
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,260
I think one of the problems is we need
to see it be successful.

1627
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:10,690
Like you need to see a guy like
wonderboy fight.

1628
01:09:10,691 --> 01:09:11,441
We go,
oh,

1629
01:09:11,441 --> 01:09:13,960
okay we got to learn some fucking sport
karate.

1630
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,730
We've got to figure out how to do that
blitz.

1631
01:09:15,731 --> 01:09:18,400
We got to figure out how to slide back
and throw those kicks the way they're

1632
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:20,830
doing it.
And I still to this day thing,

1633
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,820
we haven't seen the level of traditional
martial arts techniques that are,

1634
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:29,570
that exist in like a really good
taekwondo match or really good kill

1635
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:32,140
Kachin match.
There are guys in these other sports,

1636
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:35,020
you know,
you've seen some guys like a moon toss

1637
01:09:35,021 --> 01:09:37,930
re who's fighting the EOC,
who's a national champion.

1638
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:40,750
Yeah.
He's a bad motherfucker with his kicks.

1639
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,970
So you seeing him,
but you know,

1640
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:44,710
he,
he's got to learn all that other stuff

1641
01:09:44,711 --> 01:09:46,270
first.
He's got to get me,

1642
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:48,130
had to rather learn all that other stuff
first,

1643
01:09:48,131 --> 01:09:49,660
get better at all these other
techniques.

1644
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,090
And you know,
perhaps there's,

1645
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,360
there's going to be some guys that are
even better and more powerful than him.

1646
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:56,210
You know,
that,

1647
01:09:56,210 --> 01:10:01,210
that these traditional techniques I
think are probably the most underused or

1648
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:05,650
the most underappreciated aspects of,
of mma.

1649
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,020
I mean,
when we saw Anderson Front kick Vitorin

1650
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,710
the face and there was like the first
time we'd ever seen that,

1651
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:14,470
you're like,
this is crazy that the first kick ever

1652
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,260
that they teach you is now the new kick.
Yeah.

1653
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,870
Uh,
I know you had boss on earlier and I

1654
01:10:19,871 --> 01:10:22,870
didn't get to see it.
I love bus and he used to say straight

1655
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:24,220
up,
no jabs,

1656
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,980
jabs in fighting a useless.
Now that was a different era.

1657
01:10:26,981 --> 01:10:28,450
Now he would say something different,
I'm sure.

1658
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,560
But he was the people,
they were products of Erez and then that

1659
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,210
other era,
well we can't front kick.

1660
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,120
Well why not?
Well we will get taken down.

1661
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:39,190
No,
well don't get taken down.

1662
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:43,390
Let's just like that crown opener and
the arm bar if you get taken to or

1663
01:10:43,391 --> 01:10:46,090
whatever the issue was.
But say the issue is getting taken down.

1664
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:47,800
If you get taken down off the front
kick,

1665
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:50,890
it doesn't mean don't front kick it
means front kick and figure out how to

1666
01:10:50,891 --> 01:10:52,150
stop the fact that you're going to get
it.

1667
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:55,570
That's what the guys who are really good
at that front kick.

1668
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:59,010
It's such a danger like Kyle noke when
you went to fight in Australia.

1669
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:00,910
Yeah,
those are some,

1670
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,720
I swear some of these guys,
uh,

1671
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,640
Shane Campbell's fighting I think
Sunday.

1672
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:07,070
Yeah.
And he's got a few finishes with their

1673
01:11:07,071 --> 01:11:09,170
toe stabs.
And I think some of the ones I keep

1674
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:11,000
pointing of this connor doll cause it
looks funny.

1675
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:12,680
Um,
the uh,

1676
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:14,280
I think of the ones that hit Mendez
worth,

1677
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:16,560
we're toast abs and just roll the toes
back and drill them in.

1678
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:20,040
And uh,
so you're saying like roll the toes back

1679
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:23,640
down instead of pulling instead of
pulling it back like with the ball of

1680
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:24,690
your foot,
like taekwondo,

1681
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,810
make him like a fist.
Like we're all them and then they stab

1682
01:11:27,811 --> 01:11:28,940
it into the bottle.
It's void.

1683
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,050
Yeah.
Todd and all tie technique.

1684
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:34,620
Yeah.
If you Google Shane Campbell tow stab,

1685
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:37,590
you'll probably see one that,
one of his fights right before I got in

1686
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:38,540
the UFC,
but lots of,

1687
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:40,350
I bet some of them are doing that now.

1688
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:42,420
The ball of the foot,
we can penetrate pretty deep.

1689
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,600
But when they commit to like literally
drilling it in and it penetrates in and

1690
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:50,490
touches your organs,
the meat they gets to me,

1691
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:53,850
those that I feel like I can kick
through a door with a ball of my foot.

1692
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,850
That's your lifetime toe.
I'm not going to be able to have that

1693
01:11:56,851 --> 01:12:00,600
kind of impact.
Do that toast tab and you hit an elbow,

1694
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,610
you're kind of fucks Ville.
Well,

1695
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:06,210
I guess that's the risk of it.
Like the reason you can do that as you

1696
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:09,390
did it since you were a little kid over
and over thousands and thousands of

1697
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:12,300
times and it is harder and it is safer
and it is smarter.

1698
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,880
But if you know that that spot is there,
I mean,

1699
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,170
all of these things have to be the next
answers.

1700
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:23,280
Cause with the next answer isn't just do
what we're all doing only better.

1701
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,213
Right?
I mean,

1702
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,020
and it was kind of like,
um,

1703
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:28,020
uh,
who was it?

1704
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:28,890
Uh,
uh,

1705
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,210
Matt Hughes,
his coach.

1706
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,440
He was a,
from that pub meal.

1707
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,313
Yeah.
Military,

1708
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,260
military and frank shamrock.
And these guys were like,

1709
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,780
okay,
well you were a wrestler and I was a

1710
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:43,110
striker and that's all these things.
I just got to get really pretty good at

1711
01:12:43,111 --> 01:12:45,660
all those things.
That worked for awhile.

1712
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:49,320
But now that everybody knows every
single choice that you're making,

1713
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:51,120
every single position,
it's,

1714
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,090
we're just playing within these rules
that we've kind of agreed on.

1715
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,760
It's gotta be some other stuff we got.
It's got to be things that you don't

1716
01:12:56,761 --> 01:12:58,260
train.
It's got to be things you haven't dealt

1717
01:12:58,261 --> 01:12:59,460
with.
It's gotta be thinks your training

1718
01:12:59,461 --> 01:13:02,190
partners don't show you.
That has to be the next answer.

1719
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:04,350
It has to always be the next answer.
Yeah.

1720
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,590
I think movement is the big focus right
now,

1721
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,160
right?

1722
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:13,160
With Ido and uh,
with all these are when Irwin Liqour,

1723
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,750
nick curse on focuses a lot on movement,
a lot of plyometrics and explosion

1724
01:13:18,751 --> 01:13:20,190
drills and movements,
rules.

1725
01:13:20,191 --> 01:13:24,720
And I think they're realizing now that w
what's the glue in between the

1726
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:27,510
techniques is what would the really
concentrating on.

1727
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:30,240
I think that was a big factor in the
Johnny Hendricks,

1728
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:32,610
wonderboy Thompson fire for sure.
It was the movement,

1729
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,630
the movement,
the,

1730
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:34,201
and the,
the,

1731
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:37,020
the fact that hendricks is so much more
stationary.

1732
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:40,340
He just really wasn't able to close
those distances or get out of the way.

1733
01:13:40,341 --> 01:13:44,460
It didn't have that kind of footwork.
And his game was just so dependent upon

1734
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:46,320
close range fighting.
Yeah.

1735
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:47,070
He said,
uh,

1736
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:48,960
you know,
I kind of hoped he would trade in the

1737
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:51,210
pocket with me more.
Why the fuck would he do that?

1738
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,000
He shouldn't say that.
He should definitely not do that.

1739
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:57,150
I feel like I just said,
I kind of hoped he would fall down.

1740
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,280
Yeah.
I um,

1741
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,370
I feel like I know why Mcgregor,
I started doing that,

1742
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,410
that movement training.
I could be wrong.

1743
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,240
I'm going to hopefully get the chance to
ask him.

1744
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,330
But you remember the last time that I
was here,

1745
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:11,380
we talked about that flow state.
You know,

1746
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:15,640
when you achieve that flow state,
the best guys are fighting that a

1747
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,890
hundred hundred percent right.
And there that state of freedom,

1748
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:20,440
right.
And condit was one of the first guys I

1749
01:14:20,441 --> 01:14:24,250
really spotted that Kinda did that
earlier before we chat about last time.

1750
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:27,310
And um,
so you're seeing that a lot when you're

1751
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:30,460
in a true flow state,
you are free,

1752
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:33,550
innovative,
able to do things you weren't aware of,

1753
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:36,190
fully present in the moment.
There's all of these things.

1754
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:41,280
It's about sort of true freedom.
I think he believed that his body,

1755
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,900
he was his mind and it the thing has
goals were freer than his body was

1756
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:50,260
allowing him to be,
that if he was truly mentally free to

1757
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:53,890
fight that the,
the thing that was stopping him was his

1758
01:14:53,891 --> 01:14:58,000
physical movement limitations and I
really believe that's why he went and

1759
01:14:58,001 --> 01:15:00,550
pursued that kind of open movement
because we're not going to become any

1760
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:02,650
freer than in a peak performance state.

1761
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,860
So we have to free up our body if we're
going to go further with this.

1762
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,780
Well,
it makes sense if you look at what

1763
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:08,770
people,
well George,

1764
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:11,170
Saint Pierre,
you know a lot of ways was ahead of the

1765
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:13,810
curve with this because of his
gymnastics approach,

1766
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:17,260
but really the originator of the shit is
is Hixon.

1767
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:21,610
If you go back and watch Hixon when
Hickson was into the movement was

1768
01:15:21,611 --> 01:15:23,020
gymnastic,
unnatural Gal.

1769
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,630
He was in a lot of like crazy yoga
things,

1770
01:15:25,631 --> 01:15:29,350
a lot of flexibility and balance things.
He was into that way,

1771
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:30,540
way before anybody right

1772
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:34,940
was and personally was into building the
body to do martial arts too.

1773
01:15:34,941 --> 01:15:38,710
In whatever ways you can figure it out.
You were just saying it half an hour

1774
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:39,620
ago.
I don't know how long it's been,

1775
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,030
uh,
that,

1776
01:15:41,031 --> 01:15:42,830
uh,
you tell Jujitsu guys,

1777
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:47,210
you got to get strong.
You identified that and identified that

1778
01:15:47,211 --> 01:15:48,500
all that long ago.
He's like,

1779
01:15:48,501 --> 01:15:50,390
okay,
we figured out how we're going to move

1780
01:15:50,391 --> 01:15:51,260
it.
Now what do I,

1781
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,230
what can I do with my body to enhance
that or take that further?

1782
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,840
Eddie with his flexibility's yes.

1783
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:57,980
Well,
it Hickson was always the best out of

1784
01:15:57,981 --> 01:15:59,040
all of the gracies.
He's,

1785
01:15:59,041 --> 01:16:01,640
he's widely regarded as the greatest
jujitsu artist ever.

1786
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:04,730
So if you look at Hixson in comparison
to all the other ones,

1787
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:05,960
like hoist,
when he was fighting,

1788
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:10,430
what was so impressive about hoists was
that he wasn't a specimen and he was

1789
01:16:10,431 --> 01:16:12,860
just a regular guy who was in shape
obviously,

1790
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:15,650
but had really good technique would
hixon is,

1791
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,890
is that really good technique with a
freak athletic body,

1792
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:19,521
right?
You know,

1793
01:16:19,521 --> 01:16:23,060
a guy who can stand on a balance beam
and do a full split holding onto his

1794
01:16:23,061 --> 01:16:24,440
heel.
I mean he's,

1795
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:27,200
he's really freakish in his ability to
move his body.

1796
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:31,340
And physical strength was a huge factor
in his ability as well.

1797
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:35,210
So if you look at Hixson in the old days
in comparison to the other guys,

1798
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:38,990
you're seeing a much more physically
robust guy,

1799
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:41,480
much stronger.
And because of that,

1800
01:16:41,481 --> 01:16:44,360
he was able to overcome.
Like if you get two guys,

1801
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:47,090
they both have equal technique,
but one guy is much stronger,

1802
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:50,000
that guy's gonna dominate.
And that's just the way it is.

1803
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:52,010
You know,
technique is hugely important.

1804
01:16:52,011 --> 01:16:55,280
It's probably the most important thing.
But once that's covered,

1805
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:58,400
physical strength is a huge attribute.
Huge.

1806
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:01,260
Then the physical strength becomes equal
now.

1807
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:04,020
So then flag warning,
then it becomes flexibility and

1808
01:17:04,021 --> 01:17:05,340
movement.
Anyone that's equal,

1809
01:17:05,341 --> 01:17:07,420
it's just our minds like who's gun?

1810
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:09,000
More creative,
more creative.

1811
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,480
Who's more in the zone,
who's more loose,

1812
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,160
who can pull the trigger?
Easier.

1813
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:15,950
Psychological training.
It's a huge factor.

1814
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:19,070
Huge.
A lot of guys are getting into hypnosis

1815
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:19,700
now.
Yeah.

1816
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,230
You know,
I got hypnotized.

1817
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,030
Vinny shoreman hypnotize.
Wow.

1818
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:23,961
Yeah,
yeah.

1819
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:27,590
Here I wanted to see what it was like.
He came and did the podcast and he was

1820
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:28,580
a,
he'd been training,

1821
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,090
he's trained a bunch of guys.
He's GE works with Joe Schilling and a

1822
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:32,930
bunch of different,
uh,

1823
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,290
kickboxers and Moy Thai guys.
And I just want to know what it was all

1824
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:38,230
about and what was it like?
Legit,

1825
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,380
man,
it's legit.

1826
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:40,280
You know,
I was like,

1827
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:40,791
okay,
what is,

1828
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:43,250
what is hypnosis is trying to fight it?
No,

1829
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:43,791
no,
no.

1830
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:44,840
I,
I didn't want to do that.

1831
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:47,060
I wanted to just,
I want him to him to hypnotize me.

1832
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:47,840
See what it's like.

1833
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,680
You definitely go into a state.
You'd definitely go into some strange

1834
01:17:51,681 --> 01:17:55,370
state of consciousness.
I wouldn't say you're asleep because a,

1835
01:17:55,371 --> 01:17:57,170
I was,
I heard him talking,

1836
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,101
you know,
I remember,

1837
01:17:58,101 --> 01:18:01,640
I remember hearing Vinnie's voice,
but I was most certainly hypnotized.

1838
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,170
Wow.
I was definitely there,

1839
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,700
you know?
And um,

1840
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:07,070
it's like,
like you're going into like a,

1841
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:11,270
almost like a drug induced.
It feels real weird.

1842
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:15,390
That's what I felt like for four days.
I don't think it's that quite that bad,

1843
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:16,490
but,
uh,

1844
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:18,080
it's,
it's a very,

1845
01:18:18,081 --> 01:18:20,120
it's a very strange state.
It's,

1846
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:20,810
it's,
it's,

1847
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:24,110
it's very difficult to describe it and
compare it to something else because I

1848
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:28,310
don't think I've ever experienced
anything like it other than maybe a

1849
01:18:28,311 --> 01:18:32,240
state that you get into sometimes when
you're doing like a sensory deprivation

1850
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:35,090
tank or I guess you would do if you were
doing like heavy meditation,

1851
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:39,500
you get into some weird alternative
state of consciousness.

1852
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:40,310
Wow.
Yeah.

1853
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,040
Wow.

1854
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,080
A lot of guys do.
I'm visualizing training,

1855
01:18:44,081 --> 01:18:45,130
but with,
uh,

1856
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:46,173
with,
uh,

1857
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:49,150
I don't know if there's a lot of the
coaches wouldn't call themselves a

1858
01:18:49,151 --> 01:18:50,620
hypnotist,
but they lead it.

1859
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,740
So they lead you through it.
You've got your eyes closed and David,

1860
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,310
uh,
uh,

1861
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:57,400
does it with some of the spg guys and
other people and he says,

1862
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:59,500
you apps,
as you're getting them to go through and

1863
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,060
visualize it,
you see them moving,

1864
01:19:01,061 --> 01:19:05,350
you see them sweating like you,
they are experiencing the fight in their

1865
01:19:05,351 --> 01:19:07,660
mind.
They are visualizing everything and it's

1866
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:11,830
probably very similar and uh,
but you lead you through it and at the

1867
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:14,170
end they feel tired.
They feel mentally tire.

1868
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,000
They feel they've,
they've done it.

1869
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:19,660
And that that idea that you visualize,
I mean if we do something,

1870
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:23,530
our brain is doing it right.
So if we don't physically do it,

1871
01:19:23,531 --> 01:19:26,770
but our brain does it,
you definitely get huge real true value

1872
01:19:26,771 --> 01:19:27,100
from it.

1873
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,470
Well it's been proven,
it's been proven that people can improve

1874
01:19:29,471 --> 01:19:33,760
as much through visualization as they
can from actual physical movement is as

1875
01:19:33,761 --> 01:19:36,190
long as you actually commit to it and
you know,

1876
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:39,840
don't be all fucking weird and like half
it and you know,

1877
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:43,270
you have to think of it as if you're
doing it and if you can think of it as

1878
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:46,120
if you're doing it,
your mind will take those same pathways.

1879
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,420
I know that guys have learned new
Jujitsu techniques that way.

1880
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,060
Like you,
you visualize yourself pulling them off

1881
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,730
and then when you're training they just,
they just come.

1882
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,600
They just come to you.

1883
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,100
Yeah.
That just shows you what your brain can

1884
01:19:58,101 --> 01:19:59,840
do it.
Why it is the most important part.

1885
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:01,640
I mean,
by the time we've learned how to do

1886
01:20:01,641 --> 01:20:04,430
everything,
we're going to fight and you're walking

1887
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:07,340
down there and if you haven't prepared
mentally,

1888
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:11,010
everything else was always to time.
If you can't go in there and be at an

1889
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,340
optimum state free of the worrying about
the consequences.

1890
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:16,110
Oh Man,
I'm going to like how much would I need

1891
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,120
my wind bonus or what if I lose this
fight or,

1892
01:20:18,121 --> 01:20:22,410
and you can't have any of that.
You have to be like truly free to

1893
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:26,440
perform and guys will spend years
trainings,

1894
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:29,820
the physicality and the technical stuff
and then not have a plan for that.

1895
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,070
When Cruz said that,
um,

1896
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,690
you know,
ring roster,

1897
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:37,260
octagon shock or whatever is yeah,
Russ is not real.

1898
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:40,440
I 100% believe that I hundred percent
agree with them.

1899
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,110
It's real.
If you think it's real,

1900
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,780
it's not real.
If it's not real to you.

1901
01:20:45,781 --> 01:20:48,120
And,
but the way it became not real to him is

1902
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:49,770
he prepared for it.
You know,

1903
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:52,050
this is the second time I'm in this
room.

1904
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:54,420
I'm more comfortable in it than I was
last time.

1905
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:57,540
Um,
Jamie and you are way more comfortable

1906
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:59,700
than Brendan job who is more comfortable
than me.

1907
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:02,920
Do you know what I do?
Because it's the environment and uh,

1908
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:05,490
Bj Penn used to go and train for a fight
and he'd have,

1909
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:06,420
um,
a,

1910
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:09,480
uh,
a rough and a fake ring announcer and an

1911
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:13,560
audience and the walkout and he would
create all of that before he fought.

1912
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,640
So that hue,
that stuff wasn't new because the first

1913
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:20,400
fucking time you're standing in there
and bruce buffer is doing that crazy

1914
01:21:20,401 --> 01:21:23,280
shit at you.
If you haven't prepared for that,

1915
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:27,000
all the next thing you know,
you either wake up or you somehow won,

1916
01:21:27,001 --> 01:21:29,910
but you really don't remember anything
like that.

1917
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,390
You're looking at them.
It's like you,

1918
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,810
that can't be the first time that you've
looked at Bruce Babbitt,

1919
01:21:33,811 --> 01:21:35,850
but it has to have been in your mind 30
times.

1920
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:36,684
It's like,
right,

1921
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,570
this is where I belong.
I'm supposed to be here.

1922
01:21:39,571 --> 01:21:41,580
I belong here.
I earned my way here.

1923
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:43,770
Fucking right.
Bruce buffers introducing me because the

1924
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:45,450
whole world's going to see how fucking
good I am.

1925
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:47,460
You can't be like,
oh shit.

1926
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:50,660
When you see the UFC does jogging over
there,

1927
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,550
it's like,
yeah you can't,

1928
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:56,430
that can't be new.
That has to have happened dozens or

1929
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:57,900
hundreds of times in your mind when you
go in there.

1930
01:21:58,050 --> 01:21:59,430
It's interesting because a lot of these
guys,

1931
01:21:59,431 --> 01:22:03,150
their member mental preparation is just
doing it and learning once you've done

1932
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:07,350
it instead of preparing for it and then
once you're actually doing it,

1933
01:22:07,351 --> 01:22:09,330
you go,
this is what I've prepared for for sure.

1934
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:12,030
Uh,
and even just all the way along,

1935
01:22:12,031 --> 01:22:15,750
like if there are,
we all should learn stuff like that.

1936
01:22:15,751 --> 01:22:19,080
That's what I say all the time.
Sometimes I'll like use an example of

1937
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:23,010
something that I do or my friend does or
whatever and I don't mean to put it back

1938
01:22:23,011 --> 01:22:24,930
to myself,
I'm saying we should all try to do this.

1939
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:28,120
You look and you prepare for stuff and
you,

1940
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,320
you go back and it's the work,
the work that you did.

1941
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,390
That's what matters.
You're not any,

1942
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:36,630
you're just a guy,
but you're a guy who worked like crazy,

1943
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:37,650
prepared,
like crazy,

1944
01:22:37,651 --> 01:22:41,490
made notes of the things that you did.
When you can go back and look at your

1945
01:22:41,491 --> 01:22:45,660
journal or your notes and see everything
you've done in the day or afternoon of

1946
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:48,810
that fight,
that stuff is fighting that all of your

1947
01:22:48,811 --> 01:22:51,030
work is fighting you all.
You got to go in,

1948
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:52,140
go in there and have fun.

1949
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,580
The work's been done.
That's the state you have to be in.

1950
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:57,630
And the reason I mentioned,
I have a stack of every breakdown I've

1951
01:22:57,631 --> 01:22:58,710
ever done,
all the work,

1952
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,840
every note,
and it's like this high.

1953
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,320
And I bring that with me.
When I went to meet Dana and Craig,

1954
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:07,630
I had in my suitcase when I went down to
meet them and Vegas,

1955
01:23:07,631 --> 01:23:08,680
cause I look at that,
it's like,

1956
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,210
right,
I'm supposed to be here.

1957
01:23:10,211 --> 01:23:11,950
I'm really,
I worked really hard on this stuff.

1958
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,720
I'm supposed to be talking to these
guys.

1959
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,660
This is where I'm supposed to be.
If I don't have that,

1960
01:23:16,661 --> 01:23:17,560
you can be like,
well what,

1961
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:18,290
uh,
what,

1962
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:19,150
what should I,
what do I,

1963
01:23:19,151 --> 01:23:20,370
you know,
you can't be crushing.

1964
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:23,830
You'd have to look at all the work that
you did and on that walk to the cage,

1965
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:26,440
I had terrible performances and I want
are two good ones.

1966
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:30,640
And the best one was the last one cause
I understood what state you were

1967
01:23:30,641 --> 01:23:32,620
supposed to be in.
You couldn't be scared.

1968
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:34,810
He couldn't be angry.
He couldn't be out to get them.

1969
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,110
You had to be fucking free.
You'll love martial arts.

1970
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:40,270
You love fighting.
This is what you wanted to do.

1971
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:42,760
You don't have to be here.
You get to be here.

1972
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,860
That's,
that's the state you have to be in

1973
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:49,390
when you do a breakdown.
So if you do a breakdown for conor

1974
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:52,810
mcgregor and Hoffeld dos Anjos,
how do you begin?

1975
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,010
What do you,
what do you do?

1976
01:23:54,011 --> 01:23:57,100
Do you watch footage?
Do you think about what you already

1977
01:23:57,101 --> 01:23:59,230
know?
How do you,

1978
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:04,231
how do you begin to break down?
So I got to know what my point is.

1979
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,160
And the point is,
like I said,

1980
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:11,390
to influence the way people watch,
fighting in a way that's positive and

1981
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:16,360
make them learn stuff and you'll hope it
influences other people who influence

1982
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:20,410
stuff because you want people to take,
you want to inject these ideas into the

1983
01:24:20,411 --> 01:24:20,650
world.

1984
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:23,680
So that has to be where you start.
If you start from that point,

1985
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:28,510
it's not too I got to earn money or I
got to like get clicks and nothing.

1986
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:31,960
You,
I want people to see how fucking amazing

1987
01:24:31,961 --> 01:24:33,490
this is.
So you start from that point.

1988
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:39,150
That point could be months in advance.
Then there's things that you've been

1989
01:24:39,911 --> 01:24:43,930
watching and studying and looking at and
full immersion things like you know,

1990
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,820
this movement stuff that we're talking
about or,

1991
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:49,800
or comparisons that you make of how
people work against the cage and compare

1992
01:24:49,801 --> 01:24:52,530
it to another sport or all these ideas
are all floating around you.

1993
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,010
Hopefully you've got 50 of them and then
the fight comes up and you see,

1994
01:24:57,011 --> 01:24:59,660
oh fuck,
it's conor mcgregor and half fail dos

1995
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:03,550
Anjos so that's got to start brewing.
I know I asked Craig the accepted mine

1996
01:25:03,551 --> 01:25:04,630
tonight.
So the next one is,

1997
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,140
is Jones and cormier.

1998
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:09,250
I'm on that already.
What's going on in that fight?

1999
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,380
Okay,
what do I look back at their other

2000
01:25:11,381 --> 01:25:14,290
fight?
Do I look at at how they do what at,

2001
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,090
what is happening,
what happened,

2002
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,520
what's going to happen,
how's it going to happen?

2003
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:22,690
And where's the fucking cool in it?
So that starts immediately and then you

2004
01:25:22,691 --> 01:25:24,220
go,
you might have a couple of ideas,

2005
01:25:24,221 --> 01:25:26,230
you might have some,
oh well you know range man.

2006
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,660
Like there's,
there's this four ranges kind of thing

2007
01:25:28,661 --> 01:25:30,880
I've been playing around with and I did
it in the,

2008
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:34,060
Ronda won,
but they didn't release it as that w

2009
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:37,840
that version.
So I was sure applies to Jon Jones.

2010
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:40,540
So it'll start,
I'll start thinking about it in terms of

2011
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:43,660
four different ranges and how he managed
the edit your versions.

2012
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,800
No,
I send in multi.

2013
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:48,910
I sent in multiple versions for that one
only because they were like,

2014
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:52,150
they didn't know what I did or how I did
it or how I work with them or whatever.

2015
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:55,020
Actually it's been super cool.
Like I send it in,

2016
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:55,541
they're like,
wow,

2017
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:56,620
it's great.
And put it out.

2018
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,360
But the first one,
Dana was like,

2019
01:25:58,361 --> 01:26:00,290
well,
can you give me like four minute version

2020
01:26:00,291 --> 01:26:03,830
and a five minute version of one minute?
I just want to for him to wrap his head

2021
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:06,350
around it.
So the first one that I sent in was many

2022
01:26:06,351 --> 01:26:11,300
different ones and then since then,
and they've been fucking super cool.

2023
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,230
They're just like,
Hey,

2024
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:13,460
I think this guy's good at this.
Yeah,

2025
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:16,250
I couldn't go do that thing you do,
which is exactly what you hope.

2026
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:17,170
Right.
You know?

2027
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,910
So,
but that one now you sent them multiple

2028
01:26:19,911 --> 01:26:22,640
and it was mostly just so they could get
a wrap their head around it.

2029
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,080
Also,
you're,

2030
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:26,870
I mean,
you're working in a company,

2031
01:26:26,871 --> 01:26:29,390
they got to figure out who is this guy?
You know,

2032
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:32,000
he talks fast and it seems enthusiastic
as he smart,

2033
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:33,020
as easy to work with.

2034
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,610
How does it take direction?
You know?

2035
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:36,080
So you've got to figure all that stuff
out.

2036
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,760
But I think they figured out pretty
quick.

2037
01:26:37,761 --> 01:26:38,540
He's like,
Oh yeah,

2038
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,430
he just likes doing this stuff.
And he does a good job.

2039
01:26:40,431 --> 01:26:43,100
And so it's very,
very committed to it.

2040
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:47,150
If you were smart and you were running a
business and obviously the UFC is very

2041
01:26:47,151 --> 01:26:48,740
smart,
they look at a garlic you with,

2042
01:26:48,741 --> 01:26:50,060
he goes,
just tell him to do it.

2043
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:50,990
He's,
he's going to do it.

2044
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,310
He likes you to do it,
right.

2045
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,110
Yeah.
That's been,

2046
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:55,850
that's how it's been.
You're much direction.

2047
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:56,421
Yeah,
that's,

2048
01:26:56,421 --> 01:26:57,540
that's how it's been.
Um,

2049
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,540
and uh,
but in that one,

2050
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:01,610
so yeah.
So I'll look at it and now I've got

2051
01:27:01,611 --> 01:27:04,490
like,
that fight is not for eight weeks,

2052
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,610
so I'll still do other breakdowns and
fighting.

2053
01:27:06,611 --> 01:27:08,270
I work in the meantime I'd with,
you know,

2054
01:27:08,271 --> 01:27:10,260
that's,
there are a family,

2055
01:27:10,261 --> 01:27:13,520
I,
I do 40 hours a week of TV there and I

2056
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:15,740
built these around,
really do 40 hours,

2057
01:27:15,741 --> 01:27:18,680
least of ours,
not have hours of TV,

2058
01:27:18,681 --> 01:27:20,540
but I'm in there five days a week.

2059
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,810
We're a 24 hour fight channel,
so there's six.

2060
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:24,920
I don't want an American.
Uh,

2061
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:28,880
it's on like xbox and like all those
other things,

2062
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:33,020
those like Roku and I'm,
all of that kind of stuff.

2063
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,870
And then it's in the tristate area and
it's in Texas.

2064
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:38,180
I could sit and it has,
it doesn't have national carriage,

2065
01:27:38,181 --> 01:27:41,870
but it's got pockets of carriage and
like a no brainer.

2066
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:43,910
Yeah.
As a channel that just had fights on all

2067
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:46,580
the time when people would just go like
how many times you've been flipping

2068
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:48,150
through the channel,
bored looking for something,

2069
01:27:48,151 --> 01:27:50,690
then you go to wall,
always go find some on the fight.

2070
01:27:50,691 --> 01:27:51,560
Jail.
Yeah.

2071
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:54,800
And uh,
I mean in Canada the timing was pretty

2072
01:27:54,801 --> 01:27:57,320
good because George was a big star right
now in Ireland,

2073
01:27:57,321 --> 01:27:59,210
fighting is the thing.
And,

2074
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:02,780
and Canada was like that and that
allowed us to kind of get entrenched in

2075
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:03,170
there.

2076
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:04,760
But when all day,
every day is fighting,

2077
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:09,740
literally it's like there are times,
Hey Robin and John and John Go and talk

2078
01:28:09,741 --> 01:28:10,550
about,
you know,

2079
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:13,550
this news.
So I'll do on a Monday we'll do five

2080
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:15,110
rounds,
which was an analysis show.

2081
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:18,740
We'll do two or more chats of what's
going on in the news.

2082
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,890
I'll do five rounds today,
which is a podcast version,

2083
01:28:21,891 --> 01:28:25,160
but it's for television.
And then on Tuesday we'll do similar

2084
01:28:25,161 --> 01:28:28,880
stuff and then call two hours of all the
vintage pancreas.

2085
01:28:28,881 --> 01:28:32,360
And then the next day called two hours
of deep on a Japan,

2086
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,070
so all day,
all the time.

2087
01:28:34,071 --> 01:28:36,890
So for me,
this is a fucking amazing thing,

2088
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:38,930
right?
Because this is my life's work.

2089
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:43,040
It's my job and passion and obsession
and,

2090
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:43,990
uh,
that's,

2091
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,990
I get to do it all day,
but I do that and I'm now making these

2092
01:28:47,991 --> 01:28:50,300
breakdowns.
So they have to happen around that.

2093
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:54,680
But all day long you've got to be ready.
It's something hits you or you pick up

2094
01:28:54,681 --> 01:28:57,470
on something or there's a sea change or
there's some kind of little movement

2095
01:28:57,471 --> 01:28:59,120
going on in something,
well,

2096
01:28:59,121 --> 01:29:02,130
I got to break down in six weeks.
Maybe I can explore that for that.

2097
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,430
Then you get excited.
You know,

2098
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,500
the conor won.
I was,

2099
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:10,790
I'm very interested in this guy and I
look at these guys,

2100
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:13,110
you know,
Chris Weidman's work ethic that taught

2101
01:29:13,111 --> 01:29:14,220
me how to work really hard.
You know,

2102
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:15,570
I,
I was kind of worked hard,

2103
01:29:15,571 --> 01:29:16,770
but you look at this guy,
okay,

2104
01:29:16,771 --> 01:29:18,720
that's how,
that's how it's winners work.

2105
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,060
And then,
um,

2106
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:21,630
Mcgregor's growth mentality.
It's like,

2107
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:23,160
okay,
that's how I'm going to get better and

2108
01:29:23,161 --> 01:29:25,800
better and better and he's innovating.
I got to innovate.

2109
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:29,850
If I innovate,
you want other people to spread the

2110
01:29:29,851 --> 01:29:32,340
idea.
I want people to rip my stuff off cause

2111
01:29:32,341 --> 01:29:37,341
then they'll rip off what I did a year
ago and then a year from now I'll do new

2112
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:37,860
stuff.

2113
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:41,310
Like you want it all to influence how
people see fighting because I think

2114
01:29:41,311 --> 01:29:43,920
fighting is the coolest thing and if
they see it through my eyes,

2115
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,710
they'll think that too.
You know?

2116
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,100
But you want it,
you know?

2117
01:29:47,101 --> 01:29:48,030
So you get,
you caught,

2118
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:52,170
you learn about innovating from him.
You look at what Ron does going through

2119
01:29:52,171 --> 01:29:54,480
and you learn how to,
how do people deal with that?

2120
01:29:54,481 --> 01:29:56,360
How would I deal with that?
And then just get,

2121
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,180
I'm super attached to all of these
people in these things and these

2122
01:30:00,181 --> 01:30:03,750
experiences and I kind of get to live
them out and learn from them.

2123
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:07,370
You know?
When you look at conor and Hoffeld no

2124
01:30:07,371 --> 01:30:09,180
song Jules,
how are you?

2125
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:14,160
How do you think that is going down you,
there's obviously a bunch of different

2126
01:30:14,161 --> 01:30:17,850
ways they can interact with each other.
Once the cage door shuts and the fight

2127
01:30:17,851 --> 01:30:19,320
begins,
how do you,

2128
01:30:19,321 --> 01:30:20,160
how do you perceive it?

2129
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:24,930
Well
I go through fighting gets more and more

2130
01:30:24,931 --> 01:30:28,080
and more complicated and then you go
through these periods where it gets

2131
01:30:28,081 --> 01:30:30,480
really,
really simple and then it gets more and

2132
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:32,690
more complicated.
And that's kind of the process of my

2133
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:34,770
learning.
And right now I'm looking at it kind of

2134
01:30:34,771 --> 01:30:37,620
simply.
Obviously connor wants to get,

2135
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,720
connor has the left hand that knocks
people out.

2136
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:44,580
So almost everything he kind of built
was to put himself in a situation is to

2137
01:30:44,581 --> 01:30:46,530
hit guys with his left hand and knock
them unconscious.

2138
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:49,170
So that's our job.
We need to knock you unconscious with

2139
01:30:49,171 --> 01:30:51,240
this.
So what are some of the problems that

2140
01:30:51,241 --> 01:30:52,790
could prevent that from happening?
Well,

2141
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,440
you can get ahold of me,
you can push me up against the cage,

2142
01:30:55,441 --> 01:30:58,200
you can do all these things.
And what are the ways that I could

2143
01:30:58,201 --> 01:30:59,760
increase the likelihood of doing that?

2144
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,530
Well,
I can fuck with you.

2145
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:04,440
That seems to help works for everybody
who's good at it.

2146
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,470
But ultimately if dos Anjos puts him on
his back,

2147
01:31:07,471 --> 01:31:10,380
he's in real fucking trouble.
It's in real fucking trouble.

2148
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:13,860
I agree.
This is not kind of a pretty good

2149
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:16,830
Jujitsu guy.
This is not kind of this a vicious

2150
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:20,730
violent guy who will happily stay on
your guard till caves your face and

2151
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,190
until you overreact and then he'll start
passing.

2152
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,980
Then he'll start abusing.
You're in trouble.

2153
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:29,130
So,
but at the same time we can't look at it

2154
01:31:29,131 --> 01:31:31,290
and go,
I must stay off the ground at all costs

2155
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,840
because that infringes on connors being
connor.

2156
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:36,600
So he has to play the game of Stephen
Thompson played.

2157
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,540
That has to be,
that's the game most of these guys are

2158
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:42,570
looking to try to do right now.
Thing about dos Anjos though,

2159
01:31:42,571 --> 01:31:45,930
he's very fast and he's very good at
closing the distance.

2160
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:47,730
You know,
I was really shocked and the Pettis

2161
01:31:47,731 --> 01:31:51,930
fight how quickly he pulled the trigger
and how he leaves no space.

2162
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:56,340
He leaves no space for you to analyze
his movement and prepare to counter.

2163
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:59,230
He's on you before you could get that
breathing right.

2164
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,250
The pedes one is definitely,
this was one of the ways I was going to

2165
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:04,900
break it down,
so when you're looking at it,

2166
01:32:04,901 --> 01:32:08,920
there starts to be multiple different
ways because no thing is one thing is 50

2167
01:32:08,921 --> 01:32:11,800
things.
One of them was dos Anjos might be

2168
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:16,801
looking at this as this is similar to
the pettis fight and so what?

2169
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,530
What would you do different if you were
connor,

2170
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:21,640
if your goal,
if your job was to beat this guy,

2171
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:27,360
pedis didn't move laterally very much
because he's also really good at the

2172
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:29,680
end.
Him and Duke and lots of people I've

2173
01:32:29,681 --> 01:32:32,620
been working on.
As you back up delivering with power

2174
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:35,230
right back up,
a lot of it has to do with the stomp of

2175
01:32:35,231 --> 01:32:36,310
the back foot.
Bam.

2176
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,410
You know,
and so they were working on that.

2177
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:41,080
This guy is a pressure fighter.
As he moves forward,

2178
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:41,914
we're going to rip them.

2179
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,390
We're going to hurt them,
we're going to drop him.

2180
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,890
We're going to discourage them.
Just never,

2181
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,940
never got it off somewhere.
Now my orbital bone is broken.

2182
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:53,950
My idea of lulling you in and hurting
you bad isn't working dog.

2183
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:56,920
The the adjustment is we got to start
moving laterally.

2184
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:59,800
He never really orbital in the first
round.

2185
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:02,020
First Punch that hard left hand.
Yeah.

2186
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:02,943
Wow.
Yep.

2187
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:06,790
Now the one,
so then we're looking at it where connor

2188
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:10,060
and his people and they're taking a
positive approach to it.

2189
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:11,380
What,
what can we exploit?

2190
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:15,430
One thing does hang us,
does all really the only thing that he,

2191
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,600
if you're looking at it and going,
what,

2192
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:21,280
what one thing jumps out as less than
perfect for this killer champion and

2193
01:33:21,281 --> 01:33:23,590
that he,
he really telegraphs his punches.

2194
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:26,020
He telegraphs them a lot.
You see it,

2195
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:26,920
right?
You see,

2196
01:33:26,921 --> 01:33:30,040
and when I break things down,
I'll watch fights in slow motion

2197
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:34,000
sometimes dozens of times and now our
agile all I see,

2198
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,960
did you see the video that somebody put
together?

2199
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:40,990
It's like an animated Gif file of a Aldo
chasing after connor connor landing the

2200
01:33:42,171 --> 01:33:45,500
left hand.
And then the same exact movement by dos

2201
01:33:45,501 --> 01:33:49,220
Anjos chasing after pedis but,
or chasing after Donald Rather.

2202
01:33:49,221 --> 01:33:54,221
But Donald Donald doesn't land the punch
like you see very similar movement.

2203
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:55,630
He sees.

2204
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,780
That's what he says he sees.
Now when I look at him,

2205
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,880
I,
he does and I,

2206
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:05,920
I'm a,
I actually hate to criticize it anyway.

2207
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:09,730
I don't feel comfortable with,
I don't feel qualified to criticize.

2208
01:34:09,731 --> 01:34:10,840
And I,
that's just a personal thing.

2209
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:12,700
I don't think other people shouldn't.
I just,

2210
01:34:12,701 --> 01:34:17,701
I'm looking at 90 to 90 to 99th
percentile fighters and I'm some guy who

2211
01:34:19,361 --> 01:34:23,340
won a couple of fights and was terrible
in fights and,

2212
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:24,280
and I'm,
uh,

2213
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,113
you know,
I just,

2214
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:30,120
I don't feel qualified to,
to always criticized because I don't

2215
01:34:30,461 --> 01:34:30,950
know how to,

2216
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:32,690
I don't even know if it's necessary.
Yeah.

2217
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:36,110
I feel like the way I look at fights,
so what I try to look at fights is I

2218
01:34:36,111 --> 01:34:38,480
look at him like we're looking at
mathematics.

2219
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:42,200
I'm looking at like,
there's an equation going on and one,

2220
01:34:42,230 --> 01:34:46,820
there's values and there's numbers in,
in one side and his values and numbers

2221
01:34:46,821 --> 01:34:49,040
and the other side,
what's fascinating to me about this

2222
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:53,000
fight is there's,
there's equations where you have to

2223
01:34:53,001 --> 01:34:55,580
factor in many things.
You have to factor in power,

2224
01:34:55,581 --> 01:34:58,760
you have to factor in technique,
you have to factor in the ability to

2225
01:34:58,761 --> 01:35:03,761
execute and you also have to factor in
persona and personality and just

2226
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:06,740
charisma.
And it's one of the things that conor

2227
01:35:06,741 --> 01:35:11,630
brings to the table that's hard to,
it's hard to monetize or not monetize.

2228
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:15,260
It's hard to quantify.
It's hard to measure how much he fucked

2229
01:35:15,261 --> 01:35:16,250
with all those head.

2230
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,890
Sure.
Although just chased after him and get

2231
01:35:18,891 --> 01:35:20,120
lit up like that.
I mean,

2232
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,130
what,
what was it that caused,

2233
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:23,210
that was it,
there's a,

2234
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:28,480
there's many possible factors,
but all these movements in interactions

2235
01:35:28,971 --> 01:35:32,090
that they have,
I think you can almost look at them like

2236
01:35:32,091 --> 01:35:35,960
a mathematical exchange.
Like there's certain guys like Ed Short,

2237
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:36,740
fuse,
Herman,

2238
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,240
great guy,
tough guy,

2239
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,340
very good fighter.
Um,

2240
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,100
you're never going to confuse him with
wonderboy Thompson.

2241
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:44,870
Nope.
When it comes to like his footwork,

2242
01:35:44,871 --> 01:35:47,510
footwork and his movement,
if you looked at those two guys,

2243
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,880
mathematically,
he looked at them as an equation.

2244
01:35:49,881 --> 01:35:52,520
You Go,
this side is very lopsided in its

2245
01:35:52,521 --> 01:35:53,600
movement.
You know,

2246
01:35:53,601 --> 01:35:57,740
like if you have $100 in one hand and
$10 in the other hand,

2247
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,290
the hundred dollars is worth more than
$10.

2248
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,460
That's just,
it is.

2249
01:36:01,461 --> 01:36:01,900
Yeah.

2250
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:02,733
Yeah,
you're right.

2251
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:03,850
Um,
uh,

2252
01:36:03,851 --> 01:36:06,800
and all of that prefacing it was coming,
uh,

2253
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:12,100
to say that now that I've watched
through the eye that I'm thinking it's

2254
01:36:12,101 --> 01:36:14,770
connors,
I watching him and his Iwatch and

2255
01:36:14,771 --> 01:36:18,730
Connor,
I see a Deus Angeles as being taken to

2256
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:23,320
the best level of what you can take.
Guys who still are kind of sturdy.

2257
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:27,220
There's still got that old version of
strength,

2258
01:36:27,221 --> 01:36:29,780
different,
not sort of free and flowing just,

2259
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:33,790
and you see his telegraphing.
That doesn't mean he can't fuck you up.

2260
01:36:33,791 --> 01:36:37,960
Like just cause I would see that doesn't
mean you can do anything about it or

2261
01:36:37,961 --> 01:36:39,640
stop it.
Or if he ends up on the ground,

2262
01:36:39,641 --> 01:36:42,340
he's like,
who's fucking telegraphing now?

2263
01:36:42,341 --> 01:36:43,870
You know,
none of that may matter.

2264
01:36:43,871 --> 01:36:47,980
But that is what I definitely see now
that when I'm picturing what is connor

2265
01:36:47,981 --> 01:36:48,820
seeing?
Like you see,

2266
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:51,280
boom,
move back,

2267
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:52,300
boom.
Like it's,

2268
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:57,440
it's a much more sort of lady bird and
it's built around an old sturdy style of

2269
01:36:59,051 --> 01:37:04,051
building a fighter and condit and oh and
Mcgregor and all these guys believe

2270
01:37:04,601 --> 01:37:07,300
that.
The answer to that is not only mobility

2271
01:37:07,301 --> 01:37:10,150
where we move our feet,
but how we move through space.

2272
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:12,010
You know,
conduct comes on weird angles and

2273
01:37:12,011 --> 01:37:15,490
different things and that's gotta be
what he's seeing.

2274
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:17,430
Whether that matters or not,
it,

2275
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:19,910
it's suddenly doesn't matter at all.
If he puts you on a backend,

2276
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:20,763
caves are facing,

2277
01:37:21,310 --> 01:37:25,120
he's got,
he's got some very good movement himself

2278
01:37:25,121 --> 01:37:28,210
though.
Dosantos may telegraph things a little

2279
01:37:28,211 --> 01:37:30,790
bit,
but it's because he puts so much power

2280
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:34,510
into his shots.
What's shocking about him though is his

2281
01:37:34,511 --> 01:37:37,630
ability to close the distance.
It's very fast and he's not,

2282
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:38,620
you know,
that's one of the things that have

2283
01:37:38,621 --> 01:37:39,770
disagreed with,
with con.

2284
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:43,870
What Connor said is it,
he's a slower like stuck in the mud

2285
01:37:43,871 --> 01:37:44,910
version of Aldo.
Like,

2286
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,210
man,
I don't see that at all.

2287
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:47,950
I see a fucking savage.

2288
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,400
Yeah,
he is a fucking savage.

2289
01:37:49,401 --> 01:37:50,570
Like,
as I watched it,

2290
01:37:50,571 --> 01:37:54,050
it's like you're looking for what you
could think you could exploit.

2291
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:55,650
And that's the thing.
It's like,

2292
01:37:55,651 --> 01:37:56,520
okay,
I think I can,

2293
01:37:56,700 --> 01:38:00,300
I think I can see the things coming now
that may turn out to not be true,

2294
01:38:00,301 --> 01:38:03,450
and that's a bad time to figure that out
yet when you get ripped in the face.

2295
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:05,730
But uh,
but at the same time,

2296
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:09,090
it's also like the dude is just so
aggressively violent.

2297
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:11,950
Um,
but whether it's mcgregor is not at the,

2298
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:15,540
in my opinion yet,
or we haven't seen it at the Tom cruise

2299
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:18,270
level.
But let's say that you and I have a

2300
01:38:18,271 --> 01:38:19,980
really great fighter and somebody says,
well,

2301
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:23,010
give you guys $1 million if you can have
this guy beat dominick Cruz in five

2302
01:38:23,011 --> 01:38:24,570
years,
what do you do?

2303
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:30,290
If we start figuring out,
trying to teach him the same movement as

2304
01:38:30,391 --> 01:38:33,630
I'm dominick Cruz,
the most we can hope for is him

2305
01:38:33,631 --> 01:38:36,530
achieving dominick Cruz five years
earlier.

2306
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,310
You know,
the five years of learning it,

2307
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:39,780
dominant cruises improved for five
years.

2308
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:41,970
Right?
We've got to figure out the answer to

2309
01:38:41,971 --> 01:38:44,640
make it not about that.
That's the hard part.

2310
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:47,820
That,
and that's what connor and his people I

2311
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:52,821
think believe is it will make it not
about what he wants it to be about.

2312
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,050
Well don't you think with a guy like
dominick Cruz,

2313
01:38:55,051 --> 01:38:57,690
one of the reasons why dominic has
created that styles,

2314
01:38:57,691 --> 01:39:00,450
cause he's not capable of putting a guy
way with one shot.

2315
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:04,920
He's not that kind of conor mcgregor one
punch death touch kind of a guy.

2316
01:39:04,921 --> 01:39:07,890
He just doesn't have that.
So he's got to hit you with the volume

2317
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:12,090
and he's also very smart and very smart
guys don't want to get hit.

2318
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:15,270
So what do they do?
They incorporate a lot of foot work and

2319
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,730
dominic's footwork is pretty fucking
spectacular.

2320
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:20,100
I watched him,
we were all just hanging around

2321
01:39:20,101 --> 01:39:23,570
backstage one day and he and Brian Stann
in DC,

2322
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:27,660
we're talking just joking around and a
DC said,

2323
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:29,910
show me some of that footwork Brian,
or show me,

2324
01:39:29,911 --> 01:39:31,260
show me some of that footwork.
Um,

2325
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,660
uh,
dominic and he steps in with this

2326
01:39:33,661 --> 01:39:35,550
shuffle and then sidestep.
And I'm like,

2327
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:38,640
whoa.
Like when you see him just playing

2328
01:39:38,641 --> 01:39:40,440
around when someone's standing in front
of them,

2329
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:43,200
like a Brian,
Stan was just standing there for him and

2330
01:39:43,201 --> 01:39:45,930
he'd just like,
she don't like the way he's moving,

2331
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:49,620
calculate that.
You have to figure out like what you

2332
01:39:49,621 --> 01:39:52,350
think he's coming this way,
but he's going that way and then he's

2333
01:39:52,351 --> 01:39:53,520
coming this way again.
You're like,

2334
01:39:53,521 --> 01:39:56,060
wow,
this is amazing.

2335
01:39:56,220 --> 01:40:00,420
Like improvised.
Like these are like very specific,

2336
01:40:00,421 --> 01:40:02,060
very,
uh,

2337
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:05,670
the,
the amount of efficiency involved in

2338
01:40:05,671 --> 01:40:06,960
these movements are excellent

2339
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:08,030
to wild.
Um,

2340
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:10,810
and it's that same thing we were saying.
You know,

2341
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:14,020
I,
I don't do submissions from guard

2342
01:40:14,021 --> 01:40:16,180
anymore,
so all my training partners are not

2343
01:40:16,181 --> 01:40:18,910
dealing with that.
Some guys quietly just build in the shit

2344
01:40:18,911 --> 01:40:20,980
out of that.
Dominick's been too in that for 10

2345
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:22,680
years.
If you've tried to figure that out now,

2346
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,860
good luck.
10 years.

2347
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:24,641
Well,
here's what I want.

2348
01:40:24,641 --> 01:40:27,580
He did it in front of everybody.
They all saw him do it and they still

2349
01:40:27,581 --> 01:40:29,680
let him do it and they didn't try to,
you know what I mean?

2350
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:32,020
He did it right out in front of
everybody's nose.

2351
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:34,730
It's hard to figure out when you watched
him do it.

2352
01:40:34,731 --> 01:40:36,350
Even while he was doing it with Tj,
I was like,

2353
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:37,100
Calculus.
He,

2354
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:40,160
there's so many movements that he's,
he's capable of doing.

2355
01:40:40,161 --> 01:40:45,161
There's so many different combinations
of steps and exchanges and you think

2356
01:40:45,651 --> 01:40:49,400
he's stepping this way and he switched
stances and he goes off to the left and

2357
01:40:49,401 --> 01:40:50,720
he knows you're going to step in.
Like,

2358
01:40:50,721 --> 01:40:52,550
is this a movement trill?
Yeah,

2359
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:57,730
that's fine.
If you want to catch up to that.

2360
01:40:57,731 --> 01:41:01,630
He's been building that for 10 years in
front of everybody and everybody sat

2361
01:41:01,631 --> 01:41:03,340
around going,
well that's just dominic.

2362
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:04,960
Yeah,
I mean he's different.

2363
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,420
That's incredible.
Dominic would tell you he's not

2364
01:41:07,421 --> 01:41:08,530
different.
He would say,

2365
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:10,720
if you did this for 10 years,
you could do it too.

2366
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:13,360
You know what?
I wonder why he gets plantar fasciitis.

2367
01:41:13,361 --> 01:41:15,460
Exactly.
Jesus Christ.

2368
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,440
Yeah.
It's just incredible.

2369
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,840
I mean that's,
that's his solution for having,

2370
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:21,610
you know,
he says he has bitch hands,

2371
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,880
he jokes around about it cause he has
small hands and he's broken them several

2372
01:41:24,881 --> 01:41:25,720
times.
I mean,

2373
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:27,220
he put away Mitchell rocky in the first
round,

2374
01:41:27,221 --> 01:41:28,900
but it's very rare that he puts guys
away.

2375
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,210
He just doesn't have the physical frame
for it.

2376
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:34,390
But because of that,
he's developed all this incredible

2377
01:41:34,391 --> 01:41:36,010
movement.
It's one of the things I always tell

2378
01:41:36,011 --> 01:41:39,340
people when you learn Jujitsu,
don't learn Jujitsu from a gorilla

2379
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:41,980
learning from an Eddie Bravo or you
know,

2380
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:43,810
a small guy,
uh,

2381
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:48,610
you know,
a small physical like a guy was not

2382
01:41:48,611 --> 01:41:51,520
imposing.
Those guys are the ones you really want

2383
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:55,330
to learn technique from them because
they've had a develop that technique.

2384
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:58,780
It has to be laser sharp because they
don't have the ability to gorilla out of

2385
01:41:58,781 --> 01:42:00,010
things.
Now when you,

2386
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,230
when you learn Jujitsu from really big
people,

2387
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:04,570
man,
it's rare that they're technical.

2388
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:06,970
It's really rare because they can make
it work.

2389
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,070
Yes.
Yeah.

2390
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:09,400
You want to bear it,
Yoshida,

2391
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:12,670
right?
You want a little tiny guy that has just

2392
01:42:12,671 --> 01:42:15,970
laser sharp technique and Eddie Bravo,
a heuler gracie.

2393
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:19,900
You know,
a small person who's just got fucking

2394
01:42:19,901 --> 01:42:21,610
razors,
demendez brothers,

2395
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:26,110
perfect examples,
small guys with razor sharp technique.

2396
01:42:26,111 --> 01:42:28,300
And if you watch them roll against even
bigger guys,

2397
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:32,320
their technique is so fucking sharp they
they can get through.

2398
01:42:32,321 --> 01:42:36,730
Whereas like if you find a big guy who's
got gorilla Jujitsu and he fights a

2399
01:42:36,731 --> 01:42:38,350
bigger gorilla,
he gets fucked up.

2400
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:43,860
That's just what you said earlier when
the hoist went into ufc one because they

2401
01:42:44,051 --> 01:42:48,310
knew it would be that much more amazing
if the little dude did a sort of,

2402
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,740
that's not really what happened though.
That's the standard.

2403
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,020
That's the standard description of what
happened.

2404
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:56,710
What really happened was they couldn't
control Hickson.

2405
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:00,070
Hickson was the master of the family.
Everybody knew who was the king,

2406
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:03,130
but you couldn't,
like if Hicks and one,

2407
01:43:03,131 --> 01:43:05,620
he would be like,
I want $10 million and now I'm going to

2408
01:43:05,621 --> 01:43:07,790
go surf,
and he was just doing them to fucking

2409
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:11,830
wanted,
I mean hixon truly marches to the beat

2410
01:43:11,831 --> 01:43:16,831
of his own drum and no one could control
him and so his brother was not really

2411
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:18,700
interested in putting Hixon in that
position.

2412
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:23,730
The idea was put hoi sin if voice lost.
Then you go into negotiations with

2413
01:43:24,191 --> 01:43:28,150
Hickson and you get hixon because Hixon
is going to fuck everybody up.

2414
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,350
It would have changed everything though
if we,

2415
01:43:30,351 --> 01:43:33,040
it would have been different the way he
did it would have been different.

2416
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:35,050
Like if you ever looked at some of the
brutal beat downs,

2417
01:43:35,051 --> 01:43:37,000
the Gracie in action beat downs at
Hixson did.

2418
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:41,950
He's so God damn strong.
He's not just unbelievably technical

2419
01:43:41,951 --> 01:43:45,070
with his Jujitsu,
but also really physically,

2420
01:43:45,310 --> 01:43:49,120
really physically strong.
I think some of the audience,

2421
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:51,980
a lot of them maybe wouldn't have gone,
oh my God.

2422
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,320
Jujitsu's amazing data gone.
Holy Shit,

2423
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:56,840
this guy's a killer.
And hoists being there.

2424
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,120
It was hoist fighting tonight too.
I don't,

2425
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:01,750
I know it was this,
we're sitting here,

2426
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:05,480
hoist is going to fight and like three
hours is fifth in his fifties isn't at

2427
01:44:05,481 --> 01:44:06,330
least 50.
Right?

2428
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:09,680
I think the 10 or 10 and him are both
50.

2429
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,360
Yeah.
Just let them choose up.

2430
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,620
Let them juice.
Yeah.

2431
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:17,620
I mean they're probably Gunna,
if they can get around their fat,

2432
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:19,400
you know what I mean?
Like the 50.

2433
01:44:19,401 --> 01:44:24,401
Think about being 50 and I uh,
I still have this little tiny hint in

2434
01:44:25,221 --> 01:44:27,680
the back of my mind somewhere that I
could fight one more time.

2435
01:44:27,681 --> 01:44:30,380
Like it's just hidden back there.
You were just talking about your head.

2436
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:32,350
I know that your,
your is not so hot.

2437
01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:33,440
Yeah.
Uh,

2438
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:39,110
the um,
I have a weird sort of perspective on

2439
01:44:39,111 --> 01:44:39,760
that.

2440
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,470
Uh,
one that's why I think we have to

2441
01:44:42,471 --> 01:44:46,640
celebrate these fights way more because
these guys are getting hurt and they,

2442
01:44:46,641 --> 01:44:49,850
they're doing it for their,
or adventure or their reasons,

2443
01:44:49,851 --> 01:44:51,650
but they're still getting hurt.
But,

2444
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:55,550
um,
I was in Belize and with my wife and it

2445
01:44:55,551 --> 01:44:57,110
was beautiful actually.
It's beautiful.

2446
01:44:57,140 --> 01:45:00,830
And you meet,
there's a huge percentage of men over 40

2447
01:45:00,831 --> 01:45:05,831
that are blind and yeah,
they're blind because they have their

2448
01:45:05,901 --> 01:45:07,970
big at one of their biggest crops is
cashews.

2449
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:12,320
And something about the process of
cashew farming makes you go blind in

2450
01:45:12,321 --> 01:45:14,600
five years or 10 or 20 at some point.
Yeah.

2451
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:17,510
Certain certain people who work in
cashew farming,

2452
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:20,480
it's known that you will go blind.
Holy Shit.

2453
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,100
Um,
so when you're 20,

2454
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:24,980
cashews are not worth going over.
Man.

2455
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:29,360
And so when you were 20 and you say,
I'm going to be a cashew farmer,

2456
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:32,870
you're doing it with the knowledge that
you're going to be blind one day you

2457
01:45:32,871 --> 01:45:33,650
full knowledge.

2458
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:37,040
Cause you've known your grandfather,
you knew what a uncle there's was just a

2459
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:40,910
certain percentage of people and they do
it because at the end they will provide

2460
01:45:40,911 --> 01:45:42,650
for their family.
It's a good career.

2461
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:45,320
You will uh,
take care of your kids.

2462
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:48,950
And they do it knowing,
and people go and they work in mines.

2463
01:45:48,951 --> 01:45:51,290
People do all kinds of things that harm
themselves.

2464
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:53,390
But you need to know that it's
happening.

2465
01:45:53,391 --> 01:45:57,590
You need to be fully informed and make a
solid decision that this is what you

2466
01:45:57,591 --> 01:46:00,290
want to do.
And a lot of 17 year olds who go in and

2467
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:02,690
start boxing or whatever,
don't have all that information.

2468
01:46:02,830 --> 01:46:05,630
No they don't.
But if you have it and you're like,

2469
01:46:05,631 --> 01:46:07,550
this is my passion.
This is all I want to do,

2470
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:10,400
this is what I want to do with my life.
I was put on earth to fight.

2471
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:13,040
I know there'll be repercussions for
this in my future.

2472
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:14,780
And I'm choosing to do it.
Go do it man.

2473
01:46:14,781 --> 01:46:17,600
It's a free society.
You can eat as much sugar as you want

2474
01:46:17,601 --> 01:46:19,580
and that'll kill Ya.
You know you can do it,

2475
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:21,770
but you want people to know the
dangerous.

2476
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:25,130
I have no idea about cashew farm and he,
did you find anything on that Jamie?

2477
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:27,620
Please don't tell me that.
That's a myth.

2478
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:30,950
I didn't see anything about blindness,
but there's like blood cashews are

2479
01:46:30,951 --> 01:46:35,200
coming up and there's the way that they
farm them and get good them do shelled

2480
01:46:35,201 --> 01:46:38,420
is pretty bad and it causes people in
intense pain cause there's some sort of

2481
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:40,920
a liquid that comes out of them.
We pulled a show,

2482
01:46:40,921 --> 01:46:43,220
I don't know if penalty.
It's a chemical that's used and I don't

2483
01:46:43,221 --> 01:46:44,880
know.
I don't even know what cashew shell.

2484
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:49,040
I don't know either.
But it was something that was mentioned

2485
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:52,020
more than a couple of times in,
in um,

2486
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:53,173
whoa.
That's amazing.

2487
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:54,660
Yeah.
How weird.

2488
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:57,390
So I mean that chemical could be
connected to pain,

2489
01:46:57,391 --> 01:46:58,800
blindness,
maybe one of the effects.

2490
01:46:58,801 --> 01:47:01,980
But that was the story that I was told
more than a few times.

2491
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:04,680
Uh,
down there about that don't even look

2492
01:47:04,681 --> 01:47:08,380
real.
It looks like like Avatar plant.

2493
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:09,600
It's true.
No,

2494
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,060
it doesn't look real.
It looks like some sort of a weird,

2495
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:14,670
crazy squash.
But if you decide you're going to go

2496
01:47:14,671 --> 01:47:18,240
farm that stuff and you know what the
outcome is and you do it anyways,

2497
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:20,400
that's your,
you chose to do that for whatever your

2498
01:47:20,401 --> 01:47:21,040
reason.

2499
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:24,840
So you're not finding anything on
cashews causing blindness guys.

2500
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,050
Just try it.
Give it a,

2501
01:47:26,051 --> 01:47:28,480
give it a shot.
Yeah.

2502
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:31,510
It just makes me sad that these people
obviously don't have a whole lot of

2503
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:33,520
options.
It makes me not want to buy cashews,

2504
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,410
but then again,
then they don't have any money.

2505
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,460
Right.
The fuck do you do?

2506
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,490
Yeah.
Um,

2507
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:39,790
yeah,
fighting is,

2508
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,220
is also some people can get away with
it.

2509
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:46,510
Bas rutten who was here on Wednesday,
obviously former UFC heavyweight

2510
01:47:46,511 --> 01:47:48,340
champion,
one of the greats,

2511
01:47:48,341 --> 01:47:51,010
one of the real pioneers of the game.
Sharp as a tack.

2512
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:53,080
No problems mentally at all.
I mean,

2513
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:56,080
boss was just,
he was our 10 he's speaking a second

2514
01:47:56,081 --> 01:47:56,960
language by the way.
Yeah.

2515
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:58,210
You know,
he speaks Dutch.

2516
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:02,080
So in English he smooth as silk,
he's talking fast,

2517
01:48:02,081 --> 01:48:06,360
he's got all these great stories.
His memory sharp as a razor is noah.

2518
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:09,910
No problems with him at all.
And then of course we all know guys that

2519
01:48:09,911 --> 01:48:14,320
are punchy and um,
I've known a lot of guys from the time

2520
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:18,220
when I was a teenager and now today I
can't talk to them anymore because

2521
01:48:18,221 --> 01:48:20,530
they're fucked up guys from my old
boxing gym,

2522
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:22,290
they're fucked up man.
They're,

2523
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:23,710
they're,
they have real problems.

2524
01:48:23,711 --> 01:48:25,330
Like they're very,
very compromised.

2525
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:28,030
And I feel very fortunate that I'm not,
I'm sure,

2526
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:30,820
I'm sure there's something going on.
I'm definitely,

2527
01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:35,530
I definitely got hit a lot,
so I'm sure there's something that

2528
01:48:35,531 --> 01:48:39,040
didn't go well up in there.
Probably made me more impulsive,

2529
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,620
more angry or more,
I don't know.

2530
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:42,431
I mean,
I don't know what it is,

2531
01:48:42,431 --> 01:48:46,150
but overall I got out of it pretty
unscathed.

2532
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:48,670
But that's cause I stopped fighting when
I was 22.

2533
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:51,940
I realized at that age I was like,
this is,

2534
01:48:51,941 --> 01:48:53,590
I'm already getting headaches and this
is,

2535
01:48:54,370 --> 01:48:56,890
there's no future in it.
Back then there was no money in it.

2536
01:48:56,891 --> 01:49:00,640
Back then there was no mma.
It was just kickboxing and I was like,

2537
01:49:00,641 --> 01:49:01,690
man,
I'm not,

2538
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:03,100
this is not my,
you know,

2539
01:49:03,101 --> 01:49:05,440
I was way better at taekwondo then.
It wasn't kickboxing.

2540
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,251
You know,
I was,

2541
01:49:06,251 --> 01:49:10,780
my kicks were my biggest attribute and I
was learning how to box more and in that

2542
01:49:10,781 --> 01:49:12,570
learning I was getting the fuck beat out
of me.

2543
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,390
I definitely,
the most abuse I took was boxing.

2544
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:16,920
I love boxing.
Fun.

2545
01:49:16,921 --> 01:49:19,350
I love it.
And I took a lot of it.

2546
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:22,050
I remember I got,
I got a couple of concussions.

2547
01:49:22,051 --> 01:49:25,890
One for sure that I remember.
It's almost like life was different the

2548
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:29,910
moment after that concussion,
like the way that I saw the world was

2549
01:49:29,911 --> 01:49:32,700
different after I took that one punch.
It was just training.

2550
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,080
Oh.
So I just,

2551
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:35,880
I don't know,
my perspective,

2552
01:49:35,881 --> 01:49:39,030
my pr perception or something in like in
what way?

2553
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:42,360
I had a headache and I threw up that
night.

2554
01:49:42,361 --> 01:49:44,790
So it was,
I was in lethbridge and you know Jordan

2555
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:45,700
man.
Yeah,

2556
01:49:45,710 --> 01:49:48,280
his dad,
Lee is a good friend and Lee and Jordan

2557
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:51,010
were out of town.
And I went to train and this guy Dan

2558
01:49:51,011 --> 01:49:53,770
torture chambers,
who is a big powerful good one,

2559
01:49:53,771 --> 01:49:55,880
80 fiber.
And uh,

2560
01:49:55,950 --> 01:49:56,830
you were sparring with one.

2561
01:49:56,870 --> 01:49:58,240
Yeah.
I don't know what the fuck I was

2562
01:49:58,241 --> 01:49:59,950
thinking.
I actually danced at one 85.

2563
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:02,230
Yeah.
So you're saying this to hundreds to 10

2564
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,020
and I thought we were just going to
light spar,

2565
01:50:05,021 --> 01:50:09,100
but that's not what they do.
And I took a crazy straight,

2566
01:50:10,050 --> 01:50:11,320
uh,
oh yeah,

2567
01:50:11,450 --> 01:50:14,320
he was a south and I took a crazy
straight laughter or two from him.

2568
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:17,380
And then immediately something was
different.

2569
01:50:17,830 --> 01:50:21,100
And then I started slipping it and
hitting him with my left hook and I was

2570
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:23,290
happy.
There's moments in fighting where you

2571
01:50:23,291 --> 01:50:24,550
know,
you find out you're just not,

2572
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:27,310
I'm,
I'm not like Chris Weidman and you know,

2573
01:50:27,311 --> 01:50:30,670
that's just the truth.
But then there's moments in a fight or

2574
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:34,480
inspiring where you're like very proud.
Like when threatened with danger,

2575
01:50:34,481 --> 01:50:36,940
my answer was to fucking hit it back as
hard as I could.

2576
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:39,040
Right.
So got through the round or rounds and

2577
01:50:39,041 --> 01:50:40,390
then I just,
I had a headache.

2578
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:42,340
I couldn't think.
I went in,

2579
01:50:42,341 --> 01:50:46,490
I ring announced that night.
I started throwing up in the back and I

2580
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:48,520
just,
my thought process was different.

2581
01:50:48,521 --> 01:50:52,270
I was single at the time and there's
really cute girl was asking me to go

2582
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:57,570
hang out with her and I just couldn't
focus and I got better a month or two

2583
01:50:57,731 --> 01:51:00,250
later,
but I feel like that day was different

2584
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,330
like that.
After that,

2585
01:51:01,331 --> 01:51:03,670
yeah.
I really feel like I saw things

2586
01:51:03,671 --> 01:51:06,670
differently or thought differently or it
just,

2587
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:09,460
it's a moment.
It's a very distinct moment.

2588
01:51:09,461 --> 01:51:12,130
Like that time I almost didn't get off
the couch from the,

2589
01:51:12,131 --> 01:51:14,650
you know that that moment I was
different after it.

2590
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:15,800
Oh Wow.
No,

2591
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:17,860
you didn't even get knocked out.
No,

2592
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,660
that was really crazy.
You Bell rang,

2593
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:23,570
but you kept sparring,
so you series still mobile?

2594
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:24,950
Yeah.
Your legs were working.

2595
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:25,850
Got,
nope.

2596
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:26,900
Okay.
Then after,

2597
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:29,100
after that sparring,
the rest of the,

2598
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:32,720
I didn't really train anymore and then
he gave me a ride back and the rest of

2599
01:51:32,721 --> 01:51:33,950
the day,
even the ringing outs,

2600
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:37,250
I think I was probably behaving very
strangely during it.

2601
01:51:37,670 --> 01:51:41,600
And I don't remember that day super well
other than telling that pretty girl that

2602
01:51:41,601 --> 01:51:44,030
I couldn't hang out with her because my
head hurt so much.

2603
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:46,280
Uh,
I remember the rest of the round though,

2604
01:51:46,281 --> 01:51:49,940
and I remember and I got a concussion in
the first couple of shots of my first

2605
01:51:49,941 --> 01:51:52,400
fight too.
And I fought till about the middle of

2606
01:51:52,401 --> 01:51:54,140
the second round and I knew I was
different.

2607
01:51:54,230 --> 01:51:59,180
Like you just know.
But it's cool in a weird way that you go

2608
01:51:59,181 --> 01:52:02,600
and keep fighting because now I
understand it when I commentate or when

2609
01:52:02,601 --> 01:52:04,970
I'm analyzing it.
I've had that experience and that's why

2610
01:52:04,971 --> 01:52:07,130
I fought,
was to have that understanding.

2611
01:52:07,131 --> 01:52:11,660
But I know what it is to fight with a
concussion or spar with a concussion and

2612
01:52:11,661 --> 01:52:14,120
you see that guys do it.
They're hurting round one and they'll

2613
01:52:14,121 --> 01:52:15,410
fight all the way through sometimes when

2614
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:18,550
I wonder what,
if anything,

2615
01:52:18,551 --> 01:52:22,210
they're going to figure out in the
future to mitigate some of the problems

2616
01:52:22,211 --> 01:52:23,530
of head impacts.
You know,

2617
01:52:23,531 --> 01:52:27,370
whether it's going to be something with
stem cells or some sort of a new method

2618
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:32,371
of rehabilitating and healing people.
It's so depressing to me to watch this

2619
01:52:33,610 --> 01:52:38,610
incredible problem solving at its
highest level event like mma or like

2620
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:42,730
boxing or kickboxing or anything along
those lines.

2621
01:52:42,731 --> 01:52:46,370
What Paul,
but knowing that anytime like go con

2622
01:52:46,371 --> 01:52:49,760
Saki lands a head kick on somebody,
that guy might not ever be the same

2623
01:52:49,761 --> 01:52:52,790
again and that is a big fucking factor
that I,

2624
01:52:52,791 --> 01:52:56,270
I really get upset when people downplay
that.

2625
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:58,970
Like when you see someone get head
kicked and knocked dead,

2626
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:04,110
they might not ever be the same again.
That is a fact.

2627
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:09,430
I know guy back when I was a young kid
who got kicked in the head and the

2628
01:53:09,921 --> 01:53:12,470
doctor told him,
I don't want you to ever do combat

2629
01:53:12,471 --> 01:53:15,110
sports again.
I don't want you to ever do contact

2630
01:53:15,111 --> 01:53:17,480
sports again.
I don't want you playing football.

2631
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,580
I don't want you to do it.
You like stop.

2632
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,160
You have to stop.
Like you're,

2633
01:53:21,161 --> 01:53:24,480
you're,
you got fucking killed and you survived.

2634
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:27,470
You got real lucky.
And you see guys like that,

2635
01:53:27,471 --> 01:53:30,110
they get hit like that and then they're
fighting five months later,

2636
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:33,770
six months later and they not the same.
You could tell they're not the same.

2637
01:53:33,771 --> 01:53:35,210
They can't take a shot anymore.
Yeah,

2638
01:53:35,610 --> 01:53:36,780
it is spooky.
It,

2639
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:39,380
you don't know what the answer is.
Uh,

2640
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:41,910
cause there isn't really one now other
than the not,

2641
01:53:41,970 --> 01:53:46,890
you can't spar with big guys like that
and do it because it's fun and it's fun

2642
01:53:46,891 --> 01:53:47,820
to fight.
You should never,

2643
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:51,480
and most guys aren't doing that as are
many guys are not doing that as much.

2644
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,070
But it's,
you know,

2645
01:53:53,071 --> 01:53:54,210
this is,
to me,

2646
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:58,080
when you get the chance to have people
who have trained their whole lives to

2647
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:01,800
help us have an experiment in combat
right now,

2648
01:54:01,801 --> 01:54:05,040
in front of all of us that has such a
beautiful and wonderful thing in

2649
01:54:05,041 --> 01:54:06,290
humanity.
Like peep,

2650
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:10,860
we were fighting as a part of what we do
fighting as a part of us getting here.

2651
01:54:10,861 --> 01:54:14,820
It may be a part of our future depending
on where we are and what's happening and

2652
01:54:14,821 --> 01:54:16,920
different aspects of a fighting is a
part of us.

2653
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:21,540
And to see it done at that level and
this sort of almost global experiment

2654
01:54:21,541 --> 01:54:23,400
kind of way.
It's beautiful.

2655
01:54:23,401 --> 01:54:26,550
It's this wonderful,
incredibly artistic thing.

2656
01:54:26,970 --> 01:54:27,803
And,
but it's,

2657
01:54:27,810 --> 01:54:30,510
it has the downside.
And that's another reason.

2658
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:34,110
It just sickens me when I see the way
people respond to a Rhonda or respond.

2659
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:37,260
Connor's gonna lose one day and how
they're going to respond to that guy,

2660
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:38,100
you know,
uh,

2661
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,400
uh,
Johnny Hendricks,

2662
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:40,260
uh,
lost.

2663
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:42,840
How are people responding to this?
Because these guys are just doing

2664
01:54:42,841 --> 01:54:45,380
incredible,
incredible things for the,

2665
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:48,060
the furthering of what humanity is
capable of.

2666
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,670
Well,
people love to attack people when they

2667
01:54:50,671 --> 01:54:52,320
lose.
Like the way hendricks last,

2668
01:54:52,321 --> 01:54:53,510
I saw people attack,
you know,

2669
01:54:53,511 --> 01:54:54,120
in law.
I'm like,

2670
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:55,350
God dammit,
look,

2671
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:57,800
I just fought a wizard.
You know,

2672
01:54:57,990 --> 01:55:01,140
he fought like a real striking wizard
and he learned something.

2673
01:55:01,141 --> 01:55:03,900
People should have fucking me weighed
against Woodley,

2674
01:55:04,650 --> 01:55:05,640
fucking cheater.

2675
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:10,470
He was probably on pdds before all this
hate and nonsense and just terrible,

2676
01:55:10,471 --> 01:55:13,400
terrible fucking shit.
I read about him online with God,

2677
01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:14,760
I'll ever,
I'll everyone deals with it.

2678
01:55:14,761 --> 01:55:19,330
I've actually taken,
the only time I ever take stabs and you

2679
01:55:19,331 --> 01:55:20,420
know,
even talking about it,

2680
01:55:20,430 --> 01:55:23,400
I don't feel great about it,
but it's when guys Ms. Wade and other

2681
01:55:23,401 --> 01:55:24,900
fighters,
fighters are doing it.

2682
01:55:24,901 --> 01:55:27,990
Coaches do it.
It's just missing weight.

2683
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:31,620
There was always uh,
penalties for it.

2684
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,230
You're going to lose part of your purse
and public.

2685
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:36,930
You know,
finger pointing has always been a part

2686
01:55:36,931 --> 01:55:39,300
of that penalty.
Every other guy on that card has made

2687
01:55:39,301 --> 01:55:41,460
weight then that's the worst part about
their job.

2688
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:45,360
And hopefully guys are getting w I think
we are getting away from weight cutting

2689
01:55:45,361 --> 01:55:49,530
a little more as we're getting away from
the bodybuilder wrestler.

2690
01:55:49,531 --> 01:55:51,750
Wait,
it's a part of that uh,

2691
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:55,710
prototype of fighter and that prototype
of fighter is going to be keep getting

2692
01:55:55,711 --> 01:55:58,200
beaten.
Now that we have new answers to him.

2693
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:02,430
And I think as that fight or changes
that weight cutting is a part of that

2694
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,110
prototype.

2695
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:06,620
Well also you sada and the ivy band,
that's a big issue.

2696
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:10,190
As soon as they started banning the Ivs,
you saw people's body weights lowering

2697
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:14,810
because they realized they could make
that big crazy 25 pound cut in a couple

2698
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:18,410
of days and rehabilitate enough for
rehydrate enough rather to be able to

2699
01:56:18,411 --> 01:56:20,630
fight 24 hours later.
You just can't do it.

2700
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:23,600
You have to drop your body weight down.
You have to

2701
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:27,380
at Castro diuretics before you decided
to diuretics.

2702
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:32,740
We all hear who apparently is doing it,
but I talk about fighting all day on TV.

2703
01:56:32,890 --> 01:56:36,790
I can't address that because just
because some three coaches and two

2704
01:56:36,791 --> 01:56:38,650
fighters are like,
everybody knows that guy's doing it.

2705
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:40,150
Never failed a test.
There's no,

2706
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:43,660
there's no evidence.
It's just you can't really talk about

2707
01:56:43,661 --> 01:56:45,730
it.
You can make observations around it,

2708
01:56:46,330 --> 01:56:48,640
but the truth is that in that era,
man,

2709
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:52,510
if you were fighting Josh Barnett in
Japan,

2710
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:55,930
like you don't know what somebody else
might be on,

2711
01:56:55,931 --> 01:56:57,970
you don't know what vandelay might be
on.

2712
01:56:57,971 --> 01:56:59,610
You got to go over there.
You do.

2713
01:56:59,611 --> 01:57:01,900
You do what you thought you had to do.
You know,

2714
01:57:01,901 --> 01:57:04,450
if you were fighting in pride after a
few years,

2715
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,550
first call,
you got to make us to a doctor because

2716
01:57:06,551 --> 01:57:10,510
you may not want to do it.
It may be harmful for your future in

2717
01:57:10,511 --> 01:57:13,750
some ways depending,
but I dunno what I'm going to pride.

2718
01:57:13,751 --> 01:57:15,880
Look at the sky so they're all on
something.

2719
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:17,110
Yeah,
I need to fight.

2720
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:18,880
I've got to make,
you know,

2721
01:57:19,060 --> 01:57:21,130
you don't go ask the bodybuilder up at
the gym.

2722
01:57:21,131 --> 01:57:22,000
He go ask a doctor.

2723
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:23,440
Well,
it's interesting too because when you

2724
01:57:23,441 --> 01:57:26,950
watch guys that were competing in pride
and we're looking amazing,

2725
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:30,430
and then you see them when they got over
to the UFC and they weren't nearly as

2726
01:57:30,431 --> 01:57:31,430
good,
you have to look.

2727
01:57:31,450 --> 01:57:33,010
You have to think one of two things
happen.

2728
01:57:33,011 --> 01:57:35,530
Either they took so much punishment in
pride,

2729
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:38,320
but they never really fully recovered,
which is absolutely possible.

2730
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:40,380
Or they were on some shit.
Yup.

2731
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:42,370
And so both or both?
Yeah.

2732
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:43,630
Yeah.
Most likely.

2733
01:57:43,631 --> 01:57:43,720
Yeah.

2734
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:46,900
Most likely.
The thing people don't see,

2735
01:57:46,901 --> 01:57:48,040
somehow they,
oh,

2736
01:57:48,041 --> 01:57:50,770
that guy did steroids and now he's this.
That may be true,

2737
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:54,340
but the natural reaction is this.
Whether that's your hormones,

2738
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,920
your hormonal expression,
you're doing hand motions for people to

2739
01:57:56,921 --> 01:57:57,690
just listen to it.
Yeah,

2740
01:57:57,690 --> 01:57:59,540
yeah,
yeah.

2741
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:01,420
Uh,
and uh,

2742
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:02,141
you know,
your,

2743
01:58:02,141 --> 01:58:04,810
your hormone levels will crash.
And when they crash,

2744
01:58:04,930 --> 01:58:06,340
v like,
you know,

2745
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:10,000
tea,
our TV tour and Dad Bod Vitara is not

2746
01:58:10,001 --> 01:58:10,900
like,
you know,

2747
01:58:10,990 --> 01:58:14,230
in theory,
if you had to take trt because you had

2748
01:58:14,231 --> 01:58:17,440
no or very little testosterone,
well now that you're off it,

2749
01:58:17,530 --> 01:58:19,170
you're going to be dad bod.
Vito,

2750
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:23,440
when I saw that and it was no one,
I was really happy for [inaudible] to

2751
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:25,910
not look like a,
uh,

2752
01:58:26,230 --> 01:58:28,180
you know,
the incredible Hawk and still win.

2753
01:58:28,330 --> 01:58:30,400
That said a lot about it.
And when he fought Henderson,

2754
01:58:30,401 --> 01:58:31,234
yeah,

2755
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:32,430
yeah.
But who knows,

2756
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:33,860
who knows,
you know,

2757
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:36,630
that's the problem.
Who knows what kind of shenanigans are

2758
01:58:36,631 --> 01:58:37,411
going on,
for sure.

2759
01:58:37,411 --> 01:58:38,670
You know,
especially when you're fighting in

2760
01:58:38,671 --> 01:58:41,040
Brazil.
I hate to say it,

2761
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:42,370
but it is,
it is true.

2762
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:44,830
It's a different thing.
You know,

2763
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:49,860
I don't know what the future holds as
far as testing for performance enhancing

2764
01:58:51,431 --> 01:58:53,740
drugs,
but I've got to imagine that they're

2765
01:58:53,741 --> 01:58:57,430
closing in to the point where there's
almost no wiggle room and these guys

2766
01:58:57,431 --> 01:59:01,000
getting popped but never got pop before.
Like when glazing got popped and

2767
01:59:01,001 --> 01:59:01,811
everybody's like,
wow,

2768
01:59:01,811 --> 01:59:04,300
who fucking saw that comment guy looks
like the incredible hulk.

2769
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:07,090
So the biggest weight cutters in the
history of the sport,

2770
01:59:07,091 --> 01:59:11,190
I mean he is the biggest 155 pound
fighter I've ever seen in my life.

2771
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:15,290
Bigger than anybody.
Cause he would weigh one 55 it make

2772
01:59:15,291 --> 01:59:17,770
weight shredded and then the next day
you'd be like,

2773
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:19,390
Jesus Christ,
he's 200 pounds.

2774
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:23,080
He's so God damn big.
He was so big.

2775
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:25,480
Just swirl,
shredded,

2776
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:29,560
not an ounce of fat,
just gorilla strong and and freakish

2777
01:59:29,561 --> 01:59:33,010
endurance.
He popped hot for EPO.

2778
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:34,810
He pop top for something else.

2779
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:35,760
Yeah,
I forgot.

2780
01:59:35,761 --> 01:59:37,460
It might've been a diarrhetic too,
but then

2781
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:39,080
Ramiro,
another one.

2782
01:59:39,081 --> 01:59:41,120
You look at that guy and you go,
well just fucking,

2783
01:59:41,121 --> 01:59:42,170
how's that even human?

2784
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:45,370
I love the Usada Guy.
When he introduced the concept of the

2785
01:59:45,371 --> 01:59:47,620
smell test,
all that is basically like,

2786
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:50,230
come on.
That's what that is.

2787
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,520
Skis on top of the man.
He's,

2788
01:59:52,521 --> 01:59:53,870
he's giving these guys

2789
01:59:54,170 --> 01:59:54,830
base.
Yeah.

2790
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:56,450
That's the only way.
I mean either,

2791
01:59:56,990 --> 01:59:59,450
hey,
everybody can do whatever,

2792
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:01,490
which is probably going to be unsafe in
a lot of ways.

2793
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,800
Yes or well,
we're going to kind of test,

2794
02:00:03,801 --> 02:00:07,070
but you guys work around it.
Your work arounds will be an acceptable

2795
02:00:07,071 --> 02:00:09,890
amount of drug use that we're all going
to say we're okay with them.

2796
02:00:09,891 --> 02:00:10,590
Just,

2797
02:00:10,590 --> 02:00:12,240
well,
it's interesting because the UFC didn't

2798
02:00:12,241 --> 02:00:13,370
have to do this.
Yeah.

2799
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:15,450
I know.
This is all their own idea.

2800
02:00:15,451 --> 02:00:18,330
This is not instituted by the Nevada
state athletic commission.

2801
02:00:18,331 --> 02:00:20,850
This is entirely the UFC.
UFC.

2802
02:00:20,851 --> 02:00:23,250
His idea to bring into Wicki and say,
look,

2803
02:00:23,490 --> 02:00:27,180
let's fucking chase this down to the end
of the earth.

2804
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:29,610
What's,
find exactly what the fuck these people

2805
02:00:29,611 --> 02:00:32,760
are doing and let's clean up the sport
and you're seeing much more realistic

2806
02:00:32,761 --> 02:00:36,600
body's much more realistic performances.
You're seeing guys like Eric Silva like

2807
02:00:36,601 --> 02:00:39,750
change radically.
He looked like he used to look like,

2808
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:40,650
uh,
like uh,

2809
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:42,340
yoked up Bruce Lee.
Yeah.

2810
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:44,100
Right.
And then he became like,

2811
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,060
you know,
an athlete.

2812
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:46,140
You had a fucking regular athletes.

2813
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:49,050
Yeah.
I was in saskatoon when he fought and

2814
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:50,880
when he went out to do the open workout
where like,

2815
02:00:51,170 --> 02:00:53,550
oh,
this guy looks totally different.

2816
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:54,990
Totally.
You know,

2817
02:00:54,991 --> 02:00:59,991
it's funny being a fan or a fanatic fan.
Uh,

2818
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:02,940
people always,
there's a lot of that negativity we were

2819
02:01:02,941 --> 02:01:05,490
talking about.
People always want to take us a jab at

2820
02:01:05,491 --> 02:01:10,140
the UFC or Dana or whenever.
Nobody ever wants to point out the good

2821
02:01:10,141 --> 02:01:12,000
moves,
like the really positive moves that they

2822
02:01:12,001 --> 02:01:13,080
make.
And this is one of those,

2823
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,940
it's a big one that's,
you know,

2824
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:16,350
um,
you,

2825
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:22,080
you can't half asset because if you have
facet and leave it to the end.

2826
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:24,720
Nick Dana used to say,
it's not our job.

2827
02:01:24,721 --> 02:01:27,750
It's the commission's job.
The reason they instituted this is like

2828
02:01:27,870 --> 02:01:29,460
they're just not doing a good enough
job.

2829
02:01:29,790 --> 02:01:30,623
They're not.
So

2830
02:01:30,870 --> 02:01:33,510
it's doing is inexpensive and that's why
they would do it.

2831
02:01:33,770 --> 02:01:36,510
The,
the type of blood tests the Usada guys

2832
02:01:36,511 --> 02:01:41,330
are doing is so much more comprehensive,
which was also why it was so maddening

2833
02:01:41,331 --> 02:01:43,700
when Nick Diaz got in trouble because
Nick Diaz,

2834
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:46,890
and this is also to Novitsky his credit,
Novitsky was one of the ones that say,

2835
02:01:46,891 --> 02:01:49,340
this is fucking bullshit.
This suspension is bullshit.

2836
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:53,660
What they're doing is bullshit because
the Usada testing showed him under the

2837
02:01:53,661 --> 02:01:55,070
limit,
so he is fine.

2838
02:01:55,071 --> 02:01:57,350
Yeah.
And then they had some other wacky piss

2839
02:01:57,351 --> 02:02:00,020
test.
It's not nearly as as accurate and

2840
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:05,021
that's where he tested high.
And so they find them $100,000 now it's

2841
02:02:05,151 --> 02:02:05,820
a,
it's,

2842
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:10,040
it's went from one 65 down to 100 or
something like that.

2843
02:02:10,041 --> 02:02:12,000
And then they're,
they're going to give him a 16 month

2844
02:02:12,001 --> 02:02:14,900
suspension instead of three years,
five years.

2845
02:02:14,901 --> 02:02:16,040
And they were going to give him five
years.

2846
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:18,200
Well,
they just gave vandelay three years.

2847
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:18,890
Yeah,
you saw that.

2848
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:20,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

2849
02:02:20,091 --> 02:02:21,770
But here,
the problem with the vangely thing is

2850
02:02:22,010 --> 02:02:23,810
they did it just before he's going to
fight,

2851
02:02:23,811 --> 02:02:24,920
fade,
or in pride.

2852
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:27,110
Now if he goes or in rise in rather,
I'm saying,

2853
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,780
right.
I'm horizon probably never die,

2854
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:34,400
so he's going to fight or and rise in.
So he will have violated his band so

2855
02:02:34,401 --> 02:02:37,400
that it will essentially keep him out of
fighting in the United States forever.

2856
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:38,840
I mean,
yeah,

2857
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:40,440
that's a sneaky thing they did right
there.

2858
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:41,870
Yeah.
A lot of people aren't pointing that

2859
02:02:41,871 --> 02:02:43,940
out.
Like they kept that guy on the shelf.

2860
02:02:43,941 --> 02:02:46,160
They told him he's banned for life,
they fuck with them.

2861
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:49,070
They wouldn't give him a hearing.
They kept postponing the hearing.

2862
02:02:49,071 --> 02:02:53,000
Then coincidentally right after the guy
gets a big fight,

2863
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:53,950
he gets a for,
he's,

2864
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:55,600
he's gonna fight in August,
in,

2865
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:58,150
in a rising,
and then immediately they hit him with

2866
02:02:58,151 --> 02:03:01,660
his three year and I think he's only 17
months in the,

2867
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:05,330
for the original suspension from the
time that where they caught him to

2868
02:03:05,331 --> 02:03:07,340
today,
I think it's only 17 months.

2869
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:08,690
I think you're right.
If that's the case,

2870
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:09,620
that's,
you know,

2871
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:12,200
that's a year and five months is to,
guys still got another year and a half

2872
02:03:12,201 --> 02:03:14,390
to go,
so he can't fight fader.

2873
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:16,760
He can't get that payday.
Or he can go and say,

2874
02:03:16,761 --> 02:03:18,650
I'm going to finish my career in Japan.
He's Kinda,

2875
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:19,371
yeah,
he's got,

2876
02:03:19,371 --> 02:03:21,620
I think he's going to be sad for the
fans over here.

2877
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:25,070
What was the most sad thing was all
those crazy videos he was doing or

2878
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:28,100
saying the UFC is disrespecting the
athlete and they're paying it and then

2879
02:03:28,101 --> 02:03:29,390
the UFC is like,
all right,

2880
02:03:29,391 --> 02:03:32,360
well we're going to tell everybody how
much money you made and then you found

2881
02:03:32,361 --> 02:03:34,220
out vendorlink made $9 million and
you're like,

2882
02:03:34,230 --> 02:03:35,480
well yeah,
wait,

2883
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:36,314
wait,
you wait,

2884
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:38,500
that's not poverty.
Yeah Dude,

2885
02:03:38,501 --> 02:03:40,840
you made 9 million bucks.
Like yeah,

2886
02:03:40,841 --> 02:03:42,960
and he only won a couple of fights.
Yeah,

2887
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:48,160
I mean obviously so a fucking legend and
one of the all time greats and one of

2888
02:03:48,891 --> 02:03:51,560
my,
if I had to pick like three favorite

2889
02:03:51,561 --> 02:03:53,660
fighters is in that top three pretty
bad.

2890
02:03:53,690 --> 02:03:55,580
He was so much fun to watch.
He was just,

2891
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:59,350
when you saw vandelay Roland is risks
before those fights in the garage.

2892
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,370
Looking at that over there,
come on.

2893
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:05,120
He was chaos man.
Which is making what makes the cro cop

2894
02:04:05,121 --> 02:04:08,990
knock out of him even more impressive is
that cro cop showed the difference.

2895
02:04:08,991 --> 02:04:10,970
Man,
this is the difference between a guy's a

2896
02:04:10,971 --> 02:04:14,180
wild brawler and it new elite striking.
Yeah,

2897
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:15,193
for sure.

2898
02:04:15,390 --> 02:04:16,170
Yeah.
Uh,

2899
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:18,970
yeah.
You feel bad for vandelay the uh,

2900
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:21,990
that reaction with those videos and you
know,

2901
02:04:22,170 --> 02:04:24,280
he loved being a hero.
Yeah.

2902
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:26,070
He loved Dad.
Like when I talked to him,

2903
02:04:26,071 --> 02:04:30,330
he loved the people and he loved that
people celebrated a big reason that he

2904
02:04:30,331 --> 02:04:34,260
loved fighting was the audience.
And he told me that he loved it.

2905
02:04:34,530 --> 02:04:39,270
And then somewhere between shale in
ejecting some chillness in there and a

2906
02:04:39,271 --> 02:04:41,880
few other things,
suddenly the audience was negative

2907
02:04:41,881 --> 02:04:43,620
against vandelay for some length of
time.

2908
02:04:43,670 --> 02:04:45,040
It was the ultimate fighter.
Yeah.

2909
02:04:45,140 --> 02:04:46,760
He would just,
he acted like an asshole.

2910
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:49,790
He acted like a bully and an asshole and
it didn't work.

2911
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:52,160
Yeah.
And chill made him look like a fool.

2912
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:55,940
He may look very full verbally and then
physically when shale took them down,

2913
02:04:55,941 --> 02:04:56,420
like,
you know,

2914
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:58,140
really pretty easily chill made them

2915
02:04:58,270 --> 02:05:00,130
like an asshole.
That's where congress do you are now

2916
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:01,460
caught.
Has been compared to Emma.

2917
02:05:01,461 --> 02:05:02,960
I don't think it's not,
even though,

2918
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:03,891
yeah,
I can,

2919
02:05:03,891 --> 02:05:05,810
the thinking.
I don't think it's a similarity,

2920
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:09,530
but you can't fuck with guys who are so
good at that you will lose.

2921
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:11,450
You'll see they're going to affect your
performance.

2922
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:13,250
You're going to look bad.
I thought,

2923
02:05:13,570 --> 02:05:17,360
am I guy uriah figured out exactly how
to tangle with conor Mcgregor.

2924
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:21,720
Like he became kind of a friend and he
was a part of your writing.

2925
02:05:21,770 --> 02:05:24,060
Does he's got a jovial.
Yeah,

2926
02:05:24,110 --> 02:05:24,943
yeah,
yeah.

2927
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:28,490
He's a very likable looking like it's
going to be your Ryan Dominick Cruz.

2928
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:30,690
That's crazy.
What do you think about that?

2929
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:36,320
One of the reasons I wanted to fight and
wanted to learn more about fighting,

2930
02:05:36,321 --> 02:05:41,321
and one of the things that pointed me to
start pursuing this was uriah faber.

2931
02:05:41,330 --> 02:05:43,280
Mark Harmonic,
these little guys that fought,

2932
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:44,930
you know,
I'd like admiring them,

2933
02:05:44,931 --> 02:05:46,790
want it to be like them.
I was older.

2934
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:48,110
Um,
but,

2935
02:05:48,111 --> 02:05:50,120
uh,
but so I'm a Uriah guy.

2936
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:52,220
Um,
but when he went to fight Frankie,

2937
02:05:52,370 --> 02:05:57,370
my breakdown kind of was,
this guy's really fucking good at these

2938
02:05:57,381 --> 02:06:01,490
things and he's gets better at these
certain things,

2939
02:06:01,790 --> 02:06:03,620
but we got to see some kind of
innovation out of them.

2940
02:06:03,621 --> 02:06:08,180
We have to see something else.
Uriah wins with drive and determination

2941
02:06:08,181 --> 02:06:12,710
and he'll win every position he wins by
with will and he wins by overwhelming

2942
02:06:12,711 --> 02:06:14,120
you.
He can mentally break you.

2943
02:06:14,121 --> 02:06:16,580
He can't be stopped.
All of that is great,

2944
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:20,570
but we need something more technically.
We need some new tricks.

2945
02:06:20,571 --> 02:06:22,640
We need some shit that the other guy
doesn't know.

2946
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:26,390
He didn't have that against Frankie.
I'll say exactly the same thing for

2947
02:06:26,391 --> 02:06:28,880
dominick Cruz.
He must have some new things,

2948
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:30,710
some other stuff.
Just being the best.

2949
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:32,930
Uriah isn't going to win them this
fight.

2950
02:06:32,931 --> 02:06:35,330
I don't think he's got to have some
other different answers.

2951
02:06:35,630 --> 02:06:38,030
Yeah.
I wonder what he's doing as far as

2952
02:06:38,031 --> 02:06:41,000
working on his footwork and working to
try to deal with,

2953
02:06:41,001 --> 02:06:43,850
I mean he has fought him twice.
He's the only guy to beat dominic.

2954
02:06:43,851 --> 02:06:45,650
Yeah.
He caught dominic with a guillotine

2955
02:06:45,651 --> 02:06:48,680
their first fight.
And I wonder like what's,

2956
02:06:48,681 --> 02:06:51,710
I mean having the knowledge of having
faced dominic,

2957
02:06:51,740 --> 02:06:55,430
not just once but twice and especially
the second time he knocked him down a

2958
02:06:55,431 --> 02:06:56,560
couple of times.
Yeah,

2959
02:06:56,890 --> 02:06:59,240
very close fight.
Just like Tj was a very close,

2960
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:00,430
very close.

2961
02:07:00,430 --> 02:07:01,480
Um,
with uh,

2962
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:04,150
with dominic.
So we were to talk about this earlier.

2963
02:07:04,210 --> 02:07:05,440
So somebody says,
go,

2964
02:07:05,470 --> 02:07:06,730
go figure out,
here's your guy.

2965
02:07:06,731 --> 02:07:08,050
Go figure it out.
How to beat Dominick Cruz,

2966
02:07:08,051 --> 02:07:11,340
you have three years.
What the fuck do we do that I could,

2967
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,670
yeah,
like it's going to be a big one client

2968
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:15,450
factor.
Slow those legs down.

2969
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:17,910
I'm almost at all costs.
I think first of all,

2970
02:07:17,911 --> 02:07:19,500
you've got two things to consider.
One,

2971
02:07:19,740 --> 02:07:22,110
dominic is most likely not going to
knock you out with one punch.

2972
02:07:22,111 --> 02:07:22,771
Yeah.
Okay.

2973
02:07:22,771 --> 02:07:25,560
So he doesn't have the kind of knockout
power that a connor does where you

2974
02:07:25,561 --> 02:07:28,500
really have to be terribly fearful about
closing that distance.

2975
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:32,450
So you know,
his number one asset is,

2976
02:07:32,451 --> 02:07:34,140
is movement.
Chop those legs,

2977
02:07:34,141 --> 02:07:35,260
man,
chop those legs.

2978
02:07:35,261 --> 02:07:36,160
I,
if I was him,

2979
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:39,070
I would,
I would go and train with the best

2980
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:41,380
Moitai leg kicker I could find.
I would,

2981
02:07:41,410 --> 02:07:45,190
I would seek them out.
I would say this is priority number one

2982
02:07:45,310 --> 02:07:46,720
and maybe even,
you know,

2983
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:49,660
concentrate on switching stances quite a
bit because dominic,

2984
02:07:49,661 --> 02:07:52,390
we'll switch stances quite a bit.
And if your ride get switched to Ansys

2985
02:07:52,391 --> 02:07:56,110
and throw the power,
a back leg kick from the low southpaw

2986
02:07:56,111 --> 02:07:57,850
position and from Orthodox,
you know,

2987
02:07:57,851 --> 02:08:01,210
that would open up those kicks and,
and work on those combinations when

2988
02:08:01,211 --> 02:08:05,170
dominic is switching work on also going
across the top of the thigh,

2989
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:07,690
if he's not in the right position to
throw the outside leg kick,

2990
02:08:07,691 --> 02:08:10,510
if you were ordinarily going to incite,
throw it like an outside,

2991
02:08:10,511 --> 02:08:13,450
but go across to take that right step
and go across the top of the thigh.

2992
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:14,420
Slick stuff.
Yeah.

2993
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:17,800
Slick stuff.
So this is part of my mcgregor breakdown

2994
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:18,580
fat.
Ah,

2995
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:19,990
AH,
there's lots of little elements.

2996
02:08:19,991 --> 02:08:21,220
Uh,
but um,

2997
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:23,520
so,
uh,

2998
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:27,580
it was Jeremy Stevens,
I was asking him about fighting Max

2999
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:29,500
Holloway and he's like,
I'm like,

3000
02:08:29,501 --> 02:08:30,480
you know,
these guys who moved,

3001
02:08:30,481 --> 02:08:31,750
they're long,
they're going to be lateral,

3002
02:08:31,751 --> 02:08:32,920
all this kind of stuff.
And he said,

3003
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:35,710
we have to keep him in the headlights.
Right?

3004
02:08:35,711 --> 02:08:39,010
So we were a car and our headlights kind
of go out on an angle.

3005
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:41,950
If we keep them in that lit area of the
headlights,

3006
02:08:41,951 --> 02:08:43,780
that's great,
but he doesn't want to be there.

3007
02:08:43,810 --> 02:08:45,520
He wants to be outside of there.
So what are we doing?

3008
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:48,610
Small steps.
He's making grand movements,

3009
02:08:48,700 --> 02:08:51,580
but if we keep our headlights lined up
and we're working at angles,

3010
02:08:51,581 --> 02:08:54,310
the way a goalie looks at dealing with
something,

3011
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:57,130
we make small steps and small
adjustments to keep them in the

3012
02:08:57,131 --> 02:08:57,730
headlights.

3013
02:08:57,730 --> 02:09:01,150
Then when he goes to flee outside of,
they're quite simply the right kick is

3014
02:09:01,151 --> 02:09:03,940
the barrier that way.
And the left kick is the barrier that

3015
02:09:03,941 --> 02:09:05,740
way.
And we kind of shoe horn them into our

3016
02:09:05,741 --> 02:09:10,390
headlights as best as we can at Faber's.
Never really used leg kicks that way,

3017
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:11,680
but sure.
It's fucked.

3018
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:15,790
Sounds like a great idea if we can just
keep them in those headlights.

3019
02:09:15,940 --> 02:09:19,370
And as he goes to flee,
that extra weapon of the leg starts to,

3020
02:09:19,450 --> 02:09:22,960
if our headlights are a certain width,
the leg becomes the barrier to keep him

3021
02:09:22,961 --> 02:09:24,760
in there.
That's gotta be a starting point.

3022
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:28,420
How crazy it'd be.
Faber reunited with Duane Ludwig,

3023
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:31,120
but they buried all the bullshit God
together.

3024
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:33,730
It's so crazy.
It wouldn't happen because now that he's

3025
02:09:33,731 --> 02:09:36,610
with Tj and you know,
they've said so much bad shit about each

3026
02:09:36,611 --> 02:09:39,610
other and I don't think it would,
but it is too bad.

3027
02:09:39,611 --> 02:09:41,980
But he needs someone like that.
You know,

3028
02:09:41,981 --> 02:09:44,530
he needs someone who's going to really
tighten up those,

3029
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:47,800
those footwork movements in those leg
kick movements.

3030
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:51,640
But if we saw a totally different Uriah,
imagine that he comes out of hands up

3031
02:09:51,641 --> 02:09:53,500
high and just starts attacking those
legs.

3032
02:09:53,830 --> 02:09:54,663
I mean,
that would be,

3033
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:56,250
it would be,
uh,

3034
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:57,760
oh shit.
Again,

3035
02:09:57,761 --> 02:09:59,750
with the memory,
who's Sa that,

3036
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:02,410
uh,
Jorgensen when uriah fought Jorgenson,

3037
02:10:02,411 --> 02:10:05,050
that was my favorite performance ever.
And that's,

3038
02:10:05,390 --> 02:10:08,590
uh,
the Duane Ludwig was cornering him and

3039
02:10:08,591 --> 02:10:10,750
he did something.
We see Tj do a lot,

3040
02:10:11,290 --> 02:10:14,170
I call it like a shell game or like a
cue ball and cups.

3041
02:10:14,230 --> 02:10:16,000
Like you know,
we've got three cups,

3042
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:19,080
which one has the ball when,
when Tj,

3043
02:10:19,470 --> 02:10:21,010
uh,
the changes this level,

3044
02:10:21,011 --> 02:10:24,130
obviously that can be a takedown,
but it can also from there he comes up

3045
02:10:24,131 --> 02:10:26,010
with the right upper cut from the same
spot.

3046
02:10:26,011 --> 02:10:28,660
It comes up with the left high kick.
He has takedowns,

3047
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:31,090
he has so many things and it all centers
on that,

3048
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:34,160
that position,
which is fucking shows how smart Duane

3049
02:10:34,161 --> 02:10:36,680
is.
We have these wrestlers in wrestling,

3050
02:10:36,710 --> 02:10:39,980
they have this level change spot that's
going to be the home to many of our

3051
02:10:39,981 --> 02:10:40,730
attacks.

3052
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:43,370
And uriah did that awesomely against
Jorgenson.

3053
02:10:43,371 --> 02:10:46,370
Now Jorgensen's not dominick Cruz,
but he did it so beautifully.

3054
02:10:46,371 --> 02:10:50,270
The level change became a starting point
for like eight different options.

3055
02:10:50,630 --> 02:10:54,920
Tj tried to use that with crews,
but dominick Cruz literally one.

3056
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:56,690
When a magician,
you're a magician,

3057
02:10:56,691 --> 02:10:59,450
you're trying to do a trick on me or a
comedian trust to tell you a joke.

3058
02:10:59,451 --> 02:11:02,840
You like a fucking hurt all these jugs
or I've seen all these tricks.

3059
02:11:02,930 --> 02:11:05,360
You see a magician can't do that to
another magician.

3060
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:07,550
So cruise just wouldn't play with Paul a
cup game.

3061
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:08,870
He's like,
I'll dance around out here.

3062
02:11:08,871 --> 02:11:11,420
You Chase me around,
put your ball and cups on like a little

3063
02:11:11,421 --> 02:11:13,010
trolley and try to convince me to play
it.

3064
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:14,720
I'll just kick them off,
you know?

3065
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:18,650
And so that he's just different like and
cruises.

3066
02:11:18,651 --> 02:11:21,050
So fucking smart.
Like he's so brilliant,

3067
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:21,800
you know?

3068
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:25,670
And that goes right back to that sort of
growth mindset.

3069
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:28,430
When the guy had fucked up legs,
he's like,

3070
02:11:28,431 --> 02:11:31,280
well I still got to get better.
I'll learn more about fighting.

3071
02:11:31,281 --> 02:11:34,310
I'll learn to explain it better.
I'll learn to analyze it better.

3072
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:37,460
I'll make myself understand it more.
He used,

3073
02:11:37,461 --> 02:11:39,920
instead of that being,
well two years down the tubes,

3074
02:11:39,921 --> 02:11:43,760
it was like two years,
I'm going to gain other skills and other

3075
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:46,010
applicable skills.
And it made them way better.

3076
02:11:46,011 --> 02:11:47,810
He's way better cause he had that
surgery,

3077
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:49,970
you know?
Then if he just was in the gym and he

3078
02:11:49,971 --> 02:11:51,440
never was forced to take that time.

3079
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:53,010
Yeah,
I bet you're probably right.

3080
02:11:53,011 --> 02:11:56,190
And he's one of my favorite analysts
breaks down fights into,

3081
02:11:56,191 --> 02:11:59,220
especially when it comes to making
mistakes in the striking,

3082
02:11:59,570 --> 02:12:02,100
you know,
leaving yourself open to get hit.

3083
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:05,220
He's so good at not getting hit.
It's one of the best things.

3084
02:12:05,221 --> 02:12:10,221
He is so good at explaining how to not
get hit or why someone made a mistake in

3085
02:12:11,461 --> 02:12:12,294
getting hit.

3086
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:12,920
Yeah.
Oh,

3087
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:13,830
he's,
he's so brilliant.

3088
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:15,420
I love,
it's funny too.

3089
02:12:15,421 --> 02:12:18,120
It's like I've,
I've met him like once I,

3090
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:19,980
when he,
it was Tj and him,

3091
02:12:20,130 --> 02:12:23,040
I was asking him about the fight and I
could see him going,

3092
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:24,900
okay,
let's get kinda knows about fighting

3093
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:26,940
because he doesn't give a fuck if you
like him.

3094
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:28,590
You know what I mean?
Dominick Cruz,

3095
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:31,590
I like that about him.
I liked that about even the way he does

3096
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:34,560
analysis or commentary.
He doesn't really give a fuck.

3097
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:36,870
You asked me to analyze some shit.
I'm going to analyze.

3098
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:39,040
He's doing it like mathematics.
Yeah.

3099
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:40,710
Yeah.
One plus one is one whether you want,

3100
02:12:40,711 --> 02:12:41,391
yeah,
yeah.

3101
02:12:41,391 --> 02:12:43,730
Ryan was one is to see,
I can't even count with that one.

3102
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:44,570
Plus one.
One.

3103
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:45,403
Yeah.
Fuck was saying,

3104
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:48,320
he's like,
he's putting it together in a really

3105
02:12:48,321 --> 02:12:49,970
clear,
obvious manner.

3106
02:12:50,210 --> 02:12:53,690
And if it isn't,
you don't have to enjoy his personality

3107
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:55,880
in order to appreciate the brilliance of
what you're saying.

3108
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:57,920
Yeah.
But I like his personality and I think

3109
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:00,170
it's a super smart,
articulate guy.

3110
02:13:00,171 --> 02:13:02,000
We only,
we did a little bit of commentary

3111
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:04,550
together aside and uh,
I really enjoyed it.

3112
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:08,090
I really enjoyed like being able to
bounce ideas off of them and ask

3113
02:13:08,091 --> 02:13:11,120
questions and I would like to do that
with a bunch of different kinds of

3114
02:13:11,121 --> 02:13:13,340
fighters too because guys who aren't
like him,

3115
02:13:13,341 --> 02:13:15,950
maybe like a Damien Maia,
like one of my favorite,

3116
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:19,610
um,
when Damien Maia Far Neil Magni,

3117
02:13:19,870 --> 02:13:20,770
uh,
I was,

3118
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:24,350
I couldn't wait to interview him because
I wanted to know like what adjustments

3119
02:13:24,351 --> 02:13:26,630
he was making when he couldn't tap him
from his back.

3120
02:13:26,630 --> 02:13:30,290
And then he eventually did get it and he
was explaining to me how he saw that he

3121
02:13:30,291 --> 02:13:32,250
was defending on one side.
So we started turning them towards the

3122
02:13:32,251 --> 02:13:35,550
other side and setting them up to defend
on that side so he could catch them on

3123
02:13:35,551 --> 02:13:36,700
the other side.
Yes.

3124
02:13:36,990 --> 02:13:37,551
Oh Man.
It's,

3125
02:13:37,551 --> 02:13:38,790
it's,
it's so important.

3126
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:39,750
It's,
it's everything.

3127
02:13:39,751 --> 02:13:44,751
It's one of the most important things
about mma is analization of technique.

3128
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:50,040
And having that fighter explained to you
can,

3129
02:13:50,041 --> 02:13:51,570
it's,
it illuminates things in such a

3130
02:13:51,571 --> 02:13:53,430
beautiful way.
Like when I say,

3131
02:13:53,431 --> 02:13:54,930
well,
what did you see that was his,

3132
02:13:54,931 --> 02:13:57,480
well,
when I saw when he kept blocking on this

3133
02:13:57,481 --> 02:14:02,481
side or he kept moving towards that,
so I was going to try to pretend that I

3134
02:14:02,761 --> 02:14:04,290
was gonna do the same thing I was doing
before,

3135
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:05,490
but set them up for a difference.

3136
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:08,850
And uh,
that level of like,

3137
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:12,810
his skill level is so incredibly mind.
Bogglingly hi.

3138
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:14,830
It's so easy for him to think in there.
Yeah.

3139
02:14:14,910 --> 02:14:17,250
Like a lot of guys guys and fight number
three.

3140
02:14:17,251 --> 02:14:18,180
He's like eight.
No,

3141
02:14:18,181 --> 02:14:20,820
and it's UFC fight too.
It's like got to get the chuck got to

3142
02:14:20,821 --> 02:14:22,400
get the shotgun and I got to stop in the
chocolate cake.

3143
02:14:22,401 --> 02:14:25,650
I'll try to get it on.
Like it's just the thought processes and

3144
02:14:25,651 --> 02:14:28,380
as clear and concise as Damien Maia,
who's like,

3145
02:14:28,590 --> 02:14:31,680
all right Jiu Jitsu.
I do this every day for my whole life.

3146
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:32,753
And you don't

3147
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:35,680
interesting about Maya as opposed to
anybody else too.

3148
02:14:35,890 --> 02:14:38,170
He's really adamant about not wanting to
hurt people.

3149
02:14:38,230 --> 02:14:39,580
Yeah.
He's like,

3150
02:14:39,581 --> 02:14:40,450
you know,
once I,

3151
02:14:40,451 --> 02:14:41,650
you know,
I got him to the ground,

3152
02:14:41,651 --> 02:14:43,590
you know,
I throw a few punches just to open him

3153
02:14:43,591 --> 02:14:44,980
up,
but I really wanted to get the choke.

3154
02:14:44,981 --> 02:14:45,970
I don't want to hurt him.
I'm like,

3155
02:14:45,971 --> 02:14:47,660
wow,
I don't want to hurt him.

3156
02:14:47,670 --> 02:14:49,390
Mild.
This is like,

3157
02:14:49,391 --> 02:14:51,520
that is his real mentalities.
I'm bullshitting.

3158
02:14:51,521 --> 02:14:53,050
He's not trying to get you to like him
more,

3159
02:14:53,051 --> 02:14:55,930
but pretending to be more,
more kind and peaceful.

3160
02:14:55,931 --> 02:14:57,790
No,
he really is not trying to hurt you.

3161
02:14:57,791 --> 02:14:59,380
He's trying to,
he's just trying to win.

3162
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:05,360
Uh,
fighting isn't violence like it isn't,

3163
02:15:05,980 --> 02:15:08,080
it doesn't have to be competition.
Yeah.

3164
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:09,500
It happens to be violent.
Yeah.

3165
02:15:09,820 --> 02:15:12,550
But it is competition.
It's violent.

3166
02:15:12,970 --> 02:15:14,850
When Rumble Johnson funds,
it's fucking fine.

3167
02:15:14,990 --> 02:15:15,823
Yeah.
Okay.

3168
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,313
Yeah,
that's true,

3169
02:15:17,650 --> 02:15:19,280
man.
He's so that the,

3170
02:15:19,450 --> 02:15:24,010
the thing about rumble Johnson that
doesn't get enough people can't

3171
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:26,470
necessarily appreciate is how good he
is.

3172
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:27,850
Yeah.
Like everybody always got power.

3173
02:15:27,970 --> 02:15:28,990
Yes,
he has power,

3174
02:15:28,991 --> 02:15:30,940
he has crazy power,
but he also,

3175
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:32,980
when you watch his hips and you watch
his feet,

3176
02:15:33,190 --> 02:15:38,190
he is in position to deliver power
anywhere all the time.

3177
02:15:38,501 --> 02:15:41,920
And that,
like when you were trying to figure out,

3178
02:15:41,921 --> 02:15:45,700
you know how cm punk is gonna fight and
I'll talk to people who've never trained

3179
02:15:45,701 --> 02:15:47,090
or it never studied training or
whatever,

3180
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:47,531
they're like,
well,

3181
02:15:47,531 --> 02:15:49,740
he could be pretty good.
It's like there,

3182
02:15:49,930 --> 02:15:53,560
I can tell you exactly how good you can
be at this stage because if you look at

3183
02:15:53,561 --> 02:15:56,650
the very best people you've ever watched
train with the best coaches at 18

3184
02:15:56,651 --> 02:15:58,720
months,
this is maybe what they're capable of

3185
02:15:58,721 --> 02:16:01,750
and he's 36 or whatever and he's not a
super athlete,

3186
02:16:01,930 --> 02:16:03,130
so it'll be a little less than that.

3187
02:16:03,140 --> 02:16:04,450
He's fucked,
he's fucked,

3188
02:16:04,451 --> 02:16:05,830
he's fucked.
And he made a big,

3189
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:09,700
I feel like I feel for him because I
looked at that when he started doing

3190
02:16:09,701 --> 02:16:10,270
that,
I was like,

3191
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:12,370
I know exactly how we feel.
I want it to fight.

3192
02:16:12,371 --> 02:16:13,960
I want it to figure it out.
I want it to get in there.

3193
02:16:14,230 --> 02:16:17,520
But there's that thing.
Um,

3194
02:16:18,010 --> 02:16:20,080
unconscious incompetence,
right?

3195
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:21,910
Yeah.
Unconscious incompetence.

3196
02:16:22,030 --> 02:16:24,760
You don't know what the fuck you're
talking about and you don't even know

3197
02:16:24,761 --> 02:16:25,960
that.
You don't know what the fuck you're

3198
02:16:25,961 --> 02:16:28,060
talking about.
And if you learn enough,

3199
02:16:28,061 --> 02:16:30,610
eventually you get incompetence where
you're like,

3200
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:32,620
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about,

3201
02:16:32,621 --> 02:16:35,050
but at least I know that so I can start
learning some shit.

3202
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:37,870
Right.
Then you'll get conscious competence

3203
02:16:37,871 --> 02:16:38,621
where you're like,
yeah,

3204
02:16:38,621 --> 02:16:40,810
I'm pretty good.
I got to think about it a consciously

3205
02:16:40,811 --> 02:16:41,620
I'm working at it,
but I mean,

3206
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:44,950
and then the greats are unconscious
competence.

3207
02:16:45,070 --> 02:16:46,690
Yeah.
I don't have to think Damien Maia

3208
02:16:46,691 --> 02:16:49,890
doesn't have to fucking think about it
the most that this,

3209
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:53,740
he was unconsciously incompetent when he
said he wanted to fight in the UFC.

3210
02:16:53,741 --> 02:16:57,190
And I feel for him,
like I feel the guy didn't know what he

3211
02:16:57,191 --> 02:16:58,900
was doing.
It sounded like a cool thing.

3212
02:16:58,990 --> 02:17:02,640
He's a driven guy who believes you can
achieve what you put your mind to and

3213
02:17:02,650 --> 02:17:05,670
you work really hard.
He just was unconsciously incompetent.

3214
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:09,010
He didn't have enough knowledge to know
how much could be acquired,

3215
02:17:09,011 --> 02:17:12,430
what he might be capable of if he worked
harder than anyone I've ever worked in

3216
02:17:12,431 --> 02:17:15,370
his life for 18 months.
He didn't understand how low that would

3217
02:17:15,371 --> 02:17:16,480
be.
You know,

3218
02:17:16,590 --> 02:17:18,070
still suck.
You suck.

3219
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:23,160
No background in combat sports at all
and you're 36 years old and you think

3220
02:17:23,161 --> 02:17:25,020
you're going to fight in the UFC and a
year.

3221
02:17:25,380 --> 02:17:26,310
That's almost insulting.

3222
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:27,120
Yeah.
Yeah,

3223
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:30,950
and Kudos to him for giving it a shot.
I understand the motivation,

3224
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:35,960
but I got mocked and ridiculed and
fucking ended up with a concussion when

3225
02:17:35,961 --> 02:17:38,620
I did it on the smallest levels.
People who are in fighting,

3226
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:40,490
who the fuck is this guy to come into
fighting?

3227
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:43,700
So I feel for him that way.
I know he probably really loves

3228
02:17:43,701 --> 02:17:47,750
fighting.
He just didn't know how shitty was the

3229
02:17:47,751 --> 02:17:52,751
maximum he could get at this stage.
And that level of shininess is not good

3230
02:17:53,181 --> 02:17:56,110
enough to ever fight in the UFC.
Nevermind debut in the US.

3231
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:58,810
It's also,
I don't think he's that much of an

3232
02:17:58,811 --> 02:17:59,860
athlete.
No.

3233
02:17:59,890 --> 02:18:03,280
Like when I watch him move I watches,
but there's nothing about him where I go

3234
02:18:03,281 --> 02:18:03,701
like,
well,

3235
02:18:03,701 --> 02:18:06,520
okay,
we're watching like a brock lesnar.

3236
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:09,370
Brock Lesnar was up fucking freak
athlete.

3237
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:11,060
You would watch that guy who went out
there.

3238
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:12,790
I remember the first time I saw barack
fight,

3239
02:18:13,090 --> 02:18:15,970
I saw him fight.
I mean I obviously had seen some videos

3240
02:18:15,971 --> 02:18:19,360
of him and wwe doing some spectacular
shit.

3241
02:18:19,361 --> 02:18:22,690
He's a physical specimen beyond compare.
Right.

3242
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:26,080
But when I saw him fight in k one,
I was in uh,

3243
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:28,570
La when they fought and uh,
he took,

3244
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:30,730
fought some Japanese gentlemen,
took them down,

3245
02:18:30,731 --> 02:18:32,410
just smashed him.
I remember thinking,

3246
02:18:32,411 --> 02:18:36,520
good luck keeping that motherfucker off.
That's a totally different kind of a

3247
02:18:36,521 --> 02:18:39,840
thing with this cm punk guy.
What you guys a good looking guy who

3248
02:18:39,860 --> 02:18:43,120
speaks well,
he's got a lot of charisma and that led

3249
02:18:43,121 --> 02:18:47,170
him to the top in wrestling,
but if you watch his wrestling moves

3250
02:18:47,410 --> 02:18:50,620
like there's nothing because nothing
ridiculous about it.

3251
02:18:50,621 --> 02:18:53,740
You look at his body has nothing
ridiculous about his body.

3252
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:56,320
He's not doing anything out of the
ordinary.

3253
02:18:56,560 --> 02:19:01,360
He just didn't understand how lo,
how little it could be a knowledge and

3254
02:19:01,361 --> 02:19:04,180
skill could be acquired in the time that
he was going to look at.

3255
02:19:04,181 --> 02:19:06,910
He just couldn't know that.
Now if you see him training,

3256
02:19:06,970 --> 02:19:09,370
I've seen a bit of it,
you know like it's looks where you'd

3257
02:19:09,371 --> 02:19:11,920
think a guy who worked really hard for a
year and a half would be,

3258
02:19:11,921 --> 02:19:13,680
which is okay if you're just watch some
of it.

3259
02:19:13,681 --> 02:19:15,850
Yeah,
I mean see if you can find cm punk

3260
02:19:15,851 --> 02:19:16,720
training.
Yeah.

3261
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:18,580
What's that?
I'd be looking right now.

3262
02:19:18,581 --> 02:19:20,830
They had this no videos for me anytime
recently.

3263
02:19:20,831 --> 02:19:22,750
There's like some stuff I'm looking at
from August.

3264
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:25,810
Let's try that.
I brought him up when I was talking

3265
02:19:25,811 --> 02:19:30,170
about Anthony Johnson is one of the
first things that you find when you go

3266
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:32,090
and uh,
let's see what we got here.

3267
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:33,650
I'll tell you that.
Uh,

3268
02:19:33,890 --> 02:19:36,800
what you find is that you can do these
things,

3269
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:39,770
but as soon as the guy is moving,
you're not in balance anymore.

3270
02:19:39,830 --> 02:19:41,150
Right.
As soon as you're in reality,

3271
02:19:41,151 --> 02:19:45,230
you're not imbalanced.
I mean the athleticism stuff here,

3272
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:50,450
this is not cm punk.
Oh cm punk train exos performance

3273
02:19:50,451 --> 02:19:51,780
center.
Okay.

3274
02:19:52,010 --> 02:19:54,050
I mean that's a guy working out,
you know,

3275
02:19:55,080 --> 02:19:56,000
it doesn't show too much.
Yeah,

3276
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:59,360
that's it.
I saw him hitting pads at one point.

3277
02:19:59,361 --> 02:20:03,890
I looked like this.
Like this is jumping up on these boxes.

3278
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:06,700
Yeah.
I mean I don't know.

3279
02:20:07,330 --> 02:20:08,200
I just,
it's,

3280
02:20:08,470 --> 02:20:10,900
it's not a knock against him.
No,

3281
02:20:10,930 --> 02:20:12,840
he just didn't know he was
unconsciously.

3282
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:15,300
What's the main chief?
It's like we were talking,

3283
02:20:15,330 --> 02:20:17,400
it's mathematics.
It's similar.

3284
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:19,530
Okay.
Here we see his golf.

3285
02:20:19,540 --> 02:20:20,460
First of all,
look at this.

3286
02:20:20,570 --> 02:20:21,940
Yeah,
he's a fucking white belts.

3287
02:20:21,950 --> 02:20:23,190
Yeah,
this is crazy.

3288
02:20:23,370 --> 02:20:26,070
And he's doing this with Hender Gracie.
Okay.

3289
02:20:26,071 --> 02:20:29,180
So as I'm sure doing some plank cause
all workouts,

3290
02:20:29,580 --> 02:20:31,970
old goodwill,
okay.

3291
02:20:32,130 --> 02:20:33,000
But even that,
I mean,

3292
02:20:33,001 --> 02:20:34,920
two years,
the reality is,

3293
02:20:34,921 --> 02:20:38,670
unless you're 20 years old,
two years is not really a lot of time to

3294
02:20:38,671 --> 02:20:39,910
get prepared for something.
You've,

3295
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:42,780
you're a 20 year old guy,
you can watch someone as a blue belt at

3296
02:20:42,781 --> 02:20:46,770
20 years and then in two years there a
black belt that is possible if you're

3297
02:20:46,771 --> 02:20:48,510
obsessed,
if you're a fucking maniac,

3298
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:51,330
if you're a real nut,
if you're some Bj Penn when he was in

3299
02:20:51,331 --> 02:20:53,940
his prime.
But you know,

3300
02:20:53,941 --> 02:20:56,130
this guy probably likes pussy,
likes to eat,

3301
02:20:56,131 --> 02:20:57,900
he's got bills,
got taxes,

3302
02:20:57,901 --> 02:20:59,970
he pays,
he's probably got media obligations.

3303
02:21:00,390 --> 02:21:05,390
Know you ain't ain't that easy to become
a complete fucking obsessed freak.

3304
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:08,820
And then again,
the whole thing is like athletically,

3305
02:21:08,910 --> 02:21:12,990
his body did not develop to explode.
I have a good buddy of mine who's very

3306
02:21:12,991 --> 02:21:15,390
good at Jujitsu and I brought him to a
boxing gym once.

3307
02:21:15,690 --> 02:21:16,830
And uh,
the,

3308
02:21:16,831 --> 02:21:18,360
uh,
the guy was holding pads for him and I

3309
02:21:18,361 --> 02:21:19,680
was like,
oh my God.

3310
02:21:20,070 --> 02:21:21,780
Like watching him hit pads.
I was like,

3311
02:21:21,781 --> 02:21:23,880
fucking craill male.
He's never going to get it.

3312
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:29,400
It's like his body did not grow,
exploding like that.

3313
02:21:29,511 --> 02:21:32,850
Yeah.
His body moved slow and it was labored.

3314
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:37,290
It was like me trying to write a fucking
book with my left hand.

3315
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:41,820
It was like awkward and
he just couldn't do it.

3316
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:43,710
And I remember thinking like,
wow,

3317
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:44,850
okay.
Like these,

3318
02:21:45,030 --> 02:21:46,680
there's just,
they're just not there.

3319
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:47,320
Is this him?

3320
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:50,190
Yeah.
I mean that you can tell us a white belt

3321
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:52,090
who is trained a bit,
you know,

3322
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:53,710
it's not too bad.
That's all right.

3323
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:55,960
Well,
but,

3324
02:21:55,961 --> 02:21:57,850
uh,
even the white belt for life thing,

3325
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:01,120
that,
that smells of being,

3326
02:22:01,121 --> 02:22:03,460
trying not to be,
you know,

3327
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:05,470
us as he's a white belt for life.
He,

3328
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:06,280
you,
it,

3329
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:09,370
it,
it reeks of not being judged and

3330
02:22:09,610 --> 02:22:11,510
fighting is not a place you want to not
be jealous.

3331
02:22:11,530 --> 02:22:13,060
You're not bad.
Not Bad.

3332
02:22:13,061 --> 02:22:16,060
This movement is not bad,
but he's training with Henry Gracie,

3333
02:22:16,090 --> 02:22:18,170
by the way,
who's just a fucking wizard and an

3334
02:22:18,310 --> 02:22:20,110
awesome instructor.
Okay.

3335
02:22:20,111 --> 02:22:23,440
That's bullshit.
And it was space as he pushed that off

3336
02:22:23,441 --> 02:22:24,274
too.
Yeah.

3337
02:22:24,340 --> 02:22:25,110
But you know,
it's,

3338
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:29,130
hey man,
if this guy was still wrestling and he

3339
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:31,050
loved fighting,
was talking about,

3340
02:22:31,051 --> 02:22:34,590
was fighting on a small scale but to
stuff a lot and he had a great fight.

3341
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:37,110
It was a really good fight for a guy
who's only been training for a while

3342
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:38,120
and that's the way to do it.
Yeah.

3343
02:22:38,121 --> 02:22:41,330
That's the way to do it.
Find somebody who's like at your level.

3344
02:22:41,690 --> 02:22:45,170
The other thing that's really bummed me
out is that he just got it back surgery

3345
02:22:45,610 --> 02:22:48,170
and back surgery.
His fucking trickiest shit,

3346
02:22:48,171 --> 02:22:50,480
man.
They start chewing away at those discs.

3347
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:53,090
There's other ways to handle that.
I don't know how bad it was,

3348
02:22:53,091 --> 02:22:58,091
but the guy was walking around and Matt
Brown had a good conversation about that

3349
02:22:58,431 --> 02:23:01,010
recently.
I was reading some of the things that

3350
02:23:01,011 --> 02:23:03,860
Matt Brown said about his own bulging
discs because he didn't have to get

3351
02:23:03,861 --> 02:23:05,720
surgery.
He rehabilitated it,

3352
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:10,850
but he does a lot of work down at
Westside barbell with Louie Simmons who

3353
02:23:10,851 --> 02:23:13,820
created the reverse hyper a machine that
we have in the back here.

3354
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:17,030
And I bought,
I bought one specifically because I knew

3355
02:23:17,031 --> 02:23:19,880
that Louis had designed it because they
were trying to get him to have back

3356
02:23:19,881 --> 02:23:21,830
surgery and he wasn't buying it and he
was like,

3357
02:23:21,831 --> 02:23:24,530
there's gotta be a way,
if there was a way to compress the disc

3358
02:23:24,531 --> 02:23:27,770
to make it bulge out like that,
there's gotta be a way to decompress the

3359
02:23:27,771 --> 02:23:29,540
disk actively and strengthen the area.

3360
02:23:29,630 --> 02:23:32,690
So He created that reverse hyper machine
and you know,

3361
02:23:32,930 --> 02:23:37,310
to see this guy go straight to back
surgery like that when just a few days

3362
02:23:37,311 --> 02:23:39,760
before that he was standing there
talking to that Micky Gall kid and

3363
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:40,900
Areola.
Yeah.

3364
02:23:40,910 --> 02:23:43,580
I mean what the fuck is going on man?
How are you getting surgery?

3365
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:45,710
You reviewed all the options.

3366
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:46,700
Well that,
and uh,

3367
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:50,840
you know what he was saying to area,
I want to fight on either one 99 or 200

3368
02:23:50,841 --> 02:23:53,540
I hope I got the juice to find out 200
which is crazy.

3369
02:23:53,541 --> 02:23:55,490
You don't,
you shouldn't have any juice regardless

3370
02:23:55,491 --> 02:23:59,610
of our famous your juice meaning yeah,
I guess I dunno,

3371
02:24:00,220 --> 02:24:03,440
but I are you lying to Ariel then cause
you knew you were having back surgery or

3372
02:24:03,441 --> 02:24:06,200
you're lying now that it was weeks
before you saw this guy fight.

3373
02:24:06,450 --> 02:24:08,480
But regardless,
I want to pick on the guy because I

3374
02:24:08,690 --> 02:24:13,550
understand his motivation,
but I think if somebody asks my opinion

3375
02:24:13,610 --> 02:24:15,410
if his,
he was my friend and he said,

3376
02:24:15,411 --> 02:24:16,820
why do you think I should do?
I'd be like,

3377
02:24:16,970 --> 02:24:20,210
why don't you come out and have a long
interest in conversation with somebody.

3378
02:24:20,211 --> 02:24:22,130
Somebody know Ariel's his friend and
say,

3379
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:24,910
listen,
I went and I explored this for a long

3380
02:24:24,911 --> 02:24:25,250
time.

3381
02:24:25,250 --> 02:24:27,470
I found,
I found some incredible things in

3382
02:24:27,471 --> 02:24:28,640
fighting.
It gave me this,

3383
02:24:28,641 --> 02:24:32,420
I learned this stuff and what I
discovered was there's no way I could

3384
02:24:32,421 --> 02:24:33,470
fight.
That's crazy.

3385
02:24:33,471 --> 02:24:37,280
It would have been an insult to fighting
and I learned enough to know it and now

3386
02:24:37,281 --> 02:24:38,810
that I love it,
I want to work for the UFC.

3387
02:24:38,811 --> 02:24:40,760
I want to do some other things.
I want to contribute.

3388
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:43,640
People would look and go honesty,
right.

3389
02:24:43,641 --> 02:24:45,890
That's one of those things we never see.
It's so refreshing.

3390
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:48,590
Just come out and say,
I s I trained my ass off,

3391
02:24:48,591 --> 02:24:52,040
but what I found was only a further
appreciation for fucking everybody in

3392
02:24:52,041 --> 02:24:56,480
this gym and all these fighters and I
learned enough to barely to understand

3393
02:24:56,481 --> 02:24:57,950
that I barely know anything about
fighting,

3394
02:24:58,070 --> 02:25:00,350
but now that I love it,
I want to do some other stuff and

3395
02:25:00,351 --> 02:25:01,400
fighting,
we'd all probably go,

3396
02:25:01,401 --> 02:25:02,390
cool,
that's great.

3397
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:03,290
That's what he should do.

3398
02:25:03,560 --> 02:25:06,650
I don't think he can't fight.
I think he definitely could fight.

3399
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:10,940
I don't think that a year is nearly
enough time to fight in the UFC.

3400
02:25:10,941 --> 02:25:14,780
I think that's preposterous,
but I think anybody could fight at a

3401
02:25:14,781 --> 02:25:18,500
commensurate level of,
you could find someone who is at your

3402
02:25:18,501 --> 02:25:21,710
level has been training as well as long
as you have and have an amateur fight.

3403
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:24,190
There's absolutely nothing wrong with
not

3404
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:28,380
being the best in the world are not
being at a world championship or a world

3405
02:25:28,381 --> 02:25:29,770
class,
UFC level.

3406
02:25:29,771 --> 02:25:31,180
There's nothing wrong with that.
No,

3407
02:25:31,181 --> 02:25:32,410
no.
Nothing at all.

3408
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:36,280
When insults a lot of peoples that he
jumped right into the UFC and he did so

3409
02:25:36,281 --> 02:25:39,750
because,
not just because like he's notoriety,

3410
02:25:39,810 --> 02:25:41,800
he has notoriety and when he was
younger,

3411
02:25:41,801 --> 02:25:44,260
he was a boxing champion or a wrestling
champion.

3412
02:25:44,261 --> 02:25:47,230
Like brock was NCAA national champion.
I mean,

3413
02:25:47,231 --> 02:25:48,910
you got to look at brock and go,
hey man,

3414
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:50,440
you know,
maybe the guy can actually do it.

3415
02:25:51,250 --> 02:25:52,150
Him,
you're like,

3416
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:55,030
you never wrestled in high school.
You never wrestled in college.

3417
02:25:55,210 --> 02:25:57,370
You,
you're a white belt in Jujitsu.

3418
02:25:57,580 --> 02:25:58,920
You're a white belt in.
Like,

3419
02:25:58,930 --> 02:26:01,630
what are you in karate?
What do you and [inaudible] and,

3420
02:26:01,631 --> 02:26:04,810
and to not strike until you sign a
contract.

3421
02:26:04,930 --> 02:26:08,500
That to me is insane.
You're having a conversation about maybe

3422
02:26:08,501 --> 02:26:10,690
fighting in the UFC in two years.

3423
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:12,940
You start training yesterday.
You don't wait.

3424
02:26:12,941 --> 02:26:15,700
And then figuring out what gene de Juan
a trading striking,

3425
02:26:15,730 --> 02:26:19,120
that's insanity.
Know went to the right place.

3426
02:26:19,140 --> 02:26:21,610
Yeah.
Duke's amazing and such a wonderful,

3427
02:26:21,880 --> 02:26:24,790
this is the shit.
I mean that Jim is amazing.

3428
02:26:24,791 --> 02:26:29,791
He's got fantastic training there from
Daniel won delay to uh,

3429
02:26:30,190 --> 02:26:35,190
ben asked Fran to pedis to duke himself
who's just amazing,

3430
02:26:35,381 --> 02:26:38,590
coached Kush Scott Cushman and he's got
a great gym.

3431
02:26:38,591 --> 02:26:39,424
I mean,
did that,

3432
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:42,400
if I was thinking about fighting,
that would be one of the places that I

3433
02:26:42,401 --> 02:26:43,260
would consider.
Yeah,

3434
02:26:43,270 --> 02:26:46,140
he did the same thing that Tristar for
Rasa,

3435
02:26:46,150 --> 02:26:48,010
hobby alliance.
Um,

3436
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:51,640
matt human just got mad at him right on.
He's a fucking genius man.

3437
02:26:51,641 --> 02:26:54,820
He's got damn jeans and he's the most
low key of all of them.

3438
02:26:54,850 --> 02:26:56,670
You don't hear a peep out of that guy.
Timmy.

3439
02:26:56,740 --> 02:27:01,740
Tris and him are like symbiotic.
Like Demetrius is Matt Hume's cruise

3440
02:27:01,901 --> 02:27:04,000
around the world,
knows everything about fighting for

3441
02:27:04,001 --> 02:27:04,450
himself.

3442
02:27:04,450 --> 02:27:06,310
Research study,
loved the martial arts,

3443
02:27:06,311 --> 02:27:08,950
pursuing it,
looking for all the truths of martial

3444
02:27:08,951 --> 02:27:11,200
arts.
And along comes this super athlete and

3445
02:27:11,201 --> 02:27:12,730
he's like,
I'm going to invest a couple of years,

3446
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:14,530
see if he really,
oh shit.

3447
02:27:14,531 --> 02:27:17,710
He's really becoming his,
he learns incredibly well.

3448
02:27:17,711 --> 02:27:20,140
He's a good guy.
He's a smart person.

3449
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:22,480
Oh Shit.
Then once he gets to that level,

3450
02:27:22,481 --> 02:27:26,350
it's just like I'm going to commit my
life to making you the champion and

3451
02:27:26,351 --> 02:27:30,340
symbiotically Matt trains for them,
physically transferred them like he's

3452
02:27:30,341 --> 02:27:33,010
his training partner most of the time
and he's a fucking genius.

3453
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:36,820
That symbiotic one on one thing.
There isn't much of that in the in the

3454
02:27:36,821 --> 02:27:39,040
world.
There's not many fighters that have one

3455
02:27:39,041 --> 02:27:41,200
brilliant coach that commits most of
their time.

3456
02:27:41,350 --> 02:27:43,510
It's hard to find someone who's willing
to do that,

3457
02:27:43,511 --> 02:27:46,720
who and then forget about someone who
has the knowledge and the ability that

3458
02:27:46,721 --> 02:27:47,290
hume has.

3459
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:50,650
Cause he's not just a knowledgeable guy,
but he's very similar and for us as a

3460
02:27:50,651 --> 02:27:53,650
hobby and that he's not just incredibly
knowledgeable,

3461
02:27:53,830 --> 02:27:58,090
but he's also incredibly physically
capable of like for Ross is fucking

3462
02:27:58,091 --> 02:28:00,900
nasty.
He's got nasty kickboxing skills and

3463
02:28:00,901 --> 02:28:02,650
nasty Jujitsu.
I mean,

3464
02:28:02,651 --> 02:28:06,610
and his knowledge is very deep and wide
and I think the same thing can be said

3465
02:28:06,611 --> 02:28:09,490
of Matt Hume.
It's so rare to find a guy like those

3466
02:28:09,491 --> 02:28:13,870
two guys I admire for us and I liked him
very much and I just spoke with him the

3467
02:28:13,870 --> 02:28:16,750
other day.
On the phone before I went in to do the

3468
02:28:16,751 --> 02:28:18,810
Mcgregor won.
He was working on something with like,

3469
02:28:18,811 --> 02:28:20,710
I go and I love the man,
he's brilliant,

3470
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:21,980
but the,

3471
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,950
the one differences,
he's got 50 students so he,

3472
02:28:24,951 --> 02:28:28,040
and he makes them great and he gives
them real time and he dedicates himself

3473
02:28:28,041 --> 02:28:30,350
to them.
But this guy is basically one of a

3474
02:28:30,351 --> 02:28:35,351
handful and that is crazy.
But for us also seems to be that it's

3475
02:28:36,831 --> 02:28:38,840
such an interesting,
martial arts seems to have this

3476
02:28:38,841 --> 02:28:42,560
interesting path where you know,
you come along and you learn some moves

3477
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:46,070
and then you've learned how kind of,
how it works and then you do work on

3478
02:28:46,071 --> 02:28:49,910
your body and then you learn how to
learn and then you learn strategy and

3479
02:28:49,911 --> 02:28:53,000
then all these things growing.
Inevitably you end up at a mental thing.

3480
02:28:53,001 --> 02:28:56,120
And then philosophy,
the study of martial arts ends up

3481
02:28:56,121 --> 02:28:58,160
somewhere,
the study of philosophy,

3482
02:28:58,161 --> 02:28:59,840
how to live your life,
how to learn,

3483
02:28:59,841 --> 02:29:03,500
how to improve,
how to become better in being a human

3484
02:29:03,501 --> 02:29:05,060
being,
not just in kickboxing.

3485
02:29:05,061 --> 02:29:08,810
Like that inevitable result.
If you stay on the martial arts path

3486
02:29:08,811 --> 02:29:10,280
long enough,
inevitably you end up,

3487
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:13,250
how can I be a better person?
Like how can I get better at being a

3488
02:29:13,251 --> 02:29:14,980
human being and frost was there

3489
02:29:15,090 --> 02:29:18,330
that those things are part of what trips
people up.

3490
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:22,020
You know,
part of what trips you up in anything

3491
02:29:22,021 --> 02:29:27,021
you do is if you have personality flaws,
if you create problems in relationships

3492
02:29:28,050 --> 02:29:30,900
and in interrelationship conflict,
um,

3493
02:29:30,930 --> 02:29:34,500
problems with friends,
problem with a wife or girlfriend or

3494
02:29:34,501 --> 02:29:35,730
what have you,
those,

3495
02:29:35,731 --> 02:29:39,750
those things that make you a bad
neighbor will also make you a bad

3496
02:29:39,751 --> 02:29:43,380
fighter because they get in your way and
you realize you've created this

3497
02:29:43,381 --> 02:29:44,340
unnecessary Chi u,
you know,

3498
02:29:44,341 --> 02:29:47,430
yelled at your fucking neighbor for no
reason because it's dog shit in your

3499
02:29:47,431 --> 02:29:49,230
lawn or whatever the fuck it is.
Like you,

3500
02:29:49,231 --> 02:29:52,320
you created a problem that didn't need
to be there and now you've got,

3501
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:56,640
you've got extra friction and conflict
in your life that's unnecessary instead

3502
02:29:56,641 --> 02:30:01,020
of creating some sort of a positive bond
by being a really good person.

3503
02:30:01,021 --> 02:30:02,730
So you learn,
you know,

3504
02:30:02,731 --> 02:30:04,920
again,
no one's perfect but you learn somewhere

3505
02:30:04,921 --> 02:30:06,030
along those lines.

3506
02:30:06,210 --> 02:30:08,760
Okay.
I if I just approached this in a better,

3507
02:30:09,090 --> 02:30:10,590
more,
yeah,

3508
02:30:10,591 --> 02:30:12,780
more friendly,
more open,

3509
02:30:12,781 --> 02:30:15,240
more nice.
And then I get this positive reward out

3510
02:30:15,241 --> 02:30:17,310
of that.
And then I realized that's the path.

3511
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:19,590
The Path is to try to be a better
person.

3512
02:30:19,770 --> 02:30:21,690
The Path is to try to have more
character.

3513
02:30:21,870 --> 02:30:24,740
The Path has tried to be a better friend
to be a,

3514
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:25,580
you know,
a,

3515
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:27,960
a better training partner.
You know,

3516
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:33,120
to make sure that you are pushing your
friend towards victory.

3517
02:30:33,121 --> 02:30:35,850
You're not trying to kick his ass cause
you know he's tired.

3518
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:39,900
You know that that's a real issue in
Jim's right when they'd run a gauntlet,

3519
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:42,000
having a guy that is going to wear you
out,

3520
02:30:42,001 --> 02:30:45,630
but it's not going to fuck you up
because he knows he can because he knows

3521
02:30:45,631 --> 02:30:47,520
you're tired because you just ran with
three other guys.

3522
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:52,830
One thing you should drive me crazy
where I would be training and I would be

3523
02:30:52,831 --> 02:30:56,280
exhausted and I would just see a guy
sitting down waiting,

3524
02:30:56,430 --> 02:30:59,880
taking the time off of training,
not training that round.

3525
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:03,030
And then as soon as this round is done,
he tries to jump on you.

3526
02:31:03,670 --> 02:31:05,850
You just sitting down.
Why were you just sitting down?

3527
02:31:06,010 --> 02:31:07,380
And I'll call them out.
I'd go,

3528
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:08,910
what are you doing?
You want to rest?

3529
02:31:08,911 --> 02:31:12,540
And then you want to jump in while
you're fresh and other people are tired.

3530
02:31:12,541 --> 02:31:13,380
Fuck off man.

3531
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:14,383
For sure.
Yeah.

3532
02:31:14,390 --> 02:31:18,590
I remember sparring with a guy and after
I looked he was wearing like novelty

3533
02:31:18,591 --> 02:31:20,620
boxing gloves.
Like everybody showed up to spine.

3534
02:31:20,650 --> 02:31:21,900
He had a little like,
and it's like,

3535
02:31:21,901 --> 02:31:25,200
are you out of your fucking mind?
Like you're looking for an edge over

3536
02:31:25,201 --> 02:31:26,820
people you're working with.
You know,

3537
02:31:26,821 --> 02:31:29,160
it's so strange.
But uh,

3538
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,360
those guys are almost always not good.
Yeah.

3539
02:31:31,410 --> 02:31:33,400
But sometimes good enough to hurt you.
Yeah.

3540
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:36,270
There's this guy that I used to,
I love working with.

3541
02:31:36,271 --> 02:31:39,210
I just really like,
there's a lot of the guys in Canada that

3542
02:31:39,211 --> 02:31:41,700
kind of end up being like,
ah,

3543
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:45,930
I kind of get to admire them over time
because they were pioneers and maybe

3544
02:31:45,931 --> 02:31:48,870
some of them weren't even in the UFC,
some of them got their Claude Patrick,

3545
02:31:48,871 --> 02:31:51,870
Sean Pearson,
some of those guys who were important,

3546
02:31:51,871 --> 02:31:54,090
Canadian pioneers,
harmonic and,

3547
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:56,220
and Pat [inaudible],
all those guys.

3548
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:59,340
Joe Dirksen who was a quilt.
You admire those guys.

3549
02:31:59,341 --> 02:32:01,860
One of them,
he never got to the UFC and he's in his

3550
02:32:02,190 --> 02:32:03,900
probably close to 40 now.
Adrian wooly,

3551
02:32:03,901 --> 02:32:06,390
and he was like the best one 25 are
going.

3552
02:32:06,630 --> 02:32:08,430
And when I would go and I had a fight
coming up,

3553
02:32:08,460 --> 02:32:12,780
I wanted some rounds with Willie and the
reason I wanted them was one,

3554
02:32:12,781 --> 02:32:14,790
he would push you really hard,
but two,

3555
02:32:14,910 --> 02:32:18,860
he hurt me one time and he's very
aggressive and he hurt me one time and

3556
02:32:18,861 --> 02:32:20,820
my leg wobbled and the,
as I circled,

3557
02:32:20,821 --> 02:32:24,330
I saw him take the time to let me
recover.

3558
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:27,060
And that's literally the perfect
training partner.

3559
02:32:27,061 --> 02:32:30,930
You want him to push you so hard as
close to a fight as you can handle right

3560
02:32:30,931 --> 02:32:34,900
now and understand what you can handle
but not take you past that point.

3561
02:32:34,901 --> 02:32:35,950
And what,
yeah,

3562
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:39,780
and he was literally,
and he was ornery and aggressive,

3563
02:32:39,781 --> 02:32:43,710
but I loved having him in the rotation
in the last week of your four or five or

3564
02:32:43,711 --> 02:32:45,600
a couple of weeks of real training
before a fight.

3565
02:32:45,980 --> 02:32:48,810
Not because of that.
There's just like training,

3566
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:50,910
training partners.
Some gyms have,

3567
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:53,400
Tristar has some guys they don't fight,
but man,

3568
02:32:53,401 --> 02:32:56,280
they're a huge important ingredient to
every one of those fighters.

3569
02:32:56,990 --> 02:32:59,350
You know,
you were talking about you're getting

3570
02:32:59,351 --> 02:33:04,310
that concussion and Jordan means what
happened with me and he just retired a

3571
02:33:04,370 --> 02:33:05,270
really young,
yeah.

3572
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:10,370
You know his dad just fought recently.
His Dad's like 45 just enormous and one

3573
02:33:10,771 --> 02:33:13,980
and his dad is a cool dude.
I don't know exactly.

3574
02:33:14,130 --> 02:33:16,780
We talked to Jordan after,
he's like 20 feet.

3575
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,430
Yeah,
he's got like 30 plus fights.

3576
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:22,520
He's fucking,
you super talented.

3577
02:33:22,530 --> 02:33:24,900
You see what he did to my pile,
you know what I mean?

3578
02:33:24,901 --> 02:33:26,370
My piles,
beryllium,

3579
02:33:26,430 --> 02:33:30,750
my piles are super fighter.
Tiago Alba's for he took that body kill.

3580
02:33:30,751 --> 02:33:32,330
Yeah.
Props to Tiago,

3581
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:36,130
figuring a way through that first round
and landing that body kick and taking

3582
02:33:36,131 --> 02:33:36,480
your out.

3583
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:40,620
But then for have me in retirement,
that was really shocking.

3584
02:33:40,650 --> 02:33:42,930
My,
I'm guessing so what I'm going to say is

3585
02:33:42,950 --> 02:33:43,840
into,
I know Jordan,

3586
02:33:43,870 --> 02:33:45,270
I like Jordan very,
very much.

3587
02:33:45,271 --> 02:33:47,340
His father and I are very good friends.
Uh,

3588
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:52,140
I'm guessing,
but there I picked up bits and pieces of

3589
02:33:52,141 --> 02:33:54,330
him kind of figuring out,
well,

3590
02:33:54,331 --> 02:33:58,530
I'll get paid real good money when I'm
kind of at the top.

3591
02:33:58,950 --> 02:34:00,000
And then it's like,
wait a second,

3592
02:34:00,001 --> 02:34:03,480
I'm fighting like top five guys.
I'm finding like Tiago El Vez level

3593
02:34:03,481 --> 02:34:04,830
guys,
I'm there.

3594
02:34:05,430 --> 02:34:09,420
Jordan wants to be rich and Jordan wants
to be successful in life in some of

3595
02:34:09,421 --> 02:34:11,430
those ways.
And at least he's told me that.

3596
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:14,820
And he didn't say anything about pay or
any of that stuff,

3597
02:34:14,970 --> 02:34:18,910
but it was like he was,
he's right the top and he's not becoming

3598
02:34:18,970 --> 02:34:21,860
wealthy enough for what he's doing.
That's my guests.

3599
02:34:22,170 --> 02:34:23,430
Uh,
and uh,

3600
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:26,740
he loves fighting,
but one day he loved other stuff too.

3601
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:27,521
He's like,
you know what,

3602
02:34:27,521 --> 02:34:29,620
I didn't again,
I'm guessing,

3603
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:31,060
but a guy like him was like,
you know,

3604
02:34:31,061 --> 02:34:34,840
I didn't have as much sex in high school
is a lot of other guys did because I was

3605
02:34:34,841 --> 02:34:35,950
training all the time.
You know,

3606
02:34:35,951 --> 02:34:38,680
I didn't go on fishing trips as much as
other guys because I was training all

3607
02:34:38,681 --> 02:34:39,370
the time.
You know,

3608
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:41,410
drinking beer on Saturdays is really
fun.

3609
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:44,170
Like all of those things happen.
You're 25,

3610
02:34:44,171 --> 02:34:45,010
you're like,
you know,

3611
02:34:45,130 --> 02:34:47,950
and man,
having the guts,

3612
02:34:48,130 --> 02:34:51,910
the smartness to identify and the guts
to quit something.

3613
02:34:52,330 --> 02:34:55,410
We all as a society think that like,
don't quit anything you driven.

3614
02:34:55,420 --> 02:34:58,720
You do go do it for life.
To really analytically look and go,

3615
02:34:58,990 --> 02:35:02,980
this will not give me what I want.
Even if I achieve the results I will

3616
02:35:02,981 --> 02:35:03,280
achieve.

3617
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:06,730
I don't want or are not enough for me.
So I will step away.

3618
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:09,910
I admire that like fucking,
um,

3619
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:13,210
uh,
rock bands and I'm trying to think of

3620
02:35:13,211 --> 02:35:15,550
somebody in particular aerosmith or
someone like that.

3621
02:35:15,710 --> 02:35:19,480
The fuck is this guy still doing?
Going up there playing it might love it,

3622
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:24,340
but why is he on American idol?
He needs to still be on tv or he needs

3623
02:35:24,341 --> 02:35:26,620
an audience or needs to be worshiped or
whatever.

3624
02:35:26,621 --> 02:35:28,270
You made all the money.
It made all the great records.

3625
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:30,850
Go and sit on a beach somewhere.
People who go,

3626
02:35:30,910 --> 02:35:32,110
you know,
I've done enough of this stuff.

3627
02:35:32,111 --> 02:35:34,780
I think I would move on to other stuff.
We should admire those people cause

3628
02:35:34,781 --> 02:35:35,710
they're really rare.

3629
02:35:35,820 --> 02:35:37,080
You know,
they are.

3630
02:35:37,110 --> 02:35:41,310
They are really rare.
This is me and was so salad to guide,

3631
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:41,931
you know,
uh,

3632
02:35:41,931 --> 02:35:44,850
another guy like that,
that vantage has Adlon Amaa Golf.

3633
02:35:44,910 --> 02:35:45,840
Yeah.
Right.

3634
02:35:45,990 --> 02:35:46,681
No.
Yeah.

3635
02:35:46,681 --> 02:35:51,510
I don't know what happened.
He became very religious and I heard

3636
02:35:51,511 --> 02:35:54,210
that he was going to be a,
I'd heard some rumors that he was going

3637
02:35:54,211 --> 02:35:56,200
to be a cleric or something like that.
Wow.

3638
02:35:56,270 --> 02:35:59,640
He was a pretty devout Muslim.
I don't know what happened,

3639
02:35:59,820 --> 02:36:01,590
but he was another guy and be like,
wow,

3640
02:36:01,650 --> 02:36:03,120
that guy was so talented.

3641
02:36:03,390 --> 02:36:06,150
I used to manage some UFC fighters a
couple all the way up.

3642
02:36:06,151 --> 02:36:10,050
So that was,
it was really to learn everything I

3643
02:36:10,051 --> 02:36:12,450
could do to learn any angle off fight or
manager,

3644
02:36:12,740 --> 02:36:14,610
if I could carry the bucket,
whatever I could do,

3645
02:36:14,611 --> 02:36:16,590
I want it to.
And I came across this guy,

3646
02:36:16,591 --> 02:36:18,000
nick dinny.
Do you ever remember him?

3647
02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:18,661
Yeah,
sure.

3648
02:36:18,661 --> 02:36:20,730
Yeah.
And I'm a managed nick can we got him to

3649
02:36:20,731 --> 02:36:21,570
the UFC?
Who is she?

3650
02:36:21,571 --> 02:36:24,030
We got sean shelby.
A fucking loved nick.

3651
02:36:24,090 --> 02:36:26,310
And you should,
if you go and watch his first fight or

3652
02:36:26,311 --> 02:36:29,080
as fights in the UFC,
he fought like a caveman.

3653
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:32,550
The guy has a master's degree in
biochemistry.

3654
02:36:32,551 --> 02:36:34,260
I think he's brilliant.
But when he fought,

3655
02:36:34,261 --> 02:36:38,750
he loved fighting like a caveman and he
retired because he said he is taking

3656
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:40,710
head trauma.
It didn't like it.

3657
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:41,760
Yeah.
And He uh,

3658
02:36:42,330 --> 02:36:44,760
he,
we talked about it and he talked with

3659
02:36:44,761 --> 02:36:45,594
other people about it.

3660
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:47,730
It's like,
could I fight different ways?

3661
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:50,550
Yes.
But he likes fighting like a caveman and

3662
02:36:50,551 --> 02:36:52,950
fighting like a caveman will result in
brain damage.

3663
02:36:53,310 --> 02:36:57,960
He got knocked out by Marlon Sandra and
pack a in a single queue.

3664
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:01,530
And then he said,
after he recovered from that,

3665
02:37:01,531 --> 02:37:02,191
when he said,
you know,

3666
02:37:02,191 --> 02:37:04,740
if I ever get another concussion,
I'm going to retire.

3667
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:06,520
And then after that,
uh,

3668
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:08,730
the last fight he had,
he had a broken orbital bone and he

3669
02:37:08,731 --> 02:37:12,210
thought,
why am I waiting until after I've

3670
02:37:12,211 --> 02:37:15,090
sustained the damage to step away?
Why am I giving,

3671
02:37:15,180 --> 02:37:18,140
saying it's okay to take one more large
amount of damage if I'm going to step

3672
02:37:18,141 --> 02:37:19,880
away and let's just go,
let's step away.

3673
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:21,260
You know,
um,

3674
02:37:21,290 --> 02:37:23,570
he's a brilliant guy,
one of the most interesting or cool guy.

3675
02:37:23,571 --> 02:37:26,310
I haven't talked to him in a while.
I'm gonna make sure that I to send a,

3676
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:28,280
give him a call or something.
He's such a brilliant guy,

3677
02:37:28,350 --> 02:37:29,280
very,
very smart guy.

3678
02:37:29,281 --> 02:37:32,730
And he's a guy who was using an example
of someone who's very wise and

3679
02:37:32,731 --> 02:37:37,380
recognizing the risk versus reward and
realizing the rewards not worth it

3680
02:37:37,381 --> 02:37:38,220
anymore.
I need to.

3681
02:37:38,310 --> 02:37:40,770
Yup.
And there's gonna come a time for all

3682
02:37:40,771 --> 02:37:42,630
these guys.
They have to decide like,

3683
02:37:42,631 --> 02:37:45,150
when is it over,
you know,

3684
02:37:45,151 --> 02:37:50,040
when we were talking about the pursuit,
like getting after something and being

3685
02:37:50,041 --> 02:37:52,350
obsessed with something and wanting
greatness.

3686
02:37:52,770 --> 02:37:57,770
There comes a time when that's no longer
in your mind and you're still on this

3687
02:37:57,841 --> 02:38:00,720
path because it's something you've
always done because you've been a

3688
02:38:00,721 --> 02:38:03,120
fighter for x amount of years.
And so this is what you're doing.

3689
02:38:03,121 --> 02:38:06,360
You're going into training camp,
but you don't have that fire inside you

3690
02:38:06,361 --> 02:38:09,690
like you did when you first started or
when you were improving or when you were

3691
02:38:09,691 --> 02:38:11,670
at your best and that's what you need to
stop.

3692
02:38:12,030 --> 02:38:12,721
Yeah.
The,

3693
02:38:12,721 --> 02:38:13,830
uh,
so hard for people.

3694
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:17,730
It's really hot at the,
one of the things I've heard before as

3695
02:38:17,940 --> 02:38:20,140
people will allow Paul,
Pauline Polyman,

3696
02:38:20,141 --> 02:38:21,960
the nausea,
I had never pronounced in there as well,

3697
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:24,660
who is actually a brilliant commentator.
Very,

3698
02:38:24,661 --> 02:38:29,170
very fucking love listening to his car.
He's one of my favorites in box of area.

3699
02:38:29,860 --> 02:38:30,661
Um,
he,

3700
02:38:30,661 --> 02:38:33,090
uh,
wrote an article about how his passion

3701
02:38:33,091 --> 02:38:35,910
and desire to get back to fighting and
everyone told him he shouldn't,

3702
02:38:35,911 --> 02:38:40,911
but it's just enemy needs that that
cannot be the motivating factor among

3703
02:38:41,101 --> 02:38:43,410
the reasons that it,
that's 100% true.

3704
02:38:43,411 --> 02:38:46,350
It can't be is cause when you're 60,
you're still going to have that.

3705
02:38:46,650 --> 02:38:50,400
That's never going to go away.
So that just having that does not mean

3706
02:38:50,401 --> 02:38:52,590
go fight cause you'll always have that

3707
02:38:53,370 --> 02:38:55,860
many pieces of a pie chart that you have
to have in place.

3708
02:38:56,040 --> 02:38:57,750
Yes.
But if you're going to have it your

3709
02:38:57,751 --> 02:38:59,790
whole life,
it's irrelevant whether you have it or

3710
02:38:59,791 --> 02:39:01,230
not.
Cause you know you'll have it and one

3711
02:39:01,231 --> 02:39:03,060
day you're going to have to retire even
though you have it.

3712
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:05,550
So that can't be a part of the decision

3713
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:06,381
process.
Thank you.

3714
02:39:06,381 --> 02:39:11,381
Probably didn't see that rocky movie
when a rocky was like 59 and he decided,

3715
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:13,400
you know,
just the,

3716
02:39:13,401 --> 02:39:15,190
the movie I'm gonna Fight.
Yeah,

3717
02:39:15,310 --> 02:39:16,250
I remember that.
Yeah.

3718
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:17,690
That was the one where,
um,

3719
02:39:18,110 --> 02:39:20,450
he was uh,
who the fuck did he,

3720
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:22,260
yeah,
I Tommy Gun.

3721
02:39:22,530 --> 02:39:23,141
No,
no,

3722
02:39:23,141 --> 02:39:23,451
no,
no.

3723
02:39:23,451 --> 02:39:24,650
It was after that I,
yeah,

3724
02:39:24,730 --> 02:39:28,610
it was it the one where he fought the
guy who knocked out Roy Jones Jr.

3725
02:39:28,670 --> 02:39:29,101
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3726
02:39:29,101 --> 02:39:30,220
yeah,
yeah.

3727
02:39:30,680 --> 02:39:32,420
Tarver magic man.
And uh,

3728
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:34,310
you know,
which was fucking ridiculous and

3729
02:39:34,311 --> 02:39:36,140
apparently got knocked out and training.
Yeah.

3730
02:39:36,170 --> 02:39:40,430
Training for that at like 60,
whatever the hell he was getting punched

3731
02:39:40,431 --> 02:39:41,570
in the face.
Mark Tarver

3732
02:39:41,790 --> 02:39:42,820
when were uh,
yeah,

3733
02:39:43,190 --> 02:39:45,660
insane.
When we're looking at Anderson Silva

3734
02:39:45,661 --> 02:39:49,020
fighting,
he has one of his very favorite fighters

3735
02:39:49,021 --> 02:39:51,630
is Roy Jones Jr and there it is.
Look at that.

3736
02:39:51,631 --> 02:39:54,660
Come on son.
What the fuck are we looking at?

3737
02:39:55,230 --> 02:39:58,770
That's insane.
It's like 70 years old and he looks 30

3738
02:39:58,930 --> 02:39:59,950
like,
yeah,

3739
02:39:59,951 --> 02:40:03,700
I mean it's amazing what testosterone
replacement therapy is done for them,

3740
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,780
but like,
um,

3741
02:40:05,410 --> 02:40:08,270
it's just the,
the fact that he could try to sell this,

3742
02:40:08,290 --> 02:40:11,200
just look at him.
He shredded incredible.

3743
02:40:11,530 --> 02:40:13,800
How old was he when he made us in his
fifties?

3744
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:16,560
I least?
Thousand six so 10 years ago.

3745
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:18,510
The least.
How old is he now?

3746
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:20,970
I'm not sure.
Let's find out how old he is now,

3747
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:24,690
because that would mean that he had to
be like 57 then.

3748
02:40:24,691 --> 02:40:27,120
I think if it's 67 next day,
nine now.

3749
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:30,440
Oh my God,
that's insane.

3750
02:40:30,520 --> 02:40:31,380
Science,
man.

3751
02:40:31,410 --> 02:40:33,250
That's science.
Jesus Christ.

3752
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:36,780
I love this.
This is so insane.

3753
02:40:36,990 --> 02:40:38,420
Yeah.
Let's try to say he's five [inaudible]

3754
02:40:38,421 --> 02:40:42,390
six I'm five eight I stood next to that
dude and maybe had lifts in his shoes,

3755
02:40:42,420 --> 02:40:43,650
but he's,
he's taller than me.

3756
02:40:44,140 --> 02:40:45,900
Yeah.
Everybody was to just pretend he's so

3757
02:40:45,901 --> 02:40:47,170
tiny.
That's some weird,

3758
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:49,380
weird thing that people do.
You know?

3759
02:40:49,381 --> 02:40:51,660
They always like try to pretend that
people are tinier than they are.

3760
02:40:53,020 --> 02:40:56,880
Like three feet tall.
I am five eight I don't wear lifts in my

3761
02:40:56,881 --> 02:40:58,260
shoes.
I never have.

3762
02:40:58,261 --> 02:41:02,790
I have terrible posture.
I'm short as fuck stood next to him.

3763
02:41:02,910 --> 02:41:07,770
He's bigger than I expected him to be.
What everybody says,

3764
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:10,380
I want to meet Tom Cruise because
everybody says these tiny too.

3765
02:41:10,650 --> 02:41:15,270
He might not be tiny.
I don't know why that would be something

3766
02:41:15,271 --> 02:41:17,730
that people do,
but whatever where it's perceived as

3767
02:41:17,731 --> 02:41:21,660
undermining people just to love that
people love doing that.

3768
02:41:21,690 --> 02:41:24,150
They love doing that.
You realize you don't have to do that.

3769
02:41:24,151 --> 02:41:27,450
Like when you see people,
you know Ronda comes out and says that

3770
02:41:27,451 --> 02:41:29,520
she had a horrific experience and be
like,

3771
02:41:29,521 --> 02:41:30,360
yeah,
fuck her.

3772
02:41:30,361 --> 02:41:32,550
And then when you're like,
why are you reacting this way?

3773
02:41:32,551 --> 02:41:34,050
They're like,
well she brought it on herself.

3774
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:36,270
But yeah,
but you're still choosing to have that

3775
02:41:36,271 --> 02:41:38,700
response.
You could easily have a different

3776
02:41:38,701 --> 02:41:40,920
response who could easily have a
different perspective.

3777
02:41:40,980 --> 02:41:44,610
But that's a long path to improvement
for an asshole.

3778
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:48,500
You're like trying to improve a troll
with one sentence that's like not going

3779
02:41:48,501 --> 02:41:49,334
to happen.

3780
02:41:49,650 --> 02:41:50,341
People also,
their,

3781
02:41:50,341 --> 02:41:53,400
their life sucks and they see someone
who's doing as good as she was doing

3782
02:41:53,401 --> 02:41:55,140
when she was on the top.
I mean,

3783
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:59,460
was it sports illustrated call to the
most dominant female athlete of all time

3784
02:41:59,461 --> 02:42:03,750
and you know,
there's just so much hype and fanfare.

3785
02:42:03,900 --> 02:42:06,930
And then also there's all the shitty
things that she was saying to her

3786
02:42:06,931 --> 02:42:10,580
opponents and the way she was talking to
them and they'll like the Misha tate

3787
02:42:10,581 --> 02:42:12,200
thing,
which he did the show with her and she

3788
02:42:12,201 --> 02:42:14,280
was,
and she would win the competitions.

3789
02:42:14,281 --> 02:42:15,210
You'd be like,
fuck you.

3790
02:42:15,211 --> 02:42:16,980
And after the she beat her,
she walked away.

3791
02:42:16,981 --> 02:42:21,570
When you shake her hand,
there was so much fuel for the haters,

3792
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:24,360
but it's so much.
Feels like you don't have a choice but

3793
02:42:24,361 --> 02:42:26,840
must hate like you do have of course,
of course.

3794
02:42:27,300 --> 02:42:29,490
I just feel like sometimes when we say
these things,

3795
02:42:29,491 --> 02:42:32,370
and I do it all the time,
I'm guilty of it as charged,

3796
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:35,370
but we're,
it's almost like you're yelling out into

3797
02:42:35,371 --> 02:42:36,204
the abyss.

3798
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:38,250
I guess.
I just,

3799
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:41,820
it all you can do is hope that you keep
offering up.

3800
02:42:41,821 --> 02:42:46,590
That there is another choice,
but we're also a binary culture.

3801
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:49,440
There was this article,
I read the Tinder Ization of America.

3802
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:50,371
We're here,
they've got a swipe.

3803
02:42:50,371 --> 02:42:51,020
Yes.
Yup.

3804
02:42:51,020 --> 02:42:52,950
Wanna fucker left.
Nope.

3805
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:55,470
Don't.
And that that thought process,

3806
02:42:55,471 --> 02:42:58,830
that binary process has actually
influenced how our culture,

3807
02:42:58,831 --> 02:43:01,270
thanks Rhonda Rousey,
uh,

3808
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:05,430
is either the greatest athlete ever or
she fucking sucks and she's terrible.

3809
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:08,340
She can lose and still be the greatest
athlete ever.

3810
02:43:08,341 --> 02:43:12,010
She can still be a 99 out of a hundred,
but we can't have that in our culture.

3811
02:43:12,011 --> 02:43:16,420
She's a left swipe or a right swipe and
people only want one or the other.

3812
02:43:16,421 --> 02:43:19,210
They won't.
There's gray areas in everything in the

3813
02:43:19,211 --> 02:43:21,130
world and the gray areas where the
beauty is,

3814
02:43:21,131 --> 02:43:24,010
it's where the interesting,
fascinating shit is and where our

3815
02:43:24,011 --> 02:43:26,920
culture is making it so that we don't
look there.

3816
02:43:27,190 --> 02:43:32,190
Because of that swipe though is why a
real winner like conor is so spectacular

3817
02:43:33,010 --> 02:43:37,420
because with the amount of scrutiny with
the amount of pressure that's on them to

3818
02:43:37,421 --> 02:43:41,190
still perform the way he did and when in
13 seconds by knockout,

3819
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:44,170
then you are the hero.
And then that's also why people were

3820
02:43:44,171 --> 02:43:46,420
shitting on.
Although after the fight so badly,

3821
02:43:46,450 --> 02:43:48,790
right.
Although it was the greatest pound for

3822
02:43:48,791 --> 02:43:50,020
pound,
now he's terrible.

3823
02:43:50,021 --> 02:43:52,120
No,
he's still among the greatest,

3824
02:43:52,121 --> 02:43:54,970
he had a life,
he had a decade of being the greatest.

3825
02:43:55,150 --> 02:43:58,870
Maybe he's now been surpassed by
somebody or had a long career,

3826
02:43:59,440 --> 02:44:01,180
a lot of damage.
Todd or damage.

3827
02:44:01,390 --> 02:44:04,690
Quite a lot of hard fights but plus the
gym wars.

3828
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:05,710
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3829
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:07,990
And you talk about how they trained back
then.

3830
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:10,180
He used to live in the gym,
probably train all day,

3831
02:44:10,181 --> 02:44:15,181
every day plus barn with any sour on a
regular basis.

3832
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:17,920
I mean sours like an all time k one.
Great.

3833
02:44:18,490 --> 02:44:20,490
By the way,
that was Carlos condit first kickbox

3834
02:44:20,491 --> 02:44:21,324
yeah,
I saw that.

3835
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:22,353
Yeah,
I saw that.

3836
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:26,470
He's got zero fights.
He falling out with a hundred fights.

3837
02:44:26,770 --> 02:44:29,290
Unbelievable.
I love to,

3838
02:44:29,291 --> 02:44:30,260
I,
I watched uh,

3839
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:33,100
much of that podcast that you did with
them and I mean I'm,

3840
02:44:33,250 --> 02:44:35,350
he is,
you were saying vandelay would be one of

3841
02:44:35,351 --> 02:44:38,250
your three favorites are at that those
things do change every time we would

3842
02:44:38,290 --> 02:44:39,700
talk,
we would have diff once thinking

3843
02:44:39,701 --> 02:44:41,630
differently,
but kindness is absolutely one of my

3844
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:45,700
absolutely tough guy.
That fifth round with lawler was just

3845
02:44:45,701 --> 02:44:47,620
insane.
I thought he won that fight.

3846
02:44:47,950 --> 02:44:50,170
It was a very close,
very close fight.

3847
02:44:50,260 --> 02:44:51,350
Very close fight.
Yeah.

3848
02:44:51,790 --> 02:44:52,670
That one.
Uh,

3849
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:55,780
yeah.
I mean what I thought was beautiful,

3850
02:44:56,290 --> 02:44:59,230
it didn't really fucking matter to him.
Like he was searched,

3851
02:44:59,231 --> 02:45:02,020
he was seeking that fight and he had
that fight.

3852
02:45:02,110 --> 02:45:06,670
And what three guys sitting at the side
think it doesn't take anything away from

3853
02:45:06,671 --> 02:45:11,230
the 25 minute brilliant experience that
he had that will affect him positively

3854
02:45:11,231 --> 02:45:12,960
for the rest of his life.
You know?

3855
02:45:12,970 --> 02:45:14,680
And what do you like to do it again?
Maybe,

3856
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:16,240
maybe not.
Maybe that was,

3857
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:17,800
you know,
I dunno man.

3858
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:19,840
I still only got a few more left in him
I think.

3859
02:45:19,841 --> 02:45:20,290
Yeah,
no,

3860
02:45:20,290 --> 02:45:23,710
I think Carlos is a really smart guy and
I think he's also got a lot of other

3861
02:45:23,711 --> 02:45:27,640
things that he could do with his life.
He's very intelligent and what made him

3862
02:45:27,641 --> 02:45:30,820
such a great fighter would make him
great at anything he chooses to do.

3863
02:45:31,090 --> 02:45:35,710
And I think he's got a realistic
perception of how much longer his body

3864
02:45:35,890 --> 02:45:38,440
can go through those kinds of training
camps and those kinds of fights.

3865
02:45:38,470 --> 02:45:41,500
Yeah,
I mean the sour,

3866
02:45:41,501 --> 02:45:42,334
what's this first?

3867
02:45:42,530 --> 02:45:44,290
She's saying that's the same.
I loved it.

3868
02:45:44,310 --> 02:45:44,891
Yeah,
I know.

3869
02:45:44,891 --> 02:45:45,790
I saw that.
He said,

3870
02:45:45,791 --> 02:45:47,950
you know,
it was such great experience for him.

3871
02:45:48,010 --> 02:45:48,850
Um,
he,

3872
02:45:48,851 --> 02:45:51,280
uh,
he gave me one of the great quotes when

3873
02:45:51,281 --> 02:45:54,550
I was trying to figure out more about
fighting it and it was actually relevant

3874
02:45:54,551 --> 02:45:56,590
to what we're saying about dominick Cruz
and you're talking about,

3875
02:45:56,620 --> 02:46:00,790
we showed the footwork drills and how he
moves and I asked conduct because he's

3876
02:46:00,791 --> 02:46:02,590
like that and he's very special,
you know.

3877
02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:04,360
And I said,
uh,

3878
02:46:04,390 --> 02:46:05,920
when you're doing that,
are you,

3879
02:46:05,921 --> 02:46:08,920
when you go into fight,
are you working with pre planned

3880
02:46:08,930 --> 02:46:10,010
sequences?
So you'll

3881
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:13,670
run sequence a twice or three times on
Robbie and when he starts reacting to

3882
02:46:13,671 --> 02:46:16,550
sequence a or tricking with sequence b,
are you running these things?

3883
02:46:16,551 --> 02:46:17,990
Are you improvising?
What's happening?

3884
02:46:17,991 --> 02:46:19,880
And the way he put it was brilliant.
He said,

3885
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:23,930
some of the time I'm reading the sheet
music and I'm just reading the sheet

3886
02:46:23,931 --> 02:46:26,570
music and playing it.
And other times I just go off on a solo

3887
02:46:26,571 --> 02:46:28,400
and I just yet,
and I just improvise.

3888
02:46:28,700 --> 02:46:33,700
And that and Stephen Thompson,
Mcgregor crews,

3889
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:37,580
holly,
that's what the best are doing there.

3890
02:46:37,581 --> 02:46:40,270
They have sheet music.
Sometimes some nights the sheet music is

3891
02:46:40,271 --> 02:46:41,810
going to be killer.
Everybody's going to apply it,

3892
02:46:41,811 --> 02:46:44,150
it's going to be fantastic.
Other Times you got to go off on some

3893
02:46:44,151 --> 02:46:46,910
crazy jazz odyssey to make it work.
And sometimes they're a bit of both.

3894
02:46:47,150 --> 02:46:50,510
Well that was a big thing with Anderson,
this recognizing where those patterns

3895
02:46:50,511 --> 02:46:53,570
were and being able to create something
in the moment.

3896
02:46:53,810 --> 02:46:54,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

3897
02:46:54,740 --> 02:46:56,420
What do you think about Anderson versus
bisping?

3898
02:46:56,900 --> 02:46:58,160
Um,
like I was saying,

3899
02:46:58,161 --> 02:47:01,190
Roy Jones Jr was one of his favorites
and you saw what happened to Roy Johnson

3900
02:47:01,191 --> 02:47:03,350
when he got all.
Certainly it will happen eventually.

3901
02:47:03,380 --> 02:47:06,920
Is it now or is it in a year or is it in
five years?

3902
02:47:06,921 --> 02:47:08,420
It's gonna happen.
Uh,

3903
02:47:08,570 --> 02:47:10,730
I'm,
I mean I,

3904
02:47:11,540 --> 02:47:15,470
I have,
I played a troll game with Anderson

3905
02:47:15,470 --> 02:47:17,280
Silva it and not with him,
but sure.

3906
02:47:17,281 --> 02:47:20,000
Dog used to ask for,
for predictions and I just picked

3907
02:47:20,001 --> 02:47:22,510
against Anderson on everyone because
everybody was picking at us.

3908
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:23,560
I thought it was funny,
right?

3909
02:47:23,660 --> 02:47:25,460
I mean,
Stephan Bonner is going to defeat

3910
02:47:25,461 --> 02:47:27,770
Anderson Silva and be considered the
greatest it was,

3911
02:47:27,830 --> 02:47:29,350
it was comedy,
right?

3912
02:47:29,560 --> 02:47:31,940
So people,
friends who know me or people who follow

3913
02:47:31,941 --> 02:47:33,020
our channel,
no,

3914
02:47:33,021 --> 02:47:34,040
that,
uh,

3915
02:47:34,220 --> 02:47:37,640
so when I say I think bisping's going to
when they think I'm just still playing

3916
02:47:37,641 --> 02:47:37,820
that.

3917
02:47:37,820 --> 02:47:41,030
But I do probably think that Andrew,
when we picked her Anderson Silva,

3918
02:47:41,210 --> 02:47:44,570
we're picturing him in there against
forest in the greatest moments.

3919
02:47:44,930 --> 02:47:49,520
And that's not what I expect him to be.
I don't expect him to be like that

3920
02:47:49,521 --> 02:47:52,160
anymore.
The fact that he was one of the greatest

3921
02:47:52,161 --> 02:47:55,160
fighters of all time,
it brilliant and beautiful to watch and

3922
02:47:55,161 --> 02:47:57,860
did incredible things.
That's not diminished in any way.

3923
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:00,290
What's fucked up is that wasn't that
long ago.

3924
02:48:00,770 --> 02:48:03,470
What's really crazy about him was
stephan bonner was like,

3925
02:48:03,471 --> 02:48:05,720
what was that,
2013 yeah,

3926
02:48:05,721 --> 02:48:07,310
12 or 13.
13.

3927
02:48:07,790 --> 02:48:11,720
So four years ago he was the wizard.
He was the greatest of all time.

3928
02:48:11,721 --> 02:48:14,840
Now he's barely hanging on.
It took a whole year off.

3929
02:48:14,841 --> 02:48:16,460
He fought Weidman,
broke his leg and a half,

3930
02:48:16,870 --> 02:48:18,770
took a whole year off.
Um,

3931
02:48:18,810 --> 02:48:23,810
we will also broke his leg and then
tested positive after the Diaz fight

3932
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:25,550
took that year off.

3933
02:48:25,550 --> 02:48:26,840
Exactly.
So He's,

3934
02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:29,300
you know,
he's in some weird place right now.

3935
02:48:29,420 --> 02:48:31,760
We don't know what his body's going to
be like.

3936
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,240
We don't know.
We me know bisping's accusing him to

3937
02:48:34,241 --> 02:48:37,100
taking steroids his whole career.
That could be partly games and shit for

3938
02:48:37,101 --> 02:48:39,160
he might know something.
I don't know.

3939
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:42,380
Uh,
all of those things hint to me,

3940
02:48:42,381 --> 02:48:46,130
point towards not expecting him to be as
best if he's not as best.

3941
02:48:46,131 --> 02:48:48,800
Michael Bisping is the most
underappreciated,

3942
02:48:49,010 --> 02:48:51,530
underrated and undervalued by his
opponents.

3943
02:48:51,531 --> 02:48:53,540
Tough,
fundamentally really good.

3944
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:57,140
He's not going anywhere.
He's got hard because smart punches,

3945
02:48:57,141 --> 02:48:59,750
not knockout punches,
but enough to make you aware.

3946
02:48:59,930 --> 02:49:02,450
Everything he does is intelligent,
well placed.

3947
02:49:02,480 --> 02:49:04,910
He can get emotional and that might be
something Andrew Anderson will want to

3948
02:49:04,911 --> 02:49:05,930
play with.
But,

3949
02:49:05,931 --> 02:49:07,500
uh,
but I mean,

3950
02:49:07,530 --> 02:49:07,980
I just

3951
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:10,770
don't,
I'm not imagining Anderson Silva from

3952
02:49:10,830 --> 02:49:13,170
his highlight reels.
I'm imagining a guy who had his leg

3953
02:49:13,171 --> 02:49:16,830
broken and half lost twice,
100% of the fights he's had since then,

3954
02:49:16,831 --> 02:49:18,960
which was the diaz fights.
He didn't have.

3955
02:49:18,961 --> 02:49:21,210
Brilliant performances,
so we haven't seen him have really a

3956
02:49:21,211 --> 02:49:25,020
brilliant performance since you Shan
Okami years back now.

3957
02:49:25,230 --> 02:49:27,600
Could he come out and be mind blowing?
That'd be amazing.

3958
02:49:27,960 --> 02:49:30,960
Yeah.
Well Boehner was his last year before.

3959
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:35,210
I guess I'm kind of undervalue shoe was
a spectacular tentacular so yeah,

3960
02:49:35,310 --> 02:49:39,480
and he had many of them and yeah,
and just cause I played picked against

3961
02:49:39,481 --> 02:49:42,300
them for a comedy.
I don't want my friends of ours where

3962
02:49:42,301 --> 02:49:43,950
people watch fighting were to think I
don't like Addison.

3963
02:49:43,951 --> 02:49:45,720
So he's 40 yeah,
exactly.

3964
02:49:45,750 --> 02:49:50,460
He's forties unless you're on some shit.
40 is 40 and it's hard to be on shit

3965
02:49:50,461 --> 02:49:52,590
now.
Almost impossible.

3966
02:49:52,830 --> 02:49:54,210
Almost impossible.
Listen,

3967
02:49:54,211 --> 02:49:55,620
Robin,
we ran out of time.

3968
02:49:55,621 --> 02:49:57,630
Those three hours ran through three
hours.

3969
02:49:57,631 --> 02:49:59,170
It's crazy.
We just Blah la La,

3970
02:49:59,180 --> 02:50:01,260
la,
la La and we did it.

3971
02:50:01,530 --> 02:50:02,880
Thanks brother.
We got to do this more often.

3972
02:50:02,881 --> 02:50:04,490
Yeah.
Let me know when you're in town and

3973
02:50:04,710 --> 02:50:08,790
we'll let me know when your breakdown of
conor Mcgregor and Hofeld Los Angeles

3974
02:50:08,791 --> 02:50:09,940
goes live.
I'll tweet it.

3975
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:11,430
We'll get it out to people.
Thanks brother.

3976
02:50:11,431 --> 02:50:12,870
Thank you brother.
Appreciate it very much.

3977
02:50:13,220 --> 02:50:16,110
All right folks.
See you guys on Sunday with the fight

3978
02:50:16,111 --> 02:50:17,160
companion.
Much love.

3979
02:50:17,161 --> 02:50:17,994
Bye Bye.

3980
02:50:23,060 --> 02:50:24,150
Okay.

3981
02:50:34,300 --> 02:50:34,360
Yeah.
