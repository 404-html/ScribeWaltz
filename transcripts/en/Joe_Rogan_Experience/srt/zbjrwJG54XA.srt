00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,130
Hello friends.
What the fuck's going on?

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,340
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you by

3
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:16,260
Squarespace. If you need a website and
you want to go make one on your own,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,530
good fucking luck to you.
That shits difficult son.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,410
You're going to have to get a program
going to have to learn it. Ooh,

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,290
maybe you're smarter than me.
Most likely you're smarter than me,

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,450
but for me that Shit's terrifying.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,870
But Squarespace makes
even a dummy like me,

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,600
capable of producing a fine website,

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,630
a real professional website with all
sorts of different styles to choose from

11
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:43,590
and you could set up an online store
really easily. Like within minutes,

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,670
Brian has done at least 20 websites
while we've done these commercials.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,533
It's that easy.

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,070
He just slaps when these bitches together
throws up a template and then boom,

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,830
there's a website.
It used to be really difficult.

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,820
We used to have to hire somebody is to
deal with some weird motherfucker just

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,630
probably is jerking off all day
and not working on your website.

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,101
He's probably like,

19
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:09,390
it takes a long time and we watch
just beaten off furiously all day.

20
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:11,730
That's all this asshole
does and you need him.

21
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:14,940
You need him to fix things and
when you need people to fix things,

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,440
guess what they don't like doing it.

to you by [inaudible] Dot com that's o.

47
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:51,470
N. N. I. T. People have been
asking me if the, uh, new, uh,

48
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,160
guerrilla kettle bells are still in stock.
I don't think they are. I'm not sure,

49
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,480
but I know they were almost sold out,

50
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,330
but I think that you can get them on
back order, but they're fucking bad ass.

51
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,500
We can't print them quick enough.
They're very exciting to own if you,

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,310
especially if you're a primate
obsessed idiot, like myself,

53
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,130
I'm a very happy when I worked out
with angry monkey and a angry gorilla

54
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,750
kettlebells, it's the shit and
the gorilla one's the new one.

55
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,100
It just came out 72 pounds stop right
now, isn't it? A stock? Yeah. Beautiful.

56
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,240
Good, excellent. Um, they're difficult
to keep around their, their, their fun.

57
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,830
And somebody actually said to me like,

58
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:31,750
what a move towards was no practical pitch
life is not practical. Okay. It's not,

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,530
it's definitely not practical to pay
extra to have a gorilla's face molded

60
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:40,120
perfectly and do a Kettlebell. Duh. I
want one and I don't even want to use it.

61
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,050
Yeah. I just want to have one. It's
just a fun aspect of life people. Okay.

62
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,270
Everything doesn't have to be practical.
And when it is,

63
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,860
does have to be practical, then it's that.
Okay. And that's okay too. Both are okay.

64
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,690
It's okay to have a big fucking angry
grill of face on your weightlifting

65
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,040
equipment.
You don't have to be all pragmatic.

66
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,220
You have to be one of those fucking weird
dudes and only works out in great gym

67
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:03,190
shorts either. You know, you could wear
a pink shirt every now and then, bro.

68
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,940
It's not going to kill you.
Okay, go ahead on it.com.

69
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,210
Check out all the strength
and conditioning and fitness
equipment that we have,

70
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:14,050
including workout videos.
But I'll say this and I always say this,

71
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,720
learn from someone who knows
what they're doing. Please.

72
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,650
Before you embark on any sort
of weight training, uh, program,

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,140
get a trainer and scrape
up the money and videotape.

74
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,950
If you can have the guy explain to you
how to do things and then pay attention

75
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:28,780
to form.
So most important thing,

76
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,770
the worst thing that can ever happen is
you take on some crazy exercise routine

77
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,200
and you fucking hurt yourself.
That shit sucks.

78
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,270
It sucks being injured and a lot of
injuries you can avoid with due diligence.

79
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,480
So please do that. Um, as far as a,

80
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:47,320

at.com, if you use a code name, Rogan,

82
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,890
Use a code name. Rogan. Abby
Martins here. Why waste any time?

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,340
Let's get, let's get
busy. Let's rock and roll.

84
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,620
I want what seems cliche balls for my
door. Exactly. It's an awesome doorstop.

85
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,450
Cuban music.
I'm trying.

86
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,410
Good job. Logan experience.
What are you doing?

87
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,283
I don't know.

88
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
Was that an accident? That was
an accident. Oops. Sorry folks.

89
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,930
You know what the fuck's
happening? Yeah, it's confusing.

90
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,120
It's confusing to us to be Martin, thank
you for coming and you for inviting me,

91
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:28,300
man.

92
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,920
I did not know Abby Martin as an artist
and she gave me is fucking bad ass dope

93
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,490
picture that she has created.
It's very sexy. It is. Um,

94
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,420
it's very pornographic.
Can I say pornographic?

95
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,850
If I was like one of those
radical ministered type dudes,

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,930
I would say it's pornographic. Of course
there's some. Uh, thank you. So awesome.

97
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,190
I didn't know that you are an artist.
Yeah.

98
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,170
You're a person who main
towns indeed as as are you?

99
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,520
Hmm hmm to shea.
Are you in the porn who isn't?

100
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,440
I mean like, do you watch
it in a minute? Who isn't?

101
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,570
I'm sure there's a lot of people.
That's true.

102
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,850
I think a lot of people say
that they don't watch it,
but they're lying. Really. I,

103
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,113
I do watch porn.

104
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,820
I think there's, um, there's an idea that,

105
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,100
that people have with porn that
those people were being exploited.

106
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,230
That's the weird thing saying like,

107
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:19,660
you really shouldn't have videos
of you fucking on online like that,

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,090
that like doing that for a living,

109
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,580
the only people that are
doing it are being exploited.

110
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,160
But that gets down to a
really weird personal freedom
issue because there's some

111
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:31,950
people that actually want to do that.
So who's to say,

112
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,060
and it's a weird one because if people
like watching it and people want to do it,

113
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,700
like what's wrong with it? Like
what exactly is wrong? What's,

114
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:39,870
what is what is really wrong?

115
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,140
If people want to have sex but nobody
wants other people to watch what's real,

116
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,520
what does that really about?

117
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,500
Yeah, I mean, people
do want to do it. Yeah,

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,800
yeah, yeah. Well, it's, it's all,

119
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:56,030
it's weird when you tell someone
what they can and can't do.

120
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,630
It's weird because then it gets to
like, hmm, why can't you make a porn?

121
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,710
Why can't you like, what is
wrong with watching people?
Fuck, is there a, is it a,

122
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:07,280
is it dangerous? Like what's going
on and people getting harmed? Why?

123
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,140
How come everyone's watching it?

124
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,910
How come billions and billions
of people are watching it,

125
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:14,630
but we're still pretending that somehow
or another, it's like a negative forced,

126
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,620
it seems like, it seems like it's
like an integrated part of our world,

127
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,740
right? I think there's this
misconception about women, you know,

128
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,700
being forced to do what they're doing
and they're not enjoying themselves,

129
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:28,070
but really, uh, I don't think that's true.

130
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:31,580
And also I think a lot of porn watchers
are women a lot more than we think.

131
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,290
Wow. That's a strong statement. I agree
with her. Yeah. I totally agree. Well,

132
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:40,310
you both freaks should
be together. I think, uh,

133
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,220
I think it's probably
the majority of our men,

134
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,400
but I think more women probably watched
today than I've ever before. Right.

135
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,440
It's a strange thing.
You know,

136
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,000
the idea behind it is very strange that
it's such a taboo subject for people,

137
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,320
people that have, uh, that,
you know, we're living in a
sexually repressed society.

138
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,660
Oh, for sure. Yeah. And we're uniquely,

139
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:03,170
so it's uniquely so because of
all of our access to information,

140
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,160
we were still like sort of riding on
the ripples of the puritans at first

141
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:07,731
settled here.

142
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:12,731
Like the ripples of their way of
thinking as sort of a still to this day

143
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:16,400
influenced like a lot of the tone
and the country. It's very strange.

144
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:16,821
Yeah.

145
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:20,690
The entire entertainment industry just
sells sex because they know that it's

146
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,990
kind of this mystique for us because we
had been so sexually repressed for so

147
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:26,270
long. I mean, compared to other
countries, I guess Europe,

148
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,800
it's so fucking different.
I mean,

149
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,660
I was watching Braveheart on TV and they
blurt out people's acids when they're

150
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:33,441
moving the camera,

151
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:37,400
but then they show people's heads
being like beat up against the rock.

152
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,851
So it's like,

153
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,120
why are we able to see someone's brain
being smashed in but we can't see an ass.

154
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,250
Yeah. It's very weird.
It's weird how, you know,

155
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,580
you could have just incredible
violence in a movie and that's fine.

156
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,170
But it's the sex, we draw the line,
we draw a really distinct wine.

157
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,400
Do you remember if there was
a movie a while back called,

158
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,930
I think it was called Brown bunny.

159
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,920
It was Vincent Gallo and him and Chloe.

160
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,630
So you know,

161
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,430
that girl actually had
a sex scene in the film.

162
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,550
He can't play it because it's,
don't even try to play it Brian.

163
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:16,310
Cause it's actually sex. They,
they uh, they, she actually
gave him oral sex. Yeah.

164
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,380
And it was like,
and people got mad at him.

165
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,860
They were like furious that
they put that in the film.

166
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:28,010
Like I remember reading this like really
angry review by this guy and he was

167
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:33,621
actually angry at Gallo for doing
this and making him watch this scene,

168
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,670
this lewd act. But it's, it's a
fucking weird thing where we have,

169
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:41,610
where it's like, as a society,
like that is the line.

170
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,610
You do that behind closed doors.
You can,

171
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,240
you make out in a movie, you can
fake fuck, but no real fucking,

172
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,250
the weirdest thing to me is the softcore
porn. Yeah. That's fucking great.

173
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:58,770
How weird would it be this
to be a soft core porn actor?

174
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,380
I had a friend who did that did,
I had a friend that did that and uh,

175
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,680
him and his girl were like taken
it bed and you know, they're,

176
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:07,620
they're doing the scene together and
they're doing it for awhile. And uh,

177
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:10,860
in the middle of it she goes,
you can fuck me if you really want to.

178
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,130
And he goes, Nah, that's okay.

179
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,010
So he's just the guy to get paid way more.
If it was,

180
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,200
I don't know what his
motivation was, suspect didn't
want it's cocked to be seen,

181
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,510
but the, um, you know, the idea
behind it. So it's a very weird thing.

182
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,020
We were just like watching people
have sex. Yeah. But it's taboo. Right.

183
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,550
Billion dollar business. Right. But
it didn't. Not really. It's like,

184
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:43,551
it seems like the business
has been unfairly ignored
as far as like the economic

185
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:47,880
impact of the industry or on
the Internet on the industry.

186
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,570
Because if you look at the economic
impact of like on the music industry it's

187
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:55,770
really substantial illegal downloads. Like
really it was, it became a huge issue.

188
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:59,010
Right. But with pornography,
like no one talks about it.

189
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,730
No one cares who pays for porn. Exactly.
There's still websites where you know,

190
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,090
people would make money and there's,
there's so many people out there.

191
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,910
All the guy has to do is get fixated
on one girl and she, you know,

192
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,270
she just sticks still those inside of
her all week and she's making bank.

193
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,890
But the reality is it's like the,
the actual like buying of the DVDs,

194
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:21,330
just like a big thing for them and all
that went away and now they get like

195
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,250
paper view from like hotels and stuff.

196
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:26,550
But I'm sure that must be diminished by
the Internet as well since there's so

197
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:28,850
many other options. I don't know. It's,

198
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,650
it's illegitimate and it's
like treat it as illegitimate.

199
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,430
It's weird because it's,
it's unclear.

200
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:38,970
It's clearly a gigantic economic force,
like the need to beat off,

201
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,900
like it's gigantic, but yet it's
ignored as far as like, you know,

202
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:46,920
like if banks can fail, you
know, we have to prop them up.

203
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,220
If General Motors is going under, we
have to save them. We're saving jobs.

204
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,180
But if porn starts to go
on there, everybody's like,
man, but it was so inflated.

205
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,320
It was so inflated to begin with.
Really the porn industry,

206
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,530
people were getting paid ridiculous
amounts of money for just, you know,

207
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,540
like 10 minutes sex scenes.
What's wrong with that?

208
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,110
I don't think that's a bad
thing. I think, um, it's,

209
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,970
it's what the market allowed. I mean
though they were very valuable then,

210
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,780
but the digital aspect of their creations,
I sort of ones and Zeros,

211
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,990
it could be replicated at, you
know, for as long as they want.

212
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,560
That's where things get weird because
once you have that, it's like, oh,

213
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:28,180
well I don't have to make a copy of it.
So it's not like an actual DVD.

214
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,690
Like you could just download it
and you can get it in seconds.

215
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,220
That must have just crippled the business
cause you used to have to go buy a

216
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:40,000
physical DVD and if you wanted
porn that's how you got your porn.

217
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,680
Those like for the longest time there
was a store that I was to go to in Santa

218
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,770
Monica. It was this um, video
store. It was like half porn.

219
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,400
It was like they had a couple of fucking
like Braveheart or some shit. Like yeah,

220
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:54,070
here's Matt back. Stupid.
The most of it was porn.

221
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,810
This is like in the early nineties and
did you just be a bunch of dudes walking

222
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,240
around? They're shifty,
not breathing too heavy,

223
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:02,770
trying to get out of there
as quick as they could.

224
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,910
And then the rest of it was like a fucking
ghost town because nobody wants to go

225
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,110
to the one video store. That's mostly
best is when they have the rooms there.

226
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:13,130
It's like, do you really want to
support and starting to jerk off?

227
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,840
For some people they
have nowhere else to go.

228
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,870
For some people they
have nowhere else to go.

229
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,780
Also for some people they get their
freak on and doing something that's

230
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,270
forbidden in some weird CD way.

231
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,350
Like there's something about going to
a peep booth. It just excites people.

232
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,640
My friend and my, I had a friend who used
to smoke crack and go to a Pete booth.

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,880
That was his thing. He would
uh, he lived in New York,

234
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:40,870
he was a pool hustler and one of his fun
things to do would be a smoke crack and

235
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,030
go to peep booths.
So what does it peak like?

236
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,020
We just get like a glimpse of someone
dance. It's either one of two things,

237
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:49,170
I guess.
Some of them are like videos.

238
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,780
You can go and get to watch videos and
they would like watch videos and beat off.

239
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,030
And then the other ones
are like actual people.

240
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,270
Like people would be be like
behind glass and you know,

241
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,130
you would talk to them like you,

242
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,400
you walk in and they're sitting down
behind like a plexiglass thing and then

243
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,750
they do things for you.

244
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,740
Me and Eddie F went to that one place
in San Francisco and that's where I,

245
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,870
it was my first time where I touched
the walls and it was wet and, oh,

246
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:17,800
Jesus son. Yeah. Oh
yeah. It's dark in there.

247
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,550
You see the walls? Yeah. They got beads
and shit that you have to walk through.

248
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,320
It's fucking weird.

249
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,200
The whole idea is weird that you're
allowed to masturbate there though.

250
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,970
I start telling you
that. Right? They don't,

251
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,550
they can't really say
that that's what happens.

252
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,500
It's like one of those things where
they know you're going to beat off,

253
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:34,390
but they can't say, hey,
come on in and beat off.

254
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,820
Because then it becomes like a
public health issue. I think.

255
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,020
Like people just shooting fluids
all over the place. Yeah. It's like,

256
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,280
and not only that,

257
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,120
they don't just don't want to let you
know that you can do that. Just so just,

258
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,040
just to keep whatever,
you know,

259
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,320
like to keep people from
taking it to the next level.

260
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,080
Because if you tell people that they
can do it, then people, you know,

261
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,630
they'll like, well how come I
can't sell it? You know, they get,

262
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,410
you know what I mean? Like nobody's
like happy with the status quo.

263
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,940
They always want to continue to push it.

264
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,010
So if you tell people they
can beat off in there,

265
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,400
they're just probably going to be about
fucking each other and they're probably

266
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,050
going to go crazy.
They're going to do,

267
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,020
they want to get to want to have sex
there and then we tell them that's okay,

268
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,190
then they're going to want to kill people

269
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,540
that decline them. Porn at
least has raised the quality
of the prostitute though.

270
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,870
So we should just, you know,
think about that for a second.

271
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:22,980
Well that's another weird thing.

272
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,560
An article where a girl who was a,
uh,

273
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,660
it was a really very smart article about
a girl who used to be a porn star and

274
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:34,000
then became a prostitute.
And she was saying that it's just,

275
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:37,000
there's not much difference between
being on the set and being in a brothel.

276
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,730
You know, that it's just like,
there's no cameras where, you know,

277
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,330
just you're just having sex and sometimes
you don't want to have sex with that

278
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:46,030
person. You just do it because
that's your job. And I was like, wow,

279
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,260
it's weird that we like, that's a,
that's a real issue. Like you, you like,

280
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:52,360
you tell someone that someone's a
prostitute and that person's like,

281
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,800
oh my goodness,

282
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,800
you go there. There's that website
that lacks illegal. I mean, yeah, that,

283
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:02,250
that luxury companion website. Have you
ever heard of that? No. What's that?

284
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,780
Hi Claudi prostitute website. But the
sad thing is, is if you go through it,

285
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:09,990
it's all porn stars. Like you're all
like, man, I actually have sex with her.

286
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,090
That's crazy. Well that's a sweet deal
if you're a fan. Yeah. It's not like,

287
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:14,361
you know,

288
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:18,890
you could for $10,000 or $20,000 can
go play basketball with Michael Jordan.

289
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,840
And I was like, Bitch, I'm busy. But if
you're a fan of one of those gals finger,

290
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,870
the task had to be really weird to be
a dude is like super obsessed for the

291
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:32,810
girl. Wow. What a crazy chance.
It's one thing to meet strangers,

292
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,590
but to meet strangers who are sexually
obsessed with you and get to have sex

293
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:41,150
with you for money. Like that's a
strange energy exchange right there.

294
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,710
That's some high level shit

295
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,690
should do that too. Like my room
late John, why are we doing?

296
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:49,030
And we're like the shy ones like oh no

297
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,560
men. Yeah, well it's, it's
looked down upon in bolts.

298
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,550
As soon as is involved it's like
money and sex for some reason did not.

299
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,880
Anytime it's connected, whether it's
a Gigolo or whether it's a girl,

300
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:02,040
prostitutes like terrible.
It's awful.

301
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,610
Like you're connecting money and sex
money and everything else was cool.

302
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,530
You know,
money

303
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,570
dictation, sex to sell
everything. Yeah. Did you hear,

304
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:16,320
did you guys hear about that dude who
killed a prostitute and use the self

305
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:20,740
defense thing and he got off because
she stole money from him and she didn't,

306
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,180
she didn't actually fuck him.

307
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,050
So then he was able to get off on self
defense in some weird fucked up lawn.

308
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,400
It was like one of those stand your
ground things except I was like,

309
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,460
you stole my money and didn't
deliver the goods so I can kill you.

310
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,020
Oh my God. Wait a minute. What's David?
I want to say Texas, but I don't,

311
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,010
what's the story? How long ago was this
story? Just say, dude kills prostitute.

312
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,930
Oh my God. Gets articles are going to
get probably more more hits on Google.

313
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:50,580
Then baseball bat in the ass.
Guy Kills Prostitute

314
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,470
or baseball bat in the end gets off. I
went to, I went to look once just as,

315
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,330
because I didn't believe it was true.

316
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,470
Someone told me that there was a video
of a young girl with a baseball bat in

317
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:04,110
their rump and I went for the Google.
But when,

318
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,120
when you go for the Google search,
the numbers are insane. I'm going to,

319
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm going to do it. We'll see what the, a
recent one is. Baseball Bat and ass data.

320
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:17,250
Drm on our friend Dana. She's a sweetie.

321
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,250
Um, let's see how many hits.
Okay, you ready for this? Yeah.

322
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,830
5 million.
900,000 results.

323
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,540
Oh Geez. Wow. Okay, whoa. Knocking.

324
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:37,150
Choose images because the first photo
that comes up is the worst Croesus image

325
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:41,730
I've seen. Oh Dude. Jesus. What
the fuck is that? What is that?

326
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,960
Someone being rude, being rude.
I don't know. Let's say it's not,

327
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,823
let's hope it's not.

328
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,090
Okay.

329
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,530
Yikes. Yeah. Whoops. And then it's
like Todd's a rigid stuck in this Abby,

330
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,540
you fall or something immediately looking
at bedtime back in the ass because of

331
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:01,250
her painting when we started talking
about porn. Oh yeah, yeah, that's right.

332
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,020
It's your fault when you still look.
That was a playboy playboy from the,

333
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,350
like the 70s and sixties. Women
look pretty good today. No,

334
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,520
I just like everybody's good
natural boots. Yeah. Um,

335
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,500
more voluptuous.

336
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,760
I think they're going to have within our
lifetimes a different work around for

337
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:22,450
that and it'll be a biological
work around, they'll,

338
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,850
they'll have something where you
can actually grow a breast, your,

339
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:27,620
your breasts or grow larger. I really
think that's going to happen. Yeah.

340
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,030
I think there's going to be all sorts of
weird genetic changes over the next few

341
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,860
decades. The stuff that
they're working on right now.

342
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,740
[inaudible] I talked to Ray Kurzweil,

343
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,580
he told me that they're
working on artificial blood
cells that allow you to hold

344
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,560
your breath under water for four hours.

345
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,290
Okay,

346
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,560
sweet. So you could just hop in a
water, hop in a tank of water, ankle.

347
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,990
And because of these artificial blood
cells are so efficient that you would have

348
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:54,170
enough oxygen. We, you'd hold your
breath for four hours. That's like,

349
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,910
he thinks within our lifetime.
That's awesome. That's a
mind blowing fucking, yeah.

350
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,380
Yeah. So I think like boobs, it's
going to be an easy one. Yeah.

351
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,980
That's going to be easy. They're just
going to give you the boob bug. You know,

352
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:05,570
it's like a,
like a version of the flu.

353
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,350
You get sick and your tit scroll like
monsters. That's what's going to happen.

354
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,350
They're probably going to be no
ugly people in a hundred years.

355
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,090
Everyone's going to be super engineered,
genetic looking doctor Manhattan men,

356
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,660
and uh, every woman's going to be like
the perfect sexpot. They're gonna,

357
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,670
they're gonna have that down. There's
going to be no like, why would you do,

358
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,930
why would you have bad teeth when
you could just brush? You know,

359
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:29,780
it's going to be like that simple, right?
Like, did you go to the Jane Place?

360
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,580
What do you want to like trust, random
chance. And what your body's like,

361
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,560
are you fucking crazy?
You want to trust random chance.

362
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:40,130
I'm one of the most important things
is far as like social currency.

363
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,870
We all agree that like beautiful
people have like this amazing power.

364
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,040
They have an amazing power
to get people's, they have

365
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,050
like you meet at like a big tall, handsome
man with a perfect face and you just,

366
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,820
you just go, wow, he's here. Right?
You know, it's, it's totally metro.

367
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,600
It's a complete natural thing for human
beings to do, but it's fucking weird.

368
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:04,750
It's a lottery. And how much would that
fuck up with a social order though,

369
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:08,380
if everyone knows can throw it into the
toilet, it's going to be a goddamn mess.

370
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,310
We're going to not,

371
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,770
it's like how we bill are lazy because
we don't have to go chase quail to eat.

372
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,460
He just go to fucking Jack in the box and
get a chicken sandwich is fucking easy.

373
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:21,250
You'd take it takes three minutes
and it's already cooked. You know,

374
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:23,230
you give him some paper
and you're done with it,

375
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,940
but I think that it's going to
be much along the same line.

376
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:30,370
It's like we're lazy in that it
doesn't take much to get us fed.

377
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,130
So most people just sort
of skate by in life.

378
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:37,180
There's no like real desperation of
fear of not feeding in this country.

379
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:39,310
At least, you know, for
some people it's a struggle,

380
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:43,870
but one day it's going to get to the
point where that's the way it is with

381
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:46,690
everything it's going to be.
That's the way it is with your looks,

382
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,880
you're going to be able to just
look like whatever you want.

383
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,620
There's going to be people that
don't even look like people.

384
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,190
People are definitely going to
want to look like dinosaurs. Well,

385
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,590
people that are like
furries and shit like that.

386
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,730
If they could like genetically altered
humans to be like a dinosaur type person

387
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,080
and change your body and then
you have to eat goats and shit,

388
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,290
kill 'em with your face, people
would sign up. Yeah, no doubt. Right.

389
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,740
I'd probably be a huge counterculture
of does dinosaur Tucker's. Yes,

390
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,070
but I always thought it would be so
interesting like a thousand years from now

391
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,030
if the,
you know,

392
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:21,420
if we died off and then people in the
future came back and dissected our

393
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,420
skeletons and found remnants of like
silicon and they're like, what the fuck?

394
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:28,320
Where people just like inserting silicon
packets and their body and an APP

395
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,800
implants, you know that that exists
now. I can't imagine I have one of those

396
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,880
just getting like a shield just underneath
your skin cause you're like, ah,

397
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:39,480
I don't want to fucking try to do crunch.

398
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,040
Well I think it's a surgery.
Um, I might be wrong,

399
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,480
but I think what the APP thing is,

400
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:49,481
is they sort of like suture it in to
create permanent six pack indentations.

401
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,690
So it's like, just like I'm talking
shit, I've watched a special on it,

402
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:56,510
but it was barely paying attention
because I was like, do some crunches.

403
00:22:56,511 --> 00:23:00,050
You Lazy Bitch. Should I change the
channel? I was like, that's so ridiculous.

404
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,890
Fake Abs, right? Dudes get fake
calves have implants. Yeah. Yeah.

405
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,530
If you have skinny calves,
I guess.

406
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,950
I think I look at a man, I'm like
30 doesn't have big enough calves.

407
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,700
Well what happens?
I think with uh,

408
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,560
the bodybuilder type gentlemen is the
same thing that happens to anorexics.

409
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,460
I think it's been pretty much proven is
that they have a distorted opinion of

410
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:24,780
how they look. If some of
those big bodybuilder dudes,
they don't, they don't like,

411
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,830
they won't expose their body. They cover
it up. They have like blankets and shit.

412
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:32,310
They were everywhere and they were like
four or five sweaters. Like it's weird,

413
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:35,490
like they don't show their body,
they feel small.

414
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,590
They were a lot of layers sometimes.

415
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,190
And some of these guys are fucking
mountains, like human mountains,

416
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,470
but they're wearing like two sweatshirts
and a tee shirt over that. And you know,

417
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:48,590
it's almost like they want to like,
yeah, it's gay. They get crazy.

418
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,800
Some of them can get, and it's not all
of them obviously, but you can get crazy.

419
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,020
And so they look at their calves and look,
fuck deuce.

420
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,680
We should have a little cough. And then
just stuff, some shoe horns in there,

421
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,270
pop them bitches out. I mean, I don't know
who the first guy was. It went for it.

422
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,610
It was like,
I'm fucking tired of my fucking bullshit.

423
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,640
Like MTV special on it like 10 years ago,

424
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:12,210
this little like fucking squarely kid on
the beach. And then after it he's like,

425
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,010
everyone's looking at my
calves. It's like, yeah,

426
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:16,320
cause they look fucking huge
compared to the rest of your body.

427
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:20,010
Why is so have you seen this is donating.

428
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,060
People are getting donuts putting
their their head. Oh, I've seen that.

429
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:27,620
It's céline what it is.
Is it a weight? Yeah.

430
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,800
That's why they do it.
It's um, they pump of,

431
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,530
they actually inject saline into their
forehead and they like put like a little

432
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:37,100
indentation with her finger sticks.

433
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,410
People are so strange.

434
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,260
Some woman who was this beautiful
model and Korea and then she got,

435
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,360
she doesn't like her face with a
bunch of olive oil and ships couldn't,

436
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,320
they would not give her any more plastic
surgery. Now she looks insane. Yeah.

437
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:56,260
It was cooking oil. She was awful.
Injecting cooking oil interface.

438
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,990
Poor girl.
I know.

439
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,490
Yeah. The, the human mind
is so fucking complex.

440
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,160
It's so strange because it's like,

441
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,520
it seems like most of your life
is almost like a balancing act.

442
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,930
It's a balancing act of happiness
and friendships and laughter and

443
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:16,350
accomplishments and not losing
your mind along the way.

444
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,360
But for a lot of folks,

445
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,670
somewhere in that dance is just too much
and they just go towards lose your mind

446
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,060
at full steam ahead and then you're
sticking needles and cooking oil in their

447
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:28,950
face or we've all seen the,

448
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:33,510
the one actress that it will not stop
fucking with her face until they become

449
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,100
like almost like hideous
or, or, or pitiful.

450
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,750
You know when you look at them
you have pity like, oh no,

451
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:44,260
what did she do this thing to her face.
It's a very strange,

452
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,720
strange aspect of,

453
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:50,790
of the human beings had every now and
then you'd take what looks like a totally

454
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:54,570
normal person. He's like
keeping it together for a
long time. And then one day,

455
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,360
yeah I'll have to crazy town. Fuck
again. Tick Kiva together anymore.

456
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:03,510
I give up, I'm just fucking running. And
it's so fucking obvious too when they,

457
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,650
they overdo the plastic surgery
cause everyone just start,

458
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,370
it looks exactly like it's fucking,

459
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,270
well it's, it's, you know what it is.

460
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:11,220
You get delusional and you
think it's going to fix.

461
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,680
I had hair transplants
and I had my first one,

462
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:17,640
I think when I was like 26 I had three
of them. Why, why is still young?

463
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,940
Just cause, cause like my hair was
falling out. I was fucking freaking out.

464
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,390
I was freaking out when my hair was
falling out because I was on TV too and I

465
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:28,710
was making a living like as an actor at
the time on news radio. And I was like,

466
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,650
oh my God, my fucking hair is
falling out. I had new one,

467
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:34,080
it was falling out for a while.
I saved it though with the Minoxidil.

468
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,530
Minoxidil was hanging in there.
But after a while it was like,

469
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,050
it was still falling out. And I was like,
God, I got to do something about it.

470
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,580
I should have never done anything.

471
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:43,200
I should have shaved my
head from the beginning.

472
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,470
And so when ever kids ask me online like
dude's ask me, Oh fuck fucker, frequent,

473
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,120
oh Moyer and lose my hair, shave
it, bitch. Just deal with that.

474
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,570
Just just accept the fact you
don't have any hair looked bad.

475
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,430
It didn't look good Mike.
I never looked at my heroine.

476
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,460
It was always like, like, oh I guess
I got hair up there now, whatever.

477
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,460
But you know the way they do
it as like a single thing,

478
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,220
it's not like the old way of doing it,
but they take it big strip of hair.

479
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:11,790
So I have this like big
scar in the back of my head,

480
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,980
like a smile for the rest of my life.

481
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,120
But I'd rather have that like first
of all it's a good public service

482
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:20,580
announcement. Like if you thinking
about doing this, just look at my head,

483
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,940
don't do it. Just shave your head. And
then the other thing is that it, it's,

484
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,920
it's almost like what you're
doing is it's a screw ball thing.

485
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,260
Like it seems like it might work a little,
but then as you start doing it,

486
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,780
go why Wayne but isn't their options?
Is there another route that,

487
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,260
and the other option is just let it be
what the fuck it is and stop freaking out.

488
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,280
That's the other option.

489
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,860
There's always the best option rather
than getting knocked unconscious and they

490
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:48,960
take a chunk of meat out of the back
of your head and drill fucking holes in

491
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:52,270
there and implant those. It's
nuts. Oh yeah. Jason, what's his

492
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,900
name's Jason. Alex. Jason
Alexander, I think. Yeah,

493
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,130
he wanted to go back in
time just like yours.

494
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,440
So it kind of looked like
he was about to go bald.

495
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,390
See why would just make it more realistic.

496
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,750
Wow. Yeah, he got 'em. He got like
a super cool hairpiece I guess.

497
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,500
Yeah, it's kind of weird because like
it would chick wears a wig. It's like,

498
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,340
you know, no biggie. You know, like,

499
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,050
like when Madonna would
wear wigs or when lady Gaga,

500
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:20,980
I would wear some crazy wigs. Like nobody
tripped. But if a dude's wearing a wig,

501
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,740
well is that really a little too
far? Too Far? That's beautiful.

502
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,390
It's real. I would love it if
he did that. If he gave up on

503
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,470
dying his hair, like if imagine if
he was all white like that for real.

504
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,700
So he gives up on dying his hair and
then he just has a crazy white hair piece

505
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:43,360
goes for it. And like, I would actually
really sorcerer. Totally respect that.

506
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:46,960
Like a sorcerer. Michael
Bolt. Yeah. Hey whatever man.

507
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:49,090
That's what the dude wants to look like.
But for me,

508
00:28:49,091 --> 00:28:53,230
I can tell you that it was a big mistake
on my part and it was one that I made

509
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:57,130
and getting hair transplants out of
insecurity because I was young and I was,

510
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,110
you know, thinking like, oh,
I'm not going to have a career.

511
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:01,900
I'm going to be a bald loser. You
know, like that's what I was thinking.

512
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,730
That's a society drills into us.
And if you,

513
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,940
and if you want to have a solution
to something, you go research it.

514
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:10,420
And at the time it's
very little internet too,

515
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:13,450
so it wasn't as easy to research
things. But you know, you talk,

516
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,360
do you find like a doctor who does it
and you talk to them and they show you

517
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:20,770
photos and you're like, oh, this is going
to work. Oh boy, I'm going to fix my hair.

518
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,430
And then the next thing you know,
what am I doing this stupid fuck.

519
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,500
And I guarantee you probably most women
that one of doing something wrong,

520
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,130
whether it's a lip thing or a nose
thing where they're like, oh Christ.

521
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,610
And they look at it in the mirror and
they're like, what the fuck did I just do?

522
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,620
And then you could try to fix it.

523
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,310
Like I've heard of girls that have had
girls Gore all where that came from

524
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,730
corals than I've had too many nose jobs
and they have to get like cartilage

525
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:49,960
removed from, from the rib, and
then they recreate the nose. Yeah.

526
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:53,670
I talked to this guy that told me about
this operation that they had to do that

527
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:55,210
is,
she was in her 20s to,

528
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,210
she'd had too many nose jobs already and
she'd ruined her nose and her nose like

529
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,860
Jackson, dude. I mean, I know he's
a, yeah. Yeah. This girl had like,

530
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,490
well her nose apparently like started to
like go in after the bone and like it's

531
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,150
kind of sunk in because there wasn't any
cartilage there to support the rest of

532
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:13,984
the nose.

533
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,610
Ooh,

534
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,190
Ooh. Yeah. It's weird man. It's weird.

535
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,100
Some people just have bigger noses
and they just got to deal with that.

536
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,310
It's our righty. It's
going to be okay. You know,

537
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,730
I saw Michael Jackson impersonator on
Hollywood and vine last night with like a

538
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,710
little kid in a candy shop.
I was like,

539
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:33,390
this is a ridiculous
moment in time whose kid is

540
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,440
I also got robbed. You
got wrong. What happened?

541
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,730
I got like bum rushed by but like a crowd
and then they just must have lifted my

542
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:45,190
wallet right out of my purse.
It was crazy.

543
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,990
So they just ran into you and bumped
into your bag and you didn't notice it?

544
00:30:48,991 --> 00:30:49,450
Yeah,

545
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,950
and I was like,
how the fuck am I going to fly?

546
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:54,760
Apparently you don't need an ID to fly.
You just need to go. There were like,

547
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,880
we need to put you through
like 20 security tests.

548
00:30:56,881 --> 00:31:01,360
They'll come to the airport two hours
early. I was like, God dammit. Yeah, yeah.

549
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,500
Have you ever had that happen before
where you get like roughly frisky?

550
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,410
No, but I have, uh,

551
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,380
gotten yelled at by a TSA agent because
I didn't want to go through the body

552
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:13,390
scanner and he was like, what do
you, his celebrity? He's like,

553
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,270
only celebrities don't want to go
through the body scanner. And I was like,

554
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:19,450
why are you, I was like, this is crazy
that you're talking to me like this. Like,

555
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:23,200
what the fuck? This is nuts. It's
an option, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.

556
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:27,130
He was just like totally demeaning.
Mean I can in front of everyone and nuts.

557
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,690
Why would celebrities not
want to go through the new
ones? Like, it's like, yeah.

558
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:34,690
Why would you want to get molested?
I mean,

559
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,360
well, it's, I've never
had it happen to me.

560
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:41,530
Everyone has always been pleasant
with me. But, uh, Graham Hancock, uh,

561
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,080
who's been on the podcast several times,
he's a good friend.

562
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,470
He went through one and he said this dude
like just was aggressively sexual with

563
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:54,460
him, like grabbing his, his body. Like
it felt like he was being molested.

564
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,170
Like,
I shouldn't say aggressively sexual,

565
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:59,800
but he grabbed his cock and the
whole thing. I mean, like he said,

566
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:04,090
it felt like he was getting raped, like
obviously not as extreme, but you know,

567
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,890
it's,
it's like a form of a violation.

568
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08,170
And he was really shocked
by it and he wrote about it.

569
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,470
He was shocked enough that
he didn't just let it go.

570
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:11,470
He sat down and wrote some stuff.
Yeah.

571
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,580
Well there's this report that came out
that said that there's so many more cases

572
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:19,450
of malfeasance and misconduct and the
Tsa than any other government. I mean,

573
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:23,050
this is like 20 times more. And so there
was this investigation done to find out,

574
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:27,880
well, why is there so much fucking
like crimes happening? Like robbery,

575
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,040
um, sexual abuse and stuff. And it was,

576
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,460
and basically this representative
figured out that they don't really do

577
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:37,330
background checks. Oh my God. And they're
just kind of skipping through this huge,

578
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:40,890
uh, you know, you think that you
would, so basically they're hiring, uh,

579
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,640
pedophiles and child molesters.
What they found out. Yeah.

580
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:48,060
No. Well, yes. Well not nice people
too. Sure. We should say that.

581
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,880
I met a lot of really nice
people to Tsa and people.

582
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:55,440
You fucking government chill, relax.
No, I'm just saying I'm just trying to,

583
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,730
in the interest of fairness,

584
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,330
I know some of them are just folks that
needed a job and that's just the reality

585
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:03,330
of the situation. Graham Hancock
got molested. He'd do a little bit,

586
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,410
what are you going on?
It's a thing where I think that it,

587
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,910
it can be pretty well argued that there
needs to be some form of security,

588
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:17,090
but it's also a thing that is much like
many other public service jobs is that

589
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:20,810
it should be really respected and it
should be something you're paid well for.

590
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,770
It should be a difficult job to acquire.

591
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,120
And I think it's a matter of priorities
and if we shifted those priorities that

592
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:31,140
we could make a sizable change in
the way the whole thing is run.

593
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,400
If you made it so that people
were, first of all, it's made,

594
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:37,530
it made it so that those, those jobs are
a little bit more difficult to come by.

595
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,430
And that the people that do do a Dubai
get background checks and it's a really

596
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:44,750
good job to get with excellent benefits
so they don't feel left out of fucked or

597
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,220
disenfranchised. It's, it's
something that's worth,

598
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,760
and then so also worth adhering to a
certain code of conduct because it's a

599
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:54,150
really good job, you know, I think when
you have a John, but it's, you know,

600
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,420
yeah, get a frown. Just getting
paid like fucking minimum wage.

601
00:33:57,421 --> 00:34:01,170
I think we're a little more polished.
I think it's a use useless agency.

602
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,580
Well, how do you think
that you should do security

603
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,510
did before nine 11 how did that day was
totally created in the wake of nine 11

604
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:07,911
it's a total,

605
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:11,350
the new government agencies like the
Department of Homeland Security and just,

606
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:15,460
I mean, think about it, the
hijackers brought on what knives,

607
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,560
like you can still bring those in.
This guy,

608
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,600
Jonathan Corbet basically expose the
fact that you can just create an insulin

609
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,370
pocket and bringing to whatever the fuck
you want through these body scanners.

610
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,670
So they really have like a
huge security breach. So,

611
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:30,720
but when you go back to why the body
scans were implemented like an in sown

612
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:35,650
pocket that's like silver or
something. Oh, so it has to
be a sign. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,580
And you can carry anything
through. Oh Wow. Yeah. But I mean,

614
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:41,830
the reason that the body scanners
were implemented in the first place,

615
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,940
he says Michael, Michael Chertoff was, uh,

616
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,910
tied up with rape rapist scan, which is
also the name of the body scanner. Right.

617
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:51,920
Rapiscan rapid rapid scan,
but I call him, right.

618
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,520
[inaudible]

619
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,060
well it wasn't, I got a patent,
so Rapiscan I've got a patent,

620
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,030
I'm not changing the fucking
name because it adamant,

621
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,260
some crazy multimillionaire
guy who just was nuts. So yeah,

622
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,720
sky was, I was running the DHS and he, uh,

623
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,020
he was tied up with the lobbying firm
and profiting off these body scanners.

624
00:35:17,021 --> 00:35:20,230
And so they just put them in all the
airports and they don't even really work.

625
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,020
Even Israel,
the Israeli government was like,

626
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,330
we're not going to use those because
they don't work like they're not going to

627
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,800
stop terrorism. So they're
totally pointless. Uh,

628
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,890
it's just like a money making scam.

629
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,930
Wow. Yeah. Well, but here's
the question. Before nine 11,

630
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,340
they did something right that you
went to reddit radar detectors.

631
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,720
You went through just the regular
metal detectors. Right. And they still,

632
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,460
they x rayed your luggage. No, I
don't know. I think they did. Yeah.

633
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:50,210
I feel like they did. Didn't they seemed
like they did, but yeah, they did.

634
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,230
Um,

635
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,090
between then and now it's
just gotten more complicated.

636
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:57,050
Is that what the idea is?

637
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,330
Well, they just, you know,

638
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,920
they want to dehumanize us as much as
possible to make flying the worst fucking

639
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:04,810
thing in the world is,
and now I get to take off your shoes.

640
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:07,120
The liquid thing is completely absurd.

641
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,110
That was based on something that
was totally, it wasn't fake,

642
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:15,430
but it was like these mentally unstable
people who we're trying to mix liquid

643
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:18,400
explosives that it wasn't even going
to work. It was like totally pointless.

644
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:19,540
They weren't even able to do it.

645
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,960
So then they just punish everyone by
making everyone put little liquids in bags

646
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,790
and it's just ridic.

647
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,710
Maybe they found like proof of
concept after that that like yeah,

648
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:29,510
somebody could go on,

649
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,200
someone could ship who bottle full with
c four that looks like conditioner.

650
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:35,900
You can't bring snow gloves on.
Snow Globes.

651
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,550
I just saw that in a little shake.
Like a paperweight. I didn't.

652
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,670
I was there a snowglobe terrorist that I
miss. Like someone trying to listen to.

653
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:46,250
Someone was coming at me
and they were trying to get

654
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,900
crazy. I could fuck you up with a
snow globe. So imagine a pitcher,

655
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,130
a really good baseball pitcher and a
snow globe. Oh my God, you're a dead man.

656
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,560
It's going to kill you with that thing.
It can be used as a weapon,

657
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,130
but now the TSA is actually taking
it so fucking farm. And they,

658
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,260
I just saw this video where this
woman comes back from her trip,

659
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,710
she gets her car and there's a little
note in her car that says Tsa inspected

660
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:09,170
your car while you were
gone. She was like, what?

661
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,140
Apparently it's a local jurisdiction,

662
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,000
a thing they can the, the
local, uh, it's not a TSA thing.

663
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,430
It's a local security for the
parking lot. And the TSA, yeah,

664
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:26,050
in various districts I think has very
different ways of approaching these types

665
00:37:26,051 --> 00:37:27,560
of situations.
But if they choose to,

666
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:29,900
for some reason I think
it was like a valet car.

667
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:34,070
She valued her car and for whatever
reason they chose to see search it.

668
00:37:34,071 --> 00:37:37,640
But I don't think what they're
saying is this not a TSA policy?

669
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,460
I think that was the, the um,
um, the, the response to it,

670
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,540
but it wasn't TSA policy that it
was a local thing and someone did.

671
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,160
So it's not something they plan on doing,

672
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,250
but it could have been something they
were like testing the waters and then

673
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:49,810
people freak

674
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,643
cow and then they're like,

675
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,390
[inaudible] we have a sign up.

676
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:56,830
And she's like,
that sign wasn't here before.

677
00:37:56,831 --> 00:38:01,540
It's like we're going to really
inspect your car. Yeah. Oh Wow. Well,

678
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,100
I want to know who to believe their, that
gets weird. I wish I knew, but still,

679
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:09,610
even if there is a sign, if you're not
told, hey, we're going to search your car.

680
00:38:09,611 --> 00:38:12,940
I mean, it'd be real specific
about, can't just have a sign. Oh,

681
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:14,920
I might look through your shit.
You're like,

682
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:18,220
are you didn't read everything in this
entire office before you gave the Valet

683
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:21,490
Dude your keys. I'll might
steal your change. Sorry.

684
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,930
I will have to sign. Just so, I
mean, it's, it's grown so much.

685
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:28,790
It's such a waste of money.
I just think, I mean, what,

686
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,190
what have we done really with
the Tsa? Well, the, the argument

687
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,980
I would say, um, I don't disagree
with you, but argument, I would say

688
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,470
if I was, you know, doing
the counterpoint was like,

689
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:39,820
think of how many lives we've saved.

690
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,340
Think how many terrorist
attacks were stopped.

691
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,490
Thinking how many people did not try
things because they thought they would

692
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,650
never get through the infinite matrix.

693
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:52,651
That is the TSA line of integrity
in you're right then you're right,

694
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:55,420
it is hypothetical's but a
certain point in time, you know,

695
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,870
is it hypothetical that if you didn't
have vitamin C you would get scurvy?

696
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,130
See where I'm going with this? I'm
not going anywhere folks, blacks,

697
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,910
I don't believe a word I'm saying. Um,
I hear you. I know what you're saying,

698
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,090
but I think that there should probably
be some form of security just with the

699
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:17,620
reality of the world that we live in.
I don't fucking trust people that much.

700
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,940
I don't trust people to, I just feel
like if there was no security at all,

701
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,050
I would have to like have a
lot more faith in our society.

702
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,530
Go back to what it was before. It was
totally fine. What is it before though?

703
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,830
Do you know the specifics?
I don't know if it was like,

704
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:36,160
it wasn't a private contractor. I
mean, I think it was government agents,

705
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:37,600
but it was just very,
uh,

706
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,280
it wasn't like a huge multibillion
dollar wasteful agency that is just like,

707
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,970
is it this one of those things where,
and I'm obviously not a politician,

708
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:47,950
nor do I really even understand politics,

709
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,100
but is it one of those things where when
jobs get created and a business gets

710
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:54,634
created,

711
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,350
it behooves them to enhance that business
and spread that business and make that

712
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:03,270
business larger. Whether that business
is Chick-Filet or their businesses,

713
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,070
the TSA, once it's an actual business,
so it's not a government agency. Oh,

714
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,000
it's a business.
It's a private business.

715
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,210
That's where things are always going
to get weird because as soon as you can

716
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:17,100
profit and like it's not just
the state profits. No, no,

717
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,470
no individuals profit
and they have motivation.

718
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,890
And then they also can have things
called lobbyists and they could spend a

719
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:27,580
shitload of money to try to get laws
pushed by that make their business more

720
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:32,320
profitable and make more what? That's
crazy. That's where it gets crazy.

721
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,410
You can't differentiate anymore
between the corporatist and the actual

722
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:38,040
government employees. So
it's hard to tell. It's like,

723
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,630
it sounds like you're calling for
socialism now. You fucks without me.

724
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,570
That's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing a
bunch of fucking anticapitalist nonsense.

725
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,450
Why? If it wasn't for
capitalism, which is so true.

726
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:51,740
If it wasn't for capitals and
we wouldn't have shit, you know,

727
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,140
communism doesn't work.

728
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,440
You can't get people to work
unless you give them a reward.

729
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:58,780
If you want cool shit,
you want a Samsung phone,

730
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,440
you want to be able to watch TV on
a big screen, it's flat. You get it.

731
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:04,990
Someone's going to make that,
okay, you're not going to do it,

732
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,510
and the capitalism is the
only way that shit gets done.

733
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,640
If the whole world is
communists and socialists,

734
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,870
that stuff doesn't probably get made. Why
are, those are only two options though.

735
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,490
My question because I think there's
a lot of flaws and capitalism.

736
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,150
You're so right.
You know what we need,

737
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:24,010
I think is some sort of moralism.
Capitalism in a,

738
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,700
not just not capitalism, not
communism, but moralism, ethical ism,

739
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,610
and it's something where it's just
like, John, can we figure this out?

740
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,040
It seems like this cannot be worked out.
Like we don't have to like live

741
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,630
like one person has to die,

742
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,080
so that all may live like it's
2000 and fucking 13 or any people

743
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,430
kills me.
Like I get this,

744
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,180
I see the potential that we have and
we're just fucking squandering it. Yeah.

745
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:46,820
It's like what the fuck?
We know that we can have clean energy,

746
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:47,690
we know that we can have this,

747
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:50,720
we know that we can live compatibly
and harmoniously like with the earth,

748
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:53,660
but we're just fucking raping,
pillaging shit. I mean I think,

749
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:57,440
I think it's a flaw in
capitalism to see what happens.

750
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,130
Monopolies form and then it
buys out governments. And

751
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,580
you said a flaw though,

752
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:06,830
or is it almost like a built in
mechanism designed to encourage movement?

753
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,940
It's all, it's almost like the, the
way that things really get done,

754
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:14,030
but you need some incredibly
greedy fucks if this is the trend

755
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,610
that's designed within capitalism
than isn't that fucked?

756
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,330
Yes, it's definitely
fucked. But the question is,

757
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,600
is it this way because this is the
most efficient way to move this thing

758
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:25,390
forward.

759
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,620
This is the most efficient way to
continue to produce new technological

760
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:34,210
innovations, to continue to push
our ability to access information,

761
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:38,260
whether it's like willingly given up
through the internet or whether they're

762
00:42:38,261 --> 00:42:41,410
watching your cell phones like that.
All of it is kind of connected.

763
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,470
Well, it's interesting because we hear
a lot, you know, um, you need reward,

764
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:46,430
you need value,

765
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:49,940
you need people competing
and that otherwise you won't
have innovation and you

766
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:52,660
won't have these new technologies.
But I look at it, you know,

767
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,550
we had innovations 20 years
ago that cars can run on water,

768
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:59,120
but the car industry bought out
and pat this patent and this,

769
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,020
you see this across the board.
So we actually see an, uh,

770
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,230
technology is being stifled because of
the capitalist model that we live in,

771
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:09,440
this vulture capitalism where they're
monopolizing all these industries and

772
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:11,200
preventing technology from a rising.

773
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,150
So that water car thing is
totally true. No. Yeah. Yeah.

774
00:43:15,151 --> 00:43:18,460
I had heard in the electric car, remember
who killed the electric car. Yes,

775
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,670
I heard about the water thing
on Opie and Anthony. Uh,

776
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:25,230
they were talking about how the guy who
created it died of a heart attack and he

777
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:28,380
was, he had a meeting with two men
and he ran the restaurant screaming.

778
00:43:28,381 --> 00:43:31,180
They poisoned me and then
die of a heart attack. Yes.

779
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,700
Yeah. See if you guys can see
if you can find that story.

780
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,880
Cause a stoping Anthony
were talking about it.

781
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:42,480
It sounded like a fucking scene in a
movie. Like the guy he like yelled,

782
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:46,020
they poisoned me and ran out and
had a heart attack or a stroke.

783
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,040
I can't remember my memory's
shit. Uh, but it's um,

784
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,410
my memory is actually
excellent for our human,

785
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,590
but there's just too much to
remember. Yeah, that's true.

786
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,560
I don't know.
We can reinvent the wheel here.

787
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:03,561
I think that we can advance humanity in
our collective consciousness to a point

788
00:44:03,871 --> 00:44:07,950
where we can like figure out a different
way instead of reverting back to these

789
00:44:07,951 --> 00:44:11,760
old paradigms of like
communism or capitalism and
the way that we know, I mean,

790
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:15,210
can't we recreate something?
We, we know what exists.

791
00:44:15,211 --> 00:44:18,360
We have the ability to intercommunicate
within the entire planet.

792
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,000
The technology's growing exponentially.

793
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:23,880
I just think that we can do
better than what we've seen.

794
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,980
I think you're totally right.
I think we need to learn as human beings,

795
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:32,010
we need to learn how to manage
our humanity and there's

796
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,740
a lot of things that we're going to
have to take into consideration when you

797
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:36,360
start talking about that kind of stuff.

798
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,860
And one of them is that people have a
desire for competition. They just do.

799
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:45,861
They always have and that has
to be quelled in some form.

800
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,950
Whether you should take up a game that
you enjoy or get involved in sports or in

801
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,483
court.

802
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,510
Martial arts are a good example or some
form of discipline that allows you to

803
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:02,511
like blow off energy and blow off this
competitive design that you have inside

804
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:06,060
of you that sort of as allowed human
beings to get to this point in the first

805
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:10,890
place. I mean we didn't survive for tens
of thousands of years because we weren't

806
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:15,600
intent on survival at all costs. And one
of that, one of the costs is competition.

807
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,680
It's a part of what what's made us a human
being. It's a part of why we're here.

808
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,780
And I think that when people
get involved in anything,

809
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,250
whether it's a corporate
thing or whether it's uh, uh,

810
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,860
competition and uh,
a game or a team,

811
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,950
there's this desire to do better
than those you're competing against.

812
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:38,610
Like if you talk to people
that are business people
and they'll talk about their

813
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,400
competitors were fucking kicking it
right down their throat, they're,

814
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:43,020
they're like very aggressive about shit.

815
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,020
When you get guys alone they start talking
about how well they're doing against

816
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:47,100
the competition.
Yeah.

817
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:49,620
They closed down through their stores
and like they start getting like real

818
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:54,180
excited about conquering shit and it's,
it's, it's that mimicked that this,

819
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:57,330
this genetic thing. I think that's
like almost been incorporated into our,

820
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,680
our DNA because it's been so responsible
for getting people to this point.

821
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,790
Like you have to crack eggs
in order to make an Omelet.

822
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
There had to be a bunch of crazy shit to
get us to rise from apes with sticks to

823
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,390
driving a car and to do it all so fast it,

824
00:46:15,391 --> 00:46:18,720
there had to be a lot of
chaos involved in doing that.

825
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,300
But we should be able
to recognize that now

826
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,980
and go, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa,

827
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,010
okay, everybody catch your breath. It
took us a long fucking time to get here,

828
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,820
but let's look at why we got here. This
is what, this was what motivated us.

829
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,440
You see all this.
We just wanted to breed,

830
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,410
want to make sure we have children and
make sure that we stopped the barbarian

831
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:39,270
hordes from coming over
from the next town over.

832
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,650
If we can just all agreed to not be
fuckheads. None of that's going to happen.

833
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:45,210
We can all talk now.
Okay.

834
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:48,960
This isn't like you speak German and I
don't understand Dutch and he's Chinese.

835
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,060
No, no, no, no, no, no. Everybody
pretty knows what the fuck.

836
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,740
Pretty much knows what the
fuck everybody else is saying,

837
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:56,550
so everybody just chill. That's all
she can. We agree to chill. Okay,

838
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:59,730
let's choose your own thing. Let's
figure out this fucking resource thing.

839
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,000
There's a natural resource thing that
it seems like as all of ours. Okay.

840
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,230
Why don't other people get to keep that
and how come the people that get to keep

841
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:10,950
that keep wanting to go to war
and controls you? Let's, you know,

842
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:12,150
I know it sounds a little radical,

843
00:47:12,151 --> 00:47:15,180
but maybe you guys are kind of being
consumed by controlling all the oil,

844
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:19,820
isn't it? The Earth's yeah. You suck in
and out of holes in the ground. Like what?

845
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,200
It's fucking fascinating that we're just
wasting all of this magical resource

846
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:27,680
that's takes billions of years to compound
in the earth that were just blowing

847
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:30,460
it. Fucking killed. It
makes for awesome cars

848
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,270
does, but we don't save it. Yeah.

849
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:36,180
It's a stupid thing I've
said before that I think

850
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,160
they're going to do is eventually
come up with some sort of a,

851
00:47:38,161 --> 00:47:42,490
a bacteria that eats carbon dioxide in
the air and they're going to release it

852
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,850
like a moth,
like a colony of Moss in the air.

853
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,440
It's going to chew through all the
pollution, but then it's gonna meet tails.

854
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,420
Yeah, but that's going to mutate
to bring up cam. Charles, please,

855
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,250
please don't bring up chem trails.
Kim Cherrelle believers. I love Ya.

856
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,300
I feel Ya. I used to, I probably
could have been one of you. Okay.

857
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:04,390
But I read a couple of articles
along the way. Just don't,

858
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:08,920
I'm not a fucking Geo engineer and I'm
not a new world order person either.

859
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,050
Right.
The illuminati stop.

860
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,760
Well I just haven't met one.
I haven't seen one pilot who's,

861
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,890
I mean if they were spraying chemicals
on us and the government was doing this

862
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,420
around the world every day,

863
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,080
don't you think that some pilot would
have come out and said like, I don't know,

864
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,830
Yo, you know, who knows, why would
he sprays on family, you know,

865
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:29,470
and like it's very nonspecific
way to poison the world

866
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,550
already getting enough poison. I
don't, but it has been done. Did the,

867
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,393
the thing about

868
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,510
yeah.

869
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,140
Dropping stuff from plains has been done
and in fact there was a recent article

870
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:42,860
that was uh,
it was just published about a,

871
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,490
these tests that they did I want to say,
oh shoot, I should look it up. But um,

872
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,530
it was uh, there were spraying
radioactive waste from, from playing.

873
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,660
Yeah,
the monitor crazy shit.

874
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,090
Engineering experiments and
then the cloud seeding and said,

875
00:48:57,091 --> 00:49:01,290
there is like geoengineering
happening and it works, but it's not

876
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,060
to the extent of what people look,
it's always they like,

877
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,590
I know I was just about to say, yeah,
they gave the the Tuskegee experiment,

878
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,980
they gave those guys syphilis or allowed
them to have syphilis and not treat

879
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:18,780
them. This is all like that. They thing
is a real problem because it's not,

880
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:21,600
they're not all part of the same group.
It's people that are cunts.

881
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,351
That's what it is,

882
00:49:22,351 --> 00:49:26,070
is assholes that have done something
wrong and w w if they're in a position of

883
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:27,820
government, it's always
they, it's like they have

884
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,330
done that. Yeah. If someone just asked
me last night, they said, do you know,

885
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,390
do you believe in the new world order
or the Illuminati and stuff? And I said,

886
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,290
well,

887
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:37,530
I think that it's giving them too much
credit and it's also taking away people's

888
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:38,460
agency to be like,

889
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:41,990
there's this unknowable group controlling
everything behind the shadows.

890
00:49:41,991 --> 00:49:43,980
It's like, no, we know that these
mother fuckers are, you can, they're,

891
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,030
they're hidden in plain sight.

892
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:48,600
It's the board of directors of all the
most powerful corporations in the world.

893
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:50,040
I mean,
these are the people who are,

894
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:55,580
yeah. Hunting Shit. This is a fact.
Okay. Then in the 1950s and this is, uh,

895
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,840
this is often Yahoo news.
This is,

896
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,620
this is widely reported throughout
the Internet, which means everything,

897
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,603
the Internet,

898
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,600
I don't know what's true. I don't
know. It's true. I'm not a researcher.

899
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:09,780
Yeah, yeah. We've got one there. Oh,
wow. Bam. We're like, Fuck Jeanie's here.

900
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:13,620
James does genie's this woman says that,
um,

901
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,060
she lost her baby when her father died.
Uh,

902
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,320
she was a baby rather when her father
died and explicit inexplicably in 1955 and

903
00:50:21,481 --> 00:50:25,680
she watched four siblings die of cancer
and she survived cervical cancer.

904
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:26,260
Upon learning,

905
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,260
the army conducted chemical tests in her
impoverish St Louis and neighborhood in

906
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,750
the height of the Cold War.

907
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,650
She wonders if her own governments
to Blaine in the mid 1950s and again,

908
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:40,970
a decade later,
the army used mode motorized blowers,

909
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:45,971
a top low income housing and high rise
at schools and from the backs of station

910
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:51,791
wagons to send a potentially dangerous
compound into the already hazy air in

911
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:57,170
predominantly black areas of St Louis.
Local officials will trope.

912
00:50:57,171 --> 00:51:01,100
We're told at the time that the government
was testing a smokescreen that could

913
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:05,590
shield Saint Louis from aerial observation
in case the Russians attack. Wow.

914
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,320
But in 1994 the government said that
the tests were a part of a biological

915
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:13,910
weapons program and Saint Louis was
chosen because it bore some resemblance to

916
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:17,350
Russian cities at the u s might attack.
Holy Shit.

917
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:21,260
The materials being sprayed with zinc,
cadmium sulfide,

918
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:25,190
a fine fluorescent powder.
Oh my God,

919
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,700
that's horrible.
That's so scary.

920
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,310
There's just no accountability for any
of this shit that's, that's happened.

921
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:34,760
I'm sure these people got like a very
little payout that they've just watched

922
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:39,150
all their family die. It's so scary.
It's terrible. And then here's the,

923
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:43,550
here's the thing for the [inaudible]
folks, this is real. This is real.

924
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:48,610
And when you're looking at a lot of things
that may or may not be what you think

925
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:54,050
they are, it's really important
to find out what is real. Right?

926
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,100
It's really important.

927
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:59,660
And if you're not sure if something is
just a jet engine creating an artificial

928
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:02,900
cloud because it's passing through
condensation or if it's the government

929
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:05,660
spraying you,
if you call one or the other,

930
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,360
it becomes a problem for
all of the information.

931
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,730
Absolutely dilutes the real argument,

932
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:15,710
which is the fact that
there's the challenge or even
just the jet fuel of just

933
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,790
planes in general.

934
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,270
The jet fuel thing is crazy and that's
something that we figured out on the

935
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:25,130
shows that 93,000 flights
a day fly worldwide,

936
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,010
93,000 saying it's incredible.

937
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:32,780
And there was a study done after
nine 11 which is really fascinating.

938
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,850
And this is kind of funny
because it was in CNN,

939
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:37,310
this is long before the chem trail thing,
either a,

940
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:40,210
it's a CNN article from 2002 uh,

941
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,170
and it was talking about
how the temperature shifted
because of the fact that

942
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:49,250
there was no contrails in the sky and
that these contractors and it referred to

943
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:51,740
them as the artificial
clouds created by jet planes,

944
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,070
that these contrail had
been cooling the earth.

945
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,170
The difference was a couple of degrees.

946
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,750
I don't know how the fuck they can
tell whether or not they're a couple of

947
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:00,110
degrees.

948
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:04,070
Variance is just natural cause things
vary all the time as far as temperature.

949
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,640
But in this article they were trying to
attribute it to the fact that there was

950
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:10,460
no controls in the sky, which
is fascinating. That's crazy.

951
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:14,420
I think to me there's no causal
connection to the heavy metals,

952
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,690
corrosive metals found in the,
in the water than it is the spraying.

953
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:20,810
I mean we have no connection at all and
that's like the only evidence people can

954
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:21,860
keep showing me is they're just like,

955
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:25,710
look at you Berrien and aluminum is found
in this and the water. And I'm like,

956
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:26,070
dude,
we're

957
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,650
fucking polluting the whole earth. I mean
water's cyclical. Like I don't, yeah,

958
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,820
it's,
well it's weird.

959
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,900
It's w what we worry about is
weird because the chem trails,

960
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,090
if the government really
was spraying something,

961
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,920
that is something we should worry
about, but stop. What are the effects?

962
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,220
I don't feel anything. If they are
really doing this on a regular basis.

963
00:53:48,221 --> 00:53:49,380
If they just cooling the water,

964
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,830
what is exactly going on now let's stop
and look at the shit that we're not

965
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:55,950
paying attention to. We're pumping
like raw sewage into the ocean.

966
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,820
Like people going like just
shitting into the ocean. There's,

967
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:03,600
there's like boats that
are burning diesel fuel.

968
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,980
This other Schultz with giant nets that
are killing every fucking fish within

969
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:09,710
it's, you know, whatever stretched.

970
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:14,250
They've got these goddamn killer net
set up for just salted fish out of it,

971
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,140
throwing plastic in there.
There's a gigantic garbage chat.

972
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,220
There's one in the Great Lakes do.
There's one in every Monday at fucking

973
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,850
talking to this woman talking about
plastic. And she was saying 20 years ago,

974
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:30,210
this research team went out fucking
hundreds of miles away from the great

975
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:33,630
Pacific garbage patch and the fish
that they were fishing full of plastic

976
00:54:33,631 --> 00:54:36,390
particles and all of a sudden this guy
went down to the bottom of the ocean

977
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,650
where they were and it was covered in
plastic bags. And this was 20 years ago.

978
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,910
Can you imagine how it is now?
I mean this,

979
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,950
this is the shit that we should be
considering. Exactly. It's, it's,

980
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:50,790
so this Saint Louis Story for the
chem trail folks, here's one in your,

981
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,910
in your corner. This is
real. Okay. This is real.

982
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,710
So you are right to distrust any people
that could be in a position of power

983
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:01,470
that could possibly profit from doing
something that could harm people.

984
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,020
You're absolutely right to be
paranoid about that. Um, that's,

985
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:08,940
that's not what I say when, when, you
know, when I talk about these things,

986
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:12,330
I just think it's really important to
be aware of exactly what's happening.

987
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,310
It's the same thing with fluoride.

988
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,500
I think Florida is horrible and
it shouldn't be in drinking water.

989
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:17,131
But the thing is,

990
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:20,880
it's been kind of hijacked into this
conspiracy theory that says like it's this

991
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:25,530
mass mind control thing and trying to
give everyone brain damage and Hitler used

992
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,020
it on, on the Jews. It's that,
first of all that's not true.

993
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:30,060
There's no evidence to back
that up. But also it's like, no,

994
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:34,470
it's just a phosphate mineral byproducts
that were just pouring in the water

995
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:36,450
supplies. Like that's what
we should be concerned about.

996
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:39,810
That there's a waste product being
sold to municipalities and just fucking

997
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:40,950
toxifying our water.

998
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:44,980
But isn't the idea that people
who use fluoride fluoride,

999
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,590
what does it fluoridated? Florida doesn't
sound right. Fluoridated sounds wrong.

1000
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:53,280
Um, fluoridated water have better
teeth like that is actual health.

1001
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,020
The Ada did an extensive study,
uh,

1002
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:59,430
about a decade ago that showed that it
was just better hygiene overall that just

1003
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:01,590
showed that people just had better
hygiene overall. And it really,

1004
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:05,670
there's no difference between fluoridated
and non fluoridated areas. Whoa. Really,

1005
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:10,380
really just topically applying
fluoride. Yes, that is, you know,

1006
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,350
that helps with tooth
decay but ingesting it,

1007
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:15,540
we're already getting it when we shower,
when we cook,

1008
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:20,000
like why are we drinking it too?
It just doesn't back at the history,

1009
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,040
the idea was that the,
the water having fluoride in it would

1010
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,030
help with tooth decay as well
as does it do anything else?

1011
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,970
No kill anything offering.
It's not even Florida, it's a,

1012
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:35,200
it's a this thing called a hexa florists
allistic acid and it's just a fucking

1013
00:56:35,201 --> 00:56:38,440
fertilizer byproduct
that they've just like,

1014
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:42,880
it's just this old school collusion
between the fertilizer industry and the

1015
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:45,460
water industry is just based on
like a huge propaganda campaign.

1016
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:47,680
It's saying that fluoride is good for
your teeth and we just kind of still

1017
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:50,260
believe it. It's bizarre. There's so
many other countries in the world.

1018
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:52,470
I do not do that at all.
Wow.

1019
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,100
Well if you ever had like real springwater
like right from a, like a Colorado,

1020
00:56:57,101 --> 00:57:00,520
well I just had distilled water for the
first time. It tastes like fucking snow.

1021
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,710
You've got to be careful.
What is the deal?

1022
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,240
It doesn't have any minerals
in it cause it leaches them.

1023
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,300
Yeah,
there's a process

1024
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,260
process. I don't know. I shouldn't
say it takes out all the minerals,

1025
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:13,310
but I think it takes up most of them.

1026
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:18,160
Magnetize what my friend Aubrey actually
had a problem because he was drinking

1027
00:57:18,161 --> 00:57:20,000
it on a regular basis. Uh, you know,

1028
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:25,001
he wasn't aware of the consequences of
not having enough minerals and he started

1029
00:57:25,101 --> 00:57:28,220
getting like his heart was beating
too fast. He was kind of freaking out.

1030
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:31,970
Like he had an electrolyte imbalance
and it was because he was drinking

1031
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:34,970
distilled water all the time.
Like you have to have like,

1032
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,230
people think that like salt is bad
for you. It's salt is essential. Look,

1033
00:57:39,231 --> 00:57:42,510
if you eat a pound of it, you're
dead. Okay. But salt is in it.

1034
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,060
It's a huge part of what it is
to be a human being. You need it.

1035
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:50,570
That's why they used to go to war for
that shit. They used to have salt wars.

1036
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,880
Like when people kill
people for all their salts.

1037
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,890
My friend swears in distilled water.
He,

1038
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:59,360
he drinks it every day and he
should be careful. Well was great.

1039
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:03,410
The idea is if you take it with
like some milk Himalayan salt, uh,

1040
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,660
something that has a lot of
minerals in it or to some,

1041
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,960
if as long as he supplements with
minerals, maybe he'll be okay.

1042
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,580
But Aubrey, I mean he went to a
doctor and the doctor told them like,

1043
00:58:13,581 --> 00:58:15,360
you have an imbalance here,
so what are you doing?

1044
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,340
Why are you drinking that water and irons
humidifier.

1045
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,450
Humidifier fire is a funny word.
Yeah, that's a, you gotta be careful.

1046
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:28,120
But yeah, the floor, I think it just,

1047
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,620
it's just one of those things that no
one will even address. They're like, oh,

1048
00:58:30,621 --> 00:58:33,050
what do you think fluoride is
bad too? You're like, well no,

1049
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,220
you just should really,
you're right. Even it's good.

1050
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,220
Don't want to be mass medicated against.
And I will like,

1051
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:40,640
why do we need this in our
water? Right. And it's also,

1052
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:43,580
I'm sure it probably does some
weird shit to your skin too.

1053
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:45,990
Hot Water with fluoride in it.

1054
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,810
You get an excess of Florida gives
you fluorosis which eats away.

1055
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,740
They namel over your teeth. So you
see the yellow fucking like, yeah.

1056
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,360
Cause it's the opposite.
Yeah, it actually,

1057
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:56,840
and it's so thing about what that's doing
to your bones if you get an excess of

1058
00:58:56,841 --> 00:59:01,520
fluoride. Oh Wow. I never thought of
that. So, okay. Is this hippie bullshit?

1059
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:02,383
Nah Dude,

1060
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,550
that's really funny though.
The way you said that. No Dude.

1061
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,820
That's exactly what someone who's
telling hippie bullshit. Nah Bro.

1062
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,920
Come on. Cause Jerry Yo dude, I read
that shit. I'm going back website.

1063
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:20,970
I swear I saw on the Internet
is legit fuck's on that floor.

1064
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,310
I dated in a water.

1065
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,160
That'd be Martin and talk bad
knowledge about that on our tea.

1066
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:30,590
Lots of research dogs, government. Is it,

1067
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:34,580
is it one of those things where like
someone just started getting paid for

1068
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:38,150
bringing fluoride and then the
fluoride is just a part of life now?

1069
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,130
Yeah. The aluminum industry needed to get
rid of their byproducts. They were on,

1070
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,470
they launched this propaganda campaign.

1071
00:59:44,471 --> 00:59:47,540
There's like in the fifties and it was
just this old school thing that was,

1072
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,860
we didn't really understand that we can
just have better hygiene by brushing our

1073
00:59:50,861 --> 00:59:53,050
teeth now was like, yeah,
people did have fucked up teeth.

1074
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:57,670
How do they purify water? Like when,
like if, if the use, what do they use?

1075
00:59:57,671 --> 01:00:00,560
They use chlorine or something like
that. What chemicals? These surefire,

1076
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:03,790
it's from the phosphate mining. So
they, they take it and they just like,

1077
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:08,510
they capture the water that's escaping
in these giant scrubbers and then they

1078
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:11,080
just sell it. Like, I don't fucking
know what they did. A purified,

1079
01:00:11,081 --> 01:00:13,330
I hope to God that they're
doing something to purify it.

1080
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:18,130
No, I mean what, I'm sorry. I should
rephrase. What I meant was when,

1081
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,440
if you like,
say if you get water out of the Faucet,

1082
01:00:20,441 --> 01:00:22,210
when you go to this foster right
now and get a glass of water,

1083
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,550
they're doing something in that
water. Right. What do they do?

1084
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:29,470
Cause a purification. Chlorine
fluorine. Uh, well we should ask,

1085
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,310
right?
We should like Google this real dark.

1086
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:34,520
As crazy as I just had this interesting,
uh,

1087
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,670
thing with Nestle where they
send us this lawsuit threat.

1088
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:42,810
Like they're basically threatening
to sue us because I criticized their

1089
01:00:42,811 --> 01:00:45,640
monopolization over the water supply
and how they're trying to prioritize

1090
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,700
water. Yeah, I've read that.

1091
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:52,270
I didn't even want to like actually read
the quote because somebody sent it to

1092
01:00:52,271 --> 01:00:54,010
me in Twitter and I looked at it.
I was like,

1093
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,210
I don't even want to read that because
it's like someone going to be bummed out

1094
01:00:58,211 --> 01:00:59,100
by those duties.

1095
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:02,990
There's the, see the ex CEO Peter
Brabeck. He's still like a, I don't know,

1096
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:05,710
he's still highly influential
at the company, but he came
out and said, you know,

1097
01:01:05,711 --> 01:01:08,860
it's a food stuff, like any other,
it should be applied to market price.

1098
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:11,590
We should not like basically just
privatized all the water in the world.

1099
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,200
And he was like, if he's like, if
you think water's a human right,

1100
01:01:14,201 --> 01:01:15,490
you're an extremist.
I was like,

1101
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,710
that's fucking great.
And every single day,

1102
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:22,760
yeah, this is probably Nestle. No, this
isn't necessarily, but it seriously,

1103
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:27,680
every single bottled water I've seen
as Nestle and a, it's terrifying.

1104
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:28,980
It's terrifying what they're doing right

1105
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,410
during these routes. Yeah,
correct. That's ridiculous.

1106
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:36,250
What a crazy way of looking at
the world. So yeah, that's like,

1107
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,320
so he wants to treat water oil,
essentially. He wants to fucking,

1108
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:42,470
what's the next air? Monopolize
it. What we're trying to do.

1109
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:47,420
That wasn't someone trying to
actually sell cans of air because wow,

1110
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,860
they do it in a hotel in Seattle.
Well that's actually a oxygen. Yeah.

1111
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:53,240
It's like a pick me up.

1112
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:56,030
Like people think that like
you ever go to the oxygen bar.

1113
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,010
They have like those picked me up bars.
He used to have those. I went to one once,

1114
01:02:00,011 --> 01:02:02,450
didn't do Jack Shit.
I sat there on Tuesday.

1115
01:02:02,451 --> 01:02:04,760
Windows feels like I just paid 20 bucks.
It just

1116
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,070
gives you heightened awareness.
I think just that they came a carrot.

1117
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,170
I think just thinking that you're doing
something that gives you a heightened

1118
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:18,600
awareness heightens your awareness cause
you're like cognizant of it. Like yeah,

1119
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,670
I'm going to really,
really focus.

1120
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,070
You talk about so much as the placebo
effect because this is something that's

1121
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:24,240
fucking nuts.

1122
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,270
The fact that we can heal things with
their body and people just dismiss it.

1123
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:28,920
They're like, oh, that's just
the placebo effect. You're like,

1124
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:32,670
that's so fucking crazy. That's way
crazier than like having medicine that

1125
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:39,570
cultivating this so much. But also
it really begs the question, what is,

1126
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,180
what is the state of our body based on?

1127
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:46,040
Is it based on confidence and
feeling and thoughts and the the,

1128
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:50,610
the kind of like ideas that you called
debate or is it actually based on

1129
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:51,990
genetics and disease?

1130
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:55,590
Like how much is which way when all
of a sudden someone can cure something

1131
01:02:55,591 --> 01:02:56,401
because they think that the,

1132
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:58,950
I don't know how many instances
where that actually takes place.

1133
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:03,030
The placebo effect might be Greg
greatly exaggerated. I don't know.

1134
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:05,520
I don't know how much has
actually been done placebo style,

1135
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:10,160
but I know that it's big enough that
it's occurred enough times where it's,

1136
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:14,970
it's documentable. Like people can like
refer to it as an actual situation.

1137
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:18,480
There's a placebo effect that actually
does happen. So what's going on there?

1138
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:19,711
I don't know.

1139
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:24,390
I think that it needs to be cultivated
way more studied way more like I,

1140
01:03:24,391 --> 01:03:27,900
it's just funny that it's kind of this
weird thing in science. You're like, oh,

1141
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,170
it's just the placebo. It's like, have
you thought about what that means though?

1142
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,900
Because that's fucking nuts.
It's also,

1143
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:39,150
it makes you wonder what exactly
is really shaping this world.

1144
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,160
Like how much of what's shaping this
world is thoughts and how much of it is

1145
01:03:44,161 --> 01:03:47,850
circumstance and how much of
it is just random occurrences.

1146
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:51,810
How much are you steering this thing
with your thoughts when you find out that

1147
01:03:51,811 --> 01:03:55,830
you can fix something that you didn't
think you could fix because someone told

1148
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:59,670
you they gave you a pill that fixes it
and then all of a sudden you fix it. Well,

1149
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:03,120
think about what stress does to
you. Can you totally. It's crazy.

1150
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:06,840
It's bill that for you. Yeah. And also
it makes you make shitty decisions.

1151
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:10,700
You do do rash things. You,
you yell at people that you
shouldn't, you're like, ah,

1152
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:15,330
it builds up. Yeah, it's
terrible. It's terrible. Terrible.

1153
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:16,380
It's awful.

1154
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:20,070
But it's the way I saw this documentary
about water and there was like this

1155
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:21,700
Japanese scientist who,
you know,

1156
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,810
put different feelings in different
bottles of water, a glass of water,

1157
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:29,580
and then I don't, I mean it's
been debunked. Yeah. Apparently.

1158
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,490
I don't know. We'd have to
get a debunker arm. Right.

1159
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,490
But then the debunker would get all sorts
of hate mail and it would never come,

1160
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:38,250
want to come back again. That's what
happens when you debunk things, man.

1161
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:42,060
She does nick, Mick West, the guy who was
the debunker on our show, he runs metal,

1162
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:45,660
bunk.com so he debunked everything.
Anything that's,

1163
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:49,620
he finds out what's bullshit about
something and debunks it and he's,

1164
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:53,760
he's right a staggering amount of times.
And this guy's just,

1165
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:58,040
his timeline is just, hey, hey,

1166
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:01,590
on Twitter, people hate when
you debunk their, should

1167
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:08,700
they so invested and JFK
so invested in everything,

1168
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,000
whether it's Lee Harvey
Oswald acted alone,

1169
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:15,930
or whether it's fucking conspiracy
from the Grassy Knoll, whatever it is,

1170
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,160
anti conspiracy,

1171
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,980
or does it really take it
like where you're like,

1172
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,800
I will look at everything and really kind
of sort through it? Or is he just like,

1173
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:25,420
I'm gonna debunk kind of the main points?

1174
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:26,860
Yeah,
he's a debunker.

1175
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:30,760
He likes calling people and
conspiracy to Zitter bullshit.

1176
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,960
Even if he's wrong. I mean, I don't
know if that's right all the time,

1177
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:39,040
but it's pretty obvious. His trend is
to debunk things. But along the way,

1178
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:40,100
I got to say,
I've,

1179
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,150
one of the things that I've learned
about this television show is the

1180
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:47,630
psychological effect of wanting
to believe in something. And the,

1181
01:05:47,631 --> 01:05:52,600
the similar attributes that I find in
almost everyone who believes in something

1182
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:54,910
that can't be proven. There's very, very,

1183
01:05:54,911 --> 01:05:57,220
very similar attributes
as a very similar mindset.

1184
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:02,240
But yeah, I agree. Um, but when I look
at something like, you know, nine 11,

1185
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,070
I know what isn't logical and it's what
they've told us this happened. Yeah.

1186
01:06:07,071 --> 01:06:11,310
So it's like, I don't know what happened,
but I know what didn't happen. So

1187
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:12,801
that's another,

1188
01:06:12,801 --> 01:06:16,310
that's one that always comes up whenever
someone believes in something that's

1189
01:06:16,311 --> 01:06:20,750
odd. There's always the, what about
tower seven discussion, you know? Yeah.

1190
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:24,770
There you go. That's the discussion.
That's the skin people in 2013.

1191
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:28,250
They're almost like Jesus Christ is 12
years of fucking tower seven can't do it

1192
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:31,700
anymore, buddy. I can't. Okay. I
gotta tap out no more tower seven doc.

1193
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,050
We can't fix that thing. It's gone.
It's gone. Let's concentrate on bigfoot.

1194
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:41,540
No, it's um, yeah, there's a, um,

1195
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:45,020
there's a reality to the world,
right? There's a reality.

1196
01:06:45,021 --> 01:06:49,730
And then there's a trying to decipher
reality from looking at the past,

1197
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,270
whether the passage is five minutes ago,
whether the past is two hours ago.

1198
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,330
When you're dealing with
something monumental like nine 11,

1199
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,340
you're going to have a lot of noise.
There's going to be so much information,

1200
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,400
good and real and bad and distorted and
crazy and sane and logical and cryptic.

1201
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,850
There's going to be a
lot of shit going on.

1202
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:16,120
So you look at any catastrophic situation
like towers falling and people dying

1203
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:18,530
and you're going to
have a lot of craziness,

1204
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:22,220
so you're going to have a lot of shit
that doesn't jive and you got to have a

1205
01:07:22,221 --> 01:07:24,980
lot of shit that also
leans towards a conspiracy.

1206
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,730
Then it's also the possibility conspiracy.

1207
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,550
And that's what people
don't like to think.

1208
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:34,280
They don't like to think
that it's not an either or.

1209
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:38,090
And that whom you don't know.
You don't think unless you were there.

1210
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:39,340
Can't be sure.

1211
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,870
Why is conspiracy about,
it's been a,

1212
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,500
it's been turned into a pejorative
where it just shuts down and you know,

1213
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:50,020
it's amazing. Really? Yeah, it is. That
was actually deliberate effort by the CIA.

1214
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,110
What's really it? Yeah.
They're so bad ass.

1215
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:58,660
I wish I could score the CIA because
they're so bad ass in so many ways that

1216
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:01,630
they could figure out how to fucking
engineer human consciousness so they could

1217
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:06,220
just make conspiracy thing sync.
Dopey. Oh, you got a conspiracy theory.

1218
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:10,480
You know what? Like the Gulf of Tonkin.
What? Like the Northwoods document.

1219
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:15,280
Just rattle off a bunch of
real shit. That's really
like, what about Enron? Right.

1220
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:16,200
That's a good spirits.

1221
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,830
They conspired. People got
together and happens all the time.

1222
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:22,190
It's part of what makes people fucking
group into little huts at the get

1223
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:23,600
together. They have a little
tribes. They go, well,

1224
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:26,840
this one was one was just
one of the fucker's got gold.
They're right over there.

1225
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:30,130
They sleep at night. Let's go get
them. They happen all the time. Yeah.

1226
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,200
I love the CIA. Just for the
record, for the record, I don't,

1227
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,730
I like them individually as human beings.
I hope they're nice,

1228
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,370
but as a group, I'm not willing
to trust them unless I meet him.

1229
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:42,060
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah.

1230
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,430
I remember when they were also at
the center MK Ultra Shit. Yeah.

1231
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,260
So let me ask you this,

1232
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:50,990
and this is the fucking elephant in the
room when it comes to a journalism cause

1233
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:55,340
you're, you, you're a journalist, you're
looking official journalist, right? Legit.

1234
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:59,590
And you are also not afraid to
talk your mind, whatever it is.

1235
01:08:59,591 --> 01:09:02,420
You speak your mind about
various controversial subjects.

1236
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,690
And then you see this Michael
Hastings thing. Do you go, oh boy,

1237
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,320
I don't know the story.
Tell me the story.

1238
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,030
Okay. So Michael Hastings,
uh, amazing journalist,

1239
01:09:14,031 --> 01:09:17,360
one of the last real investigative
journalists that we have that, I mean,

1240
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,880
he'd go on the court from media
and just fucking destroyed.

1241
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:24,530
Like he just completely make everyone look
like idiots. But he's very aggressive,

1242
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:26,360
very aggressive.
But he was just like,

1243
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,660
you could tell he's just exasperated
with the mentality that he was surrounded

1244
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:32,030
by it. Whenever we be like all
these Obama apologists and stuff,

1245
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:36,560
when he would go and argue and he was
embedded in Afghanistan for a while and

1246
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:40,130
actually did a report in the rolling
stone about Stanley McChrystal,

1247
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:41,720
which was the commanding general general,

1248
01:09:41,721 --> 01:09:46,490
the Afghanistan war that totally exposed
as us, um, ended up getting him fired.

1249
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:51,500
And when you get a general who's
commanding a war fired, um,

1250
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:55,670
you need to look out and like, you need to
fucking watch your back. And so, I mean,

1251
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:58,190
he got death threats at the time,
months later,

1252
01:09:58,191 --> 01:10:02,030
his car driving like a hundred miles an
hour down a fucking residential street

1253
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:06,140
in La and it just explodes. Why the
fuck would you be driving that fast?

1254
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:07,670
Nothing about it makes sense.

1255
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:12,230
He had just written a letter to his
friends and family hours before he died

1256
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:15,350
saying, I have to go off the radar.
The FBI's investigating me. Watch out.

1257
01:10:15,351 --> 01:10:17,250
They're going to come talk to you.
Um,

1258
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,580
it doesn't mean that it was
the government who killed him.

1259
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:21,620
It doesn't mean that it's,
there's some giant conspiracy.

1260
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:26,630
My view is that you get a commanding,
general fired and he knows fucking people.

1261
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,310
He knows security contractors,

1262
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:32,540
private firms that can fucking take
you out if you embarrass someone.

1263
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:33,980
I mean this should happen.
This is a hit.

1264
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,360
I don't know what happened to that guy,
but it sure looks like it.

1265
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:41,180
I mean if you wanted to look at a movie
scene, it's like a perfect movie scene.

1266
01:10:41,181 --> 01:10:46,030
It is in a James Bond film of a political
assassination. Yep. And it really is,

1267
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:50,190
the door's locked. The steering wheel
start to turning towards the tree like ah,

1268
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,530
your cars because salary is going shut up,
bitch.

1269
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,780
Why would I explain that on the air?
I think all the old cars,

1270
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,180
everybody get an old really old
dodge darts can be hacked too.

1271
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:05,020
And that's what the, yeah, that's nuts.
Well that's what I read afterwards.

1272
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,440
We'll do some guy who worked for
Clinton and for Herbert Walker.

1273
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:12,850
Bush was describing how it's absolutely
possible. I don't know if it was him,

1274
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,100
was him, Richard Clark, which

1275
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,340
I thought was strange in itself that
this guy would come out and be like,

1276
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:20,430
it looks like a car hacking to me. You're
like, you're fucking government insider.

1277
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:22,200
It was just strange.
I didn't know why he,

1278
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:27,310
I think the people in the
old guard probably don't
exactly like how shit is just

1279
01:11:27,891 --> 01:11:32,340
so loosey Goosey with the murders these
days. You know, they're like, hey,

1280
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,270
we didn't use to fucking
kill report is like,

1281
01:11:35,271 --> 01:11:40,070
this guy's going to
security cameras everywhere.

1282
01:11:40,071 --> 01:11:43,670
Like Bernstein's still a lot. But
basically they, one of them died recently.

1283
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:45,110
I don't know a little bit of Bernstein,

1284
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:47,720
but I mean, if you're asking if I'm
afraid. No, absolutely not. I mean,

1285
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,490
if you can't live in,

1286
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,890
I'm scared and I know you like being
in the room with you for three hours.

1287
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:56,970
I can close. Oh, how scary is
that? It's fucking terrifying.

1288
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,930
I wrote something down today as
a joke, but it was about, um,

1289
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:06,120
this fucking meat that they're
creating now. Ah, Shit. No, no, no, no.

1290
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:10,650
That's, that's exciting. No, there
was a, uh, a meat that they're there.

1291
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:14,940
They've made synthetic meat and
uh, you know, and I was just,

1292
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,410
yes,
yes.

1293
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,360
And I was just figured
out how to clone county.

1294
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:23,340
They took some cow meat and
without actually, you know,

1295
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:26,070
increasing the amount of cows in the room,
they increased the meat.

1296
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,950
They just put it in some
sort of a test tube,

1297
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:31,440
costs hundreds of thousands of dollars,
but they made like a cheeseburger.

1298
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:36,030
Why did this, this weird meat, and
I wrote it, today's fake meats,

1299
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:37,170
tomorrow's fake person,

1300
01:12:37,171 --> 01:12:41,190
solar powered program by the state
reading minds and writing tickets for bad

1301
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,350
thoughts like this.
Really possible, right?

1302
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,030
Like one day we could easily be in a
world where we have robot people just

1303
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:51,630
wandered around enforcing
the rules of a corrupt elite,

1304
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,010
a bunch of old dudes with fucking
just wires coming out of their body,

1305
01:12:56,011 --> 01:12:59,910
like barely hanging on, just
evil, keeping them in in the game,

1306
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:02,130
waiting for life extension technology,

1307
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,320
just hanging in there
with robots running around

1308
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,920
like actual thought crime.
It's not even funny with the NSA,

1309
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:11,190
just surveillance of everyone.
Blanket data mining.

1310
01:13:11,191 --> 01:13:14,100
And then this retroactive prosecution,
the ability to retroactive.

1311
01:13:14,101 --> 01:13:17,460
They prosecute you. If you fucking say
something today, 10 years from now,

1312
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:19,770
they can dredge that up and be
like you said this 10 years ago,

1313
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:23,970
wrongfully accused you of something
and pull up all this evidence over the

1314
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:26,340
course of your digital life
and use it against you.

1315
01:13:26,341 --> 01:13:27,750
And that's another really scary aspect.

1316
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:30,960
It's not even just the chilling effect
that quells descent and makes people not

1317
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:34,170
want to speak out as much. It's
that too. And that's scary.

1318
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:38,900
Yeah, that's very scary. It's very,
it's all very scary. It's, it's we're,

1319
01:13:38,901 --> 01:13:39,221
we're,

1320
01:13:39,221 --> 01:13:43,960
we're in such strange times because if
someone feels like they have the right to

1321
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:48,320
just look at everything you're doing
all the time, like where are we,

1322
01:13:48,321 --> 01:13:51,220
what are we dealing?
Like we're not even America anymore.

1323
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:55,300
Sun America when everyone can
just have their email looked at.

1324
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:00,400
And did you read the shit that David
Seaman put on is a page today that about

1325
01:14:00,401 --> 01:14:03,190
how they're using it.
The DEA is using it now.

1326
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:05,680
They're using the information
to catch drug dealers.

1327
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:10,030
They using the information to catch
people selling weed. I mean, they're not,

1328
01:14:10,031 --> 01:14:12,970
it's not just a security concern thing.

1329
01:14:12,971 --> 01:14:15,780
This is information that's being
distributed to other people.

1330
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,810
They're bypassing normal like protocol
for catching criminals and just fucking,

1331
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:22,630
well, what's really
crazy. Yes, you're right.

1332
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:26,320
But what's really crazy is that
he said that this is what's good.

1333
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,460
It was really weird,

1334
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:32,170
is that the NSA is giving your phone
records to the DEA and they're telling the

1335
01:14:32,171 --> 01:14:37,171
DEA is talking about how to cover it up
and to conduct a fake investigation to

1336
01:14:38,081 --> 01:14:43,081
acquire that information to back engineer
your discovery and then going back and

1337
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:46,210
acquiring enough evidence,

1338
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,050
post knowledge of the crime to,
you know,

1339
01:14:50,051 --> 01:14:53,200
like that they're actually going to
create a fake investigation. Well,

1340
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:56,620
he'd so that they hide the fact that
they got this information from the NSA.

1341
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:00,220
Right? Right. Like, Oh man, that
seems like a lot of work. Well,

1342
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:03,170
it doesn't just seem like a lot of
work. It seems like you're lying, right?

1343
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:07,250
Like you should. Yeah, there should be
some laws in this world, but there you,

1344
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:11,080
there also should be some nobility to
the people that are enforcing those laws

1345
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:15,670
and one of them is you shouldn't be
allowed to lie ever. Okay. Lines not good.

1346
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:21,040
Stop doing that. So if you're not lying,
how much of this actually happens?

1347
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:23,740
Well, none, because people go, wait a
minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1348
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:27,070
The DEA gets the fucking records too,
right? Okay. Where do you draw the line?

1349
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:30,430
What if someone's giving a friend a
bottle of Xanax because their prescription

1350
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,510
Randall able to be hacked.

1351
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,710
So where the line really
isn't drawn anywhere.

1352
01:15:33,711 --> 01:15:37,130
When you have foreign
governments or entities that
could hack into this shit and

1353
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:39,110
then use it. I mean, who knows, right?

1354
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:44,320
It's just, it's going to be out there.
Everything's going to be out there.

1355
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:49,510
They're just slowly trying to stop it.
They're still lying. They're like, oh no,

1356
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:52,440
it's just the metadata.
It's just the metadata. And
you're like, no dude, because

1357
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:55,460
the the storage center in Utah or
whatever that you're storing this,

1358
01:15:55,461 --> 01:15:58,380
like the metadata would only account
for like a fucking eighth of that

1359
01:15:58,381 --> 01:16:00,630
information that's stored in there
and you already building other ones.

1360
01:16:00,631 --> 01:16:02,250
So what the hell else is the rest of it.

1361
01:16:02,251 --> 01:16:05,940
Obviously it's everything just
recorded and stored. Obviously.

1362
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:09,110
It's amazing that anybody would
think that's a good idea. Right?

1363
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:13,090
It's really amazing that anyone would say,
yeah,

1364
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:15,580
this is what people are gonna go for this.
This is a good,

1365
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:19,810
none of them are not going to feel
like they're imprisoned at all. No,

1366
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:23,440
it's not a prison stays. Just willing to
make sure that everybody listens. Yeah.

1367
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:27,370
Can't have that. That kind
of power. Crazy fucks camp

1368
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,250
the FBI is doing with
the entrapment cases.

1369
01:16:30,251 --> 01:16:33,640
I mean all of these like
thwarted terrorist attacks
in the last decade are all

1370
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,890
mostly manufactured by the FBI.

1371
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:37,490
Brilliant. Amazing. Oh,

1372
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,580
there's that one that was really hilarious
in Dallas where they got this guy who

1373
01:16:41,581 --> 01:16:45,350
was like challenged. He's
like, yeah, not a bright guy.

1374
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:49,400
They talked him into it. Gave
him the bomb. Yeah. Okay.

1375
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:52,280
And told him how to detonate and he
tries to detonate and they come in and

1376
01:16:52,281 --> 01:16:55,850
arrest him for bomb them wasn't even real.
You guys are playing,

1377
01:16:55,851 --> 01:16:59,540
make believe like you're playing.
Make believe in just Jack and morons,

1378
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:02,720
which I guess it's better that
they take them off the street.

1379
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:07,000
Then some real kind of dude and the
hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars,

1380
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:10,040
like coercing some mentally
unstable to fucking

1381
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,930
try to get to find those people. You
got to do that. Then for the Tsa,

1382
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:17,610
I liked that. I like what you're
doing and you find an idiot's gone

1383
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:22,440
years and they get paid like
a hundred gcs informants.

1384
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,020
There's actually this one case of
this guy in a mosque, I think I said,

1385
01:17:27,021 --> 01:17:30,800
this isn't the last podcast. He actually
scares people so much in this mosque.

1386
01:17:30,801 --> 01:17:31,910
All these Muslims who were like,

1387
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,970
they actually called the FBI and reported
him cause he was trying to radicalize

1388
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:38,450
them so much. It was like he
was the terrorist and they
were like, what the fuck?

1389
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:42,470
This guy is here trying to rile us up
there and then they're like, oh yeah,

1390
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:43,340
he's working with us.

1391
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:49,590
Jesus fucking Christ. Crazy
problem, reaction solution.

1392
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:54,750
One of the worst cases of a undercover
cops was without a doubt in my opinion

1393
01:17:54,751 --> 01:17:58,170
that the people in Florida
where they were uh,

1394
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:03,230
operation d minus whether you're sending
undercover cops to go in and pose as

1395
01:18:03,241 --> 01:18:04,830
high school students and try to,

1396
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:09,780
Oh my God, cause some weed. So sad. And
some kid actually like fell in love with,

1397
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:12,950
he was like, she was like 4.0 yeah, she's

1398
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:16,860
hot. She's 25. She was a, she's petite.

1399
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,750
She could pass for bag. So rude. And
would they, the craziest thing was a,

1400
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:25,220
what's that? A podcast. This American
life. All right, well they have,

1401
01:18:25,221 --> 01:18:28,490
they did a piece on it and they actually
interviewed her and they spoke to her

1402
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,690
and she was like,
you know,

1403
01:18:29,691 --> 01:18:31,510
hey these people that you
know shouldn't be doing that.

1404
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,580
They got to watch what they're
doing. Like you, you found a boy,

1405
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,680
you found a boy and you were nice to him.

1406
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:39,620
And he tricked him and the boy
tried to give her the weed for free.

1407
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:40,760
Tried to get her weed cause she,

1408
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,770
cause she asked him and he gave
it to even really like, oh,

1409
01:18:45,771 --> 01:18:48,290
he didn't smoke weed at
all. He tested negative when
they, when they arrested him.

1410
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:52,640
But they, uh, when they asked her,
um, like where they were rather, uh,

1411
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,530
when she asked him rather to get it,

1412
01:18:54,531 --> 01:18:57,740
he tried to give it to her for free and
she insisted on giving him money so that

1413
01:18:57,741 --> 01:19:00,950
she could make the arrest.
Wow. That's so rude.

1414
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:06,680
So mean. Meanwhile, here's my meanwhile
there's real crime going on in,

1415
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:11,570
this is my point and I want to say
this very clearly. Okay. Um, I'm not,

1416
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,130
I'm not a male apologist.

1417
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:16,730
I believe that on both
sides people should be kind.

1418
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:20,510
And I think there's a competition
between men and women that has rather

1419
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:22,610
unnecessary,
whether it's feminist,

1420
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:25,880
some masculinist and a
lot of it is unnecessary.

1421
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
But in this situation it's very strange
because if the roles had been reversed,

1422
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:36,550
the outrage would have been exponentially
greater if a man was pretending to be

1423
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:41,810
a high school student. And he
was a super slick, 25 year old,

1424
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:45,200
been around the block, been driving
for years. He's got a fast car.

1425
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:48,770
Maybe he's got a bunch of poetry
books that he reads and she's just,

1426
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,770
he's so different.
He still maturity.

1427
01:19:50,771 --> 01:19:55,771
So that would be so rude if you found
that some 25 year old pimp cat is banging

1428
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,730
17 year olds and arresting
them for getting them weed.

1429
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:02,810
Could you imagine how much people would
be upset and they would assume that the

1430
01:20:02,811 --> 01:20:04,940
guy fucked her.
I assume he fucked her,

1431
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:08,280
you know the girl was fawning him and
next thing you know she's getting them

1432
01:20:08,281 --> 01:20:10,940
weed for free and he's arresting
her. It's so funny. It wouldn't,

1433
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:14,800
you would never stand for it. No one
would stand for it. But as long as it's,

1434
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:17,370
it's one of those weird
things where it's like,

1435
01:20:17,371 --> 01:20:19,680
as long as it's a boy getting fucked over,

1436
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,280
even if there was a woman who
conned him and lured him in,

1437
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,170
you are grossly

1438
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:29,300
teachers,
fucking young girls students either.

1439
01:20:29,301 --> 01:20:32,480
You hear like a lot about women teachers
like having affairs with like their

1440
01:20:32,481 --> 01:20:33,500
high school students and stuff.

1441
01:20:33,501 --> 01:20:35,530
I'd never really heard the
story of the opposite happened.

1442
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,390
My name is happened to my high
school. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

1443
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,530
I don't want to say anymore.
Who was a good dude and I knew the girl.

1444
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:46,120
Yeah. Yeah. Um, what did you
hear about that in Trotman case,

1445
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:51,310
this is fucking sad. This guy just liked
to gamble. He was an optometrist, like,

1446
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:55,300
you know, just had his own
career, had like mildly gambled,

1447
01:20:55,301 --> 01:20:57,640
like 20 to a hundred dollars
beds with his friends.

1448
01:20:57,641 --> 01:21:01,600
And this FBI agent overheard him
at a bar one night talking about,

1449
01:21:01,601 --> 01:21:02,830
I'm waging a bet and he,

1450
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:06,190
so we'd be friended him and then for
the next like six months or a year,

1451
01:21:06,191 --> 01:21:07,180
just became closer to them.

1452
01:21:07,181 --> 01:21:11,140
It goes on and they kept trying to up
the stakes and basically at the end of

1453
01:21:11,141 --> 01:21:15,280
this time frame, he convinced the
guy to bet him $2,000 in one day,

1454
01:21:15,281 --> 01:21:17,980
which in Virginia,
that's like running a gambling operation.

1455
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:22,780
So he comes in and raids his house with
a swat team and the guy gets executed on

1456
01:21:22,781 --> 01:21:23,560
accident.

1457
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,290
There's like some trigger happy cop
who just fucking shoots and kills him.

1458
01:21:26,291 --> 01:21:29,920
I'm like, so, so you basically turn this
person into a criminal. Not even that.

1459
01:21:29,921 --> 01:21:32,270
I think that's a criminal
to spend $2,000 in a bat,

1460
01:21:32,271 --> 01:21:33,160
do whatever the fuck you want,

1461
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:37,210
but like that big shaped this person
and then he just, it's just so sad.

1462
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:38,970
Well,
this has happened so many times before.

1463
01:21:38,971 --> 01:21:43,530
There was a famous rolling stone
article about a young man that was a,

1464
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:48,830
he was talked into selling this guy some
marijuana and then he sold them some

1465
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:54,771
marijuana and they put together some
sort of coke deal and the FBI agent

1466
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:59,130
completely encouraged him, set it all
up, or the DEA agent, the undercover guy,

1467
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:00,450
set it all up,

1468
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,430
connected to two guys together and got
this poor guy who didn't want to do

1469
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:06,240
anything,

1470
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:10,890
just slowly worked him and coerced him
into the situation where you thought he

1471
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:13,340
was gonna make a lot of money to do
this real quick and know. Meanwhile,

1472
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,510
there was no drug deal to be made.
It was all fake.

1473
01:22:15,511 --> 01:22:19,770
This guy just completely concocted the
whole thing. It's fucking DEA asshole.

1474
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:23,610
So then this DEA asshole winds
up being a complete criminal,

1475
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:26,640
gets kicked off the force.
Okay. It doesn't get prosecuted.

1476
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:30,150
Just gets it just removed and done.
But you know who knows what he did?

1477
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:32,580
He was doing drugs.
They'd know he tested positive for drugs.

1478
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,830
So he was in it yourself?
Yeah, you have to.

1479
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:37,360
If you want to be a part of that world,
you got to do coke with them. Right.

1480
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:39,990
And so this poor fuck is in
jail for the rest of his life.

1481
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:44,670
His kid is just stuck and this was a long
time ago, the article in rolling stone,

1482
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,830
I don't know if he ever got out,
I don't know what the story was,

1483
01:22:46,831 --> 01:22:49,080
but the kid was doing
essentially the life in jail.

1484
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:53,100
You leave that there was a
major league cocaine dealer.

1485
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:55,530
They put together a major
league cocaine deal. Not really,

1486
01:22:55,531 --> 01:23:00,000
but they did as far as like he knew
and big. That's good enough. Sorry.

1487
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:00,750
Getting the box.
When

1488
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,870
you're like getting so close to these
people, do you ever think like, wow,

1489
01:23:03,871 --> 01:23:06,460
this is really fucked
up when I'm doing like,

1490
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:08,440
I don't understand how these
people can live with themselves.

1491
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:11,120
The ones who are in trapping these people
for months and months and months in

1492
01:23:11,121 --> 01:23:12,890
like befriending them and
getting really close to them,

1493
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:16,390
then they realize that they are shaping
these people and to become who they want

1494
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,160
them to be.
It's a fucked up thing.

1495
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:22,020
It is certainly that. It
is certainly that. It's um,

1496
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,660
it's,
it's a lack of humanity.

1497
01:23:24,661 --> 01:23:29,661
It's the same thing as a corporation
that can pollute a river and kill a bunch

1498
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:34,800
of fishermen because it's easier to do
that than it is to take shit and put it

1499
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:38,360
in these toxic drums and ship it somewhere
else. We all know that's happened too.

1500
01:23:38,361 --> 01:23:38,910
I was like,

1501
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:42,530
what allows people to do the w would you
look at a broad spectrum of what people

1502
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,520
capable of like what allows the worst,

1503
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,680
what allows the most extreme
aspects of our personalities?

1504
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:51,970
We could have an empathy pill.
Like I have a gene that's called yeah.

1505
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:56,280
But all the time. Yeah, well that's
what we need to engineer all the time.

1506
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:59,640
Just a really mild dose of Ie.
We just want to hug everybody.

1507
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:03,010
We will be so much nicer.
But it's, it's one,

1508
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:06,480
it's really interesting because if
you stop and think about the idea of

1509
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:08,940
engineering consciousness through pills,

1510
01:24:08,941 --> 01:24:12,630
I mean that's what everybody's worried
about when it comes to antidepressants

1511
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:16,470
and Prozac and things that people
give kids for add. And you know,

1512
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:20,040
people were really concerned about this
concept of engineering consciousness and

1513
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:22,350
what are the repercussions of doing
this and giving people things.

1514
01:24:22,351 --> 01:24:27,150
But what if they get it right? One of
these fucking nail it and it just becomes,

1515
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:29,370
everybody becomes cool as shit.

1516
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:34,640
Like they just like they give you a pill
and then all day you're on like a mild

1517
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,950
x to see super friendly mode,
you know?

1518
01:24:37,951 --> 01:24:42,600
And it gives you like a 20 30% Iq
boast boost fast tracks evolution.

1519
01:24:42,601 --> 01:24:46,290
Why not? It's not possible. It
seems like it would be right.

1520
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,070
It would be weird because what
if something went horribly wrong,

1521
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:52,440
wrong and well for the first few
generations until we get it right

1522
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:55,380
or all fucking getting pigs,
it's pretty, pretty insane.

1523
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:57,030
This generation is pretty crazy.

1524
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,990
Well, no one more so than those
people in Saint Louis. That's a,

1525
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,840
that is a really hard
thing to fucking read.

1526
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:07,460
It's a really hard thing to read to think
that that actually did happen. Yeah.

1527
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,760
It's just so weird.

1528
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:14,590
It's so weird that people can do things
that they can do and then other people

1529
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,010
are just cool as shit and normal

1530
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,960
or like dropping white phosphorous
in fucking Iraq that, that's against.

1531
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,660
What does that, what does white
phosphorous, this and Cindy Arie,

1532
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:25,510
that's supposed to light up
the air when you like drop it.

1533
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:29,190
When you look at bombing and
Baghdad, when we invaded, um,

1534
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,230
you see like these like plumes of,

1535
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:34,990
of like light coming down
and it basically just,

1536
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,590
it's such a high concentrated incendiary
that it will just cut through skin.

1537
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:42,610
Like it'll just slice through your flesh.
And so they've been using that.

1538
01:25:42,611 --> 01:25:43,330
It's against.

1539
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:47,080
I mean it's totally illegal to use during
warfare and Israel does it and so does

1540
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:51,760
this country still? Yeah, those
depleted uranium. That's awful too.

1541
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:55,060
That will never go away.
D you is there forever.

1542
01:25:55,430 --> 01:26:00,230
It's that areas like toxic. Yeah.
For like how long? Millions of years.

1543
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:01,130
Oh

1544
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:04,130
yeah.
Shelf of D'you is like

1545
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:06,590
knowing what is the idea
about depleted uranium?

1546
01:26:06,591 --> 01:26:09,250
Was that that it penetrates
armor better than anything else.

1547
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:11,570
This radioactive coding on the,

1548
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:16,040
on the shell of something like the shell
casing and I don't know what the fuck

1549
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:20,810
why you would ever use that if it's
like so horrifyingly toxic for the

1550
01:26:20,811 --> 01:26:23,120
environment,
why do we need that?

1551
01:26:23,121 --> 01:26:26,720
Like don't we have enough the way like
high grade weaponry enough that we don't

1552
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:28,100
need to be using.

1553
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:32,240
Do you know what the fuck do you
think those things are just like,

1554
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:33,620
let's see if we could do this.

1555
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,610
I think we could just shoot right through
that thing with the DEU and they're

1556
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:42,740
like, God, go for it. Just like
people watching the nuclear explosion,

1557
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,230
it was like glasses on.
They're like, oh sweet.

1558
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:48,860
I think just no concept of anything
in the future, past 10 years.

1559
01:26:48,861 --> 01:26:50,210
Like what is this going to do?

1560
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:55,300
The idea that anybody has the
ability to make that call, hey,

1561
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:00,120
we're going to shoot these bullets and
they should work a lot better than our

1562
01:27:00,121 --> 01:27:00,960
regular bullets.

1563
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:07,010
They poisoned the ground for a million.

1564
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:13,190
It's fucking million years. Listen, when
I'm getting around, don't worry about it.

1565
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:15,700
It's a million. It's a hundred.
We're going to give a shit bomb.

1566
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:19,370
We got a lot of this stuff.
We have a lot of this stuff.

1567
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:22,550
We might as well make bullets out of it.
What is depleted uranium?

1568
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:27,200
What does it look like? I
don't fucking know. Let's look
that up. Depleted uranium.

1569
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:28,610
Okay,
let's see what the fuck it looks like

1570
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:34,080
bedded. Uh, do you have
to ps depleted uranium?

1571
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:38,800
I bet it looks like, uh,
a bit. It looks evil.

1572
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:43,930
Why is there a navy photo
with no face? No, it's not.

1573
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,150
I see a, I see a photo of
it. Look at that. You and I
need to, that's what it is.

1574
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:51,480
You try to find that photo.
That's what depleted uranium looks like.

1575
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:57,070
And apparently it's just
fucking awesome at killing shit.

1576
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:03,760
Just they figured out how
to make something that's way
better than regular metal.

1577
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,270
Okay.

1578
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:07,490
Um,
so what it says is the,

1579
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:12,520
its uranium with a lower content of the
fissile fiss Ile Fussell you to 35 that

1580
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:21,290
the natural uranium and natural uranium
is 99.27% you to 38 and 0.72% that you

1581
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:28,970
don't give a fuck about this.

1582
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:31,370
What am I saying this to
people before I reading this?

1583
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,440
Because a lot of times when
I go to Wikipedia folks,

1584
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:34,670
I've never read about this before,

1585
01:28:34,671 --> 01:28:38,300
so I'm hoping that they'll sort of
boil it down for me within the first

1586
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:41,270
paragraph. No such luck today. Kids.

1587
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:45,950
Just a bunch of numbers that I
don't understand. But um, yeah,

1588
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:50,090
so that depleted uranium shit ain't good.
Did you see a wolverine?

1589
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,330
It was like,

1590
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:56,010
there's a reason why I'm saying this
right outside the movie wolverine.

1591
01:28:56,570 --> 01:29:01,110
How did she said no?
Yes. With Hugh Jackman.

1592
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:01,990
Who else would be

1593
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:05,490
willing when Walgreen for the past decade,
Jesus Christ,

1594
01:29:05,491 --> 01:29:09,370
I think he's the only Walgreen ever.
It's never been an wolverine. Um,

1595
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:13,770
there's a scene in it from Nagasaki cause
we'll ruins 150 years old or whatever.

1596
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:16,810
However he was when they
made them, I forget. But uh,

1597
01:29:16,811 --> 01:29:21,450
the idea is that he's a mortal and a in
Nagasaki, like he gets involved in the,

1598
01:29:21,451 --> 01:29:24,360
uh, the bomb. But you
stop and think about that,

1599
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:29,361
like let a stir range ability that
human beings had even in 1947 to throw

1600
01:29:32,911 --> 01:29:34,770
something out of a plane,
fly over,

1601
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:37,710
you throw something and
just wipe out everything.

1602
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:42,540
Just wipe out the whole Shebang.
Just flatten that motherfucker.

1603
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:45,510
Kill hundreds of thousands
of people just like that.

1604
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:49,460
But we needed to use it to end the war.
Save lives.

1605
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,390
See Jacqueline working out looking sexy
piece. I'll do it. I'm getting ready.

1606
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:57,320
It's hard to believe that he likes
musicals to he's a perfect man. No,

1607
01:29:57,321 --> 01:30:01,870
I think nuclear nuclear technology
is, is bat shit crazy. I mean it,

1608
01:30:01,871 --> 01:30:04,070
it can be used for good,

1609
01:30:04,071 --> 01:30:07,970
but the thing is we don't have the
capacity to harness it properly.

1610
01:30:07,971 --> 01:30:09,290
Like look at nuclear energy.

1611
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,620
We can't store the waste and the waste
doesn't go away for millions of years to

1612
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:15,860
say, what the fuck are we gonna put
this? Like yes, in theory it's great,

1613
01:30:15,861 --> 01:30:20,210
but there's this whole other component
that we're just kind of ignoring and then

1614
01:30:20,211 --> 01:30:22,610
look what happened in Fukushima
when something goes wrong.

1615
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:26,510
I didn't realize until Fukushima,
what nuclear energy actually was.

1616
01:30:26,511 --> 01:30:30,380
I didn't realize it was just like water
boiling and like these giant open air.

1617
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:35,010
Yeah. So on the same page. So
confused. This is what we're doing.

1618
01:30:35,011 --> 01:30:36,250
This as a free ticket.

1619
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:41,760
You've got a son that makes
and you can't shut it off. Oh

1620
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:49,080
good move
lines here in the u s well listen,

1621
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:52,620
listen. Well you don't know. Okay.
I've see where you would come with,

1622
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:56,700
this is an uneducated person, but I'm
going to explain to you we need that.

1623
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:57,331
First of all,

1624
01:30:57,331 --> 01:31:02,160
it's a major reason why coal
is down on the use is many,

1625
01:31:02,161 --> 01:31:06,370
many percent. Now there's a, we have
the situation eradicate. There's,

1626
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:10,000
we're basically no worries. There's
a, Fukushima was a very old design.

1627
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:14,430
We have various fail safes and backup
generators and we don't pitch shit right

1628
01:31:14,431 --> 01:31:16,560
next to the ocean.
Like those crazy Japanese

1629
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:17,981
we do.

1630
01:31:17,981 --> 01:31:22,170
We have like 23 sister reactors all built
by GE here in the exact same manner.

1631
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,500
Some built by fault lines.

1632
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:27,630
There's one on the way to San Diego.
You pass by it. You know what that is?

1633
01:31:27,631 --> 01:31:28,500
Shutting that down,

1634
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:33,920
but they said it's going to take like
13 how'd you get shut out your process.

1635
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,600
Would you got the toxic water?
Just dump it in the ocean,

1636
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:41,340
right when all the plastic bags. What do
you mean shut down? What does that mean?

1637
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:45,380
I thought you couldn't shut him down.
It seems like um,

1638
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,930
isn't there like a bunch of spots in
Nevada where they just like dug holes?

1639
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:52,500
I'll just put it here.
Do they have signs over?

1640
01:31:52,501 --> 01:31:57,450
Those are like in a million different
languages go no fucking 10 here.

1641
01:31:57,451 --> 01:32:02,440
Right? Don't dig for the next
million years. This spot sucks. Okay.

1642
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:06,760
2012 thanks. When are we doing?
Yeah, that's a weird thing.

1643
01:32:06,761 --> 01:32:11,140
The fact that they have these areas where
they dig a hole and they just put all

1644
01:32:11,141 --> 01:32:14,300
their garbage. They're like, listen, I
know this is all talk. So again, soon,

1645
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:19,300
whatever, whatever, dig a
little hole here. Drop it
off. Is this your land? Okay.

1646
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:23,620
Can we just dig holes here? Can we just
pay you like a couple of g suite? Listen,

1647
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,860
you guys can have prostitution
and gambling. Yeah.

1648
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:29,080
Oh you mean what they've done
to it in your reservations?

1649
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:30,190
And that's pretty much what they did.

1650
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:34,770
They're just like everyone just gone was
toxic areas with like no ability to like

1651
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:38,000
farm or do anything and will just
fucking give you gambling here.

1652
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:41,390
Aren't you happy here or gamble? Here's
a free here's of alcohol, cigarettes.

1653
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,990
If you think about it that way,
that's a weird way of looking at it.

1654
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:47,560
But I guess a lot of, uh, native
Americans would agree with you on that.

1655
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:50,470
They've don't live in the best spots.

1656
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:55,300
They don't give like the best spots
away for, for reservations. You know,

1657
01:32:55,310 --> 01:33:00,040
they're like, can we have
Hawaii? No, no, nope.

1658
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:06,340
Okay. Know, like how many,
like really good spots where
the Indians were. We like,

1659
01:33:06,341 --> 01:33:07,360
no,
not this one bitch.

1660
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,200
And there's a lot of really good spots
and Indians had where can't we build?

1661
01:33:11,201 --> 01:33:14,500
Okay, go there. I, yeah,
I'm wanting to know. I've,

1662
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:17,680
I've read a bunch of different versions
of why they were called Indians.

1663
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:21,690
Some that makes sense that some
that don't, but there's no denying

1664
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:27,320
that, uh, that name. The
uh, the idea that I've,

1665
01:33:27,321 --> 01:33:30,920
I've read two different versions of the
idea that they thought that they were

1666
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:31,910
actually in India.

1667
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:37,040
I've read that that was the case and then
also read that it was based on a word.

1668
01:33:37,041 --> 01:33:39,740
I'm trying to remember what it was.
Something meaning free man,

1669
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,613
India or something.

1670
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:43,410
I like that.
The indigo choke Chubby.

1671
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:49,060
It's not a band. Indigo girls. How are
they? Are they good children? Is like,

1672
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:53,200
we can't play them, but we have fan.
Brian. I've too much a penis for that.

1673
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:57,720
What are you trying to say? That you
can't be a man who was well endowed,

1674
01:33:57,730 --> 01:34:01,390
who enjoys some chick music? No, I think
they're more attracted to the culture.

1675
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:04,600
They're more attracted
to that culture share.

1676
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:09,190
What the fuck are you saying?
That's like shit.

1677
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:14,770
Indigo girls are like share men are more
attracted to men or women or lesbian.

1678
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:19,370
Lesbian is. Okay. Did you guys hear
about this? A this a boa constrictor.

1679
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,740
The got out of a,

1680
01:34:20,741 --> 01:34:25,180
a pet store and climbed through
the walls and into this kid's room.

1681
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:29,830
Killed a five year old and a seven year
old. Oh my God. Yeah. I was in Canada.

1682
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:32,430
Apparently climbed over the wall
of someone to just house. No,

1683
01:34:32,431 --> 01:34:35,710
it was in like they had like a
reptile place downstairs. Oh,

1684
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,410
in this fucking thing got out or fine.
Yeah.

1685
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:42,710
All these idiots that actually have
exotic pets as pets here in this country.

1686
01:34:42,711 --> 01:34:45,500
Did you know that there's more tigers
in captivity in the u s and there was in

1687
01:34:45,501 --> 01:34:48,710
the wild in the world. Really? Yes.

1688
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:54,130
We only Louis through did you
knew who but I don't believe that.

1689
01:34:55,011 --> 01:34:56,050
Now Louis through this,

1690
01:34:56,090 --> 01:35:01,090
this awesome that works for the
BBC does these crazy families.

1691
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:04,250
He lives with the Westboro
Baptist church for like a month.

1692
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:08,390
He'll go live with like all these assholes
who have tigers in cages in baboons

1693
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:11,840
and like giant snakes and he'll just like
do this documentary about him and they

1694
01:35:11,841 --> 01:35:15,650
don't know that he's actually mocking
them because he's like British and so they

1695
01:35:15,651 --> 01:35:18,350
don't really understand his humor and
he's like being really sarcastic all the

1696
01:35:18,351 --> 01:35:19,184
time.
It's great.

1697
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:23,930
Well he's also like super
embedded he'll, yeah, exactly.

1698
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:25,550
Like he does.

1699
01:35:25,551 --> 01:35:28,820
He's not like arguing with them as
much as he's just encouraged them to

1700
01:35:28,821 --> 01:35:33,800
communicate who they are, you know, which
is like, you know the hard way to do it.

1701
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,250
You're embedded with the Westboro
Baptist church. I'm like, you know,

1702
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:38,720
I've got to kill all these choirs.

1703
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,940
They have like a really
great sign making factory.

1704
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:47,320
He was like in there and he's like,
he's like Nelson Mandela Fag. He's like,

1705
01:35:47,321 --> 01:35:50,440
I don't, I don't understand. I just
like the most random assignment.

1706
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:54,340
And then had his face on his sign because
he goes back to the Westboro Baptist

1707
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:56,290
Church and then they made a sign with
him and just said like Louis Theroux,

1708
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:00,130
fag lover or something. He was like,
why did you make a sign about me?

1709
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:03,150
Our human struggles.
Just so bizarre.

1710
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:08,040
What a bizarre thing to struggle about
what the Westboro Baptist church is one

1711
01:36:08,041 --> 01:36:13,041
of the weirdest like branches of humanity
because it's almost like we expect

1712
01:36:13,081 --> 01:36:17,460
them to do something stupid
whenever anything happens
now and it becomes like an

1713
01:36:17,461 --> 01:36:20,430
oddity,
like a little side show at these things

1714
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:21,551
and if we yeah,

1715
01:36:21,551 --> 01:36:24,250
and it's like impossible to not pay
attention to them cause there's so fucking

1716
01:36:24,251 --> 01:36:27,630
outlandish, like the fact that they
will just go and fly to picket funeral.

1717
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:30,330
It's the part of the idea of struggle,
you know,

1718
01:36:30,331 --> 01:36:35,331
it's a part of the idea struggle that
the battle between like advancement and

1719
01:36:35,371 --> 01:36:37,860
thinking and this the,
the monkeys,

1720
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:42,330
there's the fucking screaming apes that
is still around throwing shit at each

1721
01:36:42,331 --> 01:36:45,600
other,
holding up abortion signs does it,

1722
01:36:45,601 --> 01:36:49,890
but it's just a part of that
fucking struggle. If you
seen that, a photo of the,

1723
01:36:49,891 --> 01:36:53,360
uh, the mountain goat and the cougar
that felt their death. Oh my God,

1724
01:36:53,361 --> 01:36:57,000
I want to see it. Hold that shit up.
It's a series of photos. It's a battle.

1725
01:36:57,001 --> 01:36:59,020
It over.
It shows a battle because the,

1726
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:03,570
the mountain lion actually has
the hair in his mouth of the,

1727
01:37:03,571 --> 01:37:05,400
of the goat.
They're both dead.

1728
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:09,570
They're laying out on a stretch of highway
in Colorado where the road was closed.

1729
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:14,520
They went to war on a cliff and they
both fell to the death. And it's, it's,

1730
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:18,120
it's a wild fucking series of photographs.
Look at this.

1731
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,690
Oh yeah.
Well see that thing to the left,

1732
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,320
that's one of the horns
from the mountain goat.

1733
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:29,400
Like it lost its horn in the process.
And there's a series of photos, Brian,

1734
01:37:29,401 --> 01:37:33,340
if you scroll down, it shows, that's
where the horn came out. See, look,

1735
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:37,860
that's where the horn like literally
broke off shit. Yeah. Okay.

1736
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:40,440
And that's the mountain lion. No,
look in his mouth. You see the tough,

1737
01:37:40,441 --> 01:37:42,360
tougher look at that.

1738
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:47,750
He got that thing in his mouth and they
both went for a ride and landed boom on

1739
01:37:48,961 --> 01:37:52,350
the ground. Look at this.
Go. It's like, Oh shit.

1740
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:55,480
Boom.
Yeah.

1741
01:37:56,530 --> 01:38:00,050
Fuck yeah, no need to look at it. But
they show you the, uh, already look at it.

1742
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:03,900
If you just no need to look at that after
you've looked at that. But if you, uh,

1743
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:08,470
uh, props to Javier Vargas, he's
the guy who sent me that on Twitter,

1744
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:13,830
try to give out Twitter props.
Yo. Um, but he, um, the, the,

1745
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:18,550
the website takes you to like a whole
series of photos. It's pretty, it's just,

1746
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,820
it's not beautiful, but it is
beautiful. Like I don't, I don't,

1747
01:38:21,821 --> 01:38:24,520
I'm not happy that either one of those
animals died. I'm not an asshole,

1748
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:29,200
but they died in a beautiful, yeah,
it's fascinating. It's fascinating.

1749
01:38:29,201 --> 01:38:31,480
It's like any weird strange work of art.

1750
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:34,450
There's something bizarre about
you're capturing this image.

1751
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:35,890
Nobody influenced them.

1752
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:39,430
It's not like they were forced to do
it in the coliseum for our amusement.

1753
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:43,120
This is just something that played out
in the wild and they fell off a cliff and

1754
01:38:43,121 --> 01:38:46,960
it's like, it's, it would
have happened whether people
existed or not. Most likely.

1755
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,700
It's just a fascinating,

1756
01:38:48,701 --> 01:38:52,960
fascinating thing to see that this
is how life exists when you take away

1757
01:38:52,961 --> 01:38:56,200
language and you'd take away cities,
you can takeaway advancement.

1758
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:59,740
It's just this wild group of things
that are trying to eat each other and

1759
01:38:59,741 --> 01:39:02,950
survive and keep moving
and spread numbers.

1760
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:07,140
How amazing is it that we live in a time
where we can see all of the shit like

1761
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:10,320
the, the planet Earth series where you
can just see what the fuck bacteria looked

1762
01:39:10,321 --> 01:39:13,560
like in caves in like New Mexico
or some shit like glow worms,

1763
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,320
spinning silk or like the
goats on that mountain side.

1764
01:39:16,321 --> 01:39:19,740
And that's what reminds me of that.
Those goats that survived and like the,

1765
01:39:19,741 --> 01:39:22,890
it's like a sheer face of a mountain
and they're hunting and they're fucking

1766
01:39:22,891 --> 01:39:26,010
running around. Like, how are they not,
how are they even existing up there?

1767
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,620
Yeah, it was amazing. I went, uh,

1768
01:39:27,621 --> 01:39:31,250
I was in Montana and I watched these
mountain goats climb up the side of these

1769
01:39:31,251 --> 01:39:34,470
bluffs and they're standing in
these like ledges. It's like a, uh,

1770
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:36,120
like a chunk like that wide.

1771
01:39:36,121 --> 01:39:39,020
And they got one hook here and one of
fair and it's not like, they're like,

1772
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:42,230
oh shit. They're like, oh, how do I
get up here? And then just keep going.

1773
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:44,270
They're not like on a ledge.
Yeah.

1774
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:47,510
They're just on a sheer fucking face and
then that'll gangster was that mountain

1775
01:39:47,511 --> 01:39:51,950
line to go, I'm going to take my chances.
Yeah. It's like, yeah, allege manage.

1776
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:54,890
I think I grabbed that bitch by the
neck and just lock onto, I'm right there

1777
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,650
guy filming it.
So they waited like weeks,

1778
01:39:57,770 --> 01:40:00,680
like six weeks to finally
catch them hunting or whatever.

1779
01:40:00,681 --> 01:40:03,260
And it was like this epic chase on
this mountain side and I was like,

1780
01:40:03,261 --> 01:40:05,660
how are they not just collapsing
and falling to their death?

1781
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:07,820
The Cot.
A mount mine hunting.

1782
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:10,900
No, it was a, it wasn't a mountain
lion. It was one of those goats.

1783
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:13,820
They were getting chased by
something by a mountain liners. Okay.

1784
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,080
Oh, so they filmed that.
Yeah. Oh, it was insane. Yeah.

1785
01:40:18,081 --> 01:40:19,730
Mount mines are really hard to film.

1786
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:25,000
That's one of the reasons why
when people hunt mountain mines,

1787
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:25,830
it's a very,

1788
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:29,660
the hunting of mountain lions is very
controversial and on one hand I see the

1789
01:40:29,661 --> 01:40:32,630
point of the people that don't want
them hunted. Like they're this majestic,

1790
01:40:32,631 --> 01:40:35,870
cool creatures and it's amazing
everything. But on the other point,

1791
01:40:35,871 --> 01:40:39,020
like you've got to realize like if you
don't keep their numbers to a manageable

1792
01:40:39,021 --> 01:40:39,471
level,

1793
01:40:39,471 --> 01:40:44,210
like the last thing you want is mountain
lions like wild lions lion this year.

1794
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:47,660
Yeah. You don't want him
like squirrels. You know,

1795
01:40:47,661 --> 01:40:51,590
you don't want like pigeons just
running around gravity slow.

1796
01:40:51,591 --> 01:40:54,070
People like we'll a real problem.

1797
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:57,160
Like you need to figure out how many we
need to keep and there's only one way to

1798
01:40:57,161 --> 01:40:57,580
do that.

1799
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:00,190
You've got to kill him because nothing
else tells them they don't have any

1800
01:41:00,191 --> 01:41:03,880
enemies. The only, they die of old
age and when they fall from cliffs,

1801
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:06,280
when they're holding on to goats, other
than that, they're going to be fine.

1802
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:10,960
Did you hear about the pack of wild pit
bulls that killed that jogger? What?

1803
01:41:10,961 --> 01:41:14,410
A fucked up way to die. Yeah.
That's not fun. Horrible way to die.

1804
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:18,160
That it seems like she was with two
other people and they like the owner was

1805
01:41:18,161 --> 01:41:19,540
just like watching it happen.

1806
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:22,900
The pit bull just like destroyed
this woman and then the,

1807
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:27,640
they were able to get help, but the girl
died. I think that's terrible. Yeah.

1808
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:28,450
Horrible.

1809
01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:32,890
Yeah. And I'm also fucking no joke,
right? It's, we around them all the time.

1810
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:36,460
We get used to the fact that we for
the most part have them under control,

1811
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:40,540
but just dogs. I have two dogs
and one of them was a smaller dog.

1812
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:42,910
One of them is pretty big.
It's like 140 pounds.

1813
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,800
And I was thinking if
he just decided like,

1814
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:47,500
I just want to see what it tastes like.
You know,

1815
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:51,460
if a dog really wanted to do that,
we were pretty sure they're not going to,

1816
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,910
what do they really want it to?
It's not a lot stop.

1817
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,130
Yeah. It's, you know, they are,

1818
01:41:56,250 --> 01:42:01,250
they are creature that that's
their instinctual something
snaps and they fucking

1819
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:01,880
go for,

1820
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:02,830
well,
it's going to be weird,

1821
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:06,730
really weird if people do create
this synthetic sort of, uh,

1822
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:09,700
artificial, uh, meat.

1823
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:13,210
If they really do create that and it
starts being something that's sold on a

1824
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:17,890
regular basis, what are we going to do?
Like, are we going to keep grazing cows?

1825
01:42:17,891 --> 01:42:21,910
Is going to be a way to justify the fact
that you're, you're killing an animal.

1826
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:22,271
Oh,

1827
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:26,800
we'll get to the point where we just
won't let cows mate that often just keep a

1828
01:42:26,801 --> 01:42:30,550
few of them around so they don't go
extinct and just eat these fake burgers.

1829
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:33,570
I think people will always
want to eat the real animal.

1830
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:34,543
Really.

1831
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:39,700
Some will shoot them or if
they just want authentic.

1832
01:42:40,370 --> 01:42:41,810
Yeah.
It'd be like a diamond.

1833
01:42:41,811 --> 01:42:46,811
Like chicks don't like
server cubic Zirconias I just
don't know how it was like

1834
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:51,780
this. Is this the real deal?
Was this forged in the bowels
of the earth? I know. Uh,

1835
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,410
yeah. If it tastes better,
what if it tastes better?

1836
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:58,970
What if like regular meat tastes like
shit? Yeah, I'm down to, yeah, why not?

1837
01:42:59,150 --> 01:43:02,300
As long as, well, I'll let people
try it for about a decade or so.

1838
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:06,380
Before I jump in.
You want to be real careful?

1839
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:09,830
Yeah. Talk about being
Guinea pigs. Gmos. Did

1840
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:13,870
you see this thing on?
Um, there was a, um, uh,

1841
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:19,190
an article, it's on my Twitter
where the scientists put Mona Lisa,

1842
01:43:19,191 --> 01:43:23,510
a tiny Mona Lisa, the,
they drew it on a surface,

1843
01:43:23,511 --> 01:43:27,830
one third, the width of a
human hair. It's incredible.

1844
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:32,780
This incredibly precise instrument at
the Georgia Institute of Technology.

1845
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:36,560
They have printed Mona Lisa odd,

1846
01:43:36,561 --> 01:43:40,790
an Ab straight surface,
30 microns in width,

1847
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:45,230
which is one third of the width of a human
hair. Can you pull it up? Yeah. Yeah.

1848
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,410
It's actually pretty good.

1849
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:51,640
It's amazing what date is what
date it's on science space.

1850
01:43:52,251 --> 01:43:56,750
robots.com and it should be there today.
If you just read right,

1851
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:59,780
look for scientists,
paint Mona Lisa on surface.

1852
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:05,050
Just that and I'm sure it will pull
up the uh, the article. But yeah,

1853
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:08,450
that's it. That's a Mona Lisa they
made, they made that on something.

1854
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:12,850
One third the size of a human hair.
It's pretty fucking good to like,

1855
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:18,170
it's hard, man. I don't know. Wrap
your head around that. It's hard.

1856
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:23,630
What the fuck? They just froze the
light. Yeah, they did that too,

1857
01:44:23,631 --> 01:44:26,900
right? For how long? How
long did you freeze line a
minute. Does that make sense?

1858
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,880
No. What does that mean?
What happens there?

1859
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:33,330
And you freeze light and then you go
to the speed of light. What happens is,

1860
01:44:33,331 --> 01:44:34,620
so for sure for pop out here,

1861
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:38,940
how your spaceship and come down here
to fix the world. What the fuck man.

1862
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:45,320
Crazy three d pen that they can draw
like in the air now and make like a dude.

1863
01:44:45,841 --> 01:44:49,890
I don't know. Look like an image. Yeah. Oh
my God. Yeah. How much do you know about,

1864
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,040
there's pens that apparently
record what you're right.

1865
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,910
So if you write something down,
so there's a pen,

1866
01:44:56,911 --> 01:44:59,910
like if I gave you this piece of
paper and I had you write things down,

1867
01:44:59,970 --> 01:45:02,130
what you wrote down would
actually show up in a computer.

1868
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:05,370
That technology has been around
for awhile but is it why?

1869
01:45:05,790 --> 01:45:09,390
How does that work or does it have
to sync up with the USB? Yeah,

1870
01:45:09,391 --> 01:45:13,170
you like sync it up to your computer
and it's like rights into a document for

1871
01:45:13,171 --> 01:45:16,620
them. But if it, if, if you
could do it with the sync
up, you could probably do it.

1872
01:45:16,621 --> 01:45:18,650
Wifi, right? That they have it.

1873
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:21,540
Cause I saw the first one
actually when I worked at gateway,

1874
01:45:21,570 --> 01:45:24,750
they used to have them so some CIA dudes
could probably be able to hook it up

1875
01:45:24,751 --> 01:45:28,440
for Wifi. Oh yeah. Or
Yeah. Seems like it. Right.

1876
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:33,290
That's amazing because somebody told
me about this guy, um, that uh, we,

1877
01:45:33,330 --> 01:45:37,340
we actually wound up having this guy
on a r a t v show and he's a psychic.

1878
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:41,310
His name is Ben a check. And I can't tell
you what he does in the show, but he,

1879
01:45:41,311 --> 01:45:45,060
he'll tell you that it's all bullshit.
He's like, he's, he's a mentalist.

1880
01:45:45,061 --> 01:45:46,580
I shouldn't say as a
psychic what he does it,

1881
01:45:46,581 --> 01:45:50,020
he debunks a lot of what people think
is psychic, but it's just trickster.

1882
01:45:50,021 --> 01:45:53,160
He Shit, he just, he's a master
and all this trickster he shit.

1883
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:56,370
And I was trying to figure out
how the fuck he did what he did.

1884
01:45:56,371 --> 01:45:57,570
Cause it was really kind of trippy.

1885
01:45:57,750 --> 01:46:00,450
And one of the things that
I think might be possible,

1886
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:02,760
I've been just running through
this through my head is uh,

1887
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:07,290
one of those pens that as you write
things down it without like you could seal

1888
01:46:07,291 --> 01:46:09,720
it in an envelope and he has
access to the information

1889
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:15,990
that is possible today. Right?
Yeah. Yeah. Without a doubt. Right.

1890
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:18,180
It has to be about,

1891
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:21,060
they could probably do the same thing
with like a keystroke thing too. Oh,

1892
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:25,710
they aren't there it is. Two
gigabyte Wifi. Smart pen. Boom.

1893
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:30,000
[inaudible] 79. Wow. It's
only $179. That's incredible.

1894
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:33,640
What does that dude's name from um,
the uh,

1895
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:36,870
double o seven movies
that got all the gadgets.

1896
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:42,870
Their Watson,
the guy that's sherlocking who was the

1897
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:47,320
got it.
Right.

1898
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:52,200
You guys know that was one guy. What's
his name? The dude who was like,

1899
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:58,430
this is the new, yeah, the dude. Was it Q?

1900
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:00,030
I don't know his name too.

1901
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:05,090
Okay. Spell the shit in it. Yeah, I would
see two. Please look at the three d pen.

1902
01:47:05,091 --> 01:47:07,820
I want to see if I,
if I actually saw it.

1903
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:11,820
Yes. His name was Q was a fictional
character in the James Bond films and

1904
01:47:11,821 --> 01:47:15,330
novelizations Q standing
for quartermaster.

1905
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,380
Huh? Yeah. There was a bunch
of these dudes that played Q.

1906
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:27,090
Yeah. Wait, you're talking about no way.

1907
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:32,310
What does that look like? Go down
and see the image, how it works.

1908
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:35,730
So this is the pen that
you write something.

1909
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:39,130
You can write something like an air and
it would it actually just draw like a

1910
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:40,083
three d.

1911
01:47:40,990 --> 01:47:42,370
Okay,
so he's filling in this.

1912
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:44,680
Thanks like icing. Wait. Okay.

1913
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:49,790
It says doodler and then this is
going to just show up in the air.

1914
01:47:49,791 --> 01:47:54,740
Is that what this, is this the
wrong video? There you go. Oh Wow.

1915
01:47:54,741 --> 01:47:56,210
That is crazy

1916
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:01,580
how simple it is.
Wait a minute.

1917
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:07,450
That's like a pen that makes like, it's
like silly puddy comes out of it. Kind of.

1918
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,810
Yeah.
It's like that plastic stuff.

1919
01:48:08,811 --> 01:48:12,500
We used to take those little straws
and blow the little air bubbles. Okay.

1920
01:48:12,501 --> 01:48:17,240
That's stupid.
That guy's an idiot.

1921
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:22,000
Not really buddy. Relax dude.
Don't get uptight. Yeah,

1922
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:25,850
he's making a strange time. It's
actually pretty cool. It's cool.

1923
01:48:25,851 --> 01:48:27,940
But like in a bit dazzle kind of way.

1924
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:36,610
True. They just created this substance
that water doesn't stick to it.

1925
01:48:36,611 --> 01:48:37,910
So you can like put it on your shoe.

1926
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:40,770
Yeah, on it. That's crazy.
We showed a video though.

1927
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:44,330
This guy just ran through a mud puddle.
It's fucking nuts.

1928
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:47,910
You scientists and it's all

1929
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:51,890
[inaudible] so fucking quick.
Every day there's some new thing.

1930
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:56,370
If only we had the most smart minds in
the world working toward technologies

1931
01:48:56,371 --> 01:49:00,690
that are good instead of like weapons.
And I mean thinking of wasting.

1932
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:04,240
Sure. Yeah, you're right
where you are. Right. But we
do as well. It's almost like,

1933
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:08,050
do you ever think about the possibility,
and this might be total hippy bullshit,

1934
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:12,520
but is there a possibility that we need
a bunch of dickheads in the world in

1935
01:49:12,521 --> 01:49:17,470
order to motivate the good people to
act and that sorta like the struggle is

1936
01:49:17,471 --> 01:49:21,370
imperative in the human condition, the
Yin and the Yang, that it's almost like a,

1937
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:26,170
there has to be assholes in order for
people to push society further in order

1938
01:49:26,171 --> 01:49:27,930
for us to really recognize her.

1939
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,860
Yeah, I think you're right. I think
there's always going to be a balance of,

1940
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:31,770
of good and bad,

1941
01:49:31,771 --> 01:49:34,080
but I don't think that we need to let
the assholes get to the extent where

1942
01:49:34,081 --> 01:49:36,750
they're actually like fucking up
the planet for the rest of us,

1943
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:37,710
which is where we're at right now.

1944
01:49:37,711 --> 01:49:40,200
So if we curve the asshole's
back to a manageable level.

1945
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,940
Yeah.
Or The assholes fucking things up.

1946
01:49:42,941 --> 01:49:45,730
This motivates the really smart,

1947
01:49:45,731 --> 01:49:48,070
nice people to develop
some of crazy technology

1948
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:50,940
that eats plastic and eats plastic and,

1949
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:55,840
and it creates flowers that grow in your
mind and enlightened that doesn't make

1950
01:49:55,841 --> 01:49:58,510
sense. Stick needs to eat mushrooms. Well,

1951
01:49:58,511 --> 01:50:02,440
they'd said that fungus is actually the
best way of dealing with a plastic that

1952
01:50:02,441 --> 01:50:06,010
they've confound found funguses that they
can mutate and get them to eat plastic.

1953
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:10,430
Really? Yeah. There's, there's
no, there's, there's been some,

1954
01:50:10,431 --> 01:50:14,110
some headway in that. That's one
of the ideas coming up with, yeah,

1955
01:50:14,111 --> 01:50:17,330
it's still scary.
It's still scary when you see this,

1956
01:50:17,331 --> 01:50:21,220
the very studies about how large the
patch is and how much of an area it covers

1957
01:50:21,221 --> 01:50:26,110
and how much actual material is out
there. It's spooky. It's not an island.

1958
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:29,050
That's kind of a misnomer.
It's actually clean pool. Yeah.

1959
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:31,750
I've called it an island before plastic.
It's um,

1960
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:34,030
cause I was trying to like figure out,

1961
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:37,300
I guess that's not the best way to
say it because it really is floating.

1962
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:42,250
So it's not really an island,
but it's, it's a giant area,
man. It's big. It's big.

1963
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:46,480
It's like Texas sized. Right.
Bigger, bigger than Texas. Jeez.

1964
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:48,280
If you've ever driven through Texas,

1965
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:53,110
just imagine all that fucked drive all
the way through Texas and all that.

1966
01:50:53,111 --> 01:50:55,630
It's just fucked in the
middle of the ocean.

1967
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:58,510
I don't know if they're gonna be
able to fix that and our lifetime,

1968
01:50:59,270 --> 01:51:02,350
it's going to be really interesting if
it gets all the way to Santa Monica,

1969
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:07,720
if it just gets all the way to the
fucking shores and it washes up on the

1970
01:51:07,721 --> 01:51:11,600
boardwalk and everybody's
like, Hey, what the hell it is,

1971
01:51:11,950 --> 01:51:14,680
we'll send it to the future or something.
That's what it will happen.

1972
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:18,580
We'll create time travel and then we'll
send to all our trash to like 50,000

1973
01:51:18,581 --> 01:51:20,590
years from now and then we could,

1974
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:22,720
we can't even send that
stuff though at this point.

1975
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:26,230
You're dealing with so much volume,
you couldn't really send that.

1976
01:51:26,470 --> 01:51:29,780
Like if we wanted to like scoop it up
and put it in rockets and shoot it,

1977
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,780
you know that what fucking cost.

1978
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:35,440
It'll be so quick cause
you can't clean it up.

1979
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:40,630
So it's so many micro particles of plastic
and all these fish have formed their

1980
01:51:40,781 --> 01:51:45,430
habitats within the plastic trash swirl.
So it's like they have to write,

1981
01:51:45,431 --> 01:51:46,360
they had no choice.

1982
01:51:46,630 --> 01:51:50,770
It's like animals that were taught in
the Congo when the Congo or grew out of

1983
01:51:50,771 --> 01:51:53,920
the grasslands, the uh,
the rain forest trapped.

1984
01:51:53,921 --> 01:51:57,670
All these animals like antelopes
and the like, rhinos and shit,

1985
01:51:57,671 --> 01:52:00,220
they all got trapped in this rain forest.
It just erupted.

1986
01:52:00,221 --> 01:52:02,110
I didn't know where and
changed their habitat.

1987
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:04,920
These poor fish are dealing
with that, right? The, yeah.

1988
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:07,420
If we did scoop it up and
just launch it in this space,

1989
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,660
that would be when the aliens would land.
They would be like the angry neighbors.

1990
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:13,630
They'd be like, bitch, what the fuck are
you doing? I said, we've been watching.

1991
01:52:13,631 --> 01:52:15,960
You guys know is way
too fucking far right.

1992
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:20,500
You're okay with nuclear power but you're
throwing fucking bags of trash over

1993
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:23,230
the fence.
Stop it dicks.

1994
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:28,540
Fucking we are.
We are the shitty neighbor of space.

1995
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:32,830
Is that what we are praying and last
day, second worse than us, right?

1996
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:34,840
It's probably going to be,
you're right.

1997
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:39,340
What if they're like more advanced and
more douchey and we just end up in the

1998
01:52:39,341 --> 01:52:43,600
seaworld of space. They just
suck us up and make us do tricks.

1999
01:52:44,230 --> 01:52:45,990
Maybe that's what we're
doing here and what I

2000
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,920
realize it, number one, Stephen Hawkins
came out and he was like, by the way,

2001
01:52:48,921 --> 01:52:52,940
aliens are most definitely out there and
there we should not be looking for them

2002
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:55,310
because they're most likely wanting
to like take over the planet.

2003
01:52:55,311 --> 01:52:58,370
Everyone was like, what the fuck?
We're like Stephen Hawkins is that, no.

2004
01:52:58,460 --> 01:52:59,390
You know what's hilarious?

2005
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:04,990
Every one of our scenarios in a film
of the aliens coming starts off bad but

2006
01:53:05,091 --> 01:53:07,310
ends us with us kicking ass. Right. Okay.

2007
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:11,090
But what was the last time we went and
scooped up some chimps and shit went

2008
01:53:11,091 --> 01:53:11,924
wrong.

2009
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:16,850
You know what was the last time we
went on a monkey search expedition just

2010
01:53:16,851 --> 01:53:20,660
starts scooping them up with nets and,
and it went terribly wrong.

2011
01:53:20,661 --> 01:53:22,970
We lost control of the planet
and get the fuck Outta here.

2012
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:25,190
Like once they start kicking our ass,

2013
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:28,490
like if they can come here from
other planets, we got a real problem.

2014
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:33,110
The thing is are they real or just a war
of the worlds again and it was fucking

2015
01:53:33,111 --> 01:53:36,110
terrified. Tom Cruise one.
Yeah, it's fucking terrifying.

2016
01:53:36,590 --> 01:53:39,890
Whole Metaphor about what we're doing to
the planet anyway and just suck it all

2017
01:53:39,891 --> 01:53:43,160
up and just spraying our shit back
at us. Like it's, you could argue

2018
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:46,800
I've always done that, but we've never
done it to this level. Like they,

2019
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:50,690
there was horrible,
horrible pollution in ancient times.

2020
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:54,080
If people would get sick because they
didn't have proper sewage systems and

2021
01:53:54,081 --> 01:53:56,150
they'd be, people would be
throwing the shit out the window.

2022
01:53:56,151 --> 01:53:58,910
And there's a lot of like human waste,

2023
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:02,020
like whether it's waste byproducts
from their body or waste from the,

2024
01:54:02,021 --> 01:54:05,510
the food that they have that created
rats and the rats carry diseases,

2025
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:07,790
not created rats.
We encourage them to be in the area.

2026
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:10,460
There has always been
that sort of a situation.

2027
01:54:10,490 --> 01:54:14,660
There's always been like this bag better
now. Yeah. Right, right. You're right.

2028
01:54:14,661 --> 01:54:16,220
You're right.
It's like what we were talking about her,

2029
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:17,860
we know that we don't shit where we,

2030
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:21,860
but for some reason we sound like we
know that. Not Do that. You say that,

2031
01:54:21,861 --> 01:54:25,340
but we do it anyway. Right. People that
we show with the people crazy. Right.

2032
01:54:26,350 --> 01:54:29,780
It's a, the battle. It's the
constant struggle. The in the Yang,

2033
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,910
the good and the bad,
the sense and the nonsense.

2034
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:36,970
I'll just fucking Duke in and out to try
to get to the end point. That's what,

2035
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:42,050
or was it Orson Welles? Yeah. H
G well said. He said that, uh,

2036
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:45,260
that history is a race between
education and catastrophe.

2037
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:49,310
I've used that quote way too many
times to not know exactly who said it.

2038
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:51,750
So if you're going to use paternity,
doesn't know it.

2039
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:54,230
No real legitimately didn't remember.
Relax.

2040
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:56,810
There's all these conspiracies
floating around through the Internet.

2041
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:02,710
Better to paradise fade away
or you definitely fuck you.

2042
01:55:02,711 --> 01:55:06,100
Trying to say that was called
a conversation stopper.

2043
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:08,800
What's fair kind of porn,

2044
01:55:08,801 --> 01:55:13,420
which I go to porn like amateur or
that's wrong. That's what you like.

2045
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:18,100
You looked at amateur shit like solo
male masturbation. Backyard black.

2046
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:24,310
I like Rebecca Linaris. Oh, you have
like a specific girl he liked watching.

2047
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:29,530
Okay. The whole world just pulled the
pants off right now. Then like he's Abby.

2048
01:55:30,130 --> 01:55:34,990
Please keep talking. The best is
porn on vine. That's the best because

2049
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:41,550
my favorites a,
there's a girl named Siri ruiner pulled.

2050
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:43,980
Oh No, no, it didn't. It doesn't

2051
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,270
matter.
Yeah,

2052
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:48,630
there's tons of porn and it's the
best because most girls are just like,

2053
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:51,720
they get right to it. Like I'm right.
Open it up and stick my finger in it. Oh,

2054
01:55:51,730 --> 01:55:55,260
now it's going to loop. I'm, I open it up.
It's sticking your finger. Perfect boobs.

2055
01:55:55,261 --> 01:55:59,910
Amazing on vine. Huh? Check out
Siri Aaa. A lot of free time

2056
01:56:01,730 --> 01:56:05,930
was spent with his pants off.
I've never masturbated mine.

2057
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:12,510
Duncan Trussell has created this
thing called some in the NSA. Oh yeah.

2058
01:56:12,511 --> 01:56:16,590
He told me about it and created a website
where you click a button and in one

2059
01:56:16,591 --> 01:56:21,150
button it Google search. Just all
like the terrible shit. Everything.

2060
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:25,560
Don't do it. Don't do it from here. Don't
do it kind of here, but whatever you do,

2061
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:27,870
don't do it from here.
And they Google,

2062
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:33,480
they Google the Google searches,
like pressure cookers, backpack.

2063
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,710
I was hired right idea and it's all
in one button. I just saw this really,

2064
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:40,410
really awesome,
a parody about the NSA that said,

2065
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:43,650
here's how we're going to beat the NSA.
Just talk like a terrorist all the time.

2066
01:56:43,710 --> 01:56:46,080
Like it's shut like this mom calling
her kid and her kid was just like,

2067
01:56:46,081 --> 01:56:49,440
all right, I'm going to go blow up
the school. And the way code names

2068
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:55,200
should all start. That's actually
funny. Was it a comedian?
The, yeah. That's great.

2069
01:56:55,230 --> 01:56:59,670
That's really funny. He just overload. Oh,

2070
01:56:59,671 --> 01:57:02,220
that's hilarious. Somebody, whatever
you do don't. Well, just this luck.

2071
01:57:02,221 --> 01:57:06,810
We're lucky that already didn't figure
that out on its own or would a road that

2072
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:10,800
shit to the fucking rocks. What a warped
reality that Snowden just got granted.

2073
01:57:10,801 --> 01:57:14,400
A silent by Russia. Yeah, right.
Well, you know what happened?

2074
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:17,100
Do you know the whole story behind it
that the United States that somehow or

2075
01:57:17,101 --> 01:57:21,480
another criticized Russia for a silencing
political dissent and they were like,

2076
01:57:21,481 --> 01:57:26,070
what? Bitch? What did you just say?
Do you know who's at our airport?

2077
01:57:26,970 --> 01:57:30,960
And they were like, oh, okay, listen.
Yeah, yeah. Ed. Hey, what's up vitamin?

2078
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:35,190
Yeah, come stay at my house,
dog. Come, come hang out

2079
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:38,220
bitch.
Are you crazy?

2080
01:57:38,221 --> 01:57:42,510
Did you really say that you criticizing
us for silencing political dissent to

2081
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:45,660
you fucking know that's so silly.

2082
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:51,280
We have the biggest story of all time
when it comes to like a lack of privacy.

2083
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:54,000
This is the biggest story of all time.
It's the fucking,

2084
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:57,270
somebody pulled the curtain
back and we saw the wizard.

2085
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:58,860
We saw the wizard like it's,

2086
01:57:58,861 --> 01:58:01,830
that is the biggest story of all time
when it comes to privacy. This guy said,

2087
01:58:01,831 --> 01:58:03,360
hey, by the way, I used to work there.

2088
01:58:03,361 --> 01:58:06,750
I didn't even graduate from high
school and this access to Dan,

2089
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,810
he didn't even graduate from high
school. Right? And he was like, well,

2090
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:13,650
but I can read your email. So what's up?
What happened? And I was just a dude.

2091
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:16,260
And by the way,
we're also tapping into China's hospitals.

2092
01:58:16,261 --> 01:58:18,390
It erode that shit like civilians,
the structure in China.

2093
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:22,530
It's like what the hell?
Well, what's fascinating is
yes, why? Well, I don't know,

2094
01:58:22,531 --> 01:58:23,460
maybe they have an answer,

2095
01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:28,490
but an even more fascinating that they
chose to do this and to try to discredit

2096
01:58:28,831 --> 01:58:33,470
this guy by going out by the, with the
fact that he was a high school dropout,

2097
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,620
right?
Like this is a shady character,

2098
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:40,670
a high school dropout and drop out work
for you and have access to everybody's,

2099
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:46,150
what the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?

2100
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:48,610
And it makes you realize like,
oh these crazy fucks.

2101
01:58:48,611 --> 01:58:50,200
They thought no one was
going to check them.

2102
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:52,200
They thought no one was
going to pay attention.

2103
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:53,900
They were just going to keep doing
what they've always been doing.

2104
01:58:53,901 --> 01:58:56,440
And they can just keep pushing it and
they just didn't realize that they were

2105
01:58:56,441 --> 01:58:59,620
doing it like completely out in the middle
of a field in the open. They're like,

2106
01:58:59,690 --> 01:59:04,090
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh shit. And I
left with the media is all like,

2107
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:06,520
oh well come back here and face the music.

2108
01:59:06,521 --> 01:59:08,320
You're not a hero until you
come back here. It's like, why?

2109
01:59:08,321 --> 01:59:09,940
So we can sit and be fucking tortured.

2110
01:59:09,941 --> 01:59:13,690
Like Bradley Manning was for years before
he's even given a kangaroo court and

2111
01:59:14,570 --> 01:59:17,560
yeah. And you're not saying that,
that sounds like an exaggeration.

2112
01:59:17,710 --> 01:59:21,340
Like oh that's really tortured.
No, he, well he was, yeah.

2113
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:25,180
And this is one of the claimant's torture
and naked solitary confinement when it

2114
01:59:25,181 --> 01:59:28,540
was cold. Like they kept him
by himself for years. Right?

2115
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:31,120
Like how long did the
key claim solitary years.

2116
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:34,060
But I think it was like three years
before I got a trial. But yeah, he was,

2117
01:59:34,061 --> 01:59:35,020
he was stripped down naked,

2118
01:59:35,021 --> 01:59:38,620
forced to be stripped down naked
every night and totally dehumanized.

2119
01:59:38,621 --> 01:59:43,240
No outside contact at all. Very Sad.
It's the whole thing is so strange.

2120
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:48,100
It's like if we really wore this really
kind and and noble country that we will

2121
01:59:48,101 --> 01:59:49,270
want to think that we were,

2122
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:54,480
we would have this person and we would
use this example as an example of how to

2123
01:59:55,031 --> 01:59:57,820
treat someone who disagrees
with you but breaks the law,

2124
01:59:57,821 --> 02:00:00,490
how to treat them
humanely, how to, you know,

2125
02:00:00,491 --> 02:00:03,130
how to bring this up
in discourse with the,

2126
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:05,080
the rest of the people of this country,

2127
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:09,880
but instead of like doing
something horrific and cruel
to them and doing it out

2128
02:00:09,881 --> 02:00:11,890
in the open and doing it
where everybody's aware of it.

2129
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:13,750
It's like you showing your intentions.

2130
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:18,310
Your intentions aren't to govern the
world and govern the world and make people

2131
02:00:18,311 --> 02:00:19,880
live in a better place.
You're,

2132
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:24,670
your intentions are to enforce your
law with an iron fist. My question is,

2133
02:00:24,671 --> 02:00:28,330
where's the Apache helicopter pilot?
Who did blow up those AP journalists?

2134
02:00:28,331 --> 02:00:31,470
I'm Betty. He's living
large. Hanging out. Oh look.

2135
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:34,660
See now the guy who like did the war
crime in the video that Bradley manning

2136
02:00:34,661 --> 02:00:39,190
exposed. Just like what a, what a
fucked up two tier justice system. Well,

2137
02:00:39,191 --> 02:00:42,400
I don't think that guys live in
large and I think that guy's paying

2138
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:45,610
psychologically whether or
not he has to go to jail.

2139
02:00:45,611 --> 02:00:49,120
I meant more like on the bigger scale,
Donald Rumsfeld, the real torture,

2140
02:00:49,870 --> 02:00:52,570
like actual criminals who
implemented all, you know. Yeah.

2141
02:00:52,571 --> 02:00:54,310
Could you imagine getting
high with Donald Rumsfeld,

2142
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:57,390
Donald Rumsfeld to do bong hits?
Just get,

2143
02:00:57,420 --> 02:01:02,420
I'm super paranoid and freaking out and
then just start talking about the Iraq

2144
02:01:02,441 --> 02:01:05,930
war theory to Larry King
now worked for our t.

2145
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:08,980
He interviewed Donald Rumsfeld for
like an hour and I was like, damn,

2146
02:01:09,130 --> 02:01:13,810
Larry King works for our team now what?
That's, that's weird. That's fascinating.

2147
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,640
It's really fascinating.
Larry King,

2148
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:21,290
why is he worked for our teams that just
like you wanted to keep working and he

2149
02:01:21,291 --> 02:01:23,530
just decided after CNN just go back at it.
I mean,

2150
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:26,320
I didn't know he was
still doing doing news.

2151
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:29,020
I thought he'd kind of retired
him was doing like very nice guy.

2152
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:33,670
So He's been a very nice guy to me. I've
met him twice. It's really nice. You know,

2153
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:34,511
I think he,

2154
02:01:34,511 --> 02:01:38,020
well he hosted the third party debates
at Aarti and then Aarti like just offered

2155
02:01:38,021 --> 02:01:40,370
him a job. I guess. It's really strange.

2156
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:43,160
Well, he's iconic, you know, he's
one of those guys that people,

2157
02:01:43,161 --> 02:01:47,930
even if you don't necessarily want
to hear who is being interviewed,

2158
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:50,930
people listen a certain amount will
listen because Larry King's interviewing

2159
02:01:50,931 --> 02:01:53,210
them like,
but he doesn't like king.

2160
02:01:53,670 --> 02:01:56,910
Yeah. He doesn't have any opinion.
All of a sudden he just asks. Yeah.

2161
02:01:56,911 --> 02:01:59,580
That's how he can get access to these
people like Donald Rumsfeld. So it's like,

2162
02:01:59,581 --> 02:02:00,200
do you want that

2163
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:04,180
Gary? Yeah. Yeah. He's
enormous access threat. Yeah.

2164
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:07,530
Kind of have to be that guy. If you
want to talk to the president, right.

2165
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:10,070
If you're lucky, you
know, you have to like,

2166
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:14,660
you have to have a long history
of not getting crazy, you know?

2167
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:16,250
Have you ever been crazy at all?

2168
02:02:16,251 --> 02:02:18,710
Like probably Geraldo
Rivera doesn't even get to,

2169
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:21,640
it doesn't get to interview Obama.
Mm.

2170
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:24,990
You might do something goofy
just to get attention. Yeah.

2171
02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:29,900
You have to have like a certain level,
like a Matt Lauer.

2172
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:36,380
Matt Lauer is not fucking around.
He's taking this seriously. God,

2173
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:39,230
Katie Couric,
she's not doing anything crazy.

2174
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:41,990
She's going to ask you questions
and be very respectful.

2175
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:45,040
You can't be some wild.
Okay.

2176
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:47,300
Came out in the wake of Michael Hastings
death and he was like, you know,

2177
02:02:47,301 --> 02:02:51,260
I'm really sorry for, for uh, the
loss of everyone for Michael Hastings.

2178
02:02:51,261 --> 02:02:54,830
But he did get one of the best generals
of Afghanistan were fired and really

2179
02:02:54,831 --> 02:02:58,630
like fucked up the war. It's
like, yeah, that's, that's
great taste dude. Like yeas,

2180
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:00,590
after he dies,
it's just like tweeting.

2181
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:02,350
Well he was showing his ass.
Yeah,

2182
02:03:02,590 --> 02:03:05,440
that's what he's doing is showing
his ass to the new world order. Look,

2183
02:03:05,441 --> 02:03:10,270
kiss my ass. I'm on. Come on. Love
you. I liked that shirtless photo.

2184
02:03:10,570 --> 02:03:13,150
Yeah, he's an interesting cat. You know,

2185
02:03:13,151 --> 02:03:15,490
that's why I brought him up
because I was aware of that tweet.

2186
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:20,830
He said are fighting one of
our best fighting generals.
Like what are you saying?

2187
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:22,450
What does that even mean?
Doesn't mean anything.

2188
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:26,010
We were losing the war mean first of all
has nothing to do with this guy dying.

2189
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:30,010
Right. So this guy, did he make things
up? Like hiring someone, what happened?

2190
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:31,210
It was just, okay, what he,

2191
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:35,950
you did those like generals who are
doing a bad job. I mean, I don't know.

2192
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:39,670
It becomes a weird thing. It's
like what you know, does it arm,

2193
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:44,560
does it aid the enemy? That's like the
big question. Does it aid the end of,

2194
02:03:44,561 --> 02:03:45,371
that's the big question.

2195
02:03:45,371 --> 02:03:49,540
I know Barry Crimmins is political comic
from Boston old school guys been around

2196
02:03:49,541 --> 02:03:53,920
a long time and he said Bradley Manning
was acquitted of aiding the enemy

2197
02:03:53,921 --> 02:03:58,690
because we're not the enemy.
And you're like, Oh snap.

2198
02:03:58,750 --> 02:04:00,520
And I mean that's essentially what I mean.

2199
02:04:00,521 --> 02:04:03,470
He definitely violated a bunch of rules
and they're most likely going to jail

2200
02:04:03,471 --> 02:04:04,540
them.
But

2201
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:08,170
no problem is he's still facing over
a hundred years in prison with all the

2202
02:04:08,171 --> 02:04:11,440
charges, the 19 charges and there's
like six charges of SB and I was still,

2203
02:04:11,441 --> 02:04:12,274
but the SBA,

2204
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:16,540
the fact that Obama's actually gone
to the level that he has to prosecute

2205
02:04:16,990 --> 02:04:21,340
whistleblowers and criminalize
whistleblowers is so
fucking crazy to me because

2206
02:04:21,341 --> 02:04:24,730
he's dredging up this world war one
piece of legislation that was used for

2207
02:04:24,731 --> 02:04:28,080
foreign spies and using it just
like Willy Nilly. He's like, oh,

2208
02:04:28,270 --> 02:04:31,870
espionage act like why? I mean, what did,

2209
02:04:31,871 --> 02:04:35,500
what did Edward Snowden to do other than
tell us about an unjust law. Like yes,

2210
02:04:35,501 --> 02:04:38,490
he broke the law,
but he's exposing something that's illegal

2211
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:41,400
and unconstitutional. Like the
government's breaking the law. Right?

2212
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:46,140
So it's all relative. Yeah.
It down to that wartime thing.

2213
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,150
Especially at wartime.

2214
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:50,340
He never supposed to do anything that
weakens your government. You know,

2215
02:04:50,341 --> 02:04:53,610
that was the, what Geraldo was
trying to express. You know,

2216
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:55,650
I don't think he realized how
people are going to take it,

2217
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:59,460
especially after guy dies. You
know the guy was a reporter. Okay.

2218
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:01,380
It's not like he made things up.
Okay.

2219
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:05,460
The guy was a reporter and you can't say
can't help but remember that you can't

2220
02:05:05,461 --> 02:05:08,760
say that. That's stupid. It doesn't,

2221
02:05:09,470 --> 02:05:13,620
but yeah, in the same
tweet. I mean motherfucker,

2222
02:05:13,970 --> 02:05:18,360
the guy's life isn't even where the
tweet without reminding people of Geraldo

2223
02:05:18,361 --> 02:05:22,890
expose the coordinates like during the
Iraq war. Did he? Yeah. You remember that?

2224
02:05:22,891 --> 02:05:26,610
He like gave a coordinates here. He's
the one who fucking, how did he do that?

2225
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:29,730
He was like fucking reporting from some,
from some foxhole.

2226
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:31,290
Did he see rock and they were like,

2227
02:05:31,291 --> 02:05:35,070
you just fucking like talk about aiding
the enemy. He actually did aid the enemy.

2228
02:05:35,370 --> 02:05:36,480
He rock.
Oh my God.

2229
02:05:36,481 --> 02:05:40,980
I have to time to look this up in Amaze
Geraldo and then I think that's when he

2230
02:05:40,981 --> 02:05:43,050
got kicked off like war covering.

2231
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:47,370
Oh Geraldo exposing war coordinates.
Oh my God.

2232
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:51,270
Well he's also the one that interviewed
the soldiers that were guarding the

2233
02:05:51,271 --> 02:05:55,590
poppy fields. Do you know
that? Have you ever seen that?

2234
02:05:55,620 --> 02:05:59,670
I have not seen him interviewing him.
Was He asking them what? It's wonderful.

2235
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:04,650
This is what's wonderful
about it is because he's not
like, what the fuck at all?

2236
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,340
He's like, well, this is just
something that we have to do here.

2237
02:06:08,070 --> 02:06:12,030
Why do we never see them pull it up there
and why you would have to maintain the

2238
02:06:12,031 --> 02:06:15,300
Bobby field? It's important because
we need heroin, right? We need,

2239
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:18,710
we need a late tax for
our [inaudible] know.

2240
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:23,520
If for these people to give
us information, we have to
let them do what they do.

2241
02:06:23,521 --> 02:06:24,600
It's rather unfortunate.

2242
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:28,140
Even though the Taliban had eradicated
opium crop before we invaded,

2243
02:06:28,141 --> 02:06:30,580
and now 90% of the world's heroin
comes from Afghanistan. Yeah.

2244
02:06:30,590 --> 02:06:34,290
It has nothing to do
with it. Is this it? Yes.

2245
02:06:34,291 --> 02:06:36,720
Fox News live from Africa.

2246
02:06:36,721 --> 02:06:39,310
Here we are tolerating it.

2247
02:06:39,311 --> 02:06:43,620
We are tolerating the cultivation of the
OPM because we know that if we were to

2248
02:06:43,621 --> 02:06:44,760
destroy it now,

2249
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:48,330
the population would turn against the
marines and it would be a real security

2250
02:06:48,331 --> 02:06:53,070
risk. Let me introduce, we tend to put
all Brian Krebs therapy, third battalion,

2251
02:06:53,071 --> 02:06:56,670
sixth marines, a really a
wonderful group of marines here.

2252
02:06:56,970 --> 02:07:00,900
I know you care deeply about
this. Uh, this contradiction.

2253
02:07:00,901 --> 02:07:04,260
The fact that here you have one of
the best fighting force in the world,

2254
02:07:04,350 --> 02:07:06,930
ever rounded is one of the
strangest interviews ever.

2255
02:07:06,931 --> 02:07:11,390
You watching this opium is being grown.
I know how to adjust your gut.

2256
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:14,480
How do you deal with it?
What are you doing? Well,

2257
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:16,190
frankly,
he says part of the culture.

2258
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:19,550
So while it might grind in
my gut and it's what they do,

2259
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:23,640
we provide them security,
we're providing them resources,

2260
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:26,870
and then we're providing them alternatives
and the alternatives or different

2261
02:07:26,871 --> 02:07:30,000
crops to grow. You're getting the seed
and the fertilizer. You can do it. Uh,

2262
02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:32,840
they can, they can rotate any of
their crops now that they want it.

2263
02:07:32,841 --> 02:07:34,760
They want to get rid of their wheat
and grow cotton for the winter.

2264
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:36,040
They can that and we're gonna help them

2265
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:41,020
do it. So whatever we,
whatever crops, cotton, heroin,

2266
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:45,190
whatever, we're going to help them out.
They don't want to ruin their culture.

2267
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:49,780
We don't want to disrupt their culture.
We're bombing the shit out of them,

2268
02:07:49,781 --> 02:07:52,360
destroying everything else.
But we don't want to fuck with the opium.

2269
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:57,210
There's Geraldo manscaping wearing towels.
Oh yeah.

2270
02:07:58,030 --> 02:08:02,850
I can't.
It hurts my feelings ordinance.

2271
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:06,490
Oh Man. Yeah. This is the
drug war is so ridiculous.

2272
02:08:06,491 --> 02:08:07,660
When you look at something like that,

2273
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:13,220
it'll take care [inaudible]
2003 10 years ago,

2274
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:15,730
Fox News channel correspondent,

2275
02:08:15,731 --> 02:08:19,300
Geraldo Rivera as being expelled
from my rack for broadcasting.

2276
02:08:19,301 --> 02:08:23,530
Details about future US troop movements
in the country. Hey, per fucked up.

2277
02:08:23,531 --> 02:08:27,370
You made a mistake. Handsome, faster
though. Still even at this age,

2278
02:08:27,371 --> 02:08:31,870
still rocking that, that Harry
Reems mustache. Yup. Hey,

2279
02:08:31,890 --> 02:08:35,800
you made a mistake. I'm sure he didn't
mean to do it. Whatever, whatever.

2280
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:40,150
Just out there. Heroin Cop, and if
we're talking about aiding the enemy,

2281
02:08:40,151 --> 02:08:42,460
it is a pretty funny thing.
He fucked up.

2282
02:08:42,730 --> 02:08:45,730
He didn't mean he didn't mean I don't
think he willingly did it right.

2283
02:08:45,731 --> 02:08:50,320
Is it the idea? Is it Bradley manning
willingly did it? Well, Bradley Manning,

2284
02:08:50,321 --> 02:08:54,250
what he did was start the dialogue and
that's what Julian Assange's did too.

2285
02:08:54,251 --> 02:08:59,251
He started the dialog and these guys are
all obviously vilified and turned into

2286
02:08:59,381 --> 02:09:03,250
monsters because they started the dialog.
But look at that.

2287
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:06,910
Oh Shit, Geraldo. It's just
really, really, really fucked up.

2288
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,950
Here's what really fucked up the tower
was way too low dog for anybody that's

2289
02:09:11,951 --> 02:09:13,670
way too low for Justin Bieber.

2290
02:09:13,671 --> 02:09:17,960
Those like there's no age
when you're allowed to do
that. That's not old for Joe.

2291
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:19,660
That's,
that's too low for Justin Bieber.

2292
02:09:19,661 --> 02:09:23,950
It's tool for John Meyer and it's too
old for her role, so it covers all bases.

2293
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:29,160
It covers like young teens or 20s
it covers thirties enhance of.

2294
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:34,180
He had John Myers Goddamn Stud.
He's a walking God, but you can't,

2295
02:09:34,181 --> 02:09:35,680
I don't want to see your
fucking phones. Right, right.

2296
02:09:35,710 --> 02:09:38,680
That's the call them the kids these days.
They call them the fuck bones,

2297
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:42,670
the upper musculature of the hips. I
don't need to see that. Those fuck bones.

2298
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:46,420
Yeah, he fucked up. He's crazy.
He's crazy for showing us so much.

2299
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:50,740
If the guy just had a nice pair of
boxer shorts on. Did Bush paint that?

2300
02:09:50,741 --> 02:09:54,880
You heard about Bush painting,
right? Yeah. He paints a
lot of Cox, right bathtub.

2301
02:09:55,060 --> 02:09:56,770
He paints himself in the bathtub.
Oh,

2302
02:09:56,980 --> 02:10:00,250
he does his painting while he's in
the bathtub. He painted himself.

2303
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:03,550
That's the paintings that
he painted was his sad face.

2304
02:10:03,551 --> 02:10:07,810
Looking in a mirror and then like his
naked body in the bathtub? No. Which Bush?

2305
02:10:08,110 --> 02:10:12,970
Bush jr. Oh God. Yeah. Do you imagine the
nightmares floating around that? So I'm,

2306
02:10:12,971 --> 02:10:16,810
that guy is mine. He probably
didn't even want to do that job.

2307
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:19,490
Just kicking it. Painting. Yeah.

2308
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:21,890
But hanging around a bunch
of dudes with machine guns,

2309
02:10:21,891 --> 02:10:24,010
just looking left and right.
Everywhere you go.

2310
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:26,410
Did you ever see that video
of George Herbert Walker?

2311
02:10:26,650 --> 02:10:30,430
He went into a restaurant and
this guy just starts screaming,

2312
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:34,320
you're a war crime at all.
Awesome war crime at o.

2313
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:35,050
And it's,

2314
02:10:35,050 --> 02:10:38,710
it's really freaky because, uh, you
know, no one knows how to deal with it.

2315
02:10:38,711 --> 02:10:40,540
This guy's obviously
willing to get arrested.

2316
02:10:40,570 --> 02:10:43,840
There's all these secret service
guys and you know, he's this old man,

2317
02:10:43,841 --> 02:10:45,400
this old rickety man and he's walking,

2318
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:48,100
at least I hope these people are hounded
for the rest of their lives and tried

2319
02:10:48,101 --> 02:10:51,340
to be put under citizen's arrest and
they can't travel because they're wanted

2320
02:10:51,341 --> 02:10:52,870
for war crimes and other countries.

2321
02:10:52,871 --> 02:10:56,800
They've already been declared like
under a international courts to be a war

2322
02:10:56,801 --> 02:10:57,250
criminal.

2323
02:10:57,250 --> 02:11:01,570
I hope that they fucking live in suffer
every time they go out in public.

2324
02:11:01,930 --> 02:11:02,763
Fuck these people.

2325
02:11:02,820 --> 02:11:06,050
Oh, I hope they take mushrooms and
apologize. Yeah, that would be great.

2326
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:07,280
Is this all bushes drawings?

2327
02:11:08,190 --> 02:11:13,070
[inaudible] you find the one in the
bathtub because these ones were actually

2328
02:11:13,071 --> 02:11:16,670
hacked. Someone hacked into his
email account or something and found,

2329
02:11:16,671 --> 02:11:18,590
so he's only released
the ones that are dogs,

2330
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:22,850
but he does find the bush in the bathtub.
Dude.

2331
02:11:23,030 --> 02:11:25,150
It's fucking weird. Did you read, uh,

2332
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:29,150
with Jimmy Carter said recently that
we're no longer a functional democracy.

2333
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:32,450
Jimmy Carter is amazing. He's,
whew. That's a weird one, Huh?

2334
02:11:32,690 --> 02:11:35,030
Look at that Bush painting
a bunch of dollars.

2335
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:37,440
That's what he does are
there is there is open,

2336
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:40,370
that's him.

2337
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:46,040
There was one of his face in the mirror.

2338
02:11:46,041 --> 02:11:50,780
Go up and click on the left hand side one.
Yeah. Can even large at one. Oh my God.

2339
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:55,700
Look at his face in the mirror.
You can't click on it.

2340
02:11:56,210 --> 02:11:59,850
You can't zoom in. That's as
much as you can see. Oh Man.

2341
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:04,430
Well quite perplex looking
back at him like very weird,

2342
02:12:04,431 --> 02:12:06,740
surreal lists like inside.

2343
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:10,820
Wow. Weird. It's, you know,
here's the thing about art. Okay,

2344
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:13,940
there's one thing if you suck at it,

2345
02:12:14,270 --> 02:12:16,670
but it's another thing if
you're old and you suck at it,

2346
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:18,740
right as it comes through,
really weird.

2347
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:22,470
It's like if you're not a thing,
if your Bush,

2348
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:25,970
if you're a fucking eight year old
and you just learning how to paint,

2349
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:29,240
that's one thing. But there's
something strange and I don't know why.

2350
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:33,890
How about someone who's really old?
That paints that sucks, dude, move on.

2351
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:35,300
You're not good.

2352
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:38,180
And you think it's the drawing is one
of those things that you either have a

2353
02:12:38,181 --> 02:12:42,230
talent for. You don't like. Singing
is clearly that way. Singing to me,

2354
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:45,050
like I have zero singing talent,
so I know that I can't do it,

2355
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:48,350
but I've see people saying that don't
have any lessons at all and they just have

2356
02:12:48,351 --> 02:12:52,220
a voice that just can carry a note. Do
you think that's the way withdrawing too?

2357
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:53,510
No, I think, I think

2358
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:56,820
art is different because there's so
many different mediums and I think that

2359
02:12:56,821 --> 02:13:01,320
we've been conditioned as a society to
not approach art and think that, oh,

2360
02:13:01,321 --> 02:13:05,730
we're not artistic and stuff because
really imagination and art are what drives

2361
02:13:05,731 --> 02:13:08,670
like creativity and,
and reinvention.

2362
02:13:08,970 --> 02:13:12,150
And so like every great and Venner has
been an artist in a sense because he's

2363
02:13:12,151 --> 02:13:15,630
imagining something that didn't exist.
So if we are stifled and we don't,

2364
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:17,860
you know,
by the powers that be or whatever,

2365
02:13:17,861 --> 02:13:21,300
and art and music are the first things
cut from public education and really it's

2366
02:13:21,301 --> 02:13:23,130
fucking up society because people,

2367
02:13:23,430 --> 02:13:27,570
when they don't express themselves
artistically in any sort of fashion,

2368
02:13:27,571 --> 02:13:32,160
then that's inhibiting their
own like personal growth
and Catharsis. Yeah. I think

2369
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:35,560
what we were talking about earlier about
men needing some sort of competition

2370
02:13:35,561 --> 02:13:39,860
and sometimes women as well, I think
people need a focus that it's, it,

2371
02:13:39,870 --> 02:13:43,470
it really helps us to figure things out
because we don't have to figure out how

2372
02:13:43,471 --> 02:13:44,010
to do it.

2373
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:46,870
You look at this,
the photo so weird.

2374
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:50,200
It's so weird even in low resolution

2375
02:13:51,570 --> 02:13:54,180
cause we don't have to uh,
figure out a way to

2376
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:59,520
hunt or fish or defend against enemies.
We have this,

2377
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:03,900
we have this like need to like make
progress and make things happen and figure

2378
02:14:03,901 --> 02:14:07,290
things out. And creating is
one great way to do it. Yeah.

2379
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:09,150
It's like yeah I was sitting
down doing something,

2380
02:14:09,151 --> 02:14:11,010
figuring out how to write a
story of figuring out how to,

2381
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:15,480
do you think that's why so many people
have anxiety now because and as we've

2382
02:14:15,481 --> 02:14:16,620
evolved as humans,

2383
02:14:16,621 --> 02:14:21,420
we needed like huge adrenaline rushes
to go hunt or to do things like that and

2384
02:14:21,421 --> 02:14:22,250
fight and,

2385
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:25,080
and getting these altercations and now
we just have this kind of mundane lives

2386
02:14:25,081 --> 02:14:27,690
where you go to work and sitting in front
of computer and we're so we have like

2387
02:14:27,691 --> 02:14:31,420
this mild just adrenaline
like anxiety all.

2388
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:34,630
I totally think that's part of it.
I think the,

2389
02:14:34,631 --> 02:14:37,950
the people that I know that have the
least amount of that or people that engage

2390
02:14:37,951 --> 02:14:41,790
in a lot of martial arts, like my,
most of my friends that do Jujitsu,

2391
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,020
I liked the calmest,

2392
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:47,250
easiest going people to be around because
they're just constantly doing that.

2393
02:14:47,251 --> 02:14:50,010
It's a,
it becomes a part of their every day life.

2394
02:14:50,011 --> 02:14:52,980
This sort of like physical struggle so
that they don't need it and they don't

2395
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:55,650
look for it in other ways and
their body doesn't look for it.

2396
02:14:55,850 --> 02:14:59,910
That that sort of like constant buzz of
anxiety could easily be attributed to

2397
02:14:59,911 --> 02:15:03,270
not blowing it out of your system,
not exercising your system,

2398
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:08,430
sort of like a sexual thing all the time.
Sitting, sitting is terrible for you.

2399
02:15:08,431 --> 02:15:12,120
Horrible. Kelly start one of the guys
that I've had on my podcast, he's a,

2400
02:15:12,121 --> 02:15:15,660
I'm a strength and conditioning specialist
specialist and he's got a phd in

2401
02:15:15,661 --> 02:15:18,150
something Super Smart and uh,
he was explaining,

2402
02:15:18,151 --> 02:15:22,200
he a doctor and he's explaining
how the sitting is the new smoking.

2403
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:25,260
Like what's terrible for your body
and your spine, your back. Like,

2404
02:15:25,261 --> 02:15:27,770
people are like slumped over and you know,

2405
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:31,830
like terrible posture and push all these
pressure, this pressure on your discs.

2406
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:34,440
They've either found that girls in north,
not girls,

2407
02:15:34,441 --> 02:15:37,120
people in North Korea are getting,
um,

2408
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:41,460
disc issues because of phones because
they're looking down all the time.

2409
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:44,910
And so they're getting bulging discs in
the back of their neck because of their

2410
02:15:44,911 --> 02:15:49,170
fucking, their, their posture, their
constant posture. Here's something crazy.

2411
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:53,850
Weed is legal in North Korea.
Wow. Yeah, I heard that.

2412
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:55,370
I heard that.
I blocked it out.

2413
02:15:55,410 --> 02:15:57,810
Such a weird thing that
doesn't drive with [inaudible]

2414
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:00,570
I think we know about. Yeah. But
if you smell good, they eat you.

2415
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:04,050
They serve you to their
political prisoners.

2416
02:16:04,051 --> 02:16:07,110
Maybe that's why they act the way
they are because they're just super,

2417
02:16:07,111 --> 02:16:11,270
everyone's just super stone. Completely
high. Everyone's out to get him

2418
02:16:11,590 --> 02:16:12,570
fucking tooth is Riley.

2419
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:18,300
Yeah. Can I grab it? Yeah.
Did you ever seen that? Um,

2420
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:22,410
vice special on a North Korea when
they went to North Korea? Tons. Rodman.

2421
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:27,100
That was so weird. It was so weird.
One of the strangest happened.

2422
02:16:27,330 --> 02:16:30,460
He's like,
I just wanted to say behalf of my country.

2423
02:16:30,770 --> 02:16:33,730
You're like, why is Dennis Rodman's did
you want me out of the country? Got sure.

2424
02:16:33,731 --> 02:16:36,880
Go for it. Well, interesting. It was
cool. If you had to choose 10 people,

2425
02:16:36,881 --> 02:16:41,430
he definitely be there. 10 people to
represent the U S I mean, I thought it was

2426
02:16:41,510 --> 02:16:44,640
cool that he, he, yeah, it was,
it was fascinating that the,

2427
02:16:44,641 --> 02:16:48,500
like the Harlem Globe trotters would go
there and be like, I was just bizarre.

2428
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:50,880
Well, he's a big basketball
fan and the new, the young,

2429
02:16:50,881 --> 02:16:53,740
the young guy who's running things
is, he's fairly young. Let's see.

2430
02:16:53,750 --> 02:16:58,350
He's like the 15 I think he's older than
that, but uh, I think he's fairly young.

2431
02:16:58,380 --> 02:17:02,850
How old is it, Kim Jong now he can't see.
That's the thing. I can't tell the age.

2432
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:04,340
Oh,
are you being raised?

2433
02:17:08,770 --> 02:17:13,070
No, that's a compliment. Kim.
Jon Did it too. Oh my God.

2434
02:17:13,071 --> 02:17:17,990
He's 29 years old. He Shit. That's
so crazy. It looks a lot younger.

2435
02:17:18,020 --> 02:17:22,520
Wow. That's still extremely young. He's
29 years old. Weapon runs the country,

2436
02:17:22,521 --> 02:17:24,410
got nukes.
That's kind of,

2437
02:17:24,990 --> 02:17:29,480
that might be one of the craziest things
I've ever read that a 29 year old would

2438
02:17:29,481 --> 02:17:31,370
be able to run a country
with nuclear bombs,

2439
02:17:31,850 --> 02:17:35,540
a military dictatorship
with nuclear bombs. He's,

2440
02:17:35,541 --> 02:17:37,490
the supreme leader says what it says here,

2441
02:17:38,390 --> 02:17:40,580
Kim Jong Un is a supreme leader,

2442
02:17:40,970 --> 02:17:45,890
son of Kim Jong Il and the
grandson of Kim, he sung, Whoa,

2443
02:17:46,510 --> 02:17:47,930
where are we live in strange times.

2444
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:49,330
Yeah. But then you know, I've,

2445
02:17:49,331 --> 02:17:53,260
I've actually got my horizons had been
brought in about North Korea a lot

2446
02:17:53,261 --> 02:17:57,250
because I've realized that there's a lot
of disinformation about why the country

2447
02:17:57,251 --> 02:17:59,830
is the way it is and it has a
lot to do with the Korean War,

2448
02:17:59,831 --> 02:18:00,730
which is something we very,

2449
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:05,080
we know very little about and why there's
a demilitarized zone and why really

2450
02:18:05,081 --> 02:18:05,800
has a lot to do with,

2451
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:09,880
with a u s policy kind of forcing them
into this fortress like mentality that

2452
02:18:09,881 --> 02:18:12,820
they feel like they have to act like
they're going to use nuclear bombs on,

2453
02:18:13,090 --> 02:18:14,620
otherwise we're going
to fucking take 'em out.

2454
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:17,920
So it's almost like a self preservation.
I mean, I'm not justifying it.

2455
02:18:17,921 --> 02:18:19,950
I'm just saying,
you know,

2456
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:23,650
it's kind of these last remaining
independent states in the world who aren't

2457
02:18:23,651 --> 02:18:26,590
completely overtaken by hegemony,

2458
02:18:26,830 --> 02:18:30,010
need to either act like they have nuclear
bombs and they're gonna use them or

2459
02:18:30,011 --> 02:18:32,380
they're going to get fucking
taken out. Look at Libya, Iraq,

2460
02:18:33,220 --> 02:18:36,580
serious in the, you know,
the cross hairs. Now

2461
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:38,810
what do you think, I mean, you're,

2462
02:18:38,811 --> 02:18:41,900
you're a person who pays
way more attention to the
political atmosphere than I

2463
02:18:41,901 --> 02:18:44,270
am. What do you think's going to
happen in the next 10, 20 years?

2464
02:18:44,990 --> 02:18:47,630
If you had to guess, how do you
think this is all gonna play out?

2465
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:53,040
I think that arrogant empires always
fall and we definitely are living in one.

2466
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:56,340
Um, and we need, unless we scale back,

2467
02:18:56,341 --> 02:19:00,540
unless something happens within the u
s to try to maintain and preserve this

2468
02:19:00,541 --> 02:19:04,050
country from collapsing, I
think we're going to see, uh,

2469
02:19:05,010 --> 02:19:06,960
some fucked up shit go on
in the Middle East. We're,

2470
02:19:06,961 --> 02:19:11,670
we're driving such instability
in the Middle East. If you
look back at US policy,

2471
02:19:11,870 --> 02:19:12,090
you know,

2472
02:19:12,090 --> 02:19:15,090
we look at the Middle East is like this
clash of civilizations and we're kind of

2473
02:19:15,091 --> 02:19:17,610
trained to say,
oh these people are barbaric,

2474
02:19:17,611 --> 02:19:20,160
they're so behind where
the western world is.

2475
02:19:20,161 --> 02:19:22,920
But really ignoring the fact that
the US had been propping up military

2476
02:19:22,921 --> 02:19:26,690
dictatorships and Mubarak
and sponsoring his, you know,

2477
02:19:26,750 --> 02:19:29,870
militarism for the last 50 years and it
also in Afghanistan were the ones who

2478
02:19:29,871 --> 02:19:32,600
radicalized Islam there
and propped up in Lawton.

2479
02:19:32,601 --> 02:19:36,140
And I mean where would those countries
be if it weren't for us kind of

2480
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:39,890
suppressing that growth and
evolution in those cultures.

2481
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:44,930
And it's really turned them more Islamic
and more like radical and that in that,

2482
02:19:44,931 --> 02:19:49,460
right. So I think that
we've really cultivated this
schism in the region that's,

2483
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:52,490
that's created a lot of this
instability and like look at a rock.

2484
02:19:52,491 --> 02:19:56,780
It's a fucking civil war. Why?
Because we fucked up the country,

2485
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:02,360
we fucked that shit up for 10 years and
we just bounce and we're like, whatever,

2486
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:03,470
your rocks just fucked.

2487
02:20:03,471 --> 02:20:06,020
And then it's on the border of Syria
in Syria is doing the same thing.

2488
02:20:06,021 --> 02:20:10,880
I mean it's a mess and it's, it's
a shame. I hope that it doesn't.

2489
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:16,720
I see it going into a full on civil
war there in Iraq and Syria and it just

2490
02:20:17,061 --> 02:20:20,250
depends on what the u s going to do
because the u s paves the way in terms of

2491
02:20:20,251 --> 02:20:24,260
road policy. So I don't think Obama
wants to get involved in Syria.

2492
02:20:24,261 --> 02:20:25,970
I think he's trying to do
everything you can and not,

2493
02:20:26,450 --> 02:20:30,550
but I think there's a lot of pressure
from a lot of people to get in there. Oh,

2494
02:20:30,980 --> 02:20:31,730
but that's going to be

2495
02:20:31,730 --> 02:20:36,660
fucking deal. More wars, more whores,
dude in fucking God. More wars.

2496
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:40,140
You know, we had Dan Carlin
on from hardcore history.

2497
02:20:40,170 --> 02:20:43,170
You ever listen to that podcast? I
have heard about it. Fucking amazing.

2498
02:20:43,410 --> 02:20:46,290
One of his most bad ass
podcast is about the goals.

2499
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:51,620
And he told a story about how the Mongols
invaded Iraq and the 12 hundreds and

2500
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:53,940
essentially it never covered the killed.

2501
02:20:53,941 --> 02:20:57,060
Everybody killed everybody through all
their work into the ocean or into the

2502
02:20:57,061 --> 02:20:57,600
river.

2503
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:01,410
The river was black with ink and red
with blood and like they just slaughtered

2504
02:21:01,411 --> 02:21:02,100
the town.

2505
02:21:02,100 --> 02:21:04,830
And they said that this was in the 12
hundreds and he was talking about how

2506
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:07,170
scholars have argued that.
And today,

2507
02:21:07,171 --> 02:21:12,090
like even in 2013 never really recovered,
sort of recovered a little bit,

2508
02:21:12,091 --> 02:21:14,160
but it was always like,
it was at one point in time,

2509
02:21:14,161 --> 02:21:18,090
it was one of the highest levels of,
of,

2510
02:21:18,150 --> 02:21:20,970
of culture and intellect in the world.
Like the,

2511
02:21:20,971 --> 02:21:24,330
the Islamic world had many scientists,
many scholars,

2512
02:21:24,331 --> 02:21:25,650
many poets and all these different,

2513
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:29,490
really an intelligent and well respected
people as far as the intellectuals of

2514
02:21:29,491 --> 02:21:32,610
the day. They killed all of
them. They killed all of them.

2515
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:35,460
They threw all their work into the river.
They,

2516
02:21:35,490 --> 02:21:39,480
the literally wiped out the town and all
that they learned and all of they had

2517
02:21:39,481 --> 02:21:42,300
accumulated all of that. The
Mongols just destroyed it all. Yeah.

2518
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:45,570
And then we came along,
you know, 2000 whatever.

2519
02:21:45,571 --> 02:21:48,810
And one more time just
to the ground again.

2520
02:21:49,550 --> 02:21:54,290
I mean, he ran one point, yeah. 3000 year
old Persian empire. Um, and we, and it's,

2521
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:57,240
it's facing extinction.
I mean we can weave,

2522
02:21:57,690 --> 02:22:01,370
we can decide whether or not we're going
to completely fuck up that, that region,

2523
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:06,130
the world. But yeah, I mean a rock and
then the looting of all these ancient, um,

2524
02:22:06,150 --> 02:22:09,480
libraries and museums there. I
mean, all these ancient artifacts.

2525
02:22:09,481 --> 02:22:13,500
And then look at Lebanon,
another birthplace of civilization.

2526
02:22:13,501 --> 02:22:16,830
We just like Israel just bomb the shit
out of it and just fucking destroyed it.

2527
02:22:16,831 --> 02:22:21,690
I mean, it's just unbelievable. We
should be protecting these sites,

2528
02:22:21,691 --> 02:22:23,910
but I guess we're a little bit
too short sided to give a shit.

2529
02:22:24,170 --> 02:22:26,040
Well, it's, it's just s I

2530
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:30,690
think it's a really strange time as far
as our ability to influence events and

2531
02:22:30,691 --> 02:22:35,691
to change the world and our ability to
physically impact the world and are sort

2532
02:22:35,911 --> 02:22:36,450
of our,

2533
02:22:36,450 --> 02:22:41,130
or our ability to have evolved to the
point where we know that that's not a good

2534
02:22:41,131 --> 02:22:42,570
idea.
It's almost like our,

2535
02:22:42,571 --> 02:22:47,571
our ability to create movement and to
create events is far greater than our

2536
02:22:47,731 --> 02:22:51,090
ability to recognize the
impact of these events.

2537
02:22:51,370 --> 02:22:53,080
What do you think this is all about?
Do you think that it's,

2538
02:22:53,230 --> 02:22:57,190
it's just an a sheen that's kind of
operating almost on its own in terms of

2539
02:22:57,191 --> 02:22:59,760
perpetual warfare in the
military industrial complex,

2540
02:22:59,790 --> 02:23:03,940
not being able to be scaled down and just
like the enormous growth and you know,

2541
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:08,140
need to just attain more and more
power. And what, where, what is that?

2542
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:08,641
Well,

2543
02:23:08,641 --> 02:23:13,641
it seems like that kind of a thing is
a trend for human beings that when they

2544
02:23:15,091 --> 02:23:19,260
get into a position of power, they try to
keep pushing it. They don't scale back.

2545
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:20,850
They don't,
they don't never see her.

2546
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,670
They never get comfortable with their
salary. They always want advances.

2547
02:23:23,671 --> 02:23:25,710
They always are.
They always want bonuses.

2548
02:23:25,711 --> 02:23:29,700
They always want more money and they
want every year they want to raise and we

2549
02:23:29,701 --> 02:23:31,440
want to continue to move
forward and forward.

2550
02:23:31,710 --> 02:23:35,730
And we see that happen
where people cut corners or,

2551
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:38,280
and people in positions
with extreme power,

2552
02:23:38,281 --> 02:23:41,640
they can manipulate the actual laws
themselves in order to allow them to do

2553
02:23:41,641 --> 02:23:45,270
things that maybe most people wouldn't
agree to. But it's sort of the same,

2554
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:46,231
in my opinion,

2555
02:23:46,231 --> 02:23:51,231
at least the same sort of process or
the same sort of pattern that exists

2556
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:56,640
throughout the human race.
When people get into a position of power,

2557
02:23:56,850 --> 02:24:00,330
they tend to push it. That's
just what we do. When we,

2558
02:24:00,331 --> 02:24:04,410
when a guy becomes the sheriff and a
town and he's got corrupt tendencies,

2559
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:06,660
he starts to control the
town. And when, you know,

2560
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:09,940
yeah, it's just like t
when the technology exists,

2561
02:24:10,150 --> 02:24:14,550
it will be abused by
people almost until the

2562
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:16,730
pinning of the big mind.

2563
02:24:17,090 --> 02:24:19,550
And I think if there's anything
that's going to save people,

2564
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:23,300
it's the opening of the big mind and what
I believed the opening of the big mind

2565
02:24:23,301 --> 02:24:26,750
is that we're going to eventually come
to a point in the very near future,

2566
02:24:26,751 --> 02:24:30,290
2030 whatever years. I don't want to
gas, but what we share consciousness,

2567
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:34,370
not just be able to email each other,
but literally I can get inside the Abbey.

2568
02:24:34,371 --> 02:24:37,010
Martin said, I can understand.
You can get inside of my head.

2569
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:39,110
You can get inside of his head and
then you're gonna kill yourself.

2570
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:41,280
Once you get into his head,
you're going to go, this is,

2571
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:43,480
I didn't even know these
people like this out there.

2572
02:24:43,860 --> 02:24:47,530
Fucking shitty videos plungers
and all sorts of shit.

2573
02:24:47,531 --> 02:24:51,130
He didn't even think it fit in your
ass and it's just the the point. Yeah,

2574
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:56,200
things that I think that if there's any
trend that seems to me to be inevitable,

2575
02:24:57,950 --> 02:25:01,430
this is two and one is the things are
gonna progress. They're going to always,

2576
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:04,700
there's going to be a faster laptop next
year if the cars are going to get more

2577
02:25:04,701 --> 02:25:08,300
gas mileage and go zero to 60 quicker
and your phone's going to be lighter and

2578
02:25:08,301 --> 02:25:09,890
stronger and it just keeps coming up that

2579
02:25:09,910 --> 02:25:11,750
he's to have a problem with that plan.
Obsolescence,

2580
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:16,280
obsolescence though that we have this
system that knows 20 years down the road,

2581
02:25:16,281 --> 02:25:18,770
the model that they're going to release
in 20 years and then releasing these

2582
02:25:18,830 --> 02:25:22,790
antiquated models year after year so you
can just buy the newest version of them.

2583
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:24,100
I don't know how much

2584
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:27,960
of that is real because I think that in
an environment is competitive as the one

2585
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,050
we experienced today.

2586
02:25:29,380 --> 02:25:34,030
I think eventually the cream rises to
the top and the competition is so strong.

2587
02:25:34,031 --> 02:25:39,031
Like let's put the smartphone market
for an example to develop a smart for

2588
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:43,360
phone, get it approved by
the FTC, then release it.

2589
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:47,080
I'm not sure who's holding back shit.
I don't know if they really are.

2590
02:25:47,081 --> 02:25:51,490
I don't know if it's a simple matter of
you have to get things approved or this

2591
02:25:51,491 --> 02:25:53,720
is just what they can
do on a mass level now.

2592
02:25:53,721 --> 02:25:57,910
And if you'd like say if like it's like
Samsung Galaxy s four or some shit like

2593
02:25:57,911 --> 02:25:59,770
that.
One of the newest android phones.

2594
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:02,500
I pretty sure that's about as
good as they can do right now.

2595
02:26:02,650 --> 02:26:04,180
I don't think they're really
holding anything back,

2596
02:26:04,181 --> 02:26:07,730
but they also know that six months from
now that's going to be dog shit because

2597
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:10,390
this is going to be an help me. It'll
be one phone that you press a button.

2598
02:26:10,391 --> 02:26:13,840
It makes a Princess Leia Hologram, you
know, I mean that's going to happen.

2599
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:19,180
There's this dude from a, there's a place
in, um, I think it's Marina del Ray.

2600
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:22,410
It's called just cause it's a
and an emotion capture thing.

2601
02:26:22,450 --> 02:26:25,870
Just do named Ruben who took us and
showed us how to use this motion capture

2602
02:26:25,871 --> 02:26:29,800
shit. And one of the things that they
showed was that they can take you,

2603
02:26:29,950 --> 02:26:33,520
you put on a suit and then they put,
instead of you being Abby Martin,

2604
02:26:33,521 --> 02:26:38,440
you're a giant dinosaur or your a
spaceman or your a wolverine, you know,

2605
02:26:38,441 --> 02:26:42,310
they can just make you whatever you
want inside this game. Yeah, yeah.

2606
02:26:42,370 --> 02:26:45,700
Without a doubt. So there's gonna
be a phone within our lifetime.

2607
02:26:45,790 --> 02:26:48,850
They're going to bring up press a button
and you're going to be able to appear

2608
02:26:48,851 --> 02:26:51,910
in a Princess Leia outfit and you're
going to, you're going to be able to say,

2609
02:26:52,180 --> 02:26:56,800
help me Obi one my only hope, you mean
you could literally be a three d hologram.

2610
02:26:57,400 --> 02:27:01,210
We are definitely going to have
virtual reality with reality. But wait,

2611
02:27:01,211 --> 02:27:03,370
when you're talking to
is planned obsolescence.

2612
02:27:03,910 --> 02:27:04,251
Well it's good.

2613
02:27:04,251 --> 02:27:06,580
I get the sharing of consciousness thing
cause I don't understand how that would

2614
02:27:06,581 --> 02:27:07,540
work as how can you really,

2615
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:09,800
I don't either conscious or we're fucked.

2616
02:27:10,220 --> 02:27:12,800
I don't think it's isolated consciousness.
I think it's accessing,

2617
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:16,460
I think it's the ability to access
information and the ability to access

2618
02:27:16,461 --> 02:27:20,480
thoughts. I think one of the first steps,
and this is completely hypothetical,

2619
02:27:20,481 --> 02:27:23,870
folks, people that are screaming on
science forums, this is not possible.

2620
02:27:23,871 --> 02:27:28,550
You fucking idiot. You're right.
We're just talking shit here. Okay,

2621
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:29,510
relax.

2622
02:27:29,960 --> 02:27:32,330
But I think one of the things that's
probably going to happen is it gonna be

2623
02:27:32,331 --> 02:27:33,350
able to record memories.

2624
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:37,340
They're going to be able to put a hard
drive in your mind somewhere in your

2625
02:27:37,341 --> 02:27:41,840
system that can record your memories more
accurately than your own memory, Ken.

2626
02:27:42,230 --> 02:27:44,720
And that will act as our new memory.
It's so sort of how,

2627
02:27:44,721 --> 02:27:46,580
like you can't really
remember that many phones,

2628
02:27:46,700 --> 02:27:49,790
phone numbers anymore because they're
all stored in your cell phone.

2629
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:52,340
I know like four or five numbers
and that's it. Once those are done,

2630
02:27:52,341 --> 02:27:53,174
they're out of my system.

2631
02:27:53,390 --> 02:27:57,400
But I think that we're eventually
going to be able to get a, uh,

2632
02:27:57,401 --> 02:28:02,360
a version of your memory that's going
to be an artificial recording that's in

2633
02:28:02,361 --> 02:28:04,330
like an HD. That's
absolutely perfect. Wait,

2634
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,660
no, then that's, that's incredible.

2635
02:28:05,661 --> 02:28:07,670
But they already are doing
studies where they can,

2636
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:12,320
they have like analogs and cataloging
dream sequences and almost like

2637
02:28:12,710 --> 02:28:16,100
deciphering different shapes of
people of what people are dreaming.

2638
02:28:16,101 --> 02:28:17,330
It's really rough right now,

2639
02:28:17,331 --> 02:28:20,330
but the technology's there and it's
definitely developing. So that's,

2640
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:22,940
that's to fucking
revolutionize shit right there.

2641
02:28:23,130 --> 02:28:26,720
Those are dreams to be able
to be recorded. Hitting me.

2642
02:28:27,090 --> 02:28:31,350
There was a woman, um, I think, I'm
trying to figure convicted on her memory.

2643
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:36,240
There was a woman, um, it was in
another country. Okay. Women's center.

2644
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:41,300
There was a woman who was accused of a
crime and they called her into court and

2645
02:28:43,801 --> 02:28:48,780
tried this test on her fucking FTM.
I forget what it's called.

2646
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:53,850
They, um, they figured
out how to register or,

2647
02:28:53,851 --> 02:28:55,530
or to access her memories.

2648
02:28:55,710 --> 02:29:00,210
And in those memories they determined
that she had a personal knowledge of the

2649
02:29:00,211 --> 02:29:05,211
crime and that they couldn't prove that
she had actually committed the crime.

2650
02:29:05,670 --> 02:29:07,650
They couldn't prove
whether she was a witness,

2651
02:29:07,770 --> 02:29:09,450
but she said she wasn't
even anywhere near.

2652
02:29:09,460 --> 02:29:13,690
And they proved that she had a
personal knowledge of the crime. Now.

2653
02:29:14,370 --> 02:29:16,070
Bob Murray Basin had
nothing to do with like,

2654
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:21,240
yes, like lie detector technology
or no, no. Straight up.

2655
02:29:21,310 --> 02:29:25,290
Yeah. It's somehow or another
they're accessing memory. Let me see.

2656
02:29:25,440 --> 02:29:28,300
I'm trying to Google the correct
things. Yeah. Somebody uh,

2657
02:29:28,320 --> 02:29:32,700
showed it to me the other than that it
was, it's really crazy. This, um, I don't,

2658
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:34,980
I don't have the store in front of me.
Next podcast.

2659
02:29:34,981 --> 02:29:37,350
I'll find it folks and I'll
get it to you and shit fucks

2660
02:29:38,350 --> 02:29:41,570
you do 300 podcasts. I don't even know
where this is. You fucking asshole.

2661
02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:43,820
How about your fucking research ship?
Before you talk about it,

2662
02:29:44,060 --> 02:29:47,270
somebody showed it to me.
I'm assuming it's real. You.
I'm sure you, you smart cats.

2663
02:29:47,271 --> 02:29:48,170
We'll send it to me on Twitter.

2664
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:52,130
Did you hear about the cops and
Detroit robbing people? Real cops?

2665
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:55,760
There were real crops. What are
we in fucking Gotham city? Well,

2666
02:29:55,761 --> 02:29:59,750
Detroit Kinda is Detroit's way
scarier than Gotham city. Detroit is.

2667
02:29:59,810 --> 02:30:02,300
We were just there really with the film.

2668
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:07,360
The TV show does log island thought Zug
Island is where they make a lot of cars.

2669
02:30:08,361 --> 02:30:13,280
It's, it's mostly like a steel factory
in plant. And uh, when we were there,

2670
02:30:13,281 --> 02:30:15,870
we saw houses that were like 50 bucks,
cause we,

2671
02:30:15,871 --> 02:30:19,910
we saw found one on one and it
was 39. Yeah, $39 for a house.

2672
02:30:20,260 --> 02:30:24,170
No regular is there 500. There's a lot of
$500 houses there. You just get it out.

2673
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:25,460
But you wouldn't want to live there.

2674
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:28,720
Like they would have to pay you to live
there. It smells horrible. Like it,

2675
02:30:28,721 --> 02:30:33,620
like a sulfury burning chemical. He smell
and it's just in the air all the time.

2676
02:30:34,010 --> 02:30:37,610
And people were s they were fishing
in this polluted river. And uh,

2677
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:40,610
my friend was like, why are they
efficient in that river? It's like,

2678
02:30:40,611 --> 02:30:41,930
because they need to eat.

2679
02:30:42,550 --> 02:30:46,730
Like it's really that
crazy 47% illiteracy rate,

2680
02:30:47,390 --> 02:30:51,110
the highest rate I believe
of abandoned houses,

2681
02:30:51,111 --> 02:30:55,670
like the growth of abandoned houses in
the nation. Pretty sure I read that too.

2682
02:30:55,870 --> 02:30:56,703
I might've made that up though.

2683
02:30:57,250 --> 02:30:59,240
But yeah, we can't, and I'm not an,

2684
02:30:59,530 --> 02:31:02,110
let me preempt this by saying I'm
not advocating bailing out cities,

2685
02:31:02,111 --> 02:31:04,780
but it is just funny that the
government's like, oh, we can't help you.

2686
02:31:04,781 --> 02:31:06,520
We're going to fucking
take all the pensions,

2687
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:11,440
but at the same time we're just going to
bail out giant corporations and fuck it,

2688
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:15,640
maintain 900 bases around the world
and spend trillions of dollars fucking

2689
02:31:15,641 --> 02:31:17,410
maintaining this empire basis.
But it's a,

2690
02:31:17,530 --> 02:31:19,770
but we're just going to
neglect all the cities and yes,

2691
02:31:19,771 --> 02:31:21,600
there was a lot of corruption in Detroit.
Yes.

2692
02:31:21,601 --> 02:31:25,020
There's a lot of externalities that
I'm not taking into consideration.

2693
02:31:25,021 --> 02:31:29,280
It's just an interesting dichotomy of
who the fuck does this government really

2694
02:31:29,281 --> 02:31:30,114
care about?

2695
02:31:30,150 --> 02:31:34,950
And again, it brings us full circle
to porn. Nobody bailed out at all.

2696
02:31:35,300 --> 02:31:39,090
Nobody comes for a circle to
my neighborhood was a porn guy,

2697
02:31:39,150 --> 02:31:42,570
lost his fucking house.
Bullshit, man. Nobody cared.

2698
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:46,360
You're trying to try and get
them moved to Detroit. Yeah.

2699
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:49,590
All the people who lost out in
the porn industry in Detroit,

2700
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:52,470
free taxes and those people,
fuck you for cheap.

2701
02:31:52,990 --> 02:31:57,270
They're willing to eat radioactive
fish though. Fuck you on the cheap.

2702
02:31:58,130 --> 02:31:58,963
Okay.

2703
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:04,080
That's a good move. This is the end of
the show. Clearly we ran out of gas.

2704
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:06,990
I'm going to pee. You guys talk amongst
yourselves and then we'll wrap this up.

2705
02:32:07,050 --> 02:32:10,380
I'll come back and we'll
clean it up tight. Oh yeah.

2706
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:15,560
Dry wants to see it.
Show up on snap went off.

2707
02:32:16,190 --> 02:32:20,270
So what are these little lamps do?
There's Salt Himalayan salt lamps.

2708
02:32:20,271 --> 02:32:23,480
Supposedly they have some kind
of energy that comes off of him,

2709
02:32:23,481 --> 02:32:28,090
but I don't buy it,
I think was just a hippie closeted hippie.

2710
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:30,860
So they're actually made of salt.

2711
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:35,110
Yeah, they're made out of salt.
Crazy. Um, so your artwork, you do,

2712
02:32:35,111 --> 02:32:37,030
do you also have like a,

2713
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:42,060
like a gallery or do you have a any online
where you can buy posters over your,

2714
02:32:42,570 --> 02:32:44,520
over your stuff.org?

2715
02:32:44,540 --> 02:32:47,340
I'd be mark and check out
the gallery there and a,

2716
02:32:47,341 --> 02:32:50,760
I just brought something that I thought
you guys would like here. But yeah,

2717
02:32:50,761 --> 02:32:55,140
I do a lot of like abstract
art and political art as
well. Oh, that's cool. Yeah.

2718
02:32:55,530 --> 02:32:59,400
Did you go to school for art or no? No,
I think art school is kind of bullshit.

2719
02:32:59,450 --> 02:33:01,190
Yeah, it's kind of conforms.
You knew what they,

2720
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:04,200
whatever they think artists or whatever.
So our,

2721
02:33:04,201 --> 02:33:07,890
it just started off as mostly
a go into the collage section

2722
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:10,673
right there.

2723
02:33:11,610 --> 02:33:12,150
Okay.

2724
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:15,670
It started off as just mostly an
outlet because political activism was

2725
02:33:15,671 --> 02:33:16,960
dominating my life,
but then it,

2726
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:18,220
okay.

2727
02:33:18,220 --> 02:33:22,000
It ended up being something that I was
able to bridge the two together and it

2728
02:33:22,001 --> 02:33:26,050
just, it keeps me sane. I don't get to
do it as much as I would like to. But,

2729
02:33:26,320 --> 02:33:29,880
and what is, is this, what is
this medium you're using as ink?

2730
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:34,690
That is all paint pen and cutouts of
paper. I do nothing on the computer,

2731
02:33:35,290 --> 02:33:37,590
so that's all just hand drawn ink and,

2732
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:41,650
and collage has really cool paint pen.
Thank you.

2733
02:33:41,730 --> 02:33:45,270
Now do you ever do a live gallery or do
you ever have, have you ever done that?

2734
02:33:45,271 --> 02:33:47,000
Like a,
like a showing of your year?

2735
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:48,060
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

2736
02:33:48,061 --> 02:33:52,200
I did a lot of art shows in the past and
I did my first political installation.

2737
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:55,390
That's a line of riot cops I took a
photo of. And then just drew over it.

2738
02:33:56,490 --> 02:33:59,620
What did I miss? I miss a
lot of shit, dude. Your style

2739
02:34:00,270 --> 02:34:03,930
did I miss out?
We're looking@herartworkatabbymartin.org

2740
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:07,420
I love when a,
I don't know something about somebody.

2741
02:34:07,490 --> 02:34:10,690
It turns out they're bad acid
shit. Yeah, that's pretty sweet.

2742
02:34:10,700 --> 02:34:14,750
Like finding that you have to
look at here. Bad ass artist.

2743
02:34:15,230 --> 02:34:18,070
What's the video? Cool. Use it. Yes. Okay,

2744
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:21,970
so this is a little compilation promo
that I made of what I think are the best

2745
02:34:21,971 --> 02:34:24,730
clips of the entire first
season of breaking this set,

2746
02:34:24,731 --> 02:34:26,470
which is the show I have on rt America.

2747
02:34:26,471 --> 02:34:30,710
So this is kind of just a little two
minute a preview of what the fuck the

2748
02:34:30,711 --> 02:34:31,960
show's about. Okay. Check it out.

2749
02:34:33,460 --> 02:34:34,293
Hmm.

2750
02:34:34,570 --> 02:34:38,470
Media candidates, corporate talk.
Cracy how rude. You can't wait for this

2751
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:42,910
to be over word New York Times.
Welcome to the,

2752
02:34:42,911 --> 02:34:46,770
this administration has no
credibility club. Remind me again,

2753
02:34:46,771 --> 02:34:51,300
why does that people are worshiping kings
and Queens in the year 2013 five novel

2754
02:34:51,301 --> 02:34:52,100
idea.

2755
02:34:52,100 --> 02:34:55,770
I'm blaming the whistleblower for trying
to evade death by way of the espionage

2756
02:34:55,771 --> 02:34:56,340
act.

2757
02:34:56,340 --> 02:35:01,200
You actually talk about what the NSA
revelations are in a counselor's republic

2758
02:35:01,201 --> 02:35:04,740
democracy. This is not informed
consent by those who are governed.

2759
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:08,070
This is manufacturer consent and I would
actually argue it's core is consent in

2760
02:35:08,071 --> 02:35:12,810
secret. Guys, this is not about
safety. It's not about terrorism.

2761
02:35:13,230 --> 02:35:17,120
This is about shilling descent
and controlling society. Live,

2762
02:35:17,660 --> 02:35:22,380
live, die, die, die. Is he dead already?

2763
02:35:22,410 --> 02:35:24,900
You can't conduct these kinds
of wars around the world,

2764
02:35:25,080 --> 02:35:28,980
killing innocent people in the pursuit
of a few bad guys and pretend that it's

2765
02:35:28,981 --> 02:35:31,970
not going to come back to, to hurt
you. Did you find the logic flawed?

2766
02:35:31,990 --> 02:35:34,890
Now looking back,
do you regret your vote to invade,

2767
02:35:34,891 --> 02:35:36,990
not occupy a country to find one man?
See,

2768
02:35:36,991 --> 02:35:41,340
we ought to be critical of
highly concentrated forms
of power wherever we find

2769
02:35:41,341 --> 02:35:46,320
it, because that kind of power was
usually subject of chronic abuse. Hello,

2770
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:49,920
I'm Stephanie from Nestle.
We sold a video.

2771
02:35:49,921 --> 02:35:53,020
You post on youtube criticizing
this Nestle over water.

2772
02:35:53,730 --> 02:35:54,990
So He's all response.

2773
02:35:55,860 --> 02:36:00,000
Walmart's also been described
as an economic deathstar
destroying everything in

2774
02:36:00,001 --> 02:36:03,690
its path. Ligon behind nothing
more than homogenous wasteland.

2775
02:36:03,930 --> 02:36:08,930
So the harmless activist is now the
criminal yet actual criminal banksters run

2776
02:36:09,571 --> 02:36:13,560
free. Well, I'm glad this government
has its priorities straight.

2777
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:18,270
So do you shackled down your mind and
subscribe to old school paradigms or do

2778
02:36:18,271 --> 02:36:21,270
you liberate yourself by
acknowledging reality? Sure,

2779
02:36:21,271 --> 02:36:25,470
the world would lose its innocence,
but wouldn't you rather know the truth?

2780
02:36:35,050 --> 02:36:37,960
Powerful. Abby Martin, you're all
angry and shit. I'm all pissed.

2781
02:36:37,990 --> 02:36:40,780
You like causing a revolution
or something. I'm just pissed.

2782
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:44,840
And you don't see people
who are like, yeah, don't,

2783
02:36:45,090 --> 02:36:48,250
but Archie allows you to be pissed, but
I should say that you're very pleasant.

2784
02:36:48,550 --> 02:36:50,080
You know by saying you're angry,

2785
02:36:50,081 --> 02:36:51,670
you're kind of angry when
you're doing these clips.

2786
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:54,550
If someone didn't know you and they
saw that, they would think like, wow,

2787
02:36:54,551 --> 02:36:57,250
this is like really intense check. But
you're very pleasant. You're very normal.

2788
02:36:57,290 --> 02:36:59,630
That's funny. It is funny that you
say that because everyone I've met,

2789
02:36:59,631 --> 02:37:02,480
they're like, wow, you look, do you seem
like you're really intense? And I'm like,

2790
02:37:02,510 --> 02:37:04,880
oh, just yeah, I'm pissed off
when I'm talking about the shit.

2791
02:37:04,881 --> 02:37:09,020
But I could also be a normal person who
can have conversations about different

2792
02:37:09,021 --> 02:37:09,854
things.
Yeah.

2793
02:37:10,600 --> 02:37:15,600
Ultimately it all boils down to you
can't deny what's going on and so many

2794
02:37:16,311 --> 02:37:20,540
people are and if it's not for people
like you that come up and go, hey,

2795
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:24,580
quite honestly what the fuck is
happening if that doesn't happen.

2796
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:28,520
It's a real controversial thing and I
applaud you and this is going to sound

2797
02:37:28,521 --> 02:37:30,980
condescending, but it's, I
have to say it this way anyway.

2798
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:35,960
I applaud you for doing it even more
because you're a woman because I know that

2799
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:40,580
a lot of men don't want to hear
women talk about important issues.

2800
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:43,790
There's a weird thing like
especially old school, he type men.

2801
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:47,060
Like if you're like how many dudes
in their 50s one to listen to some,

2802
02:37:47,210 --> 02:37:49,340
how will the you like 29 or
something like that. Yeah,

2803
02:37:49,370 --> 02:37:53,810
29 year old chick fucking smart mouth
talking shit about our military or

2804
02:37:53,811 --> 02:37:54,471
whatever.
You know,

2805
02:37:54,471 --> 02:37:57,680
like they don't want to hear that shit
like old dudes don't want to hear that at

2806
02:37:57,681 --> 02:38:01,700
all. So it takes a lot of balls
or whatever you have ovaries.

2807
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:05,570
It takes a lot of ovaries. It
takes a lot of courage to, uh,

2808
02:38:05,660 --> 02:38:06,890
to be able to do that.

2809
02:38:06,891 --> 02:38:10,580
It's a tricky situation when you start
talking about shit that other people

2810
02:38:10,581 --> 02:38:12,260
should have taken care of.
It's like,

2811
02:38:12,261 --> 02:38:15,710
cause you're not just saying to old
dude's like, hey dickhead, you know,

2812
02:38:15,711 --> 02:38:17,960
like you paying attention
to what's going on.

2813
02:38:18,050 --> 02:38:20,720
Like this is what the government is
doing to you. You're also saying, hey,

2814
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:23,990
how did you let this happen?
You were the ones that were in truck.

2815
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:26,300
What are you doing that accident?
You were like,

2816
02:38:26,330 --> 02:38:27,740
you were the ones who
are in charge of this.

2817
02:38:27,741 --> 02:38:30,040
Like you guys allowed this to happen.
Like,

2818
02:38:30,050 --> 02:38:33,290
and anybody that's upset at the
way the situation is right now,

2819
02:38:33,291 --> 02:38:36,140
who had anything to do with it,
look at yourself, look at yourself.

2820
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:38,600
Don't get mad at Edward Snowden.

2821
02:38:38,980 --> 02:38:42,100
Yeah. And I think, you know, people
have told me that I'm, you know,

2822
02:38:42,101 --> 02:38:45,250
why don't you provide more solutions or
you're like me fearmongering and stuff.

2823
02:38:45,251 --> 02:38:45,641
I'm like,
look,

2824
02:38:45,641 --> 02:38:49,300
we all need to get this information first
before we can even get to what we can

2825
02:38:49,301 --> 02:38:50,021
do about it.
Like,

2826
02:38:50,021 --> 02:38:53,020
we don't fucking know any of this shit
because we've been conditioned to not

2827
02:38:53,021 --> 02:38:55,510
knowing it. The media is
controlled by six corporations,

2828
02:38:55,900 --> 02:38:59,020
six corporations that work in concert
with the establishment to push their

2829
02:38:59,021 --> 02:38:59,710
narrative.

2830
02:38:59,710 --> 02:39:03,340
Six corporations that have about 120
people sit on the boards of directors of

2831
02:39:03,341 --> 02:39:07,660
that also sit on the board of directors
of defense contractors, Monsanto. I mean,

2832
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:10,210
this is what's controlling.
That's the corporatocracy.

2833
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:14,590
The media is allowed to lie.
It's about entertainment.

2834
02:39:14,591 --> 02:39:16,860
It's not about providing information.
So it's,

2835
02:39:16,930 --> 02:39:21,930
it's a shame that I have to work for
Russian government to provide the truth

2836
02:39:22,211 --> 02:39:23,170
about my own country.

2837
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:26,650
And it's a shame that there's no outlet
here that will allow me to do that.

2838
02:39:27,360 --> 02:39:31,470
It's amazing that this is like
when we think about Russia,

2839
02:39:31,710 --> 02:39:34,230
when you think about Putin,
you think about like, oh,

2840
02:39:34,231 --> 02:39:36,870
don't piss that fucking guy off.
Like the, those people are crazy.

2841
02:39:36,871 --> 02:39:39,270
Like those people are gangster as fuck.
But uh,

2842
02:39:39,300 --> 02:39:43,200
we don't think about that when it comes
to this country. Right? But meanwhile,

2843
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:47,160
you look at what the fuck is
going on. I'm like, look at this.

2844
02:39:47,190 --> 02:39:50,460
The Edward Snowden thing
is a classic situation.

2845
02:39:50,610 --> 02:39:55,230
They're offering political asylum to
guy that exposed a worldwide spying

2846
02:39:55,231 --> 02:39:57,900
program. Who else? A spine
because the UK spine,

2847
02:39:57,960 --> 02:40:02,750
their spine to China spine.
Everyone's spine. What's going on?

2848
02:40:02,751 --> 02:40:05,010
I got Kathleen and fucking
like Brazilians. It's like,

2849
02:40:05,011 --> 02:40:06,030
why the fuck are we spine on?

2850
02:40:06,031 --> 02:40:11,031
Brazilians never know that ass [inaudible]
they they find out about you husker.

2851
02:40:14,211 --> 02:40:17,280
He has he ever eat a full go to
Sean. I read it. One of those places.

2852
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:18,720
That's how I supposed
to say if your culture,

2853
02:40:18,721 --> 02:40:22,120
by the way you don't say Chao Fogo de
Chao, you don't say that. You say Sean,

2854
02:40:23,500 --> 02:40:25,500
but it's true. Acting like, oh,

2855
02:40:25,501 --> 02:40:27,840
it's a thumb in the eye at the
middle finger of the u s well,

2856
02:40:27,841 --> 02:40:31,290
actually the u s set the double standard
years ago when we denied repeated

2857
02:40:31,291 --> 02:40:34,310
extradition requests of
actual criminals from Russia,

2858
02:40:34,370 --> 02:40:38,810
Russia has fucking asses to extradite
multiple criminals and we said, no. Yeah,

2859
02:40:39,370 --> 02:40:42,930
Ecuador. Venezuela. Yeah, but we
didn't want to write. That's a,

2860
02:40:42,931 --> 02:40:45,240
why are we acting shocked when
other countries don't do it?

2861
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:47,100
Why are we acting so shocked
when Russia is like, no,

2862
02:40:47,101 --> 02:40:50,130
we're not going to extradite this guy.
Isn't it funny that we keep saying we?

2863
02:40:50,440 --> 02:40:51,900
Yeah,
I need to stop doing.

2864
02:40:52,130 --> 02:40:56,650
I tried it too, but it's so easy to do.
So easy to go. We're the ones who write.

2865
02:40:57,410 --> 02:40:58,670
That's what pisses people off though.

2866
02:40:58,810 --> 02:41:03,280
I know. They're like, don't call it. We'd
say, well, okay, it's somebody. Yeah,

2867
02:41:03,460 --> 02:41:07,360
this should, yeah, it should be a better
account of what the fuck we stands for.

2868
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:10,930
Yeah. It's like I'm sick of just
saying like the US government. This,

2869
02:41:11,560 --> 02:41:14,380
that's the real problem with
like conspiracy theory type talk.

2870
02:41:14,470 --> 02:41:17,230
The government is trying to,
how much of the government,

2871
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:21,370
because the government itself, it's
the IRS, the CIA, the FBI and the NSA.

2872
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:24,400
A lot of them which don't even like
each other. Even though we have,

2873
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:28,200
it's not us necessarily doing it.
We are sponsoring it with our tax dollars,

2874
02:41:28,201 --> 02:41:31,380
so it really is. We in
a general sense. Sure.

2875
02:41:31,720 --> 02:41:33,250
In a very general surgery general,

2876
02:41:33,300 --> 02:41:36,490
we think of like responsibility for the
actual action itself and then we say,

2877
02:41:36,491 --> 02:41:38,790
we did this and Afghanistan,
we did this and that. Right.

2878
02:41:38,980 --> 02:41:41,590
I didn't fucking slaughter
any Afghanis or it's,

2879
02:41:42,060 --> 02:41:46,810
it gets real tricky when you get
into the weeds. Strange Times.

2880
02:41:46,980 --> 02:41:51,790
That'd be Martin to think about that
like your historically to be a reporter.

2881
02:41:52,060 --> 02:41:53,860
This is one of the weirdest times ever.

2882
02:41:54,130 --> 02:41:59,130
It's one of the weirdest times ever
to to be witnessing sort of a society

2883
02:41:59,230 --> 02:42:01,390
boiling. I guess though the, the,

2884
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:04,660
their statement holds true that every
time was the weirdest time for that time.

2885
02:42:04,680 --> 02:42:07,660
Right, right. But this is
the weirdest time ever.

2886
02:42:07,850 --> 02:42:09,350
Yeah. I, I think about that a lot.

2887
02:42:09,351 --> 02:42:12,290
I think because of the advancement of
technology and the fact that we are so

2888
02:42:12,291 --> 02:42:15,710
interconnected and know about all the
horrible shit going on at any given time,

2889
02:42:15,711 --> 02:42:19,250
does it just seem like it's so much poor
fucked up now because we have access to

2890
02:42:19,251 --> 02:42:21,940
all of that. We get like an AP newser
when everything horrible happened.

2891
02:42:21,941 --> 02:42:26,060
It's like, I don't know. Or is there
really more like horrible shit going on?

2892
02:42:26,090 --> 02:42:28,700
I don't know. Well, we definitely
have more if you hear that.

2893
02:42:28,701 --> 02:42:32,120
It's not me paying for corn, a little
coffee. I think we definitely have. Yeah,

2894
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:33,910
more access.
There's no question about that.

2895
02:42:33,911 --> 02:42:37,020
And so we're going to hear more stories
about things that have happened, but I,

2896
02:42:37,021 --> 02:42:39,030
I wish I knew how much of it's,

2897
02:42:39,080 --> 02:42:44,050
it's how much of it is actually how much
of it is affecting the actual things

2898
02:42:44,051 --> 02:42:44,300
that we,
we

2899
02:42:44,300 --> 02:42:45,530
do, I don't know about. Well,

2900
02:42:45,531 --> 02:42:47,690
that's the problem is all we
hear on the corporate media shit,

2901
02:42:47,691 --> 02:42:51,320
that doesn't affect us. Jodi
Arias, case, Zimmerman. I mean,

2902
02:42:51,321 --> 02:42:53,030
in the grand scheme of things,
you can argue that yes,

2903
02:42:53,031 --> 02:42:54,770
the stand your ground laws
definitely affect people.

2904
02:42:54,771 --> 02:42:58,910
But did it warrant that much coverage
for weeks and weeks and weeks and every

2905
02:42:58,911 --> 02:43:02,540
detail of the case. Now,
here's a perfect example today.

2906
02:43:02,541 --> 02:43:05,420
Think about all the shit that's
going on in the world today. I mean,

2907
02:43:05,450 --> 02:43:07,250
there's giant chunks.

2908
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:12,160
Manhattan size or falling off
a fucking Greenland, that huge

2909
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:14,470
chunks of ice, right?
We all know about that.

2910
02:43:14,590 --> 02:43:16,630
We all know about this
Bradley manning thing.

2911
02:43:16,631 --> 02:43:18,670
We all know about this
Edward Snowden thing.

2912
02:43:18,671 --> 02:43:21,520
We all know about what the
fuck is going on with Iran.

2913
02:43:21,670 --> 02:43:23,980
What's happening with North Korea.
We all know about that.

2914
02:43:23,981 --> 02:43:28,540
But the front page of CNN,
I'm fighting for my life.

2915
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:33,190
It's a ride because he's
suspended for a year.

2916
02:43:33,430 --> 02:43:37,930
You know what?
He only has $270 million.

2917
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:43,200
What will he do if he is forced to take
a heat a whole year off for using roads?

2918
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:48,250
Fucking bad for him to stop what you're
saying or what are you a communist?

2919
02:43:49,930 --> 02:43:51,820
This is front page news for a reason.

2920
02:43:51,821 --> 02:43:55,150
Cause this is the most important
story in America. A rod suspended,

2921
02:43:55,450 --> 02:43:59,980
but in lineup during appeal.
So he's allowed to go into
law so we can go, this is,

2922
02:43:59,981 --> 02:44:03,520
how is this going to play out? It's
going to kind of watch it. Grand drama

2923
02:44:04,010 --> 02:44:07,100
as fuck. You know what terrified
me is I vice is so awesome.

2924
02:44:07,101 --> 02:44:10,340
I love that you've been
interviewing as Shane Smith.
Yeah, he's, he's awesome dude.

2925
02:44:10,341 --> 02:44:15,310
This oh wow. Great column and taking
rides to um, whew. Wow. No. But the Fenix,

2926
02:44:15,440 --> 02:44:19,160
the Venice one where he was like,
Venice is underwater. Holy Shit.

2927
02:44:20,030 --> 02:44:22,340
Like underwater for a hundred
days out of the year. It's just,

2928
02:44:22,850 --> 02:44:24,770
that's how much the
oceans rising right now.

2929
02:44:24,771 --> 02:44:28,010
So it's like the people who
are much is accessible. Um,

2930
02:44:28,070 --> 02:44:30,080
they've just built bridges all over,

2931
02:44:30,081 --> 02:44:33,860
so people just walk on these
platforms all over the city. Wow.

2932
02:44:34,140 --> 02:44:37,430
A hundred days of the year, it's
totally flooded. So it is, is it rising?

2933
02:44:37,431 --> 02:44:41,210
Like how much of a difference is it from
before it's been progressively rising

2934
02:44:41,350 --> 02:44:42,950
and Shane Smith is just like,
look,

2935
02:44:42,951 --> 02:44:45,890
these people who are arguing
about is global warming,

2936
02:44:45,891 --> 02:44:49,610
manmade is climate change
payment. It doesn't fucking
matter. It's happening now.

2937
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:54,150
We don't need to have the argument
about fucking who did it. Yeah. Yeah.

2938
02:44:54,590 --> 02:44:57,830
Shit's fucked up and bullshit.
What do we do about it?

2939
02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:01,210
That's a quote somewhere in the
bottom of a message board now.

2940
02:45:01,430 --> 02:45:04,010
That'd be more him chips fucked up.
That's going to be in a bottle.

2941
02:45:04,040 --> 02:45:07,450
The cork bottle. A real good
point. There was an article

2942
02:45:07,750 --> 02:45:11,310
Miami, they were talking about Miami and
within the decade we'll be underwater.

2943
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:12,730
They're like,
you can't stop it.

2944
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:17,110
Also because Miami apparently is
on like I very porous limestone.

2945
02:45:17,170 --> 02:45:20,710
It's not hard ground cause it's like,
it's not just at sea level.

2946
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:23,920
It's like a giant sponge. Great. So they
were saying that like it's gonna be,

2947
02:45:23,950 --> 02:45:27,320
it's gonna be crazy. Like it's all
just going to be a marsh. Like you're,

2948
02:45:27,340 --> 02:45:28,330
you're not gonna be able to get here.

2949
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:32,010
Mondo. I think the problem with the whole
argument is people like Al Gore who are

2950
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:34,800
actually profiting off the solutions,
the carbon credit thing.

2951
02:45:34,801 --> 02:45:36,560
I think it's bullshit.
Um,

2952
02:45:36,630 --> 02:45:39,570
you can't trade pollution and somehow
think that's going to be fucking in the

2953
02:45:39,571 --> 02:45:42,610
answer. So I think, and then
when you see things like, uh,

2954
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:47,160
the meat industry not getting penalized
for the fact that they are creating the

2955
02:45:47,161 --> 02:45:50,470
majority of carbon output. So this
is a meat industry that's doing that.

2956
02:45:50,750 --> 02:45:53,690
The methane coming from far farther.
So,

2957
02:45:53,710 --> 02:45:56,880
so the methane from cow farts are the
biggest problem the world's ever known.

2958
02:45:58,830 --> 02:46:01,800
I think it's a large percentage of,
of carbon emissions.

2959
02:46:01,801 --> 02:46:05,220
But the fact that we're not even talking
about that, it's like the, you know,

2960
02:46:05,221 --> 02:46:08,580
the burdens put on the consumer
where we're like calculate
your carbon footprint.

2961
02:46:08,581 --> 02:46:09,740
I think people like what the fuck?

2962
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:13,940
Yeah. We need to put cups
over the back of cows. Bucks,

2963
02:46:14,450 --> 02:46:18,080
tape those bitches down and capture
all that methane. Just capture it.

2964
02:46:18,350 --> 02:46:18,980
You know what?

2965
02:46:18,980 --> 02:46:23,960
Put them in the Dome like that Stephen
King Book put all the cows inside of the

2966
02:46:23,961 --> 02:46:28,610
dome. Is that one of those cows? It
has a, um, is that we'll get the balls.

2967
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:32,480
Jesus Christ the size,
that fucking bull. Um,

2968
02:46:33,140 --> 02:46:35,330
they could capture it.
Why can't they capture it and you can,

2969
02:46:35,331 --> 02:46:38,390
they figure out a way to like dome
them cows in and suck all the mess.

2970
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:45,700
You could put a man in orbit
in the space station floating

2971
02:46:45,820 --> 02:46:48,990
above the planet and he could
fucking Twitter from up there.

2972
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:52,470
You tell me you can't dome up
a few cows and suck them farts.

2973
02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:55,950
Turn them in the resources.
Isn't that possible?

2974
02:46:55,980 --> 02:46:58,020
It seems like he's pretty positive.
It should be, right? Yeah.

2975
02:46:58,021 --> 02:46:59,610
If we can figure out to do satellites,

2976
02:46:59,611 --> 02:47:02,880
we should be able to figure out a suck
methane out of the air, out of cows,

2977
02:47:02,930 --> 02:47:07,410
asses the future gloomy or Rosie?
Abby Martin.

2978
02:47:07,730 --> 02:47:09,610
I think it depends on your

2979
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:11,310
perspective. I hate
people who are like, oh,

2980
02:47:11,311 --> 02:47:15,420
I don't look at positive or negative news
because I was pushing of your grandma.

2981
02:47:15,430 --> 02:47:20,030
I now look at news cause it
makes me sad. I don't have, oh,

2982
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:23,430
I'm just really positive. I just like
don't, oh no, that's just too negative.

2983
02:47:23,431 --> 02:47:26,240
It's like, well this is fucking reality.
So you're going to intake reality

2984
02:47:26,610 --> 02:47:30,240
and figure out how you're going to relay
your own message of what reality is

2985
02:47:30,241 --> 02:47:31,530
like.
That's fucking truth.

2986
02:47:31,890 --> 02:47:34,860
So if you're going to reject
a whole portion of the
world because you don't want

2987
02:47:34,861 --> 02:47:37,890
to fucking be negative, then I didn't
really answer your question. I think

2988
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:42,940
either way it does. It's your, you're just
sort of hedging your bets. Yeah. Yeah.

2989
02:47:43,330 --> 02:47:44,770
It can go either way. Right. Do you think,

2990
02:47:45,100 --> 02:47:48,160
do you have a responsibility being in a
position where people are listening to

2991
02:47:48,161 --> 02:47:49,960
you to talk about certain things?

2992
02:47:50,850 --> 02:47:52,460
Uh, I think, yeah,

2993
02:47:52,490 --> 02:47:55,430
I mean I think I have the resources and
natural does it mean I had compassion

2994
02:47:56,450 --> 02:47:56,840
for the law.

2995
02:47:56,840 --> 02:48:01,840
I started off as an anti war activist and
then it just went from there realizing

2996
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:04,130
all this shit was censored.
Why is it sensored?

2997
02:48:04,131 --> 02:48:06,770
And I'm getting into media and so I've
been passionate about this stuff for,

2998
02:48:07,730 --> 02:48:11,030
since I was 17, you know, out
in the streets doing activism.

2999
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:14,060
You were in the streets at 17.
What are you doing out there

3000
02:48:14,580 --> 02:48:17,490
fucking trying to lobby against
is not blowing you rock up

3001
02:48:17,790 --> 02:48:20,640
when you were 17. Yeah. Wow.
How many people listened?

3002
02:48:23,990 --> 02:48:27,000
They're like, bitch, come
on. You're fucking 17.

3003
02:48:28,410 --> 02:48:31,990
How many people listen to 17 year
olds? Yeah. So unfortunate and aspect.

3004
02:48:32,060 --> 02:48:32,271
Well,

3005
02:48:32,271 --> 02:48:34,880
what's crazy is that there was millions
of people in the street saying the same

3006
02:48:34,881 --> 02:48:35,760
thing,
but we were at Norton.

3007
02:48:36,590 --> 02:48:41,030
Um, when you see like a occupy
Wall Street and shit like that,

3008
02:48:41,060 --> 02:48:44,520
do you think that that has positive
effect? Absolutely. I think so. Yeah.

3009
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:46,590
I think that it really got the,
uh,

3010
02:48:47,580 --> 02:48:52,580
the debate into the 99% versus the 1%
kind of realizing that we all have so many

3011
02:48:52,891 --> 02:48:55,580
problems and when people
demonized occupy and saying,

3012
02:48:55,581 --> 02:48:58,860
oh you guys can't get a consolidated
message, what the fuck is this all about?

3013
02:48:58,861 --> 02:49:03,510
It's like, well there's fucking 99
problems and a bitch ain't one. But no,

3014
02:49:03,511 --> 02:49:06,140
I mean there seriously so
many problems facing I was,

3015
02:49:06,160 --> 02:49:10,800
it all stems the same system so I don't
blame the Movement for not galvanizing

3016
02:49:10,801 --> 02:49:12,990
behind one message.
The problem with occupies,

3017
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:18,000
it was so inclusive that would be like
homeless people would be doing open mics

3018
02:49:18,391 --> 02:49:19,224
and shit.

3019
02:49:19,970 --> 02:49:24,000
Mike check. So like it's like,
dude, you can't mark chart number.

3020
02:49:24,350 --> 02:49:25,840
Everyone's like Mike
check and you're like,

3021
02:49:30,070 --> 02:49:31,220
I need a sip.

3022
02:49:31,630 --> 02:49:35,020
Well there was a cultural aspect to
the whole occupy thing that got little

3023
02:49:35,021 --> 02:49:38,260
strange and that was that Mike check
thing that people would do that like in

3024
02:49:38,261 --> 02:49:42,460
courthouses, Mike checking in, people will
like yell it out. It was very military.

3025
02:49:42,650 --> 02:49:46,700
I think there needs to be some sort of
leadership, you know? But then again,

3026
02:49:46,701 --> 02:49:51,140
I think that there needs to be, if we
had like a true democracy would be, uh,

3027
02:49:51,500 --> 02:49:56,500
and I think if we had people
actually having democratic input,

3028
02:49:56,540 --> 02:49:57,920
but the thing is we don't have that.

3029
02:49:57,921 --> 02:50:01,610
We have like what one delegate that can
go and fucking the electoral college is

3030
02:50:01,611 --> 02:50:04,790
bullshit. We don't even have like
direct representation. So it's just,

3031
02:50:05,090 --> 02:50:08,600
it was a good concept and I think
it's the start of it, you know,

3032
02:50:08,601 --> 02:50:12,380
it was cracked down brutally
by militarized riot police
all across the country

3033
02:50:12,381 --> 02:50:14,950
on a federal level.
I saw it firsthand.

3034
02:50:14,990 --> 02:50:18,380
I was in Oakland living there and
there's a fucking police state dude.

3035
02:50:18,381 --> 02:50:18,681
I was like,

3036
02:50:18,681 --> 02:50:23,681
why are you guys expelling so many
resources to shut down at a little camp of

3037
02:50:24,081 --> 02:50:28,610
like a hundred people? It was like fucking
a thousand police full riot riot gear.

3038
02:50:29,150 --> 02:50:32,420
I like treating it like a riot.
Like I don't understand if you have,

3039
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:36,050
if you're dressed as a paramilitary troop,
um,

3040
02:50:36,530 --> 02:50:40,840
I don't understand why you need to be,
uh, using these crowd control methods if,

3041
02:50:40,870 --> 02:50:43,280
if there's no right. It's like,
I don't know. It's just bizarre.

3042
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:47,210
Fart in the new generation. It's part
of what it always is going to be.

3043
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:51,380
There's always going to be a resisting
of change and try and fight back.

3044
02:50:51,470 --> 02:50:54,160
The angry hoards.
I mean this is very similar to

3045
02:50:54,210 --> 02:50:57,660
dress like a troop. You're going
to act like a fucking soldier.

3046
02:50:57,860 --> 02:51:00,090
You know what?
I have described it as like an enemy.

3047
02:51:00,180 --> 02:51:04,560
I've described operation or occupy Wall
Street as being sort of like white blood

3048
02:51:04,561 --> 02:51:07,080
cells like there,
they're going around the infected area.

3049
02:51:07,110 --> 02:51:09,160
They don't know what the fuck
they're going to do, what they're,

3050
02:51:09,161 --> 02:51:12,300
they're making it inflamed.
They're causing attention.

3051
02:51:12,301 --> 02:51:14,690
Like when you get an infection on your
knee and you look down at your knees

3052
02:51:14,691 --> 02:51:18,510
swollen, that's sort of like white
blood cells and occupy Wall Street.

3053
02:51:18,690 --> 02:51:20,220
He looked down and this,

3054
02:51:20,221 --> 02:51:23,340
these areas where these people camped
out and screaming and yelling and doing

3055
02:51:23,341 --> 02:51:26,150
mic checks all day and like that's
inflammation. You've got an,

3056
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:28,050
you got an inflammation spot,
you've got a sore,

3057
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:29,280
you got a dirty little store right there.

3058
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:35,440
It's, it's for there for a
reason. So future. Rosie,

3059
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:39,130
can we say Rosie? Yeah. Possibly. Possibly
Rosie get worse before it gets better.

3060
02:51:39,131 --> 02:51:42,850
But I have faith in humanity and I think
that we can pull things around and I

3061
02:51:42,851 --> 02:51:45,010
wouldn't be doing what I'm
doing if I didn't believe that.

3062
02:51:45,340 --> 02:51:47,650
Do you like working for our tea?
I do.

3063
02:51:47,651 --> 02:51:50,470
I have an amazing amount
of editorial control over.

3064
02:51:50,471 --> 02:51:52,540
What do you say that you
like working for Russia?

3065
02:51:54,610 --> 02:51:59,230
It's a pretty fucked up world, isn't it?
Yeah. Yeah. It just, it's just twisted.

3066
02:51:59,231 --> 02:52:02,980
It's like I never thought that I'd just
right and right is left to tell the

3067
02:52:02,981 --> 02:52:06,550
truth. That's crazy
powerful. Poff Abby Martin,

3068
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:10,070
so he could follow Abby Martin on
Twitter. It's just Abby Martin, right?

3069
02:52:10,100 --> 02:52:12,890
Harvey Martin. And um, is
there a website for your show?

3070
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:17,400
Oh, just look at breaking the set on
youtube and I also have media roots is my

3071
02:52:17,401 --> 02:52:20,760
immediate organization on the side. Abby
Martin. Dot Org. Anything else to say?

3072
02:52:20,761 --> 02:52:25,590
Like five people before you bolt?
Yeah, just fucking the truth is,

3073
02:52:25,650 --> 02:52:27,360
is enlightening.
Don't reject it.

3074
02:52:27,780 --> 02:52:31,680
Embrace it and express yourself.
And if you're passionate about something,

3075
02:52:31,681 --> 02:52:35,010
it's a responsibility to express
that in whatever medium you choose.

3076
02:52:35,011 --> 02:52:38,550
But don't reject the truth and don't
turn it off because we got to fucking

3077
02:52:38,940 --> 02:52:39,773
progress.

3078
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:41,780
In other words,
get it together.

3079
02:52:41,781 --> 02:52:46,310
Bitches with much love for all who
spread the love and you shall receive.

3083

3093
02:53:38,241 --> 02:53:41,360

this Wednesday we explore that option.

3094

We're talking to Ray Kurzweil.
