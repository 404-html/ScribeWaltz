1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,210
Boom,
we're live shutting a laptop.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,620
I don't need that.
You've got a flip phone.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,420
I had a flip phone.
I don't need a fucking lap.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,040
No,
no electronics today.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,920
I got a flip phone.
What a simple guy.

6
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:11,940
You know what I mean?
A long time.

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,530
What do I need?
I take.

8
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:18,531
I get texts and make a call.
Do you do like at least give you a full 

9
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:23,240
keyboard for text?
Are you doing so?

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,650
That way if you text me,
I'll give you an answer,

11
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,740
but it's going to take a awhile and just
give you a quick gauge.

12
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:30,660
I can't have a conversation like people 
don't.

13
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,340
Some people get ridiculous,
although you up to what do I.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,560
What am I up to?
Exactly what you want to talk like a 12 

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:38,560
year old girl.
Call me,

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,930
man.
What are we doing?

17
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,720
I mean,
I'm not a teenager.

18
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,780
Call me.
You want me to talk?

19
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:44,190
That's what I'm saying.
Shit.

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,380
Good to see you,
brother.

21
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,510
It's been a long time.
It's been a long time.

22
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:51,030
Really locked in on you for a long 
fucking time.

23
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:51,690
Dude.
It's.

24
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,110
It's interesting to see a friend who was
in,

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,140
I mean you were always in show business 
because you ran the Riviera,

26
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,380
but to go from that to being on the 
soprano's I remember hearing about it 

27
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,800
and then seeing it and the sopranos was 
my favorite show at the time.

28
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,280
I read it to you I think in little Italy
way back when,

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,320
when I was living down there,
so it had to be early 2000 like that 

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,950
99,000.
I just couldn't believe it.

31
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,951
It was just,
it was so weird watching a guy like you 

32
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:26,630
all of a sudden was just a friend.
All of a sudden you're on my favorite 

33
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,291
show is,
it's a strange thing to watch someone 

34
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,050
who you like who's on a show playing 
somebody else.

35
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,820
No,
you know what the thing is,

36
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:34,070
I can't even say like,
you know,

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,130
Joe,
like I couldn't even say,

38
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:38,640
well you don't lose your dream man.
I always wanted to do it because I never

39
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,330
wanted to,
you know,

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,120
I was like screwing around,
you know,

41
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:47,121
and uh,
I think pollock put me in one of his 

42
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:49,140
things and Bruce Baum and you know,
I was running the club,

43
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,910
used to work the club,
right?

44
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:55,911
The extreme comedy get bummed out.
When I heard they were tearing down the 

45
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:55,911
Riviera.
A lot of people,

46
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:58,450
a lot of people really got sad.
I wish I could have went back because it

47
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,820
was,
it was at one time.

48
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:00,990
It was good.
It was really good.

49
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,430
Was it gone now?
Is it go?

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,440
They're not going to done.
I think they should talk to Schumer 

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,440
taught,
shown,

52
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,441
you know,
knocking the thing that I saw dice in 

53
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,690
the upstairs room like a year and a half
ago or so.

54
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,560
I went down there and he was doing,
they started doing shows up there,

55
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:21,000
the Amy Schumer and they did dice and 
Gilbert and a bunch of people in that.

56
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,150
They used to be the female impersonators
ship.

57
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,200
Yes.
Yeah.

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,010
That guy's still around,
but we just keep on going,

59
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,730
keep pictures of them.
They should be arrested for fraud,

60
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,870
for fucking picture they use in.
The guy's got to be in the seventies and

61
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:40,710
I know he's 85 years old.
He's at least 100.

62
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:43,190
He's got a house.
He's got a house like A.

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,600
I had a film something at his house once
and it's like a mini liberace.

64
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,290
Like that kind of thing.
You just what you think it is?

65
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,650
Yeah,
that's what it is.

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,660
I'm sure you know.
He also would be crazy,

67
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:59,070
like he had a housekeeper and he would 
like to leave things around on purpose,

68
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,800
see if they were clean.
And you know that one of those guys,

69
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,380
he's still gone.
I think he's at the,

70
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,660
I don't know the imperial.
What's one is one of those strange 

71
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,660
casino.
He's one of those,

72
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,640
but they still gone and then there's the
guy still playing.

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,530
The guy that does Tina Turner is older 
than 10 to 10.

74
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,460
Well,
I remember watching that show once that 

75
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:23,800
show I watched once and crazy girl I 
watched.

76
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,450
There was comics used to come in and out
of their staff over the years.

77
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,380
I remember years ago they needed a 
filling.

78
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:36,400
I put sinbad and they're real crazy 
girls because it was upstairs,

79
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:41,401
you know,
the show's been around for years and 

80
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:41,401
they all ran simultaneously,
which the three,

81
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,920
you know,
hey,

82
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,730
we had the comedy club,
he had a cottage crazy girls.

83
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,470
So it was all,
you know.

84
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,340
Yeah,
no,

85
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,500
I remember it was,
it was,

86
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:54,501
uh,
it was the first place I ever worked in 

87
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:54,501
Vegas.
Yeah,

88
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:54,501
yeah,
yeah.

89
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,730
We,
I did that extreme comedy xxx right.

90
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:57,670
He came in for the weekend,
which was great.

91
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,770
Puts you in the suite,
do the thing.

92
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,000
I took a photo of my name on the marquee
because I was like,

93
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:03,580
look at that.

94
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,580
It's my name's.
I had one of those cameras that you're 

95
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,920
buying.
It looked a lot at a lot of stuff.

96
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,880
I started at 1986.
Whoa.

97
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,070
You know,
way back when it was still like,

98
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,940
you know,
one of the Ta,

99
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,520
you know,
still a good hotel.

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,450
I mean,
my brother,

101
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,360
that's what you're trying to say,
that that Kinda was gone.

102
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:28,470
But then you had rick who was kinda 
different,

103
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,620
kinda mobster,
you know,

104
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,050
he was in Israel,
he started the junk bonds.

105
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,210
He who is he?
He was married to Peter the door.

106
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,220
He owned it when I was there.
So they just found a different way to 

107
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,220
skim the money,
you know,

108
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,630
through construction or whatever.
They weren't bag man.

109
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,540
It was just a different,
different deals.

110
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,370
Like the air conditioners he bought for 
the new building,

111
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,330
they were from Israel,
like they didn't have parts in the 

112
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:54,330
United States.

113
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,990
So like all the,
you know what I'm saying?

114
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,360
It was there.
They found different ways,

115
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,800
but he was good to me.
You know,

116
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,730
he was good to me.
Rick,

117
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,500
he owned the hotel when I first got 
there in [inaudible] 86 and Sinatra was,

118
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,120
you know,
played there in [inaudible] 88,

119
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:09,790
89,
90 Sinatra was there.

120
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,910
You still had a license and playing 
there.

121
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:16,450
You had a Milton Berle,
Sid Caesar,

122
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,380
they,
I mean it was still playing,

123
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,660
you know.
Wow.

124
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,290
Yeah,
yeah.

125
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,020
There was a lot of stuff came to us.
He got to see all those people.

126
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,970
They saw Sinatra night after night after
night and I just,

127
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,530
after I was done work,
I'll go sit in the back of the room,

128
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,360
you know,
sometimes my wife would come,

129
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,160
you know.
Wow.

130
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,130
And it was,
you know,

131
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,990
it was like no big deal after a while,
you know,

132
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:38,050
it's crazy.
I got a tape of him.

133
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,520
I got a tape of him on New Year's Eve,
I think it's New Year's Eve.

134
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,050
[inaudible] 89 or 90 to guys to the 
soundman took it.

135
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:52,051
It was close circuit.
Remember the closed circuit in the room 

136
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:52,930
and they're just in the room and they 
put a vhs,

137
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,200
vhs and Beta Max or whatever the hell it
was.

138
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,760
And uh,
he's drunk.

139
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,190
His toupees kind of crooked.
And Joey Remember Joey Villa?

140
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,260
He was a comic,
like a real,

141
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,830
you know,
real hacky,

142
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,580
thethey guy.
He was in splash that show.

143
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,650
Okay.
So you had joey villa opened the door 

144
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,210
and then driessen open for a Tom Dreesen

145
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,680
upstairs and downstairs he was drunk on 
his ass and archer.

146
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,170
And I have a tape of it somewhere.
I still have it somewhere and he played.

147
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,970
He says,
I don't care.

148
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,890
I play upstairs.
I played downstairs.

149
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,960
If they pay me,
I sing in a phone booth.

150
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,790
He didn't care at that point.
Wow.

151
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,330
How old was he back then?
I don't know.

152
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,600
He just turned 100.
It was like 1990.

153
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,820
So that was probably the beginning of 
the end.

154
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,430
Right before he started losing a little.
He had a teleprompter onstage,

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
you know,
he was reading though,

156
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,050
you know,
he wasn't completely out of it,

157
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:53,180
but you know,
I think he died in [inaudible] 99 if I'm

158
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:54,390
not mistaken.
So,

159
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:55,880
uh,
he would forget his lyrics.

160
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,810
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

161
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,800
Oh Wow.
Yeah,

162
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,570
absolutely.
Because it was so hammered.

163
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:00,770
There was just no,
no,

164
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:03,170
I just think he was getting older and I 
think to be honest,

165
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,420
my opinion that kept them out there too 
long,

166
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,410
you know,
I think whoever the powers may be,

167
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:14,411
I don't know who that was.
I think he stayed a little too long 

168
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:14,411
there,
you know,

169
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:15,560
but I hate to see him.
I saw him in [inaudible] 82 when I first

170
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,370
got to town and 80,
I saw him 1981,

171
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,480
82 83 in those days and she's just.

172
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,360
I mean,
that was something I saw Sammy Davis,

173
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,620
you know.
Wow.

174
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,240
Yeah,
I saw all those,

175
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:31,241
you know,
Johnny Martin told those guys that were 

176
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:33,131
there.
I saw a lot of stuff that people were 

177
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:33,131
gone,
you know?

178
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,870
Yeah.
You like caught the bridge for the last 

179
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:35,870
of the exact.
Absolutely.

180
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,830
When I moved in it was 350,000
people when I was friendly with the 

181
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,310
casino,
the Joe Pesci character,

182
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,680
Tony Spilotro,
his character.

183
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,540
I was friendly with that guy.
I was a bouncer.

184
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,960
He would come in the club all the time,
go the club.

185
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:53,030
He always give me a 20,
you know,

186
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,890
Kevin,
he was giving me $20 for years.

187
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,060
If I was a bartender to send up a 20.
He was always a good guy to me.

188
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,460
Now I don't know what he did,
but he didn't do.

189
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,170
He was good to me.
I didn't know the,

190
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:06,560
the uh,
I didn't know that Deniro character him.

191
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,390
I never knew he was around,
but I didn't know him,

192
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:10,770
but the Pegi character,
uh,

193
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,960
Tony splotch show and he had a guy,
fat Herbie and I was there.

194
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,690
His son got married.
I was the bouncer at the wedding to make

195
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:22,220
sure FBI didn't get into the,
into the wedding sweater guy.

196
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,300
They had a volunteer at the wedding,
bounces Tuxedo.

197
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,630
I was about to do it and make sure 
nobody that's not on that list doesn't 

198
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,360
come in,
but they're worried about the FBI at the

199
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:37,361
wedding.
They were worried because at the time 

200
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:37,361
there was,
you know,

201
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:37,510
it was a small town.
It was easy.

202
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:38,030
I mean,
you know,

203
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:39,530
they were doing whatever they were 
doing.

204
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,470
I mean,
I don't know,

205
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,120
you know,
I mean,

206
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,760
I was never privy to any of that,
but they were around.

207
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,910
How close was he to the character that 
she played?

208
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,210
You know,
I didn't see the nastiness he'd,

209
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,000
she caught the,
the voice and the accent.

210
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,560
He has that,
the Chicago.

211
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,620
And uh,
I only saw him being like a gentleman,

212
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,670
you know,
to be honest.

213
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,770
He had kids and I mean,
that's all I saw.

214
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:02,520
He was,
you know,

215
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,170
you have some drinks.
He's in the club,

216
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,630
but I didn't do anything crazy.
Well,

217
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,700
they always exaggerate things for shows 
and movies.

218
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,900
I of course.
I mean,

219
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,910
I would assume,
I don't know where they got it from,

220
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,030
but yeah,
I mean,

221
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:13,470
uh,
you know,

222
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,900
he was around,
he was kind of the Bosch in town,

223
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,850
you know,
in the movie he got beat to death with a

224
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:18,930
baseball bat.
Is that what happened?

225
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,910
Yeah.
And I think that did happen I think in a

226
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,730
cornfield.
Him and his brother back in Chicago.

227
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,010
Yeah.
But you know,

228
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:27,060
there was a small town.

229
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,030
Everybody knew everybody was two clubs,
no clubs,

230
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,910
no clubs at all in the casinos.
That was,

231
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,970
there was no nightclubs really know.
My coach that started in the nineties I 

232
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,560
think at the real was no night clubs 
that had two clubs in town.

233
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:43,740
Paul anchor on one and then there was 
another one,

234
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:48,741
like I would go to work at one in the 
morning to nine in the morning and I 

235
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:50,700
would leave and the dance floor was 
packed at 9:00,

236
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:51,300
9:00
AM.

237
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,420
Wow.
And then people would go out from there 

238
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:56,420
was just a completely different thing,
you know,

239
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,520
and all the entertainers would come out,
you know,

240
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:04,521
like,
I mean I saw Oj and cosby was out all 

241
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,120
the time and rich little and it was ever
was bob hope,

242
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,810
Bob Hope came into to club.
He left the uh,

243
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,360
the,
the bathroom attended thirty cents,

244
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,420
30,
30.

245
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,440
Got a quarter.

246
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,060
And,
and Nicole,

247
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,770
that's hilarious that you remember that 
though.

248
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,310
Yeah.
Well,

249
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,420
yeah,
there's certain things.

250
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,960
I remember the name Copperfield gave me 
$2.

251
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:25,620
He said,
hey,

252
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,310
if there's any girls,
bring them over to that sweaty,

253
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,920
sweaty my hand to God,
my $2.

254
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,640
And uh,
he,

255
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,300
he wasn't,
you know,

256
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:36,960
he was headlining but not that famous 
yet.

257
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:38,970
But give me like two bucks,
three bucks.

258
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,340
He said,
hey,

259
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,140
you know,
any girls,

260
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,480
girls and bring them this way.
And it me time.

261
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,190
I had guys giving me hundreds.
You know,

262
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,040
it's all dope deal is,
you know,

263
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,050
back then it was all crazy.
Kenneth did cost me have the reputation 

264
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,921
back then.
He didn't have a reputation of doing 

265
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,040
anything to the girls,
but always chasing girls.

266
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,470
Always,
always,

267
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,170
always,
always.

268
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,720
But he didn't have the reputation of 
drugs.

269
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,420
No,
no,

270
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,070
I didn't know anything about any of 
that.

271
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,300
I also knew that,
uh,

272
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,000
there was a time he didn't tip,
you know,

273
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,690
there's a lot of these guys don't want 
to,

274
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,230
you know,
Scotty pippin's famous,

275
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:12,960
no tip in pippin.
That was his nickname and I heard that,

276
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,300
you know,
holding Michael Jordan,

277
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,800
you know,
and the worst of all is tiger woods.

278
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,280
He's the absolute worst Tipa.
And you could ask anyone that's.

279
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,400
There was a girl that I knew,
she managed the restaurant and she was 

280
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,340
friendly with them and they would go 
out,

281
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,780
you know,
not just turned him,

282
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:34,980
you know,
like a group or whatever.

283
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,130
She said I couldn't afford to go out 
with him anymore because I was leaving 

284
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,100
tips because he would,
you know,

285
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,850
obviously it's costing me three,
$400 just from cleaning up his mess.

286
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,500
Luck.
Oh my God.

287
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,000
Why is that guy do that?
I don't understand how a guy,

288
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,230
because I don't want us to not rich 
because I think sometimes joe,

289
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:57,231
I think guys,
it's a privilege for you to have me in 

290
00:11:57,231 --> 00:11:57,231
your place.

291
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,390
I think it gets to that point.
That's what it should have been raising.

292
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,390
You know,
I listen,

293
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:04,480
when I started making more money,
I started taking better care of people.

294
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:05,850
I mean,
I was of course in Tampa,

295
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,450
but come on man,
you know,

296
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:08,830
you're,
you're lucky enough to,

297
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,570
you know,
you've done well.

298
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,010
Knock on wood,
I've done well.

299
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,610
I mean with the help,
pay it forward a little bit.

300
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,150
You don't feel it.
That's the thing.

301
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,210
Of course not.
If I lose 100 bucks at a dinner that 

302
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,080
night,
they go home and they,

303
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,620
Joe Rogan,
you know,

304
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,680
he gave me.
He took good care of me.

305
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:31,681
You may disguise night.
This guy's probably got two kids or 

306
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:31,681
whatever.
You know what I mean?

307
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:35,430
You know what I like to do,
like to do it and get the fuck out of 

308
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,430
there before they realize it.
I call it like leave it a love bomb.

309
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,910
I agree with bomb.
Get out of the room.

310
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,010
I agree with you,
you know,

311
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:38,820
you gotTa,
you know,

312
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,150
I mean,
uh,

313
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,300
you know,
some people I think,

314
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,490
and it happens a lot,
you hear it all the time.

315
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,430
A lot of athletes especially,
you know.

316
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Yeah.
Well is the ego that's involved with 

317
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,400
being an athlete sometimes.
Like I'm the man,

318
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,720
I can't be stopped.
Um,

319
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:57,550
you know,
fuck everybody else agree with that.

320
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:59,110
It sort of breeds it.
But there's female,

321
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,120
like if you go like dealers in vegas,
especially because everybody comes 

322
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,230
through there.
There's like,

323
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,270
I think it was athletic when he was 
dating j Lo might party was a crap deal.

324
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,960
And uh,
he left them five grand and she picked 

325
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:15,960
up 45,
you know,

326
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,670
in chips and she picked it all up a 500 
and left 500.

327
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,010
He left the 5,000
tip.

328
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,340
She picked it up and like,
absolutely what she stole.

329
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,430
She's a fucking thief.
Knew she did it,

330
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:33,230
but she wasn't leaving that much.
Fuck.

331
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,650
But you know,
you see it all the time.

332
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,940
All the time.
Tell you though,

333
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,360
I remember guys that took me years ago 
like way back when Tony Danza who I'm 

334
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:47,611
friends with,
I gave him $20 less like in 1981.

335
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:51,040
He gave me a 20.
That's like a big part of like the whole

336
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,670
culture of Vegas is typically always has
been.

337
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,610
And the thing is if you want to get 
treated right,

338
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,830
you need to tip.
Yeah,

339
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,400
that's it.
It doesn't,

340
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,750
it doesn't even take that much.
Guys don't understand that.

341
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:07,390
Waiting online for three hours at the 
buffet.

342
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:09,760
I mean why don't you just give the guy 
$20,

343
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:14,761
$10 and you get in the line.
Right now I understand is a guy like 

344
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:18,421
tiger woods,
like he's not going to feel $100 to 100 

345
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,950
bucks that that won't,
but that's a character flaw,

346
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:21,250
man.

347
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,980
That's a character flaw that you just 
don't want to share.

348
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,830
I mean that's.
You don't.

349
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,390
They don't deserve it.
Yeah.

350
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,630
That's what,
that's just so crazy to me.

351
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,300
I just don't understand it.
Plus if I want to get treated good,

352
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:36,301
it doesn't matter who you are.
You could be a plumber from encino and 

353
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:38,200
throw a few bucks around and you're 
going to get treated like a king for,

354
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,880
you know,
what's it take?

355
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,320
Well,
that's what that whole town is about.

356
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:46,530
At least it wasn't when it was built on.
They kind of took that away because a 

357
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,031
lot of people,
and it started with Steve when a lot of 

358
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:51,980
people.
He was a big one.

359
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:57,030
He did.
He thought they would make it too much 

360
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,030
money.
The deal is the waitresses,

361
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,080
the captains in the show room.
I got a 90 year old friend,

362
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,840
was the captain in the showroom during 
Elvis at the Hilton.

363
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,500
He was making $800 a night cash in the 
seventies.

364
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,240
A lot of money.
That's probably like 8,000

365
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:14,310
in Vegas at the time.
Your cost,

366
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,540
it still doesn't cost a much to live in 
Vegas.

367
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:22,541
But then of course nothing.
So these guys were buying land and they 

368
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,990
were invested in and,
and,

369
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:28,991
and going out at night and it was 
trickling down really well when stopped 

370
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,650
all that.
So he's the first guy to do the numbered

371
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:31,620
seeding.
What did he.

372
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,080
I don't understand what he did the 
summer.

373
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:35,150
He got rid of all those captains,
maitre d's,

374
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,290
waitresses,
you know,

375
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,480
he days.
Well,

376
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,830
he got there.
They no longer.

377
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,600
When you have a show in Vegas,
do you have a number ticket to get in?

378
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,340
Right.
Those people know where they're going.

379
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,490
It didn't used to be that way.
You used to buy,

380
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,340
you know you're going to go in and then 
you tip the Maitre d,

381
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,480
$20,
$30,

382
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:55,010
$40,
and you get a good seat.

383
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,760
That's what Vegas was built on for years
and years and years.

384
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,610
He stopped all that same thing with a 
dealer.

385
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,210
He didn't want them to make as much,
so they put it on the check.

386
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:08,660
Now they all pull no matter whether you 
work hard enough,

387
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,720
so when you go into a game,
when you go to a blackjack game and you 

388
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,870
got to deal with that's a prick and you 
saw this bitch,

389
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:17,310
I'm not going to give her anything.
You don't tip.

390
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,990
And then there's a nice guy and you say,
you know what?

391
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,890
He's a lot of fun.
I'm going to give him $100.

392
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:22,970
Well,
at the end of the night,

393
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:26,480
that all goes into a big pool.
Twenty four hours a day.

394
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,020
Every deal splits them up.
That sounds ridiculous,

395
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,230
is ridiculous.
So some guys are slack is and they go,

396
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,860
hey man,
I ain't got out of this is going to go 

397
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:38,860
be a mechanic,
you know,

398
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:38,860
just going to be a robot and do what I 
do.

399
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,140
And no personality and flair.
It's exactly what.

400
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,110
That's so crazy.
Yeah.

401
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,240
So that whole Steve Wynn decided to do 
that because I think he thought people 

402
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,410
tip and big make it too much money.
Money that could have been instead of 

403
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:54,830
tip and he'll make the money,
you know,

404
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:58,730
instead of me giving the Maitre d $100 
for a good seat,

405
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,390
I'm just going to charge them $100 for c
and I'm going to get the money.

406
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,590
That's how it is.
Now,

407
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,480
you know,
expensive tickets are in Vegas.

408
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,800
Oh,
that's awful.

409
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,250
Got Comedy Club in Vegas.
Costs like $60 a song.

410
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,130
I really like the Brad Garrett.
Yeah,

411
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,630
I think it's like $60.
That's a nice little club.

412
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,170
Yeah.
And it's,

413
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,070
it's done well.
It's him and uh,

414
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,050
the left factory now are the big ones to
Riv went away.

415
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,300
The improv I just read is going away in 
May.

416
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,830
They've been there a long time.

417
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:25,510
The,
uh,

418
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,070
the laugh factory dice is doing a 
residency.

419
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,710
Oh,
he,

420
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,920
yeah,
he's doing like a temporary residency.

421
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,350
It's kind of like blocked off some dates
do well.

422
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,470
Who was doing?
Yeah,

423
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,590
he'll do well.
Well,

424
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:38,960
he's got that new showtime show now.
He had called me.

425
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:42,810
He wanted me to read for a role there,
which I really love because he's,

426
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,320
I think he's funny and he's good.
He would have been great on that.

427
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,800
He's a good actor.
He's always thought he was a really good

428
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,650
active way back from crime story.
I do remember that.

429
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,140
Do you.
Did you ever see that Woody Allen movie?

430
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,970
Blue Jasmine?
Absolutely was excellent in that movie.

431
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,360
It was really good actor.
He's good guy.

432
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,050
He's done the other stuff too,
you know,

433
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:02,530
before that,
you know,

434
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:03,660
I mean,
it just finally,

435
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,670
after all the other stuff,
they,

436
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,390
they recognized that and I think he 
shows funny.

437
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,590
It is funny.
Well,

438
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,090
at that.
And so it was Natasha,

439
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,120
his wife on the show.
She's fucking Kevin Crogan the other 

440
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,460
night in New York.
Kevin the plays a side kicked in.

441
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

442
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:20,720
I saw him the other night.
I ran into him.

443
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,840
What?
Dice took a lot of shit for a long time 

444
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:25,840
and now it's finally coming around.
It's cool to like dice again.

445
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,920
You know why it went so bad in the first
place I don't solve it was MTV and 

446
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:35,790
political correctness and it was just a 
different time back then.

447
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,040
Like they were trying to get away with 
that.

448
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,730
They're trying to move away from that 
kind of humor that he was doing.

449
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,170
Yeah.
But the thing is,

450
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,850
which you know,
like you're a comedian who's to say,

451
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:50,370
who could say what onstage and what's 
funny.

452
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,300
Exactly.
Funny.

453
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:55,080
And we could go round and round and I 
can't make a joke about this.

454
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,280
Well,
that's what the whole thing's about.

455
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Do you know a guy like Buddy Hackett and
those old comics that you should do 

456
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,470
Polish jokes and a Chinese jokes and 
Japanese jokes?

457
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,270
They couldn't even work now.
No.

458
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,050
That's out of the picture.
You know,

459
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,070
you know those guys,
you should do the accents and all that 

460
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,070
nonsense and uh,
you know,

461
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,220
you know,
you can still make fun of white people 

462
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220
if you're a black guy can make fun of 
white people.

463
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,560
That's,
that's totally acceptable and you can't,

464
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,140
you can't make fun of black people.
No,

465
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,500
no,
no,

466
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:22,950
no,
no.

467
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,860
Even light skinned.
Black people have a hard time making fun

468
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:27,300
of black people.
GotTa very careful.

469
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,650
Yeah.
Uh,

470
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,160
I,
I don't get all that,

471
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:36,720
but that swung so far joe sometimes that
I'm not a political guy.

472
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:39,450
I think that it's so broken in the 
country.

473
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:40,980
It can't be fixed.
Well,

474
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:45,981
you know,
what it is I think is more people have 

475
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:47,871
opinions now.
More people can express their opinions 

476
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:47,871
now.
It's just a different world.

477
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:51,320
Whereas there's so much coming at you 
from so many different angles and then 

478
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,310
people realize they can express their 
opinions.

479
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,400
So many people realize that if they say 
something on facebook,

480
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,710
it'll get a bunch of likes.
Or if they say something on twitter,

481
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,590
but it's easy to do that stuff 
anonymous.

482
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,900
A lot of people don't want to.
They don't want to though,

483
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,520
a lot of people don't want to do it 
anonymous,

484
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,490
but they all do it or not.
There's that two people that could just,

485
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,020
you know,
motherfucker you from now until forever 

486
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,020
and you don't even know who the guy is.

487
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,080
That's true.
But when they see it,

488
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,480
they still know they did it.
So that's why they're doing it.

489
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,510
They're doing it to get attention.
Even if the attention doesn't directly 

490
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,510
come to them in,
you know,

491
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,130
as Steve [inaudible] name,
it doesn't come at their name.

492
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,100
It's still,
they know that fuck face 69,

493
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:30,720
the twitter profile.
They know,

494
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,080
they make that and so when they're 
saying something nasty about you,

495
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,160
they know that they're the one that 
wrote it and he responded and tell their

496
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:38,890
friends.
You know,

497
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,400
it's just people.
People just,

498
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,960
it's,
it's a new thing.

499
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,030
It's a new thing to be able to reach out
to people.

500
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,160
It's a new thing to be able to protest,
to comment

501
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,890
on people and to be able to organize 
things like very easily.

502
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,560
Like if a comedian,
like,

503
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,070
um,
any comedian,

504
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,100
you know,
if they say something that someone 

505
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,590
thinks is crosses along,
they can organize a boycott.

506
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,050
They want to get them kicked off a 
television show.

507
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,700
I mean,
it happens over and over and over.

508
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,590
They're keeping these guys from working.
Yeah,

509
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,600
keeping these guys from working for 
what?

510
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,750
Well,
because they're just constantly of 

511
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:12,750
chilling the,
the,

512
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,811
the announcer for espn,
they just get fired because he doesn't 

513
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:17,660
believe the transgender bathroom thing.
Was that what he got fired?

514
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,840
They got fired for that and he kept 
talking about,

515
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,350
well,
you know what?

516
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:25,351
He had a picture that he put on twitter 
that showed a guy in a dress with his 

517
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:28,240
tits hanging out that said,
under this new law,

518
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:30,320
this guy could share a bathroom with 
your daughter.

519
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,280
Yeah.
So your to get fired for that.

520
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,850
Well,
here's the deal,

521
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,350
here's the deal.
Um,

522
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,310
that is possible.
And in,

523
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,590
in someone not admitting that that 
doesn't help anybody.

524
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,700
I mean,
it just doesn't,

525
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,690
it doesn't help.
It doesn't help.

526
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:47,770
But goddamn thing that,
that is possible.

527
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,400
Like you could get a fucking nut bag who
wears a dress and what's a whip his cock

528
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:55,900
out in front of women and says there's a
woman that that is a real thing.

529
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,780
Like I'm not saying that it should.
Yeah,

530
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,300
I mean I'm not saying that that's the 
majority,

531
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:04,900
but we got to define what's a woman and 
what's not a woman.

532
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:10,310
If you're going to allow transgender 
people to transition and become a the 

533
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,230
other gender,
whether it's woman to Male,

534
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:13,150
male to female,
you gotta,

535
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,870
we gotta make some sort of a standard 
where we know that that's exactly what's

536
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:17,830
going on in this.

537
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,460
Not just someone who's a crazy fuck 
wants to wear a dress,

538
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,460
but how do you do that?
That's a great question.

539
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:24,550
How do you do that?
Well,

540
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:29,551
that's why the idea of making people go 
to a bathroom that is their gender,

541
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,010
what they're born with,
like their sex,

542
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,080
what's their chromosomes?
It's not preposterous and everybody's 

543
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,371
making it seem like it's bigoted to 
force people to use a bathroom that 

544
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:44,710
matches their chromosomes and that's 
kind of crazy.

545
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,160
You know?
And it's not saying that you should 

546
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,530
discriminate against transgender people 
or people who feel like they were born 

547
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:52,530
in the wrong sex.
No,

548
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,450
not at all.
Maybe we need to have three fucking 

549
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:57,450
bathrooms.
Yeah.

550
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,050
Maybe we need to.
Probably the easy one.

551
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Maybe it should be male,
female and go for it until you do 

552
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,350
remember in crazy girls.
I don't know if you remember the girl 

553
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,350
that was the MC.

554
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,950
Excuse me.
John was steel.

555
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,160
She was a got a buzzard chopped or 
whatever that is.

556
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,130
I do remember because we met her.
She was.

557
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,500
And I met her and she showed it to joey 
and Joey said it looked like a bat with 

558
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:24,500
its mouth open.
That's hilarious.

559
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,510
That's hilarious.
But she was,

560
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,970
you know,
I was friendly with.

561
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,970
She was great.
She had the mind of a guy,

562
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,230
you know what I mean?
She,

563
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,720
we met with a lot of different guys and 
she was very funny.

564
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,690
She's very funny.
Very funny.

565
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:39,790
She looked a lot like a woman.
Absolutely.

566
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:44,791
If I don't know,
if I would've known if I would have 

567
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:44,791
known,
you know what I'm saying?

568
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:44,791
And this is 19.
What was it,

569
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,830
90 or something or even before that?
Yeah,

570
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,850
so,
but the bottom,

571
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,920
the bottom line about that kind of stuff
is you're not allowed to even talk about

572
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:55,010
it.

573
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,510
If you talk about it,
you're a bigot.

574
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,720
Like we have to leave open the 
possibility.

575
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:03,920
There's some crazy fucks out there.
There's some guys that would just decide

576
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:06,710
that all they have to do to hang on a 
woman's room is dressed like a woman.

577
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,250
That doesn't mean that there's aren't.
They aren't real transgenders.

578
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,860
Like what was the name?
Jonah?

579
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,980
Jonah.
Jonah.

580
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,090
Jonah doesn't like her go into a woman's
bathroom.

581
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,220
Absolutely.
One hundred percent.

582
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,490
But what about Joey Diaz with Joey Diaz 
put on a fucking dress.

583
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,950
I'm not joking around.
I mean that.

584
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:29,210
That is entirely possible.
There is a guy that said that he was,

585
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,480
that he,
he identifies as being a six year old 

586
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,480
girl.
He's a 52 year old man.

587
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,810
He dresses up like a girl.
He's got.

588
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,240
He's got parents,
he's got a daughter,

589
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,900
he's got a family and he identifies as 
being a six year old girl.

590
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,740
I mean,
what,

591
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,770
when do you stop that?
Like is everybody just allowed to play,

592
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:49,100
make believe?
Because understand I think I'm a wolf.

593
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,340
I identify with being a wolf.
I'm going to wear a wolf skin everywhere

594
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:54,710
and I'm going to lift my leg to piss on 
fire hydrants.

595
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,420
Just like a dog.
That's what I'm saying.

596
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,790
I think it's so far everything's so 
broken,

597
00:24:58,791 --> 00:24:59,530
Joel.
Crazy.

598
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,330
It's can't be fixed.
I think Carlin,

599
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,780
George Carlin,
he knew this guy meet that 52 year old 

600
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:07,850
father who identifies as a six year old 
girl.

601
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,300
This is not a joke.
I mean people are out of their fucking 

602
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,900
minds and the thing is so I can't deny I
was married.

603
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:16,580
I can't deny I have children.
He says,

604
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,100
well then you're a fucking father.
What happened to loving yourself?

605
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:27,310
Whatever happened to that,
but it wasn't that something that was 

606
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,310
preached for the longest time.

607
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,700
Love yourself for who you are.
Don't try to change yourself.

608
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,840
Don't look to get your fucking chin 
shaved down,

609
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:36,841
eyebrows raised,
and that knows the plastic surgery world

610
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:38,260
now,
right?

611
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,380
True.
True.

612
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,650
The whole place we showed you will at 
some point,

613
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,460
a lot of these girls are going to look 
exactly the same because you see some of

614
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,140
them now,
just regular girls.

615
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:53,141
Don't you see this and this?
There's a lot of old ladies in my 

616
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:53,141
neighborhood that are fucking monster 
faces.

617
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:54,680
What I call them,
they get that rubber face.

618
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Absolutely.
You know when they shoot the fillers in 

619
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,230
there and the whole face swells up and 
it looks like a monster.

620
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,430
They look alike,
immobile,

621
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,090
Kabuki mask.
The thing is this,

622
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,590
you know,
how do you looking?

623
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,840
You look yourself in the mirror and go,
you know,

624
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,300
it's pretty good.
Hey,

625
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:13,230
this shit.
How many actresses have ruined them?

626
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,000
Ruined their careers because they 
changed their face.

627
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,880
Oh,
quite a few.

628
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,240
Quite a few.
Well,

629
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,010
I think the problem is they think that 
they look different than they look.

630
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,110
You know,
and they think so it's going to work.

631
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,230
They think it's gonna work and then 
everybody else sees them and then they 

632
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,420
see what everybody else sees me.
Oh my God,

633
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,090
what have I done here?
It's dysmorphia.

634
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,150
It's the same thing.
Anorexic,

635
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,070
Savick,
same thing.

636
00:26:34,071 --> 00:26:39,071
Bodybuilders have where they think that 
they look normal and they're fucking 

637
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:39,071
gigantic and they think they're too 
small.

638
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:41,090
You know it's body dysmorphia.
That's what it is.

639
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,950
People are crazy.
I don't have to worry about.

640
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,080
You've always been fine.
It is what it is.

641
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,210
It ain't going to do this.
Here we go.

642
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,440
With that attitude of it is what it is,
is really what we should all have.

643
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,040
I mean that's,
that's how it looked when I was younger.

644
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,440
I was in better shape.
You know,

645
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,340
I played ball.
I was an athlete in college.

646
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,800
I gained weight.
No,

647
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,830
I got laid as much as I wanted when I 
was young and in Vegas and all that,

648
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,010
and then I gained weight.
I try to watch,

649
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,040
but what it is,
I'm not going to change the way I look 

650
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,040
like I got to be a leading man.
It is what it is.

651
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,430
It's a girl says you want makeup during 
the show.

652
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:23,431
It doesn't really matter.
It's just the idea of you being better 

653
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:23,700
looking because you're less shiny.
He didn't know.

654
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:24,680
He has always been a bizarre.

655
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,550
It is what it is.
I'm not an anchorman.

656
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,140
They have a lot of makeup.
You know,

657
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,040
you ever do a talk show,
you looking at the guy,

658
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:35,050
he,
I can't believe how much wake up this 

659
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:35,790
guy take it on.
There's a lot of those shows where they,

660
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,900
they literally change what they look 
like.

661
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,360
Like if you look at them in real life.
Look,

662
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,180
yeah,
they tell you this,

663
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:45,070
you know.
Well HDTV fucked a lot of that people.

664
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,120
I mean,
even myself,

665
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,780
I can.
I,

666
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,030
you don't like to watch myself.
I'm doing blue bloods now.

667
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:53,230
I'm looking at myself and go my heads.
I got to,

668
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,240
I just got a big screen.
Sixty five inch and my head's fucking 

669
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,400
giant.
It's filling up the whole 65 inches.

670
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,370
What?
This blue bloods.

671
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,960
Blue bloods is a CBS.
It's a one hour drama.

672
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,310
Tom Selleck,
Tommy.

673
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:06,270
Well,
Donny Walberg.

674
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,830
Oh,
you're working with Tom Selleck.

675
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:13,170
I started in October to really get you 
into the aisle next to this true shows.

676
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:15,290
Left Friday night.
I got a big one.

677
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,300
I joined in October two.
It's a really good show and they play a 

678
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,240
DA investigator,
so I'm on the other side of the law,

679
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,140
you know.
Nice.

680
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,240
And uh,
it's really good.

681
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,340
The writing's really good.
You'll be surprised.

682
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:28,460
It's a network show and it's really,
really good.

683
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:33,470
It's been a,
they just got picked up for seven 

684
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:33,470
season.
What's Tom Selleck like?

685
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,260
You know,
I met him twice.

686
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,320
I didn't work with them because I'm 
working with,

687
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,310
with bridget Moynahan mostly.
Very nice.

688
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,430
She's great.
Great.

689
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,480
She,
uh,

690
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,510
he came into the trailer,
he said you're doing great work.

691
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:50,511
Thanks for being here.
I'm shook my hand a few times and I 

692
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,530
haven't seen them.
So you don't know because it's Kinda the

693
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:57,531
way it's worked so far is I've worked 
with Donny Walberg once who was a great 

694
00:28:57,531 --> 00:28:58,890
guy and then I worked with her all the 
time.

695
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,570
I haven't worked with anyone else,
you know,

696
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,670
the other guest stars,
but it's been,

697
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,750
it's been good,
you know,

698
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,060
it tragic shooting in New York all over 
the city.

699
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,790
So it's like the city's like another 
character,

700
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:11,430
you know,
it's shooting every borrow.

701
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,800
So you live in New York now?
I live in New York.

702
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:14,780
I lived downtown.
Yeah,

703
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:19,790
I've been there.
I sold my house in Vegas a few years 

704
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,850
ago,
but I've been in there with my family 

705
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:22,850
since about 2002 d like it.
Yeah,

706
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,730
I like it.
Not too crazy.

707
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,870
A little crazy.
It's got the goes a piece of garbage,

708
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,190
you know,
he's a bad guy.

709
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,300
Just a guy.
Yeah.

710
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:35,301
And he,
he put the city in the toilet and 

711
00:29:35,301 --> 00:29:35,940
there's a lot of homeless,
but got rid of the big gulp.

712
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

713
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,290
But Joe,
that's to the other extreme.

714
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:46,291
Now this guy's a jackass.
I mean this guy wanted to separate the 

715
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,110
city between the cops and,
and he did it.

716
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,380
He's a bad guy.
This guy,

717
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:48,870
you know,
just.

718
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,670
And now he's under investigation for one
campaign,

719
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:54,640
fraud and all kinds of shit.
The FBI came in.

720
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,700
So I like it.
It's crazy,

721
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:59,710
but it's great.
There's always something going on.

722
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,170
It's vibrant.
I like southern California,

723
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:02,800
you know,
I'm looking,

724
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,080
you know,
rent the place to here too also.

725
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:07,210
But I like it.
I like Neil,

726
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,160
you know,
I got my friends at and from there,

727
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:09,990
you know,
it's,

728
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:12,000
it's not,
it's insane this,

729
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,400
you know,
you've been spent time there.

730
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,660
It's crazy people.
Yeah.

731
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,760
I looked at a place there for awhile 
while a while ago,

732
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:20,110
like maybe two,
three years ago.

733
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,670
I thought about it.
I said a while here across.

734
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,190
I said,
Mike,

735
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:24,520
if my kids were born there,
you know,

736
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:27,580
both of my daughters grew up there.
I mean my kids were born in Vegas,

737
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:32,581
but they grew up there in New York and 
my wife was born in Vegas and she loves 

738
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:32,581
that.

739
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,400
It's.
I mean,

740
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,800
if you've got some money,
it's not the worst place in the world to

741
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,810
live.
You got to have money because it's 

742
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:40,810
ridiculously expensive.
What's changed too?

743
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:45,661
It's become like bankers,
like a buddy of mine was talking about 

744
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:46,510
that.
It used to be a Judah Judah freelander.

745
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:46,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

746
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,090
Judy was saying that it used to be like 
a lot of artists,

747
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,120
but now this is the problem.
It's in 20 years when like the rent 

748
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:59,581
control shit expires and people's,
you're going to have to be wealthy to 

749
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:03,691
live in Manhattan.
You're going to have to be literally 

750
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:05,761
wealthy,
so all the kids that want to become 

751
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:08,191
comics and artists and actors and 
dancers and they get out of high school 

752
00:31:08,191 --> 00:31:11,290
and college can't afford to live there 
unless they have rich parents or parents

753
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,940
that could help them.
They can't afford.

754
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:16,510
So they living in bedstuy and other 
neighborhoods,

755
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:18,850
which is good for the neighborhoods 
because they're changing.

756
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,510
But they live in four and five to a two 
bedroom apartment.

757
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,780
Yeah.
A buddy of mine got a place in Bedstein 

758
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:27,780
because he was working for a production 
company in New York.

759
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,160
You can't do it any other way.
He said they started a cleaning.

760
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:35,161
The house happened.
They found with all the paint and the 

761
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:35,161
house was lead and he had a kid.
He's like,

762
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,390
we gotta get the fuck out of here,
like this paint.

763
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,970
So you know,
you got to go further out to Queens,

764
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,450
further out to Brooklyn,
you know,

765
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:43,060
where it's still affordable,
but you know,

766
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:46,480
to an hour into the city clock that,
you know by train.

767
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:51,660
But if you could look,
I live in that and I bought a condo 

768
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:51,660
years ago or three bedroom,
you know,

769
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,380
got a nice place.
If you could afford it,

770
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,650
it's great.
But at some point,

771
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,790
if it doesn't stop places are out of 
business stores,

772
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,290
guys who had a business for 30 years,
did the,

773
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,420
you know,
the lease is up.

774
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,530
He's gone.
Yeah.

775
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,050
You know,
it's just everyone's greedy pig.

776
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,620
Well it's just the whole landscape of 
the city is changing and when I talk to 

777
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,590
comics they say the audiences are 
changing too.

778
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,350
It's like you're dealing with like Wall 
Street people are like,

779
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,040
you're.
Yeah.

780
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,240
I haven't been to a comedy club and 
quite awhile I don't.

781
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:21,850
I,
you know,

782
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:23,620
I don't know that uh,
you know what I mean?

783
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:28,621
You got to caroline's and Gotham or 
caroline's is really a tourist trap and 

784
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:31,250
you got Gotham Club.
I mean,

785
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,340
it still is great acts,
but it's not like they don't do like,

786
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
it's not like a big local scene,
you know,

787
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,950
you've got the stand is like a big local
scene.

788
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,410
The seller got,
you've got a lot of clubs were comics 

789
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,820
workout at,
but caroline's is more of like a who,

790
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:48,680
you know,
like someone's out of town,

791
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:53,260
they go in there and they do a weekend 
and you know,

792
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,290
I haven't,
you know,

793
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,640
I'm not privy to that,
but it,

794
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,120
it's uh,
you,

795
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,910
you can't,
those kids that want to,

796
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,660
you want to be an actor,
you better have a rich mother and father

797
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,900
lived there.

798
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:10,180
I lived in new Rochelle because I 
couldn't afford to park my car and I 

799
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,180
needed a car for a road gigs.
Yeah.

800
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,560
But it was not.
I mean it was ridiculous back then.

801
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:17,561
It was expensive,
but I think I moved there in 91 or 92,

802
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,350
somewhere around there.
And I lived there.

803
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,500
I lived in new Rochelle.
I kept an apartment there for three 

804
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:26,860
years.
So 90 to about 90,

805
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,590
somewhere around 95 ish.
I believe that apartments that were 

806
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:32,590
double.
No,

807
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:32,590
no,
no,

808
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,600
it was a small little shitty place in a 
weird neighborhood.

809
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,480
It's just gotten way out of control and 
these land lodge.

810
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:42,290
And I tell you that the blasio's is 
really split the city.

811
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:42,720
I mean,
I,

812
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:44,390
I'm,
I'm not just saying I'm not,

813
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,240
I don't get into politics.
I don't know that.

814
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,330
I think that was his intention.
You know,

815
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:55,331
he's big friends without shopped and 
shopped and sometimes I wonder if this 

816
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:55,331
guy's running the city.

817
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,140
Well,
what do you think a guy like that does?

818
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,100
Why?
Why do they do that?

819
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:03,180
They do it.
Is it a political calculation that like 

820
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,180
they think like this is the way to get 
the black vote.

821
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,700
Oh,
the white people are just going to go 

822
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:07,700
along with.
Absolutely.

823
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,820
And let me tell you another thing.
A guy like our shop and he makes his 

824
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,100
money by shaking people down.
Yeah.

825
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,190
I mean I have a friend of mine who's a 
builder there who I can tell you flat 

826
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,541
out over the years,
he's given them envelopes because you 

827
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:19,541
know,
what they do is they come,

828
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:19,990
they'll say,
you know,

829
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,240
we got the coalition here.
We're going to shut down,

830
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:28,570
going to shut your job down unless you 
hire 10 guys and I'm not even saying 

831
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:28,570
black,
white,

832
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,870
Spanish.
I'm not even saying what it is.

833
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:35,290
This is what these guys do and either 
you hire the 10 guys or they get an 

834
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,450
envelope and this was,
goes on.

835
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,310
This is what goes on.
Well,

836
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,620
Jesse Jackson's been cancer that 
forever.

837
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,050
Jesse Jackson and this was a fact,
uh,

838
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,100
the uh,
in Vegas in the eighties to frontier was

839
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:52,550
on strike for like six or seven years 
from the food and beverage.

840
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,260
You know,
the way it is in the protests.

841
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,860
They paid him 25 grand to march with 
them down the strip.

842
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,860
They closed the,
stripped out 25 grand.

843
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,800
Why people are coming up to Jesse 
Jackson going,

844
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,810
hey,
you know,

845
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,320
that's great.
Thank you man.

846
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,300
Thank you.
Thank you.

847
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,700
And in the meantime he got paid.
Yeah,

848
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:13,370
well that was his hustle.
The Rainbow Coalition.

849
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:18,371
They come in and do the whole thing is 
diversity lessons to everybody that 

850
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:18,371
worked there,
you know,

851
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:19,320
they would,
they would have these clinics.

852
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:21,530
So they teach people how to be more 
diverse.

853
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
This is what's out shopping and done.
He owes taxes.

854
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:30,281
He owes.
That couldn't be a bigger hustler.

855
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:33,230
I think he could kill somebody in broad 
daylight.

856
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:38,231
He'll get away.
So he walked in front of the comedy 

857
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:38,231
store.
One night he was walking down the street

858
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:42,710
walking right in front of the comedy 
store and me and a bunch of other 

859
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,981
comedians just started heckling him as 
he was walking by how shopped and get 

860
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,600
that money.
Go get that money out.

861
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,680
He's a hustler.
We ain't mad at you.

862
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,850
Go get that money.
I mean,

863
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:58,851
he's been in the White House.
How many times the guys in the White 

864
00:35:58,851 --> 00:35:58,851
House.
Not only that,

865
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:03,771
if you go back to his history,
there's no white guy would have ever 

866
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:03,771
gotten away with that.
And he would.

867
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:06,270
He did.
Was he got into the public's eye because

868
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:10,140
of false rape accusations?
Totally made up stories.

869
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,150
He's never admitted to that.
No.

870
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,730
Bullying was proven.
I mean it was absolutely proven lowly 

871
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:18,990
and they,
you've ruined the guys life up there and

872
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,390
then that guy shoot and yeah.

873
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,000
Well,
so keeps telling.

874
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,280
He's in the White House.
He's in the window.

875
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,150
So we go on and on and on.
I mean that happen.

876
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,180
How does someone not step away from 
that?

877
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,040
That's why I'm telling you.
It's so broken.

878
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,530
Can't be fixed.
You've got to drop out of sight.

879
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:35,310
Joe,
what are we going to do?

880
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,610
I don't know.
Alaska is.

881
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,120
I don't think that's.
I think an accurate China like it up 

882
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,120
there.
Hawaii.

883
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,360
Dangerous Sharks.
The waves.

884
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:47,980
The fucking you'd go anymore.
I don't know.

885
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,540
I'll be in the middle of the ocean.
It's just too dangerous.

886
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:56,541
Although it has been there for thousands
of years and I won't be here for 

887
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:56,541
thousands of years.
So it's tempting in that regard.

888
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,770
We're doomed.
Doomed.

889
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,830
I Dunno.
I like where people are so I'm thinking 

890
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:03,830
Montana,
that might be a good spot.

891
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,810
They don't give a fuck.
Not many people.

892
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,420
They don't give up on patrol lives of 
Montana.

893
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,470
Absolutely.
Harris.

894
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:11,810
Pete and retro.
That's right.

895
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,410
Harris.
Pete used to take care of his place,

896
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:14,480
right?
They live up there.

897
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,460
No,
they don't live together.

898
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,140
No.
Harris Pete.

899
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:24,141
Yeah.
It's like how could we all get along 

900
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:24,620
with Harris is a.
I was up there.

901
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:27,930
It's a strange place.
It's not a bad place,

902
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,720
just not for me.
I'm not one of them.

903
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:31,040
Yeah.
I'm not an outdoor guy.

904
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,540
Can't.
You can't do anything.

905
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,500
I can't change a light bulb.
Light Bulb.

906
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:40,200
I got to call the guy downstairs.
Could you change the bulb?

907
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,250
I got to live in a doorman building the 
doorman building.

908
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,090
That's your environment,
your natural.

909
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:52,350
Yet I got a tip.
Somebody your natural habitats with 

910
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,080
doorman building.
That's fucking hilarious.

911
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,310
Tip somebody to do it.
So,

912
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:58,230
uh,
you're making spaghetti sauce now.

913
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,170
I ate it last night and I had it today.
I just want to tell you.

914
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,060
It's very good.
It's very good.

915
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:08,061
So no bullshit.
How the fuck did you get involved in 

916
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:08,061
making spaghetti sauce?
I had my buddy,

917
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:08,970
my buddy Joe,
right?

918
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:14,350
Uh,
my mother had passed away a few years 

919
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:14,350
ago.
He said,

920
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:14,350
let's do something for your mother.
Come on,

921
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:14,350
let's duchamp.
You know,

922
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,380
he's an entrepreneurial kind of guy,
you know,

923
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,430
and uh,
so we got the recipe and I,

924
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:21,450
my wife runs marathons,
she's healthy,

925
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:22,560
she eats organic,
blah,

926
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:22,860
blah,
blah.

927
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,800
We made it organic.
It took a while.

928
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,920
We had to throw out a lot of sauce and 
give it to shelters and stuff like that 

929
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,570
because it was too loose and it was,
you know,

930
00:38:31,571 --> 00:38:33,810
not bad.
It just wasn't prevalent wanted.

931
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,700
We got it.
It's organic.

932
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:38,230
Gluten free,
non GMO,

933
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:43,290
uncle Steve's.
She'd go to uncle Steve's and wide that 

934
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:43,290
come.
We sell it.

935
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,740
It's just we just got here an 
Albertsons,

936
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,840
Vons pavilion.

937
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,350
We're in a whole foods fairway,
uh,

938
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:51,400
all over the country.
Women,

939
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:53,440
3000 stores.
There it is right here.

940
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:56,370
Uncle Steve say,
hey dude,

941
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,910
if you didn't know it came out of a job 
and I'm not like,

942
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:00,820
I don't need jobs.
So it's,

943
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:05,821
you know,
that's that whole Italian thing and I 

944
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:07,000
never did just because I never did.
My wife would cook,

945
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:08,080
you know,
and when I was a kid,

946
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,350
my mother,
my grandmother and the sauces that good.

947
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,290
My wife hasn't made sauce in a long 
time.

948
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,790
Yeah,
I ate it last night.

949
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,960
Like I said,
I ate it this morning.

950
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,000
I ate some this morning.
I'll send you more.

951
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:21,950
We've got three kinds of cases.
You sent me six tomato,

952
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,680
tomato base,
or did you try to our big Yada?

953
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,080
Ya Know,
I've only tried the marijuana.

954
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,130
The I will be out as very spicy.
Very like it.

955
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,940
It's the biggest seller,
but it's hot.

956
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,240
Keep it away from the kids.
Yeah.

957
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:32,800
Oh yeah.
No,

958
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,070
no,
no,

959
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:33,710
no.
It's that.

960
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,520
It's spicy.
It's good.

961
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,230
Smart people.
Like my kids,

962
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,120
they're,
my kids are 20 slash 24.

963
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:41,170
They like you,
they can handle it.

964
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,810
But uh,
not for me to offer me.

965
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:46,560
You don't like spicy?
Not Spicy Guy.

966
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,160
No.
So I mean,

967
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,030
fuck,
that's amazing,

968
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,910
you know,
that way we don't have to go sit in A.

969
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:57,550
I don't have to sit in the waiting room 
in addition for bullshit.

970
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,130
Yeah.
I mean that's always a good idea to have

971
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,350
alternate sources.
I think,

972
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:01,780
you know,
uh,

973
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,210
you don't remember this.
We auditioned for something.

974
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,730
It was a movie,
uh,

975
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,390
not the same role,
but it was a movie guy,

976
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,680
Dave Sheridan,
you know?

977
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,590
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

978
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,210
And we were there and I said to you,
who's that fucking guy?

979
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:21,210
And you and I don't know what the fuck 
he was the star of the movie and he 

980
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:21,210
heard us.
I've talked about it.

981
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,580
I got that movie.
I did that.

982
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,560
I talked about that story because not 
not you auditioning,

983
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:28,810
but that whole movie story.
Because that kid was talented.

984
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,130
Yeah,
he was funny as shit.

985
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:33,220
He was doing okay.
I don't know what that movie was.

986
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:38,221
Dog Shit.
And one of the reasons why I was dog 

987
00:40:38,221 --> 00:40:40,141
shit because all of these executives,
because he was funny and they made him 

988
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:43,891
the star of the movie,
but he was a nobody as far as like 

989
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:44,110
people didn't know who he was.
They all were telling them what to do.

990
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,260
Like I watched a guy with a fucking 
rolex on and expensive move in 

991
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,000
suspenders,
a frank mccluskey cio.

992
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:53,290
That's it.
That's that.

993
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,050
Because I did a movie with a producer.

994
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:01,770
I did his movie before that did the 
movie where he was trying to put a hit 

995
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,960
on the dogs.
He spotted me.

996
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,000
Paul Sevino.
Oh,

997
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:07,750
that's hilarious.
And then I met you.

998
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:12,751
You just happen to be.
Then I was there and he was across the 

999
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:13,510
way from us saying,
who's this fucking Dave?

1000
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:15,600
Sharon,
and I say,

1001
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,740
so he was the star and I didn't know who
he was.

1002
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,170
I didn't get it.
I worked for an attorney.

1003
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:23,020
I think I bought him return well when I 
was on the set,

1004
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,090
like the kid was really funny.
He's really talented.

1005
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,320
He's a very funny,
like real slapsticky big like Jim Carrey

1006
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:34,130
style comic actor and this guy with the 
Rolex and the cufflinks and the tailored

1007
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,010
suit and suspenders.
Super Rich Guy.

1008
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,870
Right?
He's given them line readings.

1009
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,430
I mean he's telling this kid like 
literally when you come in,

1010
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,600
when you come in,
I want you to go,

1011
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,630
what is he like?
He's,

1012
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,180
he's acting it out and he's like telling
them how to do it and then he sits there

1013
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,610
in front of the camera and make sure the
guy does it exactly the way he wants her

1014
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:53,780
to do it.
And you see Dave,

1015
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,710
Sharon and gone,
what the fuck is this shit?

1016
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,670
I got to do this because the kid was 
naturally funny.

1017
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,850
And when you got someone who's funny,
one of the last thing you want to do is 

1018
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,280
tell them how to be funny.
Just leave them the fuck alone.

1019
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:09,670
Make them feel comfortable.
Make them feel comfortable telling them 

1020
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,150
about somebody would come and cents.
Well they just have so much money.

1021
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,650
They have so much money and they have so
much influence and they want to,

1022
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:16,600
they want to make that monkey dance.
I haven't seen.

1023
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,060
I don't know if he's working.
I don't know.

1024
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,330
I haven't,
I haven't,

1025
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,300
I don't know.
But it's just so I have a window.

1026
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,590
Was a nice guy though.
I've worked with them.

1027
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:25,670
I had a great time.
He was real nice.

1028
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,490
You know?
Uh,

1029
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:31,620
it's just like comics is a goal.
A guy manages of the club.

1030
00:42:32,371 --> 00:42:35,040
Used to tell them what to try to do 
their act.

1031
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,050
What the fuck.
I never told the guy ever.

1032
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,630
He never told the guy,
you know,

1033
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,970
there's certain things I got the Riv you
couldn't do like this.

1034
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:46,320
Don't knock the hotel.
Right.

1035
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,050
You know,
don't,

1036
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,050
don't knock tell,
don't say the whole,

1037
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:51,870
it's a shit hole in this shenanigans.
Like I hired a guy,

1038
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:53,430
he,
he went on the radio,

1039
00:42:53,431 --> 00:42:57,090
he was saying what a shit hole up a pie 
and I,

1040
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,490
you know,
my boss called me and he said,

1041
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,650
this guy who's just fucking guy in 
radio,

1042
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:03,540
and I went,
he said he's gone,

1043
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,090
don't bring them back.
So I called the guy said,

1044
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:08,040
why didn't you do that?
I gave you a job now,

1045
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,840
why the fuck did you do that?

1046
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,940
I think they're being cute and I don't 
get it.

1047
00:43:11,941 --> 00:43:13,710
So you can't,
you can't come back,

1048
00:43:13,711 --> 00:43:16,110
you know.
But I never would tell someone,

1049
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,490
hey joe,
that joke you did,

1050
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:18,130
you know,
uh,

1051
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,680
that's not funny.
Don't do that joke,

1052
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,300
you know,
to that guy used to give me,

1053
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,770
they were working as a busboy three 
weeks ago.

1054
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,140
Now they're running a comedy club and 
they're telling you what to do.

1055
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,130
Well Pat always amazed that though.
They like telling people what to do.

1056
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:33,960
They always have,
I understand that.

1057
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:38,961
But you know,
you because you got the job at the club 

1058
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:42,531
or whatever.
Now suddenly you're in show business 

1059
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:42,531
again.
You're speaking like logic.

1060
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:43,420
Come in,
show business.

1061
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,420
I mean,
you know how suddenly,

1062
00:43:45,421 --> 00:43:45,720
you know

1063
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,510
you can't make sense.
There's no sense in this town.

1064
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:51,400
It's not a sense town.
This is not a sense business.

1065
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,720
This is a business of navigating egos 
and trying to find your own voice.

1066
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:57,600
Nice.

1067
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:00,740
When you're getting your own ego,
it's nice when you don't have to,

1068
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,030
uh,
you know,

1069
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,620
when you don't have to,
you know,

1070
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:09,120
you're not struggling and you know,
and it's okay and you can tell a guy to 

1071
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,800
fuck off and I'm not going to do that.
And you know what?

1072
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:11,300
Fuck you man,
I'm not coming.

1073
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,800
I'm not working for that money in that 
thing.

1074
00:44:13,801 --> 00:44:15,900
And exactly don't get no fuck.
Fortunately,

1075
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,320
not everybody.
I don't have fuck you money.

1076
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:21,650
I have fuck money,
but you know the fuck you.

1077
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:24,020
Money is nice.
You know where you don't have to,

1078
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,260
but it's hard.
It's hard to get to that point,

1079
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:31,261
man.
It's very hard to get fucking money and 

1080
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:31,261
most people want to get fuck you money.
They're always terrified.

1081
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:31,261
They're going to lose the fuck you 
money.

1082
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:32,100
So never say fuck you.

1083
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,870
Fuck you.
Money is wasted.

1084
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,310
And the people that are afraid to say,
fuck you.

1085
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,950
Well said.
Very well said.

1086
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,810
It's just so funny.
No one knew for so long and then seeing 

1087
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,760
you doing so well now as an actor.
And I mean it's,

1088
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,770
it's a beautiful thing.
It's also beautiful for me because I 

1089
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:51,990
know that you're not,
you're not a classically trained actor.

1090
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,720
And I've always told people it's not 
that fucking hard.

1091
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:00,080
This is not like a guy who's never done 
it before stepping in and doing brain 

1092
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,080
surgery.

1093
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,080
No,
of course,

1094
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,220
of course.
But,

1095
00:45:00,221 --> 00:45:01,640
you know,
listen,

1096
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,420
I got the job on the apprentice.
I did everything like opposite.

1097
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,190
Of course I had been dabbling here and 
there.

1098
00:45:06,191 --> 00:45:11,191
Right.
So then I got the job and then I worked 

1099
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:11,191
with a coach and I still work with a 
coach now.

1100
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:12,520
But when I got a big episode on blue 
blood,

1101
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:15,460
she comes over the house.
It's a dog,

1102
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,570
you know,
Donald's friend join?

1103
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:17,540
Objection,
you know.

1104
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,320
No,
she's not working with a lot of cooks.

1105
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,190
She could comes over the house.
I go over the lines we talk about

1106
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,970
when you do that.
Um,

1107
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,420
do you,
do you like read with her?

1108
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:28,240
Does she read along?

1109
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,360
Yeah,
what I'll do is,

1110
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:30,050
you know,
uh,

1111
00:45:30,051 --> 00:45:35,051
you know,
what I'll do is I started learning the 

1112
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:37,421
lines,
then we'll talk about it or what do you 

1113
00:45:37,421 --> 00:45:37,421
think?
Hey,

1114
00:45:37,421 --> 00:45:40,271
I have my ideas are ready.
She'll give me some notes and that's a 

1115
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,781
good idea.
It's good to get even getting the Fini 

1116
00:45:43,781 --> 00:45:46,430
had two different acting cultures.
He worked with this girl Susan for years

1117
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:48,470
that helped you get a different 
perspective.

1118
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,370
Oh,
you know what,

1119
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,490
I didn't think of that.
I didn't think that one.

1120
00:45:51,491 --> 00:45:52,460
Yeah,
you're right there.

1121
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,990
So that kind of shit.
Now look,

1122
00:45:53,991 --> 00:45:56,600
ultimately you get on the set,
you're going to do what you're doing.

1123
00:45:56,601 --> 00:45:59,120
The director's gonna Hey Steve,
you know,

1124
00:45:59,121 --> 00:46:01,100
you shouldn't be so angry.
They're whatever,

1125
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:02,900
you know,
he thinks and the guy that wrote it,

1126
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:08,080
you know what I mean?
But I worked very hard at it and I 

1127
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,770
worked for years now.
Now don't forget I'm making a living for

1128
00:46:09,771 --> 00:46:13,490
16 years as an accurate and I left the 
Riviera in 2000.

1129
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,450
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah.

1130
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:16,010
Sixteen years.
So,

1131
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:17,270
and I've done a lot of shit.

1132
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,220
This is you saying that 2016 years ago 
makes me go,

1133
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:22,690
what?
Is that right?

1134
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,680
Yeah,
I left there.

1135
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,800
I started on the Sopranos in [inaudible]
99.

1136
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:27,870
I went back and forth for a year.
You know,

1137
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:29,520
I didn't quit.
The judge did six episodes.

1138
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:34,521
I was still at the.
What is it like how it must've been 

1139
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:34,521
fucking strange.
I was still at the river.

1140
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:37,710
Then I booked it for 10 years.
I know I booked the river until 2010.

1141
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,960
Chris Rock said you're still dipping 
your toe

1142
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,500
when that shit.
I said,

1143
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:44,020
why not me?
What the fuck?

1144
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:44,980
How hard is it?
Hard?

1145
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:46,810
Is it to fuck a book?
Three comics a week.

1146
00:46:46,811 --> 00:46:49,030
I could do it in three days.
Booked up six months.

1147
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:54,060
That's hilarious.
You know the book I book guys that you 

1148
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:54,060
know,
that didn't work much,

1149
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,831
you know.
Well I think your point is a really 

1150
00:46:58,831 --> 00:46:59,080
important part of what you're saying is 
like the getting a different perspective

1151
00:46:59,081 --> 00:47:00,700
or a guy like Kendall feeney.
You would,

1152
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:05,730
you'd imagine he was so good.
You would imagine that he probably 

1153
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:05,730
looked at it from all sorts of different
things.

1154
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:06,640
Yes,
he did.

1155
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:09,880
And you saw a lot of different colors,
but he,

1156
00:47:09,881 --> 00:47:12,130
you know,
he would work 16 hours,

1157
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,370
16 hour days on the Sopranos.
He's in,

1158
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,400
he's there.
So I mean the guy gets up whatever time 

1159
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,251
you got up,
then he's got to go home and learn 

1160
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:25,561
tomorrow stuff.
So sometimes he told me he'd be sitting 

1161
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:27,460
in the chair.
He Fall Asleep for two hours.

1162
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,520
He wakes up,
she's still just waiting for him to wake

1163
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:33,070
up and they're going to work on the 
stuff with tomorrow.

1164
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,420
Whoa.
Yeah.

1165
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:36,100
And then,
and nine months of that,

1166
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:37,660
don't forget,
you know the Sopranos,

1167
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:38,260
Joe,
they were,

1168
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,260
when I got on the show was like eight 
days.

1169
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:46,350
I came on the second season,
so it was like eight days for an 

1170
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,570
episode.
They're nine and 10 at the list season.

1171
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,160
It was,
we did,

1172
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,310
we shot nine shows in nine months.

1173
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,170
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1174
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,790
You know,
it was like shooting a movie.

1175
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,800
There's no commercials,
so it's a full hour,

1176
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,780
but you know,
that's what it was,

1177
00:47:58,781 --> 00:47:59,710
man.
It was long.

1178
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,320
It was like shooting a movie.
Wow.

1179
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,740
I mean,
month and episode.

1180
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,090
The first episode was 17,
18 working days.

1181
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,620
The rain,
brock was said to me,

1182
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:11,320
you're going to work more in this 
separate so that I will the whole season

1183
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,090
because she only worked one day in 
episode,

1184
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:18,130
you know,
she had the greatest job in show 

1185
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:18,130
business.
They shot that in one day.

1186
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:18,250
Oh,
that's beautiful.

1187
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:20,500
For her.
Was a great part two.

1188
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,370
Yeah,
it was great.

1189
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,350
You know,
but I,

1190
00:48:22,351 --> 00:48:25,810
I think the coaching wise,
and I think a lot of it is,

1191
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,640
you know,
you focus and concentrate,

1192
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:30,040
know your stuff,
know your lines.

1193
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:30,850
I mean,
you're an actor,

1194
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,530
you know,
know your shit.

1195
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:34,600
Don't come in and be like a smart ass.

1196
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,130
Yeah.
Maybe I paraphrase.

1197
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:39,100
Know your stuff,
respect what's on the page.

1198
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,800
You know that I'm a,
I'm a big believer in that.

1199
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:47,380
The Sopranos,
you didn't Ad Lib the word thought and 

1200
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,160
I'm not joking you.
There was a,

1201
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:50,030
there was a time that I had to say,
uh,

1202
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:54,310
I got to go and the line was I have to 
go.

1203
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,250
And they kept correcting me and correct 
me.

1204
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:58,100
Correct,
because I just,

1205
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:59,400
you know,
I gotta go home.

1206
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,790
I have to go.
I don't know why,

1207
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,370
why,
when I didn't question it.

1208
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:04,690
I mean,
you know,

1209
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,920
but that's a crazy amount of work where 
you're talking about Kendall feeney.

1210
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:10,990
That's really,
that's still fucking with my head.

1211
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,390
Now listen,
Jim was one of my closest friends,

1212
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:17,910
couldn't find a better guy.
He worked hardly stories.

1213
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,050
Kids,
you know,

1214
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,170
his kids,
you know,

1215
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,210
uh,
his daughter wasn't born,

1216
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,310
you know,
uh,

1217
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,550
while he was on the sopranos,
but it was like no life.

1218
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:32,110
You could completely gave up your life 
and not the rest of us because there was

1219
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:33,400
so many characters,
you know,

1220
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:38,401
I didn't,
I had a couple of episodes where I 

1221
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:38,401
worked a real lot,
but you know,

1222
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:39,430
other words,
this can't be good for your health.

1223
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,330
And.
Well it was a,

1224
00:49:40,331 --> 00:49:41,410
you know,
a lot of guys.

1225
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:41,840
I mean,
I've,

1226
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:42,530
I've heard,
uh,

1227
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:47,540
I think Jimmy Smith's,
I read years ago and ypd he said he 

1228
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,950
couldn't take it was 18,
18 hour days and yeah,

1229
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:51,340
it was making a fortune.
He said I couldn't do it anymore.

1230
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:51,910
Yeah,
no,

1231
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:52,240
I've,
I've,

1232
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:57,300
I've had friends that have been on 
dramas before and there's the same 

1233
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:57,300
thing.
He would tell me that they just,

1234
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,990
they just couldn't do it and they would 
just,

1235
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,390
would be when the season would wrap 
their to go,

1236
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:05,530
this has got to be my last season.
I a point with the money now,

1237
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:06,690
you know,
the thing,

1238
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,210
what I love about blue bloods is there's
a lot of characters,

1239
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,220
so there's different stories.

1240
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,300
So it's not like that.
It's,

1241
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,980
it's,
it's quite nice.

1242
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:17,020
It's a beautiful show and you know,
like you said,

1243
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:21,220
the writing's good network show,
but you know,

1244
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:22,570
with Jim,
but he worked with,

1245
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,510
you know,
a lot of,

1246
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,830
like a dirty secret.
Working with an acting coach isn't,

1247
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,000
that's a dirty little secret.
People don't want it.

1248
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:31,750
Some people don't want to admit.
I think if you're a bigger,

1249
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,760
I think pachino works with somebody.
Why don't know why there would be a 

1250
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,701
dirty secret.
I would think that would be just 

1251
00:50:39,701 --> 00:50:39,701
practice.
That'd be a good.

1252
00:50:39,701 --> 00:50:39,701
No,
but I think like,

1253
00:50:39,701 --> 00:50:43,441
uh,
like guys don't want to admit that I'm 

1254
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:43,750
asking for him right now.
Guys say if I could ask this are,

1255
00:50:43,751 --> 00:50:48,751
you know,
comedians have a thing about that with 

1256
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:49,370
writers working with writers like 
comedian working with a writer.

1257
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:54,371
It's like other comedians will shake 
their head and look down on you really 

1258
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:54,371
don't.

1259
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:58,080
I don't understand that you write all 
your own stuff obviously because your 

1260
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,640
stuff is very personal,
but they were all guys that it's 

1261
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,750
impossible for them to keep writing new 
material.

1262
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,420
Well these guys that are very personal,
but they have someone to work with.

1263
00:51:05,421 --> 00:51:10,421
Kevin Hart has guys that work with them,
like he has ideas and he bounces them 

1264
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:10,830
off these ideas,
these,

1265
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,760
he's got these guys,
these ideas off these guys and then they

1266
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:15,110
work on them together.
Like you'll,

1267
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,100
he'll brainstorm with guys on his act,
which is nothing wrong with it.

1268
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:24,101
Chris rock used to do that.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

1269
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:24,101
with that.
But then there's guys like say a Leno or

1270
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:26,750
Rodney who I was a big rodney 
dangerfield.

1271
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,420
Sure.
Everybody just comics,

1272
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:31,730
facts and stuff into him all over the 
place.

1273
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,530
You know,
Leno.

1274
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:34,850
I mean he was doing the show.

1275
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,820
He's busy in his monologue there,
right in this stuff,

1276
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,340
but not as standup.
Like when Lento does it stand up.

1277
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:42,580
His standup is pretty much all leno.
It's all him.

1278
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:48,190
But Rodney for sure.
And if there was a lot of guys like Bob 

1279
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:48,350
Hope,
Bob Hope had five,

1280
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,070
six,
seven,

1281
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:51,020
eight.
He had a staff of writers.

1282
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,140
I know one of them,
he would pay $50 a joke and then the 

1283
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,010
only tip 37,
$50 job.

1284
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,390
Mothers,
the richest guys ever the fuck it was,

1285
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,970
but he was,
he would ask for a,

1286
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,290
you know,
I need whatever,

1287
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,240
whatever the event was,
you know,

1288
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:11,060
I need jokes about trump or 
mother-in-law,

1289
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,060
this,
this,

1290
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:18,090
you know,
I guess comics don't want to admit to 

1291
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:18,090
it,
but there are comics that by no,

1292
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,820
you know,
there definitely are.

1293
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,390
And there's nothing wrong with it.
Like,

1294
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,150
well first of all,
Richard Pryor,

1295
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:25,700
who was the greatest of all time,
Paul Mooney wrote farm forever.

1296
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,380
Yeah.
And other guys wrote for him.

1297
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:32,560
And like I said,
Chris Rock was also one of the greatest 

1298
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,200
of all time.
Chris had a bunch of writers and smart.

1299
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:38,201
He knows how to make the best comedy and
it's not necessarily always just with 

1300
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:39,440
your own mind,
like sometimes it's so hard.

1301
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,350
It's not easy for someone else to find 
your voice,

1302
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,160
so you have to find those guys and it's 
not easy because she,

1303
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,400
I could say,
hey man,

1304
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:47,840
you know,
write me either.

1305
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,790
Sometimes like when I have to hold 
something,

1306
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:55,300
like I hosted this a thing on TV.
I'm not saying I'm not making believe 

1307
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,180
I'm a stand up.
I'm not a standup comic,

1308
00:52:56,181 --> 00:52:59,270
nor would I even attempt,
but it's more like a monologue,

1309
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,970
you know?
Even if I have to host a charity event,

1310
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,780
I have a guy who likes me jokes,
but he's,

1311
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,230
I get my voice shit that I would say,
you know what I mean?

1312
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:11,230
And you know immediately and you know,
well sometimes it's not a bad idea to 

1313
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,611
have a writer just because you have a 
couple other guys that you can talk 

1314
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:15,611
about your set with,
you know,

1315
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:16,910
because if you're just looking at it 
yourself,

1316
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,610
like we were talking about having a 
different perspective.

1317
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:24,820
Maybe even they don't write the jokes,
but they talk about the jokes that 

1318
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,460
you've written and give their 
perspective and alone will probably help

1319
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:27,750
you improve them.
I agree.

1320
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:31,620
And I think if you're doing a live show,
if you're hosting something,

1321
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:35,160
whether it be an award show or whatever,
to have a couple of guys there,

1322
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,520
a spur of the moment thing,
give you some,

1323
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,820
a joke.
Here's a good line.

1324
00:53:38,821 --> 00:53:39,350
But,
but uh,

1325
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,750
you know,
spur of the moment is very well,

1326
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,060
especially a live show,
like a talk show or something like that.

1327
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,660
Very important to have writers.
Do you like doing talk shows?

1328
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,010
No.
You don't like it?

1329
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,230
No,
I don't like to just like doing this.

1330
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:54,390
This is what I like because there's no 
format.

1331
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,200
When you do a talk show,
it's all shut off field of view when 

1332
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,330
they're going to.
I'm going to say this,

1333
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:02,640
you're going to say that and then a lot 
of time want to do it.

1334
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:07,110
A talk show host has the joke,
the joke on top of your job,

1335
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,740
right?
He's already got the retort.

1336
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,600
Exactly.
I just don't.

1337
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:15,860
They just seems fake and forced while he
right back now.

1338
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,040
Now you have to sing and dance.
I don't know.

1339
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:23,720
You have to be a variety show like the 
guy.

1340
00:54:23,721 --> 00:54:24,500
Uh,
you know,

1341
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,670
that's,
that's the new thing.

1342
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:28,220
I appreciate a guy like Jimmy Fallon,
who does it well.

1343
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:30,350
I think he's great at it.
I really appreciate it.

1344
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:31,710
I just don't want to do it.
I just don't.

1345
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:33,860
I don't want to be a guest.
I don't want to watch.

1346
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,720
I don't,
I don't want to sit there.

1347
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,030
I've had friends that do them.
I go visit them while they do it.

1348
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,600
Like I watched Conan and the other day I
had a buddy of mine who was singing the 

1349
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:43,600
song and cone and I went to watch and I 
was like,

1350
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,850
get the fuck out of here.
I think it's a dying format.

1351
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,500
I think it's a format that's like a 
dinosaur.

1352
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,250
Well,
I think it is,

1353
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:52,910
which is why you see this guy on cbs,
James,

1354
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:56,060
whatever his name is,
he's singing karaoke in the car.

1355
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,890
Who?
This Guy James,

1356
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,290
according as his name.
James Corden.

1357
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,480
They sing.
Karaoke is mixing it up.

1358
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,580
He's doing different time.
Yeah,

1359
00:55:03,581 --> 00:55:06,350
and he's got two different office.
He had a deli at this one.

1360
00:55:06,351 --> 00:55:11,351
They're trying to do different stuff and
I think it's become more like that than 

1361
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:12,830
just to sit down old fashion,
you know,

1362
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,750
because first of all,
you know,

1363
00:55:14,751 --> 00:55:19,310
and I know most actors,
whatever celebrities,

1364
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:23,270
they don't have a whole lot to say.
Some people like Deniro.

1365
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:26,210
If it ain't on the page,
just guy is stuck at hello.

1366
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,850
You say hello to him.
He stopped for a fucking answer.

1367
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:30,080
How is that possible?
Well,

1368
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:35,081
because he's got to have it on the page 
and then he's a wonderful actor and he 

1369
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:35,330
could forgive you all this,
but if he.

1370
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,700
You think he's going to come in here and
talk to you like this?

1371
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,720
I don't know.
Shit.

1372
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:39,470
No,
no.

1373
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:42,410
Hell No.
You never spoke to him.

1374
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,830
My friend Joey,
Joey Diaz.

1375
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,000
You Know Joe Joe?
He did a movie with him.

1376
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:47,930
Yeah,
he enjoyed it.

1377
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,780
He liked it.
It was just an honor.

1378
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,900
You know what I mean?
You're working with arguably the 

1379
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,030
greatest actor of all time,
top five,

1380
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,330
but I don't think he's ever seen him to 
try to do a talk show.

1381
00:55:59,331 --> 00:56:02,000
It's never boring.
Look at some clips.

1382
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:04,040
Well,
I think he's an interesting guy.

1383
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,320
You know,
Deniro is a very unusual guy.

1384
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,660
I think he's done a lot of crappy stuff 
and I don't know.

1385
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:15,070
I don't understand how much money do you
need that I know you want to work and 

1386
00:56:15,801 --> 00:56:17,640
this is what you do for a living and I 
get it,

1387
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:19,040
but you know.

1388
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,050
Yeah,
he's done some shitty movies for sure,

1389
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:24,190
like really shitty movies,
but I think he's probably.

1390
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,380
Well that was the recent one.
You did the temp.

1391
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,920
I watched the ad and I just.
My whole soul starts shaking like I was 

1392
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,040
freezing to death.
Like you know,

1393
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,090
I,
I don't know.

1394
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:39,320
Boy,
he owns the restaurant and she's got to 

1395
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:39,320
a hotel in Vegas.
Nobo.

1396
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,970
He's got a million restaurants.
She's got these old tales at Tribeca 

1397
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,650
film festival.
And at what point in time are you gonna?

1398
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,150
What are you gonna do with that money 
when you die?

1399
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,990
He just enjoys doing shitty movies.
Well,

1400
00:56:48,991 --> 00:56:50,410
I don't think.
Enjoy shitty movies.

1401
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:54,880
I think he enjoys doing movies.
I've got to say that there's a whole lot

1402
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:58,130
of great roles for second city,
70 something years,

1403
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:02,110
you know,
Pachino seems to navigate them better.

1404
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,720
Yeah,
sorta.

1405
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,810
He does some shitty fucking movies too,
but I think these guys,

1406
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:12,811
you know,
they get up in age and the roles they 

1407
00:57:12,811 --> 00:57:15,781
don't get offered the best roles and 
then something comes along and it's not 

1408
00:57:15,781 --> 00:57:16,070
that good,
but it's a lot of money and the guy,

1409
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:16,510
fuck it.

1410
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,130
Who Cares?
And they just do it.

1411
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,110
And the other thing is a guy like 
Pachino,

1412
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:23,680
he has so much leeway because he can 
kind of do whatever the fuck you want.

1413
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:28,950
Same as as Deniro.
Like what was that one movie Deniro did 

1414
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,400
recently?
There was a fucking shit.

1415
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:35,450
The name of that movie,
the movie with Bradley Cooper and 

1416
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,981
Jennifer Lawrence.
It was a big movie and Deniro played in 

1417
00:57:37,981 --> 00:57:37,981
the hustle.
Yes.

1418
00:57:37,981 --> 00:57:40,390
He was good at that.
So he's still got it.

1419
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,930
He's still got it.
He can still do it and seem like,

1420
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,540
like a really dangerous fuck.
It's still possible to see those,

1421
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,190
those,
those,

1422
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,590
those roles don't exist that often.
No,

1423
00:57:51,591 --> 00:57:53,410
it doesn't.
As you said that,

1424
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,600
and as I think as we get older too,
you know,

1425
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,880
physically,
you know,

1426
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:58,780
you change,
you know,

1427
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:03,810
just like,
just like a guy that was just wonderful 

1428
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:04,870
leading man in his thirties,
you know,

1429
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,140
now he's a fucking bloated guy in his 
fifties,

1430
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:08,710
you know what I mean?

1431
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,620
He can't be the same guy.
Yeah.

1432
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,630
Bloated,
you know Val Kilmer,

1433
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,560
right?
Like that kind of thing.

1434
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:16,330
I worked with him.
How was he?

1435
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,100
He was nice,
but out there,

1436
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,800
he's out there.
I did a movie in Detroit with him.

1437
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:25,801
He was way out that,
I don't know if you remember how he 

1438
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:27,630
likes to mushrooms.
Maybe he was on him that day because we 

1439
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:28,390
shot a movie out there and he was way 
out there.

1440
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:29,440
He was heavy then.
Yeah.

1441
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:34,540
Now he did something in Africa with 
somebody and they said he got whacked 

1442
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:37,561
out on mushrooms.
They're running around the campfire 

1443
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:37,561
fucking lines in the background.
Oh yeah.

1444
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:38,920
I didn't see that,
but he was in Detroit.

1445
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,210
He was nice enough.
But while he was in that movie,

1446
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:44,890
that ghost in the darkness,
remember that?

1447
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,140
No.
Michael Douglas in him,

1448
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:51,760
the fucking lion hunting in Africa.
They were working on a railroad.

1449
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,760
It was a fucking great movie.
And these two lions teamed up and 

1450
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:56,870
started killing the railroad workers.
You older?

1451
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,500
Yeah.
It's like a,

1452
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:03,960
I want to say like 90 ish.
That really early nineties is prime.

1453
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,330
Oh yeah.
I wouldn't even bat,

1454
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,310
man.
Yeah.

1455
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:08,740
It's a great fucking movie.
The ghost in the darkness.

1456
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:11,050
Him and Michael Douglas.
Michael Douglas.

1457
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:14,120
Before he got cancer from eating pussy.
I mean those days.

1458
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,030
I don't know,
for me posts.

1459
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,800
He's the only guy in the world that I 
know of.

1460
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,660
Look,
everybody's got to be a first.

1461
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,590
Yeah,
there it is.

1462
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:26,620
That's the ghost in the darkness.
When he played the top gun.

1463
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:28,550
Oh yeah,
Yup.

1464
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,930
Yup.
Same era.

1465
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,800
Same time.
Yeah.

1466
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,950
I think that guy got too much pussy,
lost his fucking mind.

1467
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:36,320
Decided to try to eat themselves to 
death and it just didn't work out.

1468
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:41,321
And then he stayed alive and had a loose
coming back down and have him on this 

1469
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:41,540
love to.

1470
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:44,350
I'm sure you'd love to what I imagined 
he wouldn't.

1471
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:47,930
Why wouldn't he have booze everywhere?
I would just say let's just do this.

1472
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:48,560
Come on,
let's start.

1473
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:50,060
You know what?
I think he did one of those,

1474
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,890
he did one of those autograph shows,
autograph autograph shows.

1475
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:59,891
They have like a,
like chiller theatre and the Hollywood 

1476
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:00,170
show,
whether you sell your autographs.

1477
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:04,150
And I think he did one and he made like 
$100.

1478
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:06,890
A friend of mine told me,
made like 100 grand like he had the line

1479
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:08,060
was,
you know,

1480
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,220
so he just sat down and signed,
sit down and sign.

1481
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,900
That's what know,
you've heard of these things.

1482
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,350
I'm sure you've been offered that.
That never gets to me,

1483
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,390
you know?
Oh,

1484
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,130
I'll probably gets deflected.
But uh,

1485
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:24,170
they,
they just had one that had one in 

1486
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:24,170
jersey,
you know,

1487
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:24,620
where they had like Erik Estrada,
the other guy from chips,

1488
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,550
the other guy,
you know,

1489
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:27,670
all good times,
you know,

1490
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,600
they have the cash.

1491
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,590
Then you know,
this guys from my show have done it.

1492
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,300
I don't want to do it.
I've never done it.

1493
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,160
I personally feel it takes a little 
piece of your soul when they walk by you

1494
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:38,270
and go,
Oh,

1495
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,750
do I want to buy Eddy munsters Pitsa oh,
bobby Bacala.

1496
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,670
Alright,
I'll go with Eddie.

1497
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,900
I think that takes you fucking sole job.
It's gotTa.

1498
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,170
It's gotTa.
Take a chunk of it.

1499
01:00:48,171 --> 01:00:48,830
Come on.
Well,

1500
01:00:48,831 --> 01:00:52,850
I just also think that making people pay
for a signature is fucking crazy,

1501
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,530
but I'm with you.
I do get admitted.

1502
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,000
It's a little annoying when you run into
those guys to the airport and you got to

1503
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:03,001
stack a shit.
They want you to sign 10 of them and 

1504
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:04,260
sell them.
That's not a fan of doing this.

1505
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:08,630
Selling him or this.
They're wholesaling to another guy,

1506
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:13,631
you know,
they just up the ladder like maybe it 

1507
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:13,631
maybe he says,
alright Rogan's going to be there.

1508
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:18,460
I'll give you a $10 from time.
I'll just sign one and this one guy was 

1509
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:18,460
giving me a hard time.
I go,

1510
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,040
dude,
I'm not working for you.

1511
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:20,900
Do you understand?
I'm working with because he's like,

1512
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:22,540
I took a train here.
I go,

1513
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,080
I don't give a fuck.
I didn't ask you.

1514
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:29,110
The only thing is for me,
sometimes it's easy to just sign the 

1515
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:32,861
phone station side of things and move 
on.

1516
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:33,990
Well,
you know,

1517
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,520
I mean you could do it real quick,
but the whole idea behind it is weird.

1518
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:39,530
He's like getting you to do something.
Then he's going to sell it.

1519
01:01:39,531 --> 01:01:41,300
Then they're going to put it on Ebay.
Well,

1520
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:46,390
they all have the same standard stuff.
They have a microphone and want you to 

1521
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:46,620
sell.
Some of them have an MMA glove they want

1522
01:01:46,621 --> 01:01:50,750
or they want you to sign a MMA glove.
They want you to sign pictures,

1523
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,850
pictures,
pictures,

1524
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:53,310
and I go,
wait,

1525
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,680
you get that?
I don't even have the.

1526
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:57,350
They get,
well,

1527
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,630
they get them and then they know where 
you're going to be a little glove,

1528
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:01,250
what your signature.
That would be worth something.

1529
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:06,230
I guess like five bucks maybe probably 
cost you more in gas to get the picture.

1530
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,280
I ran into a fucking guy once that had 
fake shit.

1531
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,980
A guy emailed me and he said,
Hey,

1532
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:17,981
is this your signature?
And I was at a news radio script with 

1533
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:18,410
all the cast members.
I go,

1534
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:20,190
not only that,
I'm not my script.

1535
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,260
All those scripts,
all those signatures are fake.

1536
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,930
All Andy Dicks,
because I knew Andy Signature.

1537
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:28,140
He had a very distinct signature and 
Phil Hartman had a very clean,

1538
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:29,340
distinct signature.
I'm like,

1539
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:30,440
these are all fake.
Yeah,

1540
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:34,920
I still have one.
We did this poster from Cigar Aficionado

1541
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:37,620
magazine that was floating around.
We all sign them,

1542
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:42,650
you know,
we used to sign a lot of stuff at the 

1543
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:42,650
end of the read throughs for the 
Sopranos.

1544
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:46,760
They would have a stack of stuff for 
charity and whatever to sign and it's 

1545
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:50,670
hanging in a restaurant in New York on 
56th avenue.

1546
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:52,980
It's not my signature.
Whoa is hanging up.

1547
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:53,880
It's,
it's,

1548
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:55,380
you know,
like seven of us,

1549
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,800
but it's not my signature.
How crazy is that?

1550
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,840
Someone's going to fake the hanging up 
in a nice restaurant.

1551
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:05,841
Bobby buck a lot with the fat stomach 
because it's from the days when they 

1552
01:03:05,841 --> 01:03:06,570
were the fat stone.
Oh,

1553
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:10,170
they made you put like a prosthesis.
Then I got fat enough on mine.

1554
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,450
Did you get fat enough?
Just so you have to wear that thing.

1555
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:16,760
Oh,
what did they chase?

1556
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,440
You know,
I,

1557
01:03:17,441 --> 01:03:18,480
I,
you know,

1558
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:23,481
when I first got the role I was seeing 
all these jokes like you have cows on 

1559
01:03:23,481 --> 01:03:24,630
with legs and you fat,
fuck,

1560
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:25,650
and you think,
and I'm going,

1561
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:31,070
I'm not that much fatter than getting 
the Fini I'm starting to think that 

1562
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:32,400
maybe they kiss the wrong guy.
I'm not joking.

1563
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:34,830
I'm saying it could be.
I mean,

1564
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:36,730
did you jokes don't make sense.
And then they call,

1565
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:40,650
oh you got to come in for a fat suit.
So I was ridiculous thing.

1566
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:45,890
Then the second year they made it like a
really nice one that was like a costume 

1567
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:51,171
shop.
It had like tits and a costume shop in 

1568
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:53,700
like a Broadway costume thing.
And uh,

1569
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:59,060
and then one year I was going back and I
was at a fitting for the fourth year,

1570
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:00,570
you know,
like the next year.

1571
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:05,570
And uh,
he looked at me and he went and you 

1572
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:05,570
don't have to wait at anymore.
I said,

1573
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:09,611
all right.
So I'm assuming it was pretty 

1574
01:04:09,611 --> 01:04:10,800
embarrassing at first I was prancing 
around there.

1575
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:15,810
They had an ass on me til like a big ass
fake ass and he was gone too big and I 

1576
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:18,110
was like going walking back and forth 
like crazy.

1577
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:23,020
It's fucking,
you will eat Steve Landesberg.

1578
01:04:23,021 --> 01:04:26,880
Remember the comment he said to me,
did they ask your permission to do that?

1579
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:27,540
And I said,
no,

1580
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,050
Steve,
he's,

1581
01:04:28,051 --> 01:04:29,490
I want him to fuck that.
I want.

1582
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:30,990
Well I want to get the job.
You know,

1583
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:34,770
that was a weird time when the sopranos 
came out because all of the sudden there

1584
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:38,910
was like a lot of fake mob guys.
A lot of fake connected,

1585
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:40,740
fake Italian.
You know what I mean?

1586
01:04:40,741 --> 01:04:43,350
It's still around.
I call a Gig Guinea Act guilt,

1587
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,350
but you know what I mean?

1588
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:50,580
It's like that acting that way became in
fashion.

1589
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:55,910
Take started it.
They used to hang around wherever we 

1590
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:55,910
weren't.
They were around,

1591
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:58,020
they were extras.
They was still around,

1592
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:59,340
but there was,
you know,

1593
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:02,760
we did a appearance in the casino.
We do a lot of that stuff.

1594
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:04,560
You know,
they were everywhere.

1595
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,050
They were everywhere.
They were hoping to get on the show.

1596
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,960
He come out and you did the shotgun.
I could do the show.

1597
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:15,980
I remember Michael Imperioli one time.
We were up in Reno and there was one of 

1598
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:19,480
them and he was playing blackjack and 
you know,

1599
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:20,670
and uh,
he except come on,

1600
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,330
put me on the show.
I could tell you though,

1601
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:27,331
I had just went off on him.
I've been trying for 20 years and you 

1602
01:05:27,331 --> 01:05:27,331
know,
blah,

1603
01:05:27,331 --> 01:05:29,280
blah blah.
Then he got he,

1604
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,740
he hit Michael and Michael was right.
He got really pissed off.

1605
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,960
This is just one of those fucking 
Goombas,

1606
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:36,270
you know,
and the guy I could door.

1607
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:39,630
You do the worst.
Exactly.

1608
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,760
This like this wannabes,
but there's something about Guinea 

1609
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:44,760
wannabes.
This allows,

1610
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,290
is a handful out here.
Yeah.

1611
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,950
Oh yeah.
That's the thing here.

1612
01:05:48,951 --> 01:05:53,951
They congregate together when they try 
to like up together.

1613
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:56,750
What's the last thing?
Rogan.

1614
01:05:56,751 --> 01:05:58,300
How come you got Rogan?
What's the book?

1615
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:02,460
I kind of tried to navigate away from 
that.

1616
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:04,680
Even in New York,
I kinda,

1617
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:08,470
it's not my thing.
And Soprano's was so good that it almost

1618
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:10,650
killed the mom genre.
You know?

1619
01:06:10,651 --> 01:06:15,651
I think so.
I think you're right about that because 

1620
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:15,651
you know what,
unless,

1621
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:15,940
and I get a lot of scripts,
Joe,

1622
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,740
in all of that crap,
you know,

1623
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:20,260
they make these,
I call them back yard movies,

1624
01:06:20,261 --> 01:06:21,940
you know,
you're never going to see him,

1625
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:23,470
you know,
whatever they're getting paid.

1626
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,720
I'm not interested because it's that 
same thing.

1627
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:28,440
I'll fuck you up.
You know,

1628
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,110
I am,
you know,

1629
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:33,070
my uncle is like a [inaudible] sketch,
but it's true.

1630
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:37,660
But they write this and I say how people
give them the money.

1631
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:39,790
How do you get the money to make these 
movies?

1632
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:44,910
Well,
I think for awhile people were making 

1633
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:44,910
them just because it's Pr Sopranos was 
so pocket,

1634
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:48,411
but now,
unless you're going to beat Sopranos 

1635
01:06:48,411 --> 01:06:48,411
Goodfellas,
you know,

1636
01:06:48,411 --> 01:06:50,700
what's the great mob movies?
Supra,

1637
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,980
Sopranos,
Goodfellas Casino,

1638
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,360
a raging bull head Marbella elements,
right?

1639
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,770
Great movie.
Uh,

1640
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:02,320
one of my mission there was to be a few 
of them,

1641
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,880
you know,
some great,

1642
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,470
great,
great mob movies.

1643
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:08,440
But right now it was after the Sopranos.
I mean,

1644
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:12,910
you don't see the Godfather Godfather to
know that there was some,

1645
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,030
but you're gonna have to beat that.
Then they tried,

1646
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:20,130
they tried to do some mobby stuff,
ray Donovan's work,

1647
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:20,860
and that's a good chill.

1648
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,890
That's a good show.
When that's from an Irish perspective.

1649
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,920
Yeah.
Well I think what happened with those 

1650
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:28,920
movies was,
or,

1651
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:28,920
or uh,
that show rather is,

1652
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,620
it was those,
you had a movie every week.

1653
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,740
Exactly.
So like every subject was covered.

1654
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:38,560
Betrayaled gambling.
It was funny.

1655
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,090
It was funny,
funny,

1656
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,280
funny elements.
It was very smart.

1657
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,480
That was something,
you know,

1658
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:45,370
I would go,
I would be around and people go,

1659
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:47,260
I don't like that show you on.
I'm Italian.

1660
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,320
Have you ever seen this show?
Have you ever seen the show?

1661
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,280
No,
I haven't seen it.

1662
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:53,270
It's like it's a,
it's just somebody I,

1663
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,580
I don't,
I don't watch porn.

1664
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:55,960
I hate porn.
Have you ever seen it?

1665
01:07:55,961 --> 01:07:57,430
No.
Well then how do you know you don't like

1666
01:07:57,431 --> 01:08:00,040
it?
Or did you see it or do you watch it?

1667
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:02,710
You know what I mean?
But really they're holding signs up.

1668
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,100
I will know porn.
Well,

1669
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,110
that was a big thing,
right?

1670
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:09,250
The Italian American boss society was 
telling you're testing against it.

1671
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:11,230
I bought this story.
I wrote a kids book,

1672
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:13,150
Nikki Deuce,
okay.

1673
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:18,540
Uh,
it took place in Brooklyn and we turned 

1674
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:18,540
it into a movie for Nickelodeon,
you know,

1675
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:23,041
which we didn't just want to get in the 
phoenix slash movies and I had Michael 

1676
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:24,800
Imperioli in it and so rico and uh,
uh,

1677
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:28,370
and Nickelodeon made the movie,
but when I was,

1678
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,330
when I wrote the book,
I was doing book signings and you know,

1679
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,640
it's about a kid fish out of water who 
goes back to Brooklyn and grew up in the

1680
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:38,440
suburbs and he winds up with a kid,
entire neighborhood,

1681
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,470
Bensonhurst,
Brooklyn,

1682
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:42,890
and then it gets into some mischief.
I don't even call it trouble,

1683
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:47,891
but so is guy kept writing letters and 
shit and killing me on the Internet and 

1684
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,370
writing letters to the bookstores.

1685
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,590
A head of me getting there,
you know,

1686
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:59,591
like saying that he's a derogatory 
against Italians and he's now he's 

1687
01:08:59,591 --> 01:09:00,410
bringing kids into it and blah blah,
blah,

1688
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:05,411
blah blah.
So finally I get the guy's number and I 

1689
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,160
called the guy.
I swear to you,

1690
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,810
I say to him,
listen,

1691
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,850
I think his name is Zane.
I think his name is anthony.

1692
01:09:10,851 --> 01:09:11,330
I said,
listen,

1693
01:09:11,331 --> 01:09:11,780
Anthony,
blah,

1694
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:12,030
blah,
blah,

1695
01:09:12,031 --> 01:09:12,650
blah,
blah.

1696
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:17,060
This is the world I know,
like rappers rap about what they know.

1697
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,720
This is what I know,
you know,

1698
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,790
and uh,
he said to me,

1699
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,350
I said,
you know,

1700
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,720
what can I do?
Tell me what I can do.

1701
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:27,920
Let's fix this.
I mean,

1702
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:28,700
because,
you know,

1703
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,190
blah,
blah,

1704
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:29,560
blah,
blah,

1705
01:09:29,561 --> 01:09:30,290
blah.
He said,

1706
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:35,291
well,
you can make a donation to my 

1707
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:35,300
organization.
It was the Italian American bullshit.

1708
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,730
I said,
you got to be kidding me.

1709
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:41,800
100 true story me down.
There's a whole bunch of,

1710
01:09:43,691 --> 01:09:48,691
when the movie came out,
we got some heat for the Nicky deuce 

1711
01:09:48,691 --> 01:09:48,691
movie.
Really?

1712
01:09:48,691 --> 01:09:51,550
And it's not really about mob,
it's just want attention.

1713
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,910
I mean,
exactly.

1714
01:09:52,911 --> 01:09:57,911
You know,
and they did that with this problem of 

1715
01:09:57,911 --> 01:09:57,911
people would say all the time,
you know,

1716
01:09:57,911 --> 01:09:57,911
Joe,
uh,

1717
01:09:57,911 --> 01:10:02,610
yeah,
I don't want you to thing I'm an 

1718
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:02,610
Italian.
You guys talked bad about a time.

1719
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:02,610
You know,
they didn't,

1720
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:02,820
they,
they,

1721
01:10:02,821 --> 01:10:06,490
they showed what really was.
I thought it was very authentic,

1722
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,400
you know,
oh,

1723
01:10:07,401 --> 01:10:09,800
well,
this apprentice is authentic as it gets.

1724
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:12,020
If you know anybody like that,
you know those people exist.

1725
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:13,460
Absolutely.
And I take a 10.

1726
01:10:13,461 --> 01:10:15,010
They don't exist.
Is it fencing?

1727
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:20,011
Exactly.
And I think it was a story that need to 

1728
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:20,011
be told.

1729
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:24,540
This is what it is,
but it was such a fascinating show 

1730
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,450
because Gandolfini was a bad guy,
like his character.

1731
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:31,770
You're rooted for a bad guy,
a murder for a murderer who cheated on 

1732
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:32,720
his wife,
stole rob,

1733
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:35,840
shook people down,
but he was your guy.

1734
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,550
He was,
I think the first.

1735
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:43,120
I think I could be wrong.
The first like anti hero that people 

1736
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,180
were deformed.
I think you're right.

1737
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:46,400
I,
I can't imagine that it was,

1738
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:47,200
you know,
your,

1739
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,650
your roof for the guy,
you know,

1740
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,910
he was a real anti hero.
No murderer,

1741
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:54,020
a con man.
I mean all the above.

1742
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:59,670
They,
they didn't just do it to people in the 

1743
01:10:59,670 --> 01:10:59,670
mob.
They did it to people,

1744
01:10:59,670 --> 01:10:59,670
you know,
like on the show.

1745
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:03,560
There wasn't just within each other.
They went outside,

1746
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:06,170
they were robbing people,
busting up,

1747
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,420
uh,
uh,

1748
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:09,740
you know,
businesses and doing all this stuff that

1749
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:10,710
they do.
Yeah,

1750
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,000
it was great.
It was,

1751
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:17,610
it was a very smart show and if it,
if they put it back on now,

1752
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,670
they would get higher ratings than some 
of their shows now.

1753
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,750
I bet.
I bet they would.

1754
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,830
Well,
it was so good.

1755
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:26,100
I think a lot of people forgot how good 
it was and it also changed a lot.

1756
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,010
If you go to the first episode,
the first episode was essentially like a

1757
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:31,170
slapstick comedy.
You remember that?

1758
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,950
I'm not in the rain.
Brought out with the rain.

1759
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,560
Brocco a who was the woman that played 
his wife,

1760
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:42,561
ed.
Ed Falco had a fucking machine gun and 

1761
01:11:42,561 --> 01:11:46,320
the doctor was trying to outside with a 
machine gun.

1762
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,590
It was way more slapsticky.
It was weird.

1763
01:11:49,591 --> 01:11:50,380
It was like a thing.

1764
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:55,430
Well,
they shot the show aired in [inaudible] 

1765
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:56,020
99,
right.

1766
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,160
I think they shot that in [inaudible] 
98,

1767
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,860
if I'm not mistaken.
Really,

1768
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:04,020
if I'm not mistaken at 98,
I believe.

1769
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,190
[inaudible] 97.
Even.

1770
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:10,191
They'd go back and then it took six 
months and then they started shooting 

1771
01:12:10,191 --> 01:12:11,520
them.
You know how how David Chase did it?

1772
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:16,610
He didn't do it like a regular show 
where you shoot it and then in three 

1773
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:19,690
weeks it's on the air,
you know,

1774
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:24,910
he put them all in the camp.
They were finished and locked and you 

1775
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:25,080
know,
you know what I mean,

1776
01:12:25,081 --> 01:12:25,620
like,
you know,

1777
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:27,510
you finished your,
your whatever.

1778
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:32,660
It took nine months and then he edited 
them and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.

1779
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,130
And then they aired,
you know,

1780
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:37,650
it was done a completely different way.
You also,

1781
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,940
they would,
uh,

1782
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,020
they would,
you know,

1783
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:46,210
if they didn't like what you did,
I mean he replaced you and you never 

1784
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:46,210
even knew it.
Really?

1785
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:47,190
Yeah.
He replaced,

1786
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:47,880
you know,
like,

1787
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:48,350
uh,
I,

1788
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,450
I had a scene with a guy and they called
back,

1789
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,970
you know,
a month or so later and said,

1790
01:12:52,971 --> 01:12:57,971
you've got to shoot the scene together 
with a different actor for whatever 

1791
01:12:57,971 --> 01:13:01,161
reason,
whether you know the guy didn't do a 

1792
01:13:01,161 --> 01:13:03,621
good job or a,
he looked too young or too old or just 

1793
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:04,440
didn't fit.
He had the,

1794
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,140
he had the capacity to just shoot it 
again if it,

1795
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,440
if it,
it didn't work.

1796
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:15,470
He rewrite the scene.
You shoot the scene again three months 

1797
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:15,470
later.

1798
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,820
What's interesting about those kinds of 
shows too,

1799
01:13:16,821 --> 01:13:20,270
is that they're so big and so popular 
that you become that character.

1800
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,490
Whoever that character is,
you become that guy.

1801
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,540
You're that guy forever.

1802
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,940
That's of course.
I mean that,

1803
01:13:24,941 --> 01:13:26,590
and that's part of the deal.
That's okay.

1804
01:13:26,591 --> 01:13:28,680
I had no Korea before that,
so it's not.

1805
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:28,860
Yeah.

1806
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:34,010
I'm not saying with you what I'm saying,
like there's some people that you've 

1807
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:34,680
worked since then you'll continue to 
work,

1808
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:39,890
but there's some people that were on 
that show that we're really famous when 

1809
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:39,890
that show was on the air

1810
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:40,480
and the vanished.
Yeah,

1811
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:41,090
yeah,
yeah.

1812
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,470
Well,
you're in the,

1813
01:13:42,471 --> 01:13:47,471
you know,
you got people all over the world 

1814
01:13:47,471 --> 01:13:47,471
watching.
I mean,

1815
01:13:47,471 --> 01:13:50,991
I've been stopped with people literally 
from all over the world that have 

1816
01:13:50,991 --> 01:13:51,900
watched a show.
It was like a cult hit,

1817
01:13:51,901 --> 01:13:54,160
like nothing that ever hit before,
like big pussies,

1818
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,870
big pussy for the rest of his fucking 
ass.

1819
01:13:56,730 --> 01:14:00,150
Vinnie's also.
He embraces that too.

1820
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:04,200
You know what I mean?
Embraces that for him and works and he's

1821
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:05,040
okay.
He works.

1822
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,110
He does his thing,
you know,

1823
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,640
he's always going to work.
He's a very good actor.

1824
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,440
He's got his music,
he's a musician and stuff,

1825
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:11,540
but I hear,
you know,

1826
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,330
especially the name,
big pussy.

1827
01:14:13,331 --> 01:14:15,460
That was a big thing.
People like to say that.

1828
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:16,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

1829
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,980
They do like to say that,
but also his,

1830
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:23,120
you know,
the scene in the movie when they kill 

1831
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:23,120
him,
like the whole,

1832
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:23,120
the whole way it plays out.

1833
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,400
It was very intense.
It was like,

1834
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:26,200
Whoa,
I can't believe they killed big pussy.

1835
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,400
Well,
if that was the big thing,

1836
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:32,770
that was the first time to have regular 
cast member gets killed.

1837
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:34,150
Yeah.
I mean they're not killing the,

1838
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:35,140
you know,
uh,

1839
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:37,150
the guy from friends.
Exactly.

1840
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,160
David Schwimmer and getting killed,
you know.

1841
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:41,410
Oh,
one know one Friday night,

1842
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:42,640
oh my God,
they killed David.

1843
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:43,920
Tremendous.
Five friends now,

1844
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:49,080
you know.
So that was a big character that gets 

1845
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,020
killed and then big characters kept 
getting killed,

1846
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:52,630
which is why guys will worry.
I mean,

1847
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:57,700
there was a real concern that you 
weren't going to get killed off the 

1848
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,390
show.
The more material they gave you,

1849
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:02,080
the more of shot you're getting killed.
Yeah.

1850
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,520
Yeah.
I mean,

1851
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,040
you know,
and,

1852
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,980
and let's not kid ourselves.
It's not just,

1853
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,180
you know,
you're out of work.

1854
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:08,230
They just put you out of work.

1855
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,880
And the biggest show that Glenn,
when Gandolfini killed Imperioli,

1856
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:14,140
I was like,
Whoa,

1857
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:16,980
Holy Shit.
Pinched his nose.

1858
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,460
I'm like,
what?

1859
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:19,240
But,
but you know what,

1860
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,540
once you made it into the last season,
it was like a,

1861
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:25,020
listen,
you done,

1862
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:26,950
you're paid.
However the story ends.

1863
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,410
It's probably better if I would have got
killed early on,

1864
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:31,240
I would have felt really shitty.
I'll tell you.

1865
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,730
And so all the stuff that happened 
because you know.

1866
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:35,170
Right.
You know what I mean?

1867
01:15:35,171 --> 01:15:36,490
And plus,
you know,

1868
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:40,270
we didn't mention we started making 
money towards the middle and the end,

1869
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:45,330
you know,
not the guys at the beginning while 

1870
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:46,960
making money.
Well those shows are hard to make money 

1871
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,510
like HBO is.
They don't worry,

1872
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:53,520
you know,
Hbo Pace and they pay now even better 

1873
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:53,520
than the shows off the end.
Nine years.

1874
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:54,810
Wow.
Now,

1875
01:15:54,811 --> 01:15:55,630
you know,
we went into,

1876
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:57,670
you know,
and then there was other money coming in

1877
01:15:57,671 --> 01:15:59,710
because he had opportunities to do other
shit,

1878
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,100
you know?

1879
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:05,160
Well that show was also groundbreaking 
in that it was one of the first shows 

1880
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,690
like that and now hbo specializes in 
those kinds of shows and emc.

1881
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:11,360
And so this show time.
Yup,

1882
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,780
Yup.
That all kind of know in the Sopranos.

1883
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:15,640
First time they,
they're hiring a,

1884
01:16:15,641 --> 01:16:17,770
you know,
a fat bald guy,

1885
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,160
you know,
wasn't a leading man they wanted,

1886
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:23,580
you know,
you figure he's the good looking guy,

1887
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:28,590
you know what I mean?
But he was intense and charismatic and 

1888
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:32,410
one of the girls,
the girls loved them and we used to 

1889
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:32,410
joke,
you know,

1890
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:35,220
they say TV puts 10 pounds on the.
I say it takes 50 off.

1891
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:35,870
Yeah.

1892
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:41,470
Well he was just such an interesting 
character.

1893
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:45,130
He was so intense and like when he got 
into that murderous rage,

1894
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,380
like you fucking bought it,
hook,

1895
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:49,360
line and sinker.
When you acted with him,

1896
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:50,440
you didn't have to,
uh,

1897
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,210
you know,
get enough to act scared.

1898
01:16:52,211 --> 01:16:54,010
Like if it was a scene,
I got to be scared.

1899
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:54,960
You're going to yell at me,
you know,

1900
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,830
it was fucking,
you know,

1901
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,530
he gave you the whole thing.
You know,

1902
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,850
we had that fight,
you know,

1903
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:03,110
me and him had that fight in the first 
episode that,

1904
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:04,060
you know what I mean?
You know,

1905
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,700
we shot that for a day and a half.
Well,

1906
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,470
that was tough.
He was choking me.

1907
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,640
He said,
listen,

1908
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:14,660
you know,
let's try to take this as far as we can 

1909
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,900
and we and turn it.
I was pulling his hair.

1910
01:17:15,901 --> 01:17:19,010
He was fucking choking me that I was 
getting cut from the.

1911
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,530
I was wearing a necklace,
you know,

1912
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,380
I was getting cut from that.
I mean we've all banged up,

1913
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,170
banged up for real and that's why I look
real.

1914
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:31,410
It was like two fat out of shape guys.
Find the fuck out.

1915
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,040
Don't you know guys,
it's not Steven Seagal.

1916
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,050
Well,
you know what I mean,

1917
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,220
you're,
you're,

1918
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,540
you know what the hell.
This was like a fight.

1919
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,900
So when you do something like that,
like how hard you hit each other,

1920
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:47,380
you know,
as hard as you could without really 

1921
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:47,380
hurting.
And he had said that.

1922
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,410
Let's go as far as we could and we were,
you know,

1923
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:54,610
pull my head,
poke my head fucking of and choking me.

1924
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,270
I had to go further,
you know,

1925
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,810
like I said,
we were good friends,

1926
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:05,370
you know,
if you do it with a stranger you could 

1927
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:05,370
get a little funky,
you know what I mean?

1928
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:05,370
Like,
Hey,

1929
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:05,700
well,
you know,

1930
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:10,720
you know,
I had a fight scene it if he wants to 

1931
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:10,720
accidentally punched the guy in the 
face,

1932
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,550
um,
I meant to miss his face but he threw a 

1933
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:17,021
drink in my face and I was supposed to 
punch him but I was supposed to like 

1934
01:18:17,021 --> 01:18:17,021
punch him.
I hit him right in the jaw and he got to

1935
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,650
go down.
But he was like,

1936
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,110
but I didn't,
I didn't hit him hard,

1937
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:22,760
but I hit him,
you know,

1938
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:24,890
and like you see the look in his face 
like you weren't supposed to hit me.

1939
01:18:24,891 --> 01:18:26,030
Like keep,
just keep going.

1940
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:27,000
Yeah.
You know,

1941
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,540
I had apologized and it was,
was he okay?

1942
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:30,230
Yeah,
he was okay.

1943
01:18:30,231 --> 01:18:31,690
But you could see,
as you know,

1944
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,350
when someone,
especially if you're not used to getting

1945
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:35,390
hit on the jaw and you see that,
that dunk,

1946
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:40,220
this shock and the sparks,
but fight scenes like that,

1947
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:42,980
like you're fighting with Gandel Fini or
you know,

1948
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,860
some movies that you watch people punch 
each other and kick each other.

1949
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,950
Like that guy just hit that guy like 
that sometimes.

1950
01:18:48,951 --> 01:18:49,760
You know.
And look,

1951
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:54,761
I think it's,
I know it was listened to guys on the 

1952
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:54,800
show.
He smacked me,

1953
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,840
really smacked me.
She's,

1954
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:57,890
you know,
they want that,

1955
01:18:57,891 --> 01:18:59,030
you know,
hit me,

1956
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:04,040
you know,
I've seen that on a lot of stuff that 

1957
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:04,040
I've done.
And then some guys don't want no part of

1958
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:04,550
it.
No Way.

1959
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:07,100
No how but good smack me,
you know,

1960
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,250
get the makeup girl and covered smack me
again.

1961
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,920
You want that real reaction?
Yeah.

1962
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,660
Eating on it.
I'm a big believer in eating,

1963
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,540
you know,
I know you get sick of eating,

1964
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:20,240
but that's the elite,
that fucking,

1965
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:24,080
you know,
to show the movie and just keep bringing

1966
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:25,380
stakes out.
Bring it out.

1967
01:19:25,381 --> 01:19:30,381
I'll just keep being not,
not because I have a glove because they 

1968
01:19:30,381 --> 01:19:31,900
think it looks real.
The by,

1969
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
you know,
if you noticed I'm a little cookie so I 

1970
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,000
noticed shit like that.

1971
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,530
It looked.
They didn't really know.

1972
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:42,780
Yeah.
Well that's the worst is when you see 

1973
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,610
someone who's eating a half eaten steak 
and the next quarter eaten steak because

1974
01:19:44,611 --> 01:19:47,420
you know what the record is eating.
Would you put steak back?

1975
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,650
You know,
what's the worst thing?

1976
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,050
I don't smoke and I've never smoked 
cigarettes.

1977
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:51,920
You know?
Uh,

1978
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,700
you see people smoking on TV and they 
can't smoke.

1979
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,170
Well they don't know what they're doing.
I know.

1980
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,850
Exactly.
I wouldn't know.

1981
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,100
I don't know how.
I mean,

1982
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,820
what,
what is the deal?

1983
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:05,090
We don't know.
You don't smoke cigarettes?

1984
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:06,980
No.
But what would be the difference?

1985
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:07,900
Is

1986
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:11,130
a thing.
And do you smoke?

1987
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,320
I think it's a casual thing.
You know,

1988
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:18,370
it's like you,
you like how comfortable are you with 

1989
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:18,370
it?
I know,

1990
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:18,370
but you see people that aren't,
you know,

1991
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:20,670
like I've been asked.
I said I'll smoke a cigar,

1992
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:25,671
which I don't even do that.
But I see cigar seems like so unusual 

1993
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,770
that anybody could do it.
Yeah,

1994
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:28,310
yeah.
No,

1995
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,480
it's a cigarette.
You see people,

1996
01:20:29,481 --> 01:20:30,820
you got the sketch,
not a smoker.

1997
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:33,240
No cigarette smokers do get crazy about 
that.

1998
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:38,270
Well,
there's certain things like here's the 

1999
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:38,270
one that drives everybody the most nuts.
That's a musician.

2000
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:39,570
When you see someone fake playing a 
guitar,

2001
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:44,630
like someone's really jamming out and he
know they're not really hitting any of 

2002
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,511
the notes.
Like what is he don't even show his 

2003
01:20:47,511 --> 01:20:47,511
fingers.
You fuck.

2004
01:20:47,511 --> 01:20:48,660
Stop it.
Or guys trying to cook or something.

2005
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:50,380
You know,
this thing's gotta.

2006
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:55,420
You gotta do your homework.
I would imagine to guitar one would 

2007
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:58,491
probably be like the worst because 
there's so many complicated movements 

2008
01:20:58,491 --> 01:20:59,640
and if you're like a person who actually
knows how to play and you watch it,

2009
01:20:59,641 --> 01:21:02,460
you would know that it's fake.
Fighting is that way too though.

2010
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,530
Like you watched fight scenes in movies 
when you,

2011
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:06,480
you know,
like a boxing scene,

2012
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:10,380
you know like Mark Walberg,
I think he's a very good actor.

2013
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,140
But that movie the fighter where he 
played micky ward,

2014
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,550
like I'm watching him.
I'm like,

2015
01:21:14,551 --> 01:21:19,551
this is,
this is a guy that's not getting hit 

2016
01:21:19,551 --> 01:21:19,551
like he's boxing,
like no one's hitting them back.

2017
01:21:19,551 --> 01:21:21,280
And when you think about like the rocky 
movies,

2018
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:24,810
terrible with the fight.
Scenes are terrible.

2019
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,340
They're terrible.
They're the worst.

2020
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,780
They're atrocious.
This one movie,

2021
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:32,880
one guy,
but they're great movies as far as like,

2022
01:21:32,881 --> 01:21:37,881
look,
when I was a little kid I saw rocky and 

2023
01:21:37,881 --> 01:21:37,881
I drank a fucking raw egg and I ran 
around the block.

2024
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,750
I never run in my life.
I mean,

2025
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:41,380
unless I was playing baseball or 
something,

2026
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,890
I never ran.
But that movie made me go running.

2027
01:21:43,891 --> 01:21:48,750
I wanted to go running today,
so it wasn't,

2028
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:51,740
it wasn't that they were bad movies,
but when you watch the boxing scene,

2029
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:53,540
he's like,
get the fuck out.

2030
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,930
Well,
the raging bull.

2031
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:55,970
That was good.
That was good.

2032
01:21:56,260 --> 01:22:01,260
That was.
That was Korea choreographed down to 

2033
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:01,260
this.
It was.

2034
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:04,700
Well,
he recreated essentially what happened 

2035
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,630
with sugar ray Robinson and Jake Lamata,
but Deniro was a meticulous motherfucker

2036
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:12,650
in those days.
You mean what it look kind of shape he 

2037
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:13,050
got in for that movie?
Looked like Lamanda.

2038
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:18,260
I mean,
he looked like those days are over 

2039
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,940
meticulous rover now.
He's doing spring break.

2040
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:26,720
No shirt on.
Oh,

2041
01:22:26,721 --> 01:22:28,410
you don't do the best boxing movie 
though?

2042
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,240
Daniel Day Lewis.
He did that movie.

2043
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:35,241
The boxer.
He apparently lived like a boxer for a 

2044
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:35,640
whole year for that move.
Although he does that kind of stuff.

2045
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,770
Yeah.
And you watch him box though,

2046
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:40,640
like he's boxing like a boxer.
He's not boxing.

2047
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,930
It's called the box.
Yeah,

2048
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:48,050
it's called the boxer.
He plays an IRA guy that gets released 

2049
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:48,180
from prison and goes back to boxing.
Oh really?

2050
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,440
That's good.
Very good.

2051
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:50,520
Very good.
He uh,

2052
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:51,480
uh,
my uh,

2053
01:22:51,481 --> 01:22:56,040
buddy of mine was in the Lincoln movie 
and he stayed at Lincoln,

2054
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:58,910
Lincoln Fall.
Any character?

2055
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:04,040
And he was wiggling.
I swear somebody said that he cut his.

2056
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:06,140
He

2057
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,110
sliced his thumb.
Yeah.

2058
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:12,610
And somebody else let there be blood he 
got.

2059
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:16,300
He got annoyed that I'm sure he does.
He stays in character the whole time.

2060
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:18,450
I guess he had a box for,
you know,

2061
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:22,000
to cut that.
What he is above and beyond.

2062
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:24,970
That's the guy that loses him.
Him Christian Bale.

2063
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:28,460
They lose themselves in the characters.
A lot of people play it,

2064
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,400
myself included,
you know,

2065
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:31,870
I'm not going to play an English 
professor,

2066
01:23:31,871 --> 01:23:32,740
you know what I mean?
Joe,

2067
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:34,510
I play a blue collar guy,
you know,

2068
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,760
whatever that is.
But some guys,

2069
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:40,510
and those are two of them,
they just completely disappeared.

2070
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:44,290
Gary Oldman and the Gary Oldman,
especially in the day like Kevin Spacey.

2071
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:48,160
You still also true true romance with 
Gary Oldman played the,

2072
01:23:48,161 --> 01:23:53,161
uh,
the white guy with the dreadlocks scar 

2073
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:53,710
on his face completely.
But those are the four that I really,

2074
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,750
you know,
you know what I mean?

2075
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:58,660
The four guys that you say,
it's a craft,

2076
01:23:58,690 --> 01:23:59,740
you know,
I mean,

2077
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,980
it's that level.
It's a whole different level.

2078
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:08,040
It's a different level.
And then you see a successful actors 

2079
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,780
play literally the same person over and 
old canneries,

2080
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:10,780
which you're saying,
yeah,

2081
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,040
but he's good at it.
I'll tell you,

2082
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:16,150
I said probably the same thing.
Yeah.

2083
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,140
You know,
that and that.

2084
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:18,940
Yeah.
And that's okay.

2085
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:20,940
She's successful in whatever.
Yeah.

2086
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:25,950
Well,
there's a lot of actors when you go to 

2087
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:25,950
see the movie,
even though they're really good,

2088
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:27,100
you want to see them play that 
character,

2089
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:28,720
you know,
like Christopher walken.

2090
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:31,560
I'm looking for him.
I worked for them guys.

2091
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:34,010
I want him to be that guy.
Why don't you be that guy?

2092
01:24:34,011 --> 01:24:36,760
But it's gotten.
Sometimes it's almost a character.

2093
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:38,640
It isn't,
you know,

2094
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:39,700
I did.
Uh,

2095
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:41,260
I,
I've worked with him twice.

2096
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:42,010
He's a good guy.

2097
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:44,290
He's Latino.
Every movie has to have a rent.

2098
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:47,650
There's gotta be some way.
Every movie.

2099
01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:50,610
He's got some crazy rant where he's got 
to go on this rant.

2100
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:55,620
I mean it's,
there was an old letterman clip that I 

2101
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:59,251
saw,
I just saw like yesterday day before 

2102
01:24:59,251 --> 01:25:01,250
Kevin Spacey's doing Pachino to Pachino.
Really look for that.

2103
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,350
It's really funny.
He does.

2104
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,860
The thing is,
it's really funny.

2105
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,660
Kevin Spacey is a bad motherfucker on 
that.

2106
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:09,640
Netflix,
that Netflix show.

2107
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:11,710
No,
I don't think he's very good.

2108
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:13,840
He's already fan.
Yeah,

2109
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:14,290
yeah,
yeah,

2110
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:15,650
yeah.
He lets him.

2111
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:17,710
It's interesting that Netflix is doing 
stuff like that.

2112
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:19,090
They're putting,
they're putting out their own original,

2113
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:21,040
different,
different business model.

2114
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:23,620
They're in a whole different deal,
you know what I mean?

2115
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,440
That's a word.
I don't know how many people watch it on

2116
01:25:26,441 --> 01:25:28,030
watch,
but uh,

2117
01:25:28,031 --> 01:25:29,200
that's a huge.
Whoa,

2118
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:30,400
what the fuck is it called again?

2119
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:33,580
Fucks the Kevin Spacey's.
Thank you.

2120
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:37,300
How can I not remember that?
He doesn't shave.

2121
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:42,690
Talks low sometimes he ever jump in,
jump in if she wants to go.

2122
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,900
He goes,
uh,

2123
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:51,010
but yeah,
I just liked that they can do that now 

2124
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:51,010
they can produce their own content,
you know,

2125
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:51,460
they can do anything.
Listen,

2126
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,280
uh,
it's,

2127
01:25:52,281 --> 01:25:53,560
it's toy.
It's calling.

2128
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:55,940
Have you seen that a bill burr show?
Efforts for family?

2129
01:25:55,941 --> 01:25:57,040
Yeah.
Did bill ever work for,

2130
01:25:57,041 --> 01:25:57,950
you know,
but I,

2131
01:25:57,951 --> 01:25:58,540
I,
you know,

2132
01:25:58,541 --> 01:26:01,460
I hosted a thing at the garden last 
year,

2133
01:26:01,461 --> 01:26:05,970
had gotten into dreams a 5,500
people to kid's charity.

2134
01:26:05,971 --> 01:26:09,320
It's a good one.
And it was bill burr John Oliver,

2135
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:13,280
Lewis Black Dane Cook and billy God 
though.

2136
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,830
And uh,
I met bill.

2137
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:17,540
He's a funny guy.
His Greg Guy,

2138
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:20,510
he's funny and he's a guy.
He's a real good guy.

2139
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:21,920
He's a good guy.
I asked him,

2140
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,300
what you see is what you get.

2141
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:26,000
He's a really funny guy.
I mean,

2142
01:26:26,001 --> 01:26:26,710
uh,
and you know what?

2143
01:26:26,711 --> 01:26:29,240
I seen them on another charity,
the comedy central,

2144
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:34,241
that thing,
and that's the first time I had seen 

2145
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:34,241
him,
but he's been around,

2146
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:34,241
right?
Yeah.

2147
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:34,320
Yeah.
He's uh,

2148
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:35,410
he's a,
he was funny.

2149
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:40,870
Makes me laugh a lot.
There's not that many comics that make 

2150
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:40,870
me laugh.
Laugh.

2151
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:40,870
He's one of the best ever.
He's a Boston guy.

2152
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:41,490
Yeah.
He,

2153
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,190
there's not too many guys,
by the way.

2154
01:26:43,191 --> 01:26:45,770
He breaks a hell of a pie.
A Pie.

2155
01:26:45,771 --> 01:26:47,390
Baker.
It makes Pumpkin Pie.

2156
01:26:47,391 --> 01:26:49,640
It's fucking delicious.
Really good.

2157
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:50,730
He gets into it.
He makes his own.

2158
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,420
Start selling them,
selling them.

2159
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,220
I'm already getting in trouble because 
I'm late.

2160
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:55,790
All right,
brother.

2161
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,520
I ran it.
It was great seeing please anytime.

2162
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:01,560
Whenever you're in town or you hear 
often.

2163
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:02,270
Uh,
no.

2164
01:27:02,271 --> 01:27:03,470
I haven't been because I've been 
working.

2165
01:27:03,471 --> 01:27:05,630
I've been doing the blue bloods was the 
last time you were here?

2166
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,900
It's been about,
I'd say close to a year.

2167
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:11,090
Anytime.
It's a pleasure.

2168
01:27:11,091 --> 01:27:16,091
If I'm in New York,
maybe I need to go to New York and just 

2169
01:27:16,091 --> 01:27:16,610
set up shop there in New York.
A bunch of podcasts down there.

2170
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:18,710
That would be good.
It would be a bunch of guys.

2171
01:27:18,711 --> 01:27:20,810
So how do people get your sauce?
