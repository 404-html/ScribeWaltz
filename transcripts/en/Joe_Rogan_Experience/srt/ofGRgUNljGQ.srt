Cause it's just so interest

7
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,940
starting to approach or the approach to
combat and everyday life should be the

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,030

11
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:19,290
that that's a approach to combat and
everyday life should be the same.

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,050
That's,

13
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,701

14
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:20,970
Yeah.

15
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,200
It's always a little too intense.

16
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,200
I have a real interesting
one on my Instagram.

17
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,700
I don't know if you can pull it up.

18
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,680
Is that the guy who touched
the girl for the first time?

19
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,514
That video?

20
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,000
No,

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,630
but uh,

22
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,463
it is a lady,

23
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,480

24
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,360

Yeah.

29
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,420
Who is that guy that touched the girl?

30
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:41,421
Did you get permission to put them on
your part to try to take down that one

31
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,320

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,221
Isn't that,

34
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,240
that one's pretty interesting.

35
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,440
The one where the girl,

36
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,610

42
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,953

43
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,240

47
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,050

49
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:10,610
you're both fucking hilarious.

50
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,000
She is.

51
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,070
But you guys are closed.

52
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,550
So specific.

53
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,030
Yeah.

54
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,750
You have the,

55
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,100
you guys have the funniest,

56
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:19,460
silliest fucking show because
you're both so specific.

57
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,831
Thanks.

58
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah,

59
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,341
like the,

60
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,960
the things that you just decide,

61
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:22,701
like you wearing a shirt.

62
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:25,010
Tom's wearing a shirt that
says just glass and on it,

63
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,871
I'm just glass and Brown.

64
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:29,300
Now glass in is a term that like hunters
use when they get up on a ridge and

65
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:30,170
they look for things.

66
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,341
Yeah.

67
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,460
So when I saw that I was like,

68
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:32,031
well that's weird.

69
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:32,780
Like what did you,

70
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,470
maybe you bought that convenience
store when you were in Alaska,

71
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:36,940
right?

72
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,640
Something like that.

73
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:37,881
Yeah.

74
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,730
This would be a silly
gimmicky shirt today,

75
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,131
but no,

76
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:42,230
this is a shirt like from
your fucking podcast.

77
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,621
It is,

78
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:43,020
yeah.

79
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,090
It's top tells the story.

80
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,790
Every week a week

81
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,790
we get submitted hundreds of emails
with links to videos like that.

82
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,110
Right,

83
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,221
right,

84
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:54,500
right.

85
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,890
I mean,

86
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,150
so many emails.

87
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:56,631
Have you seen this?

88
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:57,230
Have you seen the,

89
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,501
and the,

90
00:01:57,501 --> 00:02:00,560
and the Internet is endless
pool of stuff to pull from.

91
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,940
And then we have this,

92
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
our producer blue band,

93
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,070
I don't know if you know that.

94
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
That's our producer's name.

95
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,320
Bam.

96
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,531
Yeah.

97
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:08,090
Cause it used to be red band.

98
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,370
He was a yellow band for awhile
and now there's blue van,

99
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,263
so,

100
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,560
so blue band.

101
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,160
Um,

102
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,550
then we'll go through a lot
of this stuff and edit down,

103
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,650
let's say like a five minute
youtube video until like maybe six,

104
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,380
10 to 15 second clips.

105
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,840
And so we're just always
looking at stuff and it's,

106
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:27,230
you know,

107
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,680
the,

108
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,560
we like a range of things are engaging us.

109
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,071
Well,

110
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:32,120
we got this hunter,

111
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,430
his name is Fred Eichler,

112
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:37,020
I think he's an avid bow hunter.

113
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,530
He bumped he oh bonds
with a traditional bow.

114
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
Like a recurve bow is,

115
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,421
that's right.

116
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,860
The one of the most preeminent,

117
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,140
a recurve bow hunters.

118
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:44,390
Yeah.

119
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,000
It's either a recurve bow
or a might be a stick bow.

120
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:47,811
Yeah,

121
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:47,961
no,

122
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:48,121
it's,

123
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:48,954
it's a totally,

124
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,450
it's incredible how
that technology evolved.

125
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:52,710
Yeah.

126
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,750
So there's a lot of these guys,

127
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:55,850
like this guy you were
talking about class and guy,

128
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,640
he still uses like one of
those primitive boasts,

129
00:02:58,641 --> 00:02:59,560
but he's just good.

130
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,370
He can get away with it.

131
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:00,731
It says,

132
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,121
I mean there's,

133
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,350
bio is the incredible,

134
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,780
but in this video it starts with him.

135
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,393
Uh,

136
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,850
he,

137
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,850
he shoots a moose and it drops quick and
he fucking comes close to coming in his

138
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,984
pants.

139
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,003
Like he,

140
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,780
he makes a sound that you don't even,

141
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,410
you can't,

142
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,870
he goes like,

143
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,170
like,

144
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,471
like,

145
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:20,950
like can you show it to us?

146
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,371
Uh,

147
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:22,204
yeah.

148
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,070
Are you allowed to play it online?

149
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,630
Did you get pulled from anything?

150
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:25,870
No.

151
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,520
Play it on Youtube and,

152
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,630
and we also play,

153
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,493
I mean,

154
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,690
the audio is what's incredible,

155
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,990
but then he starts talking
about glassine and he's like,

156
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,520
we were just coming around the meadow.

157
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,330
We were just glass and go.

158
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,071
And then we were like,

159
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:39,550
let's go,

160
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,171
let's go ask.

161
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:40,540
And he gives,

162
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,051
keeps going.

163
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:41,411
Glass,

164
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:41,711
glass,

165
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:42,011
glass,

166
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:42,551
glass and glass,

167
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,320
which is looking through binoculars,

168
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,190
which we discovered,

169
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,650
but then we played it so much.

170
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,731
People like,

171
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,110
I would post a picture of myself,

172
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:52,180
like I'm about to go on and be like,

173
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,014
are you glassing?

174
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,740
And like,

175
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,341
or you know,

176
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,600
like if you talk to somebody like,

177
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,201
what'd you do today?

178
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:56,351
I'm like,

179
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:56,471
oh,

180
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:56,921
I hung out.

181
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,120
And they were like
glassing and you're like,

182
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:58,281
yeah.

183
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,860
So then it morphed into
meaning like just chill.

184
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,700
Yeah.

185
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,440
And I dunno,

186
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,210
it just kind of picked up from there.

187
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,590
So I just have so many of these though.

188
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,700
Okay.

189
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,770
What's the deal with jeans

190
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,920
calling everybody jeans?

191
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,470
Like when you guys were on that
and you had to explain it to me.

192
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,170
Yeah.

193
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,510
You know what the latest
thing is with that?

194
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,190
First we had an electrician over at the
house and whenever you're in the house,

195
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,840
you know you're calling your spouse,

196
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,171
I'd be like,

197
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,010
Jane's do you know,

198
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,910
cause that's what I call her.

199
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,640
So then she walked down
the stairs and he goes,

200
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:28,060
gene,

201
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,230
would you like me to put the,

202
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,180
so he and we just let it go.

203
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,140
We called her jeans,

204
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,611
but then we started,

205
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm going to Starbucks
and ordering our drinks.

206
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,870
It's just like a stupid thing
like that we told our listeners,

207
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:41,290
we do,

208
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,380
we do this regularly
just to amuse ourselves,

209
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:44,711
which is,

210
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:48,760
we'll call them jeans and
then say thank you mommy,

211
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,110
or I love you mommy at the end.

212
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,670
And no one ever,

213
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,790
the order happens so fast and it's so
like programmed that they never catch it.

214
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,291
Never say like,

215
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,124
what did you say?

216
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,153
So like when I,

217
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,480
when I pulled up like,

218
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,350
welcome to Starbucks,

219
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,801
what can I get for you?

220
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:03,634
It'd be like a,

221
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,811
hey jeans,

222
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,910
I want to get an iced coffee,

223
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,560
extra ice and what do you want?

224
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,050
A double tall sort latte.

225
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,391
Okay.

226
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:11,650
That'll be a six many words.

227
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:11,950
I'll be like,

228
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,640
thanks mommy.

229
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,690
And then I just pull up.

230
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,280
So we told them we did that.

231
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,890
People sent us videos of them doing it.

232
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,630
Fucking hilarious.

233
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,660
Like a guy like getting his,

234
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:22,960
uh,

235
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,000
he was talking to a bill
play place and he's like,

236
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:25,540
hey mommy,

237
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,890
I don't understand what this bill means.

238
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,724
And the other guy's like,

239
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,031
yeah.

240
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:28,930
So that first section,

241
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,100
like they don't even address that
you're calling someone mommy or jeans or

242
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,060
saying thank you mommy,

243
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:34,820
or I love you mommy.

244
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,051
They're like,

245
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:35,321
okay,

246
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,150
have a good day.

247
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,983
Like they just,

248
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,020
it speaks more to almost how
preprogrammed customer service becomes,

249
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:41,680
you know,

250
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,100
they're not even acknowledging that you're
saying something ridiculous to them.

251
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,443
No,

252
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:46,751
no,

253
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:47,410
they're not.

254
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,190
It's hilarious.

255
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,023
Yeah.

256
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,051
But also like,

257
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,940
what are you saying when someone
says something like that to you?

258
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,750
You probably like,

259
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,650
you're so scrambled.

260
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:54,191
I think so.

261
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:54,550
Yeah.

262
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,930
Cause it doesn't make any sense.

263
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,370
It started off not making any sense,

264
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,140
but then it picked up
and made a lot of sense.

265
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,280
Yeah.

266
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,501
It's like,

267
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,090
well clearly you can talk English
and then it gets to the end.

268
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,160
He calls you mommy and you're like,

269
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:04,520
whoa.

270
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,180
What happened?

271
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,230
One time we called the,

272
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:06,530
uh,

273
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,240
the renaissance in Cincinnati,

274
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,840
the hotel,

275
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,411
the hotel,

276
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,180
because the year before,

277
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,014
before,

278
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,000
a few months before my son was born,

279
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:18,260
we were there for a wedding and
Christina had like a 32nd fart.

280
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,420
So we,

281
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,740
she's very pregnant.

282
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,970
We came back and we talked about it and
we decided it deserved its own names.

283
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,610
What's called the Cincinnati Fart.

284
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:28,881
Oh,

285
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:29,361
Jesus.

286
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:34,361
And we figured out what room number we
were in and we called the hotel and I go,

287
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,130
Hey,

288
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,881
can I help you?

289
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:38,110
I go,

290
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,943
I want a book.

291
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,400
I want to stay there,

292
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,610
but I want to commemorate
the Cincinnati part.

293
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,200
And she goes,

294
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,830
I'm sorry,

295
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,663
what was that?

296
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,180
And I go,

297
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,620
I want to stay in this room.

298
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,670
I think it's from six one eight,

299
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:51,320
because this Cincinnati
fart happened there.

300
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:51,891
And she goes,

301
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:52,910
I'm just having a little trouble.

302
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,744
What was that?

303
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,391
The what?

304
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:56,781
And I'm like,

305
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:57,860
this Cincinnati Fart.

306
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,783
And she's like,

307
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,500
can you spell it for me?

308
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:00,811
And I go,

309
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:01,100
yeah,

310
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,933
f eight.

311
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,120
And she stayed professional.

312
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,954
Like she was like,

313
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,261
oh,

314
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:06,920
okay,

315
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,200
I'll look and I'll see what I can show.

316
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,140
Yeah.

317
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,550
She didn't probably have cameras on you.

318
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,390
Yeah.

319
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,861
You can't go,

320
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,020
what the fuck are you talking about?

321
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:14,854
Why you waste my time?

322
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:15,621
Well,

323
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:16,580
I did have a,

324
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:17,240
uh,

325
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,410
a flooring guy.

326
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,071
I go,

327
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,650
can you do this floor for me?

328
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,311
And he's like,

329
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:22,401
well,

330
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,840
I can send you some samples.

331
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,201
And I go,

332
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,034
great.

333
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,341
He goes,

334
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:25,411
well,

335
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,150
who do I send it to?

336
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,710
I go to your mom's house.

337
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,060
And he was like,

338
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,840
what was that?

339
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,800
And I go at your mom's house.

340
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,071
He goes,

341
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,761
my mom's house.

342
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:31,911
I go,

343
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:32,031
no,

344
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,080
that's the name of our,

345
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,333
our company,

346
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,260
your mom's house.

347
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,340
And I go,

348
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:37,701
yeah.

349
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:38,240
And he was like,

350
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,480
all right,

351
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,170
you have a good day,

352
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,003
and he hung up the phone.

353
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,960
I'm going to go like I was.

354
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,873
I wasn't trying to,

355
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,200
for him it was a totally normal,

356
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:46,340
I wasn't trying to be funny.

357
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:46,551
I go,

358
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:46,651
no,

359
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,500
that's the name of the
company and want to listen.

360
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:48,831
He was like,

361
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:49,370
okay,

362
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,671
okay.

363
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:50,500
You have a good day.

364
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,120
Like wow.

365
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,620
Yeah.

366
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,010
Okay.

367
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,610
Did you try it?

368
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,630
You let him hang up.

369
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,730
You should have said it's
actually the name of podcasts.

370
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,860
We tried to explain it,

371
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:59,390
but he was looking it up on iTunes.

372
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,224
It's very popular.

373
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:00,890
He was,

374
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,060
he was pretty quick with like,

375
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,390
Oh,

376
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,140
this is a joke,

377
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,431
and I go,

378
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:03,860
oh,

379
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,640
okay.

380
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,230
He grew up with a lot of your mom jokes.

381
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,501
Yeah,

382
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:06,920
he did.

383
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,330
He's not liking it and not buying.

384
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,620
It seems like,

385
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:09,980
uh,

386
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,960
a guy that just didn't get it.

387
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,030
Can you play Fred?

388
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,260
Do we will you plays audio?

389
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,663
The glass and Guy?

390
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,510
Yeah.

391
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,130
It's,

392
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,930
where do you have it on your tongue?

393
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,773
It's on youtube.

394
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,441
Okay.

395
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:23,000
What is the name of the video?

396
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,500
It's called Sam.

397
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,730
It's saved on his phone.

398
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,950
Tell you,

399
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,850
give me one moment.

400
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,860
I'll look down at the ice house tonight.

401
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,803
Sold out.

402
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,711
I'm at,

403
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:37,130
I'm doing dom Irrera show tonight and
you're at the laugh factory tomorrow.

404
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:41,750
Tomorrow with Duncan Trussell
and Tony Hinchcliffe.

405
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,520
Doodoodoo got a couple of bop,

406
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:44,681
bop,

407
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:44,840
Bop,

408
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,021
bop,

409
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:45,171
bop,

410
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:45,351
bop,

411
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:45,501
bop,

412
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,600
Bop Moose down on 22nd it should be it.

413
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,440
Okay.

414
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,700
Crank it up.

415
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:50,991
Okay.

416
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,580
That looks like a compound bow.

417
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,543
Really

418
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,020
pull it out right there.

419
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:57,420
She couldn't tell it
was moving really quick.

420
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,591
Quick.

421
00:08:58,591 --> 00:08:58,771
Yeah.

422
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,491
That's a compound.

423
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,130
Will see the,

424
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,830
the cams at the top of the boat.

425
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,930
That's not a permanent boa at all.

426
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,220
That's I'm super modern bow,

427
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,430
I think,

428
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,920
but this dude knows how to do this.

429
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,190
He's,

430
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,571
Oh yeah,

431
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:11,731
I know.

432
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,541
He's so professional.

433
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,410
Bowhunter I've seen this
guy on TV a ton of time.

434
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,030
Yeah,

435
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,211
yeah,

436
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:15,810
yeah.

437
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,910
He's got a TV show that I watch.

438
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,420
Dude,

439
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,231
if you go over to my house,

440
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:21,900
you'd think I'm a crazy person.

441
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,130
You change your profile pic.

442
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,041
Yeah.

443
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,140
It's a silly picture of me with a
camera on my face hiding in the trees.

444
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,390
I'm trying to make sure
this is the right video.

445
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,370
I'm looking going through the trees.

446
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,370
Every one's life start,

447
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,550
but I can still see the
moon through the tree.

448
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,240
Blended in good.

449
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:37,610
We've got,

450
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,330
when does it get good at archery?

451
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,700
Archery moves down.

452
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:42,110
Yeah.

453
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,943
That was coming up

454
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,690
and I really like,

455
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,260
here we go.

456
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,471
Okay.

457
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:49,304
It's about that,

458
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,843
so you get the

459
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,723
full shot.

460
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,653
Wait,

461
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,460
it's countdown to the getting real funny.

462
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,240
I just spoke to her.

463
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,073
She's got to go down.

464
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,033
Watch her,

465
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,563
watch her.

466
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,710
She's going to go down right
through our law to Jesus.

467
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,840
I don't like this part.

468
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,550
[inaudible]

469
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,390
oh,

470
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,223
I was raised.

471
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,440
That is awesome.

472
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,160
We got out here early board.

473
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,173
Look,

474
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,973
this is why,

475
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,210
this is why we came up here.

476
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,300
We've been slipping along
this big huge meadow,

477
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,250
big long call meadow.

478
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,990
We'd been slipping along here,

479
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,550
just glassing juice,

480
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:45,390
glass and glass and all of
a sudden I hit even have,

481
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,650
I need to put my head in it on.

482
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:46,921
I'm like,

483
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:47,131
God,

484
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,750
we're just glass and
he's been cured by those.

485
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,980
Let's just keep going.

486
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,053
Let's glass.

487
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,080
Let's the guys.

488
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,970
I'm like,

489
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,900
holy smokes,

490
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,190
I've got a moose hook,

491
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:56,820
got a moose,

492
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,300
and I'm like,

493
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,751
oh man.

494
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:58,350
It's a bowl.

495
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,090
It's a bowl.

496
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,461
And I'm like,

497
00:10:59,461 --> 00:10:59,850
no,

498
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,590
it's a cow.

499
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,770
We got a cow right there.

500
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,870
That was unbelievable.

501
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,730
We came right around this tree.

502
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,673
She was,

503
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,160
is a cow

504
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,380
significant than a bowl?

505
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,340
No.

506
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,701
No.

507
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:12,530
Unless he only had a tag for a cow.

508
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,150
Oh,

509
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,090
it depends on why.

510
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,200
Why he shot a cow.

511
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,680
Not a,

512
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,513
not a bull.

513
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,740
Sometimes it depends on the unit.

514
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,070
Depends on how many cows they have
versus how many bowls they have.

515
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,690
They might want people to kill cows.

516
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,690
They probably want a certain
amount of cows to be killed a year.

517
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,481
They have weird,

518
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:28,790
um,

519
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,610
who decides that?

520
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:29,870
