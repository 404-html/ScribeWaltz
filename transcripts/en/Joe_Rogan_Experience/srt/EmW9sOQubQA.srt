1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,610
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,760
I try not to complain about just because
it's part of that is part of the job.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,780
And I'd rather do it then
work construction any day.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,440
But sometimes mentally is tough
to do a morning interview.

5
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:13,274
But if I have,

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,050
if I have,

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,330
you know,

8
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,940
take Adderall before dinner,

9
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,001
I'm snappy,

10
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:17,691
I got jumped,

11
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:19,370
I got anecdotes and then I can kind of,

12
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,170
I know sometimes now I've learned how to,

13
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,640
you got to take an interview
over sometimes or they want
to not go on a rant but

14
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:27,380
you have to not let them,

15
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,310
you know,

16
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,040
just cause they can get into that
cutting off your jokes and eh,

17
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,020
funny man handlebars just cut you off.

18
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,210
So just learning how to,

19
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,110
how to do that and just having the energy
and focus to be able to is it's real

20
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:39,944
helpful.

21
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,381
Yeah.

22
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,940
The morning radio thing,

23
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,050
if like they're good,

24
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,770
it's great.

25
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,530
It's real fun.

26
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,360
It's really fun.

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,460
Pro is supported and set you up.

28
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,500
And then sometimes they just say,

29
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,810
so what's funny in the world right now

30
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,000
in an interview the other day,

31
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,010
the guy asked me that exact question,

32
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,520
what's making you laugh right now?

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,130
Ah,

34
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,530
to Hannah,

35
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,190
but what are you talking about on stage?

36
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,310
Oh man,

37
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,380
that's another one they do.

38
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,190
Yeah.

39
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,300
Somebody asked me that before.

40
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:10,830
A show I was doing in New York.

41
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,550
What are you going to talk about?

42
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:11,821
Man,

43
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,630
just came over like,

44
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,130
so what are we talking about today?

45
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,690
Like you now,

46
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,713
you

47
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,150
dudes that would go,

48
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,043
well,

49
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,070
here's my new piece.

50
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,100
It's all about how man is constricted by
a first his mom and then his wife and a

51
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,560
then ultimately his lawyer.

52
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,450
Yeah.

53
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:31,710
Yeah.

54
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,011
I mean,

55
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:33,300
I guess the thing is just,

56
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,010
I try to remember that people aren't
coming from a shitty place normally.

57
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,720
They just don't know how to communicate
to me in a way that won't make me feel

58
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,620
cynical and hate them.

59
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,951
You know what I mean?

60
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:47,060
So I gotta keep that in mind,

61
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,700
but in the moment it's
like what the fuck it,

62
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
you just ask me what's
funny in a world right now

63
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,790
for someone who's not a comic,

64
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,860
they wouldn't understand
how awkward that would be.

65
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,120
Like when you like when you can go on a
radio show and they just let you talk.

66
00:01:59,121 --> 00:01:59,954
Right.

67
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,381
Hang out,

68
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:01,160
let's just hang out,

69
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,551
hang out,

70
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:04,040
talk about stuff back and
forth from each other.

71
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,760
Yeah.

72
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,180
Yeah.

73
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,961
It's not a lot of them.

74
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:06,860
They can do that though.

75
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,873
That's the problem.

76
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,250
Do you ever do those radio tours?

77
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:14,210
We have to call like 10 different people
and then you realize like eight of them

78
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,200
have the same voice,

79
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,090
like almost exactly.

80
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,611
What does this,

81
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,560
the radio voice,

82
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,581
I don't know what,

83
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:20,600
when it was tested,

84
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,940
when it was,

85
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,210
it was,

86
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:22,590
it was a,

87
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,990
it was a study that people,

88
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,190
that people like to listen to.

89
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:25,911
This right here,

90
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,320
we live here in Nashville.

91
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,410
We got Hannibal bears in the studio
when alive here in Cincinnati.

92
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:31,244
We got had,

93
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,810
it's a couple versions of that.

94
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:34,610
This is a couple of
versions of that wisdom,

95
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,000
you know?

96
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,370
And it was the sports guy as well.

97
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,720
Gus Johnson here for showtime.

98
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,440
There's the news guy.

99
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,450
It's just the same as um,

100
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,470
rappers though too.

101
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,940
They rappers rap voice.

102
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,000
You'd talk to rapidly.

103
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,100
My sound like me,

104
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,850
but then when in there wrapped it like,

105
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,820
you know what it is?

106
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,160
It's a persona.

107
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,900
It's just a persona that you know,

108
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,280
works for that situation.

109
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,110
I like it though.

110
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,711
I like the,

111
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:00,610
the Gus Johnson

112
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,181
type voice,

113
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:01,841
like of a guys.

114
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,080
Uh,

115
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,730
like when I say that about Gus Johnson,

116
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,541
I'm not putting them down.

117
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:04,691
Like,

118
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,520
I liked that professional.

119
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,040
Here we are Madison Square Garden.

120
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,570
I don't want a guy who's like,

121
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,433
Hey,

122
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,120
I'm like me.

123
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,750
Like I,

124
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,680
when I do the UFC,

125
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:17,770
there's a reason why I'm the color
guy and I'm not the play by play guy.

126
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,180
I don't do the big,

127
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,790
here we are Joe FC one 52.

128
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,810
Like those guys are important.

129
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,183
I like that.

130
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,110
I mean it is as tree,

131
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,740
its pageantry isn't a reason
why Michael buffer works well.

132
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:29,951
Yeah.

133
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,140
That's even more so
because he's a announcer.

134
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,930
Let's get ready to rumble.

135
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:35,970
This pageantry dog.

136
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,800
It's pageants.

137
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,040
Yeah.

138
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,600
Yeah.

139
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,560
I'm not putting it down,

140
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,110
but it is weird radios when radio he'll
cause you don't have to talk like radio

141
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,450
is different cause it's
supposed to be your personality.

142
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,140
You know what I mean?

143
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,870
Like sports doesn't spoil as a guide.

144
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:50,530
The news is the news,

145
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,170
but radios was to be your vibe.

146
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,510
But then you sound like the
dude in Saint Louis also.

147
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,910
You sound like the dude
who was all over the place.

148
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,080
Every guy you know another place where
that exists was that Strip club Djs?

149
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,003
Uh,

150
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,400
yeah.

151
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,540
I've been trying to analyze this for many
years and I think with Strip club Djs,

152
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,680
it's like no one wants to hear a dude
talking while girls are dancing naked.

153
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,180
You do not want to hear that guy.

154
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,310
So he's got to make it like a song.

155
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,920
Like all right,

156
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,400
come in to this stage.

157
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,750
It's amber.

158
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,050
Remember everybody $40 comic cons.

159
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:25,450
It's like there's an entertainment
aspect to the what he's doing.

160
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:27,310
It's like he's almost
like he's singing a song.

161
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,740
But have you been to a black
strip club in Atlanta though?

162
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,070
No stitches.

163
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:31,720
No.

164
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,200
Those djs out of most amazing Dj's.

165
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,280
Vocally f really because
they drive the tipping.

166
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,740
You know what I mean?

167
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,360
Right,

168
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,760
right.

169
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,840
They crack jokes.

170
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,630
I asked when I was,

171
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,500
it's just so funny.

172
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:45,751
It's like,

173
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:45,991
man,

174
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:49,060
you need to pay the pussy like they here.

175
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,400
Y'all ain't spending money.

176
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:51,240
They'll drop the track.

177
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,980
They come cut the track by God.

178
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,330
Spend some mother fucking money.

179
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:55,640
Look what she's doing up there.

180
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,474
She's up there.

181
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,730
The Atlanta Dj's and Strip club.

182
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,751
Amazing.

183
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:01,650
They to Atlanta,

184
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,540
probably just other black.

185
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:09,541
That black strip clubs like the DJ drives
that Shit and is the driving force and

186
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,740
as an entertainer in addition to add,

187
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,583
he adds to it.

188
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,140
See now I'm weighing the potential
dangers of going to a black strip club in

189
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:22,890
Atlanta with the entertainment
aspect of how amazing.

190
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:23,940
It must be dangerous man.

191
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,230
Isn't that a guy like me?

192
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,923
I'm sure.

193
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,250
I'm sure I need to go.

194
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,250
If I go with you,

195
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,141
I'll go with you.

196
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:35,070
I could slide right in.

197
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,690
I'm not even that blood.

198
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:41,691
Then I play but not black
in a black strip club.

199
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,320
The djs,

200
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,070
the right famous ones is fate.

201
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,030
I don't know the names
though cause I have a bit,

202
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,350
but you go to somewhere uh,

203
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,780
magic city or magic city.

204
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,520
A few other ones in Atlanta.

205
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,300
Uh,

206
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,870
the Dj is is,

207
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,530
is important and makes the Strip was more
money and a strep was probably end up

208
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,110
tipping out the DJ.

209
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,110
Sure.

210
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,351
Yeah.

211
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,220
They have like an arrangement,

212
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:04,431
right?

213
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,090
Yeah.

214
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,590
My friend Eddie used to
work at a strip club.

215
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,710
I used to go and visit him
at work watching who's a DJ.

216
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,841
So I got to,

217
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:11,930
I got to see the craft.

218
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,550
I got to see how everybody does it.

219
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,290
It's interesting the
relationship they all have,

220
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,160
it becomes just like,

221
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,780
I mean you might as well
be working in a restaurant.

222
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,640
Everybody develops the same
sort of blue lights man.

223
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,513
Exactly.

224
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,110
People get naked and that's,

225
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,580
it's weird cause it's porn.

226
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:26,540
Porn is like that too.

227
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,180
Like those people get used to each
other and it becomes just like any other

228
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,463
normal,

229
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:30,971
see you later.

230
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:31,160
Good.

231
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,840
Jason on I'm

232
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,553
season.

233
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,340
I think it's probably funny when it's
just somebody you fucked like two years

234
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:39,760
ago.

235
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,140
Oh good to see you again.

236
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,080
They,

237
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,230
I think they have definitely a
more relaxed attitude about it.

238
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,950
Yeah.

239
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,311
You know,

240
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:49,460
if you run into somebody that
used to fuck out of nowhere,

241
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,303
you're like,

242
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,483
Hey,

243
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,180
this is me getting me.

244
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,010
I'll see you naked naked.

245
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:56,400
All right.

246
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,233
You take care of.

247
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,100
Don't mind that Mo.

248
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,280
It's weird when you haven't seen someone
at 20 years and then you get to see

249
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:02,461
like,

250
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:03,294
whoa,

251
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,291
this is weird.

252
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:04,831
This is weird.

253
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:05,311
Hello,

254
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:06,150
Nina Hartley.

255
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,091
I met her.

256
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:10,960
She's a very nice lady.

257
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,530
She was doing Kevin Pereira as podcasts.

258
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

259
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,391
I Sat,

260
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,840
sat in with her and
talked to her for awhile.

261
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,250
She does everything with gloves on,

262
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:17,910
man.

263
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,360
Really?

264
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,541
Yeah.

265
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,100
She was like sex sessions with people.

266
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,110
She puts like surgical gloves on one.

267
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:22,791
Yes,

268
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,860
he does corporates,

269
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,390
right.

270
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,223
Does she?

271
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,601
I think a lot,

272
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:29,990
Phil.

273
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,321
Yeah.

274
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,330
A lot of them to do like corporate gigs.

275
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,620
Corporates in quotes.

276
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,873
The quotes,

277
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:35,981
I guess.

278
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:36,610
Sort of.

279
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,443
Yeah,

280
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,160
and the way that corporates,

281
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,650
private privates.

282
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,513
Yes.

283
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,290
She probably does a lot of privates.

284
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,161
Yeah.

285
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:45,994
Like you know.

286
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,740
Yeah.

287
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,120
Very few comics do privates.

288
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,580
What would you do if someone said,

289
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:52,330
hey man,

290
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,020
Hannibal Burress,

291
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,970
I want you to come over
and just do comedy.

292
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:55,804
Just for me.

293
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,750
I'm just a big comedy fan but I don't
like going to comedy clubs because it's

294
00:07:58,751 --> 00:07:59,410
fucking,

295
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,740
I don't like laughing around are the
people so we can just do your act for me

296
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,890
and I'll pay you what you get paid for
like a regular show for a packed house

297
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,670
for no,

298
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,130
they add the charge to my,

299
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,810
my corporate college.

300
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:11,500
Right.

301
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,333
Okay.

302
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,710
Well I wouldn't want to do that.

303
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,050
So can I bring somebody with me?

304
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,140
Well now you're worried about your safety.

305
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,651
Don't worry.

306
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:20,940
The guys only going to masturbate.

307
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,670
He promised this nothing really crazy.

308
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,730
He just wants to watch you just,

309
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,640
he's gonna keep his pants.

310
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,990
Well you keep a towel on.

311
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,940
Nah,

312
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,210
I'm not doing that good cause I don't
need the money that bad cause I got my own

313
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,200
supplement business

314
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,621
so I'm that,

315
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:35,961
you know,

316
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:37,760
I could do stuff as I want to do it,

317
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,250
you know.

318
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:38,491
All right.

319
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:40,740
How about if the dude
wears like a space suit?

320
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,730
The space suit?

321
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,290
Yeah.

322
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,410
She sits there with a space.

323
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,730
You don't know my logo set.

324
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,253
Fucking full set.

325
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,341
How line?

326
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:48,174
Say

327
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,900
for one dude,

328
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,741
but one dude,

329
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:52,800
can I bring an opener?

330
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,973
No,

331
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,291
to warm up.

332
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,860
He's going to watch your past
specials so I can't even,

333
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,680
I can't even drop him stuff.

334
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,420
I got to do an hour news.

335
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:09,950
Well,

336
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,160
it feels a fan man.

337
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,941
You already know.

338
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:12,651
He already said it.

339
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:12,900
Yeah.

340
