1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,470
And tremendous. It's tremendous.
He has a a Hector Lombard sprawl,

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:08,880
you know Hector Lumbar? Yeah. Slams a
motherfucker down when he sprawls on you.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,730
Hector Lombard has that.
We live, we live right now.

4
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:14,130
Hector Lombard has the
scariest Bra I've ever seen.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,340
Like when he snapped down Tim Boetsch,
it was like bitch,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,610
it wasn't just the wrong

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,460
date or had a crazy sprawl.
Actually he did,

8
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,680
but he was ready to crack
as soon as he got up.

9
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:30,540
Fatal was more wild in the transition
like wild punches and judo throws and

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,990
shit.
Fader was always wild and the transitions,

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,110
but I'm telling you Tim Boetsch and
Anthony Rumble Johnson at two the scariest

12
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:39,940
fucking sprawls I've ever seen.
Just how the zoom,

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,640
the presses like none of this is going on.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,760
And who was he fighting next?
I don't know.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,390
Little Mario. Mario Little
Nog Tam. Oh No, no, no, no,

16
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:58,020
no. Let me tell you some little,
Nog is a very good boxer. In fact,

17
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:00,720
he fought for the Brazilian national team.
He medalled,

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,790
he met for the Brazilian national team.

19
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:06,420
He's a bad motherfucker with his striking.
That's shut Rashad Evans Noun.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,660
Like if you watch that Rashad Evans fight,
it wasn't the best fight for a shot.

21
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:10,920
He was a little off in that fight.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,620
But one of the reasons why he
was a little office, cause no,

23
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:16,860
Garrett tagged him a couple of times
in that first round with clean shots.

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,300
He's a clean boxers. It's real
crisp technique and nothing flashy,

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,480
but he knows what the fuck he's doing
and he'll let you up zig when you

26
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:28,170
should've zagged. He'll, he'll crack
you. Him and his brother. Fuck yeah.

27
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,160
Whole all shit happens.

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,990
Someone's got a little
personal experiences share
somewhat ought to sit this kid.

29
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,090
He's better than his brother. Yeah, he's,
he's better than his brother's a boxer.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,980
And he also submitted Dan Henderson.

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,540
He's one of the bolts submitted both
brothers and that crazy little noggin.

32
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,110
Big Nog. Both got him in an arm bar who
is so he's better. You think little knock?

33
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:56,070
It's actually better than his brother.
No, I think he's got better boxing,

34
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:58,980
but his brother was definitely more
successful, was the MMA fighter.

35
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:02,580
But it's only slightly better.
Like when you talk about like better look,

36
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,290
if the little nog in his brother boxed,

37
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,120
either one of them could
knock each other out.

38
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:08,010
It doesn't always play out that way.
Right?

39
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,130
Like Brendan and I were talking about
this before the podcast about no one

40
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,120
catches a lucky rear naked choke. Nope.
If two black belts are going at it,

41
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,300
the guy who taps the guy
is the better guy. Right?

42
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,050
But if two guys are slugging it out in
the gym, you fucking Shit can happen, man.

43
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,883
I seen guys,

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,940
I've seen guys who are really good get
lit up by a guy who's not that good in

45
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:31,290
the gym. It just get cracked with
a shot. You run into a hard jab,

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,940
something that takes your legs out,
but there are lucky shots and Jujitsu,

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,690
why live Jitsu is Dana that I was in like,
ah damn,

48
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,630
I accidentally called him in the
ankle luck. You know what I'm saying?

49
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,680
There's none of that ever after. Now I
accidentally got a rolling wheel hook.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,500
You actually got to know what you're
doing and I can get lucky. You know,

51
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,050
you can throw any fat Duke
and throw a big right hand.

52
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,550
It hit you in the right spot.
What is it?

53
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,620
What is the one Jujitsu moves that it
has had the highest rate of success?

54
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,160
Let's let everybody know round one

55
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,830
of the John Linacre fight is
right about to take place.

56
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,380
If you listened to this podcast,
you never heard this.

57
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,120
This no philosophizing is what we're
doing is we're watching fights.

58
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:12,520
He has the fights are taking place.
We're talking shit.

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,850
Joey motherfucking Diaz's here.
Holla at your boy Joe Diaz.

60
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,100
What's happening and the job just
sitting in Brian Cowen, learn the fights.

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,690
The fight started.
You could probably,

62
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,900
it says four 43 right
there when I said that,

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,370
that's what it says as far as the time,

64
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:30,340
if you want to sync up because there's
a bit of a difference between the fights

65
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,940
and the, the uh, live
broadcast that we're doing.

66
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:36,560
There's like a 15 second delay,
something like that,

67
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,970
that look for me to make a lot of
comments in this fight. Companion guys,

68
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,830
shut down. John Lineker, that dude with
the red shorts. It's a fucking beast.

69
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,950
He's one of the hardest hitting
flyweights in the world.

70
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,970
GEICO racks but can't make the weight
keeps fucking up and missing is miss miss

71
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,880
this nice his weight cut twice. He would
have already had a shot at the title.

72
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,810
Look at how he hits this mother
fucker would a heart shot. He left,

73
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:02,020
hooks him to the upper rib cage.
Takes away worse.

74
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,100
Those are Ruth. It's Linacre
can fucking, I'm telling you,

75
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,970
I've seen a lot of dudes that
are in this weight class cracked.

76
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,600
He's totally different than all of them.
If, if every one 25 was like Linacre,

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,640
this would be a hugely exciting division.

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,810
This is mother fucker puts guys to sleep.
He hits hard.

79
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:23,380
He's got like weird power.
Like when he, when he hits you,

80
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,830
you see dudes like go like, whoa.
Nobody ever hit me like that before.

81
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:31,210
Bed At 1305120520 five
he's a flyweight man.

82
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,280
So he was supposed to be fighting with Dj.

83
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,420
Well that's why as a hard time making one
25 obviously you look at this, Ooh, Ooh,

84
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,350
Ooh, oh shit. Nice
takedown. Good strength.

85
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:42,910
Okay,

86
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,810
well, let me see. Is
from Brazil. Yeah. Att.

87
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,130
No,

88
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,420
pretty sure, right? Yeah. To set up a, uh,

89
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,760
he's doing a good job getting over that
leg. That left leg. Oh look, he's out.

90
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,390
He's out. He's out. Hmm. Oh, he left
that to be on top of him. You know what?

91
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:02,520
That's what's, that's what
sucks about the cage, right?

92
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,350
You can't skip your hips
back. Go shrimping. Yeah.
You're just stuck right there.

93
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,530
I think the cage benefits wrestlers
a lot more with their heavy hips.

94
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:15,410
The ground and pound. It's definitely
an advantage for a wrestler.

95
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,400
Is there a Jujitsu move that has had
the highest percentage of success in the

96
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:24,380
UFC? Rear naked choke. Yeah. Probably
a choke. Maybe a gay teen, Nick Eugene.

97
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,430
I think the most would be a rear naked.
Well, let's thank you. Sure had it.

98
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,130
I'm sure there's a stat
somewhere, right? Okay. What?

99
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,980
Submit on an Anaconda. Wait, hold
up. There's only been one that

100
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,370
Brendan, come on. Stop.

101
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,670
Stop you silly goose. Well,
other guys have hit anacondas
haven't done in the UFC.

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,500
Didn't. Um, I'm the heavyweight
division. Did, um, did Dave,

103
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,470
Phil Davis,
did he get a Doris Ah,

104
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,950
Gustafson Conda that's light
heavyweight it. Oh, that's right.

105
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,300
You said heavyweight. Sorry,
I thought you said in the UFC.

106
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,080
Oh, well he, but he did get
it. I know there's been,

107
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,460
there's been a bunch of Anacondas I
spend the heavyweight division a dope his

108
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:14,880
name right? Yeah. Anaconda choked
with, with the dope or name that uh,

109
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,310
an Anaconda killing somebody. Everybody
wants to be an Anaconda in Jujitsu.

110
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,350
This is the,
uh,

111
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,770
this is the fucking is the kangaroo
choke what it away from me,

112
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,310
but I want to add a condom on the fuckers.

113
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,960
Catch you do with the Anacostia.

114
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,600
Don't remember last time I saw besides
with it not with a kick butt with a punch,

115
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,820
somebody takes them down
with a liver shot. Oh,

116
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:42,650
it happens all the time
with hands with hands.

117
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,290
Well it happens with all kinds of things.
Kicks Gas but not,

118
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,470
I don't know about hands. I see
boxing, but not, it definitely happens.

119
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,210
That's when you know the
guys a high level striker,

120
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,300
if he's going to the bottom right,
especially in a high level fight.

121
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:57,130
If the hot high pressure fighting's go on
the body, he's a really hard to set up.

122
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:59,300
Right. You've seen Fabio
Miles Denato fight. Right.

123
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,720
You know he's not at the level
of the top guys and he got,

124
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,160
he got chewed up by music.

125
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:07,370
He just should not be we we called that
one just shouldn't have been fighting

126
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:10,820
heavy, just smaller. And Neo
chick is a sanction. That fight.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,090
I agree with you 100% it was
a Brazilian sanctioning fight.

128
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,520
I don't think they probably
would have accepted it in Vegas.

129
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,900
Neil chick just had way too much for
him. Too much power, too much technique.

130
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,390
I Steve pay looked
fucking fantastic though.

131
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,110
He looked really crisp in that fight.
The Greeley. Yeah. Yeah. He looks,

132
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,760
he looked great. I'll, I'll,

133
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,250
I'll fuck frigging and drive
down to Poland from falls out.

134
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,610
If you want to hype it up.
How dare you.

135
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,610
I'm just saying it's a mismatch. Yes.
It wasn't well, and not only that,

136
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,490
he was a lot bigger too.
It looked like it was way bigger.

137
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,650
Maldinado was supposed
to be on another fight.

138
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,140
All should probably be find that 70 let's
be honest. Oh Shit. No you didn't. No.

139
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:53,780
For Real. No. He can make 70
it's got some extra weight.

140
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,820
He definitely has a few pounds.

141
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,650
He's a beast of a fight or some of the
best box and if not the best box in it.

142
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,720
Yeah,
well he's the best.

143
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,010
He's like one of the best at just and
shots and it's still coming forward.

144
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,760
Clover, clover. That was
tough to watch. Yeah, man.

145
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,420
But what about when he clipped Glover
with that left hand? It was kind of like,

146
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:17,570
oh shit. What's going on here? That
was pretty crazy. All right. One,

147
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,620
just want to see global versus DC.
That would have been a great fight.

148
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:24,950
Very interesting fight. Very DC
against anybody's very interesting.

149
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,740
Rear naked choke is number one.
That's what I thought. Yeah.

150
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:31,210
Rear naked choke is numero uno.
Number two. I'm going to say guilty

151
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,710
maybe. Armbar right? Nope.
Guilty. Let's see. Yeah,

152
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:40,850
because with wrestlers, a
lot of times people shoot in.
Yup. Guillotine number two.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,150
Number two is killed and kind of crank
on someone's neck and choke them out.

154
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,120
Even if you're not, you know. Yeah. If you
don't know what you're doing. Yeah, yeah.

155
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,360
Like try and get pulling off budget doors.
If you don't know what you're doing,

156
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,130
try pulling off a Peruvian necktie.
Yeah, good fun. Yeah, but you right.

157
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,040
If you get someone's head

158
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,950
in there, you kind of headline
tangles. So for example,

159
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:03,810
chill Solon jail's not known for his
Jujitsu Gel. Sonin versus Shogun.

160
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,850
When he got him that Guillotine,
it was just kind of,

161
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:09,300
and he's arching back in like
straight Chels straight on.

162
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,100
But a lot of guys are arching back now.

163
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,470
A lot of guys are arching back if
they have a different angle, you know,

164
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,020
it used to be like,
would that army and teen that you,

165
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,360
everybody would have to say,
always say that you have to smother it.

166
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,710
But Eddie Bravo.

167
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,360
Now there's also a way to do it if
you're like sideways where you're arching

168
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:28,770
back, arch back sideways. He's like from
certain angles it's okay to arch back.

169
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,360
It's like that's the
complexity of Jujitsu. It's
just little tiny adjustments.

170
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:37,770
Like we were talking before the podcast
about Amal Easton taught me a variation

171
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:40,860
on the guillotine that was
really good for the defense,

172
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,570
which is to go over the top or the back.

173
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:46,500
But also there's just little variation
in the way you hold it made the bone of

174
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:51,150
the arm dig into the neck and just
that one little thing was like, ah,

175
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,690
fuck. But when you're looking
at it, it almost looks the same.

176
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,490
Like when someone shows it to you,

177
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:59,900
they're just showing you one little
tiny tweak. But that tiny tweak has it

178
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,970
with wrestling. It's interesting
because when the, when before the,

179
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,770
when the wall was up with the Soviet
Union and, and, and East Germany,

180
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,210
when they would meet,

181
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,150
they had their own technique and the
west have their own techniques and,

182
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,320
and they would watch tape on each other,
but they couldn't figure out really how,

183
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:20,470
what they were doing. Right.
Because it was so subtle when,

184
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:22,480
when the wall came down in the east,

185
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,060
all those eastern European started
coming over to the United States and

186
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:26,050
wrestling with those guys.

187
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,370
Wrestling changed dramatically like in
10 years because everybody's starting to

188
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:33,460
share their secrets because they couldn't
figure it out. Just watching tape.

189
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:35,920
It wasn't like you watched boxing.
It was so subtle.

190
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:39,610
The little differences like you're
talking about on like how one guy would

191
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:42,760
should a double leg or where he was
holding on the knee and stuff like that.

192
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,130
Made a huge Delta who didn't
give a shit about techniques.

193
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,820
You could show him whatever he wanted.
Whatever he did worked Shane color.

194
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:51,070
When they got a hold of your neck,
he was like,

195
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:53,560
how's that feeling like you're
literally about to break my neck.

196
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,110
I'm going to snap my neck.
He's way too busy too.

197
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,910
He's just too big of a human being.

198
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,510
I was at a malls place and he walked in
and he had a rash guard on like the skin

199
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:05,420
cut tight rash guards, short sleeve
rash guard, no fights scheduled, so z,

200
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,600
whatever the fuck he wants, including
Beck, Mexican supplements. Right. So he,

201
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:13,930
he lost him to the gym and he
didn't even look like a human.

202
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,680
He looked like Shrek.
Like if Shrek was a real person,

203
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,350
like it was so much bigger than everybody.
They're like, this is ridiculous.

204
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,880
Training partner for base my entire
career since I moved out to the Lord,

205
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,910
he and me, it would no one won't
work with. It was just me and Shane.

206
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:31,420
Shane took me under his wing and
paid for my private training.

207
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,050
But in exchange I was the only one
who would spar with him. Oh my God.

208
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,380
One day and I'll look and go put it hood,
his personal business out there.

209
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,710
But one day he was going through
some rough times at home.

210
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,510
Shamo is stressed out and he's 300
pounds and works kicking his ass and he's

211
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:49,390
very, very stressed out and
he's having girl problems.

212
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,370
So I show up to spar and this motherfucker
is there super like he's on the

213
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:57,760
couch, he's on the couch, right? I'm
like, what the hell are you doing dog?

214
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,970
He's like, oh, it was rough. Like
you know, she has a deep voice.

215
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,930
It was rough last night, slept. He
slept at the gym. I'm good though.

216
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,780
Literally almost in tears.
So I'm like, whatever man.

217
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,010
We spar and I catch him
with a decent right hand.

218
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,930
He has headgear on 300 pounds,
shaved silver back gorilla.

219
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,960
I hit him with a good
right hand and he goes,

220
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,190
fuck.
Ripped his head gear up,

221
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,750
shakes the cage tears or in his eyes,
he's just dealing with other stuff.

222
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,610
He's not doing well.
And I'm like, Oh fuck.

223
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Oh it's me. It's me. Him and our coach,

224
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,880
Trevor Whitman was there
throwing Trevor and

225
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,650
Trevor goes, Shane, take a minute.
No, I'm good, I'm good. And I'm like,

226
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,940
what about me? Man? Don't

227
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,880
freaking out crying. Oh my God, that's
terrifying. He knocked out and saw Tommy.

228
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,780
He knocked out Gonzaga with a six
inch punch. It was like this far.

229
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,420
But when you're free,
when you're aspiring with him,

230
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:13,440
the head is not doing shit
really against those giant myth.

231
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:18,010
So that's why my foot work
got good because no, there's,

232
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:22,300
there's no what you got hit by
Shink carver and fist. Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,790
I mean if everything that he was
just, he just fit your, your heart.

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,860
Your heart is beating every day,
every everything.

235
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,090
Your heart's beating all the
time. Like, you're right,

236
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,900
you're not looking forward to sparring.
It's sucks, right. I was terrible.

237
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,920
I would sit in my car before and she'd be
like, God damn, I don't want to do this.

238
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,570
And then Shane would text me where he
at, Bro. Ah. I just parked, coming,

239
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,800
talking to my, what else when
it comes from Tony Rob talking,

240
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,160
I stopped talking and he leaves. I started
talking again. It was like Deebo dog.

241
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,190
He's just punk guy. He hit so
hard. He was so big too. Oh Man.

242
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,150
The first round again, Brock Lesnar, man,

243
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,930
that was the game changer when he did
that thing where he picked me up and

244
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,900
squeeze me and I started tapping
and he and I heard him whisper,

245
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,290
I'm only at 40% pro my arm.

246
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:12,550
I had he hit a nerve or something for
like a month later my arm and get these

247
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:17,020
weird numb smells when Shane would drink.
He's one of those guys who had hit ya.

248
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,860
I hate being hill. You're 300 pounds.
We're in downtown Denver for sure.

249
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,750
Don't hit me in front of people.
I would, my body be tore up. Hey,

250
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,110
he's all busted up from football.
Yeah, it's back like bonds, wrestling.

251
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,970
Cause by them I mean, yeah, he was
a middle linebacker at western.

252
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,410
She got a tryout with the Philadelphia
Eagles and then he wrestled, you know,

253
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,040
high, high caliber wrestler Man College,
High School, everything. Yeah, you,

254
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,880
Bonnie just can only take so much.
So soft tissue areas,

255
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,120
the breakdown areas inside the toilet.
Man, I miss that guy. Ooh. Do I miss him?

256
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,770
Best training partner I've ever had.
Good dude to be around.

257
00:14:52,771 --> 00:14:56,090
It was one of the guys went when I can
afford to work with Trevor Whitman,

258
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:59,590
who was like this crazy, right.
W had world champions. Um,

259
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,860
Shane sought him out and was
like, hey, come with me. I'm
like, Brian, what do you,

260
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,940
what do you mean, give them a fucking
backroad for myth or I've got nothing.

261
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,850
You're right. I didn't
have much money. And uh,

262
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,600
Shane talked with them and then
the next day he was like, hey,

263
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,190
you're coming with me.
Shana. Have a ton of money.

264
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:16,190
Either he just put it all on his credit
card, paid for mine and his private.

265
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,270
So me and Shane workout at the
same time. Wow. That's pretty cool.

266
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,990
Very cool of them. What is it like working
with Whitman? You're like Whitman. Yeah.

267
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,460
Yeah.
Women's biggest thing man is he's just,

268
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:30,200
he's a super positive guy
and he's creative, you know?
And um, yeah, I mean listen,

269
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,380
when he did was with Shane and, and,
and with me was, was pretty cool.

270
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,530
He had two straight flat canvases.
Me and Shane were like,

271
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:41,450
rock 'em sock 'em robots, which is
why I stutter now. It's every round,

272
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,840
every round they would give
us the 32nd marker. We,

273
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,110
no matter what we're doing on the ground
wrestling, whatever, we'd both get up,

274
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:51,400
go to send an octagon, hit gloves and
sit there and punch each other in the,

275
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,620
I wish, I wish Trevor would be like,
Hey Brendan, listen. That's great.

276
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,240
Ron, do you a solid, don't
do that anymore, right?

277
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,540
Because you played football for your
whole life and then you free spark.

278
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,400
You sparred with Shane Carmen for
eight years. You definitely have.

279
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,170
You definitely have some brain tree.
I'll tell you what though.

280
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,250
Best literally best train partner
in the war. He get a brain trauma.

281
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:17,220
Look at this fucking thing.
You guys are missing a crazy fight.

282
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:21,060
Linacre is going off, man.
Jesus Christ guys are landing.

283
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,430
Oh, crazy man. Yeah, but Linacre is like,
it's just a difference. When he hits you,

284
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,060
it just sucks. This is why the injuries.
I talked to Joe Daddy, I worked with them.

285
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,090
You got a good body shot in there. Joe
Daddy. I said, do you have any injuries?

286
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:36,540
He goes, yeah, I got to crack
pelvis. Um, broke my pelvis,

287
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,610
broke three bones in my neck. I was
like, Jesus broke my pelvis. I said,

288
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:44,610
how'd you do that? He goes, I don't
know. A fight. I think I got kicked. Oh,

289
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:49,420
you don't know. Oh, okay.
Broke. Yeah, Bob Sapp. It's
ridiculous by the way. It's fine.

290
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,430
It's incredible.

291
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,723
Okay.

292
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,070
You know what's
incredible? I'm looking. I,

293
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,470
Lennox said he starts about three rows up.

294
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,500
Check out the people three rows and
beyond looking at fat dude, he always,

295
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,683
sure

296
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,480
you guys have no fucking
idea what Atlantic city is.

297
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,510
I've never been hell first bus white
trash in from all fucking ports.

298
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,970
It's 15 to get on the bus and to go
to Atlantic city. He is the clinker,

299
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,170
they give you $10 in quarters
when you get to Atlantic city.

300
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,780
So they basically give you $10 back.

301
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,870
Then they give you a book of
coupons for another 50 to eat.

302
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,140
We try to keep you there all day.
So if you go,

303
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,300
let's say at the eight
o'clock in the morning bus,

304
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,170
you can't leave till five
whether you're broke,

305
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:45,580
whether you wait all your coupons,
you cannot go back on the fuck

306
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,230
the,

307
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,230
they have a scam every fucking hour on
the hour from all points in New Jersey

308
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,080
and New York buses go down
to Atlantic city right now.

309
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,190
Half those people sitting there,

310
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:04,170
I've already lost that money and they
just killing time to the midnight bus and

311
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:06,780
somebody from the UFC just
happened to give him nice tickets.

312
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,540
They're sitting there,
they don't even know what the fuck

313
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,130
bookmaker,

314
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,570
who's going to win the fucking the Yankee
game because that's how they're going

315
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:19,770
to bounce back on Sunday and they could
go down to the shore and they look at

316
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:23,940
them. They're mummified.
It looks like fucking old.

317
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:27,860
And this is silver right there on his
face. That's Atlantic City for you.

318
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,590
Where's fucking Dana and this room
where they body got good body shot.

319
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,110
Where's Dana White?
He ain't nobody responding yet.

320
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,940
They haven't showed him the
fatigue or brothers fuck over.

321
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,800
They were in that room to hide.

322
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,650
Yeah. And the the the main
like, like Fox sports fight.

323
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,780
It comes out for that.
Like towards the end,

324
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,390
like when we have that
thing where we sit down,

325
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,710
we start breaking down the fights in
the man card. That's when he comes back.

326
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,540
He's guys are gonna Act Dag Oscar
that you can take it though, man.

327
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,330
He seemed to some hard shot
standing his ground, man.

328
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,790
You guys are sweating hombre.

329
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,500
Fucking Dana white comes in like
deliver on Goodfellas, shaking the hands

330
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,880
towards the end. Shaking
hands, boy that people,

331
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,310
people,

332
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,040
when is there ever been $1 billion
organization with a president like that?

333
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,000
I know he's, he's a character in a
movie. He doesn't even exist in a movie.

334
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,200
Go get his Twitter feed.
He goes back and forth with idiots.

335
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,210
Idiots talk shit talk
shit right back to him.

336
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,650
Makes Fun of their pictures and shit. He's
fucking funny. It's fucking funny man.

337
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:44,790
People get angry and he's like, I'm having
a good time. It's different for sure.

338
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,250
I stand never Tim Tebow. He walks
by, he goes, Tim Tebow, Timothy,

339
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,180
well thanks for coming out. And it just
keeps walking by. Just shouts at them.

340
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,130
It works. It works. You know groups,

341
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,510
the tiny man because the kid is tough as
shit. Oh school. Which is no joke man.

342
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,530
But he has eaten some bombs and
Linacre is just coming on a man.

343
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,410
I like this guy. Oh Shit.
Mixed up them kick sons.

344
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,890
How some guys can take these kids,
Huh? Well he was kicking earlier.

345
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:17,880
He landed some really good leg kicks.
He just turned it into.

346
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,740
How often is it slippery in there? Because
people say that the canvas is very,

347
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,440
I, I've never really had
an issue with the canvas.

348
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,350
The only time I've had an issue is when,
uh,

349
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,160
one of the fight monsters,
I was fighting the, uh,

350
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,780
when the logos get wet, they get slippery.
That's the only liquor cracked him.

351
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,090
Oh that's it. That's it.
We're into the third round.

352
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,700
Okay.
Dominating a fight for three rounds.

353
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,830
Actually I don't know if he was dominating
the second cause we were talking shit

354
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,360
dominating a fight in the third round
for sure and still [inaudible] as

355
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,640
[inaudible] ago. He's a beast dude.
I'm telling you. You kaos everybody.

356
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:01,330
He's a beast. That was a weight
problems. A away problem.

357
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
Well he needs to hire like
a dolce. Get on it. It lets,

358
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,900
lets say you can't afford dolce. Let's
say dolce. Whose Guns Street? Hollywood.

359
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:10,990
You can't afford them. Who Do you go
with? An MMA? It's a very good question.

360
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:14,900
There's a void to be filled. Oh Nice.
Left Hook. Look at that stumble. Whom?

361
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,150
Oh Dude Dude. Ouch. Knockers obese man.

362
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,840
Fuck an angle for me to get into
nutrition. That's it. Joey Diaz.

363
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,830
Let's do it.
Don't worry about that.

364
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:30,100
And I'm going to drive you somewhere
nice just to, come on. Let's go down.

365
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,890
Joey is Linacre okay.

366
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,020
Fucking good tech to no he throws wide
shots but he's got a lot of weight behind

367
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,660
them.
Super wide in that situation.

368
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,210
He's a beast man. You don't want to be
credit by that guy. But you know what?

369
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:50,060
I think Dj's too fast. Djs
too fast. Too smart too.

370
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,420
He's not going to stand in
front of you like that. No,

371
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,560
it's going to be a totally different,

372
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,780
it'd be interesting to
see if Linacre can adapt.

373
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,210
If you think about the chance
in every division there,

374
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:01,890
the guy with the best defense,
a lot, think about it.

375
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:03,460
Most of them name all the champs.

376
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:06,130
Most of them have the very
best defense in [inaudible].

377
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,950
His cane have really good defense.
I am.

378
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,700
Saul came really get
caught to the junior fight,

379
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:14,080
did junior fight that can happen
to anyone. And then those fights,

380
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,840
what he got dropped by, um, Chuck Congo,

381
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,130
Congo hit him perfectly at like
six fights. But think about it now.

382
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,870
Like Junior dos Santos really?

383
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,770
We're not hearing a peep out of striking
against cane. Yeah. But nothing,

384
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,740
the cane thing. He got
dropped by by um, uh,

385
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,060
Chuck Congo, Congo and just immediately
shoots in and gets a double.

386
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,600
It's cause that's what's natural to them.
That's gotten me in trouble.

387
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:45,520
Like Frank Mir and I were talking about
this when Frank Mir fought Nogueira, um,

388
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,160
he got blasted with a right hand blasted,
right.

389
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:52,390
He's on Queer street shaking and his,
his kind of Plan B,

390
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,190
just his body automatically does it.

391
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,880
It shoots in and that's when he shot
in and then caught broke his arm here.

392
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,790
That would come around. No,
Garrett could have finished them.

393
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,540
I thought no guera went to finish him
because Nogueira wanted to make a point

394
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,120
because frank was saying something
about no Gareth's Jujitsu.

395
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,620
So he's not worried about new
Garrett's Jujitsu, numeric,

396
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,920
no new Garrels Jujitsu's kind of base.
And it went for that good team. Yeah.

397
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:13,601
And she won the,

398
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:17,980
what I had heard was that he wanted to
submit Frank Mir because of their first

399
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,380
fight, like to sort of prove
a point, which is great,

400
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:21,850
but you would've had an extra whatever,

401
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:25,150
225 k in the bank if he just
kept punching him like this.

402
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,870
It was literally over and me and frank
were talking about in the back and I was

403
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:31,480
like, that right hand man, I
go in the locker room. You're
that fucking right hand.

404
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:34,210
He goes, Bro, I got caught the
exact same way you did. He goes,

405
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,670
but you're a natural instinct
was sit there and swing.

406
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,250
My body just took over
and I fucking went in man.

407
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:44,430
Meanwhile that was like the
most devastating turnaround
and then sound or that

408
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,710
submission.

409
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,170
Frank Mir Noguera he broke his arm
in how at the top like you can see,

410
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:55,610
oh yeah. Brazilian cats are
especially no gears, no nuts happened.

411
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,140
Frank Mir I think greatest heavyweight
submission artists of all time,

412
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,310
it's hard to argue is definitely the
best bone breaker it take to, to,

413
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,990
to actually come back from an injury.

414
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,670
Like that depends if you
ever come back from it.

415
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,890
I mean Tim Silvia arguably
was never the same.

416
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,740
Tim Silvia arguably was never the same.

417
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:15,530
I mean he was always a big
right hand punch her, but
he had a real good left too.

418
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:17,930
And he had no real problems with that arm.

419
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:22,580
Like he thanked Herb Dean for saving his
career by stopping that fight cause he

420
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,940
was trying to keep going and try and
keep swinging cause just he's a champ,

421
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,260
you know? Yeah. But who knows. Only he
knows only he knows how the effectors are.

422
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,490
Only Nogueira knows how
that arm affected him. Beat.

423
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,070
He had affected him for a long time.

424
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:36,980
He had to postpone a fight because his
recovery was not going as quickly as he

425
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:40,820
thought it was. A lot of guys are
crazy. The loudest I've ever chaired.

426
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:45,380
His win for someone who's not a
friend or a teammate is for Frank Mir.

427
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:46,550
When he flopped Brock Lesnar,

428
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,410
I wanted to beat Brock so bad because
I didn't want Brock to come from WWE

429
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:52,580
playing grab ass,

430
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:55,820
make all this money and just
stroll over and just destroy catch.

431
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,180
Which is what he was cheering for him
when he got him in that ankle lock.

432
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,830
Oh yeah. And he got beat by Jitsu.
Yeah. Favorite fight of all time.

433
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,040
But it was the one a bat,

434
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,590
the one of the worst taps ever because
the referee was just not on it, man.

435
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,280
He just didn't get on a quick
enough fucking Mazza Gotti.

436
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,330
You're a heavyweight and see Mazda. Yeah,
for sure. But you're like damn son this.

437
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,450
He's a good to have my head.

438
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:22,451
On a swivel on that mental lapses that
you can't have and when you got a guy

439
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:27,410
like Frank Mir yanking on
your fucking knee bone, yeah,

440
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:30,920
you better watch your p's and q's.
Gotta Break Pencil Yard. Yeah. God,

441
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,760
that'll just take out
your destroy your did.

442
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,150
He broke Tim Silvia's arm in a weird way.

443
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,650
Like he had the elbow like he was
real low down on the, on the arm bar.

444
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Frank Mir frustrates me. Frustrates me.
What am I? Literally we talked about it.

445
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:45,260
One of my favorite guys,
Bro.

446
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:48,980
If I'm Frank Mir and I got those nasty
leg locks and all this shit and I'm

447
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,160
fighting Daniel Cormay, Josh
Barnett, whoever you though,

448
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:55,790
Josh is a beast on the ground.
I'm jumping to half guard son.

449
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,570
I'm going for your fucking legs because
most guys aren't no matter. Let's listen.

450
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:03,230
If you're fighting Frank Mir and you're
not a leg lock specialist and you're

451
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:07,100
like, God, I got three months to get
ready for it. That do just do what you do.

452
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,310
Forget about the fucking leg locks
cause he gets a hold of you in trouble.

453
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,360
You're just in three months.
You want to know basic to teach.

454
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,730
You don't think everyone
he trains with knows basic.

455
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,410
But if you're Frank Mir is train partner,

456
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:21,560
you're like yeah I know some shit on the
ground with my legs because I trained

457
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:24,740
with frank and he's still, he's
adapting that and catching them. Right.

458
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:29,360
So then you go into the fight and you
get caught in this complex ankle lock and

459
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:32,210
your defendant with the first
basic defense cause you're not,

460
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,810
it isn't that assuming that you
really deeply caught though.

461
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,720
I mean there's a lot of the defense's
catching it before it ever gets back for

462
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:41,900
sure. I mean if you've got to know it
gets caught. I mean if he catches it,

463
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:46,500
you're right. It's a good attempt by,
but you should know like basic defense.

464
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:49,380
Like he got it done that fast
before you took the truck.

465
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,190
If you got three weeks you can improve
your basic defense quite a bit.

466
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,270
Oh there's Trevor Whitman.

467
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:01,500
So what you're telling me all the fucker
you're fighting Ronda than too much.

468
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,233
I know.

469
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,530
I know from being a moron that
if she touches my fucking wrist,

470
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,710
you got to know what she's doing,
what she's doing.

471
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,280
So you could maybe like look at me.
She'd take me,

472
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,090
she held it off till the third round.

473
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,060
You know the only reason why she held
it off cause she knew what was going on

474
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:22,510
and me shirt submission artist herself,
Michelle hired uh,

475
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,010
a teammate of Rhonda is who did,
Jude owns known for arm bars.

476
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,270
Rhonda was very hurt by it.
Yeah.

477
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,170
Hired someone who was on the team with
Ryan or they were in the same circle to

478
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:34,700
brought her in and she was like, yeah,
if you pay me I'll help you out his side.

479
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,450
Defend Rondo's Armbar wow. Wait a piss
up. Wait a fricking poke. The bear.

480
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,990
Rondo's like what? Fuck Your
Armand poked the bear. Yeah. That.

481
00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:44,710
Enjoy that.

482
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,710
That is the last bit you want your
weight class when she hit Alexis Davis,

483
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:55,161
is that right hand knee to the body and
then who hip toss full weight on her

484
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,750
right. Boob lands into side
Mount Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang,

485
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:03,180
Bang. I love it. That's how, that's
how you know the rest of the bitches.

486
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:07,770
They're like, who else wants some? No,
no, you're good. No one wants. Well,

487
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:11,220
cats and Gannon said she wants a fighter,
but yeah, like like two weeks later.

488
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,660
I know. I'll find her not, I
have this fight though. What?
We'll figure it out. Yeah.

489
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,900
No Shit. Heavyweights,
heavyweights, Sonia.

490
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:23,370
It's not got you look on Twitter it the
number of fucking 45th rank guy in the

491
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:27,030
world's calling canine girls. They're
like, no, we're cool. You got this girl

492
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,730
all the fucking movie premiere,
right? They buy all their tickets.

493
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,390
What's with scary about her is she's
getting better and she's way better than

494
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:39,990
everybody else and she's getting better.
Every time she fights, he's better.

495
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,500
The fucking Sarah McMahon fight
boom knee to the body takes her out.

496
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,870
Ever seen that? Just crushed our
crusher with the need of the body.

497
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:49,440
This fight catches it with a right hand
and then perfectly placed in need of the

498
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:54,390
body and then a hip toss about as good
as you've ever seen in the UFC was broke.

499
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,660
Damages neck. Yeah. Everyone's
like, oh my God. Rhonda said,

500
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:00,810
I guess that she was out like when she
was thrown and she could tell that she

501
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:01,644
was limping.

502
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,490
She so she had probably got knocked out
by either the punch or the need of the

503
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:09,510
body sometimes makes you just go limp.
Because if I am correct,

504
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:11,940
I think she hit her with a left knee,

505
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:16,320
which is like a left hook on that
side of your body. However liver shot.

506
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,710
So she probably brutalize her.
Shuts your whole system.

507
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,520
Pickpockets, Puerto Rican, pickpockets,

508
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,480
looking at shit. Fucking
town. Are you fucking crazy?

509
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,323
Atlantic city.

510
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,910
The best fight and that fucking caught
is the one after the fucking on the

511
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:38,900
boardwalk. Fuck. Hey,

512
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,450
what do you think about this possibility
that Gina might sign or that Holly Holm

513
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,760
is gonna find her next? Uh, Holly
Holmes not going to find an neck.

514
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,880
Holly Holm said she wants
a couple more fights for,

515
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:53,570
she takes on Rhonda and Rhonda is
the Mike Tyson effect man who won.

516
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,680
Who else wants some of Rhonda, right?
Who else wants some a depot. It was like,

517
00:29:56,681 --> 00:30:01,300
now we're good now bitches.
Cause before bits were like,

518
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,290
well I'll be the main event championship
fight on. We have all these cameras.

519
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,730
Not if he lasts eight seconds,
bitch. No one remembers you.

520
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,370
You gotta hang in there like
Liz Carmouche. We're out
with her in Vegas. Yeah,

521
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,030
it all. Anyone came up and talked her
about was her fight with Ronda? Yup. Ah,

522
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:19,780
you almost had her those
course. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

523
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,900
Well that's always what happens too
when someone is like this super dominant

524
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:23,530
person.

525
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,530
It's like people are waiting to see them
lose their waiting to see him get beat.

526
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,470
That's the number one reason why
people go to a Floyd Mayweather fight.

527
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,140
Just want to see him lose. Yeah.
If there was like a percentage,

528
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,220
like how many people are
here to see Floyd loses?

529
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,130
It's probably like 40% we all were hate
her in the crowd here and they all have

530
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:42,370
his team money.
Mayweather. I saw him once.

531
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,790
I saw him once after that fucking laugh.

532
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:47,080
16 but you won't see Joe Silva for months.

533
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,090
They got him with a briefcase in the
neighborhoods. They got him in Africa,

534
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:53,760
they got him in England.
What are you talking about?

535
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,120
The book or after fucking
Rhonda. Oh, beat the hell out.

536
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,350
And they just took them on
Monday's meeting, Joe Silver.

537
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,550
You're gonna load long fucking trip long.

538
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,600
You've got to go find some fucking body
to fight this chick this time you got to

539
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,880
go somewhere deep in the
jungle somewhere deep.

540
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,890
But what's interesting about
the Gina Carano things,

541
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:16,030
if the Gina Carano does fight
that she's gonna fight her first.

542
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,320
That's how it should be,

543
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:21,190
because that's what Gina Crown has one
fight to make her career relevant and

544
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:23,710
acting yet.
So she gets one fight against Ronda.

545
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,700
They publicize the shit out of it.
Rhonda likes Gina. She's a fan,

546
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,000
so she's not going to,
you know,

547
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,240
she's not going to rip her
head off if someone said,

548
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:33,640
Yo girl getting most of the
girls out there said, hey,

549
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,580
you got to fight Ronda Rousey. Just
let her arm bar. You get like a male.

550
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:38,110
It's all good.
She's not going to hurt your face.

551
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,770
She's going to body slam you on your
back and then she's gonna break your arm.

552
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,590
But you just gotta tap early. You can get
a nice meal. You know what I'm saying?

553
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,460
Every chicken heads like Yo,
hell yeah.

554
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,170
Chicken and walking out with their
black belt around their neck.

555
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,450
Did Gina is going to have a
hard time making 40 35 no, no.

556
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,620
She's going to hire a professional.
She was never known for work ethic.

557
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,940
You know what I'm saying?
So now I think she's going to give it,

558
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:01,300
it lit a legit go.
She does fight.

559
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,660
Ronda striking is pretty
legit, isn't it? Yeah.

560
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:06,250
It doesn't matter what the fuck she does.

561
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:08,320
I'm telling you it's
going to last one round.

562
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,260
Hofi lasts longer than the
last grow at 16 seconds.

563
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,230
So we at least get to see some of it.
You know what I'm saying?

564
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:19,270
But just get in shape and
show up. Tap Out, get your
jacket. Go have some fun here.

565
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,560
Just saying call big brown. You know
what I'm saying? I'm a good time.

566
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,620
So you're, you're giving her, you're
giving her just the first round.

567
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,070
You're saying that that's how dominant.
You kidding me. No time in a fight.

568
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,260
No.

569
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,370
They should be like [inaudible] versus
the guy who made his burrito come check

570
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:36,961
it out and it's,

571
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:40,310
it's like it's not going to last
because she's been out so long or just,

572
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:43,040
it's just a different level.
It's a different level.

573
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,220
What are we talking about
that Alexis Davis is a beat.

574
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,630
Let me say what about this?
What about juice to the tits Cyborg

575
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,720
when she was out of bed to the tits?
Uh,

576
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,250
I think Cyborg when she was at her
best. That's a tough fight. Yeah,

577
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,970
it's a tough fight. Cyber could hit
really hard. Cyborg making really Cyborg.

578
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,870
Cyborg, making one 35 with strict
testing, going to get eight the fuck up.

579
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,660
That's one 35. Which trick testing
is a little bit problematic.

580
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,190
I'd like to go back in time to the pride.

581
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,370
She was one 75 and she would whoop my ass.
What are we talking about?

582
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,390
Tina? She's, she was
telling me she was terrible.

583
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:28,400
The picture up there was a picture of
her from behind and her husband Cyborg,

584
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,270
you know,
and her back is roughly as wide as it was.

585
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,930
She slimmed down considerably.
I've got a lot of respect for her man.

586
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:40,730
She told me she fought that a kickboxing
Muay Thai chick who nobody wanted to

587
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:44,450
fight for three years and Cyborg fodder
I think in like her fourth fight or

588
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:45,284
something like that.

589
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,440
And even though she doesn't look like
physically the same when she was like

590
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:52,130
super intimidating, scary. When
she fucking with Ron and Wanda,

591
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,450
she looked like Vandelay with some
corn rows. Yes. Yes. She doesn't.

592
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,810
She looks much more womanly now, but
she's still a beast. She's still,

593
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:03,050
she lost interest. Yes, she did.
Super. But I'll tell you what, man,

594
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:06,470
she got cracked in the first round. She
got front, kicked in the face and dropped.

595
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:09,140
She got up and she came
after this chick man.

596
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,700
The chick was still going after her.

597
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:14,630
I mean it was a wild ass fight scene
and the woman she fought is so legit.

598
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:18,410
She hasn't been able to secure a fight in
three fucking years. Wow. She's really,

599
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,740
I would still rather watch Misa,
Miesha Tate fight even.

600
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:26,660
She can lose six in a row. Cool. Yeah,
she's attractive. Wow. Rhonda Rabbit. Yep.

601
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,070
Brennan. I know what I'm saying. Ronald.

602
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,590
Gina Carano verse Ron would be the
biggest women's fight ever. Why?

603
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,350
Because they're both hot. It's what
we all want. That little thing.

604
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,300
Turn the lights on them. Get sweaty.
When are we taught that? Listen,

605
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:46,040
I am a hardcore fan. I will watch cyborg
fight. Anybody. Every time she's fighting,

606
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,170
I'm watching.
I watched her invicta fights.

607
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,900
I'm going to watch and she fights at
one 35. I think she's a bad ass fighter.

608
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,300
I think she really,
she's a beast man.

609
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,410
I'm just saying if you gave me my pick,
I would pick these other girls.

610
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,360
I actually don't agree with you on that.

611
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:04,220
I like watching the most skilled fighter.
UFC knows they have a problem.

612
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:05,330
We got to come up with no money.

613
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,990
Well I think if there's anybody that's
got a chance, it might be sidebar. Listen,

614
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:10,930
they've got to come up with
next for fucking girls.

615
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:16,030
If cyborg can comfortably at the
same time. That's two years. Uh,

616
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,730
it was funny cause yeah, she'll
take on the top pitcher. If I'm,

617
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,060
if I'm fucking Tom Rhonda as advisor.

618
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,290
I'm saying you fight two more times and
we're out gas. Where are we going to?

619
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,160
We're going to wait around until they
find some monster working out and fricking

620
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,710
Bruce has got to be some flyer up gold
medalists right now that are sitting

621
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,810
around some judo people that
are sitting around right now.

622
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:38,430
They're seeing the money she's making,
which has been able to do for sure.

623
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,840
It's gotta be some wrestlers.

624
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,750
They're all coming up and say shit
about them putting together a career and

625
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:45,570
getting to a position where
they can actually challenge
her and not just jumping

626
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:48,540
right into the lion's mouth.
Cause anybody, she may be, Gosh,

627
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,140
she's going to be out before that happens.
I think I know that. I don't think so,

628
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:54,390
dude.
I think she likes beaten bitches ass.

629
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,960
I think it's just going to stick around.
I think she's going to stick around.

630
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:00,550
She enjoys it, man.
She's too good to stop.

631
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,640
Was saying stop and next week maybe
three or four, maybe two more.

632
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,330
You got to realize she's been doing
judo since she's a kid. Her body's not,

633
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:13,380
you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Well,

634
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:16,380
she's got a little bit of knee surgery
she's about to do right now. She'll be,

635
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:20,820
she did it. Uh, I think so. They cleaned
it up. Scope the knee. But listen man,

636
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:23,700
she's too good to stop.
She's revolutionary. Good.

637
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:26,230
She's redefining combat sports for women.

638
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,560
She stopped right now
it's just a straight man,

639
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,880
but she's still getting get
better, man. She gets paid.

640
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:34,620
She's still gonna get paid a lot
of money on. She's so gigantic.

641
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:37,180
I don't think she's going to stop.
I think you're crazy. I think

642
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,770
she's going to stop. You
think should should uh, I
think after three fights. Wow.

643
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,560
Would you stick around and wait for what?
Till they find a monster to beat you.

644
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,750
But is that what she's doing? She
stopped with her kids and she stuttering.

645
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,880
How long are you going to
wait? I need more money. Oh,
in her movie careers. Boom.

646
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,710
And she's also been pretty vocal about
the fact that she is going to retire

647
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:02,850
sooner than later. How should
been at least ted? So on
my podcast, it's, you know,

648
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:06,540
she, she's been pretty, you mean,
you mean our pocket? Oh, no.

649
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:11,560
Even mind the went on when I did it on
that on Brian Calco. I didn't know Brian.

650
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,630
Brian thoughts,

651
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,990
mother fucker call this show man
for awhile I had to talk to him.

652
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,110
Joseph just call it Brian Calley.
Brian Cowen show.

653
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,330
I shouldn't even named my
show the Joe Rogan experience,

654
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:27,990
but I just did it cause I'm a Jimi
Hendrix fan cause you see the Jimi Hendrix

655
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,430
mugshots behind me. I just named
it that just for, you know,

656
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:37,170
it was a goof. You know we, we
had a laptop with snowflakes.

657
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:41,210
Yup. John proctor. Oh Massachusetts boy.

658
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,490
Those dudes like the fight.
Which one?

659
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:48,510
Which would proctor the Salus.
Ooh,

660
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,720
that's thrown at pencil.

661
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,830
Quincy mass in the house.

662
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,730
I'll make sure you make sure your
tweet for me. I'm going to be at the,

663
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:02,670
you know West Palm. Him. You
don't do it for yourself. Come on.

664
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,520
Tom's is finding that tells me a tweet
for him and I check his page and he

665
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:09,270
hasn't tweeted. I know. It was like, hey
dude, you can't do that. So mad at me.

666
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:11,930
He's like, Hey asshole. He
asked me to you and he has,

667
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:15,150
he done it and it's at my traps like
I pray, I'm like, oh, it didn't go.

668
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,890
So like for instance,

669
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:21,000
August 1st I'm going to be at the ace
theater in downtown La with Joey and

670
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:24,210
Dunkin and we've been tweeting that
shit for weeks. I've been tweeting,

671
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,500
I've been doing Instagram and tweeting.

672
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,030
You've been doing some of those Instagram
videos, but you are off on Twitter. Hey,

673
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:32,970
by the way, for real. It's
not so bad. I was like,

674
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:36,340
you need to tweak this out please.
So you open the life map

675
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,860
Brendan or Hashtag phone
the kid what we use.

676
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:42,790
He just puts Brandon's really funny,
this one. And then put a link.

677
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,640
Everyone's like, what the fuck
I gotta I gotta learn how to do.

678
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:49,390
I'm really Ketel one. Learning. Sure.
Learn. Pay attention a little. Listen.

679
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,540
Do you have a fucking iPad for a phone?
I know

680
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,550
you didn't give us any love
for the picture that we
Instagram where I'm jumping

681
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:01,660
in the air. I did you get a text back?
No, I didn't. I did send it to you.

682
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,120
I send you a text back you big time.
Yeah,

683
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:09,250
I think I text back Hahahahahaha
but I was in Hawaii.

684
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,440
Somebody was like flying squirrels. We
got all kinds of things. Some funny,

685
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,990
it's not rape if you swim surprise. I was
impressed with what you write. I didn't,

686
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,800
I didn't. You thought, Huh?
That works for me though. Yeah.

687
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,030
Sexy man.
I want to tell you one time me,

688
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,140
I want to thank America for all
the comments about my shorts. Yeah,

689
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:33,730
you were jumping pretty high. Our
friend who took that picture literally,

690
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:34,980
I was like, hey, take this picture.

691
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:38,820
Just fools about the blows up asshole
out jumping on the beach. So they, they,

692
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,360
he jumped and she got it in one snap and
I was like, let me see that. Hi Mike.

693
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,750
Brian, get over here.
I was like, oh my God,

694
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,150
perfect shot sun reflecting
off my pitch and chest.

695
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:51,850
Did you run in jump or did
you like sort of, but I felt,

696
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,670
I remember about 40 yards. I remember
I fell. I was like, I feel I go, I go,

697
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:57,520
I'm going to jump high cause I used to do
all his demonstrations and Tae Kwon Do.

698
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,610
I go, I want to jump really high
demonstration. I took ballet,

699
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,170
I took ballet for two years in theater
school and I did you even admit that I

700
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:08,770
will and I, why can't it just be a
cool picture? Nope. Gotta keep going.

701
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:13,890
Gotta push it and a Leotard for two
years and I could jump a leotard.

702
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,870
Yes, I did. You're kicking. Uh,

703
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,780
well I had been doing taekwondo
so actually could do all the,

704
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,750
I could do all the jumps and stuff. Like,
you know, I can, if you can do a jumping,

705
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:27,610
we'll kick. You can do a tour. Shah Tay in
the air. What's that? You guys Google it.

706
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,880
You Tay? Yeah, it's called [inaudible].

707
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,790
How many times have you had a girl say
yes because you could say towards j and

708
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,890
she's like,
let's just give it to me.

709
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,580
I had sex with all the girls in my ballet
class. Don't have to sell all of them.

710
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,970
Oh my God. I was a young man. They
probably thought you were confused.

711
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:46,030
They were trying to fuck
you back to straight around.

712
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,160
You have to wear a dance belt,

713
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:50,290
which is essentially a thong
and a cloth around your,

714
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,510
what did your dad say when he
said you want to do ballet?

715
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,200
My Dad to the ballet fan is he?
My Dad signed me up for it.

716
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:59,740
He's a ballet and opera fan. Him. If Mike
had told me that like damn little dude,

717
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,580
I was so good. It was a very, I was, I'm
more I, I should've been a ballet dancer.

718
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,550
I'm bill for it. Are you
joking? I'm being dead serious.

719
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:11,110
I was a natural get the fuck. I was a
natural. I could do four pirouettes.

720
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,800
I'm not kidding.

721
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,740
How weird is this Jack Daniels
commercial for fucking Frank Sinatra?

722
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,040
What a Frank Sinatra was alive.
He'd be like, hey Yo, yo, yo,

723
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,610
what the fuck are you doing? What are
we doing in my songs and my pitch jog.

724
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,240
We'll fucking sold me here.
Who Sold?

725
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,660
No one's making bank though
for Sinatra was alive.

726
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:31,710
Him doing a Jack Daniels
commercial fuck snap on its face.

727
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,100
I think Elvis made more when he was

728
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,130
dead after was dead from all the
songs than they did when he was alive.

729
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:41,150
And Christopher Walken wrote a
one man show about it, called him.

730
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,860
That was Joey's theory on a
Michael Jackson. Yup, he is.

731
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,550
What's up Michael Jackson
is making more money now.

732
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,690
Jackson was dead when he was
alive. He was broke. Yup.

733
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,900
And the day he died, his stock look it
up. Yup. He's made more this year than,

734
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:02,150
Whoa, look at that logo. No. Oh my
God. Oh No. Ain't that a bitch though.

735
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,380
Let's sucks, man. Making all
that money after you're gone.

736
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:09,080
I guess it helps the family up.
What's going on with that thing?

737
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:11,540
Is that a hematoma and that's just
what happened to my cheek, bro.

738
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:14,300
Everyone's like, oh, you broke your
jaw. Nah Man, let's he headbutted me.

739
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,880
My cheek swelled up like
a bumblebee stone. Yeah.

740
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,930
I thought you had a broken jaw for sure.
No Sir. Flourishing now back to training.

741
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,250
Powerful. Powerful. Brendan washing
pro Joe proctors face looks crazy.

742
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,820
It's got a mouse live in near his ear.
Dude.

743
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,050
Is that moves towards is either going
to stop trouble cause he really,

744
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,440
it's one of those, one of those
are New Guinea. Super Damon's.

745
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,230
It is cause in a burst in your eyeball.
Oh Shit.

746
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:37,700
He's already hitting that same spot.

747
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:45,870
I guarantee he made a couple of
fucking cop 100 million Mj last year,

748
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,390
2013 earnings from Michael Jackson.

749
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,760
Garen Filthy Rich,
Huh?

750
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,040
And when he died it was all a scam.
It was all a dream.

751
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,850
He owned like the fucking man.
You could see something coming.

752
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,620
Remember they started putting the
Beales back on iTunes. It was a big,

753
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:10,160
I was scanning. He owned the
fucking things. He was in debt.

754
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,460
They were losing his shit.
Paul Mccartney did the super bowl.

755
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,620
All of a sudden he came back at 67 like
he needs any fucking money that he made

756
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:23,480
$125 billion last year.
Made over 700 in the last five.

757
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:28,220
Oh my. He's got 700 million.
I'll trade spots with him. Right?

758
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,230
Why wait?
His kids wouldn't mind having his money.

759
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,503
He's dead.

760
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,660
His kids are living in like
fucking doctors show Jacksons
live in like a dock to

761
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,510
doc the oh that's so funny.
They were all living like fucking doctors.

762
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,300
Unbelievable.
125 million.

763
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,850
It's weird that you could sell
someone shit after they're dead.

764
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,190
It almost kind of seems
like when you're dead,

765
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:58,550
all your artwork should be free today.
Interesting looking referee.

766
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:01,410
He's got those corn rows. I'm trying
to figure him out so it looks like,

767
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,940
you know what? He looks like the
female fighter in million dollar baby.

768
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,190
What would you do, Brian? If you, uh,

769
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:10,490
if you were going to die and you
had like a long career behind you,

770
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:13,840
your kids are all full grown,
everybody's healthy and you,

771
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,810
you had this idea that when you
died you're going to be like a more,

772
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:22,170
more valuable than you are alive.
Like what? Like Michael Foundation,

773
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,860
I'd set up a charity, a foundation. Um,

774
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,960
but just but a charity that training
like a school that trained like I go like

775
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,890
to set up schools and like the
way Andre Agassi did it in the

776
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,030
inner cities and stuff.

777
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,190
Cause you remember the shit that was
going down with Michael Jackson's kids?

778
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:38,760
Joey? No. Yeah, there was some
shit where Michael Jackson's kids,

779
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:41,040
his mom was missing.
Remember his mom was missing

780
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:43,973
and the kids,

781
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:48,990
they are having a hard time
because everybody knows
that they're like in line to

782
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:50,010
inherit that money.

783
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:55,650
Imagine you have that whole 700
million just giant group of people,

784
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,570
whoever it has a vested interest in
that just hovering over that honey pot.

785
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,760
That is the Michael Jackson
estate. Yeah, but seeing his kids,

786
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,140
his kids are going to get massive dinero
like forget about a career like those

787
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:11,490
kids like oh damn proctor cracked
and what that left proctor, my wind.

788
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:14,890
This even with that crazy Hema
tomia bro. So here's, here's,

789
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,850
here's what we need to learn from this.
As you need to fake your death,

790
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,810
start making some bank. That's where
the money's at. But you can't enjoy it.

791
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,850
It isn't. You have to have to be
questioned though. Like what would you do?

792
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:27,810
How would you say you heard him
again? Oh, he's messed up, man.

793
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,910
He's really fucked clothes.
That's it.

794
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,460
Let's Damn Joe proctor with a
mouse grown out of his head.

795
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,930
Let's do something else with
Massachusetts son make. Last year,

796
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,430
Jamie would have to pack, make
5 million, 3 million, 3 million,

797
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:45,990
$5 over the course of his death.
He's probably made a shitload.

798
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,600
Now can they stick out?
This is gonna sound weird,

799
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:50,760
but can they stick a needle
in that drain that yeah,

800
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:54,000
they're going to have to
drain it for definitely. Yeah.

801
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,430
When you don't dream blood like that and
it pulls up and calcified, that's when,

802
00:45:57,431 --> 00:46:01,050
when you get cauliflower ear, I've
got a piece on my knuckle, ma'am.

803
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,090
I got this one knuckle,
it hurts like hell.

804
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:06,360
Every time I punch the bag it's
because I caught myself, my,

805
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,770
my knuckle and then I taped it up.

806
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:12,260
I wrapped it up but blood got underneath
it and it like calcified. Ouch.

807
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,820
And now I've got, it's
weird. It's just weird not,

808
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:18,570
I have like right on this knuckle on
his finger and whenever I hit the bag it

809
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:22,380
takes me like hertz, two rounds before
it stopped hurting after get numb it up.

810
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:26,310
So I just slap it in there until
he risk problems. Not Anymore.

811
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,630
I got um, some of that, uh,
prolotherapy on my wrist.

812
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:32,760
I used to have a big risk
problem with this dean. This, uh,

813
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,960
this right wrist are herded,
um,

814
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,630
kickboxing like 1989 and
it was bad to like 2002.

815
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,580
My fucked with me until
I got for prolotherapy.

816
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,120
I don't do anything for it, dude.
Prolotherapy is the shit I need to though.

817
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,840
So I get it on my neck and it worked.
Oh yeah.

818
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:55,230
Prolotherapy I did it for three
treatments and it works for reals.

819
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,360
Prolo is great. I'll show you the place.
Anything that got like tendon issues,

820
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:05,310
insurance covers, shoes. I don't believe
so. My neck was, my neck was a bunched up,

821
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,190
like really? How long ago was this
point where I got an x ray on it.

822
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:13,170
These are the injections with a though
we're talking about Germany. No, no, no,

823
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:18,090
no, no, no, no, no. Shit. Oh, that's
what I'm looking for it. No, I'm good.

824
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:21,930
Yeah, on the, yeah, that's the
best. Yeah. Regena keen. So Shit,

825
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:24,270
I'm going tomorrow if you want
to go with me. Really? Yeah.

826
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,030
I'll tell you when we get off this
thing. Doing it for your neck. No, no.

827
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:29,000
I'm doing it for my knee and my shoulder.
I'm doing it.

828
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,190
Anytime something even bothers

829
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,890
me, just go in there and just go
in there and they just inject it.

830
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:36,220
I just take some blood and yeah, I've,
I've so far I've had my knee done.

831
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,230
If I had my thoracic spine done twice
and I had my cervical spine done once,

832
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,810
I'm just going to have him give me the
one [inaudible] out of me. They're like,

833
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:46,960
dude, swoop hook. And most people can't
afford it. You stop talking about it.

834
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:50,740
What's a Miracle Cure? It's still a
Miracle Cure. All right. Whatever it is,

835
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,060
the shit is fantastic. So what of they
do? What's the whole process? The process,

836
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:57,850
which I don't shit looking all sexy.

837
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:04,330
They take blood out of your body and then
they spin it in a centrifuge and heat

838
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:08,420
it up. And when you heat it up, it like
gives your blood of fever. And this is,

839
00:48:08,421 --> 00:48:11,870
I'm obviously giving you a very
layman's version of what happens,

840
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,550
but your body creates this
anti-inflammatory response
to that heat and then

841
00:48:16,551 --> 00:48:19,730
that's in the blood and it manifests
itself as this yellow serums and they

842
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:20,960
extract as yellow serum.

843
00:48:20,961 --> 00:48:24,140
They inject it directly into
any area we have inflammation,

844
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,770
like if you have a knee inflammation. For
me, it was my back and my neck, my neck.

845
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:31,340
I had a bulging disc to completely fixed
it. Hey, I won't. The whole process,

846
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,240
it took a while for me. It
took several months. Um, the,

847
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:39,770
the injections you space out, I space
them out. I had a two weeks' worth,

848
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,840
but then within three, four weeks
afterwards, it started feeling,

849
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,250
it felt good right away,

850
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:51,430
but better over time as the anti
inflammation aspect of that blood serum.

851
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,980
Slowly but surely brought
down any injury that I had.

852
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,190
And then within like months, it
felt way better. It's, it's amazing.

853
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,460
I was having some problems with my
need. Boom. Shot it up. Perfect.

854
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:03,900
Kick the bag like a fucking werewolf.

855
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,570
Now does it,
does kicks have,

856
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:10,560
I've shown everybody I know those kicks
on Instagram hanging in there and almost

857
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,370
half a century, 47 as
ops. I'm very hard kicks

858
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,410
Joe proctor. Tell let's
get rid of that. Can Yeah,

859
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:22,630
me neither time I got out
of here by eight. Come on.

860
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:27,520
Just some little standup and got a
little stand up. Just show up. Well,

861
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,930
well this weekend it's West
Palm Improv but uh, um, sorry.

862
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,900
We knew there be three weeks at the
West Palm. I love it down. I love that.

863
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,380
Every fucking three. I love Florida
though. Fort Lauderdale, West Palm.

864
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:40,360
I don't you love Florida.
This is my favorite place to perform.

865
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:44,650
Probably Exact Canada.
They're wild. Yeah, I love it.

866
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,300
So the next fight is Rick story.
Motherfucker. Oh Shit. There you go.

867
00:49:51,301 --> 00:49:54,840
See the story in for up next,

868
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,720
this little bad little
fucking Barboza and Dunham.

869
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,330
After that we got to remember guys,

870
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,790
it's 10 30 and it said he's a savage
is these mother fuckers look it up.

871
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,980
Give me the white trash
out the green shirt.

872
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:14,110
That guy with the green shutters young go.
Yeah.

873
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,383
Fuck

874
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,190
brings back channels it and Brock Lesnar.

875
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,130
Have you guys seen this one

876
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,980
white cat that keeps challenging these
black heavyweight boxers and his shit.

877
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,360
Talkers keeps getting you the
troll. Fuck beaten out of him. Yeah,

878
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,360
he's a total troll,

879
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,790
but he's willing to put the gloves
on and actually get in there.

880
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:37,310
He got box a little bit.
He runs away with a body shot.

881
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:41,510
Last year I got drunk who dropped out?
He got annihilated by this dude.

882
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:43,370
Just some champ. This guy's like, what?

883
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,930
A wilder and wilder and then there's
another guy who just did it recently.

884
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:52,400
I didn't know he didn't get
another guy did it.

885
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,880
It chased him out of the ring. The guy
ran out of the ring. He dropped him,

886
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:56,481
got him on the ground,

887
00:50:56,481 --> 00:50:59,090
need him in the face and then beat him
down while I was on the ground till

888
00:50:59,091 --> 00:51:00,760
everybody pulled him off him.
Yeah.

889
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:03,170
He kneed him in the face and
be funny or is he just being,

890
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,970
he's an insane person getting famous off
of it. I mean, we're talking about them.

891
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,260
Oh boy. He's in the same person. He's
not good. It's not a healthy guy.

892
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:13,460
Poor fucker.

893
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:18,260
Just trying to imagine him wanting Deontay
wilder to punch you to Jesus Christ.

894
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,230
If that guy hits fucking
hard. Who's filming it? He
just brings his blades. Doug,

895
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,390
you have to film this because most gyms
I know that he would get beat up too.

896
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,400
I don't think he's filming it. You think
he's filming? I thought it was. Wow.

897
00:51:29,401 --> 00:51:29,990
There's no,

898
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,780
he has a homeboy filming it for sure
cause he cause then how's he getting the

899
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:36,370
footage and release it? Release it. All
this stuff. I didn't know he was Juliana.

900
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,420
I thought they were releasing it.
I don't think so.

901
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,790
I don't know cause otherwise why would
they keep it? You know what I'm saying?

902
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:43,780
Why would they release that?
Oh no,

903
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,900
because they just wanted to show everybody
this guy talks shit and then they

904
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:50,330
beat his ass.
I don't know if he's,

905
00:51:50,331 --> 00:51:52,170
I don't know who was just
speculating right now.

906
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:53,510
I don't know who I'm just saying.
I think it's,

907
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,620
he gets a homeboy who's down to and was
like, Yo, I need you to record this. Hmm.

908
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:03,560
I got to say this is bad that
I really want to say this. No,

909
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:07,040
I really want to say I like fun.
Let's all go. He looks great.

910
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,970
Let's go see this man. Let's go see this
on a huge screen. I buy him as Hercules,

911
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:15,710
as me, as to why I think that they
need to Redo Conan the barbarian again.

912
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:18,680
That James Moma guy was awesome.
He's perfect.

913
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:20,380
He's the best cone and of all times,

914
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:23,840
far as the way he looks and we know from
the game of Thrones and he's fucking

915
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:26,520
awesome. If you give them
a good script, Ripley's.

916
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,720
Somebody reads really good and he was
fantastic in the game of Thrones and he

917
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,700
was the best cone and of all time.
I'm sorry Arnold. You ever seen that?

918
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:36,440
He was the most,
I've never seen it,

919
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:40,900
but Arnold's the best ever seen her in
person. That not true. Johnny's not true.

920
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:45,860
Yeah. I met him. Giant man. Shoot. I
met him at the UFC is big. Very big.

921
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,910
Big Samoan man. Very nice guy.
Hawaiian is he Hawaiian? Yeah,

922
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,660
but my point being all, see, look
at that. That's some rock shit.

923
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,300
He did some rock shit.
This ridiculous.

924
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,540
Sampson doesn't move like
that raises eyebrows.

925
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:03,740
But Mama was the perfect Kona, the
greatest Conan of all time. No doubt.

926
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,790
I didn't turn on Swartz.

927
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,390
Pales in comparison because
Schwartzenegger was really good,

928
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:12,880
but he was still Arnold and
he had the beautiful mussels.

929
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:19,010
I read every book on and book,
man. I mean come to by Crum.

930
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:21,980
Crime does not care who you are.

931
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:27,210
Cross use chrome. It was
still Arnold. You know,

932
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:30,960
he still had that Austrian accent. Like
why does he, why is his accent different?

933
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,510
What is will Chamberlain doing in there?
What does he do it without?

934
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:39,530
White Broad Kane.

935
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,130
Motherfucking Velasquez.
How was the,

936
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:48,150
how was con powerful Brown pride that
with Johnny Mo? Was it good or no? No,

937
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:50,250
it wasn't good.
It was decent.

938
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:54,810
It was decent up until about halfway in
and then the ending was diggity diggity

939
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:57,540
dog shit unfortunately.
Cause I wanted a love.

940
00:53:57,541 --> 00:54:00,750
It kind of had a good moma guys.
Awesome.

941
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:05,070
I'm a huge fan of the original books.
The Robert E. Howard marks. Yeah,

942
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:08,670
I have all of those. I read all of
them, man. The playlists. Eight movies.

943
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:12,130
Haven't seen it yet. I haven't seen the
new one. The new one. It did really well.

944
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,800
We'll do AP for me if that's my
kind of movie though. But yeah,

945
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,840
that's why I would assume
you would like it. Scared me.

946
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:21,030
Want to watch them when there's not
as many people in the seats so I could

947
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:25,530
fucking spazzes out a little. It's a good,
it's a good movie though, as well. Done.

948
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,670
That's good. Cgi Sun. They
can do some shit these days.

949
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,430
They can do some shit.
I really can. You know,

950
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,280
that's why they had to remake Godzilla
even though they didn't even have a plot

951
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,230
there. Like fuck it. Look,
we can do what happens?

952
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:42,960
They fight this Japan shut up like the
fucking movie. But we have to have a plot.

953
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,400
I will get to that.

954
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:49,200
This is what I want gun Zilla do I want
him to open up another monster's face

955
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:53,280
and shit down his neck. What is
this money? Guardians of the galaxy.

956
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:56,260
Is this a comedy? It's
a marvel comics. Um,

957
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,570
series from raccoon. Haiti's. Yeah.

958
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:02,910
I supposed to take that seriously all
while they were 100% be that don't see

959
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:07,200
them. It was like right after star wars
when everybody was doing like these star

960
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:12,030
things, but that's a right
cope with guardians of the
galaxy. Oh, this fight son.

961
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,010
I can't wait this fight, son Matt
Brown and Brown, but he can't wait.

962
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,050
He's so tough. Is that San Jose?
Yes. So I'm going to be there.

963
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:24,240
That's on Fox.
On had brown is so rough.

964
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,850
This fight is going to
be fucking fantastic.

965
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:37,440
Can't wait for this fucking fight.
I got Lawler and I know you know me.

966
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:41,990
I never make pigs. If I was betting I
get Lawler. I think the styles clash.

967
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,640
You might be right. It just keeps
coming back. I don't know, man.

968
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:51,350
He just keeps coming. It might
be wrong too. I'll tell you what.

969
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:54,680
I watched that dude fight. Anybody
who wants a fight. Matt Brown. Yeah.

970
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,260
Both of them. Robbie Lawler too.
He's a psych. Go look at him. Go.

971
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:04,730
Oh Dad. Eyes do dad. Well, he's
calm as fuck when he gets in there,

972
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:07,100
man. I'll tell you what. When he
was fighting Jake Ellenberger.

973
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:10,820
I'd never seen a dude legitimately
smile because he was having a good time.

974
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,380
The way I've seen Robbie, it's hearsay.
It's a very bizarre psycho, real psycho.

975
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,790
He got taken down by Ellenberger and
he had his juicy smile on his face.

976
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:24,490
Like he wants to take me down
a beat and then he got back up.

977
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,260
Good Butterfly Guard, got back up to his
feet, just dropping bombs and be sick.

978
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:34,240
And Ellenberger came after him in the
third, the third. It was down in the car.

979
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:38,170
It's came after him. But man, Robbie
Lawler is a motherfucker right now.

980
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,070
Right now he is. Um, he's always been
great. Also the hardest hitter at one 70.

981
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:45,400
I think one of them, he's right
up there. But you gotta hurry.

982
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,480
Can't discount Hendricks. Can't discount
Woodley. You can't discount, uh,

983
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,840
Lombard Lombard can call rack for sure.

984
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:55,120
But if you looked at who has more
knockouts and all those guys,

985
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:58,570
you mentioned more fights too though, but
still more knockouts at a higher level.

986
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,060
Lumbar.

987
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,680
Do you know what did a lot of his fighting
at one 85 where I think he was just

988
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:04,750
out massed by a lot of people.

989
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:09,400
I think one 70 you're going to see
Lombard put some serious hurt on a lot of

990
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,600
bard is huge.
Lombard made me feel bad about myself.

991
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,490
He is Jack Super.
Jackie O is even more jacked than him.

992
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,270
Yo El Ramiro. Yup. You see Yoel
Romero and you go, okay, what am I?

993
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:25,360
Am I a little barn?
It's a cartoon and they trained together.

994
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:30,670
He's a hero. He's a superhero. I was
trailing me like shopping in the picture.

995
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,340
No, I'm cool man. That's right. Never
see me. My daughter has a waste.

996
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,330
It's only slightly smaller than Yoel.

997
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:42,331
Romero's and his potty blooms out
his greatest fucking triangle.

998
00:57:42,341 --> 00:57:45,520
Like a, like a terra
Dac Dolan. He's crazy.

999
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,900
Only person is as ridiculous with is a
shape is a Phil Davis True Phil Davis

1000
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:55,660
shoulders the most ridiculous with it.
Ridiculous.

1001
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:59,180
Like Tommy Hearns style for a two o
five pounder. Yeah. Y'All Ramirez.

1002
00:57:59,181 --> 00:58:03,690
He's so freaking, he said, did they
give Phil a fight yet? I do not know.

1003
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:08,950
I don't think so. I do not know. I don't
know. One of the good guys for sure.

1004
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,590
Great Guy. Great Guy.
Great Guy. Really Nice Guy.

1005
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,040
That rumble Johnson ferry was a tough
fight for him and he's doing that chuck

1006
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:16,270
man, horrible match. It was also,

1007
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:19,120
he's doing a lot of talking about
Jon Jones leading up to that fight,

1008
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:23,410
like trying to hype up a Jon Jones
fight. If he wins people, if you do that,

1009
00:58:23,411 --> 00:58:26,710
here's the problem. And if
you do have to win, don't,

1010
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,680
when people get really upset with you,

1011
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,860
they sit and they have a reason
to point at you. Like you,

1012
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:37,750
he was wasn't even paying attention.
John Jones, he looked past Phil.

1013
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,440
Phil Davis look past him.
You can't look past rumble at two oh five.

1014
00:58:41,441 --> 00:58:45,340
He's fucking terrifying.
Uh, yes. I just think,

1015
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:49,960
I think Phil Davis, uh, overall is
a better fighter. Just style wise.

1016
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:53,680
There couldn't be a bigger
nightmare problem wise match up.

1017
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:55,930
Then Anthony Rumble Johnson.
He might've been a better,

1018
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,270
he might be a better fighter than
what Anthony Johnson used to be.

1019
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,700
I don't know if he's a better
fighter than Anthony Johnson now.

1020
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,330
Cause Anthony Johnson now it's something.
Sorry. He's really coming into his own.

1021
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,590
If you watched the fight with
her lab scheme, you know,

1022
00:59:06,591 --> 00:59:09,910
he'd beat the fuck out of our loss. Gives
jobs round broke his jaw, dropped him.

1023
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,360
He looks sensational here. Sure.
And that was at heavyweight.

1024
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:18,370
We're talking about when you Saturday.
Yeah. Well he's a natural heavyweight.

1025
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:22,910
Almost 70 tried. Yeah, but
now he's down at two oh five.

1026
00:59:22,911 --> 00:59:26,300
My point being that he's just
a month Straw. Straight months.

1027
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:28,040
He's a month Stroh monster.

1028
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:33,260
How about him over him verse
globally fight. I love that fight.

1029
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:36,160
You're welcome Joseph.
[inaudible] he's got,

1030
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:39,320
I told you he's going to have a hard time
with Algeria in Hungaria was going to

1031
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:42,710
be a war. I think so too. But
who knows. It might not be,

1032
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,600
you know that power at two oh five could
be who? Jerry and Mike clip him too, man.

1033
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:51,230
Anything could happen. How Jira you
watch that fight? We, Rashad Evans,

1034
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:54,890
the only thing to worry about who Jiro
is, he, uh, pulled out with a back injury.

1035
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,410
He's been doing it for however.
That's what I'm saying.

1036
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:00,230
When you hear a guy like
say he had a back injury,

1037
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,390
like man back injuries are tricky.

1038
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,390
Like Lundberg is going through
a herniated disc. Matt,

1039
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,270
Matt Brown went through herniated disc.

1040
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,340
Like when you start
going through those man,

1041
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:15,240
a lot of those fucking come back coming
corona to retire because of it. Yep. Yep.

1042
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,430
He's suffered from it the entire time. I
know like me, Shit Man Nisha, it sucks.

1043
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:22,880
But you can get an ACL reconstructed
in a year later. You're good to go.

1044
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:27,050
Once you're fucking spine starts
giving out in certain spots,

1045
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,970
you do rehab, you strengthen it up. But
the problem with a lot of these guys is,

1046
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:33,410
look,
I've had a chance to take,

1047
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,570
obviously I'm older so I
don't recover as quickly,

1048
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:39,140
but I've had a chance to take
a full year off of Jujitsu.

1049
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:41,600
I want to train once in the last year,
only rolled once.

1050
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,560
But during that time it did nothing
but strength and conditioning.

1051
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:49,340
Nothing but kettlebells. Nothing but
like no yanking on my neck, no nothing.

1052
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:53,090
So now like everything is healed up
strong and everything is really good,

1053
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,540
but most guys were finding
don't have that opportunity man.

1054
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,630
They're back in the gym a couple of
months later you're going to have to work

1055
01:00:59,631 --> 01:01:02,360
through some shit and you'll just get it.
Like I talked to Matt Serra,

1056
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:05,810
Matt Serra fucked up his back before
he had a rematch with GSP. I go,

1057
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:06,890
what did you do about your neck,

1058
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,920
your back cause you fucked her
back up pretty bad. He's like, Bro,

1059
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:13,490
I couldn't fucking move. He was talking
about holding onto his back is like he,

1060
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,860
it was at,
at the end of training,

1061
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,880
he was demonstrating a move and then
something just gave out and he was just an

1062
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:23,570
insane extreme agony. So they
give him an epidural, you know,

1063
01:01:23,571 --> 01:01:27,680
an epidural just takes us,
it takes the pain away and you know,

1064
01:01:27,681 --> 01:01:32,510
x amount of months later he's
fighting GSP in Canada for the title.

1065
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,960
You know when you started
having guys come back from them,

1066
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:39,110
they come back from back injuries,
but you gotta be super careful.

1067
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:43,630
You don't make that thing a chronic issue.
Careful spinal cord kind of.

1068
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,970
I was reading about Benji Radek the other
day because I used to be a fan of my,

1069
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:52,550
I still am fan of Benji radic you
fought in the IFL good fighter.

1070
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,640
Straight towards good fighter and he had
an issue with his neck and a was so bad

1071
01:01:57,741 --> 01:02:01,490
that his pectoral muscle just
deflated down to the bone,

1072
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,850
his triceps and his pack. It
was from nerve damage. Yup.

1073
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,550
Just went down to the bone Chase's yeah.

1074
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,510
You're managing that he says and so he
had an operation he had to get when that

1075
01:02:11,511 --> 01:02:13,460
happened. Come back though. Yeah, he came,

1076
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:16,160
I don't know to what extent
where there was 100%,

1077
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,520
but it's certain came back slightly
at least. Um, but when you have that,

1078
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:24,180
you have a brief window when you start
getting like severe atrophy to anybody

1079
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:24,481
out there.

1080
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:27,300
This is really important because it
happened to a friend of mine recently. Um,

1081
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,080
one of Eddie's black belts, he had
a neck issue, is Armand atrophied.

1082
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,780
By the time he got to the doctor, the
doctor's like, you got to go into surgery.

1083
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,500
You have to get that opened up.
Like you can't allow it to go this far.

1084
01:02:36,501 --> 01:02:39,300
I can fix it though. No, that's
what the doctor said. He's like,

1085
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:41,160
he atrophied so much.
He's like,

1086
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:45,060
the odds of this coming back 100%
are pretty small. He waited too long.

1087
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,290
We waited like many months of it being
like completely atrophied where he's got

1088
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:52,590
one arm, it's like bigger than the other
arm, you know, and the doctor's like,

1089
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:54,000
your nerves are shut off.

1090
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:58,440
And the problem is when there's longterm
impingement like that, the nerves die.

1091
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,011
They die,

1092
01:02:59,011 --> 01:03:03,120
they don't come back and whatever you
do get back cause like really slow.

1093
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:07,960
So for sure when take that surgery,
right. Well you gotta know,

1094
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:11,880
you gotta take that surgery
to open up the, the um, the
area where the nerves are,

1095
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,550
what they do is they go into your,
your like your column where the, uh,

1096
01:03:15,551 --> 01:03:19,440
the nerves are and the open it up
so that your nerves have more room.

1097
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,020
So they're not impinged upon.
They usually, they call it,

1098
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:25,650
I think they call it a disectomy.
They cut some of the disc away,

1099
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:29,910
the impinging disk. What is
degenerative? Uh, what does that,

1100
01:03:29,911 --> 01:03:32,910
when I say yes, that's what
it is, is from impacts.

1101
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:35,950
Your disc gets smaller and more
smoke because they're made of,

1102
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:39,660
they're a spongy material. Yes. And
the way to combat that is first of all,

1103
01:03:39,661 --> 01:03:41,370
stretching and yoga are huge.

1104
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,860
Spinal decompression is
another one that's really good.

1105
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,740
Spinal decompression
is big, like a, those,

1106
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:49,070
those things that people do or they
hang by their ankles. They were

1107
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:51,810
really great.

1108
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,160
And I was showing Brendan this one that
I do with a kettle bell where I hang off

1109
01:03:56,161 --> 01:04:00,570
the thing real quick. Joe.
Super Flexible. Crazy flexible.

1110
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:05,140
Kind of weird. It's not weird. One
time we had a meeting and we were,

1111
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:08,280
we're talking about doing a show together
and in front of these exactly as he

1112
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:12,780
grabs both his ankles and pulls his
feet straight up, sitting on a couch.

1113
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:13,614
Do you remember?

1114
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:17,850
I don't know, style. I'd never
seen him. Literally I was like,

1115
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:21,660
what the fuck is he doing? And everybody
kind of was like, oh that's pretty good.

1116
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,830
I literally went,

1117
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,150
took both his legs like the way a
porn check we'll do and just went.

1118
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:28,921
And I was like,

1119
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:31,680
I'm flexible on the guy who finally
there was like a pause and the guy goes,

1120
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:33,990
how do you do that? He goes, I just
been doing martial arts my whole life.

1121
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:36,390
My body grew around, it grew
up. I was like, all right,

1122
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,520
well, good, good meeting. I don't
remember what the meeting was about.

1123
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:44,310
Eric Tanenbaum and some other people
and it was about us too in a TV show.

1124
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,590
Hopefully. Hopefully you
is this, how is the brand?

1125
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:51,300
That was 19 probably 98 stories.
Throwing.

1126
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,780
Sorry.
Heat stories of fucking brute.

1127
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:59,290
She's a thick kid. Yeah, he's a
brute and he's team take down. Right?

1128
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:04,110
And he's a training with a
Hendrix? I don't think so.
No, I don't think so. Oh No.

1129
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,280
Ooh. Oh. Oh Shit.

1130
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:13,950
He landed a hard left on my brush.
A little shaky.

1131
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:20,110
Yeah. Yeah. The lab on his trunk. So
that's with Ben Henderson, the joke.

1132
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,710
Crouch and Arizona. That's
a good spot. Great sweat.

1133
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,900
I love John Crouch to man.
Big Fan.

1134
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,240
Big Fan of Henderson to near. They're
producing some good fighters. Man.

1135
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,600
I liked what they did with Alex because
Sarah's, you know, he lost to, um,

1136
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:38,260
you're Ryan t right favor, but he
did a great job. It was a good fight.

1137
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,970
Most my most my fight, he was in over
his head. But that's a learning fight,

1138
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,110
you know.
I have favor.

1139
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:49,110
Didn't even start in the WEC until he was
a year older than Chris Harris is now.

1140
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:53,530
Yeah. Tough fight. But they matter.
Experience you. Ryan housing his son.

1141
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:55,690
How old is your item?
36 I believe.

1142
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:00,130
I want to say 35 36 how old is he?
You might be right.

1143
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,250
I Know Mitch reone just turned
36 to his birthday was yesterday.

1144
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:07,560
Shout out to Matt Mitrione.
[inaudible] Holla. He fought.

1145
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:12,160
He fought me. That's fighting that Louis
cat now. Huh? You see that Josie fighting?

1146
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:17,260
Oh, that big talking shit to each other.
Oh yeah. Matte for whatever reason,

1147
01:06:17,261 --> 01:06:19,390
when the crowd he stood up
and Derrick Lewis. Yeah.

1148
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,440
Kept giving Derrick Lewis the
throat slash oh really? Yeah.

1149
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:25,150
That's fools are fighting.
What do you think about that?

1150
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,860
I think Matt destroys him.
Yeah.

1151
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:32,090
He's gotta be minding his p's and q's in
the standing position. Mitre. Own. No.

1152
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:36,940
Michio can karate. Oh yeah. A kiddie
play in the NFL for six years.

1153
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:41,410
South Paul. He's king speed.
What? He's fast, dude. Watch that.

1154
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:43,660
Kimbo slice fight.
Everybody needs to watch that fight.

1155
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,510
If you forget what metric
and in front of him,

1156
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:51,670
that inside leg kick from the, from the
right hand stance be fight southpaw.

1157
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:56,680
He throws that snapping inside leg
kick and a nasty right hook. Boom.

1158
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,950
I think Louis is, I think it's too
much for Louis right now. Well,

1159
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:04,660
it's a big assignment, but I'll tell you
what man, Louis can bang. He hits hard,

1160
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:07,540
heavy hand for sure.
The ground and pound,

1161
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:11,860
his ferocious ferocious Rick
story working that arm triangle.

1162
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:15,460
I'm trying to go. I'm trying to go. I'm
triangle. Oh yeah. Keep that head there.

1163
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:18,250
Sign. Oh yeah. Nope. Lost the arm position

1164
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:24,130
so hard.
Rick story can bang man.

1165
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:28,540
I was so impressed with him taking all
those shots from Calvin gas slum and then

1166
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:29,860
catching them with that right hand.

1167
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:35,320
Cause Calvin was on fire in that fight
up until the point when Rick dropped him.

1168
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:42,130
There's a guy who needs to get
his diet in order, Bro. Yeah.

1169
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:45,370
That's one thing. UFC don't
mess with missing weight. Yeah.

1170
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:46,570
Nothing drives me more nuts.

1171
01:07:46,571 --> 01:07:49,900
Well he missed it the last time and
before that he barely made it on the

1172
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:53,350
undercard of the Hendricks fight. Barely
made this, that this the second time.

1173
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,310
What do you,
what do you get?

1174
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:58,180
Five and Calvin Gasland 20% 20% of your
purchase goes to your opponent if you

1175
01:07:58,181 --> 01:08:02,740
don't make the weight. Ooh, Rick Story.
Which yeah, beautiful use of the leg.

1176
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,600
Keep his opponent down a stronger man.
He's very strongly at this guy.

1177
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,700
He came in at 10th Planet One night.
Submit it everybody. Did he really? Yeah,

1178
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:12,900
he was strangling dudes.
Strang putting an arm trials,

1179
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:14,110
black belts and everybody just,

1180
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:16,220
well I don't think there's any
black belts there at the time,

1181
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,140
but you know, good guys. I don't
remember who it was. And he rolled with,

1182
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,470
but I remember Eddie was
saying to this guy is true,

1183
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,770
and this is before he fought, he was
to fighting in the UFC. Um, I want us,

1184
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:31,910
and it was about four years ago, three,
he's probably walks in 200 pounds, right?

1185
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:36,170
It's big boy. Big Boy
got an interesting style.

1186
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,230
A lot of body punches go.

1187
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,710
Remember is supposed to fight
Nate more cart and then Nate,

1188
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:43,870
whatever didn't get cleared because of to
supplement issues, testosterone issues,

1189
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:44,210
right?

1190
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:49,210
So then they put in Charlie men and then
c story had all that hype before that

1191
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:51,710
Charlie Brenneman goes in there
and beat them. Well, you know what?

1192
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:55,430
That's a weird fight when it's the
day of the fight and they change your

1193
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,880
opponent and you're the main fight of
the night and you've been preparing for,

1194
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:01,880
this dude is a wicked striker and you
think you're going to be doing some

1195
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:04,470
striking and then all of a sudden
Brennan man is going wrestling,

1196
01:09:04,471 --> 01:09:07,610
go piss in the fucking hanging on your
legs and you're just not prepared for

1197
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:11,180
that. It's tough, man. Yeah. But then
what do you do if you're Rick story like,

1198
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:14,480
Nah Man, I'm not taking, can't do
that. The OCC, we're going to be fired.

1199
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:18,970
Send it up your pool pole son,
straight up fighting again.

1200
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:21,350
What do we know?
Not only that,

1201
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:25,730
if you're a guy like Rick story and
your favorite above Charlie Brenneman,

1202
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,670
you're supposed to think you're going
to win that fight anyway. Right.

1203
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,740
He just was not prepared for that style.

1204
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:34,880
Which shows you how important game
planning is for specific fighters when it

1205
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:37,010
comes to specific opponents.
You know,

1206
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:40,610
he mean he's training for a guy like
mark [inaudible] and you better best

1207
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:42,920
believe that back when he
was training for Marquardt,

1208
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,110
everybody was scared of Marquardt.

1209
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:50,140
Marquardt was a mother fucker then and
he was a motherfucker at one 85 even

1210
01:09:50,781 --> 01:09:54,500
though he lost a child son and he was
still throwing bombs from his back

1211
01:09:54,501 --> 01:09:58,880
throwing elbows and still still
dangerous to the very end knocked out.

1212
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:04,820
He not the Martin Kampmann knocked
out Woodley and 70 at one seven yeah.

1213
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:08,220
That was afterwards. Actually.
That was after all this true.

1214
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,620
That was after you got to cut, cut to
strike. Force won the belt, knocked out.

1215
01:10:12,621 --> 01:10:17,060
Marvin camp man, he knocked out as
an absolute monster. He's a monster.

1216
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:21,250
Knocked out Damien Maia with one
punch. Countered is like, yeah, boom.

1217
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,670
We was just like doing a flying knee.

1218
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:27,100
How tallies ladies and put them on his
back and pounded them three rounds. Yeah,

1219
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,040
he, he's beaten some fucking
Wilson Govia beat. Beat him down.

1220
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,690
Nate Mark Card at one 85 was a
motherfucker back at 85 feet just to Huna.

1221
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,960
Huna.
I think the way this is too much man.

1222
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:43,770
It's just the way cuts just too much
for Nate. I think Nate is just like,

1223
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,910
no too hard. It's too, I
mean he did it with Woodley,

1224
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:51,590
but man he fought at one 85 for so long
and he was really good at that way.

1225
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,930
He's always going to have a
hard time with the wrestlers.

1226
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:57,140
When you get it elite level wrestle like
a guy like Jay all that could put you

1227
01:10:57,141 --> 01:11:01,610
on your back. Yeah. That chail
fight. He just went in with
a horrible game plan. He,

1228
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,240
he was,

1229
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,690
he was doing something the entire camp
and then the day of a certain coach told

1230
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:09,170
him to do something and there was this
flying knee and you need a land power

1231
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:13,040
shots, so that's why he's getting taken
though. I wonder. I wonder if Cheo,

1232
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,160
tell her what

1233
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,650
I mean. He No. Have you
got popped with EPO?

1234
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,350
I want to know how long you
been taking that stuff for him.

1235
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:23,940
He'd probably tell you as a first time
I ever tried it ever was the funniest

1236
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:27,810
thing. It was the day before and you'd
believe them. You talk to anybody. Dan,

1237
01:11:27,811 --> 01:11:29,970
you might be right, Doug.
I've never tried it before.

1238
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,730
Somebody told me I had to try to try to
figure when's this going to be out of my

1239
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:37,230
system? They said three weeks. I said,
I'm fine. So I took it. Here's my luck.

1240
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:41,370
Don't ever cheat.
Where have you heard from him?

1241
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:44,970
He's fighting to Metamorris or here's a
match. A minimum [inaudible] Jitsu match,

1242
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:50,190
which he lost his job on Fox.
Man, that's so harsh to me. Well,

1243
01:11:50,191 --> 01:11:53,840
it doesn't mean he lost it forever. It
means you lost it for now. He's so bad.

1244
01:11:53,841 --> 01:11:58,530
He's so good. I would chill.
Should do is he had a book, right?

1245
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:00,470
He does have a book, right? I don't know.

1246
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:04,980
Didn't he put out a book before this
came out? Put Up, put on another one.

1247
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:09,720
Just put on another one. Do it like
Lance Armstrong. Doug Armstrong. Yeah,

1248
01:12:09,721 --> 01:12:13,320
but tails different in that like he
never lied about it for long periods of

1249
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:15,650
times that sued people for you know,

1250
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:20,280
but it was kind of funny that he was
talking shit. I was talking about Lance,

1251
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:23,370
but I'm sorry I didn't want to delay but
rich story work on that left arm by the

1252
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:27,090
way. Portuguese look. He's got a good
Kimora man. He's got a good Kimora.

1253
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:31,680
The dude's got a role. Give up the back.
Oh, beautiful. Transition to the mount.

1254
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:36,990
Look how smooth that was, man. That
was like lightning mixed stories.

1255
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:40,590
Just just too much for this guy.
It's just to Straub with some beautiful,

1256
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:45,620
that amount was textbook
John Brown triangle triangle.

1257
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:48,750
Here it is. Oh boy. Yeah. This
is what I was talking about.

1258
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:52,470
This is what he has is really good.
He's, he's a beast at this. They'll left.

1259
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:55,830
Arm's going to, yes. The
gift. Oh. Nicey Nice. Nice.

1260
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:59,400
How boys should be rolling away from it.
That's a wrap. See these old rap to it.

1261
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:03,330
That's a wrap. Beautiful. Great to
just to, yeah, that's what he has.

1262
01:13:03,331 --> 01:13:04,920
He's got a vicious arm triangle.

1263
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:10,240
There's nothing poor about jail
southern men. He did what he did. He,

1264
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,580
well he's a buddy. He's a
buddy. Everybody. I love that.

1265
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:17,940
He did great things for the UFC,
but then he did bad things for the UFC.

1266
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,370
So it net gated,
it's right down the fucking middle.

1267
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:27,160
Good things for the UFC. But
they did more good than, than,

1268
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:28,023
you know,

1269
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:31,980
a lot of guys are doing the thought of
guys are doing and it's not just him keep

1270
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:36,810
busting these people. Hey, I'm not a
fighter. It's gotta be fucking, you know,

1271
01:13:36,811 --> 01:13:39,810
I gotta ask you something. Yeah. They,
Herschel Walker was on the phone with, uh,

1272
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:43,310
with Goldberg and Gold Berg
asked him what's tougher.

1273
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:48,000
I haven't made training or
football training, you know,
actually I have a matrix.

1274
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:51,780
Oh yeah. By far. And it's
so funny how you know,

1275
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:56,450
and football, you got those. This
August is a motherfucking football.

1276
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:00,690
Y'All five weeks we got as a motherfucker,
even now in the NFL, you can't do two,

1277
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:03,210
two days in a row anymore.
No more. No. The new players,

1278
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,010
they create it because they
said it's too much on the guys.

1279
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:11,270
If you have a two a day, the next day is
either a light day or an off day. Yeah,

1280
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,143
it's weird mark,

1281
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,610
you know, all that toughness training
idea that people had in their head,

1282
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:19,000
they're just overtrained down fuckers
say, yeah, sure. Just overtraining,

1283
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:22,870
motherfuckers breaking joints,
fucking up backs messing up next.

1284
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,570
A lot of the injuries
didn't have to take place.

1285
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,600
It's amazing how even after I read the
book to punch the punches about when uh,

1286
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:32,380
the guy punched Rudy,

1287
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:37,381
Tom John of which and basketball and
1978 after that punch road teams,

1288
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:42,510
you know a lot to play. No more than
two basketball road teams a week. Yeah,

1289
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:47,700
little fish. They realized that
it was too much, too much sauce.

1290
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:52,720
So one thing they stopped after that
punch was no more because they explained

1291
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:57,580
the book. What people don't know was
in those days they flew commercial.

1292
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:58,961
So he got a flight,

1293
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:02,950
the late flight out and the early
flight that they can't have,

1294
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,270
they can't import, you're not getting
sleep. So that's what they stopped.

1295
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:09,700
So it's little things like
that doesn't make adjustments.

1296
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:14,440
But in MMA, you know, going through
a training camp, people asked us,

1297
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:18,430
well what if you know some frequent if
Vernon Davis who's just this freak tied

1298
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:22,600
in for the 40 niners what if he decided
to do MMA? He's such a good athlete, man.

1299
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,351
I'm telling you,

1300
01:15:23,351 --> 01:15:25,990
when you're going through an eight week
camp and you're doing two a days and

1301
01:15:25,991 --> 01:15:29,710
three days for eight weeks,
no one's signing up for that man.

1302
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:33,670
No one like why don't, no, it's
a different type of bird. Yeah.

1303
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:38,671
And the difference between getting hit
and not getting hit or so gigantic.

1304
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:42,370
The difference between being an athlete
where you never get hit by anything.

1305
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:46,300
And then being an athlete where another
man is beating your ass. Not only that,

1306
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:48,070
and you're going to get
your ass beat and training.

1307
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,130
Everyone's getting their ass beat.
Listen, if you're at a high level,

1308
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,920
you're not going playing grab ass.
You know,

1309
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:57,130
in Orange County at the beach
and Newport with some rich dudes,

1310
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,800
you're looking for the baddest guys
in the world and you're saying,

1311
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:02,090
I want you to try and
whip my ass every day.

1312
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:07,590
This man card, bitch, you
ain't going anywhere and going,

1313
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:11,390
what is this show you're doing?
What is your spot that's going to be that?

1314
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:16,880
What time's it start?
Eight. Where is it at?

1315
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:21,340
Eight 55 you're set is fine. Don't worry
about saying, where's your show at?

1316
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:25,060
Fine. Alright, got down at that west side
comedy. You didn't even want to go there.

1317
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:29,530
Don't go there. I have to downtown Jesus
Christ. Nothing at night. Santa Monica,

1318
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:33,400
there's Vampires, Santa Monica.
No danger. Even if you leave now,

1319
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:37,080
you're not gonna make it so forget
it. Stay here. Of course. Well,

1320
01:16:37,081 --> 01:16:40,390
it's not that you got an hour, right?
It was my watch. I got an hour. Oh,

1321
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:43,350
you're straight. You'll take your
10 minutes to get there. Yeah,

1322
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,370
I heard it's a bad crowd, bro. 15 minutes.

1323
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:53,200
I heard it's rough over there to
her angry. See how we're doing.

1324
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:56,680
It's a lot of bad audience
members. Shit. People are drunk.

1325
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,980
Some hacks around right before you,
they're doing all your best bets. Cops,

1326
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:03,190
some guys doing some shit
about always built to dance,

1327
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:10,070
taking a shit. El Gato, he has the
guy seen it seven times, so he knows

1328
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,060
that he knows the routine.
No, not the routine.

1329
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:16,390
Oh, Brian Count is going to have
to abandon some of that material.

1330
01:17:16,391 --> 01:17:18,430
It's going to hurt him badly.
He loves it.

1331
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,210
He loves it. He needs to retire. God Dove,
you'd kill me. Viewers got a few bits,

1332
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,740
got a few bits and been around.
Yeah, they're good though.
Very good. I've seen it.

1333
01:17:27,741 --> 01:17:28,610
45

1334
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:33,841
it's hard.
You know,

1335
01:17:33,841 --> 01:17:37,830
it's really hard if you don't put them
on a a CD or a DVD or something and you

1336
01:17:37,831 --> 01:17:39,810
still have them laying around,
but you never put them on anything,

1337
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,200
that becomes a real problem.
You don't know what to do with them.

1338
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:45,000
Like what am I going to do
with these fucking bets?
Yeah. Look at this transition,

1339
01:17:45,001 --> 01:17:48,480
man, they going to show this again.
I love this fucking transition.

1340
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,570
The way he hit that,
um, that arm triangle,

1341
01:17:51,571 --> 01:17:54,840
all they're going showing the end of
it. Powerful, shitty man. And the truck,

1342
01:17:56,130 --> 01:18:00,960
the a, the transition between
him being in that, uh,

1343
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,050
him trapping that arm and
then hopping across dude.

1344
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:08,790
How good it Frankie Edgar look. Yeah,
he looked good. How bad to Bj look?

1345
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:13,140
He didn't look at that. He's not happy.
Bj. He's not happy with a lot of things,

1346
01:18:13,141 --> 01:18:17,830
apparently was hard. Wait, cut.
Obviously, and Bj doesn't use, um,

1347
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,880
ivs thinks ivs are cheating.
Do you have,

1348
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:25,260
he thinks that cheating
gangster, he's hard. Tough.

1349
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,880
It was too tough to default. You
know what I'm saying? Oh, he's like,

1350
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:30,480
you want me to fight like Bob Sapp
and shit. He's legitimate. Fuck.

1351
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:32,820
He was ready on the best time.
Sylvia, one of the best ever.

1352
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:35,530
I interviewed him way back when he
was a lightweight champ and he would,

1353
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:40,240
he said he would have fought Tim Sylvia.
We fought Leo Machida Franklin. Yeah.

1354
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:45,090
He fought the, but knows the Odo fought
Franklin. Uh, but Bj Fogg the trail.

1355
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,000
That's right. But um, he said, uh, I go,

1356
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:51,690
he was when Tim Sylvia was the champ
and he was like a, yeah. You know,

1357
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:54,990
I'd fight him. Hey, you know, you never
know what happened. He might fall down.

1358
01:18:55,200 --> 01:19:00,000
I get his back. Yo, your
batshit crazy. He's,

1359
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:06,210
you never know what going to happen.
You know. He was serious though.

1360
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:09,510
That's looking at it as Gabriel
Iglesias got a God damn movie.

1361
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:11,430
Kapow only in movie theaters.

1362
01:19:11,431 --> 01:19:15,780
Son Gabriel blow the fuck up
strictly by word of mouth.

1363
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:18,810
No TV show.

1364
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,430
Just rushing and how far you could
get to see him on Chelsea. Yeah.

1365
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,130
And chosen. How come? No
TV shows like that? Yeah.

1366
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,860
He doesn't need it. I'm not showing up
anywhere before 12 he doesn't need it.

1367
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,670
He's like, you're fucking crazy. He
was making before this movie shit,

1368
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:37,350
he was making more on
the road than anybody.

1369
01:19:37,351 --> 01:19:41,880
You would hear about him doing like nine
shows, bro. And a killer murder in it.

1370
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:46,170
If a murder last month he's
been flying into cities

1371
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:48,940
just flying into the city.

1372
01:19:48,941 --> 01:19:51,420
So he took the home like he
usually takes the summer off.

1373
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,150
Not this year for the last month,

1374
01:19:54,151 --> 01:19:58,320
he's just been flying into cities
going into that baddest radio station.

1375
01:19:58,321 --> 01:19:59,154
The same.

1376
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:04,260
You motherfuckers want to do that and
then just setting up a show somewhere that

1377
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,130
night and like crazy.
We got a comedy clubs going to promote

1378
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,800
this smart man. He's a smart
man. He said, fuck mark.

1379
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:15,780
Mr. Wheeler across America went to the
Puerto Rican day parade side of the float.

1380
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:19,290
Wow. Damn. Killing it, Bryan County.
You sticking around. Fuck that shit.

1381
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:22,270
There were no danger there. He told
us, they told you you don't know

1382
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:30,210
what they say. Don't worry about
it. I know I can trust you.

1383
01:20:30,211 --> 01:20:34,140
I feel like I feel I can trust you guys.
I'm going to call Jason Tebow. He'll,

1384
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,010
he'll take you five
minutes on a cover for you.

1385
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:40,290
I told him there was a bunch of broads
done and Mike's excited. I was, I'm like,

1386
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:42,930
you know, he's just
walking around like, yeah,

1387
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:46,380
somebody was talking to some
shit to Mike favorite men.

1388
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:48,960
And my favorite man punched him at the,
uh,

1389
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:50,340
at the comedy store a couple of weeks ago.

1390
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,830
And they were telling me about
the story. They say, yeah,

1391
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,950
somebody was talking some shit to
one of these comedians and said,

1392
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:58,230
go ahead and punch me. So the
guy punched him. I go, oh,

1393
01:20:58,231 --> 01:21:01,710
this is my favorite band that goes
probably Mike Faith, right guy.

1394
01:21:01,711 --> 01:21:04,990
Big Guy with like one of those old
school capsules. Paper Boi tax.

1395
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,660
I mean that's Mike Feldman and then, and
then, yeah, what's Mike Ferry minimum.

1396
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,490
And then I ran into Mike and he's
like, he was laughing. He was like,

1397
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:15,840
you knew it was me. I go, yeah, of
course he fucking ape ape. He's crazy.

1398
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:19,680
He's a funny dude, man. Good Cook. That's
right here, Mike. Favorite cookies,

1399
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,110
barbecue,
his house.

1400
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:25,560
All you gotta do is put on Facebook
having a barbecue man for you within one

1401
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:30,180
hour and go look up. Here's
what we're gonna do. 10 pounds.

1402
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,280
Don't do that. Just makes
you got 15 bitches. So

1403
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,470
I want professional because
I want us to see resumes.

1404
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:42,190
I want to make sure that
had chlamydia or something.

1405
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:48,020
I want to make sure they go home
with disease and he will go you that.

1406
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:53,730
You should go barbecue. I want to
be at, he will go three hours early.

1407
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:58,280
Marinate the meat for you.
The whole fucking deal. He
really knows his shit. Yeah,

1408
01:21:58,281 --> 01:21:59,490
he really is.
Here's an interesting

1409
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:04,300
tick. Edson Barboza only fight in the UFC
ever stopped. Two guys with leg kicks.

1410
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:08,830
He really, Mike Lulo
and um, uh, Hefei aloe,

1411
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,070
aloe vera by the way. That's
on my memory. Okay. Dot.

1412
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:17,100
Kapow but uh, yeah, I can't think
of another guy who stopped to pee.

1413
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:17,920
I might be wrong,

1414
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,650
but I can't think of another
guy who stopped to different
people with leg kicks.

1415
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:24,250
Mitre owned, didn't stop Kimbo with
leg kicks. Now he'd be in his house.

1416
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:29,090
I mean the heart of this Kimbo
went like this, but not too,

1417
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,390
but I'm just trying to think
of slavery to let cakes.

1418
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:35,770
Barbosa was all leg kicks with Lulo,

1419
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:40,220
Mike Lulo and then all leg kicks with
Hafi elbows or works with Mark Henry that

1420
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,050
I was telling you about. He loves them.
Loves them. I was going down there. Yeah,

1421
01:22:44,051 --> 01:22:45,010
that Mark Henry.
Dude,

1422
01:22:45,011 --> 01:22:49,150
I was so impressed by your depiction
of what that guy does for you. Yeah,

1423
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,820
make me want Jaeger made
me want you to move there.

1424
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,450
I don't want to lose your buddy,
but I know go to jersey,

1425
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,720
take care ass to move them up here. They
probably don't want to be there anyway.

1426
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,820
Dell, come on. Brandon and
Jersey should be miserable.

1427
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:07,780
But you'd be smacking people to gym
every day. He would have to. Yeah,

1428
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,640
just people caught up.
Mood Jersey would,

1429
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,680
it's all like you don't know my mentality,

1430
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,530
you know there's a reason why
I'm not fighting in the UFC.

1431
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:17,680
A lot of is my prior convictions.
They wouldn't let me in,

1432
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,660
but if I got in the UFC,
bro,

1433
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:24,280
you don't fucking memos that I
might not have like the best punch.

1434
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:28,450
I might not have the bolt and the most
Jujitsu skills are something, but bro,

1435
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:33,480
my mentality is I don't lose. I go,
fuck. I go fucking mental. I mentalities,

1436
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:34,323
I don't lose.

1437
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,390
My fucking family would kill me if I
lost and I'm going to press forward.

1438
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,490
I'm gonna beat your ass.

1439
01:23:39,491 --> 01:23:41,710
And you're gonna feel that when
you're inside that cage with me.

1440
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:45,370
When that door shuts, when that door
shuts, and you know my mentality,

1441
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:48,970
you'll fucking comes out of me, bro. It
comes out of me. I'm like, I see red.

1442
01:23:48,971 --> 01:23:53,500
I don't even know who I am. By the time
it's over, I'll have fucking memory loss,

1443
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:56,380
but you'll be dead dead.
People have memory loss.

1444
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,140
I won't even remember what happened.
It's like a fucking became a monster.

1445
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:04,960
That's his Jersey and Jersey
thinks he's something special.

1446
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,550
I don't even eat, I don't really
just put me in a fucking cage.

1447
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,130
Drove bottles and then Saturday right.
Became full glass case.

1448
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:19,140
If I fuck cage up eight years ago upon
him and ask him on a Saturday and that

1449
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:24,520
rezone, I went down there. Oh, those guys
didn't want to fucking wrestle with me.

1450
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:27,970
The guys who tell stories
of the past or the worst,

1451
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:31,860
the best of the best or the worst. I beat
Kevin Randleman five times the Yammer,

1452
01:24:31,861 --> 01:24:36,380
which is the amateur. What?
Amateur MMA before he came up.

1453
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:42,420
That's the next UFC hidden camera
show is a fighter to sit with

1454
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:47,290
the little camera right
here with the makeup on.

1455
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,850
Like you just some old guy sitting
in the fucking audience. Yeah,

1456
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,730
just going to the gym. No, you go to
the gym and you work out really badly.

1457
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,470
Don't Bro.
I'm just going to go.

1458
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:59,290
I'll just go on and Gold's gym the
other day I was doing dead lifts in the

1459
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:03,730
middle of my set. This dude comes up to
me. I'm not going to describe big dude.

1460
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:08,530
People figured out a huge dude. Headphones
on. He goes, bro, Bro, I haven't,

1461
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:11,500
I don't know this guy at all.
Seen him maybe twice and then gold.

1462
01:25:11,501 --> 01:25:16,150
I'm only there out of camp,
Bro. Middlesex, Bro. Take my
hair but out. What's up man?

1463
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:20,650
I don't lost you fight. Got To
get better. Got To get better.

1464
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:24,040
You've got to go more aggressive
and your jab and he more jabs. Oh,

1465
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:28,710
not making the middle of a middle. My
set, I need more. You know what I did and,

1466
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,570
and uh,
I'm still sense of balance.

1467
01:25:30,571 --> 01:25:34,600
It's fight less than four weeks ago
I had to collect my thoughts on it.

1468
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:38,950
How many fights do you have
man? He's all, well none.

1469
01:25:38,951 --> 01:25:42,580
I did some wrestling and then I'm
like cool. And I was like, thanks man.

1470
01:25:42,581 --> 01:25:44,890
Just put my headphones on.
I took every ounce,

1471
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:48,880
not the snap his dick off every hour.

1472
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:53,890
How many fights of just scrapping
and go good for you together.

1473
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,881
That's a good question.

1474
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:58,180
The fucking audience during the
fight and the real audience,

1475
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,690
not in the UFC section. Oh, I've done
real well was coming up for sure.

1476
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:04,010
And then you hear them look at

1477
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,060
that fucking and they go, they show up
with that girlfriends all roided out.

1478
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,690
Everyone's a blue bag was the amount of
tap out shirt with the sleeves cut off

1479
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:15,410
and they sit down, hold on
to that girlfriend. And after
every fight they're like,

1480
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:17,020
look at that guy.
He's that guy in the corner.

1481
01:26:17,021 --> 01:26:21,530
I fucked him up at that makes me
fuck that guy up at the tournament,

1482
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,370
you know? You know what else is brutal?
I went to see glory kickboxing. Yeah.

1483
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:29,060
Fantastic fights. Amazing. I
heard so much fun. Really Fun.

1484
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:33,320
But when Joe Schilling is fighting,
you know his, yeah. One of his sayings,

1485
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:37,360
he can't stop crazy. Yeah. So they're
all yelling. Can't stop crazy.

1486
01:26:37,361 --> 01:26:42,361
Like people in the audience can't stop
crazy in the middle of a fucking war with

1487
01:26:42,641 --> 01:26:45,130
one of the best Moy Thai fighters and
the way we want them knocking them out in

1488
01:26:45,131 --> 01:26:48,430
the fourth round was a draw after the
third round and they fought an additional

1489
01:26:48,431 --> 01:26:53,260
route and Schilling caught him with a
wicked right hook on the jaw in the,

1490
01:26:53,261 --> 01:26:57,370
in a squire old scramble. Boom. Flatlines
and for the first time, it's career.

1491
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:01,930
First time the dude loss. Anyway, the
whole time can't stop crazy girls.

1492
01:27:01,931 --> 01:27:05,770
Guys, fucking everybody thought
like yelling out, can't stop crazy.

1493
01:27:05,771 --> 01:27:08,560
He's going to like, you know
what? You're right. You can't.

1494
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:13,430
Oh fuck. It's crazy though,

1495
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:17,230
is when you hear,
knock them out,

1496
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:22,620
knock them out. And you're neglecting
the body. I just want to be like timeout,

1497
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:26,200
bitch. I'm trying. I am trying.
What do you think I'm trying to do?

1498
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:28,380
What do you hear when you're in there?
How has Barbara was nothing.

1499
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,580
I don't hear any of it.
It's all just can hear my coach.

1500
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:34,600
I listened to the other corner a lot
of the time but I can hear the corners

1501
01:27:34,601 --> 01:27:37,100
talking but you don't hear
the audience just to zone did.

1502
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:40,000
You can hear boos and chairs for sure.
Dog.

1503
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:44,350
Let me tell you about it when I said he
is, insurers didn't even let Ariana go

1504
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:51,670
is not the only book. Buffalo like buffet.
You get that TV show now man, she's,

1505
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,280
she's doing overall on right
dude. Dude, haven't done,

1506
01:27:54,281 --> 01:27:55,610
just cracked him with a right hook hook.

1507
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:59,510
He landed a right hook and then exchange
what kind of TV show she's in. Overhaul.

1508
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:03,920
Overhaul. What's Oval Hole? Overhauling
is a, my friend, my friend bud show.

1509
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:07,460
Oh snap. There was a show where they
take cars, they stealing from people.

1510
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:09,150
They fix him up and then they,
yeah,

1511
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:12,930
she's had dumped just what is Donald's
background? I don't know ways of Jujitsu,

1512
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,410
black belt,
ballet guy.

1513
01:28:15,411 --> 01:28:19,760
I don't think my probably dancing.

1514
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,740
We danced against each other
in the nutcracker. Yeah,

1515
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:26,390
he's got good fucking striking.
You hit Landon another right hook.

1516
01:28:26,391 --> 01:28:30,110
I'm the exchange after that kick dude.
Evan Dunham is no joke on the feet.

1517
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:32,240
That's why I was surprised as
them saying that they have,

1518
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:33,230
he has to take him down.

1519
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:37,560
He's moving real good and he's training
a lot with Raci foe. Ray Is, uh,

1520
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:41,540
done a lot of work with him.
Kickboxing. Oh, Don Landon and nice.

1521
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:46,210
Right left hand there. That's why
I said that. It has been in the

1522
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:52,280
tattoo chair. Get tatted
up. Yeah. He's got his, uh,

1523
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:55,370
his back inside or done up
through the ribs or, yeah.

1524
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:57,530
That's the most painful spot.
Po apparently

1525
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:03,570
tagged them working on that single one.
One thing that Donna is,

1526
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:05,940
he's fucking relentless.
Relentless.

1527
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,920
Yeah.

1528
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,470
He's been jogged a couple of
times to the Sean sherk fight.

1529
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:13,620
I thought he won that fight. The good
fight. That was a real good fight.

1530
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:18,120
So short and is done. Yeah. Um, yeah.

1531
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:22,100
Sean's just had too many injuries. A
little, little too much. Tom Gas line.

1532
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:27,180
What about the shy from Aka Fitch?
No, the other guy. Which one?

1533
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:32,280
Koscheck. Yeah, Josh. He
moved right here. Ooh, Nice.

1534
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:34,010
Needed thereby by balls on it.

1535
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:38,190
You know Josh has been in the game for
a long time right now. I don't know.

1536
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,650
I don't see him on be cards coming up.
Yeah,

1537
01:29:40,651 --> 01:29:43,650
well he lost a Robbie Lawler first
round knock out. This is the last fight.

1538
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:45,510
I don't know if he's
got anything scheduled.

1539
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:49,720
Donald was not like this crazy hot
streak and then they gave him a Melvin

1540
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:53,010
Julliard. He knocked all that me
Gallard was on fire and that fight,

1541
01:29:53,011 --> 01:29:57,030
that was Prime Melvin Melvin's on point.
Super terrifying.

1542
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,850
Melvin Gallard on point.
He's like one of the best.

1543
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:03,420
It's one of the times coming
right in, man, look at this.

1544
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:06,750
But Donald Cerrone Kinda
of his heart and he did.

1545
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:10,920
That was a crazy fight in Denver. That's
right near an easy fight back and forth.

1546
01:30:10,921 --> 01:30:13,740
She didn't kick and then the right hand
behind it wobbled him with the Shin kick

1547
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:17,790
and then boom, he shamed him in
the head off the left switch.

1548
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:23,380
This is an interesting fight,
man,

1549
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:28,420
but I gave done him way more credit than
whoever was doing the commentary with

1550
01:30:28,421 --> 01:30:31,810
the, with the stand up. He's pretty
slick. Yeah. You called it before.

1551
01:30:31,811 --> 01:30:35,540
He said one thing people
are talking about is, oh no,

1552
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:37,030
load on the ball.

1553
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:41,340
The ball's in the body and the
body and the body was it? Yeah.

1554
01:30:41,341 --> 01:30:44,780
It was hard to tell, but it looked
like he was it. It was his balls.

1555
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:45,730
That was crazy.

1556
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:48,960
Was he indicating that it was his balls
or was he indicating that he had hidden

1557
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:51,430
and he got in the boat? They'll show
it again. They'll show it again.

1558
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:53,260
I hope it was the bottom.

1559
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:55,980
Do you want my Cheetos telling me if you
get kicked in the body like that where

1560
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:57,580
you got to do fall into your back.

1561
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,800
I'm getting your guard so
you recovery can grab them.

1562
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:03,580
Most guys aren't just going to jump in
so it buys you time. Since he was a kid.

1563
01:31:03,581 --> 01:31:08,120
That's what he's learning to do more kick
related Kaos te calles mostly history.

1564
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:11,980
How do you can't do my skin. It's
that interesting. Interesting.

1565
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:15,680
I want to see the rings crew Pie.
Yeah, me too. Let's see this.

1566
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:21,820
This is by the way, he was indicating,
oh no. Right in the solar plexus.

1567
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:26,290
The solar plate, but it didn't look that
clean. Who it did? It's like a foot.

1568
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:30,550
Look at this. Let's see it again. Yeah.
Grazed up right here. Right up top.

1569
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:35,530
And the solar plate. We're grazing
with the toes, but gentlemen, I love,

1570
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:40,090
I got to go. Oh, you savage.
You guys go to town. Go to
the funny, look at this man.

1571
01:31:40,091 --> 01:31:44,830
We all got in there, Huh? Yeah. It's
toes just dug into his solar plexus,

1572
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,293
man.

1573
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:53,410
I never thought about when he hit to
the body to just go to your button.

1574
01:31:53,411 --> 01:31:56,410
Recovering. Having him try and get in
your guard. At least bide your time. Yeah,

1575
01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:00,180
and he was telling me he kicked your
legs. Exactly. Which is cool. Yeah.

1576
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,390
You're not going to fist fight.
Yeah.

1577
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:05,530
You know who did that Veit tour
when he fought 'em fight John Jones.

1578
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:09,920
That's right. So I kicked him in the
body. Yup. He went right to this.

1579
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:13,750
One of the rare times you saw a front
leg side kick being utilized like that.

1580
01:32:13,751 --> 01:32:18,640
Like to the body. Yup. John
Jones. Man. Scary dude.

1581
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,490
There's Mark Henry right
there. There he is. The man,

1582
01:32:21,491 --> 01:32:25,420
the myth when he gets trained
with them again, I don't know man.

1583
01:32:25,421 --> 01:32:27,640
It take some time. Go down there.
It's good time to be in New Jersey.

1584
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:30,940
Look at powerful.
Gabriel Iglesias is blown the fuck up.

1585
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:37,240
Who's the hottest comics right now? Him
and Kevin Hart. Yeah. Touch point. Oh No,

1586
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:42,490
and he's a really good comment but
poshest because those guys are on another

1587
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:46,180
level. Him and Kevin Hart's at the biggest
right now. Kevin Hart's number one,

1588
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,180
killing it. Camp Williams is on
his way back. I'll tell you that.

1589
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:54,040
I saw his new shit. He's so funny. Dot.
Williams knew shit is hilarious dude.

1590
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:57,880
He had a new thing that somebody filmed
like on and put it up on Youtube.

1591
01:32:57,881 --> 01:33:01,110
I don't know if it's up anymore because
I think it was like his new special that

1592
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:05,740
somebody filmed in the audience. It was
like a an audience. Youtube camera dude.

1593
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,910
Kids on fire. He's back 100% and
I didn't like his last special.

1594
01:33:09,911 --> 01:33:12,190
I didn't think his last
special was like as focused.

1595
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:15,460
I didn't think it was as
good as his previous shit the
rest of every fucking day.

1596
01:33:15,461 --> 01:33:18,910
How can you be focused? Dude?
It's funny. His own shit is funny.

1597
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:22,290
Why was he getting arrested so much?
Getting crazy talking about drug.

1598
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:25,360
Unless I'm drunk. I don't
know. He's getting crazy. Well,

1599
01:33:25,361 --> 01:33:27,880
you don't do that if you just eat
McDonald's. You know what, dude?

1600
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:30,970
I don't think you could get a fucking
real comedian that's not at least

1601
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:32,140
partially crazy.

1602
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:36,400
Whenever I hear a funny guy
who's doing some crazy shit,

1603
01:33:36,401 --> 01:33:39,790
you hear about him doing something demons,
so if you're funny,

1604
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:42,160
you had some demons.
I don't know if it's demons,

1605
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:45,100
but impulsive comedians are nuts.

1606
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:50,020
The ability to go up there and get into
a cage and Duke it out with some dude

1607
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:52,840
did the average person,
they're not going to understand you.

1608
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:56,800
So when you start telling crazy stories
then away they're not going to know who

1609
01:33:56,801 --> 01:34:00,310
is this fucking guy. The guy like me, I
embraced that and I said, it's so warm.

1610
01:34:00,311 --> 01:34:04,810
I'm like, yes. Like my friend
Tate, same way like Tate Tate,

1611
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:08,140
Tate will tell you some crazy fucking
stories and he just want to give him a hug

1612
01:34:08,141 --> 01:34:09,600
and giggle with them for sure.
You know,

1613
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:13,360
cause he's a savage and he
loves fellow savages. You know,

1614
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,320
you run into a dude that is living
a life like yours. You know,

1615
01:34:17,321 --> 01:34:20,500
if you were some cat that's like a,
you know,

1616
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:24,040
a doctor or a lawyer or tried to
keep it on the up and up all day,

1617
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:25,630
they're not going to know
what the fuck to do with you.

1618
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:29,160
Well a lot of comics at the
same way you do with that story,

1619
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:33,850
a lot of comics are the same way because
a lot of comics are just maniacs.

1620
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:37,420
I mean,
I keep it together as much as possible,

1621
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:40,900
but I know a lot of comedians are just
maniacs and you hear about them doing

1622
01:34:40,901 --> 01:34:43,520
something crazy and you're
like, yeah, I saw that comment.

1623
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:46,270
So when you hear about a guy like
Katt Williams is funny as fuck,

1624
01:34:46,271 --> 01:34:49,660
just getting arrested all over the place
and do a nutty shit and screaming and

1625
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:53,350
audience. He like, yeah, he's
got a fucking hit it kind
of an engine in there, man.

1626
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:57,560
Sometimes that fucker over heats sometimes
blows a rod. I think toughest thing,

1627
01:34:57,561 --> 01:35:00,620
maybe the same with comics is you guys
are on the road and you gotta be on,

1628
01:35:00,621 --> 01:35:04,670
there's so much stimulus all the time is
when I get home, I just, I have anxiety.

1629
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:07,970
I can't like sit down and relax.
I Ha I have to make myself busy.

1630
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,390
I have to have stuff going on really well.
I have a family,

1631
01:35:11,391 --> 01:35:12,830
so it's very different.
So when I get home,

1632
01:35:12,831 --> 01:35:15,950
I chill out and just hanging out with the
little ones and just have a good time.

1633
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:19,990
I like to get in the pool and
really learn how to do that. Yeah,

1634
01:35:19,991 --> 01:35:23,000
I bet over the last few years of my life,
I've learned how to really,

1635
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:27,080
really relaxed and just shut my phone off.
Don't answer any emails,

1636
01:35:27,081 --> 01:35:31,070
don't look at my, uh, you know, I don't
do anything. I don't read the news.

1637
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:34,210
I don't do shit for hours at a time.
And if I don't do anything,

1638
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,620
I feel like I'm slacking and being lazy.
Well,

1639
01:35:36,621 --> 01:35:38,900
there's certain times that I
definitely feel like that too.

1640
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:40,850
There's definitely times
that I feel like that too,

1641
01:35:40,851 --> 01:35:44,600
but as long as I've covered all my basis,
as long as I get all my shit done,

1642
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:49,120
but I can't enjoy a vacation. If I don't
get all my shit done, I found that, yep.

1643
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:51,860
Then I'm, if I can't, if I haven't
gotten my shit down, it's just,

1644
01:35:51,861 --> 01:35:55,430
it eats at me again. Anxiety. Like
I went to King coon after that, uh,

1645
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,420
Arlovski fight.

1646
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:59,480
Literally all I could think about as
there lots of fight and how I'm going to

1647
01:35:59,481 --> 01:36:01,670
change. Strang yeah.
All I did your course,

1648
01:36:01,671 --> 01:36:04,520
you could have put me in
Nebraska and it had been exactly,

1649
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:09,380
it wouldn't matter where I was. Beach was
great. I mean now that manner, the food,

1650
01:36:09,381 --> 01:36:12,460
I could care less about you just sticking
them out. The most important thing.

1651
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:16,790
Yeah. It's no way around that man. If
you want to get great at something,

1652
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:18,080
you have to have madness.

1653
01:36:18,081 --> 01:36:22,230
And the only way you're ever
really going to appreciate the, uh,

1654
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:24,770
like a significant growth
moment in your life,

1655
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,370
like a big loss where you just really
felt like shit. You got to feel that pain.

1656
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:30,660
You got to feel that pain.
So it motivates the change.

1657
01:36:30,661 --> 01:36:34,040
She would feel that pain so that you,
you up your training crazy man.

1658
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:35,550
He told him I have to,

1659
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:39,410
are not a in nothing
and an Evan Dunham's uh,

1660
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,810
defense or nothing's worse than
in hit there, man. It's true.

1661
01:36:41,811 --> 01:36:46,490
But Donald has talked to shit beast.
It's just so unusual. I agree.

1662
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:49,010
I've seen him get lit up like that.
Wow.

1663
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:53,570
It's crazy because that easily could
have been in any other fight. I mean,

1664
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:55,780
I no doubt about it. It hurt
like fucking hell. I mean,

1665
01:36:55,781 --> 01:36:58,910
I haven't done them as tough as shit.
If he went down, he's, he's the reason.

1666
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:01,390
There's a reason.
But in any other fight that,

1667
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:05,720
but just been an exchange with nothing
happened in the fight. Kept going weird.

1668
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:10,790
My bowser can crack though. That's what,
that's all about. Those as a beast. Yeah.

1669
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:15,791
He kicks fucking hard on the 11 o'clock
in New Jersey and it's Wednesday night

1670
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,230
leaving Wednesday night and
these savages is still out.

1671
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:25,680
Most of them stuff to do it too. Oh Shit.
Rondo's girl who fight Ronda Jessamine.

1672
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:30,140
Duda Solomon Duke. When the four
one more spin. More swimming.

1673
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:34,130
I don't know what you call it. What is
that about when of course women. Well,

1674
01:37:34,131 --> 01:37:38,060
it's uh, just the men. The
other girl fights in the UFC.

1675
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:41,150
Marina and Rhonda.
Who this chicken was good.

1676
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:45,860
The chicken was part of the squad.
She's on the Rhonda Program. Yeah,

1677
01:37:45,861 --> 01:37:49,580
but there's another one. Her opponent. The
other one's a beast. Yeah. Rubies moves.

1678
01:37:49,581 --> 01:37:50,414
Good.
Yup.

1679
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:56,080
I think she took down an eight days notice
to Frankie Edgar. He'd fight your Rye.

1680
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:00,660
A favorite one 40. Ooh. I'd love to see
that fight. If the right situation arises.

1681
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:05,160
He says, Holy Shit, be a great fight. Why
don't they just fight at one 45 I agree.

1682
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:08,730
You're right.
Fought at one 45 before he could do it.

1683
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,890
I agree for Frankie.

1684
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:15,450
That's gotta be a hard ass cut another
five more pounds that they can do it.

1685
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:20,720
Look a Mel Gibson hate Jews still
make a fucking movies that bad ass

1686
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:21,990
motherfucker.

1687
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:26,350
I guess this is the Stallone production.
You can do whatever the fuck he want.

1688
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:29,980
They filming a boat Garrick cause you
don't have to pay the same eye as taxes

1689
01:38:29,981 --> 01:38:33,950
and you don't have to get like permits
to blow shit up so he doesn't bulk

1690
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,920
Garrett cause cool dog blow up
whatever you want. Stay alone.

1691
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:40,030
God alone.

1692
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:43,300
There's never been a dude closer to 70
that's still kicking ass in a convincing

1693
01:38:43,301 --> 01:38:44,230
manner.
I agree.

1694
01:38:44,231 --> 01:38:48,450
He just jumped off a building
onto a helicopter and a
movie and he's 70 straight

1695
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:49,570
up,
straight up,

1696
01:38:49,571 --> 01:38:54,571
jumped off of a fucking building
onto a helicopter 70 like this

1697
01:38:56,150 --> 01:38:58,030
with only one lip that moves

1698
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:06,130
kinda chicken heads. He's dealing with
this alone. 50 year old chicken hats.

1699
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:08,230
You've got to up your chicken head.

1700
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:12,580
The number to age where you're
tolerated wasn't so I don't think,

1701
01:39:12,581 --> 01:39:16,270
I think you've spoken with 2124 year olds.
You don't take pictures of women.

1702
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:17,860
Did you know that Smith is his wife?

1703
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:23,040
I remember somebody was telling us he
probably doesn't want to take no women

1704
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:26,440
cause you don't want to deal
with the drama man and a woman.

1705
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:30,430
But no women's Arnold's
the same exact way.

1706
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:35,080
Arms the same way too late on those. Me
and him took a picture and he goes, oh,

1707
01:39:35,081 --> 01:39:37,270
and he had his assistant getting,
I was like, oh this bitch.

1708
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:42,320
They get this assistant in there
every time. Yeah. Every time. Die Eye.

1709
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:46,540
It has to be for some reason because you
know chicken heads are going to keep it

1710
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:49,060
and then post say, no, look at this. We
were here, then he raped me or whatever.

1711
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:53,950
Bullshit. It certainly probably
can't happen. Boom. Bam,

1712
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:58,620
Bop, Bop. So in the next
fight is Jessamyn. Yeah.

1713
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:02,870
Jessamine Duke. I think that fight
already happens on it did. Yeah.

1714
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:07,800
It already took place. So, so
Miller is the next fight. No,

1715
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:11,650
they're going to put it
in Mac at the time. Yeah.

1716
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:15,700
You're going to put it into a at time,
probably the earliest and shit. Oh No,

1717
01:40:15,701 --> 01:40:18,310
it did happen earlier. That's what I'm
saying. Yeah. But it probably ended early.

1718
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:22,750
So be a fast fight them. Sorry.
Um, maybe, maybe not, you know,

1719
01:40:22,751 --> 01:40:24,040
first round stoppage.

1720
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:29,041
And right now it's only
eight 1535 minutes.

1721
01:40:29,771 --> 01:40:34,240
I told you have 45 minutes is
probably a first round fight. Yeah.

1722
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:38,820
Dan and I'll put the other one. There
you go. Nine o'clock. It's over.

1723
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:40,110
Powerful women's Bantam weight.

1724
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:44,260
Wipeout they know white still not making
a fuck of the parents in Atlantic city.

1725
01:40:44,261 --> 01:40:48,640
I told you he's up in his room,
but 18 fucking body God

1726
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:54,050
called Kimbo slice back at
just a god out there that

1727
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:59,350
Duke has got some long reach son. Oh
Shit. Good right hand by the other girl.

1728
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:02,873
Okay.

1729
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:07,990
Uh, adjustment only has I think, I think
your records. Three and one real quick.

1730
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:09,740
Yeah. She lost her last fight. Yeah,

1731
01:41:09,741 --> 01:41:11,650
she's three in one I think
might be foreign one.

1732
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:16,260
What did she fight my last fight?
Uh, she fought home girl who, uh,

1733
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:19,330
threw up the for, what's her
name? Uh, has that weird name?

1734
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:24,340
Brazilin Amanda Nunez?
No, I forget her name,

1735
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:29,020
but a batch. Oh,
Pechakucha hair. Yup. Yeah.

1736
01:41:30,010 --> 01:41:33,580
Yeah. They were shocked that she lost that
fight, but I didn't think too, I agree.

1737
01:41:33,581 --> 01:41:37,330
I didn't think, I didn't think
it was shocking. Like they
were like, what the hell?

1738
01:41:37,331 --> 01:41:40,270
Like her whole corner was like, what?
Oh, I know. And I was like, come on.

1739
01:41:40,271 --> 01:41:44,770
Did you watch the fight? She didn't
do much. Just talented though.

1740
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:49,210
Just got a good striking. I like
her length to, for chair super long.

1741
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:51,700
She just has a user reach,
good front kick to the body.

1742
01:41:57,710 --> 01:42:00,140
It's got to be really hard
being a lot of these girls,

1743
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,900
knowing that Rhonda is at
the top of the food chain.

1744
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:04,173
Yeah.

1745
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:08,070
It's just the level of athleticism
you're dealing with when you take it.

1746
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:12,040
She's getting blasted.
She is just standing straight up.

1747
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:15,040
One of these checks probably got
a picture around the whole wall.

1748
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:19,000
She's drinking Roy eggs.
It's gotta be just like fucking rocky,

1749
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:24,810
top down, just five rounds.
The doctor don't do remax.

1750
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:26,990
Doe saw the most fucking paper view

1751
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:32,020
mega come back by then.
Epo Free,

1752
01:42:33,410 --> 01:42:37,230
fucking free.
They'll give him somebody.

1753
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,690
Hey, what are they going to
do? Speak of this. Okay, we're,

1754
01:42:40,691 --> 01:42:43,960
Brian was talking about this Guy Aubrey
de grey that he interviewed recently who

1755
01:42:43,961 --> 01:42:46,240
was a anti aging specialist.

1756
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:49,750
If they do figure out
a way to reverse aging,

1757
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:54,550
what the fuck would they do if all of a
sudden Randy coture looked like he was

1758
01:42:54,551 --> 01:42:58,180
30 years old again and he's
inside the octagon dope.

1759
01:42:58,390 --> 01:43:03,160
How weird would that, how we're all shit.

1760
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:04,150
All my goodness.

1761
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:10,150
The phone Cox fights over the time.
Rhonda on the bat phone.

1762
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:15,170
I told you she looked good. Yeah, she
did look good. Did chicky dangerous son.

1763
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:19,720
That shit ain't no.
Yeah, she can strike man.

1764
01:43:19,721 --> 01:43:23,930
She can still watch out. You
beat it any faster. You gonna
piss round off. Yeah, no.

1765
01:43:23,931 --> 01:43:27,400
Same. Then you got to find
it in your head, son. Well,

1766
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:30,280
all you have to do is have a few of
those and you're going to have a fight on

1767
01:43:30,281 --> 01:43:34,860
your hand anyway. Oh, one more. And
the women's division. Number two,

1768
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:38,590
you're if records three and oh, you're
in. You won. You won your fight.

1769
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:42,680
You are now the number one contender won
my first UFC fight. Boom, boom. Yeah.

1770
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:43,720
Very nice guy.

1771
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:49,620
Look how she keeps her chin talk
this whole time. Her Chin is tough.

1772
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:51,620
Oh Man.
Oh Shit.

1773
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:55,500
Fuck. All right here. Look at that.
Left to the body. The right ball,

1774
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:57,440
either shoulder and she
even adjusted the knee.

1775
01:43:57,441 --> 01:43:59,740
When she saw she was going down and
went to the shoulder. She's like,

1776
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:03,650
she's not eating for a week now at
the Rhonda household. Lost you lost.

1777
01:44:03,651 --> 01:44:08,180
We don't sell all that damn bitch.
She ain't fucking around.

1778
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:11,150
I got Puerto Rican chick from Amherst,

1779
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:18,680
Massachusetts walking around Puerto Rican
chick from Larry Kelly's neighborhood.

1780
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:22,430
Dave fucking around. Look,
El Nino shirt on. She's wow.

1781
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:27,090
I'm telling you. Buff is the only one
they sent on this mission. She showed up.

1782
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:32,650
I flew on the plane with
buffer from the stories.

1783
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:37,580
That didn't happen. I have to
earbud with him. Otherwise,

1784
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:41,990
we talked the entire 50 minutes nonstop
about girls. Oh no, he didn't go. Yeah,

1785
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:45,830
don't tell me anymore. Don't tell me
anymore because I'll start crying.

1786
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:51,350
Pavel, John, adequate
suite, purple tie on.

1787
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:56,390
I hate how guys wear three piece
suits as Lee Smith throwing down.

1788
01:44:56,391 --> 01:45:01,380
Very impressed. Seven five. She's
tough, man. Super tough. Yeah. Yeah.

1789
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:04,160
I don't like the three piece suit either.
They gave me a jacket.

1790
01:45:04,161 --> 01:45:06,740
I stopped wearing the jacket. I wore the
jacket for a little while, but I'm like,

1791
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:11,330
what am I wearing this jacket to do?
I'm built like a bridge troll.

1792
01:45:11,331 --> 01:45:13,370
They don't really make track.
Well they do.

1793
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:17,780
You look like you look like odd job from
James Bond. You don't want that. Yeah.

1794
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:22,310
It looks very boxy. Cars to a man
with narrow shoulders like a Jon Anik.

1795
01:45:22,311 --> 01:45:24,800
More of a feminine gentlemen.
Beautiful Man.

1796
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:28,310
Beautiful MEMFix skinny flooring to pull
off a suffix. He can pull off a suit.

1797
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:31,790
I looked like an ape. I look like
someone trying to dress up a monkey.

1798
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:36,080
I love me some soup. I just can't have
that extra clothing. I just got too much.

1799
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:40,080
Not you either. He's on West
going, I feel like a loser. Loser.

1800
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:42,650
Loser. I do. I'm not kidding.

1801
01:45:42,651 --> 01:45:47,210
I feel like some guys feel uncomfortable
suck in the man's Dick Sucking Dick for

1802
01:45:47,211 --> 01:45:50,070
the man.
When my fucking suit on hedging the three,

1803
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:52,530
they could've started off in
something a little more subtle.

1804
01:45:52,531 --> 01:45:53,810
I can put you in a three piece.

1805
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:59,780
I showed you a traditional,
I'm very traditional with my ties.

1806
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:04,010
It's just pathetic. It's a
silly outfit. And not only that,

1807
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:06,320
it's an Alpha that leaves
you vulnerable to attack.

1808
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:10,100
I don't like having a fucking
handle around my neck. I'm sorry.

1809
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:14,240
I've been kava choked and Kanga times
super uncomfortable in a Zeke yield.

1810
01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:16,670
Many a day.
I've been a,

1811
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:20,210
I've been caught with
that fucking clock choke.

1812
01:46:20,211 --> 01:46:23,330
The guys get to come around and they
go like that and then go on to the arm.

1813
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:27,050
That's nasty. That's a nasty chuck.
And that's all about your collar.

1814
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:30,950
Why would you have a tie on if you've
got a tie on and it's a strong tie,

1815
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:33,950
you're a dead man. You're
screwed. You're a dead man.

1816
01:46:33,951 --> 01:46:36,710
They weren't thinking about that because
everyone's, but he's worried about,

1817
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:41,240
oh shit. Oh, it's coming next. If
you, if a guy has a tie on, okay.

1818
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:44,600
And you slip your hand around that
not so it's not going to change.

1819
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:48,120
So it's not going to slip in around
either controlling that knot and then you

1820
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:49,980
start cranking. Yeah. And you get it.

1821
01:46:49,981 --> 01:46:53,110
Like you get side control
on this motherfucker and
you start cranking on that

1822
01:46:53,111 --> 01:46:56,940
night. He's a dead man. Yeah. That's
if you decide he's dead, he's dead.

1823
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:59,450
You left a handle on if you do,
if,

1824
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:03,300
if Billy from the nine to five
office does it there straight. Yeah.

1825
01:47:03,301 --> 01:47:06,030
Well that's true. But I'm saying
someone who's choke guys before,

1826
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:08,850
someone who had any strong
person who understands the move,

1827
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:11,610
it's not a complicated move
as he keeled chokes, you know,

1828
01:47:11,611 --> 01:47:15,210
anything like we collared,
Choking Column Two,

1829
01:47:15,211 --> 01:47:18,300
fingers snapping act.
But do you teach somebody,

1830
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:20,310
you know this one where you
reach back with the hand,

1831
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:22,920
like the karate chop and you grabbed the
back of the neck and then you do this

1832
01:47:22,921 --> 01:47:24,460
one right here through it.
God,

1833
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,020
so much power in that you teach someone
that first day they kill somebody's

1834
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:30,680
first day,
first day they got a submission.

1835
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:35,470
Ah,

1836
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:40,770
there's Brennan looking sexy as
fuck. No. Three piece suit. Note it.

1837
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:45,020
Ladies and gentlemen, sir. Well,
I was UFC now. Yeah. No, I'll,

1838
01:47:45,021 --> 01:47:49,710
I'll rock a nice jacket. But three
piece. No. Yeah, UFC fight pass.

1839
01:47:49,711 --> 01:47:52,710
I'm a member bypass who's not a member.

1840
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,490
I love the fact they're putting all this,
they're being proactive.

1841
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:58,710
Put all these fights on
the Internet in the future.

1842
01:47:58,711 --> 01:48:00,390
That's going to be where
it's at, man. For sure.

1843
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:03,750
You're going to have a fight pass app
that's going to be on your television or

1844
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:07,770
just whatever and you're gonna be able
to watch TV, right? Apple TV, Netflix,

1845
01:48:07,771 --> 01:48:12,510
all that stuff. Yup. Yup. Powerful.
Brian. Stan. Little too handsome.

1846
01:48:12,511 --> 01:48:15,510
Little to big 10 next to Brian.
They look a little weird.

1847
01:48:15,511 --> 01:48:20,100
It looks like you want them in a,
yeah, like some sort of contest. Jon.

1848
01:48:20,101 --> 01:48:24,690
Anik has different hands. Donaldson.
Roni, Jim Miller, six and seven.

1849
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:29,040
Oh Shit. Yeah. That's a beast of a
what? A division. What a division.

1850
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:33,990
I hope Josh Thompson gets some good
fights in, you know, he's like 35 36 now.

1851
01:48:33,991 --> 01:48:36,180
Right?
The last one he's thinking about retiring.

1852
01:48:36,210 --> 01:48:38,490
I think it was just don't give
them that number four though.

1853
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:41,880
Don't we give Thompson
number four beep hapy what?

1854
01:48:41,881 --> 01:48:43,930
Joe Don't give anybody
that guy. No, he, he,

1855
01:48:43,931 --> 01:48:46,340
he's also another guy where with
like who wants to find a beaver ones?

1856
01:48:46,341 --> 01:48:50,440
Like maybe next week. Oh, I got
something coming up. No you don't. Oh,

1857
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:54,810
wants to throw down with the crazy qtip
what, when it comes out with that, uh,

1858
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:59,220
the Russia crazy hat on. Yeah.
Shit. It's getting warm. Good Gary.

1859
01:48:59,221 --> 01:49:02,250
Good wrestling is no joke.
And he's aggressive as fuck.

1860
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:06,510
Plus he comes from a place where death
is just a normal part of life. You know,

1861
01:49:06,511 --> 01:49:08,900
it's a very dangerous part
of Russia. Well they, they,

1862
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:12,780
they showed him fricking choking
out of crazy beers and shit.

1863
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:18,060
Four years old while I was playing
grab ass. Here we go, man. God Damn.

1864
01:49:18,061 --> 01:49:20,400
This is going to be a fun
fight. Yes. He was super fun.

1865
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:25,200
I hope it goes a little while so
we can see the, see the game plans.

1866
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:28,183
Hmm.

1867
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:36,390
Donald has that tricky Jujitsu.
Yeah.

1868
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:40,160
And then Jim Miller just has that
straight traditional bad ass black belt

1869
01:49:40,161 --> 01:49:44,870
Jujitsu. He fucking submitted
call Moise now that's big man.

1870
01:49:44,871 --> 01:49:48,090
Huge.
That's an arm bar from the guards.

1871
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:52,660
The guards son come on as a boiler.
Gracie black belt, old school Jujitsu,

1872
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:56,410
black belt, who's been around a while
for breach hill known for his Jujitsu.

1873
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:00,550
So for him to be on top and for
the way he did it too is so slick.

1874
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:04,840
Slip that Shin across the face
and then slap that bitch on.

1875
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:10,060
Jim Miller's got a serious fucking guard.
Real technical guard.

1876
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:11,920
I mean if,
if these two grappled,

1877
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:14,710
if it was just a straight like metamorris
or something like that and worlds,

1878
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:19,930
Jim Miller would, I think kinda
own Serone on the ground. I do.

1879
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:20,800
I think you'd put a,

1880
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,950
just cause he's positioning does a lot
more Jujitsu and a g no first Jujitsu.

1881
01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:26,860
Wow. However, in the UFC,

1882
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:30,730
Donald has these couple of moves where
you just can't duplicate in practice and

1883
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:33,280
by the time you,
you realize your comments too late,

1884
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,480
how do you think his fight goes down?
Oh Man.

1885
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,780
Uh, does it depend on which Donald Serone
shows up? Yeah, I mean, I mean, look,

1886
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:48,280
we all know how talented Donald is
and sometimes more times than not,

1887
01:50:48,281 --> 01:50:52,120
he's shown up and you're in
trouble. Um, I, I think, uh,

1888
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:54,610
Donald has a lot more
ways to finish this fight,

1889
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:57,800
but I think it's the toughest fight
Donald's had in a long time. Wow.

1890
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,290
I would agree with you with that.

1891
01:50:59,291 --> 01:51:03,010
I think it's a real close fight and
I think that Donald, when he's on,

1892
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:04,750
and he's been on a lot lately,

1893
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:08,200
he seems to me like a dude who's turned
the corner. I could realizes that,

1894
01:51:08,201 --> 01:51:09,370
you know what,
he might've had some,

1895
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:13,150
some lapses in his career where
he didn't fight at his best.

1896
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:16,540
Donald's also a guy who,
he's a wild,

1897
01:51:16,541 --> 01:51:19,000
when I talk about not bailing arrest
and not be able to turn it off,

1898
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:22,660
you're talking about Donald who's
wrestling fricking Jaguars and shit and

1899
01:51:22,661 --> 01:51:26,650
jumping off mountains and driving
Harley Davidson's into walls and shit.

1900
01:51:26,651 --> 01:51:30,880
Like he's a whole nother level and now he,
Donald's not single anymore.

1901
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:34,690
He has a fiance who's kind of calm them
down. So nice focus. More on fighting.

1902
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:39,150
I think he's won every fight since, I
mean the dos Anjos fight. He lost he,

1903
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:42,430
what does he, what is he coming
out too? What songs? Cowboy. No.

1904
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,320
Yeah,

1905
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:45,310
always CCR.

1906
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:47,790
Okay.

1907
01:51:47,790 --> 01:51:49,980
She was a long cool woman
and a black dress. Yup.

1908
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:56,530
Always CCR. They look at him. He looks
like he's ready to have some fun.

1909
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:00,580
Yeah. How crazy it. He's
born in Sparta, New Jersey.

1910
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,530
We Sparta high school. Sparta
high. That's hilarious though.

1911
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:10,270
I mean you want to talk about a perfect
place for a fighter to be born. Sparta.

1912
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:14,980
Both of you guys from New Jersey.
Yeah. Boring. Well, he's from Aruba.

1913
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:16,263
You're from Cuba.

1914
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,553
Yeah.

1915
01:52:19,530 --> 01:52:23,520
This is crazy, man. Such a
good fight. I love this fight.

1916
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:27,780
Very excited. Can't believe it's about
to happen. This is the best feeling.

1917
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:29,650
Not the best, but it's a
great feeling. You know,

1918
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:34,050
like right before a big fight starts and
know it's going to go down. Woo. Boy.

1919
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:36,000
There's some about being there.

1920
01:52:36,001 --> 01:52:39,120
Live to the kids are extra
little kick when you're like,

1921
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:42,300
like cage side for Chris Weidman.

1922
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:47,000
Leo Machida right before that Shit
went down, I was just goose bumpy.

1923
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:50,330
My feet were like, my heels were
bobbing up and down. I was like,

1924
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:54,620
Oh shit. You know, jumping my
knees up and down. I was like,

1925
01:52:54,621 --> 01:52:56,390
oh my goodness.
Here we go.

1926
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,890
Especially a fight where you don't know
what the fuck is going to happen and

1927
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:05,390
then like this one, like the Machita
Weidman, fine man. I was blown away.

1928
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:09,470
Me Too. I've, I've never been so impressed
with a fighter with wide Nozick down.

1929
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:13,730
He's the truth. He's an animal, straight
animals. The tank ran through everything,

1930
01:53:13,731 --> 01:53:16,700
but she did throughout them.
Machida staggered him in the fifth round.

1931
01:53:16,701 --> 01:53:21,500
He's still waving him on like, come on,
that's a on champ. He's an animal man

1932
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,960
for his run is going to happen
while he's right now in his prime,

1933
01:53:26,961 --> 01:53:29,810
you know he's had his bass right now.
He's a tough guy to beat.

1934
01:53:30,190 --> 01:53:33,830
Super tough to beat for a long time.
Jock crazy. Could give them some issues.

1935
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:38,990
I think he's going to do well
against v Turriff that is next.

1936
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:42,590
I think vittores can have a
real problem with his hormones.

1937
01:53:42,591 --> 01:53:43,424
That's what I think too.

1938
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:45,480
Yeah.

1939
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,390
But if he doesn't, I think Luke
Rockhold can be a tough match. UPS One.

1940
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:52,680
Luke Rockhold is a tough matchup for
everybody. He's tough for everybody.

1941
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:57,420
He's the long, he's big. You know
he caught TRT RTV torn his prime.

1942
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:01,170
When you mean caught, you mean
when he kicked desire? Yeah,

1943
01:54:01,171 --> 01:54:05,220
when Vito kicked him in the head flew
18 hours to Brazil and got kicked in the

1944
01:54:05,221 --> 01:54:08,610
face. Yes. Yeah. I mean
he caught TRT. Victor,

1945
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:13,720
you don't want to be too or at
is very prime to go cal. Boy.

1946
01:54:14,010 --> 01:54:17,970
It's going to be interesting to see what
the differences is in his performance

1947
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:22,290
now to tell him he can't take testosterone
anymore. I agree. Very interesting.

1948
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:26,040
People don't think that's a big factor,
but you're applying day.

1949
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:29,970
It's a totally different world. Taking
a playbook from paint man, and be like,

1950
01:54:29,971 --> 01:54:32,490
yeah, let's see how he does. Well.

1951
01:54:32,491 --> 01:54:36,570
It's like changing your body structure
and giving your body the thing that it

1952
01:54:36,571 --> 01:54:40,230
needs to recover the most. And this is a
bunch of, especially at his age though.

1953
01:54:40,231 --> 01:54:44,070
Yeah, exactly. His age and you know,

1954
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:47,340
all those years of sparring
and screening and fighting,

1955
01:54:52,030 --> 01:54:54,490
here we go, baby. Ooh,

1956
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:59,110
powerful city that don't give a fuck.

1957
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:02,770
They all want this to be over.
So I go to white castle and get down.

1958
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:06,230
That's what they are. They're really
throwing down tonight. That bus,

1959
01:55:06,231 --> 01:55:10,810
not the fucking ham isn't the
leftovers. It's over. After this,

1960
01:55:10,811 --> 01:55:12,390
these motherfuckers are fired up.

1961
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:16,060
Isn't it funny that they put Vaseline
all over your face and then you grapple

1962
01:55:16,061 --> 01:55:21,061
and your head goes to guy's chest and
then your shoulders go to the guy's chest

1963
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:25,330
and then you got Vaseline on your
shoulders covered and then you know you're

1964
01:55:25,331 --> 01:55:26,590
both a scrambled on the ground,

1965
01:55:26,591 --> 01:55:30,100
so his back and you're back and
everybody's covered in Vaseline. True.

1966
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:32,780
I don't like how long cowboy shorter.

1967
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:36,910
You remember the old days when they used
to let the corners put Vaseline on for

1968
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:37,301
Phil?

1969
01:55:37,301 --> 01:55:42,190
Nurse do fill nurses rubbing it on
GSP chest and is in pretending like,

1970
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:44,650
oh, we're doing voodoo on a
bitch. You put Vaseline on it.

1971
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:48,060
You just put Vaseline on his face and
now you're coming up with some reason why

1972
01:55:48,061 --> 01:55:51,490
you need to do circles around his chest.
You're greasy ass hand

1973
01:55:53,330 --> 01:55:57,570
cause the he GSP was seeing this dude
who call himself the witch doctor and he

1974
01:55:57,571 --> 01:55:58,530
had all these weird things.

1975
01:55:58,531 --> 01:56:02,250
We'd line your shock where as you would
like they would rub the chest and touch

1976
01:56:02,251 --> 01:56:06,060
the back of your head and all this shit
work though the full, the undefeated,

1977
01:56:06,070 --> 01:56:09,660
it was
to the Voodoo killer.

1978
01:56:09,661 --> 01:56:14,010
Matt Serra said it was actually post
Matt Serra that he was doing all that.

1979
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:14,873
I it makes sense.

1980
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:16,640
Okay.

1981
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:17,900
You got the guy's number,
let me know.

1982
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:23,150
Well that's the one who's married
to his ex manager who's suing them.

1983
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:27,730
All right. They used to call
her on board the witch doctor.

1984
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:34,680
Powerful Dan Merkel, Yada Rock and
the gray beard like a gangster.

1985
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:37,530
Oh boy.
Here we go.

1986
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:39,993
Yeah.

1987
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:43,280
This is going to be interesting
too because is from New Jersey.

1988
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:47,980
Miller's from New Jersey cowboy's
a slow starter. Miller's not, yeah.

1989
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:51,320
Crazy local power energy
coming towards Jim Miller,

1990
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,390
the whole town of Sparta's in the house.

1991
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:57,960
Everyone's [inaudible] New Jersey
was again helion. He leaves school.

1992
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:02,190
That was a tough fight for
him. That's true. True.

1993
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:03,850
But they fought so and then he went,

1994
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:08,060
he went both bonuses then lost them to
piss pause for a marijuana positive for

1995
01:57:08,061 --> 01:57:12,650
marijuana. That was not a good fight
for Miller. No, that's right. Damn,

1996
01:57:12,651 --> 01:57:16,730
he's a two o $500 that's surprising.
Yeah.

1997
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:19,910
Well maybe it's because of that Pat
Heeley fight like that was the last time

1998
01:57:19,911 --> 01:57:21,560
they saw him here in New Jersey.
That's true.

1999
01:57:21,561 --> 01:57:25,790
But Pat helion dawn's thrown it at
completely different fighters. No doubt.

2000
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:30,470
No doubt. Yeah, completely different
styles. Completely different. Yeah.

2001
01:57:30,471 --> 01:57:33,620
Why do you think he wears those long
crazy shorts? He usually doesn't do that.

2002
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:35,870
I don't know what he's doing there.
Slid up the sizes.

2003
01:57:35,871 --> 01:57:39,080
I'm going to have a hard time kicking
with them, but my only issue ever,

2004
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:41,810
even if you get panelized,

2005
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:46,400
you're still grabbing like the short
and take someone down and say, hey shot,

2006
01:57:46,401 --> 01:57:50,030
don't grab the shorts. Oh,
cool. I'm in full amount.
Thanks Bro. Yeah, no, exactly.

2007
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,270
Exactly. Oh, it won't do it again.

2008
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,380
It's like when someone grabs
a fence to avoid to take down,

2009
01:57:54,381 --> 01:57:58,250
that should immediately be a point off.
Immediately be a point of view, point off,

2010
01:57:58,251 --> 01:58:00,500
or you starting out or you're
like, no, we're such it.

2011
01:58:00,501 --> 01:58:04,400
You need something along those lines
because you can't just allow someone to

2012
01:58:04,401 --> 01:58:07,890
stop a take down and then they land
a big shot. By the way, Joe say, Oh,

2013
01:58:07,891 --> 01:58:12,380
don't Chad Mendez. Exactly what happened.
Yep. I'll do grabs the cage then boom.

2014
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:15,740
Lens and needed the face of Mendez.
That fights can intense. Ooh,

2015
01:58:15,770 --> 01:58:19,190
they're talking a lot of shit.
He accused men does a pds. Right.

2016
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:22,000
And then Mendez accused him of
ped backing out of the fight.

2017
01:58:22,110 --> 01:58:25,430
He said he backed out of the fight right
after random drug testing was announced

2018
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:27,230
because he didn't want it.

2019
01:58:27,231 --> 01:58:29,850
Why do what you know happened to him
in the best mood whether we're going to

2020
01:58:29,851 --> 01:58:34,390
fight for it to get canceled. Who with
style fast. Yeah. Juice up the uh,

2021
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,690
interest in it. Cowboy. He's
got that nice knee to the body.

2022
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:39,740
It was just talking about that the nice
knee to the body does off that right leg.

2023
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:41,590
Only problem is with a guy.
This,

2024
01:58:41,591 --> 01:58:43,420
he's going to time that knee
and take them down eventually.

2025
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:48,280
Maybe that right is nasty though.
That needed the bodies is or hassle.

2026
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:50,960
It makes you hesitate on all your shot.
Fucking hurts man.

2027
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:55,540
And he did it again way again.
Big Left Doug. Oh good to the body

2028
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:01,190
can just needs to get a sweat on and get,

2029
01:59:01,250 --> 01:59:05,150
he needs to be about two minutes and
he'll be straight early. He scares me.

2030
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:10,730
Well he that early war with Barboza man,
that was fantastic.

2031
01:59:10,731 --> 01:59:13,340
That was my hit with the jab up
before that he was in trouble.

2032
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:17,630
Well he was getting caught but he looked
okay. I mean obviously he was fine,

2033
01:59:17,631 --> 01:59:20,480
but Barboza really tried to take
it to him. Barboza who knows?

2034
01:59:20,481 --> 01:59:23,540
The knock on him jumps on him and
Barboza works with Henry. Right.

2035
01:59:23,541 --> 01:59:26,060
There's that needed to,
well you know,

2036
01:59:26,061 --> 01:59:28,730
they know he's going to know
to jump on him. Oh yeah,

2037
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:31,280
so Miller's got him up
against the cage here.

2038
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:35,213
Okay.

2039
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:37,750
This is very interesting here. See? Oh,

2040
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:42,020
all Matt sharp knees,
knees and elbows. Yeah,

2041
01:59:42,021 --> 01:59:44,750
in the clinch.
Very sharp.

2042
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:51,100
Interesting though. The difference
between a guy like that. Oh there it is.

2043
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:53,600
There it, it'd be careful down down
here though. Like I said, he's tricky.

2044
01:59:53,601 --> 01:59:56,750
He's trying to set up but try and
go right now until he has oh nice.

2045
01:59:56,751 --> 02:00:01,430
Donald Gamble. Beautiful scramble.
Damn. Very nice. Risk Control.

2046
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:05,840
Straight. Threatened off the back and
then get that back up to his feet and the

2047
02:00:05,841 --> 02:00:06,674
transition.

2048
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:12,850
Oh Nice. Nice. Nice trait. Right?

2049
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:16,933
Another one

2050
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:21,590
cowboy for wilder was in Denver. Just
wrestling all the time. Wrestling nonstop.

2051
02:00:21,650 --> 02:00:25,520
Who was you're wrestling with? Uh, uh,
leaster bowling or old wrestling coach.

2052
02:00:25,521 --> 02:00:27,020
She and Carmen and my wrestling coach,

2053
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:31,970
I liked that he stops him with that
left knee just to create distance to put

2054
02:00:31,971 --> 02:00:35,690
space in between him and Miller.
It's very good at using his knees.

2055
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:38,150
It both authentically and defensively.

2056
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:41,000
He's like more authentic if
it seems with the right knee.

2057
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:43,400
But that left knee very good defensively.

2058
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:44,983
Ooh.

2059
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:51,460
Hey, right up that left hand. He's
faking the takedown coming up top.

2060
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:55,180
It could kick to the body by Miller.
This wrestling coach,

2061
02:00:55,181 --> 02:00:58,810
where does he coach out of um,
out a Mussel farm,

2062
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:03,310
Jim legit wrestling. Cause loss of
farm. Jim Looks pretty bad ass man.

2063
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:05,740
That's one of the places where
rampage trained back in the day,

2064
02:01:05,741 --> 02:01:09,030
right back in her day. And
now they lend it to the, the,

2065
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:13,230
I guess you'd call them really the uh,
elevation team with leaser bowling.

2066
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:17,020
It's like Nate more car, at least her
bowling. All those cans. Cody Donovan,

2067
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:21,130
Brandon Thatch. And so that's where Donald
goes to work on his wrestling. Yeah.

2068
02:01:21,131 --> 02:01:25,240
Well he was a year in, uh, two
years ago. Last time I was there.

2069
02:01:25,241 --> 02:01:27,550
He was there every day.
Does Donald's stay in Albuquerque?

2070
02:01:27,551 --> 02:01:32,230
Who does he live in Colorado? Um, I think
you'd live and he has a place in both.

2071
02:01:32,231 --> 02:01:37,231
I want to say he has the
ranch in Albuquerque where
he has a bunch of people in

2072
02:01:37,301 --> 02:01:40,190
farms and you know, dogs and shit. Cats.

2073
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:47,060
Damn Miller. Got To clench. Oh,

2074
02:01:47,061 --> 02:01:48,570
beautiful.
Take look at that.

2075
02:01:48,571 --> 02:01:53,390
He Card Wizard Roni back to the feed
knee to the body and the fucking clinch.

2076
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:55,783
Nice.

2077
02:01:57,950 --> 02:02:02,700
This fight has put Joey Diaz to
sleep. No, no, no. That's a word.

2078
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:05,960
What the fuck is going on? And this
is beautiful. That's a great fight.

2079
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:09,590
I just want calvary, which he is. I
just want it to get to the second round.

2080
02:02:09,591 --> 02:02:14,590
We're going to see some shit.
He's doing very well in this fight.

2081
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:16,790
Yeah. Miller struggling
with the, with the reach,

2082
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:19,920
the reach and also in closing,

2083
02:02:19,921 --> 02:02:22,490
and Donald has so many
weapons and in the transition,

2084
02:02:22,491 --> 02:02:24,290
so get 'em down and
Donald's not staying there.

2085
02:02:24,291 --> 02:02:28,070
He's moving right away to help him control
him. Damn. She was well, she got to do,

2086
02:02:28,110 --> 02:02:31,190
has a nice exchange right
there. He's also, Donald's
been able to get right back.

2087
02:02:31,191 --> 02:02:34,670
Oh, nice. Uppercut. Donald's being able
to get up to his feet. Look at this.

2088
02:02:34,671 --> 02:02:38,540
Donald's crabbing with him minute to
go to halls trying to take him down.

2089
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:42,350
This is nuts. The body lock. You
can try Gustin I'm pulling him off.

2090
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:45,980
That's a windbreaker, right? If Donald
gets him to the ground, starts bashing.

2091
02:02:45,981 --> 02:02:47,630
I'm really is.
When you're not thinking about it,

2092
02:02:47,631 --> 02:02:49,640
you that you didn't think it was common.
Yup.

2093
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:53,450
And he's so comfortable in the transitions
that he decides to try and take you

2094
02:02:53,451 --> 02:02:57,770
to the ground and constantly pressing
forward. Good. Good pressure.

2095
02:02:57,771 --> 02:02:58,604
By [inaudible].

2096
02:03:00,610 --> 02:03:01,443
Okay.

2097
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:05,010
Oh, good. Right hand by Miller. Nice
short, right hook. Five people. Oh,

2098
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:10,190
nice. Short right hook by
mail. I don't want this thing
to end early. We want this.

2099
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:13,990
We want this going fourth, fifth
round. Yeah, please. I want to fight.

2100
02:03:13,991 --> 02:03:16,460
I don't have shit to do.
Let's take this to the fifth.

2101
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:22,800
Oh Damn, that's right. I
forgot this was a five rounder.

2102
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:27,440
This is sir. Oh Man. Donald
starting to get to him. Beautiful.

2103
02:03:27,441 --> 02:03:31,610
First round. If you weren't
around for cowboy. That's it. Yes.

2104
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:35,990
I like how they keep the upper right
hand corner. They keep the fight on.

2105
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:40,460
That's pretty cool. Dope. So you
still get your commercials in,

2106
02:03:40,461 --> 02:03:44,990
but I get to see if anybody
quits in between rounds or
something happens off the

2107
02:03:44,991 --> 02:03:46,430
point.
Do a part in the body.

2108
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:54,070
Don't
rather this.

2109
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:57,420
What's the matter of Johnny? What do
you want the Lord to help you about?

2110
02:03:57,850 --> 02:04:01,590
Turn this little fucking
fight has a tremendous round
tell you that great fight.

2111
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:06,060
Yeah. That's kind of what I thought
was going to happen. Similar.

2112
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:09,830
I knew that Millie was getting, getting a
lot of shots again, but I had a feeling,

2113
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:12,270
don't worry, Bro. Patterns right
there. And we're here for you.

2114
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:20,050
Do, did you do to Du
du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du,

2115
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:25,160
du Du du Du du down [inaudible]

2116
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:38,820
did you, did you, did you
doubt? Oh yeah. There we go.

2117
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:51,160
That knee again. Fucking
needed. The bodies nasty.

2118
02:04:51,370 --> 02:04:55,750
He throws that so well. It just makes you
fat. It fucks up your timing coming in.

2119
02:04:56,230 --> 02:04:58,870
Ooh, nice leg kick. Two on a
good street. Right behind it.

2120
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:01,513
Okay.

2121
02:05:01,540 --> 02:05:02,890
Oh,
he's going up high.

2122
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:06,143
Okay.

2123
02:05:06,710 --> 02:05:08,300
Again, with that knee. I like how he,

2124
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:12,410
he drives forward with that knee
to good power in that right knee.

2125
02:05:13,790 --> 02:05:17,090
Donald's is starting
off this round strong.

2126
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:22,010
Another strong need of the body.
Oh good. Right. Kicked by Miller.

2127
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:28,070
Oh, front kick to the body. His
heart. He's heart. That's it. Oh Day.

2128
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:30,380
Okay.

2129
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:35,000
Well No, what? And Dan, he's saying it's a
grind shot. You saying it's a groin shot.

2130
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:40,400
Wow. That all sounds shot. Body
Shot, son. Look at, see, let's see.

2131
02:05:40,401 --> 02:05:44,570
Let's see. Let's it, I thought it was
a front kick to the body. Uh, yeah,

2132
02:05:44,571 --> 02:05:49,460
it did clip the cup on the way up, but
it's the body that God, oh my goodness.

2133
02:05:49,461 --> 02:05:51,170
They're going to keep the fight going,
Yo,

2134
02:05:51,171 --> 02:05:55,730
that is in five minutes or did
he say let's do it right now? No,

2135
02:05:55,731 --> 02:05:59,010
because he doesn't look
recovered. Dang. Donald had that.

2136
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,370
That'll mess with your mentality man.
When you think the fights over it.

2137
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:05,780
You know what I'm saying? Man.
I think that was a friend.
Ooh, great body kick. Yeah,

2138
02:06:05,781 --> 02:06:09,380
he's just going to go straight
to the body. He knows he's
hurting now. Oh, Jim's.

2139
02:06:09,690 --> 02:06:13,560
Jim's forced to kind of wrestle, you
know, front background front kicks it.

2140
02:06:13,561 --> 02:06:16,190
Comments on. Dang that like
kicking him. Beautiful.

2141
02:06:16,191 --> 02:06:20,780
Sidestep to a confident Donald.
Good luck with that.

2142
02:06:20,870 --> 02:06:23,360
What's he's feeling it like he is right
now and he's going to start getting

2143
02:06:23,361 --> 02:06:28,180
creative. What? Wow. I'm Ooh,

2144
02:06:28,181 --> 02:06:31,660
another front kick to the body,
man. I'm not happy with that doubt.

2145
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:35,260
That was a front kick to the body man and
mean kind of grazed the cup coming in.

2146
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:40,020
But it was the body shot that he
went down to. Yes. That's crazy. Wow.

2147
02:06:40,270 --> 02:06:43,270
How do you play that though? Cause
Dan thinks it's uh, uh, growing shot.

2148
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:46,420
I don't know. Can you do, you
can't let cowboy finish him off.

2149
02:06:46,510 --> 02:06:49,810
I think you have to watch the replay
and then he shows us a body shot.

2150
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:52,990
You stop it. You know it's
over for Donald. That makes
sense. Yeah. If Donald Wins.

2151
02:06:52,991 --> 02:06:56,920
Yeah. Yeah. If the replace showed that
what we saw, I say the fight stopped.

2152
02:06:56,950 --> 02:07:00,350
I agree. Cause that he would, he went
through it again. Now he's hurt. Ooh.

2153
02:07:00,370 --> 02:07:04,420
Through a big right hand.
He went to him again.

2154
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:10,510
Oh, he's just kidding. Hey, hey,
tomorrow's Jim Miller. Tough as shit.

2155
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:14,380
Jim Miller might still win this fight,
son. He might still win this fight.

2156
02:07:14,381 --> 02:07:17,140
Towns keeping me in there and can happen.
Oh Man.

2157
02:07:17,141 --> 02:07:21,730
Dom was lighting him up with that job.
We could show up right now.

2158
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:26,740
We'll look at his fucking Bon Jovi could
show up, but the whole bad right now.

2159
02:07:26,741 --> 02:07:31,310
And he's not even Bruce Springsteen
cage side could say that. Oh,

2160
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:32,260
we tried to switch kick.

2161
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:38,170
He's worried about that front.
The get down low. His hand is,

2162
02:07:38,210 --> 02:07:41,830
Donald's going to switch, kick him in
the face. I think. Well he just tried it.

2163
02:07:41,831 --> 02:07:46,500
Just try. But Miller uh, covered
it with his right shoulder. Ooh.

2164
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,700
Nice leg kick by Miller.

2165
02:07:50,690 --> 02:07:53,450
I can't run into anything cause de Mille
and tried to catch it with that right

2166
02:07:53,451 --> 02:07:57,940
hand man. His whole body, his whole body
just tagged. His organs are fucking,

2167
02:07:57,941 --> 02:08:00,910
Donald's going to switch it up.
Oh,

2168
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:04,910
but he's throwing a lot of kicks
to is I don't want this fight.

2169
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:08,740
I don't want it to end, but it think,
I think it should have ended me too.

2170
02:08:08,741 --> 02:08:13,570
But now that's not, I want,
I want Calloway to win. Just
not yet. That's a crazy,

2171
02:08:13,571 --> 02:08:16,480
a bad ref call. Horrible call. Ooh.

2172
02:08:16,510 --> 02:08:19,190
I liked that inside leg
kick me town's doing work.

2173
02:08:19,191 --> 02:08:20,600
It's the only thing
that's working for Millie.

2174
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:25,900
Oh.

2175
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:29,400
Oh.
Monjovi right now.

2176
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:33,880
Right now he's hearing fucking
slippery when wet backwards shot.

2177
02:08:34,570 --> 02:08:38,180
Oh my God.
He's not good in New Jersey.

2178
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:43,130
The band name the Brown.
Damn,

2179
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:47,810
that was spectacular. Oh, did they
just said Joe. So the shake his hand.

2180
02:08:47,811 --> 02:08:50,960
He's back on the hunt for fucking, that
was spectacular. Well, you know what,

2181
02:08:50,961 --> 02:08:55,370
Joe Silva is on the ball.
I'm sure he thought that that
first one was a stoppage.

2182
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:56,630
He should have stopped him.
That first one,

2183
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:58,520
Donald was just complaining
about something.

2184
02:08:58,610 --> 02:09:01,040
I think you said it should have been
stopped out and stopped. He's right.

2185
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:03,690
He's right. Look at this. Ooh.

2186
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:06,440
Set it up with the punch
that the shit is perfect.

2187
02:09:06,590 --> 02:09:11,310
That is a perfect shin to
the head. That was, he looked
low and kicking. Look, he's,

2188
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:15,250
he shielded it with the right hand.
Look at that blow.

2189
02:09:15,290 --> 02:09:19,520
That right hand was designed just to
stick out there and the Shin was coming

2190
02:09:19,521 --> 02:09:22,580
behind it the whole time.
Like as he was throwing that right hand,

2191
02:09:22,730 --> 02:09:25,370
he was already kicking.
Look, boom. See that?

2192
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:28,010
That wasn't like right hand misses land.
The Shin,

2193
02:09:28,011 --> 02:09:29,510
the right hand was just a set up.

2194
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:34,720
Just get a shot of yield to shield the
kick so he wouldn't see it completely

2195
02:09:34,731 --> 02:09:37,520
block the kick. He's throwing
it in the kicks right behind it.

2196
02:09:37,521 --> 02:09:40,640
He already knew he had fucked up too,
and he was mostly covering his body.

2197
02:09:41,030 --> 02:09:44,960
That was beautiful, man. That was
beautiful. God Damn, that was beautiful.

2198
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:49,850
Damn sick. Donald Cerrone's a
motherfucker. The kid's on fire.

2199
02:09:50,410 --> 02:09:54,920
Just straight fire. So
good man. He's so good.

2200
02:09:55,010 --> 02:09:59,510
So good. This is the Donald Serone like
focus, like you were saying, you know,

2201
02:09:59,820 --> 02:10:03,830
got his shit together. Powerful
Joe Diaz. Where are you at tonight?

2202
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:07,550
I'm fucking nowhere. I'm here
with you. I ain't got no gigs.

2203
02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:12,180
You want to come to the Improv? No, you're
taking half my spot. I want to watch you

2204
02:10:14,330 --> 02:10:18,860
do it for Joe. Yeah, I got it.

2205
02:10:19,190 --> 02:10:22,440
Yeah. I'm at the 10 o'clock show and I
got shorts on. I'm going to go home. Sure.

2206
02:10:22,441 --> 02:10:23,900
It's perfect.
I got to get up.

2207
02:10:23,901 --> 02:10:27,750
Gabriel Iglesias does this whole show
in shorts now. He's got a giant movie.

2208
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:33,280
He's a good dude, right?
He's one of those dudes.

2209
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:38,390
I don't know him real good, but everybody
is happy that he does well. Yeah.

2210
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:42,890
You don't hear anybody say bad things.
Solid fucking dude. How old is he?

2211
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:47,660
35 maybe 17 years.

2212
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:52,280
That's 34 yeah. Let's
find out. I'll say, yeah,

2213
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:54,340
34 maybe Gamebryo Brielle

2214
02:10:56,580 --> 02:11:01,060
you abl Iglesia yes.
Plus he's legit Mexican.

2215
02:11:01,061 --> 02:11:04,520
So the Mexicans are very excited.
You know,

2216
02:11:04,530 --> 02:11:08,190
they've got to look very bummed out with
men steal, yet they couldn't believe it.

2217
02:11:09,090 --> 02:11:09,923
37

2218
02:11:17,190 --> 02:11:21,360
yeah. Brian. Stan calling it
correct. Look at this. Boom.

2219
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:25,900
The way he covers it with that right
hand hides it with that right hand me.

2220
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:30,570
Those guys getting crazy good. I should
looking. Sure I beat him up that time.

2221
02:11:30,571 --> 02:11:31,320
I told you,

2222
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:34,470
I told you right after high school that
fucking God that don't went to science

2223
02:11:34,471 --> 02:11:35,304
class wounds.

2224
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:36,673
Damn.

2225
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:42,910
Yeah. New Jersey is bad luck for you, Jim
Malone type these firefights Lord. Hey,

2226
02:11:42,970 --> 02:11:45,610
he's a tough guy.
He's only gonna get better.

2227
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:50,650
Damn Bruce has on that three
piece talking to the three pieces.

2228
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:54,190
Make them a comeback. Devil apparently.
Where is um, Miller training?

2229
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:59,290
He's at his school, right in New Jersey.
Is that where he's training? Think so.

2230
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:04,870
Does he do Mark Henry and all, does
he with him at all? Never. Nope,

2231
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:07,960
but they're in the same town,
right? Are the same a part of those?

2232
02:12:08,230 --> 02:12:12,250
Where's mark hadn't Maria, he's in
New Jersey. He owns Pinos Pizza.

2233
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:15,580
He owns a pizza place. Yeah. Peanuts.
Pizza. It's like the best pizza.

2234
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:18,940
Where and what part of New Jersey?
Wow. I don't know what part,

2235
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,840
I'm not familiar with those
two. The bridge. Are you
close to the tunnel now? Okay.

2236
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:25,930
Can I was a kid the ways
out there was a peanuts.

2237
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:30,870
Are you close to a WHO's a Jujitsu Guy
in New Jersey? Ricardo. Amanda. Yes.

2238
02:12:31,770 --> 02:12:36,280
Him and Ricardo are like best friends.
Okay. Yeah. Frankie, uh, Ricardo,

2239
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:40,840
Frankie and Mark Henry on the squad and
they're like, that's the team there.

2240
02:12:41,110 --> 02:12:44,230
So Miller, his training in his own
place. Who gave me words? Black belt.

2241
02:12:44,740 --> 02:12:48,400
I'm not sure. Do you know
who he trains with? I don't.

2242
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:50,050
I thought it was his school.
Right?

2243
02:12:50,051 --> 02:12:53,620
It was him and his brother
doing work together. It's so
important, Brendan. Sharp.

2244
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:56,050
So important to be in the right
camp. Right? You're right.

2245
02:12:56,080 --> 02:13:00,050
That's what we were talking
to you about. Sun. True God.

2246
02:13:00,370 --> 02:13:01,840
That point and what I see,

2247
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:07,540
you know what you gotta do a camp that
makes you happy and what these people

2248
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:10,900
doing? Nothing like. I just read that
over marines with Greg. Jeff Jackson,

2249
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:12,730
you know,

2250
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:17,170
it's like Greg Jackson taking everybody
down there now the fucking save him a

2251
02:13:17,171 --> 02:13:20,620
camp over. It has been too many camps.
The fourth day you go, there you go.

2252
02:13:20,621 --> 02:13:22,840
Once you keep moving,
it's not the fight,

2253
02:13:23,050 --> 02:13:25,690
it's the fight or there's something
going on with the fighter.

2254
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:29,300
You know somebodies Tom,
him some he don't think he wants to hear.

2255
02:13:29,301 --> 02:13:31,030
It's something he can't take.

2256
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:35,190
There's something I don't like that
our camp is fucking really important.

2257
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:38,010
You can't take your own boss.
No. It's like a camp for comedy.

2258
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:42,090
You have your friends. You have three or
four friends that you throw shit around.

2259
02:13:42,091 --> 02:13:43,740
One of your friends will
tell you you're slipping.

2260
02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:48,990
That joke has been done before. That's
an old joke. You have your friend.

2261
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:53,820
That is true. That's our camp.
Your camp is a home. Once you know,

2262
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,660
when are you happiest? When your wife
is upset, when your wife is happy,

2263
02:13:58,350 --> 02:14:00,390
when are you fucking happy if you can.
You know what I'm saying?

2264
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:03,050
It depends on what you're looking at.
It depends on what you're looking at.

2265
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:07,290
Do Your House has to be happy. If you
had a fucking sign, some legal papers,

2266
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:11,790
it's like finally she's mad at me. Let's
end this. If your house is on decisive,

2267
02:14:11,791 --> 02:14:14,070
you are going to be undecisive
and that fuck, that is true.

2268
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:18,450
That's a great analogy. No, it's the
truth. It's true. It's true. You know,

2269
02:14:18,690 --> 02:14:19,970
confidence is,
is,

2270
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:24,070
you know what I've found that lately
at the age of 50 is Jesus fucked.

2271
02:14:24,071 --> 02:14:27,660
And I wish somebody told me
at 26 is guess what guys?

2272
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:32,550
Timing is everything. It's
everything. It's, it's, it's,

2273
02:14:32,610 --> 02:14:37,490
it's me doing the rights, scissor sweep
and Jujitsu to my joke, working Tim,

2274
02:14:37,491 --> 02:14:41,750
my punch working to me, uh, timing
and knee, you knowing the right time.

2275
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:46,120
Jesus fucking Christ. Timing
is fucking everything. Yeah.

2276
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:51,030
It really is remarkable in so many
ways that timing is, uh, is everything.

2277
02:14:51,510 --> 02:14:55,950
It's a lot. It's certainly a lot. I mean,
it's, it's about recognizing moments.

2278
02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:59,520
That's what's striking is all about
recognizing the correct moment, you know,

2279
02:14:59,521 --> 02:15:02,230
and the more you work on your technique,
the more you spar,

2280
02:15:02,231 --> 02:15:04,020
the more you get your timing down,

2281
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:07,790
the more you know how to recognize
the correct moment. You know?

2282
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:10,920
It's the thing with Jujitsu to
knowing the correct moment to move.

2283
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:14,970
Knowing the correct moment for
transitions. It's a lot to everything.

2284
02:15:15,390 --> 02:15:17,160
Conversations.
How bad is it?

2285
02:15:17,161 --> 02:15:20,130
Having a conversation with someone who
doesn't know when to shut the fuck up or

2286
02:15:20,131 --> 02:15:22,350
just ends every story. Mm. Oh yeah.

2287
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:25,230
Or every detail talks
over you while you're,

2288
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:29,490
the worst is when you're telling a story
and instead of responding to your story

2289
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:32,370
and talking about while that's crazy.
What were you thinking? What were you,

2290
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:35,370
what's going on with you, Brenden? They
just start telling a story of their own.

2291
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:38,400
It's completely unrelated.
Completely. And you're like, hey man,

2292
02:15:38,401 --> 02:15:41,640
will you not listening?
Like I just told you a crazy ass story.

2293
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:45,150
You don't even have any chin's. It's
offensive. We're not talking here.

2294
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:49,840
You're just using me as a fucking a wall.
The thrill rubber ball against, yeah,

2295
02:15:49,870 --> 02:15:52,200
yeah. Fuck yeah. Fuck, look, get it dog.

2296
02:15:54,460 --> 02:15:57,330
God Damn, he throws that
right. Neck kick. So good.

2297
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:03,030
Perfect to look at it.
Subtle Blam Shin,

2298
02:16:03,870 --> 02:16:07,920
all Shin floppy foot,
right around the neck.

2299
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:14,050
Damn credible fight.
Donald's run.

2300
02:16:14,051 --> 02:16:15,390
He's at his best of all time right now.

2301
02:16:15,391 --> 02:16:18,600
Right when you said don't want to fight
him. Yeah, he's on point right now.

2302
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:23,800
He's doing so many things.
Well is the last time we lost Angeles?

2303
02:16:24,890 --> 02:16:27,840
Yeah it does. Angela, just a little bit
ago, like really close for this year.

2304
02:16:27,841 --> 02:16:30,090
He lost this year too. Yeah. Does and just

2305
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:34,300
wrestled him. He was off
man. Yeah. Yeah. That was uh,

2306
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:35,380
that was an interesting fight.

2307
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:37,900
And then the Pettis fight
pet has caught him with that.

2308
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:41,800
Look at these mother fuckers bringing
Chris Lidell back and Chris Lidell good

2309
02:16:41,801 --> 02:16:45,970
analyst. He knows his shit. Smart Guy
was actually running for office. Diana.

2310
02:16:46,570 --> 02:16:49,870
Smart motherfucker. All those
guys are smart up there. Yeah,

2311
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:55,780
no doubt. No doubt. Kenny
Florian. I liked that Hanky.

2312
02:16:55,781 --> 02:17:00,010
Do you use it to blow your nose? Cause
I would blame you. That should be there.

2313
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:03,330
Yeah. If I have a Hanky look, good. Call
me. I got a nice Hanky and their teeth,

2314
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:04,121
you know,

2315
02:17:04,121 --> 02:17:07,750
I guarantee you this is some shit that
the UFC made for them like the UFC does

2316
02:17:07,751 --> 02:17:10,620
with me. Oh yeah, they got fitted.
They all got fitted for Syria.

2317
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:15,340
That's why I have suits the UFC
hooked it up. I have an issue.

2318
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:20,110
Look at powerful Chris Light,
although looking slick.

2319
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:25,360
Good to see him getting some, uh, some
love up there cause he's a smart dude.

2320
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:30,370
See this is where Randy really fucked
up taking that short money to go over to

2321
02:17:30,371 --> 02:17:33,570
that Bella Thor thing. He missed
out on this shit. All this stuff.

2322
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:37,030
He could have been an
analyst on Fox for ever.

2323
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:40,780
They would have loved to have him
on. It would've popped up. Randy.

2324
02:17:40,810 --> 02:17:41,710
Everyone loves Randy.

2325
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:45,940
They would have pumped up every movie
he did to take that short money and go

2326
02:17:45,941 --> 02:17:49,750
over to that Bella tour show,
which was not gonna last man.

2327
02:17:50,170 --> 02:17:53,140
There's not enough guys.
It's just too hard.

2328
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:55,630
Well who do you blame in that you
blame his manager, his friends.

2329
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:58,480
I don't blame anybody because I
don't have enough information.

2330
02:17:58,510 --> 02:17:59,620
If I talked to Dana White,

2331
02:17:59,621 --> 02:18:04,480
I'm most certainly going to get a story
that's in favor of Randy fucking up.

2332
02:18:04,630 --> 02:18:08,290
If I talked to Randy, maybe he'll say
that. You know he had to take the money.

2333
02:18:08,291 --> 02:18:10,720
He needs it. I don't know
who the fuck knows. Yeah.

2334
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:12,310
I'm not asking that idea though,

2335
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:15,820
but it's a bad idea for a guy like Randy
as a sport is growing and all these

2336
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:17,590
analysts positions. Who knows, man.

2337
02:18:17,591 --> 02:18:21,040
Maybe he doesn't like doing an analyst
positions too. That's also a possible,

2338
02:18:21,490 --> 02:18:26,260
I mean I think that's a possibility.
Of course. He's a movie star now. He's,

2339
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:30,160
you know, he's like world
renowned. He could do seminars.

2340
02:18:30,161 --> 02:18:33,400
You can do whatever he wants. Maybe he
doesn't want to wear a monkey suit. True.

2341
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:37,250
Maybe he'd be up there with his Bandana
on fucking weird bracelets and shit.

2342
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:40,120
Hope eventually chill. Sones
backup. We're doing this stuff.

2343
02:18:40,750 --> 02:18:44,050
Do you think that's the best?
Do you think that they'll take them back?

2344
02:18:44,590 --> 02:18:47,500
I think they can take it back. I
think you'd have to. How do you do it?

2345
02:18:47,650 --> 02:18:51,040
The country forgives everything.
It's how he approaches it.

2346
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:54,550
This is going to be how he approaches
this is all up to him. Well,

2347
02:18:54,551 --> 02:18:56,080
I'm sure the UFC wants them,
so I'm,

2348
02:18:56,081 --> 02:18:59,340
I'm sure at some point during an advise
them you need to do, you know, we need,

2349
02:18:59,410 --> 02:19:03,430
I don't know what you can advise though.
I think in Parkdale should die down.

2350
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:07,030
Yeah. Part of the issue is what do
you say? What do you tell them to do?

2351
02:19:07,031 --> 02:19:09,760
It's all just speculation. Like what's
going to make it go away quicker.

2352
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:14,350
I don't think there's any
time, time, time, time, but
it's not Michael Vick. Yeah,

2353
02:19:14,351 --> 02:19:18,160
but there's all they did. That's a
good point. Great. Michael Vick guys.

2354
02:19:18,161 --> 02:19:20,410
It's time and how you approach it.
I still haven't,

2355
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:22,600
I still has a lot of people that hate him,

2356
02:19:22,601 --> 02:19:27,110
but I'm still saying how
nobody's Haiti on shale. Hey,

2357
02:19:27,111 --> 02:19:27,944
this was a,

2358
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:31,310
this was very hard for Dana.
This is very hard for Fox.

2359
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:34,370
It was just something that, you know, bro,

2360
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:37,670
they wouldn't have let him go if
he didn't goof on people. Yeah.

2361
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:43,460
People he goofed on people when sometimes
if you live by the motherfucking sword,

2362
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:46,640
you die by the motherfucking shit.
Right in that regard.

2363
02:19:46,670 --> 02:19:49,490
I think they wouldn't let him go no
matter what goes on no matter what.

2364
02:19:49,491 --> 02:19:52,610
But you know, even the thing he
said about whatever gave him cancer,

2365
02:19:52,910 --> 02:19:56,120
he said a lot of fucked up things,
but he said he didn't say that.

2366
02:19:56,600 --> 02:20:00,290
A lot of shit was finally in a lot of
shit was if you would've said, well,

2367
02:20:00,291 --> 02:20:03,200
I would have said it, we would
have had props, man. You know,

2368
02:20:03,201 --> 02:20:07,220
he said a lot of fucked up shit and
uh, he knows this. He knows this.

2369
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:11,030
What made him a star though to, you know,
live by the sword, die by the sword.

2370
02:20:11,910 --> 02:20:13,040
He became damn

2371
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:17,300
this shit talker like late in his career.
Like he'd go to the early career. Oh,

2372
02:20:17,301 --> 02:20:22,060
like if all you see dog, macrame and Bodog
remember Brian, remember Bodog Yo. Yeah.

2373
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:26,900
Motorboat on some good fucking fights,
man. Fuck. Bodog Day, really fun.

2374
02:20:26,901 --> 02:20:29,860
Bodog member. Uh, Matt
Lindland versus fader.

2375
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:34,160
That might've been what brought Bodog
down through what they had to pay him like

2376
02:20:34,161 --> 02:20:37,280
$1 million to fight on the
Internet back when the Internet,

2377
02:20:37,281 --> 02:20:39,530
just like it was not smarter,
not there.

2378
02:20:39,710 --> 02:20:44,450
And then the homeboy Bodog ran the Bodog
betting website and that got shut down.

2379
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:47,420
Well not only did it get shut down,
but he is like a criminal.

2380
02:20:47,421 --> 02:20:51,560
He can't even come into the country
anymore because he was operating what they

2381
02:20:51,561 --> 02:20:53,720
deem to be an illegal gambling site.

2382
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:56,630
And so like Calvin Ayers was like,

2383
02:20:56,720 --> 02:21:01,130
he like had some thing with Dana white
where like he invited Dana said he would

2384
02:21:01,131 --> 02:21:06,020
pick them up on a private Jane,
a private jet and show him his lifestyle,

2385
02:21:06,230 --> 02:21:09,320
you know like cause it cause it you,
that Dana was jealous of him.

2386
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:10,400
This is what yeah,

2387
02:21:10,401 --> 02:21:14,780
this is like when Bodog was like competing
with the u s trying to yeah, way, way,

2388
02:21:14,781 --> 02:21:18,800
way, way back in the day. And you know,
Dana was like, dude, you're a criminal.

2389
02:21:18,801 --> 02:21:23,480
You can't even come to this country. I'm
going to hang out with you. You criminal.

2390
02:21:23,530 --> 02:21:26,450
And then, and then did, and
then after Bodog went down,

2391
02:21:26,451 --> 02:21:29,810
then that's when affliction
opened up and sign fade away. Yes.

2392
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:32,120
There was a billboard on Vegas.

2393
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:36,500
I'll never forget it as I was driving
in Calvin I or presents and it was him

2394
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:41,260
standing there like with a suit on. It was
like sunglasses on it, Shit. I was like,

2395
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:44,000
what am I looking at?
I love it.

2396
02:21:44,030 --> 02:21:46,780
He's advertising fights by
showing pictures of him himself,

2397
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:51,160
his ego so big and he's so fucking rude.
Well,

2398
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:55,550
you know when you're a baller like that
and also he's also promoting a brand

2399
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:59,270
right by by boat. He wants to
be Dana White. What do you want?

2400
02:21:59,300 --> 02:22:02,370
That's what he wants to do by putting
his face on the billboard and sort of a

2401
02:22:02,371 --> 02:22:05,480
back then Dana White wasn't even the Dana
white that you think of when you think

2402
02:22:05,481 --> 02:22:07,430
of him today.
You know today's a superstar.

2403
02:22:07,431 --> 02:22:12,080
Back then I don't believe he was nearly
as famous because MMA wasn't as famous.

2404
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:16,910
More of the transitionary period before
I'm a exploded. I think it was pre,

2405
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:18,103
I might be wrong,

2406
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:22,460
but I'm wanting to say it was pre ultimate
fighter or close and then affliction

2407
02:22:22,461 --> 02:22:27,461
came along just paying or Lawsky
or Rothwell v Toward Lynn.

2408
02:22:28,561 --> 02:22:32,220
Lynn take through some money,
son. They have some main one.

2409
02:22:32,221 --> 02:22:35,610
Legit showing them their family. We're
broke. Here's the fucking man right there.

2410
02:22:35,611 --> 02:22:38,910
And one 55 no one kicks
like that, dude. Ooh,

2411
02:22:39,570 --> 02:22:44,460
whoo. Tell you what, don't sleep by miles.
Jury number eight there. Now he's good.

2412
02:22:44,530 --> 02:22:49,160
He'll be, man, I'm telling you the matchup
no one wants. Is that Habib cat? Yeah,

2413
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:52,270
you're right. No one wants to
fight this beast. Horrible beings.

2414
02:22:52,290 --> 02:22:55,800
Just a bad match for everyone in the,
when you love to see him versus pedis.

2415
02:22:55,950 --> 02:23:00,030
Holt was shit. That'd be crazy. I would
really like to see what happens in that.

2416
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:03,120
Me Too. You know, I get
criticized for this all the time,

2417
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:07,570
but I'm gonna say it again. I think
that a guy like a, like a bad ass grin,

2418
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:09,840
which everybody says, Oh, you
know, I don't like watching him.

2419
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:14,190
I don't like watching and style. I want
to see him fight everybody. Really?

2420
02:23:14,630 --> 02:23:18,210
Because he's going to talk it up.
Just chill. Really? He is a child,

2421
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:22,310
a young child zone and that's what he is.
Better, better wrestling. Better. Right.

2422
02:23:22,420 --> 02:23:27,350
But I'm saying in MMA that's what he's
kind of going for now. Yeah, maybe he,

2423
02:23:27,351 --> 02:23:29,100
well he's going for piping things up,

2424
02:23:29,220 --> 02:23:32,160
but my point is just to forget about
is talking. If he never said a word.

2425
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:35,640
I want to see him fight everybody.
Oh, I want to see him fight Woodley.

2426
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:39,000
I want to see him fight. Rory. I
want to see him fight Nick Diaz.

2427
02:23:39,001 --> 02:23:43,070
I want to see what we can do to him and,
and,

2428
02:23:43,140 --> 02:23:45,750
and you're cool with him
just taking them down and,

2429
02:23:45,751 --> 02:23:48,370
and winning by a decision if he can do
it. Yeah. If he can do it. You're cool.

2430
02:23:49,090 --> 02:23:49,650
We're on the same,

2431
02:23:49,650 --> 02:23:52,020
I'm just saying people are going
to say that's not fighting though.

2432
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:56,310
So were you a fan of John Fitch? Yes. Yes.
I'm with you. Cause if you can't stop,

2433
02:23:56,311 --> 02:23:59,130
it's impressive. He's that good and
you can't stop it. It's a tactic.

2434
02:23:59,310 --> 02:24:00,810
And if you don't know how
to fight off your back,

2435
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:02,100
if you can't attack off your back,

2436
02:24:02,101 --> 02:24:04,290
get back up to your feet or
stop him from taking ground.

2437
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:06,090
It's super impressive cause you know,
hardest it.

2438
02:24:06,091 --> 02:24:09,610
Take some down and fuck
for 15 minutes or 25 yeah,

2439
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:14,450
and I get it folks, you know entertaining.
If you say you don't like that, I can't.

2440
02:24:14,970 --> 02:24:18,540
I guess I'm a bigger fan than you. I
just like the real deal. Well, well,

2441
02:24:18,541 --> 02:24:21,420
the difference is is is,
is you know what's going on.

2442
02:24:21,421 --> 02:24:23,190
You have a history of mixed martial arts.

2443
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:28,080
Those people just want to be entertained
when you get knocked out five times or

2444
02:24:28,081 --> 02:24:30,810
you win. You know what I'm saying? They
don't care how whoever gets knocked out,

2445
02:24:30,811 --> 02:24:32,910
that's all they want to see.
I think there's some mixed martial arts.

2446
02:24:32,990 --> 02:24:34,950
I'm being just completely facetious.

2447
02:24:34,951 --> 02:24:38,280
I think there's some legit mixed martial
arts fans that don't want to see that

2448
02:24:38,281 --> 02:24:41,040
ever and they were legit fans.
They want to see some action there.

2449
02:24:41,041 --> 02:24:43,020
They're the exception though.
But my,

2450
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:47,930
my point of view is that I'm a purist
and as a purist I need to see, oh,

2451
02:24:48,330 --> 02:24:50,310
I need to see all the possibilities.
Yes.

2452
02:24:50,311 --> 02:24:53,370
Like we would've never known that leg
kicks existed if someone didn't come along

2453
02:24:53,371 --> 02:24:54,660
and start throwing them.
You know,

2454
02:24:54,661 --> 02:24:58,590
you didn't know that a guy could choke
guys out like hoists Gracie did until he

2455
02:24:58,591 --> 02:24:59,370
came along.

2456
02:24:59,370 --> 02:25:02,610
So when a guy like asking comes around
and he'd just take everybody now and he

2457
02:25:02,611 --> 02:25:05,810
don't show not like that.
I don't think so.

2458
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:09,490
Not Fighting top top competition.
Exactly. Exactly. I know.

2459
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:14,580
But look what he did to guys that are
really good over there. Look over where?

2460
02:25:14,730 --> 02:25:16,840
Over where Bella Tor.
Yeah,

2461
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:20,350
but still still still whether you're
talking about sea level fighters,

2462
02:25:20,430 --> 02:25:24,730
I think B but yeah, some, some
deep. Sure. Some even a Chandler,

2463
02:25:24,910 --> 02:25:27,910
Eddie Alvarez. You're talking at a level,
right? They have some level for sure.

2464
02:25:28,010 --> 02:25:30,760
I'm not counting bell door.
I'm saying for the most part though,

2465
02:25:30,910 --> 02:25:35,260
Ben African isn't finding top
dogs so we don't know. Exactly.

2466
02:25:35,380 --> 02:25:38,800
So we got to see and the only one
way to see is to let them do it.

2467
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:42,040
Jump in though. Johnny Hendricks.
Fuck yeah. With anybody.

2468
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:45,460
Throw him in there with anybody. Really
good. You wouldn't want to see him.

2469
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:48,070
And you know, name the
beast. Hector lumbar.

2470
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:51,630
Jesus Louise's you're telling me you
wouldn't want to see Ben asking versus

2471
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:55,220
Hector Lombard to former
champs from Bella tour? Hey,

2472
02:25:55,221 --> 02:26:00,220
how can I think if a guys, if a guys that
dom at one position, it's dope to see,

2473
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:01,890
like everyone talks about the,

2474
02:26:01,970 --> 02:26:04,570
the super fight with George
Saint Pierre and Anderson Silva.

2475
02:26:04,930 --> 02:26:07,180
Hate to tell you that's not
going to be a fun fight,

2476
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:10,420
Georgia than lay on if they ever
did fight, which isn't happening.

2477
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:14,110
I'd say five for 25 minutes.
I just think GSP is laying on top.

2478
02:26:14,111 --> 02:26:15,790
I don't know if that
necessarily wouldn't happen.

2479
02:26:15,820 --> 02:26:18,970
I think that pride is a possibility of
George ever does decide to come back,

2480
02:26:18,971 --> 02:26:22,090
which who knows if he does and
Anderson is going to come back.

2481
02:26:22,390 --> 02:26:23,920
Anderson's already throwing kicks.
Yeah.

2482
02:26:23,921 --> 02:26:27,550
Have you seen that it a video of Anderson
punching the bag and he throws a kick

2483
02:26:27,580 --> 02:26:31,960
with that fucking leg slaps into
the bank. He goes, I don't know.

2484
02:26:31,970 --> 02:26:33,640
I think that fight does
happen and he'd get,

2485
02:26:33,850 --> 02:26:37,040
it's going to get market as biggest
fight ever in UFC history and everyone's

2486
02:26:37,041 --> 02:26:39,640
gonna be like, Damn Dog,
25 minute rest and clinic.

2487
02:26:39,670 --> 02:26:44,230
That's what I think you think so. Yup.
Be Interesting. Who knows? Who knows?

2488
02:26:46,030 --> 02:26:49,810
Who knows? But I don't want to see,
I want to see all styles. Dude,

2489
02:26:49,811 --> 02:26:51,760
I want to be too much.
For me,

2490
02:26:51,850 --> 02:26:55,840
it's very important to know what's
possible and there's only truly one way to

2491
02:26:55,841 --> 02:26:58,540
know what's possible is you got
to see those guys Duke it out.

2492
02:26:58,660 --> 02:27:00,280
You got to see the best guys Duke it out.

2493
02:27:00,310 --> 02:27:04,210
And when a guy is a champion of another
organization, like a belt or champion,

2494
02:27:04,211 --> 02:27:06,310
and he's been able to do
that to everybody over there,

2495
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:09,640
and he starts talking to a bunch of shit,
but the random man,

2496
02:27:09,830 --> 02:27:12,670
the way the UFC works, so they're not
going to bring you in having a fight,

2497
02:27:12,671 --> 02:27:14,440
Johnny Hendricks,
then bringing them in and be like,

2498
02:27:14,470 --> 02:27:19,340
take number seven Hector lumbar. How Fun
was that? We want to get destroyed. Yes,

2499
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:23,230
yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. I want
to just be dope. Yeah, I'm with Ya.

2500
02:27:23,290 --> 02:27:25,060
I want to see if he does and
I want to see if he doesn't,

2501
02:27:25,061 --> 02:27:28,510
if he can take lumbar down and molest
him for three rounds. Holy Shit.

2502
02:27:28,511 --> 02:27:32,140
That'd be wild to watch, man. Then we
got problems on wild to watch, man.

2503
02:27:32,141 --> 02:27:34,840
If you start, how old lasting
everybody's been? That's a good question.

2504
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:37,630
I would say Ramona and wow.
I'm going to take 30 ass.

2505
02:27:37,631 --> 02:27:40,400
I'm going to say 31 let's see.
Ben asked,

2506
02:27:45,070 --> 02:27:46,710
just turned 30

2507
02:27:47,050 --> 02:27:51,250
30
30 years is plenty.

2508
02:27:51,310 --> 02:27:54,070
Plenty of time. A lot of turns
tomorrow. Plenty of time.

2509
02:27:56,260 --> 02:28:00,100
Plenty belt are wrapped up
in that contract though. So
who knows if we'll see it.

2510
02:28:00,330 --> 02:28:04,550
Yeah. What's up with that? Huh? Cause they
know well, no one's trying to be like, oh,

2511
02:28:04,551 --> 02:28:07,630
I want to build toward champ
for life while he's out though.

2512
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:11,380
He's out of that contract. What is
it? The one fc now, right? Yeah.

2513
02:28:11,381 --> 02:28:16,240
Look at this to do a little demonstration.
Well, I see the socks. Candy,

2514
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:19,030
sweet,
sexy red sox.

2515
02:28:20,570 --> 02:28:21,380
Yeah.

2516
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:24,910
DC's just waiting for a shot. Right? He
had surgery, having surgery on his knee.

2517
02:28:24,970 --> 02:28:28,730
He doesn't know if he's going to have it.
He, um, he might not have the surgery,

2518
02:28:28,731 --> 02:28:32,560
he might just try to rehab it.
His ACL was only partially torn,

2519
02:28:32,580 --> 02:28:36,860
his MCL torn, so the MCL, he can
rest up and do therapy on it.

2520
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:38,510
He's a,
you know,

2521
02:28:38,511 --> 02:28:42,230
it's 36 years old and he's concerned with
taking a full year off because that is

2522
02:28:42,231 --> 02:28:47,080
what is going to happen. And then jumping
in though Jon Jones Gethsemane. Yeah,

2523
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:49,820
whoever wins. Yes. Or you know, who knows.

2524
02:28:49,821 --> 02:28:54,260
But by then if he gets surgery and
then the landscape changes in a year,

2525
02:28:54,261 --> 02:28:56,840
then maybe he's fighting Glover
or maybe it's fighting, you know,

2526
02:28:56,841 --> 02:29:00,590
who knows who he's fighting. He needs
to just wait for us title shot. Well,

2527
02:29:00,591 --> 02:29:02,060
it depends on how good his knee is though.

2528
02:29:02,061 --> 02:29:05,960
Because what if he waits for the title
shot and his knee is bunk and it goes out

2529
02:29:05,961 --> 02:29:09,650
in the first round and he could've just
waited an extra six months after that,

2530
02:29:09,651 --> 02:29:14,470
let somebody else fight and then
fought John with 100% I think.

2531
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:17,870
No. As long as your foe, your
next fight for the title.

2532
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:22,470
Once you're in line for the title, don't
do anything. Don't do surgery. Well, no,

2533
02:29:22,471 --> 02:29:25,940
I'm saying don't take any other fights.
Right? Like don't, don't get surgery.

2534
02:29:25,941 --> 02:29:28,700
Then they'd be like, all right, well we're
going to toss you glow over. Beat him.

2535
02:29:28,701 --> 02:29:29,850
Then we're going to give it to,
nope.

2536
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:32,030
What do you think about
we're doing and cane. That's,

2537
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:35,690
that's a tough match up for
cane. You think so? I really
do, man. Really? You know,

2538
02:29:35,691 --> 02:29:40,130
I'm always pro Jitsu. I just think for
doom, if you've ever seen that dude off.

2539
02:29:40,131 --> 02:29:44,240
See you have, he's huge. He's like
six, six. You know what I'm saying?

2540
02:29:44,390 --> 02:29:48,350
He's a big dude. Legit,
dangerous striking. Oh, and Kane,

2541
02:29:48,470 --> 02:29:50,260
he's gonna throw those elbows and uh,

2542
02:29:50,350 --> 02:29:53,270
that Cordelia teaching them all that
stuff and the knees and you want to take

2543
02:29:53,271 --> 02:29:54,104
them down off that.

2544
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:57,410
Will the ball hit his fight starts
once his back hits the ground.

2545
02:29:57,890 --> 02:30:02,570
We're not talking about junior dos Santos
on the ground. Check Congo, a big foot.

2546
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:03,530
No son.

2547
02:30:03,650 --> 02:30:07,310
We're talking about their very best
pure Brazilian Jujitsu artists and the

2548
02:30:07,311 --> 02:30:10,590
heavyweight division on his back
without a doubt. Without a doubt. And,

2549
02:30:10,630 --> 02:30:14,720
and also if I'm reduced corner
and I'm saying, all right son,

2550
02:30:14,721 --> 02:30:16,970
if he's doing what he did to judo,

2551
02:30:16,971 --> 02:30:20,660
Santos and he puts his forehead in your
chest and he's dirty boxing against the

2552
02:30:20,661 --> 02:30:23,180
cage, if that's going on
for a long amount of time,

2553
02:30:23,270 --> 02:30:25,100
you're jumping half guard mixed things up.

2554
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:27,740
We're not going to stay in and get our
ass whooped. Like Junior dos Santos dead.

2555
02:30:28,010 --> 02:30:30,500
You're going to half guard. You look to
sweep, you're looking for submissions.

2556
02:30:30,850 --> 02:30:34,580
Very interesting. Very
interesting. I don't, I don't
know. I'm, I'm all about it.

2557
02:30:34,580 --> 02:30:36,290
I just, I believe in for, and this one,

2558
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:40,910
could you imagine ever doing taps
him in Mexico? What? Oh, good Lord.

2559
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:43,790
And then they find out we're doomed.
Speaks better English or better Spanish.

2560
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:46,850
The same. You'd have the biggest
heavyweight stars since Brock Lesnar.

2561
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:51,740
You think so? Yup. Why do you think that?
Why do you think it would be so big? Uh,

2562
02:30:51,770 --> 02:30:55,730
he has a personality. He's bilingual.
We're just going into Mexico.

2563
02:30:55,731 --> 02:31:00,620
He's a tough on a, he's a coach on
tough in Mexico. It very well spoken.

2564
02:31:00,621 --> 02:31:04,820
Good looking dude. Legit
legit skills. Listen,

2565
02:31:04,821 --> 02:31:07,310
Keynes is number one,
the world number one bad ass in the world,

2566
02:31:07,610 --> 02:31:10,280
but personality wise it's just not there.
You know what I'm saying?

2567
02:31:10,281 --> 02:31:12,110
And for doom as a personality match it.
Well,

2568
02:31:12,111 --> 02:31:16,640
you know the other thing about Cain
that he got to deal with is that cardio

2569
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:20,280
cardio is off the chain
is no one like him.

2570
02:31:20,730 --> 02:31:23,220
Motherfucker doesn't get
tired or if he does get tired,

2571
02:31:23,221 --> 02:31:26,370
it is not like everybody else
can. It keeps going. It's crazy.

2572
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:28,530
But if you've ever doom,
all right man, cool.

2573
02:31:28,710 --> 02:31:30,660
You're starting to get a little
tired and getting your ass what?

2574
02:31:30,661 --> 02:31:32,580
The first two rounds,
dirty boxing the cage.

2575
02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:35,790
We're taking us to the ground because
you're not going to sit there for five

2576
02:31:35,791 --> 02:31:38,400
minutes while you just wear your ass out.
Then we're in the fourth round.

2577
02:31:38,401 --> 02:31:41,190
You getting t code, you know what
I'm saying? That's very interesting.

2578
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:43,770
That's very interesting.
It's weird. I could see,

2579
02:31:43,771 --> 02:31:46,950
you know like a crazy transition going
on on the ground where he's threatening

2580
02:31:46,951 --> 02:31:51,080
to you think of what he did to fade army
fado was trying that brutal ground and

2581
02:31:51,081 --> 02:31:55,350
pound that he uses on everybody.
Yeah, we're doing was like wrap it up,

2582
02:31:56,970 --> 02:31:57,721
snap, snap, snap,

2583
02:31:57,721 --> 02:32:00,840
snap and we're not talking about fate
or with the love handles like crazy

2584
02:32:00,841 --> 02:32:03,970
hanging over the muffin top. We're talking
about fiddle. Everyone was like, what?

2585
02:32:04,020 --> 02:32:07,380
See that's where I kind of disagree
with you because I think that fader was

2586
02:32:07,381 --> 02:32:12,240
already slightly on the slide slightly
but not big foot style where you're like

2587
02:32:12,241 --> 02:32:13,540
damn,
someone tossed in the towel.

2588
02:32:13,541 --> 02:32:16,740
We had knocked out Brett Rogers and that
fight before that looked great in that

2589
02:32:16,741 --> 02:32:17,101
fight,

2590
02:32:17,101 --> 02:32:20,840
but he was tested in that fight a little
bit with Rogers right hand and drop

2591
02:32:20,850 --> 02:32:25,230
tied hand and the reality of Brett Rogers
skill was at fate or shouldn't have

2592
02:32:25,231 --> 02:32:29,280
been tested by him, but no should
walk them. He's just not the same guy.

2593
02:32:29,281 --> 02:32:33,000
I don't believe that fade or is the
same guy is the fade or the [inaudible]

2594
02:32:33,001 --> 02:32:35,550
Fujita the fade or that fought cro cop,

2595
02:32:35,551 --> 02:32:38,430
the female or the fought
Nogueira is a different faith or,

2596
02:32:38,431 --> 02:32:40,860
cause I think he had been
through all the wars.

2597
02:32:40,861 --> 02:32:45,510
You've gotten divorced in America.
A lot of shit body changed his body.

2598
02:32:45,550 --> 02:32:47,280
He stopped being big and muscular.

2599
02:32:47,570 --> 02:32:50,140
If you look at those old fights
when he was doing strength training,

2600
02:32:50,210 --> 02:32:53,520
doing like weights and strength
conditioning training, he was way bigger,

2601
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:56,250
way more physically imposing.
He was always,

2602
02:32:56,280 --> 02:32:59,220
he always had a little bit
of a gut always, but he
didn't give a fuck, you know,

2603
02:32:59,221 --> 02:33:02,430
but, but he was bigger than the
shoulders. Bigger than neck and the chest.

2604
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:05,610
And then as he got older like it is,
he fought like Dan Henderson.

2605
02:33:05,611 --> 02:33:07,380
He lost a lot of that bulk cause true.

2606
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:13,160
She's probably just didn't want to do
the weightlifting. Even even when, uh,

2607
02:33:13,860 --> 02:33:16,560
he fought for doom, he
was still scary dude, man.

2608
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:20,040
Someone for doing pulled that off.
The difference between faders,

2609
02:33:20,041 --> 02:33:22,020
ground and pounding Keynes's canes.

2610
02:33:22,021 --> 02:33:26,130
Very calculated and very smart fade or
believed in it so much. He was just wild.

2611
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:28,920
So that triangle is like snap son sort of.

2612
02:33:28,921 --> 02:33:32,040
But I really think that fader was gone
because then you see the fate or fight

2613
02:33:32,041 --> 02:33:32,700
with big foot.

2614
02:33:32,700 --> 02:33:36,120
Think about what Kane did the big foot
and then watch that fade or fight with

2615
02:33:36,121 --> 02:33:39,570
big foot and be like feta was never
really in that fight. It was a mess.

2616
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:41,920
It was horrible. I thought they were
going to toss in the towel. Yeah. When?

2617
02:33:42,030 --> 02:33:46,060
When Kane was or when fader was on his
back and big foot mounted him. I was like,

2618
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:50,220
oh, there's like two different, it looked
like three different weight classes.

2619
02:33:50,530 --> 02:33:54,870
He's not be able, Dan big foot's a
building man. You say months. Enormous.

2620
02:33:54,871 --> 02:33:58,180
Enormous guy when joint ma,

2621
02:33:59,910 --> 02:34:03,840
but speed if you can put chills
them. Yeah. If you can catch him,

2622
02:34:03,841 --> 02:34:07,230
that's how call me a lit them up.
That's how, that's how Cain got them.

2623
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:09,840
Everybody gets him with speed.
You have to close the deal.

2624
02:34:09,841 --> 02:34:13,970
She going to do crack them. Yeah.
You have to. Yeah. Dumped home.

2625
02:34:13,971 --> 02:34:18,020
The holder in Brown Johnson who uh,

2626
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:22,600
oh my goodness. That's going to be
fun. Here's that fucking crazy Combo,

2627

2628
02:34:26,750 --> 02:34:29,560
