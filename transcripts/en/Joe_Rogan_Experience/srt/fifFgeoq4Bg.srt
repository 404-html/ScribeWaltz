1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,950
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,083
She's been on the road.

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,061
Not really,

4
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,490
I mean a little bit here and there

5
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,053
satellite.

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,930
It was fun later for the UFC,

7
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:40,560
so,

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,393
okay.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,320
Oh yeah.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,530
Thanks for the offer on our land.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,060
Dismissed you there.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,670
We were out of there about four
days before you made a great,

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:54,961
well,

14
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,970
you know that guy cow had in Tampa.

15
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,143
Okay,

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,591
great.

17
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,424
Did said he,

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,350
he decided he syndicating,

19
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:06,150
so he decided that he's gonna change
his name to his real name is might call

20
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:06,930
tech.

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,370
So you get rid of cow head.

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,300
Right,

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,133
right.

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,580
Well,

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,670
so they did a roast for
him as it was a benefit,

26
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,700
but the idea was that
everybody was saying like,

27
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,950
this is your only fucking equity of like,

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,813
dude,

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,893
you know.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,790
And so,

31
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,623
uh,

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,660
so it was me,

33
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,830
Jim Norton,

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,650
Bert Kreischer Florentine,

35
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,903
um,

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,540
uh,

37
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,440
Bobby Kelly,

38
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,850
we all flew down for it.

39
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,780
No Shit.

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,051
Yeah.

41
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:34,861
But they said,

42
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,071
you know,

43
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,630
come down and uh,

44
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,600
from your family will be
tickets to every theme park.

45
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,370
We stayed dead.

46
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,270
That's a scratch.

47
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,021
So,

48
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:43,740
um,

49
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,110
so we went to universal days.

50
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,010
They push guards all with like the fast
pass or you go to the front of the line.

51
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,840
Got Us great hotel fluid solve in.

52
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,883
Oh it was great.

53
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,520
And then my sister was down
in Florida visiting my mom's.

54
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,330
So then we just,

55
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,140
we made a vacation and I spent
a week at my mom's after that.

56
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,750
So it was a good trip.

57
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,130
Yeah.

58
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,780
But I,

59
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,320
I fucked it.

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,680
Tweak my neck on some relativists
digital really bad knees.

61
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,330
Busch gardens is like,

62
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,100
if you're into roller coasters,

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,550
it's,

64
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,950
they've down like it does enough,

65
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:20,010
the most hardcore roller coasters and
the country and they're like 400 foot

66
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,160
straight drops and
corkscrews and you know,

67
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,270
and I was into it,

68
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:27,990
but down on the second to
last one I felt something.

69
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,390
And then I spent at my mom's house,

70
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:31,470
I literally this,

71
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,830
this is my rotation for the
entire week at my mom's house,

72
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:34,980
man.

73
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,690
I went to the chiropractor twice.

74
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,770
If that ever happens,

75
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,200
forget the our Mukund deep tissue massage.

76
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,711
Yeah,

77
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:41,910
loosen up to soft tissue.

78
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,631
That's almost all.

79
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:43,530
But really,

80
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:43,771
yeah,

81
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:44,001
I mean,

82
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:46,770
and I've had come through a series
of back injuries over the last year,

83
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,780
and one of the things that I've found
is a lot of chiropractic is bullshit.

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,833
Why?

85
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,580
And Not really recognized by
science or medicine either.

86
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,440
It's a broad word design.

87
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,970
Even one type of chiropractor.

88
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,260
You get guys that you all
different kinds of shit.

89
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:02,501
Yeah.

90
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,000
The guy who went to wasn't great.

91
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,250
I just felt like I needed something.

92
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I was going to get a massage bits
place in town is clearly I would fell.

93
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,490
It's just too weird to do
that with my staff on my mom's

94
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,280
home.

95
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,113
Quite good.

96
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,040
No therapeutic.

97
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,420
Okay.

98
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,010
Don't walk on my back and
it's gonna make it worse.

99
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,350
You read some indeed that,

100
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,453
yeah.

101
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,961
If,

102
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,290
if she's light is great,

103
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,790
but some of these fucking cows,

104
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,120
they're,

105
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,953
you know,

106
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,360
they're 50 years old and
I put on a few pounds,

107
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,940
like just,

108
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,830
we am good.

109
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,161
Yeah.

110
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,240
I went to a time slash place.

111
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,050
They did that.

112
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,500
Okay.

113
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,333
Yeah.

114
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,633
Yeah.

115
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,750
High school fee is a little Asian.

116
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,341
Yeah.

117
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:57,174
That's my thing.

118
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,940
Here's the thing,

119
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,400
what a weird thing.

120
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,200
It's just so random.

121
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,603
Suck.

122
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,583
Right?

123
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:16,711
No,

124
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:17,840
I don't sir.

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,800
Take a lot of handed packs and you
start getting depressed and it's uh,

126
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,550
it's the dirty secret of combat
sports that most of those guys,

127
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,070
when you hear all that positive talk,

128
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,740
it's not just a pump
themselves up for fights.

129
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,390
It's tough to try to push away the demons.

130
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,140
Sure.

131
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,390
That are in their consciousness
because of depression.

132
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,180
And the other thing that
goes along with that,

133
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,910
a lot of times they'd rather
combative and argumentative.

134
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,840
That's a way of getting
serotonin levels go on,

135
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,610
creating some type of little argumentive
thing and then he'd get like,

136
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:53,971
oh,

137
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:57,900
the accompany right hormones ago
along with that argument of nature.

138
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,141
Yeah.

139
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:58,891
Like me right now,

140
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,590
like I'm all fired up
above his fucking yeah.

141
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,191
Yeah.

142
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:03,090
But you didn't have a likable,

143
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:05,210
you didn't take the punches
to the head like no.

144
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:05,670
Yeah,

145
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,890
there's no punches to the dead.

146
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,180
And I was just reading today about this
whole dirty drug thing going on in the

147
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:14,274
NFL,

148
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,470
how they just pumped these guys pull up
painkillers for years and all lady came,

149
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,393
oh yeah.

150
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,000
Parking set everything.

151
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,080
If I could in and I mean just on and on
and on and just tons of this stuff and

152
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:26,070
these guys are suffering.

153
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,120
We know failure,

154
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,920
so it's horrific,

155
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,461
horrific,

156
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:30,294
horrific stuff.

157
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,133
I mean,

158
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,770
I don't know if you had a son
but you want him to play for,

159
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,100
I would not have that happen.

160
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:35,520
Fight.

161
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,230
I'd rather have my kid fuck
cause I think that's a teacher.

162
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,660
Kids judo,

163
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,590
any day over football and you could
fight intelligently and you could have a

164
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:44,424
good camp.

165
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,270
Let's listen.

166
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,590
We could talk about that on the podcast.

167
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:46,791
Yeah,

168
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,624
that's actually a good thing.

169
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,093
Let's do it Jeremy.

170
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,320
Yeah,

171
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,270
I mean it's brutal now.

172
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,210
There's like over 500
players suing the NFL.

173
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,011
Yeah.

174
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:58,791
What's talking about that?

175
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,624
Let's talk about that.

176
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,560
Has the drawback changed?

177
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,300
It makes it a little bit slower.

178
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,570
It's such a powerful photo.

179
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,251
It doesn't matter,

180
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,080
but it makes it more accurate.

181
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,100
It makes it easier to,

182
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,020
as long as,

183
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,953
yeah,

184
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,940
they got a national,

185
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:26,774
she's,

186
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,281
yeah,

187
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,114
no totally.

188
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,410
This is different but it's
super accurate because of that.

189
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,390
What I have to do.

190
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,680
The reason why I brought it here as I
have a chronograph and the back that tells

191
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:47,681
me the exact speed and then you
have to calculate how fast he,

192
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:49,064
uh,

193
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,880
the car was going to travel and that
will let you put in what's called a sight

194
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,010
tape site

195
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,220
piece of equipment,

196
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,620
like a work of art.

197
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,140
This is a pretty rare one because this
is a 90 pound bow hold back or 90 pound

198
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:15,110
bow.

199
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,990
So it's very rare

200
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,680
they don't make them.

201
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,370
So I see the way it's curved.

202
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,250
So you can only pull it back with one.

203
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,940
I can pull up with your right.

204
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,013
Yes.

205
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:30,771
Yeah,

206
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:31,604
exactly.

207
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,170
This is a stabilizer,

208
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,920
attach this on to it nicely
and then wants to stabilize

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,530
this,

210
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,363
this

211
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,863
site.

212
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,193
Yeah.

213
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:49,550
Yeah.

214
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,720
This is the stabilizer.

215
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,510
This sort of helps balance
it out while you're shooting.

216
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,630
And this year that's a site.

217
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,880
This is a hell of a weapon.

218
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:02,871
Yeah.

219
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:03,890
This is no joke.

220
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,600
Well,

221
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,590
my thought is if you're going hunting you,

222
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,270
um,

223
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,360
well you really helped me.

224
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,021
Yeah.

225
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:16,340
You really should use the most
powerful thing that you can and did.

226
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:20,210
The issue really is that
a lot of people think,

227
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:20,600
you know,

228
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,871
hey,

229
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,480
if you know you don't
need that kind of power.

230
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,180
And they,

231
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,200
there's a lot of criticism
in the bow community,

232
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:32,201
the archery community of people who
use like really heavy pound bowls,

233
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,611
they think that,

234
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:34,761
you know,

235
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:38,090
you're being a meathead and
it's not necessary and you're,

236
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:39,440
you're over bode,

237
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:39,801
you know,

238
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,850
you don't need that much bow.

239
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,683
But

240
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,330
I've kind of thought that through.

241
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:46,670
I think what's a regular guy?

242
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,080
What strong to a regular guy is not that
strong to a person who lives a lot of

243
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:51,430
weights.

244
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,680
Yeah.

245
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,513
For sure.

246
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,360
Straight as revenue.

247
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,201
Yeah.

248
00:08:55,201 --> 00:09:00,201
For me to use a 90 pound ball and a guy
who is weak to use a 60 like why does he

249
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:00,830
think that?

250
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,570
That this is harder for me to use it.

251
00:09:02,571 --> 00:09:06,090
It is for him to use a 60 like
if you don't lift a lot of ways.

252
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,223
Yeah.

253
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,100
So,

254
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,940
but it's so weird.

255
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,221
Like he,

256
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:09,371
it's,

257
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:10,141
it's weird,

258
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,640
this ego thing that goes on,

259
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,650
it's weird criticism thing like,

260
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:14,610
oh that's old.

261
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:15,361
That's great guy.

262
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,320
You don't need that.

263
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,041
Why do you use that?

264
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:17,730
You don't need to,

265
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,560
but I really think it's
because they can't do it.

266
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,480
So they have this weird thing there have,

267
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,330
I personally wouldn't want to go.

268
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,750
That would be as powerful as
I could possibly 12 but yeah.

269
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,561
Well come on over here.

270
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,920
I'll show you how you use the chronograph
in worse than maybe an animal.

271
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Can I put the site tape on his,

272
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,401
that was his,

273
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:38,160
his 20 yards.

274
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,361
Yeah.

275
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:39,420
This from here.

276
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,171
All right.

277
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,004
From this,

278
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,150
he's pretty far off man.

279
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,770
No real shot or Vr.

280
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,863
It's really weird.

281
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,660
Is any movement at all

282
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,393
football?

283
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,690
This is cause we're in the door.

284
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,703
Yeah.

285
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,900
So there's a lot of trial and error.

286
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,933
Yeah.

287
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,030
So lots of really long shot then.

288
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,010
What's that?

289
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,330
What's a real long shot?

290
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,650
I mean what's considered a long longtime?

291
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,720
Anything over 40 the real,

292
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,850
real marsh or real archer

293
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,930
just keep that's right.

294
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,093
Yeah.

295
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,780
So I'll do this for hours once I get home.

296
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,700
This is kind of shooting her name.

297
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,640
[inaudible]

298
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,123
yeah,

299
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,963
once you get,

300
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,360
once you get the swing of it.

301
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,490
So interesting.

302
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,060
Because one year cross train on the shot,

303
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,960
once you're locked in,

304
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,430
the world goes away.

305
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,490
[inaudible].
