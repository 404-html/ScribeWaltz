1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,800
Jamie,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,820
you.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,150
Oh Philip the Franco.
Alright,

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,640
I'm good man.
It's cracking.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,730
I'm good.
Although all the conversation we had 

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,470
right before to be the good stuff and 
then all of this could be two hours of 

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:21,470
bad.
Yeah.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,741
We shit on some movies and got,
got mad about Republicans and talking 

9
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:27,180
and then we gotten mad about Democrats.
And you're putting.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,100
You're putting away in an I statement.
Yep.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,130
That was us.
I was just,

12
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:34,560
I was just being your therapist man.
Thanks dude.

13
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,210
Sweet.
So sweet of you.

14
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,320
Isn't that what a podcast is?
Just like,

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,570
let me,
let me hear what you're saying,

16
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,330
but then let me,
let me talk about the world in a way.

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,800
Yeah.
Is that a phone?

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,100
That's a tiny little tiny one man.
But you get the little tiny iphone.

19
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,300
Yeah.
This is.

20
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:51,510
This is for my daily example of why I 
need to be patient.

21
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,660
I had an iphone six plus the biggest 
storage I was.

22
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:56,070
I was really happy with it and I was 
like,

23
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:57,810
man,
I need to get that iphone seven.

24
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,420
And the only one they had was the small 
one with the smallest storage and it's,

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,300
it's a piece of garbage,
you know?

26
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:05,400
I know.
Well just because I'm like,

27
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:06,660
you know,
I don't need that much storage,

28
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:11,661
I'll use the cloud,
but I don't because I don't trust the 

29
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:11,661
cloud.
So I cared of all those Dick Pics,

30
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:16,611
getting all the Dick pics kegs of them.
I think that's the good thing about not 

31
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,500
being extraordinary in any way.
I'm not doing that.

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,930
Like you don't have to worry about your 
dirt.

33
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,990
No one needs to see it.
So you just ran out of,

34
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,530
what is it like a 32 gigabyte or 
something?

35
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:26,890
Yeah.
No,

36
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,090
it's like I have to.
I'm like,

37
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,710
which memory will I delete before I 
make.

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,450
It makes me be a little bit selective,
but I don't know.

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,290
In this day and age of stupid,
does it bother you that it's small?

40
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,020
Not as much,
but you get used to it,

41
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,610
right?
What do you have?

42
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,530
Yeah,
I have the seven plus man.

43
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,650
Do you use that?
When you look at websites in particular 

44
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,410
where you don't have to expand the 
screen to get the entire thing,

45
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:54,411
you don't have to go back and forth to 
get the entire article and there's 

46
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:54,750
little tricks that people don't know 
where it's like you just double tap,

47
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,780
not pushing,
but double tap and like all that shit 

48
00:01:59,780 --> 00:01:59,900
that's on the top of the screen that 
comes down for you [inaudible].

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,620
They just use it for people with tiny 
hands.

50
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,420
Oh yeah,
that's right.

51
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,640
Yeah.
The if you double tap the home button,

52
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:06,900
right.
This stuff,

53
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:10,170
that stuff they made for people that 
just aren't.

54
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,930
They don't fit like the standard and you
just,

55
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:16,080
you just use them and then fucking 
buzzfeed calls it life hacks.

56
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,630
Then like 10 things you didn't know,
like let's go,

57
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,680
let's get 7 million people's office.
Some basic shit there.

58
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,770
There was that one phone that they had.
I guess it was the iphone four that had 

59
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,310
the sharper edges on the side.
It was very narrow.

60
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,740
That's the perfect size phone for 
texting.

61
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,700
You think so?
Yeah.

62
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,440
It just fits in your hand.
Perfect.

63
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:39,441
Like it locks in place.
Like I can text with one hand with this 

64
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:39,441
thing,
but

65
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,810
not that easy.
It's a little slippery.

66
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:44,130
You just got to switch to get like that 
swipey keyboard.

67
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,220
Oh No,
no,

68
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,000
no,
no.

69
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,710
I've seen people do that.
Bryan county that did it makes you 

70
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:51,710
angry?
No,

71
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,901
it doesn't make me angry,
but my friend Brian Cowen was trying to 

72
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:55,410
show me how good it was.
Like,

73
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:55,760
look,
look,

74
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:56,410
look,
I right.

75
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,160
I just go from here to here and he 
fucked it up a few times.

76
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,060
I'm like,
go fuck off.

77
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,340
Just to just from this five minutes of 
before and after.

78
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:08,341
It's like I hate swipey keyboards and 
movies where kids have cancer to things 

79
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:11,100
I won't stand for.
They're pulling on your heartstrings and

80
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:13,750
if they show you cancer and a kid has 
cancer,

81
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:14,590
like right away,
like,

82
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:19,591
look,
you could have made me sad in a less 

83
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:19,591
brutal way.
So are you okay?

84
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,680
If in the trailer they let you know the 
kid has cancer,

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
fucking stupid.

86
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,820
I see what they're doing.
It's like kid out of here and you were 

87
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,290
talking about arrival.
I didn't even watch the movie.

88
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,930
I watched the movie for three minutes,
the girl had cancer and I'm like,

89
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,490
fuck you,
and I hung it up.

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,720
I'm going to sleep.
I'm not going to watch this.

91
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:40,390
He's going to want to go on this 
depressing journey right before bed.

92
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,980
It's going to get me fucked up.
Dreams,

93
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,490
so uninterested in depressing movies.
I know.

94
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,120
I've read the news.
I watch television.

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,650
I pay attention to internet videos from 
all over the world of depressing shit.

96
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,570
I know it's real.
I think the moment I had my first kid,

97
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,100
I was like,
okay,

98
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:02,620
this is.
This is my realization that at any point

99
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,050
I could have the most damaging pain in 
the world,

100
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,170
so I get that I don't need.
I don't need to be depressed and 

101
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,170
reminded of that at every moment.
[inaudible].

102
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,770
That's what I'm constantly thinking 
about when I'm not having a happy 

103
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:13,770
moment.
I'm like,

104
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,471
how?
How could the world completely fuck up 

105
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:16,471
my whole being?
Yeah.

106
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:20,820
I'm more interested in funny things 
these days or really stupid horror 

107
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,801
movies.
Is that just escapism from the insanity 

108
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:25,801
that we're dealing with?
Yeah,

109
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:27,250
that's all it is.
It's all escapism.

110
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,970
I mean,
even game of thrones or House of cards,

111
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,720
which is like about politics.
So total escapism.

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,610
These are not real people.
Yeah.

113
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:41,611
But I,
that's what I ended up finding is I end 

114
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:41,611
up rooting for people that normally 
wouldn't root for it.

115
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:41,740
Right.
So in house of cards,

116
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,530
I'm totally rooting for them and 
breaking bad.

117
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,260
Even the final season when he's doing 
all that fucked up stuff,

118
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:47,740
I'm like,
yeah,

119
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:48,910
well too white.
I'm with you man.

120
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,420
I didn't watch the final season.
I didn't get that far.

121
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,900
But uh,
I'm in the middle of a season three 

122
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:02,230
right now of house of cards and yeah,
Kevin Spacey's goddamned murderer.

123
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,230
I'm trying to remember if third,
if the third season is kind of like the 

124
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,010
man season before,
because last season the last season was 

125
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,931
amazing.
What is it like how they have five out 

126
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:15,540
for is for?
So three I think was kind of just felt 

127
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:15,540
like a setup season.
I'm and through them,

128
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,660
man.
I'm fucking cooking through them.

129
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,150
Watching a four or five a week.
Yeah.

130
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:19,630
I mean,
if you,

131
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,540
if you haven't started that episode one 
of season two,

132
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,650
that's where I was like,
okay,

133
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,850
I'm in this is because I feel like you 
always have to have that one episode 

134
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,850
where you don't know what's gonna happen
where you're like,

135
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,820
okay,
I'm on,

136
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,850
I'm on fucking shaky ground.
This isn't something that I'm going to 

137
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,791
watch while I'm cooking dinner and not 
really paying attention and not miss 

138
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:38,791
anything out.
Right.

139
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:38,791
That's like,
that's like scandal.

140
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:38,830
You're like,
okay,

141
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:43,831
they're going to go on some like fucking
eight minute monologue where it's like 

142
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:43,831
you can't do blah,
blah blah,

143
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:43,900
blah,
blah.

144
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,190
And then he was like,
what happened?

145
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,640
Okay,
yeah,

146
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:45,940
yeah,
yeah.

147
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,680
Whatever bullshit.
Well,

148
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,160
escapism is.
I mean it's fun.

149
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,650
It's.
But after awhile you just run it.

150
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,250
It runs its course.
I think just absorbing media,

151
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,040
just taking

152
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,040
in too much.
After a while you just get extremely 

153
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,040
jaded.
You know,

154
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,010
like I've seen people that are tweeting 
about things online and you go,

155
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,650
God,
that guy's fucking jaded man.

156
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,670
Like people are so jaded.
And they realized like the amount of 

157
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,720
information,
the amount of data that people are 

158
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,510
getting on a daily basis,
it's just you're not designed for this.

159
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,600
Yeah,
no one's designed have unlimited options

160
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:25,280
for entertainment viewing at your 
disposal on demand all the time.

161
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,630
If you ever want to like a quick 
reminder of how add and how true that 

162
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,501
is.
Just look at your fucking not you 

163
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:34,501
specifically,
but your own twitter history.

164
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,040
I'll go from talking about something 
like that.

165
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Deeply political and I'm like this 
fucking craziness to like did you see 

166
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,221
tonight's episode?
And there's like a difference of five 

167
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:44,221
minutes.
Exactly.

168
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:44,430
Everything's always

169
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,770
happening and I just,
I don't get it.

170
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm critical of it,
but

171
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,580
I'm part of it,
you know,

172
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,450
well we're,
we're,

173
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:56,451
we're definitely changing in our 
attention span is changing and probably 

174
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,990
not for the better.
And we're,

175
00:06:57,991 --> 00:07:02,991
we're,
we're accustomed to things being quick 

176
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:03,440
and rapid.
Like here's a perfect example.

177
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,380
The way you guys edit your videos.
You don't have any pauses.

178
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,500
You're not human in your video.
That is because I got like a c minus in 

179
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
public speaking.
Everybody does it.

180
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,010
Everybody on Youtube does it.
They all do that thing where they take 

181
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,540
out all the ums and pauses and they go 
from one thing to level a little bit,

182
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,240
a little bit,
a little,

183
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:21,710
a little,
a little,

184
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
a little bit because it is,
it is

185
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,830
battle of attention and battle of eyes.
But I think that I think people are 

186
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,770
seeing more and more,
especially even the youtube,

187
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,490
the Youtube Algorithm podcast,
I think that there is 100 percent always

188
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:34,410
going to be an audience for longer form 
things.

189
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,650
Uh,
my video is started out as it was even 

190
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,200
in the little intro sequence.
It started out as three to four minutes.

191
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,760
Let me talk about the world for three or
four minutes.

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,480
My videos now are 10 to 18 minutes every
day.

193
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,540
Granted a lot more is happening every 
day and they're like this,

194
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:51,600
this new new presidency and,
and stuff like that.

195
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:54,390
But there is an audience that wants 
more.

196
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,240
And so you had the vine guys,
but even,

197
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,270
I mean finds dead now.
But those guys have now launched into 

198
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,740
longer form pieces where some of it is 
three to four and then some are daily,

199
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,010
10 to 18 minute pieces,
so I think there's always going to be an

200
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,900
audience.
People are tuning in longer,

201
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,200
more than ever because the Internet was 
tuned in for for six seconds,

202
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,100
15 seconds,
one minute,

203
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:19,110
three to four,
and it's just getting longer and longer,

204
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,690
but it's not even just the longer 
longer.

205
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,810
Even if you do a three minute thing,
you're still going to edit out all those

206
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:26,450
little tiny gaps in between sentences.
Yeah.

207
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,200
What's that about?

208
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,220
It's just getting out as much.
If I didn't,

209
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,820
if I.
If I stopped cutting out my pause,

210
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,030
my video is five minutes longer.
It'd be.

211
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,560
It'd be a nightmare.
Really?

212
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

213
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,980
Because my video is I don't,
I don't script.

214
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,460
I'm not reading from everyone else or 
from something.

215
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:45,400
Someone else wrote A.
I do all my own research.

216
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,230
It's me taking all the information and 
then just going on this,

217
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,240
this word soup rambly thing for for five
minutes to make a three minute piece.

218
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,650
Do you like you take in too much data 
because you're doing all this,

219
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:03,651
you have,
you have to have to have the main 

220
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:04,980
difference between,
I think the last time I came on here,

221
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:08,570
which was about two years ago and now is
back then I was,

222
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:11,430
I was Kinda scared to share my opinion,
right?

223
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:16,431
So I would just,
I would kind of reputation of reddit 

224
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,971
stories that popped up and things that 
popped up on websites of like distinct 

225
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:19,971
happened.

226
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:21,090
Anyway,
here's the next thing that happened.

227
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:26,091
So you're more of an aggregator of 
things that have happened like I was 

228
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:28,140
then and now it's more of because no one
trusts anything,

229
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,200
right?
Where we talk about right wing or left 

230
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,300
wing people being in their own bubbles 
and you know,

231
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,380
we go in like I know I know the truth,
but you might not because you're just 

232
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,240
sticking to the stuff that,
that,

233
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,300
that you believe in.
And then you see something from an 

234
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,300
outside source and go,
well that's bullshit.

235
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,310
That's not buzzfeed.
Right.

236
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,320
Well and,
and that's,

237
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,160
and that's the problem.
I mean,

238
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,750
buzzfeed really,
in my opinion,

239
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:51,840
fuck themselves with the way that they 
released those documents.

240
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,260
I couldn't be completely confirmed right
with the whole,

241
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,800
like trump and the,
uh,

242
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,560
the prostitutes peeing on the bed stuff 
and they're like,

243
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:03,561
we can't,
we can't confirm it and neither can any 

244
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,010
of the other places that have gotten 
this information can't confirm it.

245
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,310
But there is this piece of paper that 
says that it may have happened.

246
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,400
What's even worse is all of these 
mainstream news sources.

247
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,890
We're doing it.
We're all releasing this story,

248
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:18,891
the salacious details on the story of 
Donald Trump and the Russian 

249
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:20,100
prostitutes,
water sports.

250
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,530
Like,
what the Fuck Outta here.

251
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,680
Just a way it read.
I immediately called bullshit.

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm like,
do you really think that he has people 

253
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,111
pee on him?
People pee on the bed and he wants them 

254
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:33,660
to pee on the bed and he watches like,
fuck off.

255
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,920
So that's the problem,
right?

256
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:38,190
Is that's not even the actual thing that
the story was,

257
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,840
but that's what it turned into the whole
story.

258
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,280
And ended up being.
Or like we're supposed to be that Barack

259
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,020
Obama and Michelle Obama stayed in a 
hotel room.

260
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,310
Right.
He hated them so much that he hired to 

261
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:51,310
come and pee on the bed,
not on him.

262
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:51,980
Right.
And so that.

263
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,700
But yeah,
but then everyone made it like,

264
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,140
Oh,
he likes pee on his face.

265
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:57,690
And it was like.
And it became this example of,

266
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,060
as long as it's hilarious enough,
I forget who said it,

267
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,460
as long as it's hilarious and enough 
people will just roll with it.

268
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,460
But it's so hack.
It's not even hilarious.

269
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,560
And it's like,
that's like what a hack premise writer 

270
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,040
would write.
Like if you want to write a hack story,

271
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,380
a hack scene in a movie,
but a crazy person.

272
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,530
He hires all these ogres baby.
Come on,

273
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,310
pee on Daddy.
You know,

274
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,770
it's like,
it's so stupid.

275
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:24,771
I feel like if you,
if you heard that though and you were 

276
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:24,771
like,
oh,

277
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:24,771
it's like a coke fueled businessman from
the eighties.

278
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:24,771
He be like,
yeah,

279
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:26,880
that probably happened,
but not in today's world.

280
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,540
Well,
not only that,

281
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,770
you don't think Donald Trump would check
his hotel room for cameras.

282
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,250
Oh really?
Do you don't think that a 

283
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,530
multibillionaire who's kind of a freak 
would go into that thing and have 

284
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,630
someone scrubbed the room and may have 
some expert?

285
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,580
Yeah,
man,

286
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,800
he's probably super paranoid.
He's fucked over so many people.

287
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,810
Maybe that's why we don't see the tax 
returns.

288
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:50,900
He's paying all these people off.
Exactly.

289
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,620
The tax return thing is real.
Does that bother you?

290
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:56,260
So yes,
I know that bothers a lot of people.

291
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:56,950
Well,
it should.

292
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:57,850
I think,
you know what?

293
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,570
I think it's,
it's,

294
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,460
it's easy to argue that,
you know,

295
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
well,
people aren't going to be able to 

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,321
understand it,
but I also know so where people are 

297
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:07,321
going to go,
well it's going to be misconstrued,

298
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:07,820
but it's,
it's,

299
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,510
it's a,
it's a,

300
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:10,240
it's an honest question.
You heard that argument?

301
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,590
Yes.
That's going to be.

302
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,630
Taxes are going to be misconstrued.

303
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,080
Yeah.
They're gonna.

304
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,610
They're gonna take the smallest things 
and they're going to on TV and the media

305
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,170
does at times and they're gonna.
They're gonna.

306
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,210
Expand on it and make it this crazy 
thing.

307
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,000
The same example with the urination 
story.

308
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,510
All of a sudden I looked at facebook,
all my real story,

309
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,300
right?
But it started out as a core thing.

310
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,880
Right?
But he plays for this and then it turned

311
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:36,670
into Donald trump likes getting peed on.
I understand what you're saying,

312
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,980
but the problem is the taxes are an 
actual real thing.

313
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,810
100 tax returns.
It's very clear and concise,

314
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,630
right?
I mean,

315
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,140
so they're going to say,
well look at this money.

316
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,870
It could have been all these things and 
then it's not.

317
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,250
It could be.
It is,

318
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,360
right?
That's an argument.

319
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:54,361
It's not one that I agree with,
but I would prefer to actually see 

320
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:56,800
because I am a big fan of like get as 
much information out as possible so that

321
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:57,970
we can actually break shit down.

322
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,310
Well,
every single president has done it,

323
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,830
right.
That's what's so unprecedented about it.

324
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,860
And he has multiple business ties 
apparently with Russia and he owes a 

325
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:13,321
shitload of money to China.
Like those things are massive factors 

326
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:16,981
and he has these business ventures that 
he has an all these countries all over 

327
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:19,210
the world.
What's really crazy is his son's running

328
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,390
his business now.
Right?

329
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,420
So his sons are getting flown around 
with secret service details all on the 

330
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,731
country's dime.
He spending more money on travel in 

331
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:31,120
seven months and Obama did in eight 
years.

332
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,350
That's the projection.
If things go really?

333
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,110
Yes.
Okay.

334
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,170
I'd have to.
I'd have to look at the numbers so you 

335
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:40,170
can find it,
Jamie,

336
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:40,630
because that's for me,
that's like New York Times.

337
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,580
I'm pretty sure because that's.
For me,

338
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:47,581
that's,
that's the whole premise of my show now 

339
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:47,620
is you're making that argument of why we
should.

340
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,320
I then on my show mentioned that 
argument.

341
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,560
I then go into the argument of how it 
could be misconstrued and then I 

342
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,770
separately give my opinion,
which I personally believe that we 

343
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:57,880
should get the tax,
but it's not even an opinion thing.

344
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,840
It's law.
He supposed to release his tax returns.

345
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,380
That's what your supposed to do,
but don't you remember there's the whole

346
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:09,910
audit audit which will go on to the end 
of time and none of it makes any sense.

347
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:11,670
I mean how long does the audit last 
year?

348
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,270
Who's auditing it?
Right.

349
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,330
And then the hard thing is the story.
There's like eight stories every day.

350
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Um,
I feel like because I haven't seen 

351
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Kellyanne Conway on TV as much lately,
it's,

352
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,190
it's less of the case and there was 
even,

353
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:26,020
it felt like two days were Donald Trump 
didn't tweet,

354
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,560
which was unprecedented.
Uh,

355
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,600
but it's,
it's overloading your [inaudible] there.

356
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,030
There are a lot of people that will ask 
me why didn't you cover a certain story?

357
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:39,031
And it's just,
I am one guy making at that time a 16 

358
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:39,490
minute show that I'm trying to explain 
things properly.

359
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:42,490
So how am I going to,
how am I going to get a point?

360
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,200
Get across all the points?
Yeah.

361
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:49,201
Look at this in Forbes,
trump's family cost his trips to costco 

362
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:52,280
taxpayers nearly as much in a month as 
Obama's in a whole year.

363
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,580
Yeah,
it's,

364
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,710
it's the whole thing is very bizarre.
And what's really crazy is he was very 

365
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,750
critical of Obama President Barack 
Obama's vacation.

366
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:04,160
It's costing tax payers millions of 
dollars.

367
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,290
Unbelievable.
What about you?

368
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,330
Hey man,
but he's going to be.

369
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,090
You have to think about the net.
You're going to save all that money from

370
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:13,310
all the fewer regulations.
Right?

371
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Something,
something we're not saving any money 

372
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:18,700
from,
fewer regulations,

373
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,360
we're going to have to clean all those 
ducks that get covered in oil.

374
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,680
The whole thing is so fucked,
fucked.

375
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,630
It's hard.
I mean,

376
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:31,631
but even like you're throwing out your 
opinions now and I think that it's 

377
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,501
important to have those people,
but I think it's also then important to 

378
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,600
take the time to look into where the Fox
News,

379
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,060
the Breitbarts,
the Donald,

380
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:43,061
the,
all those places where they're coming 

381
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:43,061
from as far as where their opinions come
from because I don't think so.

382
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:44,480
Salon.com.
Rolfing didn't post.

383
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:49,481
I mean we've got to echo chambers on the
left and on the right and it's the sound

384
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:54,941
of the both of them is definitely to the
point where you can't make out what the 

385
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:54,941
fuck is going on.
Right.

386
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:59,141
And I think that's why it's important to
look at both so you can kind of fucking 

387
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:00,770
like Shimmy it through a filter and see 
where these sources are coming from.

388
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,570
Gold looking for gold man.

389
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,910
Looking for the fucking truth.
Because who knows what the fuck it is.

390
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,970
It doesn't,
it doesn't.

391
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,510
It doesn't exist for people,
right?

392
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:10,210
It's reality.
I mean,

393
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,350
it's been a conversation of like reality
doesn't matter,

394
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,370
right?
It's all about perception.

395
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:16,340
That is,
that is more true than ever today,

396
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,820
right?
Because people believe people believe in

397
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,870
their right or left wing thing like they
believe in God,

398
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,620
right?
It's,

399
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:27,710
it's,
it's not just a fact to them,

400
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:31,250
it's not just opinion,
it is ingrained belief and it's.

401
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:36,330
And it's just me trying not to close the
door on anyone so that I can always try 

402
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:36,950
and have someone's ear.
Right.

403
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:39,740
So people can think that.
What do you mean by that?

404
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,450
So depending on the video.
Right.

405
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:44,780
So yesterday I talked about it 
personally,

406
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:45,530
is that you're saying,
okay,

407
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:45,950
yes,
yes.

408
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:47,950
So yesterday I talked about,
uh,

409
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,210
the police officer or the off duty cop 
and Anaheim.

410
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,870
Oh,
I saw that.

411
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:52,070
I was crazy.
It was crazy.

412
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:57,130
And my whole thing was playing it for 
people that don't know what we're 

413
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,130
talking about.
Okay.

414
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,120
So there's some stuff that we don't see.
There's two arguments.

415
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,920
Uh,
there is one that,

416
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,680
uh,
the off duty cop will,

417
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:07,681
we'll go through his story first.
He said that these kids were walking on 

418
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:07,681
his,
uh,

419
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,590
his property walk through his property.
Maybe they're cutting through.

420
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,320
Um,
he said something to the girl.

421
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,780
The boy says that you called her a 
contract.

422
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,040
I said,
that's not appropriate.

423
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,020
Um,
and he says,

424
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,180
uh,
the child's didn't say that.

425
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:23,000
He said that he was willing to shoot the
off duty cop.

426
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,020
He said,
I'm going to shoot you.

427
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,970
The boy says no.
I said,

428
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:30,971
I'm going to sue you,
but the cop says he's going to detain 

429
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:33,881
the kid until the police arrive because 
you threatened an off duty police 

430
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:33,881
officer.

431
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:35,600
Right?
That then turns into this.

432
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,960
This kid he like pushes the police 
officer,

433
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,350
another kid,
a different cable.

434
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,230
So that happens at first.
Uh,

435
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,090
the kid that's being detained pushes the
police.

436
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,830
Uh,
the off duty cop into a bush.

437
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,090
Then two minutes past,
uh,

438
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,450
they slowly get closer to this hedge.
Um,

439
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:55,451
another,
another kid puts hands on the off duty 

440
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:55,451
cop,
another kid.

441
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:57,240
Then shoulder checks the cop over the 
hedge.

442
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,640
Then the kid who originally did that 
touch them.

443
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,690
God,
it'd be so much easier to have the 

444
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:05,690
video.
Then one of the other kids who would put

445
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:05,690
hands on him,
punched the cop,

446
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,790
another kid jumped over the hedge and 
they kind of surrounded him.

447
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,310
And at that point,
uh,

448
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,460
the cop pulled out a gun,
um,

449
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,510
and everyone kind of ran away and then 
it looks like the cops trying to pull 

450
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,480
the kid over the hedge while holding the
gun,

451
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,890
it goes off.

452
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,770
And then two kids arrested.
He's not right.

453
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:27,771
And it's a crazy video.
And so we're talking about a story like 

454
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:30,681
that that,
that becomes a little different than 

455
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,631
just talking about politics because it's
seeing something not knowing fully how 

456
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:33,150
it started.
Right?

457
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:38,151
So you're having to take the word of to 
people without having the evidence and 

458
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,450
trying to get across the point.
My pain,

459
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,490
my main points in the video,
um,

460
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,760
I don't like that.
The cop didn't seem to deescalate the 

461
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,190
situation,
didn't continually announced that he was

462
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:52,191
a police officer,
didn't announce that he was denouncing 

463
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:52,500
it at all.
So there's this point in the video where

464
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,190
a kid I believe says,
I don't believe you're a cop or how do I

465
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:57,510
know you're a cop or something like 
that.

466
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,070
Um,
there's two different videos,

467
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,370
so it seems like maybe he announced it,
but if I was him,

468
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,900
right,
this is hindsight,

469
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,320
of course I'd be constantly announcing 
that I am an off duty police officer and

470
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:12,321
I'm detaining this kid until the police 
show up rather than potentially just 

471
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:15,090
some stranger grabbing a child and also,
um,

472
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,740
I don't agree.
Or I,

473
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:19,560
if I was in his position and all of a 
sudden I started being attacked,

474
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,270
I would 100 percent have pulled the gun 
out,

475
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:23,520
but I wouldn't have fired it because 
they were already running away.

476
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,540
And I think that is

477
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,010
attacking him because the way he was 
handling the situation.

478
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,900
Totally.
And that's,

479
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,180
that's a hard thing of I have my 
personal opinion in these segmented 

480
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,501
areas.
I think he could have done way more to 

481
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:37,501
deescalate the situation.
Um,

482
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:41,011
I think that when he pulled out the gun,
he had a choice to either fix his hands 

483
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,890
so that he didn't accidentally shoot a 
gun around children.

484
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,250
Why does he have a round chambered?
Right?

485
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,430
Why is the safety not on?
Those are important questions,

486
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,360
right?
So you have to,

487
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:54,400
especially someone that has a concealed 
weapon,

488
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,790
someone that's an off duty cop,
you have to hold them to a higher 

489
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,071
standard.
My argument there though is if I was in 

490
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,861
that same position,
I would have 100 percent as I was being 

491
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:04,861
attacked,
especially if I have a weapon on me that

492
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:08,911
all of a sudden I'm going to get worried
that maybe it could be used against me 

493
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:09,580
as these kids are already attacked me.
I would pull it out,

494
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:11,540
but then he takes it to a different 
right level

495
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,600
where even the way he pulled it out,
he pulled it out slow and sloppy,

496
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,640
right?
Like if I saw someone reaching under 

497
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:19,700
their shirt like that for a gun,
if I was a crazy person,

498
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:23,420
I would totally attacked him,
tackle them 100 percent.

499
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,260
If they don't get ahold of that gun,
then they're not armed.

500
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,510
As soon as they get ahold of that gun,
there aren't.

501
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,200
Right.
I mean,

502
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:33,770
if he's doing all this jazz and reaching
in and it's taken so much time,

503
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,010
that's all the time you can punch him in
the face like this.

504
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,230
He's not going to stop you from punching
in.

505
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:42,560
The face of it is reaching and grabbing 
his guns slow and sloppy.

506
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,560
It took a long time because he was doing
it with one hand,

507
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,560
lifting up his shirt was trying to get 
the gun.

508
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:47,700
Yeah.

509
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,860
I think he was posturing a lot of ways 
to like letting the.

510
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:51,940
Oh Yeah,
oh yeah,

511
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,460
look at this.
Look at ditch dare has been garden.

512
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,670
Now what the the press conference 
afterwards.

513
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,170
It feels very much like they're.
They're getting their,

514
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:03,340
their ducks in a row before they really 
come down on them of course,

515
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:07,510
but a cop is just a person so there's 
going to be great cops and there's going

516
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:12,511
to be morons and there's going to be 
people that just didn't realize the 

517
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:16,831
situation was going to get to where it 
got to and they just didn't handle all 

518
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:18,370
the steps along the way and that's 
probably what happened with him.

519
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:19,660
He probably thought he was going to say,
Hey,

520
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,790
stop coming through my lawn and making 
noise.

521
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,350
You will fucks,
you know,

522
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,330
and the kids like,
fuck you,

523
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:25,420
I'll shoot you.
And he's like,

524
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,110
Oh really?

525
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,720
Motherfuck Aroma Cup,
you don't believe me?

526
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,040
God dammit,
look at this.

527
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,850
This is my fucking.
But so like talking about that story,

528
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:38,851
it's trying to take in both sides of the
argument and then separately giving my 

529
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:41,080
opinion and I did an event last night 
and a kid said,

530
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:41,740
you know,
what do you,

531
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,600
what do you say to people that disagree 
with you there?

532
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,160
Especially from the Latino community,
right?

533
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Where things like how a cop is going to 
treat me is going to be different than 

534
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,490
how they treat us,
and I said,

535
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:53,860
I think it's 100 percent fine for you to
have a disagreement.

536
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,330
Tell me.
Talk to me.

537
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,670
Don't,
don't look at my opinion and go,

538
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,400
this is a fucking asshole.
I hate this fucking guy.

539
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,970
Michael trade talks about in the special
where he had he went through like a 

540
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:05,970
weird thing to try and educate me.

541
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,370
Give me your point of view and that's 
why it's okay for people to go like he.

542
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,030
He tried to give both both sides.
He gave his opinion.

543
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,230
Who?
Who is he though?

544
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,550
Were you saying?
Just people.

545
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,740
People out.
People that watch my show,

546
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,650
right?
Because I have far left far right.

547
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:22,360
People that watch,
they don't always agree,

548
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,510
but they know that I'm always going into
it with the best of intentions and I'm 

549
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,530
not going to hide facts and I'm not 
gonna Hide my opinion and I think that's

550
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:30,550
important.
Yeah.

551
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:32,110
Well,
when you're seeing a video like that,

552
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:34,950
you're not seeing what had transpired 
before.

553
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:36,790
It got to the point where he's holding 
onto that kid.

554
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,770
Right?
So who knows who was a dick.

555
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,160
He didn't handle it well,
but you don't expect the kids to him 

556
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,540
well because your fucking kids.
No kid handles anything.

557
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,780
Well,
what name me a 10 year old kid who deals

558
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,590
with things.
Well,

559
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,890
you know,
they didn't.

560
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,030
They're just trying things out there,
experimenting.

561
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,130
They really don't know how to 
communicate properly.

562
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:00,070
I think the number one thing people in 
their 20 to says I was such a stupid kid

563
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:05,071
and then then,
then you go to the thirties and I was 

564
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:05,071
uh,
when I was 20,

565
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:05,071
I was such a fucking idiot.
Yeah.

566
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:06,010
And it just keeps going.
You hope that you're growing.

567
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Yeah.
When I was 30 I was retarded GRANDPA.

568
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:12,590
No,
I'm telling you.

569
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,500
Didn't you see that Salon Dot com 
article?

570
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:16,480
You can say that.
You can definitely still say it.

571
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,760
I remember we talked about that last 
time I called.

572
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,360
I didn't,
I didn't,

573
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:21,010
I didn't,
I didn't try and take back that word.

574
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,770
I just want to be able to say I just 
wanna be able to say kill yourself.

575
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,720
Just get you definitely saw that.
Yeah,

576
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,430
and because we say,
well,

577
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:28,480
what about mental health?
And I'm like,

578
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,630
I'm not talking about it in that avenue.
I'm just saying that guy that cut me 

579
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:33,630
off,
you should kill himself.

580
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,100
Dictating should kill himself.
Oh,

581
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,400
set it.
There you go.

582
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,390
That's it.
That's the only clip they're going to 

583
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,390
use from this entire podcast.
Dick Cheney should kill himself.

584
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,000
There's a few people that just like,
man,

585
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,500
come on.
What have you done?

586
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,150
What have you done?
What have you done?

587
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,370
That's ridiculous.
Some monsters out there for sure.

588
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,560
Just jump off bridges.
Wait,

589
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:51,980
what?
Oh,

590
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:56,981
that should jump off.
Then you think there's too many people 

591
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:57,770
I'm sure.
And child molesters.

592
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,980
Jump off the bridge.
There's a lot of priests out there that 

593
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:02,980
could definitely run into traffic,
but don't.

594
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,250
Don't do that because you fuck up 
somebody's car.

595
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,170
Oh my God.
Jump off the bridge.

596
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,120
Right?
Not the worst thing to say,

597
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,020
look,
just this.

598
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,070
This game didn't go so well.
Just pull the plug on the console and 

599
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,380
replug this pitch in and see what 
happens is.

600
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:18,650
Then you drive it.
Flip the board.

601
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,480
Just it's over.
The game's over.

602
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,820
Knock the chess pieces down.
Just walk away.

603
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,700
There's definitely too many taboo words 
today,

604
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:33,701
that's for sure.
I've been talking about this in my act 

605
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:34,670
quite a bit lately because it's just,
where's this supposed to convey tent?

606
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,730
They're not.
They're not supposed to be magic taboo 

607
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,641
words and half of it is not even about 
trying to get people to be more 

608
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:48,431
considerate or more kind.
It's about calling people out on doing 

609
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:52,481
something wrong and stopping them.
Do you think the intent matters more 

610
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:56,111
than the word hundred percent?
Because I feel like we saw that a lot 

611
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:56,360
with um,
there's a,

612
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,800
there's two big youtubers that were in 
the,

613
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,810
it was a or one was in the news,
there was a cutie pie.

614
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Talk about that because I saw his 
response video and I kinda got sickened.

615
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,930
Oh really?
By what's happening to him.

616
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,130
Oh,
by what's happening.

617
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:11,790
I thought you were saying you know his 
words.

618
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,560
Well,
he was,

619
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,030
he was crazy.
It was crazy.

620
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,090
The whole thing's insane.
They're making it out like he's a Nazi 

621
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,100
and he's not at all.
No.

622
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:25,430
He had made some,
some videos where he had told people to 

623
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:30,731
not be Nazis and not until like to too.
Don't you know,

624
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,940
what was his exact words?
I don't,

625
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:37,941
I don't want them to this ripping.
It originally started with this whole 

626
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:38,320
fiverr video that he did.
Um,

627
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,190
and then fiverr.
Yeah.

628
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:43,850
So it's like a website where you can get
people to do thing for things originally

629
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:47,870
for $5 now for more money.
And so he went through the site.

630
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:49,940
It all started from this one video that 
got him attention.

631
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,970
He went to fiverr and try to get people 
to do ridiculous,

632
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:54,270
outrageous things.
Okay.

633
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,410
Good guy dressed as Jesus to say 
something weird.

634
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,060
He got these,
uh,

635
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,310
the main thing that blew up were these 
two guys,

636
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,680
they're like,
they're in like a jungle setting of some

637
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:04,100
sort.

638
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,270
They dance,
they laugh,

639
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:06,920
they'll hold up a sign,
they'll say something.

640
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,220
And so he was like,
it's going to be hilarious because 

641
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,220
they're not going to do it right.
They're going to be like,

642
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,920
thank you.
But no.

643
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,550
But they actually made a video where the
guys were laughing and dancing,

644
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:21,610
held up a sign that said a death to all 
Jews and then said to subscribe to a 

645
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:22,970
youtube channel.
Right.

646
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:23,990
The whole of,
uh,

647
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,260
of,
uh,

648
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,560
of someone else asked them to say death 
to all Jews.

649
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,680
So he,
he wrote in as like a cause in the same 

650
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,050
video.
He gets all these people that are like,

651
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,600
I'm not going to do the stupid 
ridiculous thing that you said.

652
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,740
But then they actually did it.
The big reason I feel like they did it 

653
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,421
as they didn't understand what the words
they were writing in the words that 

654
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:43,421
we're saying,
oh,

655
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:44,250
they're from another country.
What country

656
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,360
were they from?
I don't know.

657
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,740
I'd have to,
I'd have to double check.

658
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,770
Okay.
So they just essentially wrote down the 

659
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,511
symbols.
They didn't really know how to even say 

660
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:53,511
the word.
And so there it is.

661
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:53,511
So there it is.
Oh yeah.

662
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,060
And they're laughing.

663
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,520
And so I think this might be from his 
explanation video,

664
00:26:56,521 --> 00:27:00,090
but in the first one he's like,
why the fuck did they do it?

665
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,740
How do I,
can I even include this?

666
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,250
And so then that sent,
that,

667
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:10,251
got that,
got a little traction and then people 

668
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:10,251
started going through his other videos 
and they're like,

669
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:10,590
he's,
he's dressed up,

670
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:15,890
he's watching Hitler in this one taken 
completely out of context of him saying 

671
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,551
that the Youtube Heroes Program,
which was a program where people can 

672
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,980
highlight videos,
are not highlight them but mark them 

673
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:24,980
down for deletion because they're 
offensive.

674
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,770
Right?
And so people were like,

675
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:30,771
oh,
that censorship that's you're talking 

676
00:27:30,771 --> 00:27:30,900
about like obviously hyperbole.
It's like those are Nazis.

677
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,190
So he made that joke in that relation.
And then there was one,

678
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:37,890
if I want to say if it was on the verge 
or wired,

679
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,270
but then they go even further and 
they're like,

680
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:44,271
he was Leslie Jones.
Picture on Harambie taken completely out

681
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:48,030
of context because he was using,
there was this Microsoft Ai Bot,

682
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,860
this chat Bot,
and you'd say,

683
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:52,560
uh,
let me see Harambie as Jesus.

684
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,770
And uh,
either the AI was messed up or people 

685
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,830
had manipulated it where it was putting 
Leslie Jones his face on it.

686
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,020
And he was horrified by it.
And that was a whole joke,

687
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,820
but they were saying that he,
he was doing it.

688
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,660
So this is clear,
like he,

689
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:07,360
you saw him use the software and saw the
error.

690
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,540
You try and use the bot today.
A picture won't come up because now they

691
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:11,920
are aware that that's what was 
happening.

692
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,230
Right.
And so they took all these things and it

693
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:16,420
was this like this crusade of,
look guys,

694
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:18,640
we're looking at this bad guy.
He's the biggest guy on youtube,

695
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:20,530
he's the bad guy.
We're going to take them down.

696
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,680
So much taken out of context.
Some things are not defensible where I 

697
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,511
can't,
I can't say it in the sense of like you 

698
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:30,511
say that words don't have power based on
intent.

699
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:31,510
And I think there's a,
there's a lot of truth in that.

700
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,630
Not saying words don't have power based 
on intent.

701
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,030
I'm saying that words should just convey
intent.

702
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,310
Right?
And there are times where a word,

703
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,820
there's times where like you see a 
friend,

704
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,810
Nico,
what's up bitch,

705
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,860
and you know,
you in there and you're both laughing 

706
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,481
and being silly.
And then there's times where you call 

707
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:52,880
someone a bitch because you think 
they're being mean.

708
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,610
Yeah,
I mean those two words exactly the same.

709
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,740
But one conveys a completely different 
intent.

710
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,420
Right.
But out of this it was,

711
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,430
it was very obvious that they were 
trying to do this takedown thing and it 

712
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,430
blew up entirely in their face I think

713
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,450
because I don't think most people are 
aware.

714
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,210
I mean there was a Wall Street Journal 
article.

715
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,220
All right.
Which was where it got really weird 

716
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,561
because three people worked on this and 
they combed through hundreds of hours 

717
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:21,410
and they found like instances of him 
holding his arm out like this.

718
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:23,870
And they used that picture.
Like there's A.

719
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,750
I mean that's,
that's weird.

720
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,360
Very weird.
And then,

721
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:30,520
and then once all that came out that 
they were like,

722
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,640
well,
here's the thing about the context.

723
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,470
He's just like Donald Trump.
And it was,

724
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,950
it was an immediate jump to.
He's using the same tactic tactics as 

725
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,740
Donald Trump,
but it was just insane.

726
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:41,980
Now

727
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,980
he's very reasonable.
He did a video response video about it 

728
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,590
and the way he handled it was very 
reasonable.

729
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,830
And he explained what he was doing and 
what's going on and you know,

730
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:55,831
he's doing hundreds of hours of him 
playing video games and talking and 

731
00:29:55,831 --> 00:30:00,160
being silly and if you comb through 
those and take these things again out of

732
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:03,730
context and try to make it look like 
he's a Nazi,

733
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:05,440
that's a hit piece.
One hundred percent.

734
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:09,160
And it's deceptive.
It's not indicative of his overall.

735
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,890
It's hard to call it a body of work,
but let's call it a body of work,

736
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,960
right?
His overall body of performance that's 

737
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:16,960
online,
whatever you want to call it,

738
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,860
right?
His talking,

739
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:22,861
it's not who he is.
So for them to call him a Nazi and say 

740
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:26,410
that pooty pie has seven videos where 
he's done something about Nazis,

741
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:30,790
like people when they're doing these 
long form spit ball,

742
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,040
improvisation,
videos like that,

743
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:38,041
and you're interacting with people,
you're going to say all kinds of shit 

744
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:41,760
that in the moment is legitimate.
But if you chop it up and edit it and 

745
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,160
splice them all together and then make a
five minute montage of him saying Nazi,

746
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,380
like he's obsessed with Nazis

747
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,850
and what,
what kind of sucked from it was a lot of

748
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:51,810
people think that,
oh,

749
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,220
they're there articles about the 
downfall of Pewdiepie.

750
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:00,050
I think he's gone up half a million if 
not more than a million subscribers 

751
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,050
since all of this happened.
Right.

752
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,710
So he's gotten all this new support.
He's a temporary phase for a,

753
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,730
for free speech,
free speech and persecution for 

754
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:07,730
mainstream media.
Didn't even lose some,

755
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,040
some get matter for him though.
He.

756
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,640
So,
I mean,

757
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,700
it sucks more for the people that we're 
working on that project.

758
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,940
What was the project?
So it was scare Pewdie pie season two.

759
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:16,800
It was a youtube red series.
Um,

760
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,830
so they were,
I think there were about to go into 

761
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,830
production.
Um,

762
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,830
and,
and so then that got canceled.

763
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,840
So Youtube didn't want to fund that.
And I said it,

764
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,990
he said it.
He understands why they would have to 

765
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,731
separate because then it becomes a story
of youtube and or Youtube and Disney 

766
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:32,380
support an anti Semite.
Right,

767
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:32,660
but that's.

768
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,070
He's not an anti Semite,
so why would they back away?

769
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,520
I think because they were scared that 
the Wall Street Journal was like,

770
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,310
did you see all of this?
We're going to write this article,

771
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,740
Wall Street Journal at that slip 
through.

772
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,230
That seems to me very response.

773
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,620
Many of them are standing by it though.
Many people,

774
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,940
yes.
One hundred percent and many are touting

775
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:55,200
it as this victory because he lost a 
google preferred ads on Youtube,

776
00:31:55,201 --> 00:32:00,201
which I will say I don't know how he was
still seen as family friendly because 

777
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:03,921
I'm not family friendly on my show his 
past two years at the very least not 

778
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,700
family friendly and then dropped by 
maker.

779
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,650
He doesn't,
he doesn't need his.

780
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:12,651
Uh,
his MTN has his company around him and 

781
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:15,471
the youtube red series is nothing.
He's still gonna make millions of 

782
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:15,471
dollars.
He's grown.

783
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:17,270
It's a good thing.
I feel like now if you,

784
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:19,260
if you have mainstream media,
try and take a swing at you.

785
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,830
It's some of the best promotion in the 
world.

786
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Why did they take a swing at him and why
is anyone saying that they took down a 

787
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,470
bad guy?
I think

788
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,890
that it's a big thing of them trying to 
label and it's,

789
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,160
once again,
it's a problem with a lot of media is 

790
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,160
there.
They're overextending,

791
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,560
right?
They all of a sudden start talking about

792
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:40,460
this narrative about outright and the 
rise of white again in this country.

793
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,830
And then they look at this big guy and 
they're like,

794
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,120
we can use him as an example.
We can be the heroes that expose this,

795
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:49,000
that do the take down piece.
Um,

796
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,980
and they're not and they're not.
And they're like so driven for that,

797
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,780
that they then just,
they go,

798
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,340
oh,
well maybe that doesn't add up there.

799
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,140
It's an argument,
but we have the power.

800
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,380
We have the size of the audience were 
good and it just blew up in their face.

801
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,580
So they were thinking they could get 
away with it even though it wasn't 

802
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:05,580
kosher.
I believe so too.

803
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,470
What is their response so far?
Do,

804
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,910
do you know?
Have you read anything about it?

805
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:14,040
Right as far as like fans or Wall Street
Journal posts,

806
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,140
posts,
digging their heels in,

807
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:21,650
and then a lot of people started trying 
to find as always turned on like the 

808
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,180
authors in the past one was like a joke 
from 2015 because and,

809
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:27,960
and while part of me would go,
well that's petty.

810
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,940
If the argument is that context doesn't 
matter,

811
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,600
then fine then then look at these guys,
what they said a year ago,

812
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:38,601
look at what they are saying now look,
the writers who have the article like I 

813
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,740
think Ben Fritz was one of the art.
The writer is where you made A.

814
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,230
I can't,
I didn't,

815
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:45,450
I never knew that Jews were so good at 
frying joke from way back.

816
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:50,451
And then he made another joke about,
it was like a back and forth with 

817
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:52,680
someone where he said,
these racial jokes are so stupid.

818
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,420
And then someone said,
Eh,

819
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,500
you know,
they hit everyone.

820
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,130
And he said,
well,

821
00:33:56,131 --> 00:33:58,050
at least the black jokes are funny.
Those ones,

822
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,370
those ones are funny.
Um,

823
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,480
and so people were like,
well,

824
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:00,990
if,
if,

825
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,270
if context doesn't matter,
are you a scumbag?

826
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:08,810
And then people just dismissed it as are
a lot of mainstream people dismissed it 

827
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:08,810
as like,
oh,

828
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,080
that's not the same thing.

829
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,170
How could anyone say context doesn't 
matter.

830
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,900
That's insane.
That is an insane thing to say.

831
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,870
Is that literally what they said,
that context does not matter.

832
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,150
What was it?
It was one of the.

833
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:24,151
One of the people I'm going to get the 
problem is so many people have written 

834
00:34:24,151 --> 00:34:27,001
about it.
There was one article that was promoted 

835
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:29,161
and it said all these are articles or 
all these people defending Felix with,

836
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,260
but context.
That's a bullshit argument and that's 

837
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,970
insane if you think that that's.
So everything exists in a,

838
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,630
in a,
in a highly edited bubble,

839
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,430
dope,
ruined everyone's career.

840
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,310
If you're talking about a mathematician 
discussing algorithms,

841
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:47,311
yes,
context doesn't really mean that much 

842
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:47,380
because he's talking about numbers,
but we're not talking about numbers,

843
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,710
talking about words.
We're talking about the way people 

844
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,081
express themselves and we're talking 
about someone who is generally 

845
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:55,840
considered to be humorous.
I mean pooty Pie,

846
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:57,850
a lot of his stuff is playful and 
humorous,

847
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,880
so if your humerus and you're playing 
around and you say something that might 

848
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,141
be,
I don't even want to use the 

849
00:35:07,141 --> 00:35:09,061
appropriate,
it might be the thing for him to say in 

850
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:09,710
that moment to try to be entertaining.
Right.

851
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:14,850
That does not mean he's a Nazi and two 
to label him like that is incredibly 

852
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,640
irresponsible and it's.
It's really bad.

853
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,960
I mean,
I'm not a lawyer,

854
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,050
but I would sue the fuck out of him if I
was him.

855
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,230
I would sue the fuck out of them for 
sure.

856
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:31,290
Yeah.
Because what they're doing is 

857
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,350
misrepresenting who he is as a human 
being and even if it's beneficial in the

858
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:37,351
long run,
it's super dangerous to set that 

859
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:37,351
precedent.

860
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:40,530
Well,
especially in this climate where you 

861
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,101
say,
this is what he supports and it 100 

862
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:43,101
percent isn't.
How do you know someone doesn't just see

863
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,820
those articles,
doesn't see as defense and tries to kill

864
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:45,950
the guy,
but why

865
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,500
Wall Street Journal do something like 
this?

866
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Now,
this is where the conspiratorially 

867
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,301
minded start thinking,
this pooty pie kid is this youtube 

868
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:58,610
sensation,
much like this Philip Defranco guy.

869
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,170
Oh,
I mean I have 5 million subscribers.

870
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:01,610
This guy has like $53,
million,

871
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,780
whatever.
That's still a lot.

872
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,230
It's a lot.
But do you feel,

873
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,970
and you're,
you know,

874
00:36:07,971 --> 00:36:12,971
you have a legitimate viewpoint on this.
Do you feel like there is some sort of 

875
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,150
resentment or anger or.
I'm so people that are working against 

876
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:25,870
the folks that are,
have become these new media stars 

877
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:25,870
because I mean,
you essentially mean,

878
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,550
correct me if I'm wrong,
but you kind of run your own thing,

879
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:28,850
right?

880
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,330
For the most part,
I am part of a company right now.

881
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:37,331
Yeah.
That was a financial decision that you 

882
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:37,331
made along the way once you became 
successful doing it in a year.

883
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:39,820
I'll be back on my own and uh,
and we're going to get threats.

884
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,430
This is where I start the negotiations.
No,

885
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,450
and in a year because if I,
because I want to start my own larger 

886
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,971
news organization of people that are 
from the left and from the Ryan can 

887
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:52,250
debate like one of my favorite play,
a character.

888
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,170
I want to wear a fake nose and a 
mustache.

889
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,990
Just talk shit and make things up and 
lie.

890
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:59,240
I want to lie.
I want to be like a line news guy.

891
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,210
At first I thought muddied the water 
for.

892
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,870
At first I thought you were talking 
about Gavin,

893
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:04,680
but then you said the life that I was 
like,

894
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,310
man,
he's a character man.

895
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,430
I funny motherfucker because I 
originally knew him as a comedian and 

896
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,320
then I found all the new stuff with or 
maybe it's not that new,

897
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,940
but uh,
all his political stuff.

898
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,580
I like listening to the [inaudible]

899
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,610
not very new at all.
He was great the other day.

900
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,210
Was it yesterday?
How many days ago was that?

901
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:26,590
Yesterday was dominick Cruz two days 
ago.

902
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,330
I do too many podcasts.
I know.

903
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:28,990
I was like,
I was like,

904
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:31,250
how the fuck is he had on this?
Yeah.

905
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,010
Neil Tyson.
Dominic

906
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,320
cruise.
My name should not be on any list.

907
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,780
Neil degrasse Tyson.
I fucking love that.

908
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,570
Fuck is mind on.

909
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,290
It doesn't make any sense either.
He was awesome.

910
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,320
That was the Neil degrasse Tyson show.
It's basically like I threw a couple of 

911
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,990
questions,
Adam and he just went on these epic mind

912
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:51,060
bending rants in your brain.
Oh,

913
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:54,080
I turned it inside out and then just 
fucking hosed it down with bleach.

914
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,220
My brain will never be the same.
We can.

915
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,460
It was awesome.
Scotty.

916
00:37:58,461 --> 00:38:03,461
So interesting.
He's one of the most fascinating people 

917
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:06,311
I've ever talked to him because of his 
passion for things like the way he 

918
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:09,941
described space and astrophysics.
It's not just that he's so 

919
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:13,571
knowledgeable.
It's the intense passionate in which it 

920
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:13,880
delivers that information.
It's so infectious.

921
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Well,
that's what separates people is the 

922
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,450
passion relating everything to to art 
that way and the lease.

923
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,240
It's relatable to everyone.

924
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,780
Everyone will.
It really is,

925
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,270
and there's an art form to the way he 
does it.

926
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,760
I mean,
there's so many people.

927
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:31,761
I mean,
I'm sure you probably experienced at 

928
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:31,761
some point in your life,
a boring science teacher,

929
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:32,280
right?
We all have.

930
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,750
Where you just like,
oh my God,

931
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:38,751
it's so boring.
I would have thought that as an adult I 

932
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,371
would be fascinated by sirens so that 
will be constantly looking at science 

933
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:44,911
blogs and reading all these scientific 
papers and paying attention to every 

934
00:38:44,911 --> 00:38:49,670
single news release by NASA of new 
exoplanets that they've discovered.

935
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,790
Passionate makes a difference.
I was in school,

936
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,510
I was way better at math,
but I was.

937
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,520
I was fascinated with storytelling 
because I had a really passionate 

938
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,970
English teacher really,
and I sucked at it initially,

939
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:04,510
but really got me into storytelling and,
and,

940
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,550
and,
and the journey and the beauty of a 

941
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,430
story and I feel like that we need more 
people like that.

942
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,220
People that care rather than just 
chasing the dollar.

943
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,760
Which,
hey,

944
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,510
no,
no,

945
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,030
no disrespect for making money.
I,

946
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,110
I do feel like some people villainize 
that,

947
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,240
but you have to have the passion.

948
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Well for sure,
but it's the role of the school teacher 

949
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,010
is such an underappreciated and 
undervalued and also it's not just 

950
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,930
undervalued under appreciated,
but when done incorrectly,

951
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,900
it's so fucking potentially damaging.
I mean,

952
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:40,180
you could really screw a kid's head up.
I mean,

953
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:45,570
I don't know if anybody.
Did any teacher ever say mean shit to 

954
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,881
you when you were a kid that stung you 
and stayed with you for years and years 

955
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:48,610
afterwards?

956
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,100
Um.
Oh shoot.

957
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,120
Well,
I had some,

958
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,290
some rough,
uh,

959
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,640
some,
some rough,

960
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,920
a Catholic school teachers,
but that was like,

961
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,300
that was early day,
so that was elementary.

962
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:59,460
That was,
that was stuff that maybe pushed me more

963
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:04,461
away from the religion.
I think later on it was probably my 

964
00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:06,660
Spanish teacher who was just so 
disappointed.

965
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:10,650
Anytime I got anything wrong that it 
just made me scared and made me a.

966
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,380
I didn't have any enthusiasm to all of a
sudden learn a new language.

967
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,900
And so now I'm this.
I'm one of these dumb fucks.

968
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:18,780
It only knows one language me to it.
Was it a man or a woman?

969
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,160
Woman.
Did she yell at you?

970
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,700
Yes.
Maybe she just wanted to fuck down,

971
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:24,480
Bro.
You know,

972
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,500
I was just trying to just get you 
vulnerable.

973
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,620
The next thing you know,
come over my house.

974
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,570
I'm going to teach you Spanish.

975
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,470
I'm into children that are 170 pounds 
and five foot tall.

976
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,550
You need to roll.
Oh,

977
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,770
I still can't do that.
I'm like,

978
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,430
wow,
wow,

979
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,550
whoa role now.
I got a dumb fat tongue.

980
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:42,360
Doesn't work.
Really.

981
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:43,250
You can't do it.
I'm like,

982
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:48,270
Rah,
I sound like a fucking car trying to 

983
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:48,270
start up.
God Damn White people I know.

984
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,800
So just ruining everything now.
Wait,

985
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,040
so to jump back to,
to what you were saying about 

986
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,340
mainstream,
do they have any real bad guy?

987
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,630
Yeah.
I get scared when everyone talks about 

988
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,910
stuff in generalities right when I talk 
about.

989
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:07,970
And I'm guilty of it too,
when I talked about like all mainstream 

990
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:07,970
media.
It's not everyone you know.

991
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,820
Um,
but there are.

992
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:13,850
I stopped doing interviews with a 
mainstream outlets several years ago 

993
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,961
because they made everything about like 
I would talk about all the really cool 

994
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:21,651
ventures that we're going into,
how our space is changing things up and 

995
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:25,341
it would always be turned into a one 
comment that maybe was somewhat critical

996
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:29,580
of,
let's say like a studio all become about

997
00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:31,710
that or if all become about the money.

998
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,200
And,
and I was like,

999
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:36,210
you just fucking manipulating what I'm 
saying with this.

1000
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,720
And so the point is become a.
When the Wall Street Journal knocks on 

1001
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,600
Felix's door after they didn't 
apparently approach him for the original

1002
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:45,350
story,
and they're like,

1003
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,380
hey,
we want to give you a platform to tell 

1004
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,380
your story.
It's like,

1005
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,380
fuck you.
Is that what they're doing now?

1006
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,050
Yeah.
The after the story broke and there were

1007
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,340
all these people that came to his 
defense,

1008
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,470
they came to him.
Now I'm not gonna.

1009
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,570
I think that's what a journalist should 
do.

1010
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:01,010
Talk to the fucking.
May Not be different journalists.

1011
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,380
Well,
so I think from what Felix wrote,

1012
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,440
it was the Wall Street Journal.
They left their cards and that's how we 

1013
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,440
knew it was 100 percent of them.

1014
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,270
But why does someone.
I mean what I mean is it different 

1015
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:14,270
journalists from the Wall Street Journal
not the same age to hit.

1016
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,180
I don't know if it was the same ones.
He didn't seek out,

1017
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,660
hey,
we're super sorry.

1018
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,700
We called you a Nazi in front of 
millions of people.

1019
00:42:20,701 --> 00:42:22,110
And we were totally lying.
Yeah.

1020
00:42:22,111 --> 00:42:23,820
But the argument all of a sudden is a 
why,

1021
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,770
why should he do an interview with the 
Wall Street Journal?

1022
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,390
Maybe because they have a different 
audience,

1023
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:31,950
but he has his own larger platform where
he controls the narrative.

1024
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:34,980
He's not going to be selectively,
but he's not speaking to the people that

1025
00:42:34,981 --> 00:42:37,460
the Wall Street Journal risperidone him 
in front of it,

1026
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:42,470
but I would assume that they are also 
covering their ass by going to him and 

1027
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,470
reaching out and giving him a platform.
They can say,

1028
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:48,710
well,
we gave him a chance to respond and the 

1029
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:51,051
facts remain.
He did say those things and they are 

1030
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:51,051
valid.

1031
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:55,220
I think if he was confident enough,
you should probably do what I've seen 

1032
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,050
Milo Yiannopoulos during the past where 
he had someone film at the same time.

1033
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:57,560
So

1034
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,030
did ms dot represent him in some manner?
It doesn't matter.

1035
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,100
It doesn't matter because they've 
already done it.

1036
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,440
They've already misrepresented him in 
the article.

1037
00:43:05,441 --> 00:43:10,441
If they.
If he has someone film his response to 

1038
00:43:10,441 --> 00:43:10,441
that.
I don't know.

1039
00:43:10,441 --> 00:43:13,831
I mean,
I mean just if he did something with 

1040
00:43:13,831 --> 00:43:13,831
them,
right.

1041
00:43:13,831 --> 00:43:17,191
If I did film something,
I understood what the entire thing just 

1042
00:43:17,191 --> 00:43:17,191
so you can show,
but I'm saying it doesn't matter because

1043
00:43:17,191 --> 00:43:19,420
they've already done the damage,
that damaging thing,

1044
00:43:19,421 --> 00:43:24,421
like how many people who read the first 
thing or even going to read the second 

1045
00:43:24,421 --> 00:43:24,421
thing,
right?

1046
00:43:24,421 --> 00:43:28,710
It might even be 30 percent.
That's 70 percent people and how many 

1047
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,341
people just read the Wall Street Journal
and maybe a local paper and our online 

1048
00:43:32,341 --> 00:43:33,910
and aren't hearing all these responses.
And they go,

1049
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:34,510
oh,
you know,

1050
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:35,900
they catch their son.
Oh,

1051
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,360
I'm watching pooty pie.
Oh,

1052
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:39,460
you watched that Nazi,
that a Nazi?

1053
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,480
No,
he's not dead.

1054
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,710
You hate everything I liked

1055
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,990
and now that kid's doing meth,
but the rest of his life.

1056
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,050
No,
I,

1057
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,610
uh,
I,

1058
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,820
I think that it is sad,
right?

1059
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:51,250
That's,
that's a huge problem with,

1060
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,280
with a lot of the fake news or just news
that's false is the crazy salacious 

1061
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,890
shit.
If you then look at the correction,

1062
00:43:57,891 --> 00:44:00,950
half the time that gets like 20 times 
the shares,

1063
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,720
you know why?
Because it's fucking insane.

1064
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:03,860
It's like,
did you see this?

1065
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,100
Did you see this thing?
And it's something that I've been 

1066
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,100
critical of people I like in the 
industry,

1067
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,180
a critical level out of the mainstream 
guys.

1068
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,910
I don't like it.
And it sucks because there's not,

1069
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:16,490
there's not a clear answer.
Do you delete the false thing?

1070
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:18,350
And then it looks like you're hiding 
that information.

1071
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,220
Um,
do you do,

1072
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,070
you should definitely delete the false 
thing.

1073
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:23,420
But.
So that's my argument.

1074
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:25,850
But then there's,
there's an argument that you leave it up

1075
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:28,640
because you show that you were wrong.
If it's on twitter,

1076
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:30,110
you quote tweet it,
but that's still,

1077
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:31,440
that's still doesn't fix it because

1078
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,380
as much as we talk about bubbles and 
separation,

1079
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:39,620
that tweet,
that promotion of a thing is separate 

1080
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,501
from everything else in the world.
Tweets are problematic anyway because 

1081
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:45,321
it's 140 characters and it's very 
difficult to adequately explained some 

1082
00:44:45,321 --> 00:44:48,591
subjects in hundred 40 characters.
But if you put out some information 

1083
00:44:48,591 --> 00:44:48,930
that's not true,
like this pooty pie thing,

1084
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,700
right?
You,

1085
00:44:49,701 --> 00:44:53,130
you absolutely should print a retraction
and you absolutely,

1086
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:58,131
if you have it still up on your website,
the first thing you should say is this 

1087
00:44:58,131 --> 00:45:01,550
is all taken out of context and it's 
incorrect and it's not.

1088
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,340
It does not represent who this guy is 
and you should absolutely not have those

1089
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:06,960
writers do that again.
Right?

1090
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:11,990
I mean,
whether you fire them or whether you 

1091
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,030
assignment,
who knows what they were asked to do.

1092
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,060
This is another part of the problem.
Was this an independent thing that they 

1093
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,550
decided to pursue on their own?

1094
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:22,790
Did someone ask them to do it?
Was there someone who decided that this 

1095
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:26,871
guy was a Nazi because maybe they tuned 
in at the very moment he was doing 

1096
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:26,871
something and they're like,
make.

1097
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:29,430
Some people obviously are very,
very sensitive to that kind of stuff,

1098
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:34,431
so I think that's why it's important,
especially on an editorial team of some 

1099
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,881
sort to have people with with mixed 
opinions because it's very easy to all 

1100
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:39,450
of a sudden get railroaded behind an 
idea of just like,

1101
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:40,050
yeah,
look at these.

1102
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:45,051
Look at these seven specific things.
We're not gonna say that it's out of 

1103
00:45:45,051 --> 00:45:45,051
context,
but look at this information.

1104
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,130
We got this guy we got,
we got this guy dead to rights,

1105
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:48,390
but it's.
It's all flimsy.

1106
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,010
Well,
again,

1107
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:50,970
context,
right?

1108
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:56,300
As soon as you have.
That is part of the problem with doing 

1109
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,320
something like you do and it's certainly
part of the problem with a podcast is if

1110
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:03,321
you're talking for three hours and you 
take these little snippets of those 

1111
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:08,511
three hours out of context,
it paints a completely distorted 

1112
00:46:08,511 --> 00:46:11,601
perception of who the person is,
but that's also a problem with language 

1113
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:12,510
in general.

1114
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,880
It really is a problem with and it's 
certainly a problem with words and 

1115
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,730
that's one of the problems with these 
magic words like that.

1116
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:24,740
You're not supposed to say anymore.
Whatever those words are there,

1117
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,560
you,
you,

1118
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,920
you give the weight gives so much weight
to these words that just taken a loan on

1119
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:35,130
their own.
They can get you in trouble.

1120
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:40,131
Just saying,
uttering the phrase as if it was a 

1121
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:40,131
magic.
Abracadabra.

1122
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:44,330
I think it get you in trouble.
I think it's important that we stopped 

1123
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:44,340
trying to got it rhymes and it's not on 
purpose.

1124
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,070
We have to stop just blindly hating and 
we try and educate.

1125
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:52,340
Right.
I think that don't blindly hate educate 

1126
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,800
an afterschool special star.
Oh God.

1127
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,640
That sounds like straight up.
Something from the navy's skateboard.

1128
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:01,210
You pull up.
Don't hate hate.

1129
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,210
Educate.
Yeah,

1130
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,850
but I mean if you want to talk about 
allies,

1131
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:07,320
you want to talk about people meeting 
you.

1132
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,730
Right.
There was.

1133
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,100
If you turn it into the Trans issue,
right.

1134
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,790
For the longest time I didn't want it 
ever touch the issue because if I use 

1135
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,520
the wrong pronoun,
I was the fucking devil.

1136
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,490
I was the devil and I was like,
just educate me at that time.

1137
00:47:20,491 --> 00:47:25,491
And this is years ago when at that time 
I had never met anyone that was trends.

1138
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:29,720
I was just a completely new concept to 
me and,

1139
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,780
and all of a sudden it was just like I 
said,

1140
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:32,890
he.
When I,

1141
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:37,480
when I should have said she and it was 
like I was the worst person in the world

1142
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:40,930
and people want it to ruin me and ends,
but it's again,

1143
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:43,720
what we're talking about before,
it's not really what they're doing.

1144
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:48,721
What they're doing is trying to find a 
way to control you and call you a bad 

1145
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:49,210
person and be angry at you.

1146
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,960
They could see that it was a mistake or 
if it wasn't a mistake,

1147
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:58,290
you just look.
If someone was a heat for 30 fucking 

1148
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,210
years and they became a sheet for a year
and you still call him a he,

1149
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,760
I don't think you're a monster.
Okay.

1150
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:08,761
I just don't.
We knew Bruce Jenner for his entire leg 

1151
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,550
even saying Bruce Jenner.
Now you're not supposed to say it 

1152
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:14,221
anymore.
When you go and look at the records for 

1153
00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:14,221
the fucking Olympics,
it says Caitlyn Jenner now.

1154
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,030
Yeah.
Well,

1155
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,300
is that true?
Is that real?

1156
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,980
I'm pretty sure that's true.
He's like,

1157
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:18,860
wait,
one second.

1158
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,920
I'm go then.
I'm pretty sure it's true.

1159
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,830
Um,
but so,

1160
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,600
so,
so,

1161
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:23,140
right.
So,

1162
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,270
so I think that's what pushed so many 
people away.

1163
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:27,430
And then the way that I try,
because I try and make,

1164
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,700
I try to make it so no one's the villain
in my head so that I can see where 

1165
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:32,700
they're coming from.

1166
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:32,700
I go,
well,

1167
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,280
maybe that person,
maybe they're not.

1168
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,280
Because there are definitely 
professional victims and cry bullies out

1169
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:41,281
there.
Maybe there's someone that in their day 

1170
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:41,281
to day life,
someone says,

1171
00:48:41,281 --> 00:48:42,230
you fucking tranny.
Maybe they say all this hateful stuff.

1172
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:43,510
No,
I know.

1173
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:45,130
But then they take it out on the wrong 
person.

1174
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:50,131
Right.
I try and see if is this person being 

1175
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:51,010
attacked so much that then they become 
this,

1176
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,070
this accidental monster,
which is what has pushed me more towards

1177
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:55,900
the center.
I went before I came to California.

1178
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:57,440
I was an ultra liberal.
I,

1179
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,130
I hope the most liberal ideas of like,
yeah,

1180
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:05,131
if I.
If I'm a doctor and I'm making 

1181
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:05,131
$3,000,000
a year,

1182
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:06,370
I should give 70 percent.
Like fucking crazy.

1183
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:11,371
Yeah.
You were thinking that because you 

1184
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:11,371
weren't a doctor because I had no 
fucking money.

1185
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:11,940
Fucking money.
Poor people always think like that.

1186
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,940
You want to.
You want to slowly come to the center 

1187
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:16,940
and fucking start a business.
Um,

1188
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,810
but,
but so and then being around people 

1189
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:24,001
everyday,
that's 100 percent because you see the 

1190
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:24,940
problems with many of the arguments.
Um,

1191
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,950
it was,
I think also part of the reason I was 

1192
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:29,950
ultra liberal is there's definitely as 
you're going up a counterculture thing,

1193
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:33,160
and I grew up in the south so it was 
just like everyone's wrong.

1194
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:36,760
And I'm in North Carolina for a while,
Florida for a bit.

1195
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,770
What part of North Carolina?
Asheville.

1196
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,960
Oh,
that's like the hip hop part that's is 

1197
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,030
left is a gas.
Yeah.

1198
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,050
But then you go,
you go,

1199
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,440
you go around,
you start going out and like,

1200
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,690
oh yeah,
just walk straight and you're eventually

1201
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:51,810
going to run into a burning cross.
It's like,

1202
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:55,630
it's like people in hacky sack and then 
hate the writer of the quarter.

1203
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,520
It's an awesome city.
That's great.

1204
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,340
I guess you'd call it town.
It's really too small for a city,

1205
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:03,640
but I played Asheville a few years back 
to get back there.

1206
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:08,970
That's amazing.
There you can go to the fuck was at the 

1207
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:08,970
biltmore house.
They go really small chairs.

1208
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,840
What does that?
It's just like this giant,

1209
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,820
giant comp.
I don't know the history of it,

1210
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,830
but when I went there I was just like,
oh.

1211
00:50:14,831 --> 00:50:17,530
So people used to be like really short.
That's really interesting.

1212
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,200
They really tiny chairs because that's 
how people were back then.

1213
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,360
They were just smaller,
shorter people didn't have any food.

1214
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:27,361
Man Nourished.
If you go back there and give those 

1215
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:27,980
fuckers some God damn American brief.
I forget

1216
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,460
who I was

1217
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,620
listening.
I was blown away.

1218
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,290
I also had the same belief that people 
just died when they were 30.

1219
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,350
Yeah,
it was Chris Ryan,

1220
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,370
wasn't it?
I was looking.

1221
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,080
Infant mortality fucks up the numbers 
and that's the thing.

1222
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,250
It's got to make sure people know that 
no one's infallible.

1223
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,720
You know?
Everyone can be wrong.

1224
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:50,810
Like the.
It's one of those numbers that gets 

1225
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:51,150
incorrectly used.
Like the gender wage gap.

1226
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,580
It's sort of another similar number that
gets incorrectly used.

1227
00:50:53,581 --> 00:50:56,670
People say like women make eighty cents 
to every dollar a man makes.

1228
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,580
Not really.
They do overall,

1229
00:50:59,581 --> 00:51:04,581
but it's not the same jobs.
It's not like the woman is a doctor and 

1230
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:05,400
Amanda doctor man makes a dollar.
The woman who makes eighty cents.

1231
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,270
Now it's like the woman is a nurse and 
the man is a fucking coal miner.

1232
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,230
It's one of those things.
Yeah.

1233
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,520
See,
that's one thing I'd have to dive deep 

1234
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:16,520
and educate myself on because I'm just 
like,

1235
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,250
yes,
that sounds legit,

1236
00:51:17,251 --> 00:51:18,290
but I have to check myself.

1237
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,010
That's a weird one too.
What is this?

1238
00:51:20,011 --> 00:51:23,400
US Olympic Committee will update Bruce 
Jenner's hall of fame plaque to say,

1239
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:26,900
Caitlin,
I saw a headline this morning once I saw

1240
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,040
a headline this morning that said like,
Caitlyn.

1241
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:32,220
Caitlyn said something that like this 
presidencies ridiculous.

1242
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:33,540
And I was like,
why do we care?

1243
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,910
We care more on.
She's a fucking moron.

1244
00:51:35,911 --> 00:51:38,070
Why do we care what celebrities?
But how about this?

1245
00:51:38,071 --> 00:51:41,450
Caitlyn Jenner doesn't believe in 
fucking gay marriage issue.

1246
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,500
Yes.
Gay Marriage.

1247
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,490
I'm more of a traditional worst.
That's what she said.

1248
00:51:47,491 --> 00:51:49,820
Or more of a traditional last.
Uh,

1249
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,080
you definitely not.
Okay.

1250
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,950
I don't know what,
what traditions you're talking about,

1251
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,230
but anytime any of these places get any 
of these celebrities,

1252
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,280
celebrities that have an opinion,
I'm like,

1253
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,140
no,
I think the election proof,

1254
00:52:04,141 --> 00:52:09,141
no one fucking cares.
No one cares what these bucket people 

1255
00:52:09,141 --> 00:52:09,141
said.
Especially Caitlyn Jenner,

1256
00:52:09,141 --> 00:52:13,400
like at the end of the day,
you don't get a free pass just because 

1257
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:13,400
you change your gender.

1258
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,600
You're still judged based on the quality
of your thoughts and how you express 

1259
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,910
yourself and if you are a fucking grown 
adult and you are against gay marriage,

1260
00:52:20,911 --> 00:52:25,680
but you're also transgender.
Your crazy and I know she's buck buckled

1261
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:28,710
down for because of some of the pressure
that people put on it like Ellen and she

1262
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:33,711
kind of like soft into her stance on it,
but the bottom line is you're in your 

1263
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:36,750
fucking sixties and you don't think that
men should be able to get married.

1264
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:41,751
If they're in love with each other.
You're out of your mind or women or 

1265
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:41,880
anybody just fuck off.
It's your stupid.

1266
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,350
See,
I feel like

1267
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,550
I feel like more and more people when I 
started hearing about like this,

1268
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,510
this new kind of Republican I thought it
was,

1269
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:54,120
and I've seen a lot of people will know.
So a lot of people have then talked 

1270
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,140
about,
well it's,

1271
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:00,260
there's this weird thing where it's like
all of a sudden you say new kind of 

1272
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:00,260
Republican.
And they go,

1273
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,131
oh,
so you're talking about white 

1274
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:04,131
supremacist under a whole different 
banner.

1275
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:06,270
I'm talking about when I was talking 
about where people that Republicans,

1276
00:53:06,271 --> 00:53:09,510
I don't give a fuck about gay people 
getting married and they're like,

1277
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,460
I'm about,
I'm Republican because,

1278
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:12,420
you know,
small government,

1279
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,310
right?
And,

1280
00:53:13,311 --> 00:53:13,990
and,
and,

1281
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,560
and jobs.
But not like if gay people get married,

1282
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:17,400
that's fine.
If it's,

1283
00:53:17,401 --> 00:53:20,440
if it's a moral issue like that,
I find myself more liberal and I was,

1284
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:23,610
I all of a sudden became kind of excited
about all these,

1285
00:53:23,611 --> 00:53:24,960
these new people that didn't give a 
fuck.

1286
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,440
And that was interesting to me.
But then when you really see a lot of 

1287
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,880
other stuff that I don't know how to 
feel about a lot of other stuff that you

1288
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:36,870
don't know how I feel about.
What do you mean after?

1289
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,850
I think I had to say it.
Don't beat around the bush.

1290
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:39,120
No,
no.

1291
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:44,210
I'm trying to think how to say it 
because there's these all these fucking 

1292
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:44,210
different avenues.
There's some people that um,

1293
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:48,720
they,
they'll maybe consider themselves all 

1294
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:48,720
right because they just love fucking 
trolling people.

1295
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,620
Like how do I,
how do I trigger someone with some crazy

1296
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:50,850
outrageous thing?
Right.

1297
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:56,050
And it's like I get it.
But then there are people then that you 

1298
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,640
can take it a whole different avenue 
where it's known that,

1299
00:53:57,641 --> 00:53:58,470
that,
that thing,

1300
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,600
it is now white supremacy that pepe the 
frog.

1301
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:02,110
It is.
And to the point where it fucking.

1302
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,140
Hillary Clinton puts a thing on our 
website where she's like,

1303
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:06,820
this is a white supremacist symbol.
That's insane.

1304
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,340
But what is the frog?
Remember?

1305
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:11,160
Pepe the frog get there.
Like it is 100 percent of whites

1306
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,900
premise.
She put that on her website.

1307
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,930
Yes.
This was because Donald trump people 

1308
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:18,930
were using that frog to troll online,
overextend.

1309
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,130
You look like an idiot.
Okay,

1310
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:25,131
but here's.
Here's part of the problem when you're 

1311
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:26,340
talking about people who troll online,
go back to when you were a young liberal

1312
00:54:26,341 --> 00:54:28,860
and you thought that if I was a doctor 
and I was making $3,000,000

1313
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:33,861
a year,
of course I should be given 70 percent 

1314
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:33,861
in taxes.
You don't have that,

1315
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:36,620
so you're looking at the people who do 
and it's part of you is like,

1316
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,800
give it away,
man.

1317
00:54:37,801 --> 00:54:39,210
You shouldn't.
You don't deserve it.

1318
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:42,750
Give it away.
That same mentality exists with trolls.

1319
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,020
They don't have anything going on.
They're fucking losers for the most 

1320
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:48,020
part.
So what do they want to do?

1321
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:51,090
They want to burn it all down.
They want the whole thing burned down.

1322
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,540
Go trump,
go try.

1323
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:58,530
I want the reason why they want to say 
go tropos because they want this clearly

1324
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,060
maniacal person to just throw a fucking 
monkey wrench into the gears and watched

1325
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:06,030
the whole system explode.
That's half of what they're doing.

1326
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,640
They don't have a vested interest in it.
They're not.

1327
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,550
They're not successful.
They're not happy,

1328
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,890
they're not doing well.
I think their role is,

1329
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,180
if you're talking about all trump 
supporters,

1330
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:17,380
I think part of that is true.
I'm not talking about all.

1331
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:17,870
Okay,
okay.

1332
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,620
Because I was talking about all trump 
supporters.

1333
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:22,560
I'm talking about trolls.
Those people with the green frog fucking

1334
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,870
with the crazy hair on their twitter 
profile.

1335
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,260
I mean there's a lot of them that if you
go over their twitter feed,

1336
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,710
their online 13 hours a day,
shitting on people.

1337
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:35,310
I mean that's some people do.
I've gone.

1338
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:40,311
I looked at this,
a few people that I follow and I don't 

1339
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:40,311
follow them either.

1340
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:43,850
I just go to their pay to have them 
bookmarked and I'll go to their page 

1341
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:43,850
like,
look at this crazy asshole.

1342
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,600
What's he been up to today and what 
they've been up to.

1343
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:49,710
Just trolling liberals.
Just going crazy and shitting on that.

1344
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:54,711
Jake Tapper Guy,
boy fucking guy's twitter feed is a 

1345
00:55:54,711 --> 00:55:56,160
mess.
Why?

1346
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,970
Because he,
he fucking summon the ire of the trolls.

1347
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,240
There's a lot of people out there that 
are disenfranchised and very upset and 

1348
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,620
unhappy and,
and just can't wait to burn it down.

1349
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,670
They just want to burn it all down.
They don't have any fucking stake in the

1350
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:13,770
game.
They want it to burn,

1351
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:14,580
you know,

1352
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,180
but then where,
where do we go from that?

1353
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:17,390
I need

1354
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,380
love.
Okay,

1355
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,960
so it's too late.
It's too late.

1356
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:23,060
They get shitty parents.
They live in a shitty neighborhood.

1357
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,360
Their job sucks.
They probably have poor genetics.

1358
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:28,230
They're fucked.
They got to shit handle life and they're

1359
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,560
looking at Kate Upton.
He's handsome man.

1360
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,470
He is.
He's a closet troll.

1361
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,210
You don't even know the opposite of a 
troll.

1362
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,380
They're looking at Kate Upton and her 
beautiful tits and they're like,

1363
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:40,900
fuck her.
Fuck everybody burned down.

1364
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:44,570
Why can't I have this?
Oh conor Mcgregor's got a limousine.

1365
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,860
Light them on fire.
That's what they're doing.

1366
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:50,020
They're mad.
They're not happy,

1367
00:56:50,021 --> 00:56:51,970
they're not successful,
and they get to talk.

1368
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,360
That's a big part of what you have in a 
society where people are being 

1369
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,900
incredibly mean at every opportunity.
When people have the opportunity to 

1370
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,131
troll people are like,
did you see like some of the shit that 

1371
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:05,470
people wrote to patent Oswald after his 
wife died?

1372
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,980
No,
I didn't see anything crazy vicious mean

1373
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,720
evil shit.
And why do they do that?

1374
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,010
Because they want to burn it down.

1375
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:17,540
The one thing I think it's part of it,
part part is going to be that they want 

1376
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,601
to burn it down,
but I think it's just also there are a 

1377
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:20,730
lot of people that don't have the 
concept of shit that we do online having

1378
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,280
potentially horrible ramifications in 
the real world.

1379
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:28,570
I think that slowly we're getting closer
to that where it's all the fucking same 

1380
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,450
thing and if you do some crazy,
outlandish shit,

1381
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:33,240
you should know that a ton of people 
might see it.

1382
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,390
It's why it's one of my favorite things 
to screenshot and and,

1383
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:42,470
and talk back to a few people that say 
stupid shit to me online just because 

1384
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,290
it's like you think that you're saying 
it in this tiny room,

1385
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:45,300
but the Internet's fucking everybody in 
a room.

1386
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,450
Everyone like what you say has 
ramifications.

1387
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,440
Well,
not only that,

1388
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:54,441
you shouldn't want to say it,
so you have to get to the root of the 

1389
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:54,441
problem.

1390
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:54,441
Like,
what?

1391
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:57,540
Why would someone want to be so evil?
Why would someone want to hurt someone's

1392
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:00,030
feelings so badly that you're mocking 
his.

1393
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,190
I think there are a lot of people that 
fit just died.

1394
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:07,310
So that's,
that's a fucking horrible emotional 

1395
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:07,310
example.
But when and why?

1396
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:12,080
Right.
So what I would say separately from 

1397
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,881
that,
if you're talking about trolling 

1398
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:13,881
liberals or something like that,
um,

1399
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:15,930
I think that there are people that want 
to burn the whole thing down.

1400
00:58:15,931 --> 00:58:20,931
And then I think there are some people 
that literally they have the mindset 

1401
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:20,931
that it's just for laughs,
right?

1402
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:20,931
Well,
it's,

1403
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:21,600
that's not him.
Yeah.

1404
00:58:21,601 --> 00:58:26,601
And so,
and so it's one of those things where I 

1405
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:30,890
don't know,
I don't think was people are inherently 

1406
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,751
evil.
I think that especially if you're 

1407
00:58:32,751 --> 00:58:33,120
talking about like a Patton Oswald thing
that's incredibly wrong and horrible,

1408
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,790
but it's like,
Mike,

1409
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,300
my question becomes like,
how do I,

1410
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:37,710
how do I talk to that person?

1411
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,790
Right?
How do I not a,

1412
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,240
how do you talk to who?
Patton Oswald with trolls,

1413
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:45,810
the trolls when you got to go back in 
time to when the mother was raising them

1414
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:50,811
and take them away from the Mama and 
bring them to a happy person and give 

1415
00:58:50,811 --> 00:58:52,320
them love and lots of hugs.
I think people,

1416
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:57,321
as long as,
as long as you don't automatically call 

1417
00:58:57,321 --> 00:58:57,330
someone the villain,
I think that you can get some people,

1418
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,130
not all of them because some people,
like you said,

1419
00:58:59,131 --> 00:59:02,880
they want to call them the villain when 
they're a troll,

1420
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,130
when they're evil.
So is that what you mean?

1421
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,690
Yes.
When they're maybe saying something they

1422
00:59:06,691 --> 00:59:11,691
would see as evil and things when I'm 
not talking about the patent Oswald 

1423
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:12,600
situation,
because if you go after someone grieving

1424
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:17,601
over their wife,
you're a fucking horrible monster and 

1425
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:20,390
hopefully you.
You do understand that that has a real 

1426
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:20,910
world ramifications or not.
If you're just an,

1427
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,100
you might be able to get

1428
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,870
away with it.
He just a little egg,

1429
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:29,020
you know,
fuck face 69 on twitter and you can get 

1430
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,140
away with it.
They'll ban your account,

1431
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:31,160
whatever.
Ha Ha.

1432
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:32,240
Yeah,
I got them.

1433
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:37,780
I mean,
that's what you're doing and trying to 

1434
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:37,780
get a reaction.
It's like you're playing a game.

1435
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:40,631
You're right,
you're playing operation and when that 

1436
00:59:40,631 --> 00:59:41,470
tweezer hits the sides and like,
hi,

1437
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,010
I saw it.
It happened.

1438
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,140
It was a thing.
Yeah,

1439
00:59:44,141 --> 00:59:45,260
it was a thing,
right?

1440
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,390
Yeah.
I don't know.

1441
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,210
I just,
I'm not gonna do it myself.

1442
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:49,760
Of course,
you know,

1443
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,430
but I want to,
I want to try and talk.

1444
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,720
I want to talk to people,
man.

1445
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,140
You do.
Why don't you like that?

1446
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,290
You have a show,
reach out show like A.

1447
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,230
it'll be hell for two weeks and then 
it'll just be.

1448
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:04,980
I'll get,
I'll end up on one of those fucking 

1449
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,560
Howard stern things where they just have
those people that get trolled the entire

1450
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:07,030
time.
It's like we have another caller.

1451
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:08,020
God Damn.

1452
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:11,060
It could be windy city heat.
You could have a whole movie about it.

1453
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:12,470
Yeah.
They don't need to know about it.

1454
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,710
Yeah,
I,

1455
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,170
I just,
it's,

1456
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,300
it's a,
a new thing.

1457
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:21,590
It's a new thing for human beings.
This unbridled communication ability.

1458
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:22,480
Yeah,
and there's going to.

1459
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,410
Here's the thing,
there's going to be the whole like,

1460
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,910
let's destroy each other war.
I'm just going to try and be the asshole

1461
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:31,930
that's in the middle with with leanings 
here and there that tries to go like,

1462
01:00:31,931 --> 01:00:33,250
hey,
maybe we fucking calm down.

1463
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:38,460
That's not the best thing for my career 
because I would have a far larger 

1464
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,020
audience if I,
if I pandered to just one side because I

1465
01:00:41,021 --> 01:00:44,170
alienated people daily by having left 
views and then right views.

1466
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,100
Wait,
that's so crazy.

1467
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:51,330
You will,
you really think that your audience 

1468
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:51,330
would be bigger if you just picked a 
side.

1469
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:52,100
Yes.
Are you kidding me?

1470
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:52,610
Like,
who?

1471
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:57,740
I think that crowd is very favor.
Crowder is fantastic.

1472
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:59,840
He's very,
he's one of the fair guys.

1473
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:01,850
Um,
but I think he does a great job.

1474
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,480
You have a bigger audience in,
you know,

1475
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:04,610
oh,
bigger than me.

1476
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,230
You're crazy.
Your audience is way bigger than his.

1477
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,750
You have five fucking million youtube.

1478
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,900
I mean,
daily active as like a million.

1479
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,730
So.
Right.

1480
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,980
That's a lot.
Right?

1481
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,870
But I'm talking Tomi Lahren is a 
fantastic example.

1482
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,900
Okay.
Tomi Lahren hits tens of billions on 

1483
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:23,900
facebook.
Example,

1484
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,050
hot girl and the conservative Jews out 
there,

1485
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:30,051
grease in their guns,
the decanter lefthand that are super 

1486
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:30,051
excited about that.
They love

1487
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:32,620
a hot conservative Va.
She's mean she don't like mexicans,

1488
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,750
but she is very one side,
right?

1489
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:40,490
Yes.
It can be under the veil of.

1490
01:01:40,491 --> 01:01:42,360
I hate Snowflakes,
but there's,

1491
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:47,370
there's hypocrisy in that a little bit 
in the sense of every time she's 

1492
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:51,131
screaming,
she does seem like a snowflake on some 

1493
01:01:51,131 --> 01:01:51,131
of the topics,
but putting things,

1494
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:56,160
don't you think that's for effect though
for dramatic effect because half of it 

1495
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:56,160
is performance.
All right,

1496
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:56,160
but that's the thing,
right?

1497
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,971
But it's aimed at one group of people 
and you've seen the massive rise where 

1498
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:02,810
it started as this kind of small thing.
It blew up.

1499
01:02:02,811 --> 01:02:07,811
Now you see her on fox news,
but she doesn't even need that because 

1500
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:10,421
she has a giant platforM.
It's definitely a good move for her to 

1501
01:02:10,421 --> 01:02:10,970
be on fox news.
Right?

1502
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:14,000
It's a different audience,
but it is playing to one side.

1503
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:16,400
I still don't think she's as big as you.
I think so.

1504
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:17,900
Nothing.
So go to her.

1505
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:18,000
Her,

1506
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,470
um,
her twitter feed.

1507
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,010
Find out what

1508
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,260
our twitter feed is,
how many she has,

1509
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,450
and then go.
How many twitter feed people you got?

1510
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,630
800,000.
I'm not huge on a bet shit.

1511
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,320
I'm actually as the last.
What about her?

1512
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,710
Did she have to look at the engagement 
though?

1513
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:34,110
Because she mentioned you're one of 
those guys.

1514
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:36,420
You paying attention.
I don't pay attention to.

1515
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:37,420
No,
that's no.

1516
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,280
You don't care about the engagement.
if you're a sales guy and you're like,

1517
01:02:40,281 --> 01:02:41,570
he has 5 million.

1518
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,460
What did she got here at 6:40.
Oh,

1519
01:02:43,461 --> 01:02:46,670
you've got a beat or engagements or 
engagements?

1520
01:02:46,671 --> 01:02:49,010
A little low.
how weird.

1521
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,910
Oh,
she's got her.

1522
01:02:49,911 --> 01:02:52,340
Hashtag final thoughts.
Fuck off tommy.

1523
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:55,220
Oh fuck.
Off of your final thoughts.

1524
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:56,440
Get outta here.

1525
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,560
She,
like you were saying whether you 

1526
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:01,560
consider it,
whether you consider it performance art,

1527
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,611
whether you consider it anything and it 
plays one side and it has been a very 

1528
01:03:05,611 --> 01:03:06,070
massive successful rise.
I think that,

1529
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,900
but what I want to do for the longterm.

1530
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,130
Okay.
He is not taking that into account.

1531
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,290
Like you're saying that if you went one 
way,

1532
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:18,910
show me another guy who's gone one way 
who looks like you have reasonable,

1533
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,880
normal looking fella.
You're not a thing.

1534
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:24,280
Some super buff,
a pro athlete or some,

1535
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:29,660
uh,
androgynous weirdo that people can't 

1536
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,550
take their eyes away from your,
just a regular guy

1537
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:35,680
king if you're looking at maybe like 
monthly views on owned and operated 

1538
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:35,680
sites,
youtube,

1539
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,750
all the other places.
Uh,

1540
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:40,010
the young turks who I'm not really a 
like,

1541
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:43,400
I know them,
but I'm not a fan of the messaging a lot

1542
01:03:43,401 --> 01:03:45,200
of the time.
They're massive.

1543
01:03:45,201 --> 01:03:45,890
I think they get more,

1544
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,630
been around a long time doing that stuff
though.

1545
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,170
They get a lot of monthly views,
but they also get a lot of hate,

1546
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:58,171
man.
There's a lot of people that hate watch 

1547
01:03:58,171 --> 01:03:58,800
jank comments.
Woo.

1548
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,940
They go after him.
He should have.

1549
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,760
He should watch youtube for like a 
binder.

1550
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:13,090
We could only look at the video shit on.
We can't read the comments at all.

1551
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,090
Hire someone that only reads the 
comments,

1552
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,030
don't read them at all.
Don't even engaged.

1553
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,170
Stay away.

1554
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:25,570
That I liked.
I liked the conversations on mine 

1555
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:25,570
though.
I mean you have people that are,

1556
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,830
that are really passionate,
but then there are a lot of threads 

1557
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:28,830
where it's like people having 
conversations that didn't work normally

1558
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:30,130
agree with each other.
While I'm saying this,

1559
01:04:30,131 --> 01:04:35,131
the whole reason why I said in the first
place is more of a compliment than 

1560
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:37,681
anything.
I think it's a great thing that you're 

1561
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:37,681
very.
Like,

1562
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:41,220
here's a perfect example.
The way you handled the milo 

1563
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,070
yiannopoulos thing.
I think you're very fair and I think.

1564
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:45,250
I think it's great that you're neither 
left nor right,

1565
01:04:45,251 --> 01:04:47,320
but rather reasonable.
You know,

1566
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:50,230
you're reasonable and considered and I 
think that's one of your strengths.

1567
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:52,990
I don't think you would have a bigger 
audience if you just went all right.

1568
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,050
I think you'd be a big old phony and 
less less.

1569
01:04:56,060 --> 01:05:00,360
You became felina and then then you,
you,

1570
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:05,361
you got some tits and put on a nice 
little dress and then you could wear 

1571
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:07,390
like a sleeveless shirts,
you know,

1572
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,920
because right now if you wear sleeveless
shirts,

1573
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:10,930
you're a douche bag because you're a 
male,

1574
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:14,230
right?
If You're a man and you show your arms,

1575
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:15,010
you're a piece of shit,

1576
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,530
so I got to start going to the gym 
because I no one wants to see that.

1577
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:17,830
Now

1578
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:23,240
they would.
Maybe they'd be lIke lena dunham type 

1579
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:23,240
thing,
even bigger.

1580
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:23,330
So if you're going to go and become a 
woman,

1581
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:26,300
you either become a hot woman or a 
fucking sloppy one.

1582
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:30,260
A really sloppy one who celebrates food 
and this is who I am.

1583
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,670
Love it.
Or leave it.

1584
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,530
Fuck off.
I find that finally

1585
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:37,250
the lena dunham's end up doing more 
damage to their cars then then good.

1586
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:42,420
Or she has 100 million twitter followers
and she's got food stuck in our teeth 

1587
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:42,990
and no one gives a shit.
Big old fuck.

1588
01:05:42,991 --> 01:05:46,750
Fucking sloppy arms like a,
like a 300 pound man's legs.

1589
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,910
This is nothing wrong with it.

1590
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:51,460
I,
uh,

1591
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,210
I remember like a few days before the 
election,

1592
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:58,211
she put out this fucking animated video 
where she was talking with her dad and 

1593
01:05:58,211 --> 01:05:58,400
was the,
it was the death of the white male.

1594
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:00,320
And I was like,
oh,

1595
01:06:00,321 --> 01:06:05,321
that's awesome.
Women empowerment by destruction of 

1596
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:05,321
another dope.

1597
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:10,300
Amazing.
She's doing it all on a platform 

1598
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:10,900
invented by white males.
How bizarre.

1599
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,690
True,
true gel.

1600
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:15,480
It's called the internet.
Actually.

1601
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,160
I know al gore and he invented his movie
so white.

1602
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,630
Well,
the death of the white male,

1603
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,220
but whether it be like,
well,

1604
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:27,860
those people don't want to fuck me.
Death.

1605
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,330
Oh god.
When it was the odell beckham jr thing,

1606
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:33,190
did you see that?
This was a while ago.

1607
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:38,191
She sat at the same table and she wrote 
this whole post about how he looked at 

1608
01:06:38,191 --> 01:06:39,580
her like she was a piece of garbage and 
he was like,

1609
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:40,870
what?
What are you talking about?

1610
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:45,040
I was just trying to be humorous.
Did you say the humorous thing?

1611
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,480
I dunno.
It's because I think she,

1612
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,160
because she wrote this.
Then apology where she was like,

1613
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:50,090
it was all in my head.
It's like,

1614
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:50,340
ah,

1615
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:55,490
got it.
Did you try to not mention her as much 

1616
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:56,050
as possible,
but it happens so often.

1617
01:06:56,450 --> 01:07:01,450
You know,
the weirdest thing was how she was 

1618
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:01,450
giving a free pass for sexually 
assaulting her young

1619
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:06,110
cisco.
The weird like shoving things up her 

1620
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:06,110
vagina when she was little.
Like,

1621
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:06,840
what will.
So that's where,

1622
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,410
that's where when you say like,
I'm reasonable with the milo thing,

1623
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:14,490
well,
because you have to take into context 

1624
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:14,490
other other people,
right?

1625
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:14,490
Is it,
is it a hit job,

1626
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:19,061
but also what you said earlier where 
people are human beings and like let's 

1627
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:19,670
talk it out.
So milo said some,

1628
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,820
some things that even he said he 
apologized for others,

1629
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:27,020
he said was misconstrued but.
But it's.

1630
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:30,500
And then there's the george decay thing 
which is different but still the same

1631
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:36,360
two k thing you have to explain to 
people because most people have no idea 

1632
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:36,360
what you're talking about.
So sorry.

1633
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,130
Yeah.
So this is a problem for me.

1634
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,840
I have conversations in my head that 
then I,

1635
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,050
other words here are just so entrenched 
with media.

1636
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,680
So much shit coming into your head 
everyday.

1637
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,850
The assume everybody else is watching 
the same video.

1638
01:07:46,851 --> 01:07:48,410
So they're,
they're actually living their lives.

1639
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:53,411
so they went on,
they did a hit piece on george decay 

1640
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:53,510
essentially to sort of show that george 
takei.

1641
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:59,350
Well,
he was talking about his own personal 

1642
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:01,031
experiences when he was very young with 
a camp counselor who did some sexually 

1643
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:04,751
inappropriate things to him,
but he was talking about them in a very 

1644
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:07,211
positive way that he enjoyed it and 
people are saying george decay is 

1645
01:08:07,211 --> 01:08:08,930
promoting sex amongst 13 year olds as 
being okay.

1646
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:14,110
No,
he's talking about his own personal 

1647
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:14,110
experience and being honest about it.

1648
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:14,110
Well,
and then the way that ends up becoming a

1649
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:19,061
comparison is the.
Because it ends up being this weird 

1650
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,440
argument of numbers of lines in the sand
where he said,

1651
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:24,320
I said 13 because that's when I had my 
first experience.

1652
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,550
Then we talked about the the age of.
Oh god,

1653
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,330
I'm trying to remember.
He talked about the age of 14,

1654
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,790
which was a,
I think when you were.

1655
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:35,370
So that was a conversation he had with 
you with the situation.

1656
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:40,800
Right.
And then people were pointing out that 

1657
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,821
it's his.
His mindset changed and my argument 

1658
01:08:42,821 --> 01:08:42,821
there was what you're talking about.
To me,

1659
01:08:42,821 --> 01:08:44,870
even if he at the end,
at any point before,

1660
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:48,170
before he acknowledged it,
it to me it sounded like he was a victim

1661
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:53,980
and,
but then that creates the argument too 

1662
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,250
of if someone's a victim early in life,
what does that excuse later on?

1663
01:08:55,250 --> 01:09:00,250
Now I'm not making the argument that 
milo then went on to do and became a 

1664
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:01,630
sandusky,
right?

1665
01:09:01,631 --> 01:09:06,631
He,
he was having a conversation and it's 

1666
01:09:06,631 --> 01:09:06,631
words,
but at what point do we excuse things?

1667
01:09:06,631 --> 01:09:11,291
And that's just like,
that's a conversation I'd like to have 

1668
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:11,291
where it's,
it's not damning.

1669
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:14,420
I don't want to go in on a victim,
but also at the same time I'm going,

1670
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,560
it's fucking weird to me and I think 
it's completely wrong if you have an 

1671
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,420
adult,
let's try and fuck a 13 year old.

1672
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:25,690
I think that's completely wrong.
Like just when you feel like you always 

1673
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:25,730
have to put people in,
in your,

1674
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:26,340
uh,
in,

1675
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,150
in their shoes.
Where if I was a parent and I'm dropping

1676
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:34,151
my kid off the fucking middle school and
I find out some 25 year old is fucking 

1677
01:09:34,151 --> 01:09:35,030
my son that's going to.
I'm going to go to jail,

1678
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:36,680
but that's gonna be a fucking dead 
person.

1679
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:42,160
A dead person.
One hundred percent that someone's 

1680
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:42,160
molesting my child.
No.

1681
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:42,160
Done.

1682
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,240
Yeah,
I mean,

1683
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:47,360
I completely feel you and I understand 
what you're saying.

1684
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:52,690
I think with the milo situation is very 
bizarre because I think there is 

1685
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:56,630
irreparable damage done to people when 
they're molested as children and I think

1686
01:09:56,631 --> 01:10:00,530
milo has been really clear about the 
fact that he was molested and he's tried

1687
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:04,310
to paint it in a positive light,
but he tries to paint a lot of fucked up

1688
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:09,311
things in a positive light and it could 
easily be his rationalizing and trying 

1689
01:10:09,311 --> 01:10:10,830
to figure out.
No one wants to be a victim in their own

1690
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,190
life.
Made it a positive thing.

1691
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,000
Control it was him.
Yeah.

1692
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,350
So that's why I say like,
let's,

1693
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:19,290
let's think of it in that way.
Rather than going,

1694
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,720
he's against me.
Let's just destroy him.

1695
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,790
Well,
I think the besides outlandish thing

1696
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,480
that milo does that.
I mean,

1697
01:10:25,481 --> 01:10:30,481
he's a merchant of outrage.
That's his business and when people get 

1698
01:10:30,481 --> 01:10:34,351
outraged back at him and if somehow 
another sticks like this pedophile 

1699
01:10:34,351 --> 01:10:36,160
stuff,
you can't be upset.

1700
01:10:36,161 --> 01:10:37,960
This is the game that you just started 
to play.

1701
01:10:37,961 --> 01:10:40,860
If you get knocked the fuck out,
you know if your bike tyson and all of a

1702
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,300
sudden you get knocked out,
are we supposed to feel bad for you?

1703
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,280
You've been knocking people out your 
whole career.

1704
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,800
This,
he's a merchant of outrage.

1705
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:50,890
If it's valid,
if the outrage is valid and I think it's

1706
01:10:50,891 --> 01:10:55,891
valid.
I think that what they're saying about 

1707
01:10:55,891 --> 01:10:58,801
what he was saying is absolutely valid.
If he says that there can be incredibly 

1708
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:03,451
positive relationships between very 
young men and our young boys rather an 

1709
01:11:03,451 --> 01:11:06,130
older gay men and that this could keep 
men from suicide,

1710
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,920
hit the brakes,
stop.

1711
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:14,070
No,
it's fucking illegal for a reason and 

1712
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,371
you could potentially be encouraging 
someone whose fence sitting right now 

1713
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:22,161
thinking about fucking kids to hop right
over to the other side and start doing 

1714
01:11:22,161 --> 01:11:23,700
it because it was positive for my low.
It does because it was beneficial.

1715
01:11:23,701 --> 01:11:24,840
It is the conversation

1716
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:28,320
also to that extent.
There might be someone that is 13 that's

1717
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:30,360
being abused that all of a sudden it 
feels like that's normal.

1718
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,010
Right.
So,

1719
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,660
but let's,
let's talk about it.

1720
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,220
I 100 percent,
don't agree with the words.

1721
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:40,370
It is a tricky situation because you are
talking about someone that was a victim 

1722
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:43,430
of a heinous crime and then just talking
about talking about it and going from 

1723
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:44,430
there.

1724
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:47,000
But it's also he said that he was gay at
the time.

1725
01:11:47,001 --> 01:11:52,001
He knew he was gay and he was.
The sexual predator in every situation 

1726
01:11:52,001 --> 01:11:52,580
has its own variables.
Right.

1727
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:57,470
And in his look,
he's clearly a damaged guy.

1728
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,760
OkAy.
And I liked him.

1729
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:02,510
He's clearly a damaged guy,
but the way he lashes out and the way he

1730
01:12:02,511 --> 01:12:07,040
gets attention,
I don't like the left's reaction to him.

1731
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:10,190
I like that far less than.
I like what he's saying.

1732
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:14,420
I feel like with a guy like milo,
he's not doing any real violent things.

1733
01:12:14,421 --> 01:12:19,421
He's not doing any real damage.
And what you should do is confront him 

1734
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:19,421
with words,
bait him,

1735
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:24,410
pick apart his arguments about feminism,
about transgender people,

1736
01:12:24,411 --> 01:12:29,411
about gay rights,
because he's got some crazy writes 

1737
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,751
about,
he's got some crazy thoughts about gay 

1738
01:12:31,751 --> 01:12:33,431
people and he's gay.
He thinks that it's a choice and he 

1739
01:12:33,431 --> 01:12:33,431
thinks that it's a,
it's offensive.

1740
01:12:33,431 --> 01:12:35,420
And if he could have a pill to not be 
gay,

1741
01:12:35,421 --> 01:12:37,580
you would take it in a heartbeat.
And like he said,

1742
01:12:37,581 --> 01:12:38,540
all kinds of crazy shit.

1743
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,830
What do you have someone like milo or 
anyone else?

1744
01:12:40,831 --> 01:12:43,380
The number one thing shouldn't be,
let me silence that person.

1745
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,870
Right?
Because that's just going to one,

1746
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,470
bolster them,
validate them,

1747
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,500
let them talk.
Right?

1748
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:50,320
So when,
when you see situations like,

1749
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,950
like berkeley,
where I did see,

1750
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:55,180
I had people that sent me videos and 
there was like,

1751
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:00,200
there was a protest in the beginning 
that it was just people being outspoken 

1752
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,141
and there's a fucking crazy chaos.
People I know that you've talked about 

1753
01:13:03,141 --> 01:13:06,471
before,
of like the people getting sprayed in 

1754
01:13:06,471 --> 01:13:06,471
the face with fucking pepper spray 
people beaten in the streets.

1755
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,370
Obviously.
I hate those people.

1756
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,930
What?
What I really,

1757
01:13:09,931 --> 01:13:13,050
really hate is the people that aren't 
doing that,

1758
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:13,950
they're like,
yeah,

1759
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,680
that's what we should be doing that 
aren't doing like,

1760
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:19,020
are you fucking crazy?
You think this is a positive.

1761
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,220
You think this bolsters your argument 
that that we're going to go against what

1762
01:13:23,221 --> 01:13:26,520
we don't agree them that they're saying 
with fucking violence.

1763
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,440
You think that makes you the winter.
That's insane.

1764
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,900
It straight up and saying,

1765
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,290
well,
it's also the.

1766
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:34,950
They put these blanket labels.
He's a nazi.

1767
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,230
He promotes genocide.
He,

1768
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:40,800
they say all these things and they say 
these things so that they can attack.

1769
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,690
Well,
there was a whole.

1770
01:13:41,691 --> 01:13:42,230
Yeah,
that whole.

1771
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:47,210
He's a fascist nazi movement.
After Richard Spencer got punched in the

1772
01:13:47,211 --> 01:13:48,680
face,
which once again,

1773
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:50,150
who's Richard Spencer or.
Wait,

1774
01:13:50,151 --> 01:13:50,390
wait,
wait.

1775
01:13:50,391 --> 01:13:55,010
Am I getting the name wrong now?
The guy that will double check.

1776
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:55,800
Go ahead.
You've.

1777
01:13:55,820 --> 01:14:00,550
You've made me doubt myself.
Now he's part of a two,

1778
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:00,790
two,
two,

1779
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:01,000
two,
two,

1780
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:01,910
two.
You might be right.

1781
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:05,570
I mean I'm definitely.
I just don't know who it is.

1782
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:07,130
Yeah,
you always.

1783
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:12,190
You always see his face.
He just got booted out of c pack for my 

1784
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:12,190
understanding,
so he's.

1785
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:12,220
He talks

1786
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,970
about just look them up.
You're not going to.

1787
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,500
I imagine you aren't going to be a fan,
but people were like,

1788
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:20,320
he's a literal nazi.
We got to punch these people that people

1789
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:24,490
like overjoyed,
so he really is a nazi people just happy

1790
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,230
supremacist.
This guy,

1791
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,780
I don't want to.
I don't want to label this guy on it.

1792
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:33,781
I think that you would call himself a 
white nationalist or anything like that 

1793
01:14:33,781 --> 01:14:35,830
on the website.
Oh,

1794
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:38,550
he's neo nazi nazi everywhere.
I don't know if he calls himself that.

1795
01:14:38,551 --> 01:14:39,280
I'll double check.
Yeah,

1796
01:14:39,281 --> 01:14:40,180
that's the thing.
I don't want to.

1797
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:42,760
I don't want to slam a label on someone 
and then do that thing.

1798
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,710
Right.
So it's hard,

1799
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:46,480
but.
So he got punched in the face.

1800
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:49,300
Everyone fucking cheered for it,
but the problem is then then they move.

1801
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:50,440
Then you move.
The goalposts have,

1802
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:51,580
who's a fucking nazi.

1803
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,190
All of a sudden cutie pies.
A fucking nazi ever.

1804
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:59,200
Ever.
Everyone's a nazi and we can just be 

1805
01:14:59,200 --> 01:14:59,200
violent.
Punch nazis.

1806
01:14:59,200 --> 01:14:59,590
Yeah.
The punch nazi thing.

1807
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,680
And so the whole.
The whole thing is just debate these 

1808
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:04,680
people,
right?

1809
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,040
So like just just let them be their own 
undoing if they are actually that wrong.

1810
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,480
Well,
I think there's a.

1811
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:11,800
Does a giant problem with groups humans 
when groups of humans get together.

1812
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:15,250
I mean that phrase mob mentality exists 
for a reason.

1813
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,090
It's not,
you don't say mob mentality.

1814
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:17,650
People go,
why?

1815
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:19,210
Whatever.
Do you mean philly date?

1816
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,100
What?
What is a mob mentality?

1817
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:22,540
No,
people know it happens.

1818
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:27,750
Giant groups of people face something 
called diffusion of responsibility and 

1819
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:28,420
that means when chaotic events are going
on,

1820
01:15:28,421 --> 01:15:33,421
they don't take responsibility for their
own actions because they're a part of 

1821
01:15:33,421 --> 01:15:34,210
this gigantic,
chaotic movement and I personally,

1822
01:15:34,211 --> 01:15:35,890
and this is just totally unfounded.

1823
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:40,890
I'm definitely not a scientist.
I think he came from war and I think 

1824
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:44,251
people are used to large scale tribal 
war and I think it's been going on for 

1825
01:15:44,251 --> 01:15:46,750
so long and the atrocities that are 
required for you to survive and war,

1826
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,840
like battle axes and shit,
braveheart style.

1827
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:55,170
I think once that breaks out,
you'd lock into this massive mind sync 

1828
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,970
with all the people around you and you 
use.

1829
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:02,971
Except this violent chaos and I think 
that happens on campuses when people 

1830
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,350
burn it down,
burn it down,

1831
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:08,970
that is the same mindset.
EveryoNe is involved in this,

1832
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:14,490
this hurricane of chaos and you just get
swept up in this mob mentality and it's 

1833
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:16,790
a really dangerous thing.
You know,

1834
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:21,791
like I'm sure you saw the girl that got 
maced in the Face that had the matan 

1835
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:22,960
bitcoin great again hat and he hit her 
over the head with a stick.

1836
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,150
Like,
what in the fuck are you doing?

1837
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:26,050
Yeah.
If you think that's okay,

1838
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:28,870
I think you're in the wrong 100 percent.
It's just a girl.

1839
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:32,380
Just a girl nonviolent non non non 
motion.

1840
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,970
She was,
she was stationary.

1841
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:39,230
She's not threatening whatsoever.
I think if you listen to the audio 

1842
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:39,230
before all of it happens outside of that
clip,

1843
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:40,300
she's,
she's literally saying,

1844
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:45,810
I'm actually surprised things are pretty
calm here because sometimes things go 

1845
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,190
out of hand and then 20 seconds later 
pepper spray to the face,

1846
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:52,360
they just decided that her hat was a 
trump hat and so they just blasted her.

1847
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,040
It wasn't even a trump hat.
I mean,

1848
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:59,041
it's just,
it had the right font so she had to get 

1849
01:16:59,041 --> 01:17:02,520
punished and that's so I feel like 
that's the big thing of understanding 

1850
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,420
whether it'd be a 60 year old maN that 
did it to her too,

1851
01:17:03,421 --> 01:17:05,210
or she don't know that something insane,
don't know that.

1852
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,890
Find out that because someone,
someone told me that,

1853
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,100
that it was a 60 year old man that

1854
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,740
a pepper sprayed her in the face.
So,

1855
01:17:11,741 --> 01:17:14,060
I mean obviously we're talking about 
different kinds of severity,

1856
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:16,120
but there are people on both sides and 
it's,

1857
01:17:16,121 --> 01:17:21,121
it's important to acknowledge that,
that want to burn the whole fucking 

1858
01:17:21,121 --> 01:17:24,341
thing down.
Whether it be a person or an argument 

1859
01:17:24,341 --> 01:17:24,920
for your 60 year old man,
you're still a fucking loser and there's

1860
01:17:24,921 --> 01:17:27,110
a pretty girl in front of you and you're
like,

1861
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,550
fuck you.
And I was young.

1862
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,550
Uh,
yeah.

1863
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,470
Nazis.
It's ridiculous,

1864
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:37,300
man.
I,

1865
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:42,310
I'm a very much of the belief that we 
have rather than more and more people 

1866
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:46,721
are putting in talking about 
generalities where it's the left versus 

1867
01:17:46,721 --> 01:17:46,721
the right.
I feel like a lot of the conversation,

1868
01:17:46,721 --> 01:17:48,230
a lot of the stories end up being about 
these,

1869
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:53,231
these far left and far right.
People that are like fucking pack 

1870
01:17:53,231 --> 01:17:56,171
manning their way to the middle and just
slowly absorbing more and more people 

1871
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:56,450
into,
into their opinion.

1872
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:59,480
And what's scary is if they ever do get 
to the center,

1873
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,360
right.
If it does become all of us in a,

1874
01:18:02,361 --> 01:18:06,110
an us versus them on facebook,
it's a lot closer to that in real life.

1875
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:08,440
so how,
so after the.

1876
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:13,540
After the election,
I don't know about your personal like 

1877
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:14,120
family and friend group,
but how many people like cut off contact

1878
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:16,550
with each other for awhile because on 
mine,

1879
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:18,650
holy fuck.
It was like war.

1880
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,160
It was war ending of relationships that 
had,

1881
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:23,390
had,
had been longer than a decade.

1882
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:26,150
And sally,
your family,

1883
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,890
family members,
some of most of it,

1884
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:29,960
a lot of its extended,
extended family.

1885
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:33,490
What happened?
Just just people just saying like,

1886
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,050
well one there was,
there was a,

1887
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,830
I come from a family that they're,
they're fine with like independence.

1888
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:44,860
So there was rIght after the election,
there was that whole like all 

1889
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:44,860
independence did this.

1890
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:47,450
Even in California,
if you voted for fucking anybody,

1891
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,470
you voted for jill stein,
you took away from client.

1892
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,640
Do you know how the electoral college 
works?

1893
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:53,890
You fucking idiot.
Oh,

1894
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,790
California is going to go to someone 
else.

1895
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:02,340
But yeah,
just people going to each other because 

1896
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:02,340
they're like,
if you voted for trump,

1897
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:02,340
you're a racist,
sexist,

1898
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:04,400
a monster.
And if you voted for hillary,

1899
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:09,780
you wanted people to not have healthcare
and she's a fucking crook and should be 

1900
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:12,110
in jail and just train the swamp.
Yeah,

1901
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:14,440
I went to,
I went to like,

1902
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,270
I love the people I work with,
but I went like emotions were high.

1903
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:19,250
People at the,
at my office were like,

1904
01:19:19,251 --> 01:19:24,251
we have a team of like 40 outside of my 
group of people were crying like it was 

1905
01:19:24,251 --> 01:19:27,940
chaos.
I know dude who was in the cia and he 

1906
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,210
was telling me about his office where he
works at.

1907
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,090
One of the women at the office was 
openly weeping.

1908
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:33,980
Oh wow.
And he's like a,

1909
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,510
hey,
that's a.

1910
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:38,990
Can't do that here.
This is a place for that.

1911
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:42,830
This is a week free zone who can't weep 
over democracy.

1912
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:44,890
Not going your way.
I mean for a lot of.

1913
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:47,450
For a lot of liberals I knew it was like
a national day of mourning.

1914
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,680
Yeah.
And then for,

1915
01:19:48,681 --> 01:19:50,620
for everyone else that voted for him 
though,

1916
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:53,060
it was the day that will always 
remember,

1917
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:58,150
oh,
there's a lot of people that were super 

1918
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:58,150
happy,
that's for sure.

1919
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:58,550
Yeah.
I feel like everyone was was either like

1920
01:19:58,551 --> 01:20:03,551
burning bridges or coming out to their 
Friends in a way of like friends and 

1921
01:20:03,551 --> 01:20:06,020
family as trump supporters because there
are a lot of people that were scared.

1922
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,100
Yeah.
Well I think

1923
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:13,100
that he represents a lot of very 
dangerous things and he in a lot of 

1924
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:16,470
people's eyes,
this is the death of responsibility.

1925
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:21,620
He can get away with more things and 
then also these all the different 

1926
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:26,300
business ties and different 
entanglements and all the different 

1927
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:29,871
things and and also just the way he 
communicates that like people don't feel

1928
01:20:30,781 --> 01:20:35,781
like it's statesmen lee and it's not.
It's not representative of what they 

1929
01:20:35,781 --> 01:20:37,860
would like to think of as someone who is
the president of the United States.

1930
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:41,430
They want to think about someone who's 
incredibly noble and well spoken and the

1931
01:20:41,431 --> 01:20:43,650
best representative that we can have,
you know,

1932
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:46,380
like,
forget about obama's policies.

1933
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:49,110
Okay.
Just forget just him as a human being,

1934
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:54,111
standing in front of that podium,
talking as the president was a joy in 

1935
01:20:54,111 --> 01:20:57,870
that.
He was very measured and very calm and I

1936
01:20:57,871 --> 01:21:02,871
think that he is also very articulate 
and very well educated in that thing 

1937
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:05,820
that he represented when he was up there
at that thing.

1938
01:21:05,821 --> 01:21:09,030
The president don,
that figurehead that he represented,

1939
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:14,390
he did such an amazing job of 
representing that because he was 

1940
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,820
exceptioNal.
He's an exceptional man.

1941
01:21:14,821 --> 01:21:18,000
He's exceptionally smart.
He's exceptionally well read.

1942
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:23,001
He's,
the way he communicates is smooth and 

1943
01:21:23,001 --> 01:21:24,660
even the way he's responded to criticism
was very well measured,

1944
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:25,410
you know.
So I,

1945
01:21:25,411 --> 01:21:30,411
I though he did fuck up when he was 
joking aRound about trump back in the 

1946
01:21:30,411 --> 01:21:30,411
day,
you know,

1947
01:21:30,411 --> 01:21:33,420
like he was like,
we was joking about trump's criticism of

1948
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:34,620
him.
But uh,

1949
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:39,621
you know what,
I'm one thing that you'll never be the 

1950
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:39,621
president.

1951
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:40,360
Dope.
So I agree.

1952
01:21:40,361 --> 01:21:43,690
I agree with what you said about like,
I think he's going to be one of the most

1953
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,760
well spoken presidents of my lifetime.
Yeah.

1954
01:21:45,761 --> 01:21:47,860
Well received.
But after the fact,

1955
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,600
there's going to be a lot of people that
look at that and go,

1956
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,790
yes.
But it was all phony.

1957
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:55,180
It was all,
it was all an act from trump.

1958
01:21:55,270 --> 01:22:00,270
Trump may speak six syllables at a time 
and break and then go on tangents.

1959
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,310
Thanks.
Hey,

1960
01:22:03,311 --> 01:22:06,920
it's in the bubble bad thing.
It's in the bubble of that arm brace.

1961
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:08,970
But,
uh,

1962
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,220
I feel like there are people that go,
you know,

1963
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:14,860
he's not the best speaker in the world,
but he's more real.

1964
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,090
Right?
So there's gonna be that argument.

1965
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:18,860
I 100 percent agree with you about obama
as far as like the,

1966
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:23,870
the office and the nobility.
But they're going to be people that say 

1967
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:23,870
it's just,
it's just bullshit.

1968
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:23,870
That's why we needed something 
different.

1969
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:25,060
Maybe.
But you know,

1970
01:22:25,061 --> 01:22:30,061
there's other,
there's other people that look at the 

1971
01:22:30,061 --> 01:22:32,551
whole thing and they say this is a well 
needed break from the system that,

1972
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:34,980
you know,
there's things,

1973
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:40,020
a big test.
It's a test of our system that have been

1974
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:46,050
controlling the system.
People that were deeply entrenched in 

1975
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:49,351
the left and deeply entrenched in the 
ride for so long that he's the first 

1976
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:52,870
businessmen that has been.
He's been a participant in our system.

1977
01:22:53,621 --> 01:22:58,621
He's been essentially paying these guys 
off for years and years and now here he 

1978
01:22:58,621 --> 01:23:00,430
is like,
like he talked pretty openly,

1979
01:23:00,431 --> 01:23:05,431
which I thought was hilarious about 
hillary and bill coming to his wedding 

1980
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:05,980
and

1981
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,930
that the reason why they did is because 
he paid them,

1982
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:09,340
you know?
I mean,

1983
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:12,160
he paid them,
I think it was more than $100,000

1984
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:13,810
for them to come to his wedding.
Oh wow.

1985
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:16,450
yeah.
That's just how they do things.

1986
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,560
Do you mean like,
do you think he literally paid them 

1987
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:21,850
where he gave them a donation and then 
there were like donation.

1988
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:26,851
I mean,
let's be real about what the clinton 

1989
01:23:26,851 --> 01:23:26,851
foundation is.
Whether or not it did good work.

1990
01:23:26,851 --> 01:23:30,560
It's a goddamn pay to play operation and
one of the things they got besides the 

1991
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,291
donations,
which I'm sure did go to charitable 

1992
01:23:34,291 --> 01:23:36,301
causes,
they got paid to speak and they didn't 

1993
01:23:36,301 --> 01:23:38,881
just get paid to speak a little.
They got paid to speak hundreds of 

1994
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:39,850
thousands of dollars and they did it 
over and over and over again.

1995
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:42,250
Both bill and hillary and there's a 
reason why,

1996
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,460
just for the same reason why trump 
release his taxes,

1997
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:50,610
hillary won't release the transcripts of
those speeches that she gave to the 

1998
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:51,160
banks because they would be horrific.

1999
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,080
If they weren't horrific,
she would release them.

2000
01:23:53,081 --> 01:23:54,370
It'd be really simple.
No,

2001
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:58,180
I said some great things about income 
equality and how we all need to,

2002
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:00,730
you know,
support the impoverished communities.

2003
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:05,760
Fuck you.
You dId because did you had released 

2004
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:05,760
that and everybody would go,
oh,

2005
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,540
even though hillary is worth millions 
dollars,

2006
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,890
she's super fair.
She's reasonable.

2007
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:10,140
No,
there was none of that.

2008
01:24:10,141 --> 01:24:13,360
The reason there's a reason,
it's a corrupt system,

2009
01:24:13,361 --> 01:24:18,361
man.
It's a system that they figured out how 

2010
01:24:18,361 --> 01:24:20,401
to find loopholes and they've created 
legislation over the years that have 

2011
01:24:20,401 --> 01:24:23,851
allowed them to skirt through these 
weird sort of fucking avenues of,

2012
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,400
of legality,
and they get to this point where they're

2013
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:30,430
making insane amounts of money as a 
public servant.

2014
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:35,670
I meaN,
bill clinton and hillary clinton have 

2015
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,621
earned hundreds of fucking of millions 
of dollars and doing what?

2016
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:40,720
Do you have a business?
Are you selling laptops?

2017
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:41,430
What are you doing?
You,

2018
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:46,440
you have a new car to you're selling.
Where are you making all thiS fucking 

2019
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:46,440
money?
Oh,

2020
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,501
just talking how weird.
You're making hundreds of millions of 

2021
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,460
dollars talking when you used to be the 
president who's paying you?

2022
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,870
Oh,
this is weird.

2023
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,960
THe people that are paying you are the 
people that benefited from you being in 

2024
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:57,960
those.
Wait a minute,

2025
01:24:57,970 --> 01:25:02,130
did they pay you off?
Are you stiff?

2026
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:07,970
Right.
But that's the argument and that's what 

2027
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:07,970
it is.
And that's the drain.

2028
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:07,970
The swamp shit.
I mean,

2029
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:10,270
that's where it came from.
So donald trump's not guilty of that.

2030
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:16,370
So that sort of thing,
that thing that he's not guilty of 

2031
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:19,291
getting paid hundreds of millions of 
dollars to talk and to give his 

2032
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:23,170
influence as a,
as a person who's serving,

2033
01:25:23,171 --> 01:25:26,410
whether it's the senate or someone who's
a president that's not while he's.

2034
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:27,790
While he's getting that money.
So he's.

2035
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:30,630
He's corrupt in a totally different way.
Yeah.

2036
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:32,260
He's a,
he's a,

2037
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,000
he's a special one because it's special 
one.

2038
01:25:34,001 --> 01:25:35,800
I don't know.
I get it.

2039
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:38,860
I get it.
I get exhausted about it and I hate even

2040
01:25:38,861 --> 01:25:40,450
talking about it.
People were mad at right now.

2041
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:41,920
Are they,
are they hitting you?

2042
01:25:41,921 --> 01:25:44,600
I'm sure they are just imagining rogan.
No.

2043
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:46,570
IF you don't know anything about 
politics,

2044
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:51,571
which the right.
I should probably shut the fuck up by 

2045
01:25:51,571 --> 01:25:51,610
learning more and then get more upset 
and then talk more.

2046
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:56,700
I used to joke about.
I mean I still do it from time to time 

2047
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,921
that I would want to be president,
but when you see these dudes become 

2048
01:25:58,921 --> 01:25:58,921
president,
they look,

2049
01:25:58,921 --> 01:26:03,271
they look like they like one month in,
they look like they're in a race they 

2050
01:26:03,271 --> 01:26:06,871
didn't train for.
Somebody should have a picture of trump 

2051
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:09,311
now.
I know he talked to at seapak this 

2052
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:09,410
morning and he was on the prompter is,
but I was just like,

2053
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:12,230
I don't know if it's the white balance 
on this video,

2054
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:12,830
but.

2055
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:13,880
Oh wait,
what's this?

2056
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:17,660
My friend cameron hanes.
Keep hammering five k,

2057
01:26:17,661 --> 01:26:20,750
the only race I've ever run.
I ran a five k asked me many times.

2058
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:24,080
I ran a train for it.
Seven zero.

2059
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,710
I thought it would be zero,
but I thought we're going to fuck with.

2060
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,400
I ran the rate.
I didn't trade at all,

2061
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,250
so that's the same thing.
She caught me at the end of that race.

2062
01:26:31,251 --> 01:26:31,880
I was like,
whoa,

2063
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,430
that's hard to do if you'd like to here 
in shape.

2064
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:39,440
So a lot longer than.
I thought it was more difficult to run 

2065
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:43,091
five k than it seems.
It seems like I've worked out all the 

2066
01:26:43,091 --> 01:26:43,091
time.
This is for pussies,

2067
01:26:43,091 --> 01:26:46,661
so I'll just go run it now.
I think if you think that you could be 

2068
01:26:46,661 --> 01:26:46,680
the prentice,
the president,

2069
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:49,910
like I have amazing stamina.
I have a winning mentality,

2070
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:52,010
a winning temperament,
you know,

2071
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:53,480
like once you get in there,
man,

2072
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,890
that guy looks bewildered.

2073
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:59,890
THat press conference that he did the 
other day where he's just going on and 

2074
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:00,440
on about everything.
Holy shit.

2075
01:27:00,441 --> 01:27:02,690
That was terrifying to me,
but I had friends that are conservatives

2076
01:27:02,691 --> 01:27:04,640
at texted me afterwards go,
he looks unstable.

2077
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:05,940
This is making me nervous.
Like,

2078
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:07,070
wow,
there you go.

2079
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:12,100
Well,
because you're making America great 

2080
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:12,100
again.
You fucks.

2081
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:12,100
Kellyanne conway hasn't been on tv for 
awhile,

2082
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:12,100
but what?
Like some of the last one,

2083
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,900
she was just looked like she was 
wrecked.

2084
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:18,970
They got her in a bunker somewhere.
They're feeding her adderall and the 

2085
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:18,970
tone of what to say.
She's just like,

2086
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:19,450
I don't know if I could do this.
I would.

2087
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:24,510
I would.
I would probably collapse under it all 

2088
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:24,510
for sure.
I would call out.

2089
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:28,401
I would.
I would decide everything on fucking 

2090
01:27:28,401 --> 01:27:28,401
internet polls.
Like you fucking run this thing too.

2091
01:27:28,401 --> 01:27:30,320
I first of all,
I'd be drunk on tv all the time.

2092
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:34,070
I'd be smoking weed,
but like we got to do is burn down.

2093
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:39,670
The whole system broke down.
It would be like when they found marlin 

2094
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:40,280
brando and apocalypse now and the 
desert,

2095
01:27:40,281 --> 01:27:42,450
he's talking about the snail going 
across the razor blade,

2096
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:51,600
razor blade.
I feel like it's really right now with 

2097
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:51,600
everyone that's involved in it.
It's a.

2098
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,070
It's a test of endurance.
Oh yeah.

2099
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,920
Right.
It's who is going to last the longest.

2100
01:27:54,921 --> 01:27:55,740
Who's gonna?
Who's gonna?

2101
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,440
KEep on fighting.
It's shaking.

2102
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:02,670
You know,
we're having an earthquake and the 

2103
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:02,670
earthquake is going to fuck up.
All those shitty buildings.

2104
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:05,120
All the ones without the strong 
foundation.

2105
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:06,800
They're gonna.
They're gonna be brecht,

2106
01:28:06,801 --> 01:28:11,801
and we're going to have to condemn them 
and tear them down and start fresh and 

2107
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,710
see.
I don't like it.

2108
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:19,400
I don't like how this has gone.
I would have hoped that we got a savior.

2109
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:22,700
I would've hoped that someone stepped in
that was a really reasonable person,

2110
01:28:22,701 --> 01:28:25,160
but I don't think a reasonable person 
even could get traction.

2111
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:30,370
I think our system is so fucked up that 
we almost might benefit from some crazy 

2112
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:32,660
ass hole coming in here and doing what 
he's doing.

2113
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:38,060
I don't think you'd get a normal person 
who one wants to be president and then 

2114
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,200
gets propped up by all the people that 
are already in empower.

2115
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,750
You don't get that.
That person couldn't agree more.

2116
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:42,320
Right?
It's like,

2117
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,700
oh,
this person has baggage.

2118
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,950
Everyone at that fucking point has to 
have baggage,

2119
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:51,250
which is one of the things about obama 
is that he was so measured and you know,

2120
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,980
wasn't vindictive and what I mean,
maybe behind the scenes you killed a few

2121
01:28:54,981 --> 01:28:56,360
people.
I mean,

2122
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:57,830
when you say few people,
people will go,

2123
01:28:57,831 --> 01:28:58,940
well,
what about drones though?

2124
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:01,470
Oh yeah,
I was exactly thinking that.

2125
01:29:01,471 --> 01:29:06,471
Yeah,
I mean he certainly is responsible for 

2126
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:08,181
that.
They killed something like 80 percent 

2127
01:29:08,181 --> 01:29:09,380
civilians.
Was it 10 percent of entire populations?

2128
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:10,000
I was like,
what?

2129
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:15,140
I think that was the most recent 
statistic finding innocent deaths by 

2130
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:17,130
drone,
by percentage.

2131
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,860
I really think it was.
It's super high.

2132
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:22,050
Scary high.
Even you saying that sentence,

2133
01:29:22,051 --> 01:29:24,090
it's horrifying,
but that statistic exists,

2134
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:24,780
right?
It's like,

2135
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:26,880
hey,
can we just google a horror?

2136
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:32,210
Google,
google horrific things happening right 

2137
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:32,210
now,
just weDding parties,

2138
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,610
just hellfire missiles on wedding.
That's the internet right now.

2139
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:40,650
It's us,
everyone yelling about politics and 

2140
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:40,650
cats.
What do you got,

2141
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:40,860
jamie?
Would you say the top one that popped up

2142
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:45,920
with nearly 90 percent of people killed 
in recent drone strikes were not the 

2143
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,040
target.
Fuck jesus.

2144
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:50,400
But guys,
they fixed it.

2145
01:29:50,401 --> 01:29:55,401
They fixed it from them.
My fucking head hurts and on the 

2146
01:29:55,401 --> 01:29:55,440
huffington post put this article out and
everyone was like,

2147
01:29:55,441 --> 01:29:56,250
you know what,
let's chill.

2148
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:01,560
And then the world was happy.
My fucking head hurts when you read 

2149
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:01,560
things like that.

2150
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,040
Yeah.
I mean we live in,

2151
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,130
I mean things are a bit chaotic or are 
chaotic now,

2152
01:30:05,131 --> 01:30:06,960
but we live in disneyland compared to

2153
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:10,300
world and I think that's important for 
people to remember for sure.

2154
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:13,940
But the problem is those people that are
over there in non disney land,

2155
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,030
they're just like you or are they just 
kinda shitty?

2156
01:30:16,031 --> 01:30:21,031
Roll the dice.
That's what's fucked and that's what's 

2157
01:30:21,031 --> 01:30:21,050
fucked up about this whole refugee 
thing.

2158
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,830
This idea that somehow or another,
if someone's a muslim,

2159
01:30:23,831 --> 01:30:25,390
you can keep them from coming into this 
country.

2160
01:30:25,391 --> 01:30:26,470
Like,
man,

2161
01:30:26,471 --> 01:30:28,570
I know a lot of muslims and they're nice
people.

2162
01:30:28,571 --> 01:30:31,240
Like you can't,
like just because someone believes wacky

2163
01:30:31,241 --> 01:30:32,110
shit.
okay.

2164
01:30:32,111 --> 01:30:34,960
Whether they're mooneys or whether 
they're mormons with.

2165
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,230
I know some really nice mormons.
They're fucking great people.

2166
01:30:38,231 --> 01:30:39,550
If you said,
should you get rid of them?

2167
01:30:39,551 --> 01:30:40,840
I said,
no,

2168
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:46,020
you don't listen to them.
You don't really get a planet when you 

2169
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:49,051
die.
You don't have to wear the magic 

2170
01:30:49,051 --> 01:30:49,051
underwear,
But they're nice folks.

2171
01:30:49,051 --> 01:30:50,390
I know people that believe nutty shit.
One of my best friends believes that the

2172
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,290
the fucking government is spraying 
things out of the back of planes.

2173
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:55,960
When you see those contracts in the sky,
he thinks it's like,

2174
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,960
what does he call this strategic aerosol
injection leads?

2175
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:00,760
It's an ssi program.
Like,

2176
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,260
no,
it's not.

2177
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:03,950
you know,
it's,

2178
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:08,980
it's,
there's a lot of people that believe 

2179
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:09,670
some ridiculous shit and they need the 
opportunity just like all of us do,

2180
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:14,820
to have peace and prosperity and to have
the opportunities you take in more 

2181
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,890
information that may make you reconsider
your beliefs.

2182
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:22,100
Yeah.
I feel like when it comes to the 

2183
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:22,100
immigration thing,
there's people on two fronts,

2184
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,561
right?
There's one as far as general 

2185
01:31:25,561 --> 01:31:28,171
immigration people coming through 
legally from countries and then there's 

2186
01:31:28,171 --> 01:31:29,020
also the refugee program,
right?

2187
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:32,410
And so what I've seen is a lot of 
arguments of,

2188
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:34,070
okay,
so you're saying that you know,

2189
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:39,080
these people are displaced,
they're having to go through all these 

2190
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:39,080
horrible things.
People are saYing,

2191
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:44,220
why is that my problem is because 
America is the land of dreams and we 

2192
01:31:44,471 --> 01:31:47,860
should offer that because we're great.
Why should that?

2193
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:49,990
And then once again,
not my argument,

2194
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:53,980
but why is that taking precedent over 
me?

2195
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:54,760
Who's,
who's,

2196
01:31:54,761 --> 01:31:55,960
you know,
I went to college,

2197
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:58,630
things haven't worked out.
My life's fucking in shambles.

2198
01:31:58,690 --> 01:32:03,690
I have yelling that I have white 
privilege all the time and the fucking 

2199
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:05,410
seems like the world's more and more 
against me every day.

2200
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:06,640
Why?
If,

2201
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,490
if and in their heads like all these 
people are at risk.

2202
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,270
Let me stop right there for that guy.
I got three words.

2203
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:18,730
What's a fuck yourself?
And then form words,

2204
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:23,790
suck it up.
Pussy jesus christ you.

2205
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:25,020
Oh,
you can be.

2206
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:27,640
We'll call you have white privilege.
You freaking out,

2207
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:29,140
you're in America,
bitch.

2208
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:32,590
If if things aren't going well,
work harder,

2209
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:35,500
figuring it out,
you're a white guy in America,

2210
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:39,730
you're so lucky you finding shit to 
complain about,

2211
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,430
but so everybody has their own hand that
they're dealt,

2212
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:47,431
right,
and some people are in impoverished 

2213
01:32:47,431 --> 01:32:49,141
fucking coal miner communities in West 
Virginia and some people are born in 

2214
01:32:49,141 --> 01:32:49,990
marin county with a silver spoon in 
their mouth.

2215
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:51,760
GraNted we are.
We're all aware of that,

2216
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:57,030
but if you don't think that your 
opportunities are far greater because 

2217
01:32:57,030 --> 01:33:00,511
you live in american and are.
If you're a syrian refugee coming over 

2218
01:33:00,511 --> 01:33:00,640
here,
wrapped up in a fucking tent,

2219
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:01,960
you're crazy.

2220
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:07,140
You're crazy.
And one of the things that makes this 

2221
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:08,470
place so fucking special is that it's 
the land of opportunity.

2222
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:11,740
As soon as you stop having it be the 
land of opportunity,

2223
01:33:11,741 --> 01:33:16,741
you stopped taking in those new people.
You stopped giving those people that 

2224
01:33:16,741 --> 01:33:17,710
opportunity and then you make this place
a different thing.

2225
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,160
You make this place.
This is this secluded,

2226
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:22,900
isolated.
You know,

2227
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:24,880
put the fence up,
put the wall up.

2228
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:28,240
Everybody in is in.
Everybody else could go fuck themselves.

2229
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:31,720
that's not what it is,
that you're changing what it is.

2230
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:36,870
This is the land of opportunity.
This is a country that was founded 

2231
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:38,110
entirely by immigrants who killed the 
natives,

2232
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:41,200
but that that's.
That's what we are.

2233
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:43,960
You know,
there's.

2234
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
There's certainly good and bad to all 
forms of immigration and there's 

2235
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,740
certainly good and bad to cultural 
integration.

2236
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:53,050
Cultural integration is where things get
really problematic,

2237
01:33:53,051 --> 01:33:56,860
especially for women,
for women and women that have dealt with

2238
01:33:56,861 --> 01:34:00,850
all the horrific situations that have 
happened in all these european countries

2239
01:34:00,851 --> 01:34:05,851
where muslims have come in and the 
radical ones have wanted to enforce 

2240
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:09,430
their ideas,
the sharia law ideas on the women in the

2241
01:34:09,431 --> 01:34:11,190
area and they see women walking around 
me,

2242
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:14,080
skirts and all that stuff is a real 
problem.

2243
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:19,110
The Integration of cultural norms and 
values into a western society that has 

2244
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:23,170
just a completely different idea of 
what's acceptable and not acceptable.

2245
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:26,050
That's going to take some time and if I 
was in that area,

2246
01:34:26,051 --> 01:34:28,900
I get the fuck out of dodge.
I would not want to be around.

2247
01:34:28,901 --> 01:34:33,901
If there's a culture war going on,
what people are fighting and arguing 

2248
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:34,690
over ideas that may or may not include 
your wife,

2249
01:34:34,691 --> 01:34:35,770
your daughter,
your mother,

2250
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:37,000
that's too dangerous.

2251
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,840
Then you'd have a lot of those same 
people that I talk about saying,

2252
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:44,841
well,
why the fuck should I have to move 

2253
01:34:44,841 --> 01:34:44,841
because we're this thing.

2254
01:34:44,841 --> 01:34:46,810
you can't let that happen in America.
That's a different thing,

2255
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:49,570
but that's the problem.
You cannot let that happen in America.

2256
01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:54,571
If you get people that are coming,
you have to have a no tolerance policy 

2257
01:34:54,571 --> 01:34:57,511
to anyone that's giving anyone a hard 
time over accepted values in America.

2258
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:01,340
Like the way women are allowed to dress 
or driving cars.

2259
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:06,341
What if you come over from Saudi Arabia 
and you want to kill all the women that 

2260
01:35:06,341 --> 01:35:06,341
are driving cars?
You know like what if you would,

2261
01:35:06,341 --> 01:35:10,930
if you want to impart sharia law and on 
women that are committing adultery or 

2262
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:13,040
doing any of the things that are just 
really.

2263
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:17,360
There's no law against a girl decided to
fuck 100 guys in America.

2264
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:19,880
If a girl decides to rent out a 
warehouse and go,

2265
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:20,540
hey,
you know,

2266
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:22,340
first a hundred guys get the fuck man,
come on in.

2267
01:35:22,690 --> 01:35:27,690
Like in another country,
like you can be put to death for that 

2268
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:28,610
and that there are women that are 
arrested that are sexually assaulted.

2269
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,970
Yes.
Like when you look at what sucks is it's

2270
01:35:31,971 --> 01:35:36,971
not like that was one story.
There's so many stories over the years 

2271
01:35:36,971 --> 01:35:37,190
and it's fucking.
It's horrifying,

2272
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:42,220
but so that's why I then argued because 
even to the point that you're saying 

2273
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:42,380
there are people that are scared of 
that,

2274
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:47,390
but there has to be some sort of a zero 
tolerance policy for subjecting other 

2275
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:49,460
people to your ideas and beliefs in that
way,

2276
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:52,880
but it also,
every culture evolves.

2277
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:56,870
Mean christians used to be a part of the
inquisition.

2278
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:59,360
I mean that Was,
they were torturing people and they were

2279
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:04,390
there getting people to confess to 
horrific crimes and they never really 

2280
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:08,021
did.
They did all sorts of things to people 

2281
01:36:08,021 --> 01:36:09,800
that were nonbelievers and that was a 
normal part of life in some parts of the

2282
01:36:09,801 --> 01:36:11,070
world a long time ago.
Right.

2283
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:16,390
We have to assume that that kind of 
progress is not just isolated to 

2284
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:16,390
christians.

2285
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:20,450
It's not just something that one belief 
system can,

2286
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:23,420
can sort of embodied that sort of 
evolution,

2287
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:28,720
that this can be something that we 
experienced in a lot of different 

2288
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,870
mindsets,
a lot of different ideologies,

2289
01:36:29,871 --> 01:36:34,871
and then the opportunity to educate 
those people in a place where they're 

2290
01:36:34,871 --> 01:36:37,730
free might be the only way that's ever 
going to change when the echo chamber of

2291
01:36:37,731 --> 01:36:41,510
the middle east where these people are 
growing up in these and obviously you're

2292
01:36:41,511 --> 01:36:44,270
talking about places with very few 
resources,

2293
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:47,000
really dangerous environments for 
everyone.

2294
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:52,020
YOu know,
if you're living in these incredibly 

2295
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:52,020
impoverished middle eastern places where
these people were freeing.

2296
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,530
I mean if you are fleeing,
I mean you've seen the videos of aleppo,

2297
01:36:54,531 --> 01:36:56,360
you've seen the stuff of the news.
I mean it's.

2298
01:36:57,390 --> 01:37:02,390
Anything's better than that.
Anything's better than being in a a 

2299
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:05,231
bombs zone where things are just going 
off left and right and suicide bombings 

2300
01:37:05,231 --> 01:37:09,221
and missiles and chaos and death and 
isis throwing people off the roof for 

2301
01:37:09,221 --> 01:37:09,380
being gay.

2302
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:10,880
I mean,
it's just horrific.

2303
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:14,930
So those people that are living in that,
it's almost like their life.

2304
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,140
It can't get any worse.
Right?

2305
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:22,310
They are in hell.
They literally in an apocalypse right 

2306
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:22,310
now.
If you look at a mel gibson movie look,

2307
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:26,961
get any kind of crazy mad max movie.
How is that any different than Syria 

2308
01:37:26,961 --> 01:37:27,650
right now?
I mean it's really not.

2309
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:32,770
It's just we know that one of the 
reasons why we don't consider this the 

2310
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:36,410
apocalypse right now because it's not 
the apocalypse here in woodland hills,

2311
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:37,140
right?
You know,

2312
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:42,640
but it's the apocalypse in Syria,
it's the apocalypse and there's pockets 

2313
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:47,410
of the world where things are absolutely
horrific and those areas were scared.

2314
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,100
Those areas going to come here and make 
us the apocalypse to.

2315
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:57,460
Yeah.
But I mean it goes back to the 

2316
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:57,460
disneyland thing where it is it 
disneyland and where

2317
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:00,980
were really pissed that some of the 
rides are closed than where we're in 

2318
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:01,050
line and we feel like other people are 
getting ahead,

2319
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:05,010
but it's not.
It's not that it is not,

2320
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:07,800
it doesn't compare.
But I have,

2321
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:09,030
I have a bleeding heart in,
in,

2322
01:38:09,031 --> 01:38:14,031
in some capacity is when,
when you see those things and you're 

2323
01:38:14,031 --> 01:38:14,031
like,
we have to help whoever we have to help,

2324
01:38:14,031 --> 01:38:17,160
but my goal is to always understand the 
guy that doesn't want to have to fucking

2325
01:38:17,161 --> 01:38:19,920
move out of his neighborhood because all
these,

2326
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:22,710
all these people came in and the culture
changed,

2327
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:27,760
right?
It's just tAking into account his 

2328
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:27,760
mindset where you're.
I mean even you said,

2329
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,380
all of a sudden you're worried about 
your daughter,

2330
01:38:28,381 --> 01:38:33,381
your wife,
that there are people that have that 

2331
01:38:33,381 --> 01:38:33,381
mindset.
And,

2332
01:38:33,381 --> 01:38:33,381
and I mean,
and we're human beings.

2333
01:38:33,381 --> 01:38:36,690
It's the easiest thing in the world to 
create an us versus them argument,

2334
01:38:36,691 --> 01:38:39,030
especially if there's fear onto my 
family.

2335
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:41,680
I mean,
if you're anyone that's a,

2336
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:43,500
you have,
you have fear for yourself,

2337
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:45,210
but anytime all of a sudden you have a 
family,

2338
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:48,260
it's next level will also.
I tHink people were worried about people

2339
01:38:48,261 --> 01:38:53,261
coming over here and not integrating and
then coming over here and then they 

2340
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:57,101
start these communities where they all 
use the same language and they all use 

2341
01:38:57,101 --> 01:38:57,101
the same.
YOu know,

2342
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:02,330
the same written language on their signs
and then they develop these like 

2343
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:04,190
chinatown titan neighborhoods.
Not disparaging chinatown in any way,

2344
01:39:04,191 --> 01:39:07,190
but that just as an example of ethnic 
communities,

2345
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,550
it's sort of stay isolated,
right?

2346
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:11,510
Like there's places in chinatown where 
you go and no one's speaking english,

2347
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:14,330
they'll just running around speaking 
chinese and they can't speak english,

2348
01:39:14,331 --> 01:39:15,780
but they figured out a way to integrate.
THere's,

2349
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:18,410
there's also latino communities in this 
country that are like,

2350
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:22,790
that's similarly as well and I think 
people are worried about that,

2351
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:27,791
like that spreading and they say that 
that has actually happened in parts of 

2352
01:39:27,791 --> 01:39:30,761
paris and it's happened in parts of 
Germany where these people have come 

2353
01:39:30,761 --> 01:39:34,031
over from other countries as refugees 
and they've established communities and 

2354
01:39:34,031 --> 01:39:37,481
then they enforce their laws and that 
was something that my low was going to 

2355
01:39:37,551 --> 01:39:38,000
do.

2356
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:43,130
He was going to do some sort oF a march 
and he was going to do like some,

2357
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:47,600
a gay march through,
I think it was Sweden.

2358
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:53,040
I think it was going to go through like 
the worst muslim neighborhoods and 

2359
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,431
Sweden,
but they just decided it was far too 

2360
01:39:56,431 --> 01:39:56,520
sweet and trips so much promo on a 
sweetened promo.

2361
01:39:57,530 --> 01:39:58,490
They're in denial.
They're like,

2362
01:39:58,491 --> 01:39:59,600
no,
we're fine.

2363
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:00,680
Hey,
we haven't done anything.

2364
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:05,800
And then right afTer they said that some
horrific outbreak took place by the way,

2365
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:11,890
it's got a little violence going on 
there and now that you didn't use to 

2366
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:11,890
have.
Right?

2367
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:11,960
Right.
But this is growing pains.

2368
01:40:11,961 --> 01:40:16,961
Like if you take people from a violent 
place and then you let them loose and 

2369
01:40:16,961 --> 01:40:21,450
like there was this one horrific story 
about this guy from Iraq that came over 

2370
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:27,041
some,
some refugee and he raped some boy in 

2371
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:29,861
Germany and his response where they 
asked him why he did it was like I 

2372
01:40:29,861 --> 01:40:32,450
hadn't seen my wife and six months and I
was having a sexual emergency.

2373
01:40:33,010 --> 01:40:34,970
Yeah.
SO it'll be like what?

2374
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:37,260
Like there's things.
Actually,

2375
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:39,260
I don't think it was from Iraq,
I think it was from Afghanistan,

2376
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:42,290
but there's,
there's things that go on in other parts

2377
01:40:42,291 --> 01:40:46,700
of the world that become.
I don't want to say the norm,

2378
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:50,390
but they do happen there.
Well that they don't happen.

2379
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,120
That's where I think it's important that
in general,

2380
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,290
people don't have the time where it's 
important to,

2381
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:57,910
to be as educated as possible because if
we're,

2382
01:40:57,911 --> 01:41:02,911
if we're basing things off of the way 
things are generally becoming or it 

2383
01:41:02,911 --> 01:41:03,850
seems like more and more.
Yes.

2384
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:05,860
But if yOu're basing stuff off of 
outliers,

2385
01:41:06,090 --> 01:41:07,780
um,
I think that's where,

2386
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:09,780
that's where things are crazy.
Were you here?

2387
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:11,050
Um,
you know,

2388
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:16,110
someone that was here illegally,
they keep talking about the same story 

2389
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:16,110
over and over.
It was like,

2390
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:17,350
it was a someone who are illegally.
There was a murder.

2391
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:22,650
Right.
And it's like the same story and I want 

2392
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:22,650
to see,
I want to see the bigger picture because

2393
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:23,200
yes,
that's fucking horrifying and a bubble.

2394
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:25,570
But what's the,
what's the big thing?

2395
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,550
If it leans more towards,
holy shit,

2396
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:29,410
this is scary then.
Yeah.

2397
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,730
But if you base something off of like 
with guns,

2398
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:38,820
right?
If you base something off of one 

2399
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:40,801
specific shooting,
that is like if you look at the body 

2400
01:41:40,801 --> 01:41:43,771
count,
the guns involved specifically if it's 

2401
01:41:43,771 --> 01:41:43,771
an outlier,
if it's.

2402
01:41:43,771 --> 01:41:45,100
If it's representative of a biGger 
problem,

2403
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:47,260
then if you really go after the bigger 
problem,

2404
01:41:47,261 --> 01:41:52,261
if you actually want to have an effect,
it's not just superficial or that's not 

2405
01:41:52,261 --> 01:41:52,261
just a big stance,

2406
01:41:52,261 --> 01:41:56,800
well,
we all want to be safe and we all want 

2407
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,811
our loved ones safe and so do they mean 
that's what I think is really important 

2408
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:01,280
and when they don't anymore,
when,

2409
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:04,370
when when people don't want to be safe 
or they don't want their loved one safe,

2410
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,290
then we have to figure out why.
Like what?

2411
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:09,260
What'S going on that you're willing to 
strap your kid full of dynamite and have

2412
01:42:09,261 --> 01:42:14,261
him walk into a mall and blow people up 
like and now you think he's a holy 

2413
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:18,161
martyr.
I remember watching some documentary on 

2414
01:42:18,161 --> 01:42:21,131
suicide bombings and they were raising 
these children to be suicide bombings 

2415
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:21,131
and they had these pictures of these 
kids,

2416
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:24,440
these holy images of these children with
suicide vests on,

2417
01:42:24,441 --> 01:42:26,480
on the wall that had already committed 
suicide.

2418
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:29,900
And there was a sign in islamic that 
said,

2419
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:34,990
uh,
today's actually islamic's not a 

2420
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:34,990
language.

2421
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:35,100
When I talked to her mom,
I was like,

2422
01:42:35,101 --> 01:42:36,050
oh yeah,
go with it.

2423
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:37,520
Yeah.
Well in arabic,

2424
01:42:37,521 --> 01:42:42,521
excuse me.
But it said today's children are 

2425
01:42:42,521 --> 01:42:45,551
tomorrow's holy martyrs.
And that was on the wall and they were 

2426
01:42:45,551 --> 01:42:49,001
interviewing these people and trying to 
wrap their head around this and make 

2427
01:42:49,001 --> 01:42:49,001
sense of it.
You know,

2428
01:42:49,001 --> 01:42:53,350
when you've got situations like that,
everyone should be scared because then 

2429
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:54,950
people embrace their ideology to the 
point where they're willing to let their

2430
01:42:54,951 --> 01:42:59,951
own babies blow themselves up in k so 
you've got a real problem there and 

2431
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:02,480
that,
that is as much of a problem as any kind

2432
01:43:02,481 --> 01:43:04,460
of cult,
any kind of mind control,

2433
01:43:04,461 --> 01:43:06,050
any kind of.
And if,

2434
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:07,460
if that's happening over here,
yeah,

2435
01:43:07,461 --> 01:43:07,820
yeah,
yeah.

2436
01:43:07,821 --> 01:43:09,410
That needs to be taken into 
consideration.

2437
01:43:09,411 --> 01:43:13,250
But how many people are doing that?
What is the percentage?

2438
01:43:13,251 --> 01:43:16,700
how many people aren't doing that?
How many people are productive,

2439
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:21,910
kind,
reasonable people that are stuck in a 

2440
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:24,461
really shitty place.
And isn't that supposed to be what 

2441
01:43:24,461 --> 01:43:26,921
America is about?
So you can't just say there's a small 

2442
01:43:26,921 --> 01:43:27,110
percentage of people that are doing 
horrific shit,

2443
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:31,290
so now we can't let anybody that looks 
like them in as that gets crazy and that

2444
01:43:31,291 --> 01:43:33,380
isolates us from the whole rest of the 
world too.

2445
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:38,590
But it ain't easy man and it's not an 
easy problem to solve and I'm certainly 

2446
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:39,530
not the fucking guy to do it.

2447
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,400
right.
Ditto.

2448
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:45,680
Yeah.
Because because the argument 

2449
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:45,680
automatically becomes,
but what if my family right and then

2450
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:47,160
secure people.
How do you make things secure?

2451
01:43:47,161 --> 01:43:48,300
I don't know.
Good question.

2452
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:49,310
Well,
there's a screen.

2453
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:54,320
That thing is saying no,
there's no such thing as safety before 

2454
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:54,320
they were safety.
Right.

2455
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,160
But you can make things more safe.
You can make things somewhat safe.

2456
01:43:55,161 --> 01:43:58,820
But I mean it,
it's a dark thing to think about.

2457
01:43:58,821 --> 01:44:01,940
But before there were even more of these
shootings that happened.

2458
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:07,480
you look at why do you have to.
Why do you have to blow up a plane or 

2459
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:09,170
why do you have to crash a plane if you 
can just get the people in line,

2460
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:10,640
right?
If you go to a mall,

2461
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:12,590
why?
There are people that are just,

2462
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:17,730
they're all soft targets everywhere.
no one's ever going to be fully safe 

2463
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:19,490
unless it's under some crazy,
crazy,

2464
01:44:19,491 --> 01:44:24,491
crazy like big brother control and I 
don't want that either because there'll 

2465
01:44:24,491 --> 01:44:27,290
be consequences for going against big 
brother.

2466
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:28,620
So for me,
when I,

2467
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:31,820
when I talk about these things,
it's just it's a we're fucked,

2468
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:36,821
but in what way are we going to be 
fucked situation and I know that can be 

2469
01:44:36,821 --> 01:44:36,821
a dark.
I know,

2470
01:44:36,821 --> 01:44:39,240
but it is dark.
It's just,

2471
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:44,640
it's disappointing there.
There's no such thing as ultimate 

2472
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:44,640
safety,
right?

2473
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,200
I think I understand the argument of gun
free zones,

2474
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:47,210
great targets.
Their targets everywhere.

2475
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:48,320
Well,
here's the real question.

2476
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:52,020
How do you make the rest of the world?
Like if you,

2477
01:44:52,021 --> 01:44:57,021
if you were some sort of a really 
benevolent person who is just looking to

2478
01:44:58,471 --> 01:45:03,471
do the best,
the best job of managing this world and 

2479
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:10,280
making all the places that are in 
disarray and these horrific war zones 

2480
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:12,600
and bring them up.
How do you.

2481
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:15,870
How do you ever do that?
Like how do you ever even the world out?

2482
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:17,160
No,
it's ever

2483
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:19,100
we need.
We need aliens to come to,

2484
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:24,340
to come and get it.
That's the only time humanity works out 

2485
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:26,650
is when we have a common enemy.
But the problem is we're always our own 

2486
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:26,650
common enemy,

2487
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:27,200
but I will.
But is that inevitable?

2488
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:28,520
I mean,
at one point in time,

2489
01:45:28,521 --> 01:45:29,810
people were way worse,
right?

2490
01:45:29,811 --> 01:45:33,110
At one point in time there was like,
one of the things that really freaked me

2491
01:45:33,111 --> 01:45:38,111
out was when they started finding all 
these scraping marks on the inside of a 

2492
01:45:38,111 --> 01:45:42,810
neanderthal heads that indicated that 
people were eating the neanderthal 

2493
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:42,810
brains.
And I was like,

2494
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:43,400
oh,
jesus.

2495
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:48,610
Like,
and then there was an article recently 

2496
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:50,711
about cannibalism,
about how frequent cannibalism occurred 

2497
01:45:50,711 --> 01:45:51,710
back in the day.
And it was,

2498
01:45:51,711 --> 01:45:52,970
uh,
you know,

2499
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,610
I mean,
obviously that's not going on anymore.

2500
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:56,590
Right?
Okay.

2501
01:45:56,690 --> 01:46:00,010
Is that the bar far less cannibalism 
than ever before?

2502
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:01,380
That's the bar.
We're fucked.

2503
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:02,730
We're like,
we're not eating each other.

2504
01:46:02,731 --> 01:46:03,690
I mean,
say what you will.

2505
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:05,470
We're not eating each other.
Well,

2506
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:09,280
it used to be that you couldn't just 
show up in a new town,

2507
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,270
right?
You couldn't just pull your boat up in,

2508
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:13,000
into,
uh,

2509
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:18,120
some doc somewhere.
And get out and do some tourists 

2510
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:18,520
shopping because if you pulled your boat
up,

2511
01:46:18,521 --> 01:46:23,521
that meant you were probably a bunch of 
rapists and murderers from some other 

2512
01:46:23,521 --> 01:46:26,281
place.
You're comIng over with swords and bows 

2513
01:46:26,281 --> 01:46:26,281
and arrows and shooting everybody and 
killing them.

2514
01:46:26,281 --> 01:46:26,640
Taking all the gold.
Well,

2515
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:31,650
that's not the case anymore,
so things are much more reasonable in 

2516
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:32,680
terms of foreign travel,
in terms of international relations.

2517
01:46:32,681 --> 01:46:37,681
Things are much more reasonable to think
that if it continues to go in that 

2518
01:46:37,681 --> 01:46:41,911
direction,
we'll we'll have a better world for our 

2519
01:46:41,911 --> 01:46:42,580
grandchIldren and our great 
grandchildren,

2520
01:46:42,581 --> 01:46:47,581
but what steps have to be taken to make 
sure that the rest of the world's 

2521
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,400
horrific conditions

2522
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:55,400
don't spill over to America?
Well isn't one of the best ways to take 

2523
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:59,661
those people out of those horrific 
conditions and introduce them to this 

2524
01:46:59,661 --> 01:47:03,480
beautiful free concept is concept of 
self,

2525
01:47:03,481 --> 01:47:04,350
government.
This,

2526
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:09,351
this,
this unique place where there isn't a 

2527
01:47:09,351 --> 01:47:11,310
caste system where you can.
If yOu play your cards right and you,

2528
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:16,380
you're fortunate and you get the right 
brakes and putting the right amount of 

2529
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:20,121
work,
you literally can go from being a poor 

2530
01:47:20,121 --> 01:47:22,461
person to being a very wealthy person.
You can go from being unsuccessful witH 

2531
01:47:22,531 --> 01:47:27,531
no,
no job and no hope to being very 

2532
01:47:27,531 --> 01:47:27,531
successful and happy.
It's.

2533
01:47:27,531 --> 01:47:31,561
It's possible here and it's one of the 
few places in the world when you can 

2534
01:47:31,561 --> 01:47:35,541
build yourself up like that and I think 
that is an amazing opportunity that 

2535
01:47:35,541 --> 01:47:37,500
probably didn't exist in history.

2536
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:40,090
I,
I think I'm too much of a cynic to think

2537
01:47:40,091 --> 01:47:45,091
that the idea of all of us coming 
together on a positive idea will bring 

2538
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:49,561
us altogether.
I 100 percent think it has to be a bad 

2539
01:47:49,561 --> 01:47:50,770
thing that unites us meteor impact or 
some shit.

2540
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:53,770
Meteor impact fake fake that aLiens are 
coming.

2541
01:47:53,771 --> 01:47:56,140
So we all have to come together to make 
everyone fake them.

2542
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:57,470
Well,
aliens,

2543
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:02,480
I want to kill us in like the next 10 
years rather than at some point in the 

2544
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:02,480
eventual time.
I don't think

2545
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,150
the word 10 years is not good because 
people are good.

2546
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:10,130
We'll deal with it.
None at all.

2547
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:12,860
They'll just go fucking crazy though.
The bottom line is,

2548
01:48:12,861 --> 01:48:14,360
bro,
when the aliens get here,

2549
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:18,110
they're going to fucking kill us all.
you're raping while you can.

2550
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:19,550
I think.
I think they're going to be on my side.

2551
01:48:19,551 --> 01:48:21,340
They're going to call you an alien 
apologist.

2552
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:22,520
They'd be like,
oh,

2553
01:48:22,521 --> 01:48:27,521
he's an alien apologist.
He doesn't get joe rogan disconnected 

2554
01:48:27,521 --> 01:48:27,521
from the people.

2555
01:48:27,521 --> 01:48:27,521
Yeah,
man.

2556
01:48:27,521 --> 01:48:30,880
He's up there and his fucking house with
a tv and he doesn't know.

2557
01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:32,410
He doesn't give a shit about those 
aliens.

2558
01:48:32,411 --> 01:48:37,411
He said he did qa drive where he wants 
to go to duke.

2559
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,430
Who is jealous of the internet 
connection because it was in africa.

2560
01:48:43,090 --> 01:48:44,770
Live in a grass hut.
Don't worry.

2561
01:48:44,771 --> 01:48:46,210
Zuckerberg is fixing it.
Has he?

2562
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:48,190
Supposedly right?
Didn't one of those statement.

2563
01:48:48,191 --> 01:48:53,191
Bill gates.
It blew up right there where they're 

2564
01:48:53,191 --> 01:48:53,720
spending a ton of money on a satellite.
It was one of the space that really.

2565
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:54,610
That blew up.
Yeah.

2566
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:58,750
There was supposed to be an nc that the 
one big one that recently blew up was to

2567
01:48:58,751 --> 01:49:02,680
provide satellite internet access to 
impoverished parts of africa.

2568
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:03,620
Yeah,
man,

2569
01:49:03,621 --> 01:49:04,430
I don't know.
I think,

2570
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:07,430
I think the more connected that it is,
it's a good thing,

2571
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,530
but yeah,
it has to be a bad thing.

2572
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:14,550
That has to be a bad thing that unites 
us of where we become the we or the us 

2573
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:16,420
versus them,
the other cars,

2574
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:21,790
but the problem is there is whether it 
be nationalism or religion or fucking 

2575
01:49:21,790 --> 01:49:26,081
anything,
there's so many things that within our 

2576
01:49:26,081 --> 01:49:28,061
own creative creating us an easy us 
versus them mentality and I mean I'm a 

2577
01:49:29,421 --> 01:49:32,030
personal believer in that eventually 
we're just gonna kill it,

2578
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:33,500
kill ourselves.
That's what you think.

2579
01:49:33,530 --> 01:49:34,940
Yeah.
God damn philly,

2580
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:37,220
I think it's just going to happen.
I don't want it to happen.

2581
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:38,460
Let's,
let's,

2582
01:49:38,461 --> 01:49:43,461
let's hurry things up.
It's safer now than it's ever been 

2583
01:49:43,461 --> 01:49:43,461
before.
Statistically speaking,

2584
01:49:43,461 --> 01:49:45,060
today's the safest time ever to be 
alive.

2585
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:48,370
I'm talking about on a grand scale.
I'm not talking as a grand scale.

2586
01:49:48,371 --> 01:49:50,380
when you talk about statistically 
speaking,

2587
01:49:50,381 --> 01:49:55,381
that's the grand scale.
I'm talking about like the next big 

2588
01:49:55,381 --> 01:49:55,381
thing to happen as far as whether it be 
all out war,

2589
01:49:55,381 --> 01:49:56,060
not,
not.

2590
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:58,210
The things that are happening are 
happening in our streets right now.

2591
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:02,140
God damn doom and gloom.
I'm planning for 20,

2592
01:50:02,141 --> 01:50:04,450
24.
It's going to be make birth rate again.

2593
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:07,520
That's going to be mega new.
Um,

2594
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:09,610
how old are you?
I'm 31.

2595
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:12,190
So you were young when nine slash 11 
happened?

2596
01:50:12,191 --> 01:50:13,020
Yes,
I was in.

2597
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,160
I was in my classroom and they like 
wheeled in the tv.

2598
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,640
Oh wow.
What,

2599
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:17,890
what grade were,
do you remember?

2600
01:50:18,610 --> 01:50:21,250
I want to say I was in middle.
No,

2601
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:23,500
I think it might have been my first year
of high school.

2602
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:24,700
I,
I moved around.

2603
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:25,330
I'm trying to think.

2604
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,820
I'm having a hard time placing it,
but I remember I was in class.

2605
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:32,510
I for my memory at the product's problem
with memory is like,

2606
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:34,810
I feel like you've made me slightly 
change it 100 percent,

2607
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:37,570
but from my understanding or my memory,
uh,

2608
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:41,140
they wield the tv and um,
it was after the first tower got hit and

2609
01:50:41,141 --> 01:50:44,110
then I'm pretty sure we watched the 
second tower get hit live.

2610
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:47,470
I think that's what happened.
Wow.

2611
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:52,650
And that was just in my head.
It was a mix of horror a to then also 

2612
01:50:53,531 --> 01:50:58,531
them because they cut to a certain shots
because they're the shots that you 

2613
01:50:58,531 --> 01:50:58,531
remember if people running away from the
debris,

2614
01:50:58,531 --> 01:51:03,451
but then there was also shots with 
people just looking at it and then some 

2615
01:51:03,451 --> 01:51:05,260
people just like walking at a steady 
pace before the second one hit.

2616
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:06,490
And I was like,
wow,

2617
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,500
like nothing for a second.

2618
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:11,230
When I looked at the people that were 
there before the,

2619
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:13,180
You saw like the people running in to 
help people.

2620
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,270
I thought nothing can destroy us.
Like that was,

2621
01:51:16,271 --> 01:51:21,271
that was kind of my mindset of this 
horrible thing just happened and it was 

2622
01:51:21,271 --> 01:51:21,271
before the second one hit.
So it was like,

2623
01:51:21,271 --> 01:51:21,790
what's,
what's happening?

2624
01:51:22,130 --> 01:51:24,140
Um,
but I mean,

2625
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:28,270
I think that's a good example too.
I don't want that to ever happen again.

2626
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:29,000
Uh,
in a,

2627
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:30,610
in a smaller,
a big scale.

2628
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:33,460
But do you remember how united everyone 
was?

2629
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:35,280
that's why I brought it up.
Yeah,

2630
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:36,340
it was,
it was.

2631
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:41,820
The problem is we became,
we somehow took that situation and then 

2632
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,220
made everything horrible.
Um,

2633
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:45,160
but,
but it waS an us,

2634
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:46,420
like we,
there was a,

2635
01:51:46,421 --> 01:51:48,130
there was a united us,
it was,

2636
01:51:48,131 --> 01:51:50,800
it was american,
but it wasn't just the united us,

2637
01:51:50,801 --> 01:51:53,560
it was also the rest of the world was 
sympathetic to our plight.

2638
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:58,610
And there was a headline and some paper 
in paris that said,

2639
01:51:59,311 --> 01:52:02,580
we're all americans today that would 
never happen now.

2640
01:52:03,090 --> 01:52:05,820
Not in a million years.
Have the same exact thing happened.

2641
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:08,220
Would it be they would be like,
you deserve it.

2642
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:11,070
Why are you in,
why you in Afghanistan?

2643
01:52:11,450 --> 01:52:12,750
It wouldn't,
it wouldn't be.

2644
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:16,800
We're all americans because back then we
had invaded Iraq.

2645
01:52:16,801 --> 01:52:19,170
We hadn't invaded Afghanistan and it 
was,

2646
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:22,260
there was so much more sympathy just 16 
years ago.

2647
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:23,420
Well,
even closer to.

2648
01:52:23,421 --> 01:52:24,980
I mean,
when charlie hebdo,

2649
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:25,700
right,
they got hit.

2650
01:52:25,701 --> 01:52:29,420
It was just sweet charlie.
Now when something happens,

2651
01:52:29,421 --> 01:52:29,960
it's like,
well,

2652
01:52:29,961 --> 01:52:31,900
look at what's happening there.
We want more,

2653
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:33,320
we want that here.
Right?

2654
01:52:33,321 --> 01:52:34,010
so it's,
there's,

2655
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:37,100
there's definitely a death metal thing 
where they've gone down all those people

2656
01:52:37,101 --> 01:52:41,540
that concert or some paris,
leon France,

2657
01:52:41,541 --> 01:52:41,990
the,
uh,

2658
01:52:41,991 --> 01:52:44,750
the truck driver that drove over.
Everybody pull.

2659
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:45,980
Yeah.
And

2660
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,840
I mean,
there's a lot less of.

2661
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:52,960
We are right,
it's more of look what's happening and 

2662
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:55,961
it's more,
it's definitely more fear based rather 

2663
01:52:55,961 --> 01:52:55,961
than if we're just united and we stand 
against this,

2664
01:52:55,961 --> 01:52:57,630
there still is that.
It's just not as big.

2665
01:52:57,770 --> 01:53:02,770
Well,
I was in New York right after September 

2666
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:02,770
11th.
It wasn't very long afterwards.

2667
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:05,120
And I remember it was amazing how 
friendly everybody was.

2668
01:53:05,121 --> 01:53:10,121
It was just a different feel.
People Were shook and their response in 

2669
01:53:10,191 --> 01:53:13,550
recovery to that was people were smarter
and smarter,

2670
01:53:13,551 --> 01:53:16,280
kinder and they were smiling more and 
it's just,

2671
01:53:16,281 --> 01:53:17,830
it was a different.
It was a different feel.

2672
01:53:17,831 --> 01:53:22,220
There was more comradery and massive,
massive respect to first responders.

2673
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:27,280
Yes,
massive respect to police and fire 

2674
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:27,280
department.
They had just,

2675
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:31,121
there was a different feeling and how 
the people felt about them instead of 

2676
01:53:31,121 --> 01:53:33,851
being the oppressors,
they became the saviors and it not 

2677
01:53:33,851 --> 01:53:33,851
fireman.

2678
01:53:33,851 --> 01:53:34,490
I mean,
nobody ever thinks of the firemen is the

2679
01:53:34,491 --> 01:53:35,580
oppressors.
Firemen.

2680
01:53:35,670 --> 01:53:40,670
Well,
there's was a thing in the riots after 

2681
01:53:40,670 --> 01:53:40,670
the riots in la where they were 
attacking fireman like they were.

2682
01:53:40,930 --> 01:53:42,020
Yeah.
it was horrible.

2683
01:53:42,021 --> 01:53:43,670
There was shooting at him.
It was,

2684
01:53:43,671 --> 01:53:48,671
um,
a thing where people just decided that 

2685
01:53:48,671 --> 01:53:49,280
the man,
whoever the man is needed to go down,

2686
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:54,281
whether it was fire department or police
and they were shooting at cops and 

2687
01:53:54,281 --> 01:53:58,090
that's insanity.
They were burning buildings down that 

2688
01:53:58,090 --> 01:53:59,180
had nothing to do with the riots.
And I'm sure you saw there was a,

2689
01:53:59,181 --> 01:54:04,181
um,
a piece on these korean business owners 

2690
01:54:04,181 --> 01:54:07,541
in Korea town.
They were invaded during the riots 

2691
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:07,541
because,
you know,

2692
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:07,541
they're not the best,
uh,

2693
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:12,160
the proximity to where all the south 
central shit was going down post rodney 

2694
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:16,421
king and these people were on the 
rooftops just trying to defend their 

2695
01:54:16,421 --> 01:54:16,421
stores and trying to,
you know,

2696
01:54:16,421 --> 01:54:20,950
stop looters from taking away everything
they earned and everything they worked 

2697
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,950
for their whole lives.

2698
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:25,450
And you know,
those moments when things get chaotic,

2699
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:30,880
they do open up the door for people to 
reconsider how fortunate we are when 

2700
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:31,500
things aren't chaotic.
Right?

2701
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,000
It's,
I think that's a very unfortunate thing 

2702
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:37,000
that we only open up our,
our,

2703
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,121
our,
our open ourselves up after something 

2704
01:54:41,121 --> 01:54:41,121
horrible.
Um,

2705
01:54:41,121 --> 01:54:42,110
and because I think that we see horrible
thing after a horrible thing,

2706
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:47,870
we slowly get further and further away 
from being able to unite just because 

2707
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:51,461
it's at least in our 24 slash seven news
cycle it seems like if that's just the 

2708
01:54:51,461 --> 01:54:52,010
world we live in,
right?

2709
01:54:52,011 --> 01:54:55,310
It's just like they're scary shit man.
Hopefully we can keep that away from us.

2710
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:57,920
And again,
it goes back to what we're talking about

2711
01:54:57,921 --> 01:55:02,921
really early on.
I just honestly think we're taking in 

2712
01:55:02,921 --> 01:55:05,830
too much data,
like your life in my life should really 

2713
01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:10,541
revolve around the people that were in 
contact with the people that we 

2714
01:55:10,541 --> 01:55:14,711
communicate with and our immediate 
surroundings and our immediate 

2715
01:55:14,711 --> 01:55:15,290
surroundings.
We both work in the same area.

2716
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:17,690
It's really pleasant.
It's really fine.

2717
01:55:17,691 --> 01:55:19,850
And the folks we run into for the most 
part,

2718
01:55:19,851 --> 01:55:23,530
like 99 point nine percent of them are 
very pleasant and hi,

2719
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:24,410
how you doing?
What's up?

2720
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:26,030
How are you?
Everything's good,

2721
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:31,060
you know?
And that's really how we're supposed to 

2722
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:31,060
be thinking about the world.
This is,

2723
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:34,820
this is our world.
But now our world is extended to include

2724
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:39,850
Pakistan and North Korea.
And what is happening here and what's 

2725
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:40,520
happening there?
Did you hear that?

2726
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:44,190
King john owns half brother was with 
some toxic

2727
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,230
painters.
Like fuck man,

2728
01:55:46,231 --> 01:55:47,700
why don't have to think about that guy.
I don't know.

2729
01:55:47,701 --> 01:55:50,370
That guy is too many people.
There's too much.

2730
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:53,670
And that can really give you this really
bizarre,

2731
01:55:53,671 --> 01:55:57,270
twisted sense of the state of the world 
that the.

2732
01:55:57,780 --> 01:56:02,780
If you just go out now and look at like 
bill hicks used to have a joke about 

2733
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:03,450
that,
about watching cnn and it was all about.

2734
01:56:03,451 --> 01:56:05,910
Because a jane fonda wouldn't fuck ted 
turner.

2735
01:56:05,911 --> 01:56:09,350
This is back when you'd go outside and 
uh,

2736
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,000
you know,
they'd be like today on the news aids,

2737
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:13,030
death,
murder,

2738
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:14,660
pitbulls,
guns,

2739
01:56:14,770 --> 01:56:19,770
stabbings,
and you go outside hear birds chirping 

2740
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:20,600
or where the fuck is all this happening?
I forget

2741
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:21,910
what I was listening to,
but it was,

2742
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:26,920
it was,
it was a comparison to when people are 

2743
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:26,920
thinking about the world,
when they're thinking about the country,

2744
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:29,490
all of that is usually far,
far different when they talk about their

2745
01:56:29,491 --> 01:56:32,730
local community.
Because our local community were like,

2746
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:33,520
oh,
things are for them.

2747
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:38,600
A lot of people think things are good.
Obviously there are places where bad 

2748
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:38,600
shit's happening,
but when we look at our own community,

2749
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:43,431
we're like,
that's great and I do think that's a 

2750
01:56:43,431 --> 01:56:43,431
place where we start,
right?

2751
01:56:43,431 --> 01:56:47,330
Make me for sure.
May make the local good and try and 

2752
01:56:47,330 --> 01:56:47,430
expand from there because yeah,
when,

2753
01:56:47,431 --> 01:56:52,080
when when you look out and you,
you look at it specifically like chicago

2754
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:55,500
as the state of the United States,
that's not what it is.

2755
01:56:55,501 --> 01:57:00,501
It's scary.
They're sitting side of chicago was 

2756
01:57:00,501 --> 01:57:00,660
actually really nice.
Yeah.

2757
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:01,230
Right.
Well,

2758
01:57:01,231 --> 01:57:06,231
so yeah,
once again you have to look at specific 

2759
01:57:06,231 --> 01:57:07,881
places,
but like when trump is saying when 

2760
01:57:07,881 --> 01:57:11,210
donald trump's talking about chicago,
this is stuff that I've been talking to 

2761
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:11,210
my show like two years.

2762
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:15,060
I had segments almost every monday where
it was like this is how many people died

2763
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:19,470
in chicago and it's crazy numbers,
but then you look,

2764
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,210
you look close and you're just like,
oh,

2765
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:26,270
things are good.
And I think that's where everyone needs 

2766
01:57:26,270 --> 01:57:28,311
to start,
start locally and then kind of expand 

2767
01:57:28,311 --> 01:57:30,150
from there to get that local to somehow 
or another make its way into chicago.

2768
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:31,950
Yeah.
Because most people,

2769
01:57:31,951 --> 01:57:32,830
you just,
you have your,

2770
01:57:32,831 --> 01:57:34,980
your small little group.
You're,

2771
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:37,860
you're in a great position where I get 
to talk to hundreds of thousands,

2772
01:57:37,861 --> 01:57:39,510
millions of people.
Same for me.

2773
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:40,580
Um,
and,

2774
01:57:40,581 --> 01:57:45,581
and we're in this exceptional,
amazing position that of I feel like I'm

2775
01:57:45,601 --> 01:57:49,500
so scared to do the wrong thing,
but how were you scared to do the wrong?

2776
01:57:49,610 --> 01:57:54,610
I don't want to mislead people.
That's what I mean in the sense of like 

2777
01:57:54,610 --> 01:57:57,081
when I do my show,
it's just like I have a whole team for 

2778
01:57:57,081 --> 01:57:57,081
full production and stuff like that.

2779
01:57:57,081 --> 01:58:01,280
But I'm,
I'm researching it because it's my name 

2780
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,951
on the line and I want to really in the 
past year and a half just focusing like 

2781
01:58:03,951 --> 01:58:05,520
how do we get to the truth?
I'm not infallible.

2782
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:07,590
They're going to be mistakes and stuff 
along the way.

2783
01:58:07,830 --> 01:58:12,570
But how can I try and I guess I got 10 
minutes to 20 minutes of someone's life.

2784
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:13,410
Right?
And that's,

2785
01:58:13,411 --> 01:58:18,411
that's hUge,
especially with how much information 

2786
01:58:18,411 --> 01:58:20,631
people are getting and people hold on to
shit that they see in a fucking two 

2787
01:58:20,631 --> 01:58:24,580
second glimmer of a tweet.
So I want to make sure that I'm trying 

2788
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:26,790
in that way to make my community,
which happens to be a little larger than

2789
01:58:26,791 --> 01:58:28,410
your everyday joe.
Good.

2790
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,120
Like a good,
good,

2791
01:58:30,121 --> 01:58:31,860
smart place where we don't have to 
agree,

2792
01:58:31,861 --> 01:58:33,480
but we're working on iT.
Great.

2793
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:34,990
You're doing the right thing,
man.

2794
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:37,130
It's very admirable.
I,

2795
01:58:37,131 --> 01:58:42,131
you know,
I think what we're talking about with 

2796
01:58:42,131 --> 01:58:42,680
chicago,
Syria and all these other things too,

2797
01:58:42,681 --> 01:58:47,681
just when you're dealIng with the data 
from 7 billion people and that is 

2798
01:58:47,890 --> 01:58:49,600
unfathomable.
It's impossible.

2799
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:54,780
It's impossible to handle.
And so that's why take a look then look 

2800
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:55,750
like you're saying around you and start 
from there.

2801
01:58:55,900 --> 01:59:00,900
Yeah.
Because otherwise you're going to at 

2802
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,641
some point and just be completely wrong 
and I think it's probably a good idea 

2803
01:59:02,641 --> 01:59:04,000
for all of us.
You and I included to filter out some of

2804
01:59:04,001 --> 01:59:09,001
the data that we're taking in.
There's just too much at this point in 

2805
01:59:09,001 --> 01:59:12,601
time.
You can just be inundated with horrific 

2806
01:59:12,601 --> 01:59:13,160
news all day long if you so choose to.
Oh yeah.

2807
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:14,920
You know,
and there those rabbIt holes you can.

2808
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:16,900
Sometimes it's just there,
Alex Jones,

2809
01:59:16,901 --> 01:59:18,250
until your fucking head explodes.

2810
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:23,280
I mean you really could.
You can go down to all the dark pizza 

2811
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:23,280
gate rabbit holes until you can't take 
it anymore.

2812
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:27,961
It's just you.
You can find the worst parts of the 

2813
01:59:27,961 --> 01:59:28,330
world,
the worst pockets of terrorism,

2814
01:59:28,331 --> 01:59:33,331
the worst,
and you just absorb yourself in that 

2815
01:59:33,331 --> 01:59:34,390
data and then you wIll be convinced 
that's the life that is the world,

2816
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:38,350
but I think that's why people have to 
fight a good fight right now to be like,

2817
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:39,850
oh,
we're heroes.

2818
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:45,030
But I think that's why you have to have 
people that throw themselves out there 

2819
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:47,110
that are going to get steamrolled by 
people that oppose on that specific day,

2820
01:59:47,111 --> 01:59:52,111
that viewpoint,
but you have to have those people 

2821
01:59:52,111 --> 01:59:53,170
because otherwise the just the people 
that have that time that want to see the

2822
01:59:53,171 --> 01:59:55,540
world just fucking implode.
Right?

2823
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:58,180
They're the people that have a lot of 
people that have that time,

2824
01:59:58,181 --> 02:00:03,181
so we have to,
I think be dedicated to have a 

2825
02:00:03,181 --> 02:00:03,181
conversation and this is the last thing 
I want to ask you about,

2826
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:07,390
and this might come off as being silly,
but I think there might be some validity

2827
02:00:07,391 --> 02:00:07,660
to it.

2828
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:13,020
Do you think that this ability that you 
have and and I have and all the people 

2829
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:17,911
that come on this podcast or any podcast
have this new ability to express ideas 

2830
02:00:17,911 --> 02:00:22,831
and communicate.
Do you think that that is having an 

2831
02:00:22,831 --> 02:00:25,891
effect on the way people view the world 
and that this open form of communication

2832
02:00:28,031 --> 02:00:30,750
where you know,
you and I with I,

2833
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:35,760
I've never been trained in the media.
Have you Trained as an emt but he told 

2834
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:39,310
you how to do this right now,
but you and I to normal people,

2835
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:44,760
we can communicate to millions of people
having this conversation and then 

2836
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:49,050
millions of people will talk to their 
friends and express their own opinions.

2837
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:52,120
Whether they agree,
disagree,

2838
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:54,310
or maybe have some other things to add 
to it.

2839
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:59,580
They express that to their friends at 
work and their friends you know at home 

2840
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:04,620
and these dialogues take on a life of 
their own and they they they these ideas

2841
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:10,590
that we're expressing and that other 
people expressing at work or at play 

2842
02:01:10,590 --> 02:01:15,080
there,
they're more potent now and they spread 

2843
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:18,721
faster now than they ever have before 
and I think there's an evolution of 

2844
02:01:18,721 --> 02:01:19,240
ideas that's taking place now.

2845
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,360
Good and bad.
That's where all the whIte privilege 

2846
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:26,821
shit comes from and all the,
all the gender politics and all the 

2847
02:01:26,821 --> 02:01:30,520
weirdness,
all of it comes from these turbo charged

2848
02:01:30,521 --> 02:01:35,521
ideas,
these nuclear ideas now where ideas 

2849
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:38,701
spread to the point where words become 
taboo and use the wrong gender pronoun 

2850
02:01:40,611 --> 02:01:45,611
when you're talking about a trans person
and you're the worst human ever and all 

2851
02:01:45,611 --> 02:01:48,971
these new things that are existing and I
think these new things are because 

2852
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:54,680
dialogue and information is just.
It has a different weight to it now.

2853
02:01:54,681 --> 02:01:56,660
It's almost like the gravity has shifted
on it.

2854
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:01,760
I think a lot of the reason why we have 
our positions and other people do it is 

2855
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:04,830
because it is that it is a,
it is a dialogue.

2856
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:07,500
It is in a weird way and extended 
friend,

2857
02:02:07,501 --> 02:02:11,730
group friends talking about things.
That's where people have,

2858
02:02:11,731 --> 02:02:16,731
I think,
the best conversations as far as where 

2859
02:02:16,731 --> 02:02:16,731
we grow,
right?

2860
02:02:16,731 --> 02:02:20,070
If mean they constantly come out with 
numbers of the trust in media,

2861
02:02:20,370 --> 02:02:22,320
right?
Just like they have an agenda,

2862
02:02:22,321 --> 02:02:24,210
but if it's just people talking,
right,

2863
02:02:24,270 --> 02:02:26,060
this guy's talking,
um,

2864
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:30,120
that you don't feel like joe's got this 
agenda that he wants to just shoved down

2865
02:02:30,121 --> 02:02:32,040
everyone's throat or they're gonna be 
people that say that.

2866
02:02:32,041 --> 02:02:35,250
But I think that's good.
It is.

2867
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:40,340
There's always going to be shit that 
then becomes this like confirmation 

2868
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:45,111
bias.
I only deal with the friends that 

2869
02:02:45,111 --> 02:02:45,111
confirm what I think,
but I think,

2870
02:02:45,111 --> 02:02:48,030
I think it's a very good thing.
It's where it's the more human way to,

2871
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:52,360
to take in information and,
and form an opinion and,

2872
02:02:52,361 --> 02:02:53,730
and grow from it.
I think

2873
02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:56,430
that opinion's going to shift to and 
move around.

2874
02:02:56,630 --> 02:03:01,630
It does.
Because when people look back and 

2875
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:01,630
they're like,
this person flip flop,

2876
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:01,630
that person fucking grew.
hopefully.

2877
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:06,580
I mean,
iT could be completely calculated it on 

2878
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:06,580
pandora and blah blah

2879
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:06,700
data or change who they are.
I mean,

2880
02:03:06,701 --> 02:03:07,310
you,
you

2881
02:03:07,330 --> 02:03:09,490
know,
flip flopping things so silly.

2882
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:10,210
It's like,
oh,

2883
02:03:10,211 --> 02:03:11,710
this person has a yes,
hopefully,

2884
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:16,740
hopefully you can have a different 
opinion that you're not locked into 

2885
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:16,740
something.
And so that's,

2886
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:19,620
I think that everyone needs to focus on 
it with like the not the,

2887
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:22,570
not ever going to school for this sort 
of thing.

2888
02:03:22,571 --> 02:03:25,810
I've never taken a journalism class.
I've talked about it in a video.

2889
02:03:26,050 --> 02:03:27,100
Uh,
I focus on,

2890
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:28,580
I call like the liquor method,
right?

2891
02:03:28,590 --> 02:03:30,250
I listened,
I questioned,

2892
02:03:30,490 --> 02:03:34,600
I research and I refute right.
So I take in as many sources as I can,

2893
02:03:35,410 --> 02:03:40,410
whether it be the huffington post and 
cnn or fox news,

2894
02:03:40,721 --> 02:03:41,770
breitbart,
the donald,

2895
02:03:41,771 --> 02:03:43,480
anything I want to see where everyone's 
coming from,

2896
02:03:43,570 --> 02:03:45,520
right?
Then I start throwing out questions,

2897
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:46,350
you know,
where,

2898
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:47,650
where,
where does this come from?

2899
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:52,860
What do they say?
Go down that rabbit hole with research 

2900
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:52,900
and then I'm armed with information.

2901
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:57,900
That's why I think whether you have a 
milo or you have fucking anybody let 

2902
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,260
people talk so you can learn because 
information's ammo,

2903
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:00,520
right?
Information,

2904
02:04:00,521 --> 02:04:02,800
something that you can take in,
understand,

2905
02:04:03,070 --> 02:04:05,920
but if it's a flawed argument,
even if it's opinion based,

2906
02:04:05,921 --> 02:04:09,100
if it's a flawed argument,
then you can use it and then,

2907
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:12,010
and maybe it's not a flawed argument,
you fucking learn something,

2908
02:04:12,430 --> 02:04:13,000
right?
Maybe.

2909
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:14,830
Maybe you thought you were right,
you were wrong.

2910
02:04:14,831 --> 02:04:16,120
That's cool.
That's fine.

2911
02:04:16,270 --> 02:04:18,040
Like,
flip flop,

2912
02:04:18,041 --> 02:04:19,720
have a different opinion.
Uh,

2913
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:21,640
so I'm,
I'm for it all day.

2914
02:04:21,641 --> 02:04:25,660
I think you got to grow.
I think there are people that wake up in

2915
02:04:25,661 --> 02:04:27,280
the morning,
a fucking burn the world,

2916
02:04:27,281 --> 02:04:32,281
but I don't,
I refuse to believe that that's the 

2917
02:04:32,281 --> 02:04:32,281
majority.
And,

2918
02:04:32,281 --> 02:04:35,870
and I'm going to start trying to deal 
with people I think that are sensible 

2919
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:35,980
that at the very least think they're 
sensible.

2920
02:04:36,250 --> 02:04:38,170
Weed ouT.
The ones really aren't once

2921
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:41,940
tested and just fucking go.
I'm a hundred percent with you.

2922
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:44,580
And I really liked what you're doing 
because I think you're a very reasonable

2923
02:04:44,581 --> 02:04:47,070
guy.
I think you're very well thought out and

2924
02:04:47,071 --> 02:04:50,880
when you consider things like the most 
recent milo video you're being,

2925
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:55,920
you're being very fair and I think the 
world needs more of that reasonable and 

2926
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,180
fair.
Thank you phil.

2927
