00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:01,670
Hello,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,080
freak bitches.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,520
What's the turtle thing?

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,070
What's,

5
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,551
that's a,

6
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,384
that's a,

7
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,820
a jocular expression I guess
from a Stephen Hawking book.

8
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:09,811
Um,

9
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:10,110
it's,

10
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,560
it's a,

11
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,560
it's like an old comedic reference to the
infinite regress problem in cosmology,

12
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:17,521
which,

13
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,120
you know,

14
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,953
the

15
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,210
based on all the shit we were talking
about earlier and there's a story,

16
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:27,030
I guess there was some professor at Oxford
or somewhere were given a speech and

17
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,190
explaining how the universe works and,

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,930
and everything else in some
little lady stood up and said,

19
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:34,261
you know,

20
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,190
it's really clever.

21
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:37,320
I know you think you're
smart but you're wrong.

22
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,121
And he's like,

23
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:39,391
oh yeah,

24
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:39,841
well what's,

25
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,260
what's the,

26
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,981
what's the truth?

27
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:41,341
And she's like,

28
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:41,461
well,

29
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:45,720
the earth sits on the back of this giant
cosmic turtle and carries it through

30
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:46,554
space.

31
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,641
And he said,

32
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:47,821
well,

33
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:48,870
what's carrying the turtle?

34
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:49,231
And she's like,

35
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:49,381
oh,

36
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:50,161
that's very clever,

37
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,180
but it's another turtle.

38
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:52,921
And he's like,

39
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:53,071
well,

40
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:53,680
what's under that?

41
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,150
She's like,

42
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,560
you might as well you're
wasting your time.

43
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,850
It's turtles all the way down.

44
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,350
And so hocking referenced
this in brief history of time.

45
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,300
And it's weird because you can look back,

46
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,930
I'm Hindu cosmology and a lot of,

47
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:07,764
uh,

48
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,090
some native American tribes,

49
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:14,091
they all held these earthly turtles and
high reverence and the symbology of it

50
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:18,810
all and they find that story in
different cultures throughout,

51
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,070
you know,

52
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,430
space but thousands of years.

53
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:24,840
But there's this weird weird referenced
to this cosmic turtle and the Indians or

54
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:28,290
the Hindu thought there were these four
elephant standing on the back of the

55
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:32,360
turtle and the earth was a flat disk
rest on its back and it just cruised

56
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:32,941
through space.

57
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:35,220
There's a lot of artwork you
can find associated to this.

58
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:38,480
And I just thought that
it was really the law,

59
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,590
the record at its core is about love.

60
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,310
You know,

61
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,150
being like this one universal truth
and you get a lot of people look to

62
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:45,511
religion.

63
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:47,210
A lot of people look to drugs.

64
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,570
I'm not saying you can't get
really spiritual experiences
from all those things,

65
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:56,571
but I think love at the end of the day
is the one thing that really I've ever

66
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,030
found forced me to want to wake up and
really try to be a better human being.

67
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:00,630
Every day,

68
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,410
you know,

69
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,370
so that was the main point of the album
and the turtles thing was just kind of,

70
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,890
it's,

71
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,380
it's a way of saying if you get into an
argument with somebody and you realize

72
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,200
it's just pointless,

73
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,250
you're going back and forth.

74
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:14,160
It's turtles all the way down
because nobody really knows shit,

75
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:14,994
you know,

76
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,830
and we're all just trying
to not kill each other.

77
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,520
So I don't know.

78
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,170
I decided it would make
a good country song.

79
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,530
Maybe you just need to
talk to Kirk Cameron.

80
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:24,770
You know,

81
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,910
you're talking a lot of shit,

82
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,180
but you don't really know until
you sit down with Kirk Cameron.

83
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,570
Have you ever seen his buddy that shows
that banana is proof of evolution?

84
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,070
That was the ray comfort.

85
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,401
Yes.

86
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,091
This dumb fuck.

87
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:39,050
Who doesn't even understand
that we changed the way
bananas look like this guy.

88
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,420
He caused the banana and
the atheist nightmare.

89
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,410
Have you seen that video?

90
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,400
It's beautiful,

91
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:43,850
man.

92
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,180
Yeah.

93
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,601
I'm sorry.

94
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:45,790
That video's beautiful.

95
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,470
Yeah,

96
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,450
it's and him and Duane Gish and the gish
gallop where you're just like throwing

97
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:51,830
a word salad at somebody.

98
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:52,101
It's like,

99
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:52,281
oh,

100
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:52,581
well,

101
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:55,200
evolution isn't true because it's like,

102
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:55,450
dude,

103
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,000
shut up.

104
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,900
They're all just gay.

105
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,793
That's what it is.

106
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,380
That's fine.

107
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:00,760
No,

108
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,360
it's great.

109
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,320
Nothing wrong with being gay,

110
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,500
but I really believe that that's what's
going on with most of those guys.

111
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,370
They're the reason why they're so hog.

112
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:08,560
Wild for Jesus.

113
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,700
Like Kirk Cameron.

114
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,810
That's a gay man.

115
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,460
I'm not a gay man,

116
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,400
but I'm pretty good at spotting
some things in this life.

117
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,660
I know what a gay man it looks like.

118
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,770
I know know it all.

119
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,420
Gay Men look like I've been fooled before,

120
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,070
but you know what I'm saying?

121
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,390
It's like you put a fucking
lizard outfit on dog.

122
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,200
I'm going to go,

123
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,441
hmm.

124
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:27,610
Something's up with that lizard.

125
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,570
What is this?

126
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,470
That same with the banana.

127
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:29,891
Oh yeah,

128
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:30,131
that's.

129
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:30,671
There it is.

130
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:30,881
Yeah.

131
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:32,000
Peeling it and.

132
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,681
Oh Wow.

133
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:33,010
Man.

134
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,843
Goof bag.

135
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,361
He doesn't eat,

136
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,270
but he never even bothered doing
the work to understand that.

137
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,040
We used to have different looking
fucking bananas within the,

138
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,030
within the written human record
like that ain't that long ago.

139
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:45,820
Stupid.

140
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,061
Yeah,

141
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,180
it's and,

142
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,330
and somebody brought,

143
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,110
I think once somebody
brought him an actual,

144
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,460
a non,

145
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,410
like an original natural
banana and he was like,

146
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:53,980
what's that?

147
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,813
It's a banana.

148
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,301
You dumb.

149
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,134
Fuck,

150
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:56,950
sorry.

151
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,570
Because he started,

152
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,850
he knew that part of his brain is
all just for fighting off cock,

153
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,400
fighting off the love of the COC.

154
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,230
So he puts that just,

155
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,640
I don't have any room for that.

156
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,660
I can't do that kind of research
and busy fighting off the gay.

157
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,680
So I'll just sit here with this banana.

158
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,830
It's pontificate.

159
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,360
I mean he could,

160
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,110
if that,

161
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,943
if that,

162
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,970
if as any way shape or form
a hypothesis were true,

163
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,020
it's my thesis.

164
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,173
Why?

165
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,080
Why are you such a phallic symbol?

166
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,483
Why did he,

167
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,560
for all the same reasons,

168
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,660
he doesn't understand what he's doing,

169
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,950
what's drawn to it,

170
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,030
the transference,

171
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:34,811
you know,

172
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:35,051
in,

173
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:35,831
into the symbol.

174
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:37,510
So it's actually giving them power.

175
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,350
It makes them feel comfortable,

176
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,410
but it's such a ridiculous proposition
that God made a food that we could hold

177
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:44,810
perfectly well.

178
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,250
What?

179
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,360
Tomatoes are no good,

180
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:46,811
like why,

181
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:47,561
why can't you.

182
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,270
I mean a fucking tomatoes
pretty easily held to like,

183
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,190
that's really stupid.

184
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,890
Why isn't banana shaped which tomato?

185
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,490
That's true,

186
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:54,751
right?

187
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:54,851
Yeah.

188
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:56,620
You've got cherry tomatoes carries,

189
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,101
hothouse.

190
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:57,710
Great.

191
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,031
You know,

192
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:03,031
all these different ones because we've
modified them and we modified them.

193
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,120
We got involved.

194
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,120
Your light is.

195
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,150
Do you find it really rewarding to be
out in this incredibly wild environment?

196
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:13,570
Like when you come to a city like
you go from that to New York City.

197
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,720
Is New York City just like a cool little
vacation for you and then do you do,

198
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,800
do you appreciate the wild or do you
appreciate New York because of the wild or

199
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:25,894
both?

200
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,023
Does that make sense?

201
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,420
You know,

202
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,320
my lifestyle,

203
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,870
the challenges I face and overcoming that,

204
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,243
um,

205
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,490
there is such pride in yourself that,

206
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,151
oh my gosh,

207
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:38,984
I did that.

208
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,890
How cool is that

209
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,210
in being really little.

210
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:43,451
I mean,

211
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:43,601
I,

212
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:45,550
I terrified of the dark,

213
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,630
but now I live in a place that's
dark for nine months out of the year.

214
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,420
You know,

215
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,040
I mean there are always challenges.

216
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,990
Know yourself better yourself,

217
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,990
you know?

218
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,520
Um,

219
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,840
when I go to a city

220
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,401
a bear,

221
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,020
I know exactly what he wants from me,

222
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,480
you know,

223
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,420
pretty much he's either going to eat you
or he wants something here I was just

224
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,021
passing through,

225
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:07,340
but it's a pretty honest relationship.

226
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,061
He wants to eat me.

227
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:08,894
I don't want them to.

228
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,320
You go to a big city and I'm
used to seeing my horizon.

229
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm always checking things.

230
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,511
There's no trees,

231
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,261
there's no buildings.

232
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,200
There's nothing tomorrow.

233
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,053
My horizon,

234
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,600
I go to New York and you can't go eight
feet and you've got a 60 story building.

235
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,310
How the hell do you check your horizon?

236
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,050
How do you know what's coming at you?

237
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,490
You see people,

238
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,380
but you cannot be guaranteed.

239
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,790
When I see a bear and he's charging,

240
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,050
I know he wants to attack me.

241
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,450
You see a person walking down the street,

242
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,200
you don't know whether he's going
to pull a gun out of his pocket.

243
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:37,190
Shake your hand,

244
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:39,200
pinch your ass or wave goodbye.

245
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,190
You don't know.

246
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,660
So that's a Predator that I'm pretty
impressed people want to be around.

247
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,630
When I got here,

248
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,120
look at all these lights
and all these people.

249
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:49,540
I'm like,

250
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,171
oh my God,

251
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:51,004
and they're here on purpose.

252
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,530
What's weird?

253
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,410
And so I always wrestling with this
whole time because when I go to these

254
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:57,244
places,

255
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,960
I love the culture.

256
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,220
I love the people.

257
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,373
Um,

258
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,690
even there I was trying to
learn Swahili with some of the,

259
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,380
um,

260
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,200
the trackers that we're working with me.

261
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,430
Uh,

262
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,430
Rashidi awesome guy speaks only swahili
but so I really invest myself into the

263
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:18,130
culture and I just want to learn.

264
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:20,140
I want to sort of get,

265
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,790
I want to see things through their eyes.

266
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,403
Well,

267
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,060
I saw these grass shacks
and all these people in,

268
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,441
you know,

269
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:29,950
every grass shack had six
little kids running around it.

270
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,700
And it was just like,

271
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,040
I'm thinking this is awful.

272
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,610
I mean,

273
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,600
it's no hope for six kids at
every grass shack that seems.

274
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,561
I don't know,

275
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,150
it just seemed very sad to me,

276
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,400
but we're,

277
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,550
we're there getting ready to cross this
river in the truck and the river was

278
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:45,850
high.

279
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,720
So we're kind of out a Ryan Shalom is the,

280
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,823
he's,

281
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,070
he owns Greenleaf,

282
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,923
Tanzania.

283
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:53,781
And so we're,

284
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:56,350
we're there and we're kind
of seeing what's going on.

285
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:00,920
And there was a village about
a quarter mile away and uh,

286
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,550
as we're looking at the river
and trying to make a game plan,

287
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,440
there was music and just
people singing and I'm like,

288
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,630
is it happy hour over here?

289
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,710
What is going on?

290
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,730
And it just,

291
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,230
that really just hit home.

292
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:14,950
It's like,

293
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,161
you know,

294
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,460
I see him and I think there's no
hope and they must be miserable.

295
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,040
But they're laughing
and singing and dancing

296
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,590
maybe.

297
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,610
Maybe they're okay.

298
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,661
I don't know.

299
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:26,290
I mean,

300
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,100
are they happy?

301
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,030
They seemed happy to me
so I don't really care.

302
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,360
So it's weird.

303
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:31,930
It's,

304
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,763
you know,

305
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,430
I don't know.

306
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,790
I can,

307
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,740
I can look at it from
outside and judge and say,

308
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,843
Oh,

309
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,730
you must be so depressed.

310
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,973
Maybe they're not.

311
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,460
I don't know.
