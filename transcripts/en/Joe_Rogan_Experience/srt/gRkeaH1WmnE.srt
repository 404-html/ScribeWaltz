1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
That's everything to me.
See that on the podcast.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,140
What were you just saying?
Young Tony Hinchcliffe.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,480
I love fanny packs and I've been using
them continuously.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,430
Yeah,
that's right.

5
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:14,370
Folks,
don't get scared that the Illuminati and

6
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:16,650
the elite,
they want to keep you from embracing the

7
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:17,800
fanny pack.
They want to.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,540
They want to emasculate you.
It's probably not them.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,890
That's like some group name.
You've heard of the rat pack where the

10
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,724
fanny pack.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,070
Brian's never dared one.
Oh yeah,

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,460
I have yours,
but I wear it all the time.

13
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:30,390
Never seen more,
but you know,

14
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,310
it's cool it.
So there's little ones that stretch.

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,110
Have you ever seen those?
Like super small and they like stretch

16
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:36,870
big.
So you could put like a couple of things

17
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,070
in it or nothing.
Nothing.

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,690
And you can't really see it.
Yeah.

19
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:41,560
Those things are good for jogging the
they,

20
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,020
they,
they pulled tight to you.

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,510
It's a smaller pocket though.
Can't see.

22
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:48,360
The thing with these things is if you
travel as much as we do,

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,720
you just have all your shit in that
thing and you just drop it off.

24
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,620
Just take any thought out of your head
you might have about getting laid.

25
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,490
That won't be happening.
If you are a single person,

26
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,380
you're a single man.
Single girl could pull it off.

27
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,060
We don't give a fuck.

28
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,880
Pennypack would not make her any less
hot.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,490
No need to put a condom in a fanny pack.
You'll never use it.

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,270
Your fanny pack though isn't really
cheesy or anything.

31
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,400
It's actually cool looking.
It's root slim.

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,130
It's.
We sell them.

33
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,170
They put a higher primate logo on it.
Roots does,

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,610
but it's a roots fanny pack.
They are the ones that dice was wearing.

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,760
That's how I found out about it.
Dice came in and I had instant fanny

36
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,750
pack envy.
I was like,

37
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:30,000
what do you have here?
What do you have?

38
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,370
Oh,
this is the one I got

39
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,680
when I'm in the line at Tsa.
I eyeball everybody that's emptying

40
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:43,030
their pockets and I just look at
everybody and then I get snap and drop

41
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:46,060
it like a mic into the things that
everybody just saw me

42
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,060
and it zips up.
Your pockets don't zip up.

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,953
It's better.

44
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,490
Everything falls out of pockets on an
airplane.

45
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,630
There's something about it

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,350
I've worn on stage maybe four times.
You've worn it on word,

47
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,750
on stage in Utah.
It gets in the way though.

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,390
Flopping around.
You're moving too much.

49
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,450
Yeah.
There's certain places where I.

50
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,650
I can't wear a fanny pack in one way it
would work because if you actually moved

51
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:12,250
it to your fanny and there's just
something about that.

52
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:15,070
That's not gonna happen.
If you're going to have a fanny pack,

53
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:15,910
it's got to be in the front

54
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,220
and waterproof.
Broader proof.

55
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:21,450
Fanny packs might be next.
Why not?

56
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,650
Shower with soap in there.
Pull it out.

57
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,930
If you have like a secret and you keep
it in that fanny pack,

58
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,840
so I a picture of your deck or something
like that.

59
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:37,340
You don't want anybody having an actual
physical picture was the one body Kelly

60
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:38,420
always had,
was wearing.

61
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:42,590
It was like when I went over your
shoulder roll a Bandolero.

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,460
What is it?
It's like a fanny pack that's on your

63
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:48,860
chest.
It's like for people who are scared of

64
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:51,650
wearing a fanny packs or they pretend
they're world travelers with skinny

65
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:54,020
souls.
You know those dudes who were like suede

66
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:58,550
shoes of muted colors with thin soles,
you know those kind of guys and they

67
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:01,840
have like skinny on and then they were
like a Satchel.

68
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,130
I have a Satchel.
I just got back from winning and size.

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,260
It's amazing.
These time of year.

70
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,350
Yeah.
That guy works.

71
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,280
Not sure.
I like to take those people,

72
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,710
satchels from them and just wear them
around my waist.

73
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,200
She just turned my Satchel into a fanny
pack.

74
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,700
It's more of a butcher's apron.

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,870
Yeah.
There's something about them.

76
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,190
They,
for whatever reason,

77
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,520
not only do they not catch on,
they became gross.

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,850
Like fanny packs are gross.
They're way more than didn't catch on

79
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,260
this actual,
oh,

80
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,910
this man is very involved in unicef and
the Red Cross.

81
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,880
He goes to foreign lands and the
liberties.

82
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,150
Malaria medicine
ready?

83
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,190
Look at that guy do a uhg.
There's something about you.

84
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,050
When I'm not on the Big Bang theory,
I carry randomly Satchel.

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,810
I had a blow a guy to get this rule.
What's in that size?

86
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:01,720
We're just a bunch of Dicks,
just pubic hair and it's filled with

87
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,760
com.
Thirteen pounds of this when he walks.

88
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,450
All right.
How much,

89
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,490
how much do you think it would wave?
That was filled with come?

90
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,520
How heavy is
thicker than water?

91
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:16,090
So probably about nine pounds.
Gallon of milk.

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,070
Nine pounds.
Why should know?

93
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,570
I've,
I've seen an lms.

94
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,900
We had pitchers of come on.

95
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,160
Fear factor was actual pictures.
What kind of come it was donkey Kong.

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,580
Oh yeah.
Doc,

97
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,700
he comes the cheapest you can get
because donkeys are hybrids and they're

98
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:37,000
not viable.
So that donkey comes just useless.

99
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,970
When you had that much come,
did it separate?

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,030
Like was there like a tough to blend it?
No,

101
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,300
he didn't have to shake it like a
lemonade curdle at the top.

102
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,620
Scoop off.
No,

103
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,940
no,
you didn't have to shake it.

104
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,400
I know what you're talking about.
Some of those energy drinks,

105
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,234
even vixen,
uh,

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,400
you know,
water bottle and then it settles to the

107
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,310
bottom.
You got no comments.

108
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,800
Just come.
It's basically Cox not.

109
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,650
There it is.
Oh no,

110
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,600
those girls,
one of them drank a glass of calm and

111
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:09,080
one drank a glass of urine.
It's the what?

112
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,590
Like there's two times ever doing that
show where I was,

113
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,280
where I was like,
what in the fuck are you doing?

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,560
Like you can't do this.
Like you guys are going too far.

115
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,080
Oh,
she's that donkey.

116
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,550
Donkey come a whole bigger mug full of
donkey.

117
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:27,050
Come God,
I missed somebody sat down and did this,

118
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:28,750
this,
this is how crazy this show was.

119
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,820
Somebody sat down,
said,

120
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:35,821
I got an idea.
It started pitching that people would

121
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:39,760
have to drink donkey come.
It puts my mind that it was on NBC.

122
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,070
Yeah,
and then other people said,

123
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:42,800
yeah,
the,

124
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,080
the.
I like what you're saying.

125
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,090
Makes Sense.
Let's do it.

126
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,490
NBC is as mainstream as it gets.
Like,

127
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,800
Hey,
after you're done enjoying donkey,

128
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:55,450
come watch the nightly news with Tom
Brokaw as mainstream as possible.

129
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,960
And the girl it,
she's

130
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,600
pretending like she didn't love it
though.

131
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:00,434
She liked it.

132
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,620
Ugh.
It's not even her first time drinking

133
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,454
donkeys.
Who?

134
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,650
It was so ridiculous at the shit.
I would love to abstain.

135
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,310
Ridiculous show.
So silly.

136
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,950
That's overkill.
Like being able to look at the donkey.

137
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh God.
I love it.

138
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,650
You're just yelling at these guys,
come on,

139
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,150
chug it.
That guy just shucked it so quick.

140
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,860
They're hugging on each other.
So strange.

141
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,500
It just.
Then they get to throw up.

142
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,960
They have to hold it in their mouth for
like a few seconds or something.

143
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,380
His buddies up and he didn't even drink
it.

144
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,050
I don't need to relive this.
We can stop now.

145
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,750
So unnecessary.
Incredible.

146
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,820
It's just amazing that that was an
actual show.

147
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,900
No,
it was.

148
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
It's amazing.
As amazing to me as it is anybody that

149
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,850
was watching it.
It doesn't even feel like it was me.

150
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,300
I watch it now and even though I know it
was me and I'm like,

151
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,134
I didn't do that.

152
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,240
It's crazy because most shows like for
comedians to host suck and aren't fun at

153
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:01,320
all.
You know what I mean?

154
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:05,730
But eat that show seems like it was.
You were surprised.

155
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,200
Like it's like you get to watch it.
You're like,

156
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,240
oh,
we're making these people drink donkey.

157
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:09,901
Come today.
Like,

158
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,250
how do you not enjoy that?

159
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,680
It's hard.
It's hard to drink to help these people.

160
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,573
You've got to root them on.

161
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,130
Out of all the things on fear factor,
did you ever like sample anything like

162
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:22,990
dip your finger in anything and try it
or.

163
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,370
Yeah,

164
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,040
eat a bunch of shit.
The first episode I felt bad.

165
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:31,480
The people that eat sheep's eyeball,
so I said I went to just for a goof,

166
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:32,950
but I don't even think we put that on
camera.

167
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,430
I just said I'll do it for you.
Did it tastes because the sheep shit.

168
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,400
You fucking can't help yourself.
You literally can't help yourself.

169
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,940
No,
it didn't taste that bad.

170
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:49,330
It was not that big a deal.
It's more of in your head than anything.

171
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,580
I ate a tomato horn worm again.
All in your head.

172
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,920
The actual taste and now that I'm not
that big a deal.

173
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,910
Those were the big ones.
The juicy.

174
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,480
Yeah.
It exploded in my mouth.

175
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,460
Didn't,
didn't taste bad at all.

176
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,160
It's like nothing.
I'm cockroach.

177
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:07,990
I had a big ass cockroach.
What was that?

178
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,080
Madagascar hissing cockroach.
Was it alive?

179
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,820
Well,
there was a young lady that was on the

180
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:17,170
show and she was going to get kicked off
if she didn't do something else.

181
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,700
Like she had to do something to stay in
the show.

182
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:19,930
It was all for charity.
Right.

183
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,290
So because it was a celebrity fear
factor out.

184
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,750
Alison Sweeney,
I believe her name is from days of our

185
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:28,540
lives and uh,
so I said,

186
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,460
look,
if you eat one of these,

187
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:33,130
a roach,
I don't know who came up with this idea,

188
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,350
someone in the,
the office,

189
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,320
she's,
I'm like,

190
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,560
if eat one of these roaches you can
stay.

191
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,850
And she said,
uh,

192
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,430
I can't even roach.
I go,

193
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:43,090
what about a worm?
I go,

194
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:46,450
what about two worms?
I think we made a deal like she maybe

195
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:49,840
she ate two worms or something like that
and I had to eat a roche.

196
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,440
So stupid.
It's just such a ridiculous show.

197
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,710
But anyway,
the point is there's,

198
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,480
this roach tasted like nothing is.
Nothing

199
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,010
made me cough because
although I was kind of put all the

200
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:16,400
little legs and the parts and stuff,
why would you do that?

201
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,580
You love it.
That's hilarious.

202
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,980
What Baldwin brother?
The Baldwin brother,

203
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,410
Steven.
It's nice guy.

204
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,400
Very nice guy.
I would have loved to have seen one.

205
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,271
He did.
Yeah.

206
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:34,300
He Won.
Yeah.

207
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,573
Who's funny,
dude?

208
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,580
He's.
Oh,

209
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,760
you know,
put the Jesus though.

210
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,990
He's with pro Jesus all.
All.

211
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,830
All up with Jesus.
Wow.

212
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,560
Yeah,
he's like a big Jesus like a

213
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,640
proselytizer does like retreats and shit
or something like that.

214
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
Very Jesus oriented individual,
but a happy guy.

215
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,840
Very nice guy.
Yeah.

216
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,850
Kirk Cameron style?
No,

217
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,250
not that far.
No.

218
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,650
Kurt cameras in some wacky place where
they look at a banana and they go,

219
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:08,880
this has to be a sign of God.
Look how the banana fits in your hand.

220
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,100
It is the perfect shape.
Note how appeals designed by the Creator

221
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,480
himself to fit in your hand.
So if you ever seen that ray comfort

222
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:20,160
explains a banana.

223
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,710
We gotta watch this because this is his
boy.

224
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,170
Like these two guys.
They get together and they don't fuck.

225
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,840
They just looked at each other and they
want to and no one does anything and

226
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:29,190
they just keep doing it night after
night.

227
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:31,650
It just talk about Jesus and stare into
each other's eyes,

228
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,690
but this is his buddy that he baldwins.
No,

229
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,480
no,
no.

230
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,950
The other one.
Kurt Cameron.

231
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,900
Oh,
this is his buddy.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,300
It's like off the deep end.
Jesus guy,

233
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,720
and this is the guy that he holds up a
fucking banana and it's the atheist

234
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,590
nightmare.
He says.

235
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,200
He's like,
this is a banana in it is the atheist

236
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,830
atheist's nightmare study a well
wellmade.

237
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,120
You'll find on the fast side of ridges
on the close side,

238
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,820
two ridges.
If you get your hand ready to grip it

239
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,320
around,
you'll find on the far side,

240
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,150
there were three groups on the close
side,

241
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:10,120
two groups,
but banana and the hand off perfectly

242
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:13,290
made one or the other.
You'll find a maker of a banana or

243
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,300
almighty God has made it with a nonslip
surface.

244
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,260
Has Al would indicate,
is it England contents green too early.

245
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,610
Yellow.
Just right.

246
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Black,
too late.

247
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,010
Have you go to the top of the banana?
You'll find as with a soda can make us.

248
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,400
They placed a tab at the top,
so God has placed a tab at the top.

249
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,850
When you pull the tab,
the contents don't squirt in your face.

250
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,460
You'll find a wrapper which is
biodegradable,

251
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,240
has perforations.
Notice how gracefully it sensitivity.

252
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,510
Human hand notice has appointed the top
for ease of entry,

253
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,610
just the right shape.
The human mouth,

254
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,950
it's Chewy,
easy to digest,

255
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,850
has even curved or the face to make the
whole process so much easier.

256
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:52,931
Seriously,
curt,

257
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:54,040
the creation

258
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,040
testifies to the genius of God's
creative writing was about to jump in.

259
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,610
Oh,
you just totally made sense.

260
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,760
What you said wasn't fucking ridiculous
at.

261
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:06,550
Oh,
look how Jesus designed this banana.

262
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,900
Is that.
Get us kicked off youtube.

263
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,010
We're going to have to edit that out.
We're gonna have to edit it out.

264
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,230
Yeah,
most likely.

265
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,320
It's not our content and we don't want
to get booted off Youtube,

266
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,320
but I'm ray comfort banana.
Google it.

267
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,600
It's an awesome God.
It's awesome.

268
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,390
All the gods shit to the side like it is
sort of crazy.

269
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,260
If you think about fruits,
how amazing they are.

270
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,500
Like it's like trick candy and a rapper
already,

271
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,070
you know?
Well,

272
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,440
it's a.
it's like a delivery system trick.

273
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,830
It's like there are seeds inside these
plants and if you eat it,

274
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,840
it goes through your body,
you shit it out.

275
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,190
So it like literally comes with manure,
like it's got a seed,

276
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,040
it's got some manure,
it's got shit to the seed,

277
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:48,874
can grow in.

278
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,680
It's like literally comes out with
fertilizer.

279
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,770
There's a way,
especially with like animals like

280
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,780
undulates,
like cows and stuff like that.

281
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,110
Like they're shitting out like almost
like mulch.

282
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,790
They're shitting out compost mean they,
you take cows shit and you take that

283
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,580
shit and you grow things with it.
I mean it's a great fertilizer.

284
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,350
People use it on their crops,
so it's in a lot of ways I would

285
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:14,110
imagine.
This is just me thinking that this is

286
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,770
what it is,
is like some sort of a like a

287
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,060
transportation device for seeds.
Right?

288
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,350
Doesn't that make sense?
It's crazy.

289
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,330
I never thought of it that way though.
They're like,

290
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:26,500
animals eat the seeds and then they,
they're pooping out the next thing.

291
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,920
It's don't have seeds.
No,

292
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,980
don't.
They don't do that.

293
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,220
If it was really Jesus as if it was
really an atheist nightmare,

294
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:35,710
I think there'd be seeds seedless
beautiful.

295
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,180
If bananas at seeds,
they'd be bunk.

296
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:40,120
Man Fits into math.
Perfect.

297
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,910
I wonder that dummy knows that we've
actually like changed the shape of

298
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:44,770
bananas.
Go,

299
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:45,850
go.
We're going to wild banana.

300
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,280
Those little scrubby ass bitch ass
bananas.

301
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,360
So it's not like those Dole Bananas,
those big whopper bananas were like

302
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,190
cheese.
Those Gmo Bananas.

303
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,850
Even steroids to like a 10 year old's
arm.

304
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,630
Like these Gmo bananas are fucking
ridiculous.

305
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,200
The Brock Lesnar Bananas.
Yeah.

306
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,000
Tell that to ray comfort.
He doesn't understand agriculture.

307
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,400
Silly.
Fuck the way Jesus made this benign.

308
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,950
He's incredible.
He's just such a strange argument,

309
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,410
but it's just.
If that's what you want to believe.

310
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:21,430
If you really want to believe that God
designed a banana so perfectly to let

311
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:24,130
you know that it's food.
Explain coconuts.

312
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,090
Coconuts are fucking awesome for you.
It's so hard to get to them.

313
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,100
You've got to chop through that hoskin.

314
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,040
Pull away all that bullshit that's on
the outside climate.

315
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,000
Huge tree.
First.

316
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,380
You get a crack them open and then you
gotta you gotta take the milk out and

317
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:42,760
the meat you got like scoop the meat of
it and if you want to get the oil all

318
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:45,580
you want to take all that coconut and
turn it into coconut oil.

319
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,960
Oh,
what a pain.

320
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,250
That Dick.
That's gonna be.

321
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,490
Yeah.
Have you seen the certain foods that are

322
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,030
going to get more and more expensive
because of global warming and stuff like

323
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,190
that.
Like the price of chocolate and the

324
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,980
price of coffee is just going to go
through the roof.

325
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,210
Pistachios I guess this year or like
we're like on a shortage.

326
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,930
So you're going to see like pistachios,
like double in price in the next couple

327
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,090
months.
It's really weird.

328
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,640
Like what foods are on the endangered
species list almost.

329
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,290
Maybe we shouldn't live in a place
that's really fucking hot right now when

330
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,110
the earth is getting hotter.
Yeah.

331
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,280
I mean what the fuck is la going to be
like?

332
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,350
La is going to be like Phoenix,
right?

333
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,620
Like Phoenix is like a bump hotter than
La.

334
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,920
Definitely.
When you say a lot like a bump,

335
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,170
a good solid bump,
but everything's shifted.

336
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:34,640
Earthquakes,
hurricanes,

337
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:37,580
everything's kind of like Oklahoma had
an earthquake the other day,

338
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,170
but that's because of fracking.
Yeah.

339
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,090
Yeah.
That is a.

340
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,320
That is no joke,
man.

341
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,420
They're having.
They're having so many earthquakes

342
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,840
because of fracking.
I think Oklahoma just put some.

343
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,790
They put a pause.
Yeah.

344
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,570
I don't know if it's a pause on drilling
new wells or it's a pause on.

345
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,000
It can't be a pause and operating the
wells.

346
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,730
I think it is.
I think it was like 41 different

347
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,900
fracking sites.

348
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,060
Let's find out what it is.
July me.

349
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,620
They're going crazy with fracking.
Ohio has been doing it and they've been

350
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:08,210
getting earthquakes.
It's crazy.

351
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:11,310
It's like we get most of the oil now I
guess from the.

352
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,430
From earth here,
from America.

353
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,940
Oklahoma orders shut down of 37 wells
after earthquake.

354
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,210
Fuck man.
Ooh,

355
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,100
that's crazy.
Good Lord.

356
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,580
Then there's been like the Iraqi look,
a hot.

357
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:30,581
This girl is telling you the news.
That's the new thing isn't really super

358
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:33,380
hot.
Has this like supermodel lady.

359
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,860
She's beautiful.
Have you ever seen the Fox News girls?

360
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,440
They're all like seven feet tall.
I listened to her,

361
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:44,441
but let's watch her face move that
they're just getting the hottest women.

362
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,690
That Mexican weather girl with the but
oh my God,

363
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,940
I've seen that lady love her.
That's ridiculous.

364
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,710
But that's kind of like a gimmick,
right?

365
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,210
And that's Mexico.
What's this?

366
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,350
A CNN like?

367
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,840
This is.
They're just hiring the best looking

368
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,100
people.
Yeah.

369
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,820
You for sexy
light skin,

370
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,150
black check.
Beautiful.

371
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,130
And she's talking to this man,
will I believe in Jesus and Jesus wants

372
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:09,620
us to dig oil.
Look at my tie.

373
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,670
Look at my haircut.
It's conservative as is my approach to

374
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:15,140
language.
Ma'Am.

375
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,810
You won't hear me using any forbidden
words.

376
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,060
You know,
we need to keep the oil prices low.

377
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:26,061
The way to keep the oral process flow is
to continue safe and ethical fracking.

378
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,760
And that's what we're going to do.
Meanwhile,

379
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,900
get back to the hot chick.
Let me see her faith.

380
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,620
You don't get to see it.
What the fuck are they doing?

381
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,900
Like all these shows like Fox News and
all the there.

382
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,210
There's,
there's gotta be something to like the

383
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:48,200
fact that propaganda being delivered by
someone who is so hot.

384
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,310
You just want to stare him like those.

385
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,560
Those Fox ice queens.
Totally.

386
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,950
There's a bunch of them that are just
like,

387
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,640
they're so hot.
You just want to look at their face like

388
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:59,610
little kids get compelled to look at
pretty women's faces.

389
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,360
Fox News has a bunch of stuff
strategically to keep you watching,

390
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:06,810
like spinning things and it's all like.
It's all mental dude.

391
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:10,710
We were watching once and who was it?
Was it the Megan Kelly lady that was

392
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:15,300
crossing and uncrossing your legs like
30 fucking times and she's wearing this

393
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:17,190
little skirt.
Find out.

394
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,930
It might not have been her.
It might've been one of those other

395
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,940
hotties that was high as other Fox
hotties,

396
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,800
but it was ridiculous because she's
wearing literally like she's got a

397
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,850
Napkin over vagina.
It's a small napkin.

398
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,470
I mean it's not as much of a skirt at
all.

399
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,460
She has these super long legs and high
heels on and she's doing this.

400
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:35,540
She should she have a little Bush
because you see her.

401
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,100
No,
you don't get a chance to say she's

402
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,760
very,
very calculated,

403
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,700
very calculated,
but if I was staying with a dude who

404
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:42,930
moved his legs that much,
I'd be like,

405
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,220
Bro,
you okay?

406
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,040
Why keep crossing your legs are fucking
cricket.

407
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,690
You're trying to sing me a song.
You see that?

408
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,090
You see the girl that was twerking in
her butt popped up in her underwear?

409
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,133
Yes.

410
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,430
Fox News.
I don't think that's related.

411
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,140
Brian watches.
Fox News.

412
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,010
Fox News is hurting.
So I keep hearing Fox News is hurting.

413
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,210
I watched routers and uh,
who was it that was saying that they had

414
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:11,610
heard?
Fuck,

415
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,260
I'm trying to remember who was telling
me this.

416
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,900
Was it you?
Will you telling me the thing about a

417
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,930
trump and a television network?
It was trying to remember what,

418
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,800
where I heard it and it was,
I think it was a radio show or

419
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,360
something,
but that there's a lot of those,

420
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,180
a lot of people use added like Sean
Hannity and I think that God has taken

421
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:31,290
over his campaign that used to run fox
or taken over his spot and I don't know

422
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,720
how they're going to transition.
If he loses,

423
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,850
but that trump news channel is going to
be started up next year,

424
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,410
the end of this year,
trump news,

425
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,080
24 hour trump.
Here's what he does.

426
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,240
If he's.
If he was smart,

427
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,430
I mean he's obviously smart,
not right.

428
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,930
He's obviously really good at making
money.

429
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,771
He's obviously,
well,

430
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:48,810
whatever you can say about the
outrageous shit that he says,

431
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,530
that guy's ridiculously successful.
Ridiculously right.

432
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,791
I mean,
yeah,

433
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,770
his dad gave him a big loan to start out
with,

434
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,260
but what the fuck ever at the end of the
day,

435
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:01,590
that guy's ridiculous.
Ridiculously successful.

436
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,740
If he wanted to open a good television
cable network and use that as a platform

437
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:09,730
to set them up for four years from now,
10,

438
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,780
like the kind of fucking shit that he
would say about Hillary and like other

439
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:19,560
candidates that no one would have the
balls to say like he takes it to this

440
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:22,290
non political place.
You know,

441
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,840
like he insults Hillary Clinton all the
time.

442
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:29,040
He calls her crooked Hillary.
Has there ever been to presidential

443
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,790
candidates or one of them had nicknames
for all the other people?

444
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,460
Now he's a genius.
He made fun of everybody,

445
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,570
Lion,
Ted,

446
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,790
who was,
keeps repeating it,

447
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,070
and it becomes like it's.
That's who she is.

448
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:42,380
That's crooked hillary.
Yeah,

449
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,240
it's fucking crazy.
It's amazing what he did.

450
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,310
If she just started calling him like
Orange Donald or something,

451
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,590
it'd be Keller.
She could really fire back.

452
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:54,130
She needs a little like roast help
because he's digging in deep.

453
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,110
It's not just that there's an
uncomfortable sound that she makes when

454
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:00,970
she speaks,
when she gives speeches,

455
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,370
they're not soothing and they don't draw
you in like as much as she is way more

456
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:08,880
qualified to be a leader than he is.
Right.

457
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:12,970
He knows way more about foreign policy.
Knows way more about how Washington

458
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,410
works.
She's deep,

459
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:17,050
right?
Like she'd be a way more qualified

460
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:19,430
leader.
There's something about the quality of

461
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,570
voice she needs to drink.
Some donkey come.

462
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,610
Which by the way is like the end.
Isn't that the democratic.

463
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,530
Think you're going to jail for that.
That's the democratic.

464
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:31,080
Uh,
I liked her just because she at least

465
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,560
has built the deck,
not billing anymore,

466
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:35,910
man.
He's bill enough.

467
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,800
Bills stay.
He's,

468
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,760
he's kind of

469
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,530
the stand back and take naps in the
background guy.

470
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:45,860
Now if you noticed that there was a
speech he was giving,

471
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:48,760
he was falling asleep in the middle of
the speech and you know,

472
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,700
he just in really poor health,
apparently his body's just not doing so

473
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:53,534
well.

474
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,440
That's what happens when the blowjob
stop.

475
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,780
Wow.
You can't have fun anymore.

476
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,280
You just can't help yourself.
I mean,

477
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,570
it's true.
He was a machine back in the day and now

478
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,130
just came too much.
It's all dried out.

479
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,760
Hi.
Ya know,

480
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,520
just dried out to shut

481
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,610
so many loads.
Poor guy.

482
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,900
Um,
well he was a two term president.

483
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,000
I wouldn't say poor guy.
He was the best guy.

484
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:22,770
Made a mad run for it.
Mean regardless of all the Dick pulling

485
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:25,020
out and all that stuff.
He's a madman.

486
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,520
Would you expect from madman?
He's doing some mad man type shit.

487
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,320
All I remember is everybody was taking
vacations,

488
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:35,350
owning houses and gas prices were like
forty five cents a gallon.

489
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:36,041
Right?
So,

490
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,150
I mean he should.

491
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,870
I don't know enough.
I don't know enough about the economic

492
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,540
cycles,
but I do know that the people that are

493
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:47,230
smart that talk about it say that
there's like these upturns and downturns

494
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,340
that you can almost calculate that just
is going to happen and then we have a

495
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:54,880
weird economy and that these people that
are the experts,

496
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,080
they can kind of predict how things
start happening and deregulation moves

497
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:01,300
things along a little bit and this moves
things along.

498
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,400
Tax Incentive moves things a little
long,

499
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:06,280
a little further,
but then somewhere along the line the

500
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:08,770
house of cards comes falling down and
they,

501
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:12,580
um,
they see the big one was the mortgage

502
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:17,440
crisis of 2008.
We avoided an even bigger one with the

503
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:20,440
commercial real estate crisis.
There were,

504
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,740
there were saying that they were worried
about that more than anything because if

505
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:26,890
you drive down like any place in the
valley,

506
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,190
just go drive down the valley and look
at all the buildings for sale.

507
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,060
Look at all the buildings for lease.
It's,

508
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,490
it's way more than you used to say.
Like as you're driving down,

509
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:40,240
you see available for re release
available for sale,

510
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:41,470
available,
available,

511
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:43,960
available.
You see available like all over the

512
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,100
fucking place.
Like that

513
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,390
could fall apart too,
man.

514
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,200
Apparently that's a big one.
Apparently there's like a lot of people

515
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:54,470
that are like leveraging all these
commercial properties and moving things

516
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:56,000
around,
selling things here.

517
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,910
But there's a lot of vacant office shit.

518
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Well there's like this whole like flip
your house movement to,

519
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,290
you know,
in those channels.

520
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,210
Like when I'm at hotels and stuff,
he ended up,

521
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,350
I ended up sticking on it like that.
Like trying to convince everybody that

522
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:12,510
they can just go buy a house and flip it
and sell it.

523
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,310
Make money.
It's so easy.

524
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:15,280
Look,
he just come in,

525
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,000
tear down a wall and then sell it for
twice as much more.

526
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,730
Yeah.
Their character.

527
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,520
There's two,
right?

528
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,400
They're all like,
I'm going to do my own grout out there,

529
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,570
laying tiles and shit.

530
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,360
Right.
And then they edit it down and make it

531
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:29,350
look like it took 12 seconds on TV.
This old house,

532
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:31,090
you remember that.
That was one of my favorite shows

533
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:35,020
growing up with Bob Vila.
That's pretty much the original flipping

534
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:37,480
houses show,
but they made it a whole story on this

535
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,190
went on for days.
What happened to Bob Vila see alive?

536
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,230
That's a good question.
It is a good question.

537
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,230
I forgot about them like huge until he
was a hero.

538
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,990
Yeah.
This old house was done was like a giant

539
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:53,170
show,
or at least it was for me growing up

540
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:55,870
because we watched it every day.
That in the antique roadshow is another

541
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:59,400
one that had just love on pbs.
It was for me to still rocking.

542
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,780
That might be real 1 million followers.
It is.

543
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:03,580
Look it up.
Verified handsome bastard.

544
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,080
He looks exactly the senior AC coils
mean higher efficiency and lower energy

545
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:08,440
bills.

546
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,660
How clean are yours?
I just had that one of those air

547
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:15,220
conditioning's fucked me for life fucked
you because it has like a drain and it's

548
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,800
supposed to be tilted a little so it
could drip out.

549
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,650
Mine was dripping the other way,
like I didn't even know it was going

550
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,340
underneath my carpet,
so now it got underneath a to my wood

551
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:27,940
floors and now there's big buckles.
So when you walk it's like speed bumps

552
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:31,390
underneath my carpet and fun and there's
probably black mold in there and

553
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:34,780
probably go die.
Does that help with black mold is from

554
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:35,480
that,
right?

555
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,420
Like water,
it's

556
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,040
moisture from water damage,
but it has to be present,

557
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,930
you know,
and asked to be present and then it can

558
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,390
grow like a.
I know I'm,

559
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,200
well Tom Lucas was a big one because he
would talk about it on television or on

560
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:50,960
the radio rather like his,
his whole house had to be gutted,

561
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,570
like down to the studs that was in
Hollywood.

562
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,730
He's feeling like shit for years,
just like just health was poor,

563
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,460
just really didn't have any energy
trying to fill out what the fuck was

564
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,140
going on.
And um,

565
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,020
they brought in a black mold specialists
and they're like,

566
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:07,880
dude,
you're fucking houses infected.

567
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:13,390
So he's breathing in all these spores,
these black mold sports just being

568
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:15,230
poisoned all the time.

569
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,400
Did they have home tests for that?
I bet you anything.

570
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:20,160
I have so much black,
black matters people.

571
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,110
Fucking son of a bitch.
He's

572
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,860
got to keep an eye on it.

573
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,370
The jokes they come,
they just come.

574
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,750
Um,
yeah man.

575
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:33,950
I think um,
they,

576
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,980
they do a lot of testing for it.
You should probably get it checked out.

577
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,480
Some people have it,
man.

578
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,920
Do you ever ever seen one of Jim Norton?
Jim Norton was a gym and Bobby Jimmy and

579
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,010
Kelly lived in an

580
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,820
apartment and they had black mold on the
walls so bad that you would take the

581
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:49,740
picture off the wall and it was just
like,

582
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,230
you could see it all over behind the
picture.

583
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,400
It's probably isn't as common though in
Los Angeles since we're a desert and

584
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:57,930
everything's dry,
you know,

585
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,020
it's a good question.
I think if there's water,

586
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,810
like if you have water damage,
like say if you have a leaky pipe or

587
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:05,580
something like that for long periods of
time,

588
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:09,210
see that shit dripping down.
That's black mold juice hose lines.

589
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,280
Now Watch,
they pick up the uh,

590
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,530
it's um,
cribs.

591
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,820
Jim Norton is a,
if you want to find it as the video and

592
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:22,821
they say brace yourself so they push us
and the fucking wall is just covered

593
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:26,910
with black mold behind the photo.
I mean like someone spray painted all

594
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,280
over it.
I need a priest to come in and give an

595
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,600
extra systems of health.

596
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,150
How did it happen though?
Like what was you speaking?

597
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,830
They're slobs to fucking slobs.
Who knows?

598
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:37,410
Somebody might have come on that
picture.

599
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,210
You know,
it's Jim Norton.

600
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,570
Who the hell knows he's a savage.
Look at him playing chess.

601
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,240
Listen to cds.
That's pretty much your apartment.

602
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:50,241
Red Band Department.
Pretty much every comedian.

603
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,160
Ridiculous people.
Yeah.

604
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,590
That black molds.
No jokes.

605
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,250
Don't get it in your life.
Tony Hinchcliffe.

606
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,820
I keep an eye on all the black.
All the black mold.

607
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,283
Yeah.
It's um,

608
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,180
I don't think is there more than one
variety of black mold and does it have

609
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:09,810
to be like water damage for a long time?
Because I'm sure my carpet probably

610
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:10,770
dried out,
you know,

611
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:13,470
if I caught it could be,
could be.

612
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:15,000
I don't know enough.
I don't know enough.

613
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:15,920
I don't know,
you know,

614
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,710
I know,
uh,

615
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,190
that mold and spores thrive in moist
conditions,

616
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:22,860
you know,
like the forest but have no idea,

617
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:23,694
man.

618
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,590
It's creepy stuff.
That's creepy.

619
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,340
Yeah.
Fungus and mold and shit like that.

620
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,810
It's just so weird.
There's like these,

621
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,890
these lifeforms that live on life forms,
you know,

622
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,080
they like,
you leave her a pair,

623
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,330
leave it sitting around somewhere and
forget about it.

624
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,170
Come back in a couple of days and it's
got this little green civilization

625
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,940
growing on it.
Like who are you,

626
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,260
where'd you guys come from?
Like,

627
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:47,530
what are you doing here?
What would you.

628
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,460
Unlike the banana,
which has a skin that protects it from

629
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,980
these things because Jesus loves
bananas.

630
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,440
He gave him a southern accent and even
though he's from New Zealand,

631
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,780
interesting.
And it's interesting choice.

632
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,030
I hit a bunch of mold the other day late
at night and we bought strawberries,

633
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,850
you know,
like underneath the strawberry,

634
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,230
like green and stuff.
I had no idea because it was dark eating

635
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,610
strawberries and the next day I go in to
get some more and I'm like,

636
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:12,630
they're all moldy.
I'm like,

637
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,700
was I was reading moldy strawberry?
Yeah,

638
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:17,534
and the dark.
Yeah,

639
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,730
man.
It's probably not even that bad for you.

640
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,160
It's probably just all in your head.
I mean,

641
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,060
otherwise people would be dying left and
right,

642
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:25,660
right,
right.

643
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,910
Because everybody eats strawberries and
doesn't pay attention or blueberries.

644
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:32,820
Blueberries.
They always fucking mold on on cheese.

645
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,440
Sometimes blueberries have mold.
Right?

646
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,400
Right.
When you buy them,

647
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,750
you buy them and bring them home.
You're like,

648
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:37,980
fuck.
You're already molding.

649
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,800
Yeah.
Trader Joe's a lot of times cheese to

650
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,851
eat,
a slice of cheese.

651
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:42,100
Not even

652
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,480
realize half of it's white and green.
Well,

653
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,210
some cheeses to you,
Brian.

654
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,000
Nobody else is eating Greens.
Will.

655
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,840
What were you leaving your cheese?
Remember?

656
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:55,290
My mom would always say,
just pull off the mold part and just,

657
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,660
you know,
it's still good.

658
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,580
I would if that's true.
Yeah,

659
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,960
but pull the cheese out of the glove
compartment and screen you're eating it.

660
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,790
I just don't think that the economy

661
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,670
mold that we're talking about as toxic.
I just bet it's not like Jamie lookup

662
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,270
mold on strawberries.
Is it?

663
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:12,800
Oh,
Katie Moldy food.

664
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,950
What was it say?
May cause may have visible bacteria

665
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:18,960
along with the mold.
Yes,

666
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:20,830
some old cause,
allergic reactions,

667
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,470
respiratory problems,
and a few molds in the right conditions.

668
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:26,530
Produce Mycotoxins,
poisonous substances that can make you

669
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:28,030
sick.
Yeah.

670
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,200
Okay.
Just Google strawberries,

671
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,070
moldy strawberry.
Can you eat mostly

672
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,030
strawberries?
Google can Brian,

673
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:38,360
red bandy,
moldy stressing.

674
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,250
You've done something like this before
to think of your fruit had mold and it's

675
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,150
just like,
I just bought this also.

676
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:45,490
So have you ate mode?
Also,

677
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,200
Joe,
I'm sure I have

678
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,490
quick answer.
The most likely result of eating moldy

679
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:54,450
fruit is absolutely nothing unless the
person eating the mold is allergic.

680
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,640
However,
while the majority of molds are not

681
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:59,220
dangerous,
moldy fruit is more likely to be spoiled

682
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:03,420
and spoiled fruit may cause illness
because mold may form on fruit without

683
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:06,570
the fruit spoiling.
Simply cutting the moldy area off is

684
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:10,260
also a solution.
Most molds are not harmful,

685
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,760
somewhere even beneficial.
In fact,

686
00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:14,310
mold is actually a form of fungus
similar to mushrooms.

687
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,740
Mold grows and damp environments,
fruit skin,

688
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,151
blah,
blah,

689
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:18,481
blah,
blah,

690
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:18,821
blah,
blah,

691
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:20,200
blah.
Hmm.

692
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:23,890
Interesting.
I've always been scared of mold

693
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,110
fungus in general,
so freaky freaky organism because it's

694
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:34,111
not really a plant.
A fungus actually breathes in oxygen and

695
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:39,460
breathe out carbon dioxide and they say
it's closer to an animal that it is to a

696
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:43,990
plant in like what it is like what kind
of a being it is.

697
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,400
Very,
very bizarre.

698
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,650
Well,
a magic mushrooms does to the brain.

699
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:50,350
I mean there's definitely some stuff
going on there.

700
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,820
That's crazy.

701
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,390
Yeah.
That's what that feels like.

702
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,350
You're communicating with like a.
it's like you tap in through this

703
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:03,351
organism to this matrix of like,
not just like plant intelligence,

704
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,460
but the intelligence of the actual earth
itself.

705
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:13,440
It feels like almost like you're being
transmitted in a way where you can now

706
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:15,630
understand all these things that are
around you all the time,

707
00:32:15,631 --> 00:32:18,960
but they're muted because he just,
he just lacked the ability to perceive

708
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:20,280
them.
Like the earth itself.

709
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:22,080
Like we walk around and we're like,
wow,

710
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:24,630
so pretty today,
but do you really.

711
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,660
You don't really feel what the earth is
the way you feel it when you're on

712
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:30,930
mushrooms.
When you're on mushrooms,

713
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:34,770
you like,
you feel the actual grass as like a type

714
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:36,810
of an organism.
There's a thing like this,

715
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,240
that grass,
it stops like a couple of leaves and

716
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:45,410
some dirt and some it,
and then it becomes instead this feeling

717
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:48,620
like you're,
you're connected to this like almost

718
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,020
like a,
like a,

719
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,820
like a circuit,
you know,

720
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:54,470
like a biological circuit.

721
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,970
That's what like a beautiful thick lawn
feels like when you're on mushrooms,

722
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,090
like when you're standing in it,
you feel like you're connected to this

723
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:05,340
very strange life form.
That is what it is.

724
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,530
That's not even a hallucinatory sort of
a feeling,

725
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:14,531
but I think pretty much everybody that
that does any sort of psychedelic plant

726
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:16,730
based,
psychedelic mushrooms,

727
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,220
animal base,
whatever you want,

728
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,100
call it,
fungus based.

729
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,940
You reach these weird places where you
go,

730
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:25,190
okay,
my talking to that thing that I eat,

731
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:26,930
that thing that thing's talking to me
now.

732
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,240
Like is it,
is it communicating with me?

733
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:32,000
Threw me digesting it?
Is that what's happening?

734
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,790
Is it.
Let me go into some strange dimension

735
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,624
when I eat it.

736
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,470
It is amazing.
I miss this year shroom fest.

737
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,720
That's normally the one time a year
where I do it.

738
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,220
We go out in the desert,
but I had like,

739
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,770
I was on the road or something and I
miss it,

740
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:46,180
man.
I'm overdue for one.

741
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:49,510
Like it's like it'll be so connected to
the universe and you feel it.

742
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,703
You feel,
you know,

743
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,310
you just try to remember what happened.
Like you try to stay in that,

744
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,300
but it goes away and it's amazing
because like you're out in the desert or

745
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:01,570
at least that's where I normally do it
and you're looking at the rocks and the

746
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:06,571
moon and the stars are just beaming out
there and you'll feel,

747
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,490
you know,
is lost in the universe has ever.

748
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:11,680
And then all of a sudden you'll hear
like one of your buddies Fart,

749
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,870
you know,
come back and laughed for 20 minutes

750
00:34:13,871 --> 00:34:14,704
straight about it.

751
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,120
Yeah.
It's a very strange life form.

752
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,150
Very strange thing that you take into
your body that does that.

753
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,390
There's a gang of them too.
It's just so weird.

754
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,940
So I don't,
you know,

755
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,360
I don't,
I really don't know what's going on with

756
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:29,870
that.

757
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,510
Isn't it crazy that it comes from cow
poop?

758
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,230
Yeah.
Well that's where it grows,

759
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,350
but really come from it.
But it,

760
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:39,140
uh,
it grows really good on it because the,

761
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,970
uh,
the stomach of a cow against that double

762
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,160
onion,
you only make that stuff,

763
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,400
that manure.
It's just so rich for things to grow in

764
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:48,030
it.
So,

765
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:53,030
which I do the thing with my finger,
that's the kind of fucking we need to

766
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:58,740
grow these mushrooms.
Just a manure.

767
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,790
These counts your seat and Alfalfa all
day.

768
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,750
Alfalfa.
It's delicious.

769
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,890
Mushrooms grow.
When Duncan went to school,

770
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,080
Dunkin with the school and Super
Hippieville,

771
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,050
he uh,
he grew up in Asheville,

772
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:16,230
North Carolina,
which is a fucking great town.

773
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,800
Have you ever worked at Asheville?
Got to come with me to Asheville.

774
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,530
Asheville's fucking,
it's,

775
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,890
I almost don't want to tell people about
it because I don't want people moving

776
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:30,660
there and ruin it because it's like you
could walk around like it's a small town

777
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,420
but the people are cool as fuck.
Like,

778
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,800
and it's like a part of the community of
the College of the university and the

779
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:39,420
university,
super lefty,

780
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,900
super lefty,
like super hippies soup all like

781
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:47,190
Duncan's like living up there in the
mountains of North Carolina in like some

782
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:50,790
of the most beautiful landscape you're
ever going to see in your life.

783
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,610
Just out and out.
Amazing scenery,

784
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,810
incredible scenery.

785
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,280
And I love that.
There's still places like that.

786
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,510
Yeah,
like it's crazy.

787
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:02,730
Like my buddy little landy that the
glasses,

788
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,470
he's from South Carolina and he went
home to visit his family and he's

789
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:12,150
walking around the park with his mom and
Bill Murray is just sitting on a bench.

790
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,940
Where was this chillen wherever in South
Carolina where Bill Murray flips.

791
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,270
That's where he's from.
Two,

792
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,120
I thought Bill Murray

793
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,980
lived in like the up the upper,
uh,

794
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,110
on the what on the East River or one of
the rivers.

795
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,370
He lives like upstate New York.
Like there was a whole Anthony Bordain

796
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:32,080
episode about he lives like way the fuck
up.

797
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:34,750
They're up a river and maybe he was just
hanging out and because he lives in a

798
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:36,890
bunch of places.
Yeah.

799
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,890
Bill Marianthi.
Oh,

800
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,660
Charleston,
South Carolina.

801
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:41,494
Oh,
you know what?

802
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,200
That's right.
This was the new episode that he did.

803
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:48,610
He moved to a new place and Bill Murray
does not have a girlfriend.

804
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,451
He's like,
this dude.

805
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,140
He's like,
yeah,

806
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,180
I'll just be by myself.
Just leave me alone,

807
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:53,710
please.
We're just going to go have my life.

808
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,950
He did this interview about.
It was talking about.

809
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,510
I was like,
I'm not really interested in all that.

810
00:36:58,511 --> 00:36:59,350
Goes along with that.

811
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,880
He did it,
man.

812
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,130
He is the coolest ever.

813
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,420
He's a great,
great representative of cool.

814
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,460
The leader of the real ghost busters.
They killed him in the new movie.

815
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,300
The new ghostbusters movie.
They kill Bill Murray.

816
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,710
They can go kill themselves because I've
never watched it.

817
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,470
He's a bad guy.
I didn't really kill him.

818
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,340
He's a skeptic.
He.

819
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,150
It's like the whole thing.
It's very,

820
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,003
very.
What?

821
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,610
It's what it's like.
It's like what my point was about

822
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:36,310
Asheville is that there were so many
kids getting high off mushrooms off of

823
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,620
these cows because they're up in this
farm area and it's raining all the time

824
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:44,210
and everything's wet as fuck.
It's lush and green and these mushrooms

825
00:37:44,211 --> 00:37:49,211
just grew like weeds everywhere and it
was so bad that they had to give the

826
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:55,040
cows food,
that special food that made their,

827
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,970
their manure so that the mushrooms,
if they did grow in them,

828
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,440
they wouldn't be potent.

829
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,133
Yeah,
it wouldn't.

830
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,230
It wouldn't work.
I remember when we were in college would

831
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,660
go to certain places and get trash bags
worth of mushrooms because some areas

832
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,840
just because of the weather and the
farms and stuff like that,

833
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:16,250
it just grew mushrooms like crazy.
You've got to be so careful though with

834
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:17,750
mushrooms,
like what you're taking,

835
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,810
like if you think it's one kind of
mushroom,

836
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:24,230
but it's another kind of mushroom.
There's some mushrooms that'll kill you

837
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:28,010
in seconds.
That happened recently on this old folks

838
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:28,791
home.
These,

839
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:31,370
uh,
these old folks were hanging out and

840
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:34,350
this lady went out and gathered up.
Some mushrooms should probably out

841
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,010
fucking head on,
you

842
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,020
know,
what kind of Alzheimer's medicine or

843
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:40,900
anything they give them.
Like when you're in old folks homes,

844
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,270
dude,
they will throw some pills down your

845
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:44,110
throat.
Oh yeah.

846
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,600
Like you,
you get to choose how fucked up you want

847
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:51,580
to be all day and so there's ladies out
there picking mushrooms and just got a

848
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:54,100
gang of poison once,
cooked them all up for everybody to.

849
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,880
Everybody died.
Yeah.

850
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,123
Whoa.

851
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,680
She cooked him at the old folks' home.
Brought them back.

852
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:01,510
Yeah.
She cooked him for the old folks at the

853
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:03,970
old folks' home.
Just whack the whole crew.

854
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,420
Yeah.
I don't remember how many people died,

855
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:10,630
but it was more than one.
Do you hear about all these people dying

856
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:14,920
for elderly women die for people sick
and after eating white wild mushrooms.

857
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:18,460
Yeah.
So crazy shit here about all those

858
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:21,940
people dying from heroin overdoses
because there was a bad batch of heroin

859
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:26,870
in like Ohio or something and like 41
people I've overdosed on like the same

860
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,570
heroin.
I did hear about that.

861
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,510
I did hear about that.
No,

862
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,790
you hear about that.
What,

863
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,790
how do you say that stuff?
Cross home.

864
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,550
How do you say?
Keratome k r a t o,

865
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:37,510
m.
How do you say it?

866
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,620
Tony Kratom.
Kratom.

867
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:43,810
Maybe Kratom.
I don't know how to say it.

868
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,490
I've never said it,
but I've read about it a lot and uh,

869
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,900
it's uh,
a plant that helps people overcome

870
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:54,901
opioid addiction apparently.
And the FDA just moved into schedule one

871
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:58,810
or they're going to move it to schedule
one or the dea I should say.

872
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:00,190
I guess it's the Dea,
right?

873
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,900
But it's,
it's a plant

874
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,150
and apparently it helps a lot of people
that have a heroin addiction problems

875
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:11,200
and opiate addiction problems.
And even some people said it helps with

876
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,180
a marijuana,
not marijuana,

877
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:15,010
but alcohol withdrawals,
people,

878
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,920
alcoholics,
and they try to break free and get

879
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:19,840
sober.
This stuff can help with that too.

880
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,450
I don't know enough about it,
you know,

881
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,070
I'm going to,
I'm going to have someone on to talk

882
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,060
about it,
but it's just,

883
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,040
there's no need to make anything else
illegal like this,

884
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:32,380
this thing where they're doing what
they're doing is they're behaving like

885
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:33,670
an archaic society.

886
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,640
They're not behaving like America.
Two Thousand and 16,

887
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:41,050
they're behaving like the people who
enacted the very first sweeping

888
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,920
psychedelic laws of 1970.
They're behaving like they behave.

889
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,750
If you've got this plant,
this Kratom or however you say it,

890
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,740
and it doesn't have any history of
people like dropping dead from it,

891
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,440
it's not like some threat to the
communities.

892
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,820
It's not like this a terror that's
sweeping the streets and it's ruining

893
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:02,320
lives.
You're not hearing that.

894
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,500
All I'm hearing is it helps people with
heroin addiction.

895
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,810
We all know how many people are addicted
to heroin,

896
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,760
so the fact that they just want to step
in and immediately not just make this

897
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:17,320
like a schedule two or schedule three or
have some scientists come in and testify

898
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:21,190
about it and have some sort of public
hearings where they discuss the merits

899
00:41:21,191 --> 00:41:23,560
of keeping this drug legal and should
this be regulated?

900
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,620
Should it be prescribed by doctors like
reasonable adults would do if they

901
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:31,540
actually gave a fuck about each other,
but instead they have these fucking

902
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:36,930
ridiculous amounts of power where they
could just step in and just make things

903
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:41,390
illegal.
They have a ridiculous amount of power

904
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,380
when it comes to legislating what we can
and can't do with our bodies because

905
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:48,110
it's not something anybody's voting on
this kratom stuff.

906
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,890
So for the dea to just step in and make
that schedule one,

907
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,260
it's blasphemy like what they're doing
is a,

908
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,250
it's a.
it's such an abuse of the function of

909
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:00,680
the office.
The idea of the office is you're

910
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:03,430
supposed to be protecting people,
protect people from math,

911
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,870
protect people from bad ship.
Don't.

912
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:10,490
Don't let people come home to find their
children that have overdosed because

913
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,230
someone gave them bath salts,
right?

914
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,210
That's,
that's what everybody wants from

915
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:18,680
something like the dea,
but they're so far reaching with their

916
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:22,850
efforts that they step into all these
areas where we know you're full of shit.

917
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:27,200
Now you step in these areas like
marijuana or you're going to save people

918
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:30,770
from pot.
Congratulations you fucking cock

919
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:31,990
blocker.
What are you gonna?

920
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,680
Do you're gonna say people from giggling
or eating yummy food or having a good

921
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:37,680
time with their friends.
What are you going?

922
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,630
What are you?
What are you stopping?

923
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,510
These are.
This is not anything that we should

924
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:44,060
ever.
Not not anything we should ever asked

925
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,830
for from our leaders in quotes,
and definitely not anything we should

926
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,890
ever tolerate for no reason whatsoever.
There's no reason whatsoever why they

927
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:54,640
would keep marijuana illegal.
There's no reason whatsoever other,

928
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,050
whether it would make this kratom stuff
scheduled ones.

929
00:42:57,051 --> 00:42:58,640
There's no fucking reason.
It's money.

930
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,600
It's.
It is.

931
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,650
It's a sure sign that it's a corrupt
system and if that,

932
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,660
if that kratom stuff helps with alcohol
withdrawals,

933
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:10,661
then you got to know that these big
companies would.

934
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,610
Why wouldn't they pitched them some
money to be like,

935
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:15,740
hey,
lets you don't want me drinking.

936
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:20,660
Even if they didn't do it blatantly,
even if they didn't do a blatantly,

937
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,590
if they're entangled with each other,
you can best believe that if you were

938
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:27,020
entangled with some sort of an alcohol
company,

939
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,920
you're going to do your best to maximize
the profits of that alcohol company.

940
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,540
Right?
I mean it's just the way it is.

941
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:37,490
If you're entangled with some donor to
some political campaign or some some

942
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,780
foundation that you run and they give
millions of dollars,

943
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:44,450
like you guys have a little agreement
going on there.

944
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,150
You don't have to even say it.
You don't have to have it written down.

945
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,300
You don't have to be stupid about it,
but it's pretty obvious.

946
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:52,760
If someone gives you millions of bucks
there,

947
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:55,400
you know you guys are how your guys are
doing business.

948
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,910
Something's happening here,
you know you're to do nice things for

949
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:02,780
each other now and that's,
that's where a lot of this shit comes

950
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:05,690
from.
Like the fact that we,

951
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,660
the people,
the people that are supposed to be

952
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:13,661
represented by these clowns can sit back
and just be frustrated and not do

953
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:16,340
anything.
We could vote for it when it comes up in

954
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:18,980
our states,
but federally it's a giant issue.

955
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:22,400
Federally,
federally is the real problem because

956
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:26,150
there's a bunch of states now that made
it illegal including Washington dc.

957
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:28,740
It's a bunch of states that have made
pot legal there.

958
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,331
They're like,
look,

959
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:31,990
it's ridiculous.
Doesn't the science and Fit p?

960
00:44:31,991 --> 00:44:34,920
And then they start taxing it and then
they make unbelievable amounts of money

961
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:37,920
and then they have massive research that
says in their economy like you're seeing

962
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:41,370
in Colorado and now you're seeing in
Seattle in Washington state as well.

963
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,650
What they're doing is they're.
They're being ironical like these.

964
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:49,260
These,
this is not like reasonable people

965
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:54,261
acting in a reasonable way that they're
locking people up for a long time.

966
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,030
Oh my God.
There was this fucking thing the other

967
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:00,450
day where they were comparing that kid
who raped the girl in.

968
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,510
What University was that?
Who's got like a ridiculously short

969
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:05,670
amount of time?
What's that?

970
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:08,260
You don't have a mic on Stanford.
Stanford.

971
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,320
Is that what it is?
That guy.

972
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,610
So they compared that guy to some poor
bastard that.

973
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,040
Oh my God,
I think he got 30 years for growing pot.

974
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,510
Did you see that picture?
Did you see it too?

975
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,130
I think it was even longer than 30
years,

976
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,390
man.
It might've been.

977
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,920
It might've been like 30 to life or
something,

978
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:33,090
but it's just the idea that you would
lock that guy away for that long for

979
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:37,950
something so fucking innocuous will loan
book below the law.

980
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,060
It's real simple.
We got a law and you don't want to break

981
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,913
it.
Okay.

982
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,210
You took your consequences.
We're adults here.

983
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,860
We're all adults.
These laws are stupid.

984
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:50,010
We're being handicapped by these ancient
systems,

985
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,260
these ancient systems of control.
They don't.

986
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:55,530
They're not valid anymore.
You can't just lock people up for pot.

987
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,630
It's stupid.
Here it is.

988
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,090
Lee.
Carol Brooker,

989
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,990
a 75 year old veteran,
served a life sentence in prison without

990
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:07,860
parole for being caught growing three
dozen marijuana plants behind my son's

991
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:08,694
house.
Wow.

992
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,560
Oh my God.
And it says,

993
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:11,580
hi.
I'm Brock Turner,

994
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,210
20 year old who raped a woman on campus.
I just got six months in prison.

995
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,020
I'm also promised that with good
behavior that would be cut down to three

996
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:20,970
months.
Jesus Christ.

997
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:21,970
Wow.
Yeah.

998
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,790
He's already out and there's like a
armed protestors outside of his house.

999
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,870
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1000
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:30,520
I'm so rape before joint skies.
Yeah.

1001
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,360
No,
that's just crazy.

1002
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,150
If you're going to rape a girl,
don't do it on a pile of marijuana

1003
00:46:35,151 --> 00:46:36,920
plants.
That's what we learned here.

1004
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,710
That'd be a good idea.
Plus three months.

1005
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,161
Good.
Pardon?

1006
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:44,120
From Obama.
I think

1007
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,390
that guy.
Yes,

1008
00:46:46,391 --> 00:46:48,910
but Ken Obama,
like reverse the sentence and put that

1009
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:51,910
kid back in jail.
But the rapist back in jail.

1010
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,190
Did He.
Did he admit to doing it?

1011
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,310
I think I didn't they.
It was one of those things.

1012
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:00,500
I think we're like,
she got drunk,

1013
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:03,500
she fell asleep and he banged her while
she was out cold.

1014
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,270
Yeah,
I think so.

1015
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,920
What is it behind a dumpster though?
Yeah,

1016
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,100
that's right.
Oh,

1017
00:47:07,101 --> 00:47:07,940
that's the one,
right?

1018
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,660
Yeah.
I passed out behind a dumpster.

1019
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,270
God Damn.
That's like heard of that,

1020
00:47:14,271 --> 00:47:15,440
but I've never actually,
you know,

1021
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,620
I didn't realize people actually could
pass up 100 dumpster.

1022
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,100
Like I've never been that drunk to where
that's where I would lay down.

1023
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,530
I fucked by a dumpster but never slept
there.

1024
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,860
He fucked by a dumpster,
a dumpster grease on the ground.

1025
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,830
Now.
Slippery boxes down.

1026
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:30,280
But

1027
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,610
Oh my God,
what a classy girl you must been.

1028
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,690
I told you about this and the guy came
out and he caught us having sex and he's

1029
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,330
like,
oh,

1030
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,150
you got nervous.
He's like,

1031
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,370
Oh,
you guys want some pizza?

1032
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,460
Because he thought we were homeless.
Homeless Bank too.

1033
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,000
Homeless People Bang on pizza boxes next
to dumpsters.

1034
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:46,930
That's pretty much it.

1035
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,320
There's this homeless guy that lives by
or lives on the bench outside my

1036
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:56,060
starbucks and then he has gang green or
diabetes or something so bad that his

1037
00:47:56,061 --> 00:48:01,061
legs are just like purple and black and
I was behind him in starbucks walking in

1038
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,480
and every time you took a step like this
open sore but just like squirt blood on

1039
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:08,520
the floor of star.
It was the grossest thing in there in

1040
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,400
the world.
What did he get to drink?

1041
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,010
I don't want to waters.
He thought he was taking a bath or

1042
00:48:13,011 --> 00:48:15,020
something.
But yeah,

1043
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:17,090
that's a problem.
If you're running a business and that

1044
00:48:17,091 --> 00:48:18,920
guy walks in,
what do you do?

1045
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:23,240
They're super nice to him too because
he's there every day just sleeping on

1046
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:24,830
the bench.
The homeless thing is weird,

1047
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,210
right?
Because those are people.

1048
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,200
They are people but goddamn they stink,
you know?

1049
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,360
And it's like when they're around you,
they're,

1050
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,970
they're reaching their hands out.
Like if you run into one of them cookie

1051
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:38,070
homeless people that doesn't bathe ever.
And then you know,

1052
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,750
they have like those dirty caked feet
and they're wandering around.

1053
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,240
What I see is like a mentally ill
person,

1054
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,370
you know,
what I see is like a failure of the

1055
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:49,280
healthcare system or like how do you
just let this person wander around like

1056
00:48:49,281 --> 00:48:51,050
this.
Like this is like they're having

1057
00:48:51,051 --> 00:48:54,380
conversations with themselves and
rummaging through their fucking shopping

1058
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:54,880
cart.

1059
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,540
It's a very serious problem in La.
The other day I saw something gross

1060
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:01,330
right in my neighborhood.
Like right at my intersection,

1061
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,390
I saw a homeless lady sitting on a bus
bench and it looked like she was

1062
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:10,810
wiggling her pants down a little bit.
She did and she's just sitting on the

1063
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:12,520
bench and you know,
it has those greats.

1064
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:17,350
It's not just like a solid bench.
It goes through and she paid just

1065
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:19,480
through right through the greats.
Like it was nothing.

1066
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,540
Just p flying out of her,
oh my God.

1067
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:26,860
And I couldn't stop watching.
All of a sudden I'm just like,

1068
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:29,670
you know,
it's amazing because you're,

1069
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,680
you're looking at the amount of Pii
that's coming out of this human being.

1070
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,390
This guy sad

1071
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,570
because we just leave those people out
there and I think this guy's a vet.

1072
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:41,680
Like that's what's even crazier that he
fought for us and now he can't get

1073
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,980
medical attention for free.
You know,

1074
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,530
it's also,
some of them you have to think probably

1075
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:49,720
just left.
They didn't want to deal with the

1076
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:51,790
healthcare system.
They didn't want to be medicated all the

1077
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:54,280
time.
They didn't want to stay in a loony bin.

1078
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:57,940
But then there was like Rayon during the
Reagan administration that they let them

1079
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:00,820
loose on the streets like zombies.
They changed the,

1080
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:03,160
uh,
whatever the standard of treatment,

1081
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,100
like,
you know,

1082
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,040
had to treat someone if they're x amount
of crazy like that,

1083
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:10,240
you're on your own crazy flux and they
just pushed them out into the street and

1084
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:12,280
there was just an influx of homeless
people.

1085
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:14,780
You find them all over the east coast.
It was,

1086
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,080
it was real weird.
It was a big problem.

1087
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:19,570
I remember that.
I think San Francisco,

1088
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,740
it was a big deal up there.
It's a real big deal in places like

1089
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:26,260
Boston.
That's where homelessness is a big deal

1090
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,690
because when they're out there they can
fucking free solid.

1091
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,120
You can die out there.

1092
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,620
I was uh,
I was with Jeff Ross when he taped his

1093
00:50:35,621 --> 00:50:40,180
special roast,
the police where we did ride alongs with

1094
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:45,181
the Boston police department during the
winter and these cops,

1095
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,680
they know all the homeless people,
every single one of them and they show

1096
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:51,670
genuine concern and like,
you know,

1097
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,520
that they have to go up to these guys
and be like,

1098
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:55,420
Yo,
the shelter,

1099
00:50:55,421 --> 00:50:56,410
it's open,
you know,

1100
00:50:56,411 --> 00:50:58,810
get in there.
It's a whole thing.

1101
00:50:59,100 --> 00:50:59,540
Like,
it's,

1102
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,470
that's actually during the winter time,
one of their main things,

1103
00:51:02,471 --> 00:51:04,060
and this is when all the,
you know,

1104
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,580
obviously there's been a cop shootings
and this and that,

1105
00:51:06,581 --> 00:51:09,190
but their main concern for the most
part,

1106
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:13,810
what we did on these ride alongs was
tell homeless people to get to the

1107
00:51:13,811 --> 00:51:16,450
shelter.
They're just going to freeze.

1108
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,050
It's pretty much what Boston cops are
doing during the winter unless there's a

1109
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:20,884
crazy call.

1110
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,340
It's just a,
such a sad aspect of our society,

1111
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:28,430
like the people that are just,
it's just for whatever reason,

1112
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:30,650
whether it's a mental issue just doesn't
click.

1113
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,210
There's just something that's not
clicking in there.

1114
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:34,390
Right.
And then just wandering around through

1115
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,990
the streets and there's no one with
them,

1116
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,630
you know,
and they're just living in this strange

1117
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:42,320
life.
I always wonder like what is reality to

1118
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:42,890
those people?

1119
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,170
I was just going to say,
I always wonder what they're thinking.

1120
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:47,690
Like sometimes it seems like they're
having so much fun.

1121
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,420
Do you remember that Robin Williams
movie?

1122
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:55,140
Robin Williams played a crazy homeless
guy that lives in central park and used

1123
00:51:55,141 --> 00:51:57,010
to think he was a night or something
like that.

1124
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,200
Oh yeah.
What the fuck was that movie?

1125
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:04,630
It was like a mental illness movie was a
movie about a Fisher King.

1126
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,860
The Fisher King.
Yeah.

1127
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,900
Robin Williams was completely out of his
mind

1128
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,720
and he played this really I,
if I,

1129
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,720
if there is that,
I believe that's the plot of the movie.

1130
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,950
I hope we're not fucking it up,
but that was the thing is that this guy

1131
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:20,480
was seeing some things that just weren't
there.

1132
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,260
I mean obviously when you see those
people talk to themselves or something

1133
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:25,760
going on there.
Yeah.

1134
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:28,760
I wonder what it's like,
what if it's like the simpsons ride at

1135
00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:30,770
universal,
like everything they see is like,

1136
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:33,050
whoa,
hey,

1137
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:37,370
I like to think that they're smarter
than us and they like talking to people

1138
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:39,560
that they can see that are actually
there,

1139
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:41,960
but we are.
We can't figure it out.

1140
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,320
A former radio DJ suicidally despondent
because of terrible mistakes he made,

1141
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,280
finds redemption in helping a deranged
homeless man who was an unwitting victim

1142
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:53,880
of that mistake.
Huh?

1143
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,930
I don't remember much about this movie.

1144
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,020
Suicidally.
Despondent.

1145
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,460
Crazy,
right?

1146
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,100
Yeah.
Have you ever written that a simpsons

1147
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:10,060
ride at universal now?
Drop everything I have with the shooting

1148
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:10,781
one,
right?

1149
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:11,840
You like shoot?
No,

1150
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,341
no,
no,

1151
00:53:12,341 --> 00:53:15,280
no.
The simpsons ride like you sit in like a

1152
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,200
car,
but it's sort of like everything is

1153
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:19,480
happening.
The car moves around a little bit left

1154
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:21,310
and right,
but everything that's happening is

1155
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,240
happening on the screen in front of you
like the screen,

1156
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,580
this gigantic

1157
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:30,990
high def screen where you're in a first
person perspective and you know it's

1158
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:35,991
taking on this wild,
crazy fucking amazingly illustrated

1159
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,870
cartoon rot.
It's fucking fun,

1160
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:41,190
Dude.
It's really fun.

1161
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,740
Scott.
Smells to remember the baby powder smell

1162
00:53:43,741 --> 00:53:45,600
and it smells like when Maggie's on the
screen.

1163
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,700
It's one of the best rides ever.

1164
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,130
It's so good.
I was really surprised at the

1165
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:52,650
transformers ride too.
Is that good kids?

1166
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:53,910
Great.
And work for a minute.

1167
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:55,220
I was on that one.
I didn't like it.

1168
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,320
Really thought it was like,
whoa.

1169
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,360
I will extend with the simpsons first.
Yeah.

1170
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:01,740
Not to move.

1171
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,480
Mentioned that Harry Potter thing yet at
the Harry Potter rides.

1172
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:05,560
Amazing.
So weird.

1173
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:08,350
Because I live next to universal and
you're just driving and now there's a

1174
00:54:08,351 --> 00:54:09,930
castle that you just drive.
I'm like,

1175
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:11,380
why is Eric?
Oh yeah,

1176
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:12,630
Harry Potter.
It's cool.

1177
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,900
It's a long ass ride to the Harry Potter
ride is really long.

1178
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,190
I don't know how long it takes,
but you're like,

1179
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:19,720
Whoa,
this is ride keeps going.

1180
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,950
How do you go to university?
You go when it's closed or something.

1181
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,020
Just go.
Whatever.

1182
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:25,883
It was.
Just go.

1183
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:31,130
That place is crazy for anybody.
I can't imagine what it's like for you

1184
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:36,390
on.
We'll just go where this guy definitely

1185
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:38,170
not rocking your fanny pack at
university.

1186
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,960
My fanny pack there.
Heck yeah,

1187
00:54:39,961 --> 00:54:42,900
that's the best place to wear it.
How dare you say I want.

1188
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,270
They just want my family back at
Disneyland.

1189
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,580
Get swamped.
Just say hi to people.

1190
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,050
Say Hi and keep moving.
Yeah.

1191
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,880
Did you talk about this George Carlin's
cd that are uh,

1192
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,280
that he recorded the day before nine
slash 11?

1193
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:57,540
No.
Have you heard about this?

1194
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,690
He recorded a special the day before
nine slash 11.

1195
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,630
It was actually called.
I kinda like it when a lot of people

1196
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:05,160
die.
Oh No.

1197
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,650
And then the following day,
nine slash 11 happened.

1198
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:12,120
So they had to shelve it and I guess
even in it he talks about Osama bin

1199
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,160
Ladin Holy Shit,
Shit like that.

1200
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,190
And so there were about to release it or
they just released it.

1201
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,980
They've held onto it this long is
because of nine slash 11.

1202
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,573
It's really creepy.

1203
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,720
A bunch of weird nine slash 11,
things like that.

1204
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:26,870
I looked up,
I found a couple yesterday actually it

1205
00:55:26,871 --> 00:55:29,240
was like a,
there's a band that was called.

1206
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:32,420
We are the World Trade Center.
I am the World Trade Center.

1207
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:37,340
It was like a synth pop band in April of
2001.

1208
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,220
They released a song again,
the name of the band.

1209
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:45,250
We are the World Trade Center and track
11 on that album that came out in April.

1210
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:52,100
Track 11 was called September.
So like if you look at their albums near

1211
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,980
the World Trade Center,
11 dot September,

1212
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,570
that's crazy.
So insane.

1213
00:55:56,571 --> 00:55:57,130
And then there's

1214
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:57,963
another thing.

1215
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,420
Then there's another thing I can't
remember which cartoon and it's either

1216
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:03,490
like Futurama,
I think it is,

1217
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,300
but it's the craziest thing I saw in a
long time in one of these weird

1218
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:10,930
cartoons.
There was a moment where it pans over

1219
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:13,840
from them and there's a movie poster on
the wall and it.

1220
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,960
And this was before nine slash 11,
like right before nine slash 11.

1221
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,340
And it looks like a World Trade Center
smoking like blatantly.

1222
00:56:21,341 --> 00:56:23,740
Exactly like a world trade center fire.

1223
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,240
There you go.
And um,

1224
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,720
it says coming soon on the thing,
like a movie poster just says coming

1225
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,210
soon.
And they're blatantly a world trade

1226
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:37,780
center smoking.
It's the craziest thing I've seen in a

1227
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:38,700
long time.
I think it's either.

1228
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:39,723
Futurama,

1229
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,150
I think though,
as much content as people put out and

1230
00:56:42,151 --> 00:56:45,330
the World Trade Center was always these
iconic references.

1231
00:56:45,331 --> 00:56:47,070
I mean it was in a Biggie Song,
you know,

1232
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,050
blow up like the world trade.
Yeah.

1233
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:49,990
You know,
cover.

1234
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,440
Yeah.
And those people did try to blow it up

1235
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,900
in,
was it like 96 or something like that?

1236
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,970
They,
they blew up that car bomb inside the

1237
00:56:56,971 --> 00:57:00,120
basement.
So it makes sense that somebody would

1238
00:57:00,121 --> 00:57:02,250
have caught it.
But that 11 and September,

1239
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:03,730
that's bananas.
Yeah.

1240
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,940
That's some fucking premonition shit

1241
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:09,980
it happened.
You think they planned that?

1242
00:57:09,981 --> 00:57:12,380
Like that,
like knowing that nine slash 11 not but

1243
00:57:12,381 --> 00:57:14,490
like knowing that if we do it on nine
slash 11,

1244
00:57:14,491 --> 00:57:17,120
it's nine slash 11.
It's like emergency numbers,

1245
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,620
marketing one on one.
It was easier,

1246
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:20,030
you know,
they knew it was going to be a bigger

1247
00:57:20,031 --> 00:57:23,180
deal because it's 9:11,
nine slash 11,

1248
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,160
you know the maybe

1249
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,430
yeah,
maybe it would have happened in nine

1250
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:33,431
slash 12 and been just as fucked up and
people find reasons to attach numbers in

1251
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:38,300
meanings to things,
but it's totally possible that they know

1252
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:38,901
are.
I mean,

1253
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:41,000
obviously they know nine slash 11 is for
emergency,

1254
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,980
that they did it on nine slash 11
because of that,

1255
00:57:42,981 --> 00:57:45,020
but would have made any difference.
It was nine,

1256
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:46,940
nine or 9:10.
It was.

1257
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:50,930
It was a devastating attack and tragedy.
The other stuff is just like,

1258
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:51,710
really?

1259
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,800
If they did it on July 11th,
seven slash 11 would have gone out of

1260
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:56,870
business everywhere.
Seven.

1261
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,700
Sorry.
Were you going with that?

1262
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,460
If there's going to be more to this,
that's it.

1263
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,000
But like thinking about that,
about people for seven,

1264
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:07,890
11 July fourth will be a big smack in
our face and march would be really good

1265
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:10,460
if it was March 11th at 3:11.

1266
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,140
Oh,
that,

1267
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,320
that band?
Yeah.

1268
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,880
They make good weed pens.
Yeah,

1269
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:17,950
they do.
Just one of the first people to smoke

1270
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:20,680
the prototype last year on the 3:11
crews with peanut.

1271
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:22,120
The Bass player.
How strong is that,

1272
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:23,590
Ben?
They make their own weed pens.

1273
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,860
It's a very strong move.
They're the coolest man.

1274
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,170
They have,
like they've always been ahead of the

1275
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:30,580
game.
Live show.

1276
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,450
It's because they're all generic.
Uh,

1277
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:33,960
like Chinese,
you know,

1278
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,400
models.
So anyone can make their own weed pen by

1279
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:39,040
just putting a logo on it.
You can buy them in bulk.

1280
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,510
Yeah,
I've seen all the same.

1281
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,730
We'd pins you can go to.
There's this website you can buy like

1282
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,820
300 of them and they'll even like put a
logo on it for you.

1283
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:47,520
So it looks like your we'd pin.
They were red.

1284
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,290
They were really hands on with this one
though.

1285
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:53,830
This they like tried out a ton of.
I know because he told us all about it

1286
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,650
but that would just be like the oil.
So they tried out a ton of canisters to.

1287
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,320
I just know that it took them like they
should,

1288
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:04,020
like they went through a long process.
So probably both.

1289
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,760
It's good stuff comes up.
A highly approved.

1290
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,840
You try the orange one.
I don't know what one I tried.

1291
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,650
That's what I remember is it tasted like
an actual orange and got me correct.

1292
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:14,940
Yeah.
No that's good stuff.

1293
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:20,080
Atheist's nightmare acs night man.
It's this.

1294
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:22,070
Well it

1295
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:26,040
is intelligent design though.
Somebody made it there.

1296
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,060
Um,
those bands also.

1297
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,840
Like what kind of band is three?
One,

1298
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:30,470
one,

1299
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,620
three,
11 is really their own type of thing

1300
00:59:33,621 --> 00:59:36,710
because it's like ray gay mixed with
heavy rock,

1301
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:38,780
like they go back and forth.
Sometimes it's,

1302
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:42,470
sometimes you'll just forget that
they're about to like drop.

1303
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,010
Like they have killer guitarist and high
energy.

1304
00:59:46,011 --> 00:59:49,370
They have two lead singers,
one guy with a really smooth voice and

1305
00:59:49,371 --> 00:59:52,770
the other guys sorta like a rapper do
all this while they're high.

1306
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:53,803
Alright.
Oh,

1307
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,360
I'd imagine so.
But also like,

1308
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:57,950
I feel like a couple of days,
I feel like a lot of those guys have

1309
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,850
families now and stuff and uh,
they might calm down a little bit,

1310
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:04,520
but I'm sure they,
they have to get stoned.

1311
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:07,430
I used to like them.
I haven't heard anything from them in a

1312
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:09,800
long time.
Well they made a greatest hits album way

1313
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:12,680
back in like 98 or something like that.
You know,

1314
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,820
that they are,
they are notorious for being one of the

1315
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:21,821
best live bands to see if there's a
whole cruise ship with them.

1316
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:22,940
Right?
Yeah.

1317
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,790
It was the coolest thing I've ever done.
Thought it was about,

1318
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,410
uh,
it was actually five days.

1319
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,510
I did two shows and I was like shaky
about it because this was back when like

1320
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,580
that,
like toilets exploded on that one cruise

1321
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:35,690
or whatever.
Everybody died.

1322
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:37,790
Well,
everybody is freaking out.

1323
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:38,080
It's like

1324
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,640
one where the guy was trying to wave.
His girlfriend came around with the boat

1325
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:42,520
and then he,
uh,

1326
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,840
hit the ground and killed like a ton of
people.

1327
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,130
Bunch of people.

1328
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:48,740
I'm talking about carnival one that
like,

1329
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:50,270
got all poopy everywhere.
Oh,

1330
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,080
that one too.
Yeah,

1331
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,030
I remember that.
That happened right around then and I'm

1332
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:53,631
like,
man,

1333
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,660
I cruise ship we're going to see.
But I knew three slash 11 was an awesome

1334
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:59,600
life band like I did out of.
I've seen them actually quite a few

1335
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:01,100
times.
Like in high school and stuff,

1336
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,953
dude,
there's a railing

1337
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:04,850
below that railing is the ocean and
you're going 50 miles an hour.

1338
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,260
Good luck.

1339
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,060
It's awesome.
Fuck you.

1340
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:10,420
I had so much fun because they're
performing on the main deck.

1341
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,170
Fun cruises.
I agree.

1342
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,030
Fuck cruises.
So tell me what it was like.

1343
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,520
It was the greatest thing ever.
I came back from that five day cruise

1344
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:24,521
and got everything in my life done like
crazy because it's so.

1345
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:30,430
It's literally perfect.
Going to Jamaica on the most boring part

1346
01:01:30,431 --> 01:01:34,210
of the whole trip was the half a day we
spent in Jamaica before getting back on

1347
01:01:34,211 --> 01:01:36,160
and going,
I stepped on some needle.

1348
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:38,620
These sponge in the ocean like,
this sucks.

1349
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:42,220
Get back on this luxury cruise ship.
A bunch of shows going on.

1350
01:01:42,221 --> 01:01:45,310
There's a casino you can get away to
your room if you want to disappear.

1351
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:49,480
It's really a thousand times better than
I thought it was going to be.

1352
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:53,170
If you didn't like Jamaica.
Now it's now

1353
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:55,391
good.
God.

1354
01:01:55,391 --> 01:01:58,160
No.
Well I'll go ahead and try the chicken.

1355
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,540
It was like just bad.
Everybody's cooking and it's just dirty.

1356
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:05,230
There's bees everywhere in nature like
sucks,

1357
01:02:05,231 --> 01:02:07,830
but cruise ships are great because it's
like a fake name.

1358
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:14,310
Going 50 miles an hour with Caribbean
era around you is perfect.

1359
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:17,380
I mean it's the perfect life.

1360
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,560
Oh,
you're going to live on boat when you're

1361
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:20,130
an old crazy

1362
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,240
man.
You're.

1363
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,400
Are you going to be like one of them?
Howard Hughes type dudes?

1364
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,430
Just out on a boat,
just John Hubbard style with your own

1365
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:28,740
captain's outfit,
who give yourself metals every year.

1366
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:32,580
Highs for a new job today I'm want to
get myself a metal pin.

1367
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:35,100
A metal onto your.
You would have like a camel colored

1368
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:36,630
coat.
Maybe a light camel.

1369
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:37,980
Something sophisticated.
Yeah,

1370
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,320
probably.
Well my older brother just got like way

1371
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:43,080
in way into it.
Bought a boat and everything and he's

1372
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:46,140
been sailing for like a decade,
but he's like way into it now.

1373
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,000
Yeah.
He's got a cool apartment right on

1374
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:50,940
Venice beach and a boat and the dock.
So he just goes blah,

1375
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,281
blah,
blah,

1376
01:02:51,281 --> 01:02:52,050
blah,
blah.

1377
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,310
Well,
I'm going to go into the ocean.

1378
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:56,690
It makes sense.
I mean it's like a giant uncharted area

1379
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,290
or a an a on.
There's no roads.

1380
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,870
There's no like you can go wherever you
want.

1381
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,210
Like that's the cool thing about like
being in the ocean.

1382
01:03:05,211 --> 01:03:07,250
If you have a boat,
there's no road.

1383
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,570
There's no one.
You have to go here.

1384
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:11,210
You have to take a right there and you
take the 1:10 to the 18th.

1385
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:12,241
No,
no.

1386
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:14,000
Let's just go wherever you want to go.
What do you want to go?

1387
01:03:14,001 --> 01:03:16,150
You want to go to Catalina?
Go to Catalina.

1388
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,690
It's crazy.
Life under there.

1389
01:03:17,691 --> 01:03:19,830
You throw a fishing pole out to catch
something.

1390
01:03:19,831 --> 01:03:22,350
You throw it on the grill right there.
You just scan it.

1391
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,830
Pam.
Don't even have to get up or down.

1392
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,120
You know?
They're finding out that a lot of those

1393
01:03:28,121 --> 01:03:31,660
tropical fish are making their ways into
the waters around southern California

1394
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,430
because of the global warming,
so they're having like yellowfin tuna or

1395
01:03:36,431 --> 01:03:38,740
all over southern California.
Water's.

1396
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:41,620
We used to have to go to like Hawaii to
catch those things so we can catch them

1397
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:43,750
right here now.
That's awesome.

1398
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:44,710
Getting your boats on.

1399
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,230
Then the cruise ship thing.
I'm telling you.

1400
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,570
I mean it's a.
it's a whole thing,

1401
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,630
but what if someone's really annoying?
They just fall.

1402
01:03:52,631 --> 01:03:54,380
You were on that cruise ship.
That doesn't happen.

1403
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:56,000
Stuck on them.
It doesn't happen now.

1404
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:57,800
You can lose them.
You could lose him.

1405
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:01,790
Did you have a huge.
You have to understand how huge this is.

1406
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,890
Like a mall.
It's like a small city.

1407
01:04:03,891 --> 01:04:07,160
Yes.
It's like a giant mall or a small city.

1408
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:11,210
How long does it take to walk around?
Was also like six or seven floors.

1409
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,820
You know what I mean?
So boom,

1410
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:13,650
boom,
boom.

1411
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:16,760
That's what it's all like a hotel.
Almost like a Vegas hotel.

1412
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:18,410
It's floating.
That's what it's like.

1413
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:20,810
It's like a vegas style.
Huge hotel.

1414
01:04:20,811 --> 01:04:24,290
Like how the mgms connected to the New
York,

1415
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:28,370
New York or whatever.
It's like super duper huge and the main

1416
01:04:28,371 --> 01:04:30,650
deck,
I mean they're doing shows at nighttime

1417
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:36,040
and it is unbelievable going to a normal
concert where you're just not moving

1418
01:04:36,711 --> 01:04:37,790
after that.
Sort of like,

1419
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,470
I'm missing something here.

1420
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:44,230
They must have cruises that go
successfully every day to their

1421
01:04:44,231 --> 01:04:46,000
destination.
Smooth.

1422
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,850
Everyone has a great experience.
There is no issues whatsoever.

1423
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:53,040
It's like airplanes.
All it takes is one poopy mistakes.

1424
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,210
There's one dude who wants a wave at his
girlfriend and beaches the boat and

1425
01:04:58,211 --> 01:05:03,211
drowned a bunch of people or one husband
who throws his wife over the side to

1426
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:07,900
hear about that guy.
There was a guy who through his wife

1427
01:05:07,901 --> 01:05:12,901
over the side like newlyweds.
There's some fucking creepy people out

1428
01:05:14,021 --> 01:05:14,590
there,
man.

1429
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:18,100
There's a cruise ship website like
cruise ship reports.org

1430
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,530
or something like that and it tells you
every time there's a problem with a

1431
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:22,990
cruise ship and it's shocking how many
there are.

1432
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,880
There's like problems all the time and
like,

1433
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:28,630
and it shows how many people died and
stuff and why and how and how often do

1434
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:31,120
people die from cruise.
Crazy shit happens on cruise.

1435
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:32,380
Like you sold the elevator,
right?

1436
01:05:32,381 --> 01:05:35,350
The guy that got stuck in the elevator
and it started dripping down blood of

1437
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:40,060
his body because he got crushed on the,
on the cruise ship in a couple months

1438
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,470
ago,
dripping down black.

1439
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,530
This guy working on an elevator and the
elevator crushed them.

1440
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:48,040
And so he was working on the elevator
and went up to the top and then.

1441
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:51,970
So there's video of just blood gushing
down the elevator door and people are

1442
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:53,110
like,
what the heck is that?

1443
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:55,300
And it's just blood like it looks like a
horror movie.

1444
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:56,560
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1445
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:58,540
But there's a real.
Yeah,

1446
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,790
yeah.
Fuck it.

1447
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,830
Yeah.
It's on the video.

1448
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:02,550
You got to see that.

1449
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:05,530
They don't need to see that.
It sets a weird way to go though.

1450
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,810
Get squashed in an elevator.

1451
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:13,570
This is why I don't work on elevators.
People ask me all the time,

1452
01:06:13,821 --> 01:06:15,410
Tony,
we have a problem with the elevator.

1453
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:16,790
Can you get on top of it and fix it?

1454
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:19,120
Innovator before?
No.

1455
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:20,260
Yeah,
when I was a little kid.

1456
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:21,160
Yeah.
Oh Shit.

1457
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,180
Yeah.
It was like seven years old,

1458
01:06:22,181 --> 01:06:23,830
but have only 20 minutes,
you know,

1459
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,870
like probably blew a fuse or something
like that.

1460
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:29,950
But um,
I was in New York recently at one of the

1461
01:06:29,951 --> 01:06:32,950
theaters.
I think it was the beacon and they have

1462
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:35,590
this dude who runs the elevator back
there.

1463
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,350
Yeah,
I was with you.

1464
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:38,530
That's right.
You remember that the guy had like the

1465
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:42,370
handle and the exchanging.
It's like old school.

1466
01:06:42,371 --> 01:06:45,860
The old school elevator where you have
to have an operator is like you.

1467
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,490
There's no buttons to press.
This guy had to get you up and down.

1468
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,010
So it was.
Would it be saved from the 19 twenties

1469
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:52,250
or something like that?
Yeah,

1470
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,620
it might.
Yeah.

1471
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:56,790
What's that might have been before that
net total.

1472
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,610
Nineteen,
29.

1473
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,151
Oh,
that's it.

1474
01:06:58,151 --> 01:06:59,440
That's right.
I took a video of the dude.

1475
01:06:59,441 --> 01:07:01,510
That's right.
Wasn't that brother Jose?

1476
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:06,080
Jose.
This is a old elevator.

1477
01:07:06,081 --> 01:07:10,150
We're in here.
How long has this kind of elevator been

1478
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,510
here for 20 night.

1479
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:15,881
I said.
Yeah,

1480
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:19,930
it was the old ones on instagram.
You can only get 15 seconds or 30

1481
01:07:19,931 --> 01:07:22,000
seconds or something like that.
Yeah,

1482
01:07:22,001 --> 01:07:25,090
but that dude was operating that thing
like you had.

1483
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:30,330
It was a little lever to pull up and
pull down bad ass hold elevator,

1484
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:33,260
but I'm sure they fix it all the time.
Yeah.

1485
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,040
This thing up to that,
it's always.

1486
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,060
You can.
There's always that thing on the inside.

1487
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,500
That was in Italy.
I got an elevator from the 1800,

1488
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,850
the hotel at a 18.
Hundreds of elevator.

1489
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,330
Yeah.
It's super weird.

1490
01:07:46,331 --> 01:07:48,860
There's old ones.
You guys shut the door and shut the door

1491
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:50,590
and get to get inside.
It'll still work,

1492
01:07:50,591 --> 01:07:53,020
but yeah,
we'll just leave the door open.

1493
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,150
Yeah,
you could just door open and grab the

1494
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,700
floor as you're passing and rip your
fucking arms off.

1495
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:03,080
He could do that
if you looked at like how many people

1496
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:06,490
died from elevators versus how many
people have died from coconuts.

1497
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,100
You'd be shocked.
No one's scared of coconuts,

1498
01:08:09,101 --> 01:08:12,480
but coconuts.
Fuck up about 150 people here should

1499
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,870
know that.
Now,

1500
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,130
do you know when people die deer every
year?

1501
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:19,160
A lot.
200 in the United States.

1502
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,570
Wow.
200 deaths.

1503
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:26,020
They die from deer every year.
Every year you're driving down the road

1504
01:08:28,221 --> 01:08:32,930
listening to led Zeppelin,
and you hit this stupid fucking county

1505
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:37,070
forest horse and it goes flying through
your windshield and kicks your brains

1506
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:37,904
out.

1507
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,670
Two hundred people a year.
How many people do you think die on

1508
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:47,010
average in elevators per year?
I know pretty in the US.

1509
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,530
Six prince's.
One of them.

1510
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,910
Twenty six did die in an elevator.
Yeah,

1511
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,080
for real.
Yeah.

1512
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,750
Twenty 6 million elevators every year in
the United States.

1513
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,820
Jesus.
How many die from coconuts?

1514
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,060
I'm saying coconuts.
Over 100 a year.

1515
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,000
I think so worldwide.
I would say worldwide.

1516
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:08,060
More than 100 people a year die from
coconuts.

1517
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,690
Coconuts.
Coconuts falling on their head.

1518
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,820
Not Allergy.
Skin jacked.

1519
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,830
Fiftieth.
Yeah.

1520
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:17,210
Bitch.
That's worldwide,

1521
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,220
worldwide.
Good.

1522
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:21,050
Imagine if it was all in Jakarta,
in Jakarta,

1523
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:26,170
coconuts and people
walking home from school with your

1524
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:31,010
buddies to have them die.
I just a chest an embarrassing way to

1525
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:31,844
die,
right?

1526
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,600
Oh No.
That,

1527
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,020
that Husky sound.
Those things clobbering you on the head

1528
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,170
song.
The last thing you hear is your friends

1529
01:09:42,171 --> 01:09:44,630
laughing at you because that's probably
how they figured out.

1530
01:09:44,631 --> 01:09:47,270
The coconuts were edible.
It killed someone's friend.

1531
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,640
Someone freaked out and hit it with a
rock and went,

1532
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:50,300
oh,
we're good.

1533
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,730
This is some shit in here.
I killed my friend back then you are

1534
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,380
dead.
They didn't know that a coconut wasn't

1535
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:59,090
alive.
If something came out of the sky and

1536
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:02,000
killed your friend and you know you were
so stupid that you didn't even have

1537
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:04,280
clothes yet.
That's probably the first people that

1538
01:10:04,281 --> 01:10:08,120
figured out they could eat coconuts.
It'd be like the first balls,

1539
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:08,954
right?
Fruits.

1540
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:13,640
Mike probably sort of just hearing now.
They realized they could play soccer and

1541
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:15,170
stuff for sure.
Definitely.

1542
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,400
Wow.
Dude.

1543
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,610
I saw a demonstration of the day.
We've showed demonstrations that lie

1544
01:10:19,611 --> 01:10:22,820
next stuff before,
but this was the most ridiculous one lie

1545
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:27,360
next is this plastic stuff that they can
spray on things and they sprayed on like

1546
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:30,060
the undercarriages of some trucks and
like,

1547
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,910
like four wheelers that go out into the
country.

1548
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:34,830
You know those guys.
Those dudes do those four.

1549
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:37,920
We'll crawl fucking things and smashed
up against rocks.

1550
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,960
They'll lie next to their whole truck.
They'll.

1551
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,910
That'll be the paint for the outside of
it.

1552
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,590
Well,
they took a watermelon.

1553
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,060
They sprayed a watermelon with lynette
and dropped it off of like,

1554
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:53,070
I think it was like from 450 feet up.
This is the brick one.

1555
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,890
This is when we've already seen.
But this one's kind of fascinating to

1556
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:58,830
like check this out.
Like just show how they did it before.

1557
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,920
So they,
they drop this brick off the top of the

1558
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:06,921
building now and without the Linacs oh,
that's a,

1559
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,220
that's a,
that's when they shot the walls,

1560
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,340
the watermelon video.
But there's a bunch of shit before it.

1561
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:12,910
Oh,
is it the watermelon woman?

1562
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:13,650
Oh yeah.
It is.

1563
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,310
There.
It is.

1564
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,170
Trying to find it there.
It's right there,

1565
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,780
these guys.
So anyway,

1566
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,970
there's one of them where they're on a
tower.

1567
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:24,060
The tower one is a watermelon one dude.
I think it's a different one.

1568
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,280
Yeah,
it's not the same video.

1569
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:28,183
Is that it?
Yeah.

1570
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,270
Okay.
Take all of these are in there.

1571
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:32,730
This is a different one because this one
it's red,

1572
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,430
but it's the same goddamn thing.
So I guess they just couldn't hit it

1573
01:11:35,431 --> 01:11:38,280
with a hammer here.
They sprayed this shit on a watermelon,

1574
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:42,030
but the watermelon just.
He's like hitting it with a hammer.

1575
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,770
It's just bouncing,
but that's not as impressive.

1576
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,880
Cv,
you could find the one where they

1577
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:47,370
dropped the watermelon off the tower
lie.

1578
01:11:47,371 --> 01:11:48,380
Next.
Watermelon,

1579
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:51,630
450 feet drop.
I mean they threw this watermelon off

1580
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:55,600
the tower without the line x and it hits
the street and literally vaporizes just.

1581
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:57,850
They hit it.

1582
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,850
The throw the [inaudible].
It hits the ground.

1583
01:11:59,851 --> 01:12:04,320
It bounces 10 feet in the air that the
inside of it was just watermelon juice.

1584
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:07,110
It just became watermelon juice.
But this stuff is so tough.

1585
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:11,220
It's just some weird freaky plastic.
That'd be fun to like Prank Gallagher

1586
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:15,360
before he goes onstage.
Sprays water break is back,

1587
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:18,390
open its arms would literally fly off
his body.

1588
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:20,930
So you can you buy this consumer?
Yeah.

1589
01:12:20,931 --> 01:12:23,130
It's just.
I know my friend Remy,

1590
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:27,450
his dad actually owns a shop up in Reno
where they spray trucks with this stuff.

1591
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,680
Wow.
Yeah.

1592
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:33,480
Like people that want like a really
heavy duty application of their trucks

1593
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:36,660
are going to drive in the woods and
branches are going to smack up against

1594
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:38,850
it all the time.
They just spray their whole truck with

1595
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:40,050
this shit.
That's cool.

1596
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:42,330
Yeah.
There's a company called m

1597
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:49,230
d I think it's called Dev Rolo d e V e r
o l o.

1598
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:54,380
and they make these ridiculous souped up
Toyota Tundras that are bulletproof and

1599
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,260
they spray line x all over them.

1600
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:01,260
So like they,
they make them like regular and they

1601
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:03,140
make them bulletproof that like they
make them for like,

1602
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:06,510
you know,
some royal family or some shit that

1603
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:08,850
comes here from somewhere else and they
have this.

1604
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,700
What is this?
This is the video of the.

1605
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,270
Yeah,
lie next.

1606
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,590
Didn't make some other guys just put
this video out a couple like this past

1607
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:17,820
month.
Linacs didn't make the video,

1608
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:20,100
but they did use line x,
so let's watch it.

1609
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:23,370
Like here you go.
So he throws this watermelon

1610
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,240
off.
This ridiculous fucking power.

1611
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,100
Look at this.
It hits the ground.

1612
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,790
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1613
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,750
Wow.
Now can you cut into it like is it

1614
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:39,090
possible to get to that watermelon now
or is it like,

1615
01:13:39,091 --> 01:13:39,810
yeah,
you can cut it into,

1616
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,730
but look at this.
Look how hits the ground.

1617
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:46,020
It's like a ball.
I mean it seems like a medicine ball,

1618
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,250
like someone threw a medicine ball.

1619
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:48,960
What about bullet versus that?
What happened?

1620
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:53,070
No bullet would go through it.
It's just it has a unique ability to

1621
01:13:53,071 --> 01:13:56,670
disperse,
shock and rebound and not break open.

1622
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,950
It's really cool.
See if you find those trucks,

1623
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,390
Dev Rolo,
it's called.

1624
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:02,370
I think it's like some Russian company
or something like that.

1625
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:07,371
They make these souped up cars that are
covered in this shit about a lot of

1626
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:11,590
companies do that.
I guess cover business line shit to

1627
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:14,920
protect it from accidents then yes,
it would definitely protect you more

1628
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:16,960
from accidents and not having it for
sure.

1629
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:21,100
It would definitely make it harder for
an impact to get,

1630
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,190
you know,
like if your.

1631
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,200
If your car has a certain thickness of
steel on the door and you had double

1632
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:30,850
that thickness,
I would just assume there'll be safer.

1633
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,200
Right.
Doesn't that make sense?

1634
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:36,350
Well,
it makes you wonder like if it caves in

1635
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:39,440
then that also absorbs a lot of the
energy.

1636
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:42,890
But if you have bounced off it seems
like there'd be more snapping.

1637
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:44,703
Snapping.

1638
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,830
I'll take the snapping to the
penetrating.

1639
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,340
That's how you.
Your body gets crushed by a truck

1640
01:14:50,341 --> 01:14:52,290
hitting you on the side.
I don't know.

1641
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:53,780
Maybe a combination of the two.
Yeah,

1642
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:55,640
I don't.
I think maybe I'm

1643
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,250
just make sense that if it was a
thicker,

1644
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:01,530
stronger material,
like if you were driving around in a

1645
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:03,240
tissue paper car,
you'd feel real nervous.

1646
01:15:03,241 --> 01:15:05,400
Right.
It just seems to reason that if you

1647
01:15:05,401 --> 01:15:07,320
would get thicker and thicker gauge of
metal,

1648
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:11,520
so if you took like a regular gauge
metal that they have on like a Chevy

1649
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,360
Silverado or something like that and you
spray this line,

1650
01:15:13,361 --> 01:15:15,570
x shit over it,
this has got to make it stronger.

1651
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:20,340
There's just no way it doesn't.
If that's what it does with a watermelon

1652
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,870
off a 450 foot tower,

1653
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:26,320
what was you remember Saturn's where you
can scratch them.

1654
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:29,230
You could kick them and they never.
They were made out of plastic.

1655
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:33,730
Is that plastic?
Wouldn't that be like a safety hazard

1656
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:35,660
then if it was plastic?
No,

1657
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:36,790
no,
because as long as it's

1658
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:39,830
strong,
like plastics can be really fucking

1659
01:15:39,831 --> 01:15:41,990
strong.
Like there's certain types of plastics,

1660
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:47,350
like certain types of composite fibers
that elect technically plastics that are

1661
01:15:47,601 --> 01:15:51,290
ridiculously strong.
Like they use resins and they have these

1662
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,510
types of plastics that they can,
you know,

1663
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,260
they can make plastic where you can make
a plastic knife.

1664
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:01,250
We could kill somebody with it.
I mean plastic can be really hard.

1665
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,350
That's why it's such a good feature.
That car,

1666
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:07,160
I loved my Saturn and when I sold it it
was like 12 years old and it looked like

1667
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,580
the day I bought it or like brand new
because it didn't scratch her.

1668
01:16:10,581 --> 01:16:12,650
Did they make those anymore?
Now they went out of business,

1669
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:16,340
but that technology that you think they
would use it in other cars are and it's

1670
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:20,210
probably not gonna last.
I think cars want to break and go get

1671
01:16:20,211 --> 01:16:22,220
more parts.
Like gms are like,

1672
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,470
they like that thick at these trials.
This is a pocket

1673
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,670
immobile.
Wow.

1674
01:16:26,671 --> 01:16:28,460
That looks great.
Nothing insane.

1675
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:31,920
One Mile per gallon.
Yeah.

1676
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:36,050
Click on one of the pictures of them.
Things like the interceptor,

1677
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,770
the challenger,
the expedition.

1678
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:40,630
Yeah.
So all that stuff is linacs there.

1679
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,500
The entire outside of the truck,
the bumpers.

1680
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,560
Everything is covered in that line.
X Shit does it God damn tank.

1681
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,900
That thing.
You got a little Dick.

1682
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,790
That's your ride.
You're like,

1683
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:56,220
okay,
I want to distract you.

1684
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,710
Like bullet bullet tests on it or
anything,

1685
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,750
you know?
Will they do have bulletproof versions

1686
01:17:00,751 --> 01:17:02,760
of the car?
I don't know if that stuff is

1687
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,350
bulletproof.
I would doubt that it is,

1688
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:08,460
but I would say it's definitely better
than not having it on,

1689
01:17:08,461 --> 01:17:09,950
but look at that thing.
So manly.

1690
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,110
Ooh,
I got you to Ben and Kevin prayers.

1691
01:17:12,111 --> 01:17:13,790
Auto drive car the other day.
Oh,

1692
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:15,020
the Tesla.
It took you froze.

1693
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:16,130
Whoa.
Cool man.

1694
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:16,990
So weird.
And that.

1695
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,020
Yeah,
when he did it,

1696
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:22,910
it's hard to trust that like it's,
it's weird him just like letting go.

1697
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:25,820
And he said when he first bought it he
was really scared and nervous,

1698
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:26,830
but now he's like,
you know,

1699
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,270
laptop out like doing shit you shouldn't
be doing.

1700
01:17:29,271 --> 01:17:31,280
And,
and I watched it like detect the,

1701
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:33,800
you know,
the side car and stuff like that.

1702
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:36,080
And it stopped.
It slowed down

1703
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,440
because you know,
the guy that designed the self driving

1704
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:42,200
car was Asian and you're like,
you know,

1705
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:45,110
how do you know his age limit Asian,
Asian computer people.

1706
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,340
This is a bad attempt at some racist
humor and I'm not going to get.

1707
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:53,990
I can guarantee you the person that find
it engineered the self driving cars and

1708
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,430
Asian.

1709
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:55,450
If you're wrong,
you have to suck.

1710
01:17:55,451 --> 01:17:57,710
Brian Cochran,
show him.

1711
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,750
I'll take a couple of strokes in your
mouth.

1712
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,310
No,
I'll take the donkey cousin.

1713
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:08,311
Just real quick little but the uh,
the figure wrong that the IPAD or

1714
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:10,540
whatever,
the display and stuff.

1715
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:13,590
Crazy screen sexy,
but does it well,

1716
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,970
I would think that like,
that would use up a lot of juice.

1717
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,980
Like why would you have such a giant
screen?

1718
01:18:17,981 --> 01:18:20,140
It seems like if you have a true.
Yeah.

1719
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:21,040
But you know,
I didn't know.

1720
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,620
I didn't know about the fast charging
because we always talked about this in

1721
01:18:23,621 --> 01:18:26,260
the past about how like you can't drive
to vegas though,

1722
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:29,200
where they also have a stop in Vegas
that you plug it in for five minutes and

1723
01:18:29,201 --> 01:18:32,050
you get like two more hours.
Here's his effect though.

1724
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,760
What was the last time you drove to
Vegas?

1725
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:37,900
Uh,
drove up for the fight.

1726
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:39,370
That's the five months ago.
I always drive.

1727
01:18:39,371 --> 01:18:40,570
It's,
it's cheap.

1728
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:42,030
Well,
it's cheap,

1729
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,280
but don't you get annoyed being in the
car for four hours now.

1730
01:18:45,281 --> 01:18:49,340
I'm used to four hours of fun.
Me and pete smoke jolene wholly on like,

1731
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,760
let's say that you were driving back
though when you were in that Vegas

1732
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:53,530
traffic on the way back.
It was terrible.

1733
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:57,610
It's true.
You just owned you.

1734
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,540
Yeah,
but you're stuck though.

1735
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:03,640
It's two lanes for 400 miles to make it
to the stop.

1736
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:06,070
You'd be three hours away from it.
He's right.

1737
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,950
Fuck,
you know.

1738
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:12,520
I mean there's not just one.
There's not just one thing.

1739
01:19:12,521 --> 01:19:14,470
There's a lot,
but he's got a really good point.

1740
01:19:14,471 --> 01:19:17,170
If you're stuck in that crazy vegas
traffic coming home,

1741
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:21,130
you know how ridiculous I traffic is
traffic that makes you wake up at 4:00

1742
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,820
in the morning just to avoid it.
Yeah,

1743
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:25,690
I did it once.
I did it once and I barely made it

1744
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,420
because I left at 7:30.
I was like,

1745
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:31,040
I'll just get up before everybody else.
Oh No,

1746
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,130
no.
People are already up and driving at

1747
01:19:33,131 --> 01:19:33,964
7:30.

1748
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:37,910
It messed me up last week and coming
back from Mcgregor Diaz because they're

1749
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:39,740
like,
you gotta gotta gotTa beat the traffic.

1750
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:40,520
I'm like,
whatever.

1751
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,480
If we get there,
whatever.

1752
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,910
I ended up missing the summer slam
party.

1753
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,610
I Miss Summer Slam last week,
which was huge.

1754
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,990
Poor baby.
How long did it take you to drive home?

1755
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,650
It was like six,
seven hours,

1756
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:53,030
something like that.
See,

1757
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,460
that is fucking ridiculous.
Never been caught in that.

1758
01:19:56,461 --> 01:19:59,310
So ridiculous.
But if you had a gasoline,

1759
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,060
like a buddy of mine has a 50 gallon
tank in his truck.

1760
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:08,100
Fifty gallons so he could just drive it,
fills that bitch up

1761
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,530
and just.
I mean it gets shitty gas mileage.

1762
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:12,870
There's a catch 22 because you're
packing around all that weight,

1763
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,620
but if he's driving from vegas he
doesn't have to pull over.

1764
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,960
It's like the opposite of a tesla.

1765
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,440
Yeah.
I tried like my car's dead right now and

1766
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:26,610
I tried to jump start my car with my
girlfriend's car,

1767
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:29,220
which is a,
a Prius Prius and he can't do that.

1768
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:32,940
It was the second little 12 volt battery
inside those cars.

1769
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,520
Like it's not a regular it.
You can't do it.

1770
01:20:35,521 --> 01:20:38,430
It says in the book do not do.
You could just destroy this car.

1771
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,650
Oh,
that would be crazy if you blew that car

1772
01:20:40,651 --> 01:20:43,320
up.
I know those cars blow up,

1773
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:44,690
man.
How'd your car died?

1774
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,780
My car's got dead.
So many things wrong with her.

1775
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:48,460
Did you ever see

1776
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:49,490
that?
A member,

1777
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:54,510
when those fiscal Karmas blew up,
the fisker Karma was that dope looking

1778
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:00,240
space age electric car that actually had
a solar panel on the roof and that solar

1779
01:21:00,881 --> 01:21:04,390
panel on the roof charged up your radio
so your radio wasn't draining the

1780
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:08,400
battery as you were driving around and
they were cool looking cars like

1781
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:13,120
definitely the best looking out of all
the electric cars and they left a bunch

1782
01:21:13,121 --> 01:21:16,360
of them on a dock in Brooklyn,
I think it was,

1783
01:21:16,361 --> 01:21:18,640
or a no,
North Carolina or something like that.

1784
01:21:18,641 --> 01:21:21,400
Anywhere.
Somewhere by the water and the water

1785
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:25,480
came in the sea level.
Rose flooded the parking lot and all the

1786
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:27,910
cars went underwater and started
exploding.

1787
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:29,200
Wow.
Boom,

1788
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,410
boom,
boom,

1789
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:32,050
boom.
A.

1790
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,300
I don't know.
We tried to find it last time,

1791
01:21:34,301 --> 01:21:35,230
right?
We couldn't find it.

1792
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,550
Look,
look at them all.

1793
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:39,490
They all just blew up.
Wow.

1794
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,900
Pinto is.
Is that what it was in the eighties that

1795
01:21:41,901 --> 01:21:44,540
were blowing up?
Is that the right cars?

1796
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,360
Because it said Tesla under there.
Okay.

1797
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,860
Superstorm sandy.
Yeah.

1798
01:21:48,861 --> 01:21:51,290
16 fisker Karma,
you know,

1799
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,150
and everybody was like,
yeah,

1800
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,660
we're good.
And that company just went under.

1801
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:59,570
It's like the space x rockets that keep
blowing up on the thing.

1802
01:21:59,571 --> 01:22:00,051
They're like,
hey,

1803
01:22:00,051 --> 01:22:01,610
we're going.
It's pretty soon we'll fly you out to

1804
01:22:01,611 --> 01:22:03,740
Mars.
But meanwhile they can't even get out of

1805
01:22:03,741 --> 01:22:07,040
Florida.
I wouldn't fly on one of those fucking

1806
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:09,460
things for a hundred years for the.
Got It,

1807
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:10,640
right.
Yeah.

1808
01:22:10,641 --> 01:22:12,880
It's a noxious.
She'd pull up a real fisker

1809
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:14,700
Karma so you can see what one actually
looks like.

1810
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:18,300
It was a beautiful car.
Justin Bieber had one.

1811
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:19,470
It was totally chrome.

1812
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:20,361
Oh,
that's it?

1813
01:22:20,361 --> 01:22:21,680
Yeah.
That car chrome,

1814
01:22:21,681 --> 01:22:22,840
that bitch.
I couldn't.

1815
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:23,541
That one.
Oh,

1816
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:26,590
are they back?
So the back river road.

1817
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:27,890
Oh,
they have a new car.

1818
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,740
The revero.

1819
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,430
Ooh.
Why Karma?

1820
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:32,680
It's always been Karma.
Okay.

1821
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,790
I saw bieber driving that car once and
it is.

1822
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:39,490
That should be illegal because you ever
see that episode of chips where the.

1823
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:43,470
There was a truck driving a bunch of
mirrors in the sun,

1824
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:46,800
hit the mirrors and all these people
were like flying off the freeway.

1825
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:49,530
Same thing with that.
It was just like this giant glared

1826
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:50,670
coming down the stream.
You go back,

1827
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:52,460
do go back to the actual car.
I want to say it.

1828
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,460
Scroll down.
What you were looking at right here.

1829
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,180
What Brian was talking right there in
the middle?

1830
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,480
Yeah.
Picture of their car wrap.

1831
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,810
That's a wrap.
A wrap on it.

1832
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:03,820
Oh God.
It's so pretty.

1833
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,793
Is that a Karma

1834
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:08,740
data is so pretty.
Karma revero because if they just

1835
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:10,720
brought it back,
that is a beautiful car,

1836
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:12,060
man.
That is a goddamn be.

1837
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,450
That is without a doubt.
The best.

1838
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:18,250
Looking out of all those electric cars
like by far is is this gas tank option

1839
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:19,690
on it?
That's what I think so.

1840
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:21,460
I don't think so.
I think this is all electric.

1841
01:23:21,461 --> 01:23:22,960
God Damn.
That thing is sweet.

1842
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:25,390
That is sweet.
That's,

1843
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:27,550
that's the.
That's so much better looking than all

1844
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:31,030
the other ones because that looks like a
Maserati or something,

1845
01:23:31,031 --> 01:23:33,370
doesn't it?
I kind of like the BMW.

1846
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:35,800
That's like that though.
That looks like a Maserati fucked at

1847
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:38,200
Jaguar.
That's electrical at the beer that we go

1848
01:23:38,201 --> 01:23:43,201
on a vacation and come on Friday came in
a Jaguar and made that thing.

1849
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:47,320
What's the BMW electric sports car that
kind of looks like that?

1850
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,070
That's it.

1851
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:49,960
I don't like that one.
Well,

1852
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:51,550
it's.
It's kind of cool looking on the

1853
01:23:51,551 --> 01:23:53,770
outside,
but the issue is it has a really skinny

1854
01:23:53,771 --> 01:23:58,000
tires and it does piss poor performance.
It's not a fast car.

1855
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,750
It's a super expensive car and it's just
super space age car,

1856
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:04,720
but he looked at.
It's like zero to 60 in comparison to

1857
01:24:04,721 --> 01:24:08,380
like other cars at bmw makes like the m
four and look at.

1858
01:24:08,381 --> 01:24:10,620
It's like track time or trackability
sales.

1859
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:11,590
Skinny.
His tires are.

1860
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,350
See the back tires.
Those are really skinny,

1861
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,770
like that's not.
Well,

1862
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,170
no,
that's just what it comes with.

1863
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:22,470
This is not like a performance car.
It's a beautiful sleek piece of amazing

1864
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:26,590
automotive engineering.
It's design is incredible,

1865
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:30,310
but that's not what I like.
A car that looks like that and actually

1866
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:32,260
goes fast.
That's not.

1867
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,810
I mean it probably goes fast in
comparison to a lot of shit,

1868
01:24:34,811 --> 01:24:39,700
but if you compare the numbers I bet to
like between that and like a porsche

1869
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:41,890
nine slash 11 or something like that
would probably not even close.

1870
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:44,860
Kevin did.
It's a tesla like zero to 70 while I was

1871
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:48,100
in the car and I've been in like your
cars before in the past,

1872
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:52,390
but it was like three seconds and there
was no engine sounds so it kind of

1873
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:54,150
freaked you out.
It was like being on a roller coaster.

1874
01:24:54,151 --> 01:24:55,150
I.
It took my breath away.

1875
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:58,630
It was like those cars are ridiculously
fast.

1876
01:24:58,631 --> 01:25:00,370
It's crazy.
And they're four wheel drive too,

1877
01:25:00,371 --> 01:25:00,970
right?
Yep.

1878
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:04,360
It's four wheel drive and it has this
ridiculous engine where there's no

1879
01:25:04,361 --> 01:25:06,490
transmission.
Like in terms of like gears,

1880
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:11,850
it's like a direct drive,
so it just just goes like instant on the

1881
01:25:12,881 --> 01:25:15,430
solar roof will create enough energy to
power the car.

1882
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:19,030
No other vehicle sold in us has ever
offered this capability.

1883
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:24,270
Our owners consider our solar roof and
important element in our brand identity.

1884
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:27,820
And we listened today.
It's about to come out.

1885
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,260
Oh,
in two days it comes out.

1886
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,870
This whole episode has been a long
commercial.

1887
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:35,320
No,
that is dope though.

1888
01:25:35,321 --> 01:25:36,570
That the fucking car.
I mean,

1889
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,920
especially in La,
in La,

1890
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:42,310
that means you can drive that thing
around all the time because it's always

1891
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:44,920
sunny.
So if that thing actually can power the

1892
01:25:44,921 --> 01:25:46,660
car,
that's amazing.

1893
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:49,720
It does not seem right to soon as that
hits a rock,

1894
01:25:49,721 --> 01:25:51,070
it's going to explode.
How much is it?

1895
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,490
How much is this car?
I would assume we'll find out in two

1896
01:25:54,491 --> 01:25:55,960
days.
Um,

1897
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:00,190
I would bet it's over 100 grand.
I think those are super expensive cars.

1898
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:03,230
See if you could find out how much the
Karma was.

1899
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,190
Is that just the power

1900
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,100
of the car for like,
like the electronics and display but not

1901
01:26:07,101 --> 01:26:08,080
driving?
No.

1902
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:10,190
Saying the first one and be able to
power the car.

1903
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,290
Wow.
Yeah,

1904
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,860
that's insane.
That is insane.

1905
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:14,600
If they,
if they really did figure that out,

1906
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:17,960
it's over.
If you could figure out a way to make a

1907
01:26:17,961 --> 01:26:20,990
car run,
especially here where it's sunny every

1908
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:23,780
day just on solar power and you can
listen to radio.

1909
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:25,610
You don't have to.
There's no restrictions and if you're

1910
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:28,070
stuck in traffic,
it's not only is it not like draining

1911
01:26:28,071 --> 01:26:31,400
your battery is probably better because
it's just not using as much energy,

1912
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,150
but it's just being blasted by the sun
and recharging.

1913
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:37,020
Nighttime you're fucked.
Yeah,

1914
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,190
but it feel like you would store enough
like a tesla does.

1915
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:42,260
You know?
If it kept it at 100 percent,

1916
01:26:42,261 --> 01:26:44,510
I'd be just like a cell phone.
Be Amazing,

1917
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:44,760
man.

1918
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,900
If they could figure out how to do that,
that would be amazing.

1919
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:52,880
I mean that would,
at least around here in Arizona and

1920
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,920
places like Colorado,
places where it's sunny,

1921
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:57,170
they would put other cars out of
business.

1922
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:01,250
It doesn't seem possible though because
that sets a small solar panel I didn't

1923
01:27:01,251 --> 01:27:03,770
think.
Was that powerful enough to actually

1924
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:06,320
power a car?
Think solar panels are getting more

1925
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,570
efficient.
They must be.

1926
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:12,350
Well,
I know that Elon Musk has this new solar

1927
01:27:12,351 --> 01:27:15,550
bank thing that they're doing for your
house where it's.

1928
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,840
They'll put solar in your house and the
batteries themselves are so much smaller

1929
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,510
than they've ever been before.
They're cool looking and they like stick

1930
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:26,720
to your wall.
He'll like you have have the mounted on

1931
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:30,440
the wall and it's just,
it's not like a whole room like you used

1932
01:27:30,441 --> 01:27:34,040
to need like a whole room filled with
batteries to run a house on solar power,

1933
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,940
so not really that way anymore and as
these things are just going to get,

1934
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:41,870
if just the idea that you could power a
house on solar power today is crazy but

1935
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:42,560
true.

1936
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,430
So if you can power a house,
it's just a matter of time before that

1937
01:27:46,431 --> 01:27:49,100
stuff gets better and better and better
to the point where.

1938
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:52,910
I mean you could probably wind up doing
it in Seattle with what minimal sun

1939
01:27:52,911 --> 01:27:55,430
comes through.
The clouds that's going to happen.

1940
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,280
They're going to keep making these
things better just like they've done

1941
01:27:58,281 --> 01:28:01,340
with everything else,
whether it's televisions or cell phones

1942
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:04,400
or cars themselves.
Cars today,

1943
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:08,060
dude,
this is the golden era for automobiles.

1944
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,640
Like there's people look back and say,
oh,

1945
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:12,710
they didn't.
Nobody designs cars like they didn't

1946
01:28:12,711 --> 01:28:16,460
sixties to look at to look at your
right.

1947
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:18,590
Yeah,
those sixties cars were amazing to look

1948
01:28:18,591 --> 01:28:20,450
at,
but try steering one of those pieces of

1949
01:28:20,451 --> 01:28:22,730
shit.
Try hitting the brakes if fucking

1950
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:25,710
stroller rolls out in front of your car
though.

1951
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:29,060
Those things were terrible.
They were terrible handling.

1952
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:30,830
They're terrible on every corner.

1953
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:35,950
The car went bent sideways and then he
had to like hang on onto it while it

1954
01:28:36,051 --> 01:28:38,870
righted itself.
Like the whole car was made out of like

1955
01:28:38,871 --> 01:28:41,540
a flexible piece of aluminum tray,
like w,

1956
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:41,951
w,
w,

1957
01:28:41,951 --> 01:28:43,970
w,
but they were shit.

1958
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:47,600
Those cars were pieces of shit.
The design was terrible.

1959
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:51,260
Like they literally would.
The air would hit them when they would

1960
01:28:51,261 --> 01:28:52,910
drive.
They were not only were they not

1961
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,950
aerodynamic,
they will like scoops.

1962
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:59,360
There were like a sale.
It was like driving with a sale.

1963
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:03,990
Like the front actually caught the air
and it slowed the car down.

1964
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,010
I don't know much about old cars.
I didn't have a dad growing up.

1965
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:12,160
Yeah.
Portrait you being.

1966
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,960
Well I didn't learn from my dad either.
My Dad really doesn't give a shit about

1967
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,640
cars,
my stepdad.

1968
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:23,360
But if you ever seen like an old like
show a 1970 dodge charger.

1969
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:29,720
Here's a perfect example.
This shit is so an aerodynamic but

1970
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:33,390
undeniably dope.
One of my favorite movies,

1971
01:29:33,391 --> 01:29:35,940
death proof.
I'm pretty sure that's around the type

1972
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:37,650
of car.
It's a dodge challenger.

1973
01:29:37,810 --> 01:29:40,840
That's a challenger or charger.
I'm not a challenge,

1974
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:43,500
but if your car and death proof.
Have you seen that movie?

1975
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:44,390
I think that's.
That's.

1976
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,990
That's a 70.
That's interesting.

1977
01:29:45,991 --> 01:29:48,660
I thought that was a 69.
Maybe they did something different to

1978
01:29:48,661 --> 01:29:51,480
the bumper cars.
A 70 it let go right above it.

1979
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:52,920
Go right above it.
The one,

1980
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:53,720
the black one.
Sorry.

1981
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:54,570
That's.
That's one too,

1982
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:57,170
but that black one.
That's a 70 car.

1983
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:01,080
The bumper goes around the top all the
way around like a fish with its mouth

1984
01:30:01,081 --> 01:30:04,620
open.
I think that other one is a 69.

1985
01:30:04,621 --> 01:30:06,390
The far left one,
but that far left one.

1986
01:30:06,391 --> 01:30:08,190
It's fucking beautiful.
Look at that thing.

1987
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:11,280
God,
I think that's a 69 now.

1988
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:15,390
Unless maybe they changed the bumper.
Look how fucking sick that is.

1989
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,490
Have you seen death proof?
I don't know.

1990
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:19,020
Is that the Quentin Tarantino thing?
Yeah.

1991
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:20,880
No,
you would love it.

1992
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,890
Look what they just did.
They just reversed the picture.

1993
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,060
Right hand,
left hand drive.

1994
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,330
They just flip this picture around.
God,

1995
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:32,350
that thing so pretty.
So that that car was in that movie that

1996
01:30:32,731 --> 01:30:36,030
I'm not exactly sure of,
but that's the car right there.

1997
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:38,490
So
yeah,

1998
01:30:38,491 --> 01:30:43,170
that's a charger for sure.
There was one that they had in fast and

1999
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:48,171
furious that was all bare metal and it
costs more than a million dollars to

2000
01:30:48,691 --> 01:30:52,720
make
is ridiculous.

2001
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:56,770
It's silver now.
There's a silver one.

2002
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:01,710
Silver Dodge charger.
Just Google Silver Jewelry,

2003
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:05,420
silver dodge charger.
Fast and the furious.

2004
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:08,140
Do you miss sick fish your own?
Have you?

2005
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:09,200
Is it still alive?
No.

2006
01:31:09,201 --> 01:31:11,870
Fast.
And the furious Jamie A.

2007
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,360
Yeah.
That Reggie Bush character has it.

2008
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:18,250
Um,
that's it right there.

2009
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:20,020
Look at that thing.
Wow.

2010
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:23,380
There is no pain on that thing.
There's this clear coat over the bare

2011
01:31:23,381 --> 01:31:28,020
metal and it like,
it took forever to make the car.

2012
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:32,530
Took years to make it like literally a
rolling work of art.

2013
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:34,970
Hm.

2014
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:36,310
It's crazy looking car.
No,

2015
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,690
that's sick.
Fish was a piece of shit and it looked

2016
01:31:38,691 --> 01:31:39,560
great,
but it was,

2017
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:43,850
it was just not sorted outright,
is not built correctly.

2018
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:47,150
And that Reggie Bush guy had to do a
bunch of things to it after I did a

2019
01:31:47,151 --> 01:31:50,660
bunch of things to it.
I keep calling that Reggie Bush guy.

2020
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,520
You're hearing this Reggie.
I'm just high.

2021
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:54,580
Don't listen to me.
Do they?

2022
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:57,410
No disrespect.
Did they make electric motorcycles?

2023
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:59,740
Yes.
That is a dope car though.

2024
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,190
I miss.
I miss it.

2025
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,460
It wasn't a fun car to drive though.
Tell you that.

2026
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,010
Is that you?
Yeah,

2027
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:10,350
I'm just going to say it looks like that
was a I am,

2028
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:16,410
but I had that car made in like a,
a for a TV show in like 2005 or

2029
01:32:16,841 --> 01:32:19,150
something like that.
It was a.

2030
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:22,480
It was really pretty.
But the insides and the way it drove,

2031
01:32:22,481 --> 01:32:24,280
it was just,
it was designed to look really pretty.

2032
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,440
It wasn't designed to drive well the
sound of it.

2033
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:28,420
When you would pull into the comedy
store though,

2034
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:30,280
it was so awesome.
It was ridiculous.

2035
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:32,050
Giant engine five,
28.

2036
01:32:32,051 --> 01:32:36,130
Hemi just roared.
It was 600 and something horsepower.

2037
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:41,610
Such a stupid car.
Just sounds like Joey Diaz murdering it

2038
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,250
sounds like war.
It sounded like some death machine,

2039
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,590
you know,
he just wasn't safe.

2040
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,580
Like I had to get a bunch of things done
to it.

2041
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,080
The suspension detached from the frame
in my driveway.

2042
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,750
After I'd been on the highway going 70
miles an hour,

2043
01:32:55,751 --> 01:33:00,751
just 10 minutes before I pulled in,
pulled into my driveway and my car went

2044
01:33:00,851 --> 01:33:02,650
sideways and I was like,
what the fuck?

2045
01:33:02,651 --> 01:33:06,790
And I get out and the wheel is like half
hanging off and dug into the quarter.

2046
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,230
The fender.
I was like,

2047
01:33:08,231 --> 01:33:10,090
what the fuck?
I was just on the highway.

2048
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:14,080
Like if that broke loose on the highway,
I could've easily been dead.

2049
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:15,820
He's like,
when you're going 70 miles an hour,

2050
01:33:15,821 --> 01:33:17,590
you start flipping.
Good luck.

2051
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:19,670
Who knows what's going to happen is once
in a car,

2052
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:23,500
I'm going fast on the freeway,
like Tripoli and have all these guys

2053
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,350
were on a road trip and a tire popped.
That's crazy.

2054
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:27,170
Oh yeah,
man.

2055
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:29,520
Dangerous itself.
It's just dead.

2056
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,880
Yeah.
Very dangerous.

2057
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:32,500
Crazy.
I ran over a,

2058
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:34,750
you know,
those metal things.

2059
01:33:34,751 --> 01:33:35,610
Not,
not the,

2060
01:33:35,611 --> 01:33:36,820
uh,
the railroad.

2061
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:40,750
When you think of a railroad tie.
I'm not the wooden.

2062
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:42,460
Not Wooden piece,
right.

2063
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:46,810
That's what would that be a metal bar,
the metal stuff that would be a piece of

2064
01:33:46,811 --> 01:33:50,830
like a railroad track.
Somebody had left a piece of a railroad

2065
01:33:50,831 --> 01:33:55,120
track on the highway,
like a 12 inch section of it and I hit

2066
01:33:55,121 --> 01:33:58,690
that thing and it was like someone shot
my tire out with a rifle.

2067
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:03,400
He just my car when my car,
like literally caught air.

2068
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:06,850
It was a small car too.
I think it was my supra caught air,

2069
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:11,560
blew my fucking wheel apart,
like literally blew it apart and blew

2070
01:34:11,561 --> 01:34:13,960
the tire.
Half a part two and I was in the middle

2071
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:18,130
of the highway and it was a mile from
the exit and I was gonna pull over and I

2072
01:34:18,131 --> 01:34:21,070
was going to call aaa,
but kid I went to high school with,

2073
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:24,040
did that and died.
He got hit by a car.

2074
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,360
He was,
um,

2075
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:28,420
on the side of the road and he was
trying to change a tire and a guy just

2076
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,840
plowed right into him and killed him.
And I never forgot that.

2077
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:36,180
And I just drove gangster style on a
completely blown out.

2078
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:40,420
Randall.
It was banging and sparking and it

2079
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:42,540
smelled like fire.
It was like bang,

2080
01:34:42,541 --> 01:34:43,081
Bang,
Bang,

2081
01:34:43,081 --> 01:34:43,914
Bang,
Bang,

2082
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,451
Bang,
Bang,

2083
01:34:44,451 --> 01:34:45,284
Bang,
Bang.

2084
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:49,810
Just sparks and it's the rubber because
the rubber was like half hanging on,

2085
01:34:49,811 --> 01:34:50,650
half hanging off.

2086
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:55,300
It was just ripping and flying around.
When I was driving I drove all the way

2087
01:34:55,301 --> 01:34:57,620
to that fucking exit and all the way to
the side.

2088
01:34:57,621 --> 01:35:00,440
I just kept driving.
It was chewing up the sidewalk.

2089
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:04,110
It was probably fucking up the road,
like all the asphalt asphalts not that

2090
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:05,270
hard,
you know,

2091
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:06,970
fuck your rooms up there.
Do you remember?

2092
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:07,670
Said?
Yeah,

2093
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:08,990
there,
there was no rim left.

2094
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:12,620
It wasn't a rim anymore.
I mean it was just the whole outside of

2095
01:35:12,621 --> 01:35:15,950
it was just completely destroyed.
I fucked up a lot of suspension parts

2096
01:35:15,951 --> 01:35:18,020
too,
I think if I remember correctly,

2097
01:35:18,021 --> 01:35:19,940
but they towed it and fixed it,
but it was like,

2098
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:21,740
at least I'm alive bitch.
I'm like,

2099
01:35:21,741 --> 01:35:25,070
I would,
I would way rather or I would have left

2100
01:35:25,071 --> 01:35:29,360
it there and just ran down the side of
the road and made sure I was like way

2101
01:35:29,361 --> 01:35:32,330
off to the right.
I'm not staying in my fucking car on the

2102
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:34,880
road.
It's just too goddamn dangerous.

2103
01:35:34,881 --> 01:35:38,810
Especially today.
I see so many people fucking on their

2104
01:35:38,811 --> 01:35:42,860
phones driving on the highway at night.
We see their face lit up by the phone.

2105
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:44,450
It's so distracting.

2106
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:48,410
You see cops with their lights on
getting hit continuously.

2107
01:35:48,411 --> 01:35:52,280
So I mean a normal car.
It's got to happen all the time.

2108
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:53,690
Yeah,
yeah.

2109
01:35:53,691 --> 01:35:55,880
It's happening all the time.
But um,

2110
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:58,460
yeah.
So that was the most fucked up thing I

2111
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,440
ever drove over in my car.
But God damn,

2112
01:36:00,441 --> 01:36:01,930
that was loud.
Like black.

2113
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,720
I saw it too,
like last second I was like,

2114
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:06,580
fuck the fuck.
Like,

2115
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:08,420
you know,
you just realize there's not a goddamn

2116
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:11,390
thing you can do if you swerve and you
don't hit that.

2117
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:12,110
I was like,
well,

2118
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:15,050
if I swerve,
I'm probably gonna flip this car or

2119
01:36:15,051 --> 01:36:16,640
something fucked up.
It's going to happen.

2120
01:36:16,641 --> 01:36:17,930
I'm definitely going to lose control of
it.

2121
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:20,360
I might be able to just ride out this
impact.

2122
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:21,920
That's what I want.
I'm doing,

2123
01:36:21,921 --> 01:36:25,220
but
that's nothing.

2124
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:27,380
That's nothing.
You know,

2125
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:31,820
I watched this video once of this.
A car was on a snowy road and they were

2126
01:36:31,821 --> 01:36:35,570
driving in one direction and there's a
semi driver in the other direction and

2127
01:36:35,571 --> 01:36:39,080
the car in the snowy road starts
fishtailing and they lose control of the

2128
01:36:39,081 --> 01:36:44,000
car and they go right into the oncoming
lane and get hit by a semi and literally

2129
01:36:44,001 --> 01:36:47,870
disintegrate.
It is one of the best examples of how

2130
01:36:47,871 --> 01:36:51,080
fleeting life could be like you're
watching these people that drive in this

2131
01:36:51,081 --> 01:36:56,081
car and then it goes sideways and then
they're facing the truck and the truck

2132
01:36:57,681 --> 01:37:02,420
hit them head on.
Sixty miles an hour over.

2133
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:06,350
It just destroys the car.
The car just becomes like little pieces

2134
01:37:06,351 --> 01:37:09,680
of things that go all up in the air.
It's a.

2135
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,380
it's fucked up.
Look up man.

2136
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:18,030
This weekend I did the odd ball comedy
fest in a Detroit,

2137
01:37:18,281 --> 01:37:22,150
Chicago and Toronto and Brian Regan has
his own tour bus.

2138
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:28,140
That stuff is crazy because you don't
even feel like you're moving at all.

2139
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:30,880
You're just chilling,
hanging out,

2140
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:34,160
just hanging out in his apartment.
He has got the relocation,

2141
01:37:34,410 --> 01:37:36,460
real state of the art one,
like the newest,

2142
01:37:36,461 --> 01:37:37,420
newest,
newest,

2143
01:37:37,421 --> 01:37:40,570
and he helped design it.
All this stuff like he like got to like

2144
01:37:40,571 --> 01:37:42,940
play architect with it.
Like I want this there,

2145
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:46,720
I want to counter their chairs there,
make those captain chairs instead of

2146
01:37:46,721 --> 01:37:51,220
couches and it was just,
it was like being in the future because

2147
01:37:51,221 --> 01:37:56,160
you're moving in a house that doesn't
feel like it's moving.

2148
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,230
So does he stay in hotels or did you
just stay in his tour?

2149
01:37:58,231 --> 01:38:01,230
Bus Holidays in the tour bus has a
master bedroom,

2150
01:38:01,231 --> 01:38:03,750
has everything.
You don't ever need to do anything.

2151
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,300
Again,
weird relationship he has with that guy

2152
01:38:06,301 --> 01:38:09,720
who drives him around where he hit the
guy that drives them around is a second

2153
01:38:09,721 --> 01:38:13,140
generation tour bus driver.
He's been doing it 30 years.

2154
01:38:13,141 --> 01:38:18,141
His father was a tour bus driver for all
these big things and he basically bottom

2155
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,640
like.
It's like when he's on tour,

2156
01:38:20,641 --> 01:38:24,390
that's his guy and he's a super pro so
he knows what he's doing,

2157
01:38:24,391 --> 01:38:28,530
like a surgeon and he's cool.
Obviously he doesn't bother him or

2158
01:38:28,531 --> 01:38:29,580
whatever.
You know what I mean?

2159
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:33,360
What a weird life it is,
unbelievable,

2160
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:37,620
and it's the best thing ever because you
know how after a shell we have to go

2161
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:41,160
back to the hotel and then the next
morning you have to get up and go to the

2162
01:38:41,161 --> 01:38:45,090
airport and that takes an hour and then
you have to spend an hour there early.

2163
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:50,720
He leaves the venue and immediately
outside of whatever the closest back

2164
01:38:51,241 --> 01:38:55,380
door is is the door to his bus,
which is the house,

2165
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:56,360
so then you.

2166
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,720
You leave the venue in.
You're immediately at your own after

2167
01:38:58,721 --> 01:39:01,080
party.
You're immediately where you want to be.

2168
01:39:01,410 --> 01:39:05,520
Whoever you invite can come with you,
but you leave then and that driver

2169
01:39:05,521 --> 01:39:07,620
drives all night to wherever you want
them to.

2170
01:39:07,621 --> 01:39:12,240
When you wake up the next morning in
your bed at your destination,

2171
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:16,380
instead of waking up at a hotel and
having to go to the airport and then

2172
01:39:16,381 --> 01:39:19,500
having to get on the plane and then
having to get out of lax or wherever you

2173
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:22,500
are,
you just walk out that door that you

2174
01:39:22,501 --> 01:39:25,220
walked in from the venue.
You walk out the door again and you're

2175
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:29,610
at your house.
I realized that this is the actual,

2176
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:31,890
like new goals.
I got new goals.

2177
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:33,910
It's called bus goals,
goals,

2178
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,120
trying to sleep.
He slams on the brakes.

2179
01:39:36,121 --> 01:39:37,800
You wake up,
doesn't have car accident,

2180
01:39:37,801 --> 01:39:40,100
you catch on fire.
Didn't Ralphie have a boss?

2181
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:44,790
Ralphie is a bus.
Ralphie is a mansion.

2182
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:45,511
No.
Yeah,

2183
01:39:45,511 --> 01:39:49,110
Ralphie has a bus but this and it's
cool.

2184
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:51,270
But this bus,
I've been on some cool buses.

2185
01:39:51,271 --> 01:39:53,990
I'm friends with John Rich who's like a
huge country music star.

2186
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,190
Awesome bus.
But this bus,

2187
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:57,510
state of the art

2188
01:39:58,330 --> 01:40:00,700
says a bus.
He did the bus thing for awhile.

2189
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:05,900
I had a bus and you would bring the bus
to a movie sets to like as kids can hang

2190
01:40:05,901 --> 01:40:07,250
out on the bus.
Bus was dope.

2191
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:09,980
Fully set up and then he drove across
the country in the bus.

2192
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:14,000
And what he did was his family was on
the bus and he was behind them on a

2193
01:40:14,001 --> 01:40:19,001
motorcycle
so he could just ride his Harley on the

2194
01:40:19,221 --> 01:40:23,180
fucking highway right behind the bus
across the country.

2195
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,370
I mean,
she's just living fantasies.

2196
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:26,233
This point.

2197
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:30,640
Can I put a c do on top of my bus?
And uh,

2198
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,770
but yeah,
it's crazy you ever worked with Brian

2199
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:35,310
Regan?

2200
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:36,570
Well,
I've done some stuff with him.

2201
01:40:36,571 --> 01:40:39,270
He's done this podcast.
I know I've done some gigs with them

2202
01:40:39,271 --> 01:40:40,710
back in New York,
like back in the day.

2203
01:40:40,711 --> 01:40:42,270
He's a great guy.
He,

2204
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:42,510
it

2205
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:47,490
was so much fun and I've gotten to meet
all my heroes.

2206
01:40:47,491 --> 01:40:50,520
Ron White's been hanging out like an
animal at the store,

2207
01:40:50,521 --> 01:40:52,830
which is super surreal because it was
him and Brian Regan.

2208
01:40:52,831 --> 01:40:54,730
Where are comedy central guys growing
up,

2209
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,950
you know,
that's sort of like all you had that

2210
01:40:56,951 --> 01:40:59,130
wasn't on Hbo.
So like,

2211
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:02,050
you know,
it was a super surreal weekend because

2212
01:41:02,051 --> 01:41:04,470
he was,
he was very ron white,

2213
01:41:04,471 --> 01:41:07,780
so you know what I'm talking about.
Like he's down to hang with comedians.

2214
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:11,140
He's funny all the time.
It's not one of those guys that like

2215
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:16,141
shuts down and he was just a blast.
Like he is that guy.

2216
01:41:16,211 --> 01:41:18,670
So like if there's ever a dull moment
though,

2217
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:22,250
just he can pretty much say anything.
And it's funny because just sorta like

2218
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,500
that,
you know,

2219
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:26,170
and it's just boom,
it's just laying everybody out.

2220
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,780
It was a blast.
It was one of those great ones,

2221
01:41:28,781 --> 01:41:30,070
like they say,
don't meet your heroes,

2222
01:41:30,071 --> 01:41:31,720
but like he was a fun one.

2223
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,420
Yeah,
you can meet some of them.

2224
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,880
You can meet Ron White.
Yeah.

2225
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:38,880
Yeah.
It's um,

2226
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:41,970
you know,
it's a cool time at the store.

2227
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,670
Guys like Ron White hanging out.
Everybody's hanging out there now.

2228
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,830
It's crazy.
I told Brian Regan all about it.

2229
01:41:46,831 --> 01:41:47,531
I said,
you know,

2230
01:41:47,531 --> 01:41:50,160
you have to come because he really
enjoys La.

2231
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:53,610
I don't know.
I don't think he does.

2232
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,560
I don't think he really does it if he
does,

2233
01:41:55,561 --> 01:41:58,380
I'm sure it's like the will will turn or
something like that.

2234
01:41:58,610 --> 01:41:59,710
Well,
when I was talking to him,

2235
01:41:59,711 --> 01:42:04,180
he was saying he pretty much just kind
of writes and does the material at his

2236
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:05,330
shows,
you know,

2237
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:08,980
it just writes new shit and does it at
his shows in front of his audiences.

2238
01:42:08,981 --> 01:42:09,560
And

2239
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:12,020
I'll tell you this,
it was my second year doing these

2240
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:15,530
oddballs and I've never seen comedians
or myself.

2241
01:42:15,531 --> 01:42:18,770
I haven't laughed.
Like I was laughing at him since I was a

2242
01:42:18,771 --> 01:42:22,190
child since I,
since I very first started standup.

2243
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,890
You know how when you really start and
you're watching guys for the first time

2244
01:42:24,891 --> 01:42:26,090
and you're just dying,
she's like,

2245
01:42:26,091 --> 01:42:28,340
how are they doing that?
It was like that.

2246
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:32,960
His justice premises,
his delivery is everything.

2247
01:42:32,961 --> 01:42:36,140
Like it was surreal to watch every
single joke that he went into.

2248
01:42:36,141 --> 01:42:39,560
I thought to myself,
how have I never thought of that?

2249
01:42:39,561 --> 01:42:43,040
One of those things where over and over
and over again and you're like,

2250
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:44,570
Whoa,
he's about to talk about that.

2251
01:42:44,571 --> 01:42:48,310
I thought only I noticed that you're
watching an amphitheater

2252
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:53,980
continuously.
He's constantly touring to.

2253
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:55,550
Yeah,
I mean Brian's.

2254
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:57,600
He's everywhere,
but that's all he does now.

2255
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,540
It's interesting.
This is one of those guys like I feel

2256
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:02,120
like bill burr and Chappelle are always
in the thing.

2257
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:03,980
You know what I mean?
But he is.

2258
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,930
I mean,
I'm not saying he's bad or whatever,

2259
01:43:05,931 --> 01:43:06,820
but I mean like,
no,

2260
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:07,760
he's fantastic.
Yeah.

2261
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:11,480
You know the differences though,
he's clean and so people think of him as

2262
01:43:11,481 --> 01:43:14,300
being not as funny because he's clean
because you go,

2263
01:43:14,301 --> 01:43:15,650
oh,
well you can take your kids to go see

2264
01:43:15,651 --> 01:43:17,060
Brian Regan.
It doesn't matter.

2265
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:19,310
He's a killer.
Lays them out,

2266
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:21,380
you're like,
don't even notice that he's not clean,

2267
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,600
so everybody is clean because he's so
funny.

2268
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,050
It's totally irrelevant.
Yeah.

2269
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:26,220
Yeah.
It's just funny,

2270
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:27,810
but there was a lot.
You spend a lot of guys like that.

2271
01:43:27,811 --> 01:43:30,450
Like Mitch Hedberg is perfect example
that Mitch Hedberg,

2272
01:43:30,451 --> 01:43:31,830
people forget.
It was very clean.

2273
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:35,370
He hardly ever swore and if he did it
was totally unnecessary.

2274
01:43:35,371 --> 01:43:37,770
It was just having fun.
Like has jokes.

2275
01:43:37,771 --> 01:43:40,700
We're all like surreal Weirdo jokes,
you know?

2276
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:44,010
There's been a lot of people like that,
like Jerry Seinfeld,

2277
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:47,340
perfect example,
just not only was he clean,

2278
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:50,850
like he didn't even ever touch on
controversial subjects.

2279
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,190
I had to follow

2280
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:55,580
him at the comedy store a few weeks ago
talking about Mitzi shore and how she

2281
01:43:55,581 --> 01:43:59,480
has Parkinson's and she said he wasn't
funny three decades before.

2282
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:02,210
Whoa.
It was unbelievable.

2283
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:04,760
Out of everything I've done in standup
in nine years,

2284
01:44:04,761 --> 01:44:07,910
I've never been in a tougher position
than following Jerry Seinfeld.

2285
01:44:07,911 --> 01:44:12,911
I always like following good people,
but he just like went off on a rant

2286
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:17,981
about how this lady that owns this club
told me 38 years ago,

2287
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:19,490
whatever it was,
some crazy number.

2288
01:44:19,491 --> 01:44:21,680
I know it's more than 30,
the 30 for 36 days.

2289
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:24,800
She told me 37 years ago that I wasn't
funny.

2290
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:27,890
What's the deal with that brow?
You know what I mean?

2291
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:30,530
Like the room was just dying.
It was crazy.

2292
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:34,550
Speaking can many basically dropped the
mic and I did go up there just

2293
01:44:34,610 --> 01:44:35,443
horrendous.

2294
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,660
Speak it and die.
Tell me about Ann Coulter.

2295
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:41,810
Oh yeah.
That's what I'm dealing with all day.

2296
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:45,560
So the same culture situation.
Culture was at the roast of Rob Lowe.

2297
01:44:45,561 --> 01:44:47,690
It wasn't live right now.
It was on last night,

2298
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:49,700
but when did it,
when did they film it?

2299
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:51,560
Last Saturday.
Last Saturday.

2300
01:44:51,561 --> 01:44:53,170
So we'll only a week away.
Yeah.

2301
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:55,250
So what happened?

2302
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:57,060
Well,
you know,

2303
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:00,990
this is the sixth roasts that I've
written for the third one that I've been

2304
01:45:00,991 --> 01:45:05,991
a staff writer on and it's always
interesting when someone gets booked,

2305
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:07,560
you know,
what's gonna happen,

2306
01:45:07,561 --> 01:45:08,281
blah,
blah blah.

2307
01:45:08,281 --> 01:45:13,281
And Ann Coulter was one of the last
bookings that we had and I was excited

2308
01:45:13,321 --> 01:45:15,420
to help her and she,
uh,

2309
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:18,900
she didn't want,
she didn't want to do anything that the

2310
01:45:18,990 --> 01:45:20,900
writers told her,
you know,

2311
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:23,130
that she sort of had to do,
like to be funny.

2312
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:25,980
And she's like,
she didn't think anything was funny.

2313
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:29,880
So she rewrote everything,
like the script that we originally wrote

2314
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:32,280
anyway,
she bombed really bad.

2315
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:34,400
She bombed really bad.
But what was she trying to avoid?

2316
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:37,490
Like when you said she didn't want to do
what they wanted to do?

2317
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,610
Well we wanted her to write.
We had one,

2318
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:43,420
we had stuff in her voice,
like with her angle and a little bit of

2319
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:45,970
self deprecating at the top,
you know what I mean?

2320
01:45:45,971 --> 01:45:48,010
Like it was supposed to be like,
Hey,

2321
01:45:48,011 --> 01:45:49,840
I'm ann coulter,
you know,

2322
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,900
you might be wondering why I'm here at
the Rob Lowe Roast.

2323
01:45:52,901 --> 01:45:56,470
It's because it's the first time that
I'm not the most hated person in the

2324
01:45:56,471 --> 01:45:57,340
room,
you know,

2325
01:45:57,341 --> 01:46:01,360
like sort of like put it off on her
letter and you've got to acknowledge who

2326
01:46:01,361 --> 01:46:03,490
you are.
But instead she's like,

2327
01:46:03,491 --> 01:46:04,660
Nah,
I don't like them.

2328
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:06,360
I'm not gonna,
not gonna play.

2329
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,550
I'm not going to self middle.
I'm gonna Shit on myself.

2330
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:11,230
Suffer House.
Why would I do that?

2331
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:12,370
You know?
No,

2332
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:13,720
no awareness.
There's no.

2333
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:16,630
Those were her exact words,
but she just said she wasn't going to do

2334
01:46:16,631 --> 01:46:18,370
that and she would just cut out.
You Go,

2335
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,630
you go back and forth via emails and
then all of a sudden all the good stuff

2336
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:25,830
is cut out and there's bad stuff.
And some of the stuff's rewritten.

2337
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:27,360
Did you meet her in real life?
Yeah.

2338
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:30,720
Did you meet her in real life before the
actual roast or the day of?

2339
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:31,740
Uh,
the day of.

2340
01:46:31,741 --> 01:46:34,620
I talked to her on the phone five days
out,

2341
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:38,100
which she was okay on that and she's
like laughing at the script.

2342
01:46:38,101 --> 01:46:40,530
But then once it's in email she rewrote
it.

2343
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:43,280
It was bad.
But you really think that she's less

2344
01:46:43,281 --> 01:46:45,530
hated and Rob Lowe?
No,

2345
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:46,670
no,
not at all.

2346
01:46:46,670 --> 01:46:46,770
Oh,

2347
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:50,100
everyone loves rob lowe,
who

2348
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,260
was the most hated person in the room
besides her.

2349
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:55,360
Was The joke about Rob Lowe?
Yeah.

2350
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:57,030
The joke is like,
yeah,

2351
01:46:57,031 --> 01:47:00,790
now she's saying that she's hated.
She's acknowledged.

2352
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:01,630
Exactly,
but didn't.

2353
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:04,170
She's saying that rob lowe's hated,
so it's a joke,

2354
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:07,110
but it's not really written it.
That part doesn't need to be funny

2355
01:47:07,111 --> 01:47:09,540
though.
We just needed her to acknowledge that

2356
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,110
she's a piece of shit and she didn't
want to do that.

2357
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:16,790
Instead she came out and literally it's
like you might be wondering why on here

2358
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:20,190
what's it couldn't possibly be to
promote my new book,

2359
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:25,250
and she leans down all awkwardly and
pulls out her shitty book in trump.

2360
01:47:25,291 --> 01:47:27,510
We trust.
He pluribus awesome.

2361
01:47:27,511 --> 01:47:29,750
And she says,
wait a minute,

2362
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,593
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

2363
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:33,690
wait a minute.
Her new book is in trump.

2364
01:47:33,691 --> 01:47:34,850
We trust.
Yeah,

2365
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,150
at.
Wait for it.

2366
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,920
He pluribus.
Awesome.

2367
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:43,280
That's like the tag of the book.
She said it and just the roar boos from

2368
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:47,400
the crowd book.
She loves trump.

2369
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,990
That trump shit money she wrote.
That is her 11th book.

2370
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,100
She's written 11 books was worth a good
amount of money.

2371
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,640
Jesus.
What was the purpose of having her on

2372
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:02,790
the roast to begin with?
It seems like the roads have always had,

2373
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:03,840
like,
I kind of like a goat,

2374
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:05,430
you know,
like Jersey shore.

2375
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:08,090
They had the situation on one roast.

2376
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:11,340
We got to hold that back up.
I want to read this description.

2377
01:48:11,341 --> 01:48:12,174
Put,
pull up,

2378
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,830
make it smaller.
So here we go.

2379
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:17,850
Donald trump isn't a politician.
He's a one man wrecking ball against are

2380
01:48:17,851 --> 01:48:22,110
dysfunctional and corrupt establishment.
We're about to see the deluxe version of

2381
01:48:22,111 --> 01:48:24,510
the left's favorite theme.
Vote for us,

2382
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:28,190
or we'll call you stupid.
It's the working class against this

2383
01:48:28,191 --> 01:48:32,100
smirking class now,
and culture with her unique insight,

2384
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:37,160
candor and sense of humor,
who makes the definitive case for why we

2385
01:48:37,831 --> 01:48:41,520
should all join his revolution.
Wow.

2386
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:46,550
She just bent over.
She bent over for the man who might be

2387
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:48,500
king.
Yeah,

2388
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:49,573
she was.
She.

2389
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:51,320
She wants to play that character,
but yeah.

2390
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,670
Well,
if he wins and she wrote a book like

2391
01:48:53,671 --> 01:48:54,930
that,
she's in deep,

2392
01:48:54,931 --> 01:48:55,591
deep,
deep,

2393
01:48:55,591 --> 01:48:56,550
deep,
deep.

2394
01:48:56,730 --> 01:49:00,060
She will be the one to defend him every
time there's any sort of a public.

2395
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:02,590
No,
he doesn't like her by the way.

2396
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:05,330
He doesn't like her.
Doesn't like to see in one of the really

2397
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:09,280
funny things is that he changed his
immigration policy,

2398
01:49:09,281 --> 01:49:14,281
like tweak the tone of it the day before
that book came out and it's sorta like

2399
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:17,290
mess things up because.
Yeah,

2400
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:19,290
because he's sorta like a,
you know,

2401
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,190
office books like all about like,
yeah,

2402
01:49:21,191 --> 01:49:24,070
don't let anybody in his zero
immigration.

2403
01:49:24,071 --> 01:49:25,930
And he was sorta just like,
you know,

2404
01:49:25,931 --> 01:49:30,280
he visited Mexico like out of nowhere,
like the day before her book came out

2405
01:49:30,281 --> 01:49:31,170
and she's like,
uh,

2406
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:33,220
you know,
it just wasn't good press for her.

2407
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:34,700
What does he say?

2408
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:38,160
Or seeing the Mexicans or have to leave
and they're going to have to go through

2409
01:49:38,161 --> 01:49:41,550
the proper channels in order to legally
immigrate to the United States.

2410
01:49:41,551 --> 01:49:43,530
You're going to have to go back to
Mexico first.

2411
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:45,510
The,
he knows.

2412
01:49:45,511 --> 01:49:47,770
No one's doing that.
No one's going back to Mexico.

2413
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:48,693
Dude,
stop.

2414
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:50,410
Definitely.
Did you know that?

2415
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:52,210
Um,
who was it that,

2416
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:53,140
uh,
tweeted this,

2417
01:49:53,141 --> 01:49:57,760
Pete Dominick tweeted this,
that there is like a literally zero

2418
01:49:57,761 --> 01:50:02,761
percent gross migration from Mexico.
Like the amount of people that come over

2419
01:50:04,781 --> 01:50:08,950
here from Mexico versus the amount of
people that leave here and go to Mexico,

2420
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:13,660
it evens out.
There's like a zero percent migration.

2421
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:15,880
That sounds like a steady written by a
Mexican.

2422
01:50:18,150 --> 01:50:19,930
Well,
I was wondering whether or not it takes

2423
01:50:19,931 --> 01:50:22,330
into account illegal immigration and if
it does,

2424
01:50:22,331 --> 01:50:23,950
how could they possibly know what the
numbers are?

2425
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:27,340
It seems like they don't.
Otherwise you're watching the people

2426
01:50:27,341 --> 01:50:29,050
come in,
you're counting them and then you know

2427
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:30,750
where they are and then you're just
done.

2428
01:50:30,770 --> 01:50:33,610
You're like a part of the problem.
You're like letting them come over the

2429
01:50:33,611 --> 01:50:34,900
border.
Like how many people come over the

2430
01:50:34,901 --> 01:50:36,670
border every day and get away with it a
lot?

2431
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:40,420
Oh yeah.
I know like five people that came over

2432
01:50:40,421 --> 01:50:43,870
here from Mexico.
They just come over.

2433
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:45,880
Come over.
Yeah,

2434
01:50:45,881 --> 01:50:48,820
I mean I think I would too.
For sure.

2435
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:52,440
I just think
there's.

2436
01:50:52,441 --> 01:50:54,430
There's two ways to handle this.
This is what I think.

2437
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:59,640
I think if you want to like go into the
magical mystery world of of impossible

2438
01:51:00,281 --> 01:51:04,810
ideas,
the best impossible ideas help Mexico so

2439
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:08,350
much that they don't want to come over
here because it's awesome over there to

2440
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:10,930
like help them figure out how to make
Mexico awesome,

2441
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:15,460
but they're not going to do that because
the best way to get people to work for a

2442
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:20,461
bucket day and some fucking underarmour
factory or Nike factory or whatever they

2443
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:22,990
do down in Japan,
which is totally legal.

2444
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:24,940
You know,
if they want to do that down in Mexico

2445
01:51:24,941 --> 01:51:26,360
or Volkswagen.
Yeah.

2446
01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:29,260
I mean a bunch of companies make shit
down in Mexico and the reason why they

2447
01:51:29,261 --> 01:51:32,280
do it is they bring jobs to impoverished
communities.

2448
01:51:32,281 --> 01:51:35,590
These people get a chance to make money
more than they ever would have made on

2449
01:51:35,591 --> 01:51:39,400
their own without these plants,
but they're working for significantly

2450
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:41,560
less than they would if they were living
in the United States.

2451
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:45,310
So it gets.
It gets real weird.

2452
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:47,100
It's like,
you know,

2453
01:51:47,101 --> 01:51:48,820
yeah.
Is it better for them than it used to

2454
01:51:48,821 --> 01:51:50,260
be?
Absolutely.

2455
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:52,900
But is it as good for them as it is here
and fuck?

2456
01:51:52,901 --> 01:51:56,230
No.
Well is it okay for a company to keep

2457
01:51:56,231 --> 01:51:59,500
people in a position where they're never
going to be in as good a position as

2458
01:51:59,501 --> 01:52:02,290
they would if they were working in the
United States with our laws?

2459
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:03,573
Is it okay?

2460
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:04,960
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

2461
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:06,370
It's trip.
If you buy an iphone,

2462
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,350
you Kinda,
you kinda of a part of the problem.

2463
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:12,330
If you bind sneakers,
most likely you're not making sleek

2464
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:15,190
sneakers in Columbus.
Hyphens in Mexico City,

2465
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:16,480
they make them.
No,

2466
01:52:16,590 --> 01:52:18,580
I met some of them.
Did they make some of them in Mexico?

2467
01:52:18,581 --> 01:52:20,200
Mexico.
Some of them in China.

2468
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:21,850
What if they jump off Mexico?
No,

2469
01:52:21,851 --> 01:52:23,320
because you're fucking hard work and
people,

2470
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,280
they're not going to dive off the
building like a pussy.

2471
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:29,050
They're going to finish their job and
they're going to have some Tequila and

2472
01:52:29,051 --> 01:52:30,280
party.
Yeah,

2473
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:33,340
they do that.
Mexicans have fun.

2474
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:35,990
They're the wrong people to hate
Mexicans,

2475
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,230
to have awesome food.
They're festive.

2476
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:40,750
They're very family oriented there.
I mean,

2477
01:52:40,751 --> 01:52:42,100
yeah,
there's drug violence,

2478
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:46,580
but that's just human beings.
Like the Mexican culture is pretty

2479
01:52:46,581 --> 01:52:47,880
fucking chill,
you know,

2480
01:52:47,890 --> 01:52:49,670
like as far as like having neighbors.
Like,

2481
01:52:49,671 --> 01:52:51,530
dude,
you could have your next door.

2482
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:55,820
Neighbors could be like some crazy North
Koreans that want to kill you.

2483
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:57,440
Like if you live in,
in South Korea,

2484
01:52:57,590 --> 01:53:00,110
you got real immigration problems,
you've got a real problem with your

2485
01:53:00,111 --> 01:53:02,360
border because you're got North Korea
and South Korea.

2486
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:04,850
You're fucking next door neighbors run
by a,

2487
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:09,320
a murderous dictator that's worse.
That's way worse.

2488
01:53:10,190 --> 01:53:11,510
What do we got?
We've got beaches,

2489
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:14,030
tacos.
Dan's people cool as fuck.

2490
01:53:14,031 --> 01:53:15,500
They like bull fighting.
That's a little weird.

2491
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:17,690
Two.
That's the past.

2492
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:21,650
That's the shit.
I watched an amazing documentary on

2493
01:53:21,651 --> 01:53:25,280
Netflix about bullfighting watering.
I sorta want to go see it,

2494
01:53:25,281 --> 01:53:28,690
but I want to go to Spain to see it.
I think that the big ones are in Spain.

2495
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:31,230
You're gonna have to do it soon.
I have a feeling they're gonna slowly

2496
01:53:31,231 --> 01:53:32,550
make that shit illegal.
People.

2497
01:53:32,551 --> 01:53:33,570
There's so much pressure.

2498
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:36,900
Wait till you see the.
Any stadiums filled.

2499
01:53:36,901 --> 01:53:37,620
I mean it's like.

2500
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,453
No,
I understand,

2501
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:42,240
but there's also a lot of protestors.
Even these European countries or it's

2502
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:44,280
been a tradition,
you know,

2503
01:53:44,490 --> 01:53:47,340
it's fucked up way for these animals to
die,

2504
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,230
you know,
it is very weird.

2505
01:53:49,590 --> 01:53:52,160
I mean occasionally the matador gets it
and that's,

2506
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:54,000
that's something that you don't see in
America.

2507
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:57,660
There's not a single thing that we do
where you have that much of a

2508
01:53:57,661 --> 01:54:02,010
possibility of getting mercked by a huge
animal with horns on his head.

2509
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:04,680
This is not.
I mean bull riding I guess Sorta,

2510
01:54:04,681 --> 01:54:07,290
but I guess those guys do get stomped.
Yeah,

2511
01:54:07,291 --> 01:54:08,980
they do,
but they're not trying to kill the bull.

2512
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:10,290
Right.
It's a totally different kind of an

2513
01:54:10,291 --> 01:54:13,470
exchange.
The bull rider is a guy who's just

2514
01:54:13,471 --> 01:54:16,020
trying to hang on for eight seconds.
The matador.

2515
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:19,680
I mean that shit will take a while and
they're going to stab the fuck a thing.

2516
01:54:19,681 --> 01:54:21,420
People are going to hand them different
swords.

2517
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:25,170
He's going to try to stab it in the back
of the neck and you got a bunch of

2518
01:54:25,171 --> 01:54:27,840
people that are helping them to and
they're poisoning that thing and

2519
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:29,550
throwing poison darts into it,

2520
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:33,860
in the,
in it to get like bigger to get more

2521
01:54:33,861 --> 01:54:37,070
famous as a matador.
Like you take more chances,

2522
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:40,070
you know there's this thing,
one move where like you just get down on

2523
01:54:40,071 --> 01:54:44,570
your knees and spread your legs before
they let the bowl out and your whole

2524
01:54:44,571 --> 01:54:47,360
thing is like that first move because it
comes up with the.

2525
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:51,080
You see it coming around the corner when
they release it and you have your back

2526
01:54:51,081 --> 01:54:53,480
to the bull,
you are starting like,

2527
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:54,710
yeah,
like down,

2528
01:54:54,711 --> 01:54:58,510
not not back to the bowl,
down on your knees and someone's going

2529
01:54:58,511 --> 01:55:01,420
to do it that way.
That'd be your back to bowling.

2530
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:05,930
I think that's a little blade.
Wesley snipes.

2531
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:08,690
Jump up and slice it.
Snake off as it comes towards you.

2532
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:11,090
Celebrity.
Matador would be a great show.

2533
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,770
Wesley snipes versus a bowl.

2534
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:16,520
Did you see the most recent bull attack
matador thing where it went up?

2535
01:55:16,521 --> 01:55:19,970
His asshole.
The horn literally went up,

2536
01:55:19,971 --> 01:55:24,290
his asshole tore his insides apart in
this thing has just ragdoll on him with

2537
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:27,890
a horn in his asshole.
I think he died.

2538
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,150
Yeah,
he died,

2539
01:55:29,151 --> 01:55:29,984
right?
Yeah.

2540
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:31,960
Whoops.
Yeah.

2541
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:37,030
I mean that shit can happen,
but I mean I think they eat the bowl,

2542
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:39,780
but it's just a fucked up way to do it
was like,

2543
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:41,190
I guess.
I guess it's a,

2544
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:44,010
it's a tradition.
You kind of think this is

2545
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:48,030
like a barbaric tradition from days gone
by when people didn't know any better.

2546
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:51,710
It's a very slow death to.
Did they eat all those dead reindeers?

2547
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:53,640
I got electrocuted by lightening
question.

2548
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,650
I was thinking about that.
This reindeer good meat.

2549
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:57,370
Yeah,
it's Caribou rain,

2550
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,270
deer and Caribou.
Basically the same thing.

2551
01:55:59,271 --> 01:56:02,460
It's just different names for it and
Caribou is one of the most delicious of

2552
01:56:02,461 --> 01:56:04,200
all game animals.
Apparently.

2553
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:09,510
They're also one of the rare deer where
the females have antlers too,

2554
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:12,540
like the male and the female have
antlers.

2555
01:56:13,110 --> 01:56:15,600
They all have antlers is to fight off
wolves apparently.

2556
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,800
So the males have antlers to like head
butt each other and I'm like,

2557
01:56:19,801 --> 01:56:23,170
what bitch?
But the females I'm antlers to like

2558
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:25,980
protect their children.
Maybe that's just a theory.

2559
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,660
Maybe they're all androgynous.
Yeah.

2560
01:56:28,780 --> 01:56:31,380
Or they just live it up in the Tundra.
That's just makes hard bitches.

2561
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,360
A lot of the women have in Alaska looked
like they could be.

2562
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:38,820
It's Pat.
Even the female theorists are giant

2563
01:56:38,821 --> 01:56:42,210
lesbians.
It's a hard life up there for Caribou.

2564
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,820
Plus they're all on this migration.
So,

2565
01:56:44,821 --> 01:56:46,800
uh,
when you see Caribou's marching across

2566
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:48,810
the field,
you'll see like maybe even hundreds of

2567
01:56:48,811 --> 01:56:49,980
them,
but they're all online.

2568
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:51,720
Like your father.
There's a line of them.

2569
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,910
So you see them coming from like a mile
away.

2570
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:56,100
So you just get in position,
find out where they're going to be.

2571
01:56:56,430 --> 01:57:00,210
Go down past where there are right now.
They seem to be going in this direction.

2572
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:01,410
Sit Down,
wait,

2573
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:03,370
set the gun up.
And what,

2574
01:57:03,371 --> 01:57:04,470
what?
Let them walk close.

2575
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:06,420
That's the people.
Do they let him walk?

2576
01:57:06,421 --> 01:57:09,630
Close and bubbling.
Blam blam were eating ham.

2577
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:14,460
Delicious Ham.
So good though.

2578
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:18,060
Caribou's delicious.
So 300 of them died because they were

2579
01:57:18,061 --> 01:57:23,010
all in a rainstorm and they were all on
wet grass and the electricity hit the

2580
01:57:23,011 --> 01:57:24,690
lightening bolt hit and they all got
cooked.

2581
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:26,640
Oh,
that would have been crazy video.

2582
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,250
It says five still walking around.
When this showed up,

2583
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:31,960
they had to put them down.
Why?

2584
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:35,020
Because they saw too much crazy shit.
PTSD,

2585
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:39,300
Vietnam vets.
Fuck man.

2586
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:43,260
It just look what they did to my.
They were all sad.

2587
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:47,820
Caribou.
Who lightening is fucking crazy.

2588
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,690
You really stop and think about the fact
that there are these things that float

2589
01:57:51,691 --> 01:57:56,691
in the sky and out of them come
impossibly powerful beams of electricity

2590
01:57:57,211 --> 01:58:00,480
that split trees down the middle and
Cook people.

2591
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:05,760
My friend remy who was talking about
earlier where his dad owns that a lie,

2592
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:09,910
next place he got hit by lightning when
he was in high school and he.

2593
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:13,920
He talked about it on the podcast and he
said it was just like you didn't even

2594
01:58:13,921 --> 01:58:17,010
realize what happened until after it
happened way after it happened.

2595
01:58:17,011 --> 01:58:20,100
It was just trying to come to try to
figure out why the fuck he was on the

2596
01:58:20,101 --> 01:58:24,510
ground and like what happened?
I could just shut your whole system.

2597
01:58:24,511 --> 01:58:25,344
Just gets

2598
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,790
Barbara from Youngstown,
Ohio.

2599
01:58:28,850 --> 01:58:33,560
We had this old legendary guy called
green guy and he got struck by

2600
01:58:33,561 --> 01:58:36,260
lightening as a kid and literally was
green forever.

2601
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:37,790
What?
Some green dude.

2602
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:40,630
The real guy.

2603
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:42,370
Yeah.
Guy That was just green.

2604
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:44,710
Maybe it was purple.
It's been a long time.

2605
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:47,290
But purple guy or green guy.
Here it is.

2606
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,000
Go Green Guy.
Green man.

2607
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:52,000
That's him.
Where's that photo of western

2608
01:58:52,001 --> 01:58:53,890
Pennsylvania,
but that's next to me.

2609
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:56,790
I mean eastern a job.
What's that photo?

2610
01:58:56,830 --> 01:58:57,850
Beaver falls.
Yeah.

2611
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:01,410
He looks like snoopy or something.

2612
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:03,620
Is that he lost his face.
Is that what it is?

2613
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:06,380
This is a black and white picture,
so you can't really tell that he's green

2614
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:11,150
version of the story so you can read it
or he lost his eyes.

2615
01:59:11,151 --> 01:59:12,290
Nose and one arm.

2616
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:14,330
Oh yeah,
he got electrocuted.

2617
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:16,370
That's what it is.
There was a,

2618
01:59:16,371 --> 01:59:19,530
um,
a store that I seen on some me,

2619
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:23,390
I believe it was a youtube video the
other day of this guy was hiking and he

2620
01:59:23,391 --> 01:59:26,870
saw a bear that was dead,
his giant bear,

2621
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:32,200
and he went up to it and poked it with
his knife and immediately exploded in

2622
01:59:33,381 --> 01:59:35,330
electricity.
He lost his arm,

2623
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:38,240
lost his vision last,
I think it lost his hearing.

2624
01:59:38,241 --> 01:59:42,290
My wife lost one of his legs,
just got hit with an impossible bolt of

2625
01:59:42,291 --> 01:59:46,730
electricity because the bear had dug
into a power wire and bitten into the

2626
01:59:46,731 --> 01:59:49,640
power wire and he just,
by touching it with his knife,

2627
01:59:49,641 --> 01:59:53,720
he just tapped right into that power and
blew his arm completely off of his body.

2628
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:55,110
Yeah.

2629
01:59:55,110 --> 01:59:59,430
I've seen a few of those videos.
And what's crazy about electricity also

2630
01:59:59,431 --> 02:00:02,490
that a lot of people don't factor in is
that it sticks you right where you are.

2631
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,690
I once got electrocuted really badly at
my grandma's house when I was a kid.

2632
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:07,500
Uh,
she,

2633
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:10,710
you know,
she had like these old old type of light

2634
02:00:10,711 --> 02:00:15,711
bulbs that were like old fluorescents
and you know,

2635
02:00:17,701 --> 02:00:20,910
little metal handle on the sink.
And I remember I grabbed the handle and

2636
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:23,730
blind and you can't get your hand on the
handle.

2637
02:00:23,731 --> 02:00:26,130
That's the thing with electricity is
you're stuck.

2638
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:29,640
So you're like,
this sucks and you can't pull away.

2639
02:00:29,641 --> 02:00:32,220
You're trying,
but it sticks you there.

2640
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:36,540
So I imagine like a lot of people just
had creepy fucking deaths from

2641
02:00:36,541 --> 02:00:39,060
electricity.
Can't get away from it.

2642
02:00:39,061 --> 02:00:40,030
It keeps you there.
Yeah.

2643
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:42,480
Electric fence.
When I was a kid I was trying to climb

2644
02:00:42,481 --> 02:00:45,960
up this fence to hang out with some cows
or horses or something.

2645
02:00:45,961 --> 02:00:47,730
And I grabbed onto it and was electric
and I was like,

2646
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:49,320
I couldn't let go.
I remember just,

2647
02:00:49,390 --> 02:00:54,030
and it's like five seconds,
but it feels like for ever electricity.

2648
02:00:54,110 --> 02:00:57,110
So bizarre.
The fact that we have electrical signals

2649
02:00:57,111 --> 02:00:59,840
in our own body and that electricity is
in.

2650
02:00:59,841 --> 02:01:02,990
Everyone's like this room,
I think about how much you take

2651
02:01:02,991 --> 02:01:05,930
electricity for granted,
but how much it's shaped modern life.

2652
02:01:06,230 --> 02:01:08,930
It's very rare.
You're not around electricity,

2653
02:01:09,230 --> 02:01:12,470
but electricity itself is only like a
couple of hundred years old.

2654
02:01:12,690 --> 02:01:14,840
Like as an invention,
like people harnessing it.

2655
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:17,900
Like what the Ben Franklin when,
when was that experiment?

2656
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:22,960
If you had to guess when there's been
Franklin had that kite where the key key

2657
02:01:23,601 --> 02:01:24,434
hanging from it?

2658
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:27,410
17.
If you had to guess 60,

2659
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:29,090
17,
16,

2660
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:31,480
I would say.
Wow.

2661
02:01:31,481 --> 02:01:35,380
That's a crazy one to think of.
Eighteen 76.

2662
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:37,990
Well he was like 1776 guy.
Right.

2663
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,630
So he was a part the uh,
he was one of the founding fathers.

2664
02:01:41,631 --> 02:01:44,960
So 1750 2:17,
52.

2665
02:01:44,961 --> 02:01:47,180
This motherfuckers out there with a
kite.

2666
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:50,450
First of all,
how ball or must America been back then?

2667
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:52,100
Just.
No,

2668
02:01:52,130 --> 02:01:55,280
no lights.
Benjamin Franklin was a beast

2669
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:57,460
man.
He did like a lot of stuff.

2670
02:01:57,490 --> 02:01:59,200
Smoked a lot of weed.
Is that true?

2671
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:00,310
Yep.
I just made it up.

2672
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:03,990
That's from like dazed and confused or
something.

2673
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,680
How high.
They're huge.

2674
02:02:05,681 --> 02:02:07,930
Pothead.
Each other.

2675
02:02:07,931 --> 02:02:08,860
Jamie,
what'd you say?

2676
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:12,460
That wasn't how high that was.
His Bong at the end of the method man

2677
02:02:12,461 --> 02:02:16,980
movie
probably was a pothead because

2678
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:19,620
I think he grew.
It didn't make sense for sure.

2679
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:20,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

2680
02:02:20,931 --> 02:02:23,830
If you look Google Ben Franklin weed,
I'm pretty sure he.

2681
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:28,010
Not only did he grow it,
I think he talked about smoking it dazed

2682
02:02:28,011 --> 02:02:29,930
and confused.
There was that whole scene about how he

2683
02:02:29,931 --> 02:02:32,920
grew weed and had been frankly,
man,

2684
02:02:32,921 --> 02:02:36,610
he agree with.
They all were getting high back then.

2685
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:38,060
Of course,
they knew about it.

2686
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:39,890
If they knew about it,
they were using.

2687
02:02:39,891 --> 02:02:42,170
It just didn't have the stigma does
today.

2688
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:44,930
America's founding fathers loved hamp.
Yeah.

2689
02:02:44,931 --> 02:02:47,480
Didn't he write something?
George Washington wrote something about

2690
02:02:47,481 --> 02:02:48,314
it as well.

2691
02:02:48,370 --> 02:02:50,770
I sort of saw it said that he had a hemp
paper mill.

2692
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:52,753
Franklin did.

2693
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:54,060
Well,
this is back when they,

2694
02:02:54,061 --> 02:02:57,060
you know,
the whole thing that fucked hemp up was

2695
02:02:57,570 --> 02:03:01,380
the cotton gin.
When Eli Whitney came up with a cotton

2696
02:03:01,381 --> 02:03:03,660
gin,
it made it easier for them to process

2697
02:03:03,661 --> 02:03:07,050
cotton because before they had to use
slaves and it was a.

2698
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:09,930
It was a real pain in the ass and the
same thing with hemp,

2699
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:13,470
like what would they had to use with
hemp was they used to have to beat it

2700
02:03:13,471 --> 02:03:17,280
down to get to the fiber.
He used to have to smash it and like it

2701
02:03:17,281 --> 02:03:21,510
was a like a long laborious process,
but that's what they use for everything

2702
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:24,750
they did.
The reason why canvas is called canvas

2703
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:29,960
is from the word cannabis.
Hemp is what the actual paper that's

2704
02:03:30,121 --> 02:03:33,810
used to make canvas.
Like when you make a painting you see

2705
02:03:33,811 --> 02:03:38,100
like the Leonardo Da Vinci paintings or
Mona Lisa or something like that.

2706
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:42,330
That stuff is all on hemp.
Like they made them on him.

2707
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:45,300
Like one of the first drafts of the
declaration of independence.

2708
02:03:45,301 --> 02:03:48,540
They wrote it on hemp.
Hemp paper was real common,

2709
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:53,900
but then they came up with a more
economically efficient way to process

2710
02:03:54,290 --> 02:03:56,220
continent.
Hemp fell off.

2711
02:03:56,520 --> 02:04:01,520
Then when slavery became abolished,
hemp really fell off because it wasn't

2712
02:04:02,341 --> 02:04:06,510
economically feasible until the 19
thirties than the 19 thirties.

2713
02:04:06,511 --> 02:04:09,720
They invented this thing called the
decorticator and the decorticator

2714
02:04:09,721 --> 02:04:13,190
allowed them to like really effectively
and almost instantly processed the hemp

2715
02:04:13,191 --> 02:04:13,920
fires.
This group,

2716
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:17,100
big crazy machine crank and as soon as
that came out,

2717
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:21,000
that's when William Randolph hearst
started running all those ads about

2718
02:04:21,001 --> 02:04:24,720
black people and Mexicans smoking
marijuana and raping white women.

2719
02:04:24,721 --> 02:04:27,420
It was all just to try to stop the hemp
industry.

2720
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:31,230
They turned it into a marijuana thing
and we're still suffering to this day.

2721
02:04:31,870 --> 02:04:32,703
Amazing.

2722
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:34,310
You can grow hemp now,
right?

2723
02:04:34,311 --> 02:04:37,440
In the United States.
Some spots on it getting yet.

2724
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:37,980
Well,

2725
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,060
we're.
We're being real careful with being real

2726
02:04:42,061 --> 02:04:45,000
careful with this marijuana thing
because well,

2727
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:48,240
one day we're for sure going to get
involved in either Colorado or

2728
02:04:48,241 --> 02:04:51,480
Washington state for sure.
Why wouldn't we sell like super healthy?

2729
02:04:51,481 --> 02:04:54,200
We'd will find it,
but it's not.

2730
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:57,780
This is just to touch and go right now
with legalization,

2731
02:04:57,781 --> 02:04:59,910
it's too sketchy.
Federal government is still telling

2732
02:04:59,911 --> 02:05:03,960
people that they can't get guns.
This is the most recent ruling that you

2733
02:05:03,961 --> 02:05:06,030
can't have a gun if you have a medical
marijuana card,

2734
02:05:06,150 --> 02:05:09,930
which is fucking insane because you
could drink booze all day long.

2735
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:13,050
Excuse me.
You could take pharmaceutical pills,

2736
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:18,090
opiates all day long if you want it to.
You can do a bunch of different mind

2737
02:05:18,091 --> 02:05:20,250
altering things and still legally
possess a gun,

2738
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:23,880
but you can't smoke pot if there's any
drug that you should have while you're

2739
02:05:23,881 --> 02:05:25,680
high.
It's when you have a gun,

2740
02:05:25,681 --> 02:05:26,514
rather it's pot.

2741
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:30,470
If there's any drug,
it's pot because that's the drug that's

2742
02:05:30,471 --> 02:05:32,010
gonna make you go.
Now I shoot anybody,

2743
02:05:32,011 --> 02:05:32,780
man.
Right.

2744
02:05:32,780 --> 02:05:34,380
You know,
like all the other ones are gonna

2745
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:38,640
displace your reality.
All the other ones are going to put you

2746
02:05:38,641 --> 02:05:41,490
in a position where you're,
you're probably gonna feel less

2747
02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:44,940
inhibition and you're,
you're probably more likely to shoot

2748
02:05:44,941 --> 02:05:46,950
someone if you're drunk,
you're probably more likely to shoot

2749
02:05:46,951 --> 02:05:47,480
someone.
Sure.

2750
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:50,250
On pills.
Crazy fucks.

2751
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:52,590
Yeah.
That whole pot things messed up.

2752
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:54,180
So,
uh,

2753
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:55,620
back to Ann Coulter.
Yeah.

2754
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:58,170
So this silly bitch.
So what does she try to do?

2755
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:00,690
She tries to write our own jokes.
Then.

2756
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:02,250
Yeah.
You know this,

2757
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:05,190
you know,
like I worked with Martha Stewart for

2758
02:06:05,191 --> 02:06:06,900
the Bieber Roast.
She crushed it,

2759
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,740
crushed it.
The first thing she said to me is,

2760
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:13,100
I want to kill as hard as I can.
So Hook it up and I'm like,

2761
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:15,470
Stuart's done time.
That's what I want you to do.

2762
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:16,710
Yeah.
She's the best ever.

2763
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:20,360
She's been in the pokey.
She stands shit at a level and culture

2764
02:06:20,361 --> 02:06:23,660
where they're privileged lifestyle of
white people everywhere she goes.

2765
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:28,750
Correct.
And so ann coulter basically says that,

2766
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:30,160
you know,
she doesn't like this joke.

2767
02:06:30,161 --> 02:06:32,020
She doesn't like that joke.
She writes this,

2768
02:06:32,021 --> 02:06:35,440
she puts a pitch for a book at the top.
First off,

2769
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:38,320
she was like a third to last.
She was second.

2770
02:06:38,380 --> 02:06:40,240
So Rob Lowe,
it went Ann Coulter,

2771
02:06:40,241 --> 02:06:41,380
Jeff Ross,
Rob Lowe,

2772
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,550
and to show,
right.

2773
02:06:42,551 --> 02:06:45,040
So all these people went before Ralph
Masaccio,

2774
02:06:45,370 --> 02:06:47,230
Nikki Glaser,
Pete Davidson,

2775
02:06:47,330 --> 02:06:49,640
Jimmy Carr,
a blah blah blah,

2776
02:06:49,641 --> 02:06:51,250
blah blah.
Anyway,

2777
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:55,270
and she got lit up and I mean big time,
Peyton Manning,

2778
02:06:55,271 --> 02:06:56,740
jewel,
everybody.

2779
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,750
They'd hit everybody on the day as you
know,

2780
02:06:58,810 --> 02:07:01,410
because you always make fun of everybody
at a roast of course,

2781
02:07:01,450 --> 02:07:03,670
and then you get the main target at the
end of your thing.

2782
02:07:04,030 --> 02:07:07,480
But when people went in on Ian Coulter,
they went in hard,

2783
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:11,590
very hard.
Like Jimmy Carr had this one joke which

2784
02:07:11,591 --> 02:07:13,850
I loved,
which I'm going to completely

2785
02:07:15,430 --> 02:07:18,670
destroy right now because I.
I don't know exactly how he set up,

2786
02:07:18,671 --> 02:07:23,671
but it was something like Ann Coulter is
here and you ugly ratchet faced piece of

2787
02:07:24,221 --> 02:07:25,510
shit scum bucket.

2788
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:29,290
It's like something like that.
Just like five insulting words just gag

2789
02:07:29,291 --> 02:07:31,630
that I can't get a gang.
And he goes,

2790
02:07:31,631 --> 02:07:34,720
you are one of the most insufferable
human beings on the planet,

2791
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:37,450
but it's not too late.
You can change.

2792
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:41,440
You could kill yourself.
And the crowd just home.

2793
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:45,550
I mean just everybody hated her,
so she was great to have on the Deus.

2794
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:49,390
Wow.
She could have killed me and Mike

2795
02:07:49,390 --> 02:07:51,880
Lawrence,
who's a huge pro wrestling fan and Sarah

2796
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:54,100
Tiana,
who's an old school pro wrestling fan.

2797
02:07:54,130 --> 02:07:55,870
We looked at her like,
wow,

2798
02:07:55,871 --> 02:07:58,870
we can write her as a heel.
She'll own it.

2799
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:02,200
It'll be great.
We're all going to look like superstars

2800
02:08:02,201 --> 02:08:04,330
because we were able to make ann coulter
funny,

2801
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:08,020
but instead halfway through the week we
realize like,

2802
02:08:08,050 --> 02:08:10,450
oh no,
she doesn't get it and she wants to do

2803
02:08:10,451 --> 02:08:14,170
this and you don't want to scare away
from not being on the roast.

2804
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:15,340
You know what I mean?
You don't want to be like,

2805
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:16,174
hey,
you're going to,

2806
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:20,440
you're going to do terrible because then
they know there's a chance that you

2807
02:08:20,441 --> 02:08:22,900
might not do it.
And we wanted her there because you

2808
02:08:22,901 --> 02:08:24,520
know,
you're gonna show she's going to do

2809
02:08:24,521 --> 02:08:25,210
good,
great.

2810
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:26,890
Everybody's gonna Shit on her.
But also,

2811
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:28,690
you know,
worse comes to worse.

2812
02:08:28,691 --> 02:08:31,810
People love a train wreck.
And this was a train wreck.

2813
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:32,950
Super trainer.
There was

2814
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:37,120
no,
this was like a gift of a train wreck.

2815
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:39,080
It just going to watch it.
Boom,

2816
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:40,570
boom.
She was terrible.

2817
02:08:40,571 --> 02:08:44,920
And the one thing comedy central did do,
which is hilarious,

2818
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:49,540
is the reaction shots that they chose
for her jokes,

2819
02:08:49,541 --> 02:08:51,900
like when she was on stage,
uh,

2820
02:08:52,570 --> 02:08:54,910
are hilarious.
Like it just cuts to just.

2821
02:08:54,911 --> 02:08:57,760
People just started just studying.

2822
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:00,870
Well,
she made her bones in the safest,

2823
02:09:00,871 --> 02:09:04,110
softest world,
which is the world of like political

2824
02:09:04,111 --> 02:09:07,140
commentary where there's five different
people and everybody's shouting over

2825
02:09:07,141 --> 02:09:09,990
everybody and you don't have to say
anything that's really relevant and

2826
02:09:09,991 --> 02:09:11,910
especially her because she's just a
button pusher.

2827
02:09:12,330 --> 02:09:14,520
She's a white lady,
button pusher and she gets up there and

2828
02:09:14,521 --> 02:09:17,490
she says crazy things like if Canada
doesn't like it will invade them.

2829
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,370
She says stupid shit like that.
She doesn't even mean,

2830
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:21,990
you know,
and like this is what she does.

2831
02:09:21,991 --> 02:09:25,760
She pushes buttons and Bill Maher calls
her his friend and they laugh together.

2832
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:28,920
Ha.
And she lives in the soft world.

2833
02:09:29,310 --> 02:09:33,990
That world that she stepped into is not
just one of the hardest worlds,

2834
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:39,350
but for a person like her to go on after
someone like Jimmy Carr and get washed

2835
02:09:40,170 --> 02:09:43,680
and then attempt to plug her book and
all that Jazz,

2836
02:09:44,070 --> 02:09:48,780
like I bet she has no idea what the
average person's perception of her is

2837
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:52,970
because she's dealing with that bubble,
that fucking talk show and shit.

2838
02:09:53,390 --> 02:09:54,460
Crazy idiots.
Yeah.

2839
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:58,420
That weird bubble where she's kind of
legitimate in that bubble and you know,

2840
02:09:58,490 --> 02:09:59,760
she's the button pusher.
Oh,

2841
02:09:59,761 --> 02:10:02,250
here it was crazy.
And you know,

2842
02:10:02,370 --> 02:10:03,510
she thinks she's wacky

2843
02:10:03,930 --> 02:10:05,130
and another thing is,
you know,

2844
02:10:05,131 --> 02:10:08,790
one of the main things that are roast is
when you get made fun of you should

2845
02:10:08,791 --> 02:10:10,000
laugh.
Yeah.

2846
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:12,570
Because it shows that you have a sense
of humor.

2847
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:14,790
That's like the main thing.
That's why trump did it.

2848
02:10:14,791 --> 02:10:17,120
Now he's could be president.
Charlie Sheen did it.

2849
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:19,740
Pro Trump can be president because he
did a roast.

2850
02:10:19,770 --> 02:10:23,910
Hey
Justin Bieber's the number one artist in

2851
02:10:23,911 --> 02:10:25,460
the world.
Oh,

2852
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:28,430
it's all gross.
If you can handle the road trying to

2853
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:30,010
talk you.
I'm trying to get you to want to do a

2854
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:32,160
Joe Rogan rose.
That's what we want out of here.

2855
02:10:32,220 --> 02:10:32,990
Joe Rogan.

2856
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,220
So when Ann Coulter does

2857
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:35,930
this,
I'm changing the subject immediately

2858
02:10:35,931 --> 02:10:36,840
looking at that.
I'm not doing.

2859
02:10:37,310 --> 02:10:39,830
I'm not being mean to you and I don't
want you being mean to me,

2860
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:43,940
but when you do this roast with Ann
Coulter,

2861
02:10:43,941 --> 02:10:45,740
what happens when people are joking
about her?

2862
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:47,230
Oh yeah.
Well,

2863
02:10:47,231 --> 02:10:51,820
that's the best thing is she did not
laugh at anything about her and she

2864
02:10:51,821 --> 02:10:55,000
always just had the same look on her
face and it stuck.

2865
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:58,780
That's it.
Every single joke like you just put in

2866
02:10:58,781 --> 02:11:00,490
just basically,
hey,

2867
02:11:00,550 --> 02:11:03,250
we want you to die.
That's the look that it would cut back

2868
02:11:03,251 --> 02:11:05,050
too.
And the crowd when you're watching it on

2869
02:11:05,051 --> 02:11:08,950
tv,
that's funny because she's not laughing

2870
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,030
and he called her hatchet,
faced a ratchet hatchets or oh,

2871
02:11:13,050 --> 02:11:16,780
horse face got Peyton manning said,
I'm not the only champion up here.

2872
02:11:16,781 --> 02:11:19,300
Ian Coulter won the Kentucky Derby a
couple of weeks ago.

2873
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:23,560
Peyton manning annihilated.
Now that's a guy who,

2874
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:26,140
you know,
and Sarah Tiana was really hands on with

2875
02:11:26,141 --> 02:11:29,380
him and you know,
he got his script,

2876
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:31,840
made tweaks,
studied it all week.

2877
02:11:31,870 --> 02:11:34,630
He put it in prompter himself.
He's with the prompter guy,

2878
02:11:34,631 --> 02:11:35,620
you know,
before the show,

2879
02:11:35,621 --> 02:11:39,550
making sure that every word is perfect.
Exactly where he wants it.

2880
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:43,450
And he stole the show.
Him and Joel were the two best jewel.

2881
02:11:43,451 --> 02:11:44,800
The singer.
Yes.

2882
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:46,810
No Shit.
She was so great.

2883
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:49,240
Really.
One of the things she said right at the

2884
02:11:49,241 --> 02:11:50,200
top of her set,
you know,

2885
02:11:50,201 --> 02:11:51,790
she's like,
you know,

2886
02:11:51,791 --> 02:11:55,450
as a feminist,
I can't agree with everything that I've

2887
02:11:55,451 --> 02:11:59,110
heard up here tonight,
but as a person who hates Ann Coulter,

2888
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:04,810
she annihilated.
She's so good.

2889
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:06,650
That's awesome.
Yeah.

2890
02:12:06,670 --> 02:12:11,470
I wrote for her
that was a sort of the room a hands on.

2891
02:12:11,471 --> 02:12:14,080
Ella was a guy named George Ryan Black,
good roast writer.

2892
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:16,420
Uh,
some other people,

2893
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:20,650
they're smart Tiana's in on that too.
Such a smart move to pair them up with

2894
02:12:20,651 --> 02:12:22,690
comics,
coach them through it.

2895
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:23,081
Oh,
well,

2896
02:12:23,081 --> 02:12:24,820
I mean then they wouldn't have a chance
on their own.

2897
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:26,680
I know,
but I mean as far as entertainment

2898
02:12:26,681 --> 02:12:28,990
value,
like you could have been a gross

2899
02:12:29,270 --> 02:12:32,560
clusterfuck of you got to see their own
real ideas.

2900
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:34,360
But yeah,
it's definitely better.

2901
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,233
And you know,
there were,

2902
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:38,560
there were reading an awesome prompter.
It's show business.

2903
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:40,660
So you would say that Martha Stewart is
like the best ever.

2904
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:42,420
I mean,
you know,

2905
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:43,840
I'm a little bit biased,
but yeah,

2906
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:46,290
she's the best ever roaster.
She's just

2907
02:12:46,650 --> 02:12:49,380
freakishly great human being at
everything she does.

2908
02:12:49,470 --> 02:12:52,010
She's the best.
She's a baller dude.

2909
02:12:52,050 --> 02:12:55,080
Not only did she have more prison time
than all those other people in the day

2910
02:12:55,081 --> 02:12:58,560
is like snoop and shy.
She's just a Keller.

2911
02:12:58,590 --> 02:13:00,540
She killed.
She's a billionaire,

2912
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:04,090
she's a assassin.
They put her in jail for some weird shit

2913
02:13:04,091 --> 02:13:04,750
to.
Right.

2914
02:13:04,750 --> 02:13:07,930
Was it like knowledge of a stock sale or
something like that?

2915
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:10,120
Insider trading.
How does that work?

2916
02:13:10,121 --> 02:13:12,700
So if you say,
if you have a stock,

2917
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:13,601
okay,
in,

2918
02:13:13,601 --> 02:13:14,440
you know,
you're,

2919
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:16,240
you're working in some company like,
hey dude,

2920
02:13:16,241 --> 02:13:18,100
I'm just letting you know right now,
uh,

2921
02:13:18,101 --> 02:13:19,510
we're about to sell,
sell,

2922
02:13:19,511 --> 02:13:21,100
sell.
So if you want to get out,

2923
02:13:21,130 --> 02:13:22,240
get out now.
And I'm like,

2924
02:13:22,241 --> 02:13:23,410
Oh shit,
thanks dude.

2925
02:13:23,411 --> 02:13:25,180
I'm getting out.
And then I do that.

2926
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:29,980
I'm supposed to just sit by and not do
that and lose money.

2927
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:31,930
Like how does that work?
Can you tell me the,

2928
02:13:31,931 --> 02:13:32,070
some

2929
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:36,210
shit's going down and I should bail out
immediately and I don't bail out.

2930
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:38,970
I lose all my money.
Then I got to stay out of jail.

2931
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:41,310
Is that how it works?
I'm pretty sure.

2932
02:13:41,311 --> 02:13:43,650
Like you just can't be super blatant
about it.

2933
02:13:43,651 --> 02:13:46,200
Like the SEC or whatever it is,
a,

2934
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:50,190
I can't remember what it is,
but a securities and exchange council.

2935
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:54,030
Yeah.
So they commissioned like if they see

2936
02:13:54,031 --> 02:13:58,680
that you just sold millions of dollars
worth of stocks that day or two before

2937
02:13:58,681 --> 02:14:00,930
something absurd happens with that
company,

2938
02:14:00,931 --> 02:14:03,330
then you know,
it's sort of blatant.

2939
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:04,220
Did you ever see it?

2940
02:14:04,220 --> 02:14:06,880
Stuff that's connected to nine slash 11.
There's another nine slash 11 thing.

2941
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,430
So how many people sold American
Airlines stock?

2942
02:14:10,510 --> 02:14:14,080
How many people predicted that American
Airlines stock would crash and it's all

2943
02:14:14,081 --> 02:14:17,860
like Illuminati type bloom bloom.
Not Bloomberg.

2944
02:14:17,890 --> 02:14:20,750
What are those people?
Bilderberg Bilderberg characters.

2945
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:23,690
Yeah.
Selling American airline stock.

2946
02:14:23,691 --> 02:14:25,490
It's probably bullshit.
Did you ever snopes that

2947
02:14:28,130 --> 02:14:30,610
says false,
but wait a minute.

2948
02:14:30,730 --> 02:14:35,680
I saw this documentary on Youtube,
put pay.

2949
02:14:35,681 --> 02:14:38,560
What does it say on September 11th,
blah,

2950
02:14:38,561 --> 02:14:38,831
blah,
blah,

2951
02:14:38,831 --> 02:14:39,251
blah,
blah.

2952
02:14:39,251 --> 02:14:44,251
The operation and taking years to plan.
Was it saying Jamie false status false.

2953
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:48,280
Only to delay the takeoff,
blah,

2954
02:14:48,281 --> 02:14:48,611
blah,
blah,

2955
02:14:48,611 --> 02:14:49,300
blah,
blah.

2956
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:50,740
It was a long ass paragraph.

2957
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:55,630
I'm sorry this wasn't spirit airlines
that went into shit.

2958
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:58,120
I wish it was.
Spirits are really airline.

2959
02:14:58,180 --> 02:15:01,210
They're the worst.
What spirit airline?

2960
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:04,310
It's like all the planes that get
graffitied and stuff.

2961
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:06,580
It just didn't turn in the spirit.
Airline.

2962
02:15:07,120 --> 02:15:08,590
Goodwill,
goodwill airline.

2963
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,930
Yeah.
It's like they get like pushed started

2964
02:15:10,931 --> 02:15:12,070
and shit.
They're terrible.

2965
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:16,660
You have to pay just to print out your
your itinerary ticket and you have to

2966
02:15:16,661 --> 02:15:18,760
pay per bag.
Like any bag.

2967
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:21,490
Your purse is a bag fee.
They would charge you for your fanny

2968
02:15:21,491 --> 02:15:22,370
pack dude.
Yeah.

2969
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:24,220
They'd be like,
what are you doing?

2970
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,470
Well,
there was a time where the lady told me

2971
02:15:26,471 --> 02:15:28,360
that I had to take it off and put under
the seat.

2972
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:32,660
Your Fanny Fanny to count.
Oh,

2973
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:35,950
weren't you the one that told me that
you couldn't use bluetooth headphones on

2974
02:15:35,951 --> 02:15:37,480
a plane.
I use them all the time.

2975
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:40,480
I've never been told anything.
You're not supposed to.

2976
02:15:40,690 --> 02:15:43,300
According to the lady that talked to the
guy who was sitting next to me,

2977
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:45,700
she said he couldn't do it.
You can't do it,

2978
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,570
sir.
Are Those Bluetooth?

2979
02:15:47,571 --> 02:15:50,260
You're going to have to take them off.
Different Lady.

2980
02:15:50,290 --> 02:15:52,210
Not the same lady.
My goodness.

2981
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:54,610
Let's see.
But one person ever has told me I have

2982
02:15:54,611 --> 02:15:56,920
to take the fanny pack off and put it
under the seat.

2983
02:15:57,380 --> 02:15:58,360
Wait,
that is so stupid.

2984
02:15:58,361 --> 02:16:00,850
It's like connected to me since your
belt.

2985
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,800
It's like it's just a cook.
Top of pocket.

2986
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:05,500
Yeah.
Can I just put it in my pocket and you

2987
02:16:05,510 --> 02:16:07,430
dropped it in my pocket?
Yeah.

2988
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:09,770
I stuffed my fanny pack

2989
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:12,650
being a cunt.
But we've all seen that,

2990
02:16:13,250 --> 02:16:15,010
you know?
Yeah.

2991
02:16:15,610 --> 02:16:18,580
People remember that Airbus that used to
take you to Columbus.

2992
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:20,620
What was that bust?
It was Airbus.

2993
02:16:20,621 --> 02:16:23,650
There's called Airbus wasn't jet blue?
No,

2994
02:16:23,740 --> 02:16:26,990
no it wasn't jet blue airlines called
airpod there.

2995
02:16:27,030 --> 02:16:29,050
But yeah,
it was like $40 million when we.

2996
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:30,040
Once we

2997
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:35,040
took this shit once and the guy fucked
up his landing and had to start all over

2998
02:16:35,081 --> 02:16:38,500
again.
He went down and then pulled out and we

2999
02:16:38,501 --> 02:16:39,880
go back up again.
I was like,

3000
02:16:39,881 --> 02:16:43,600
this motherfucker just had a panicky tie
at that happened to me a few months ago.

3001
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:45,220
God.
But it was like,

3002
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:48,280
you know,
$40 a ticket so cheap.

3003
02:16:48,281 --> 02:16:50,950
And there was a direct flight,
which they don't have that they've one

3004
02:16:50,951 --> 02:16:52,450
direct flight to Columbus,
Ohio nowadays.

3005
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:53,433
Really?
Yeah.

3006
02:16:53,670 --> 02:16:57,280
That's why I had that happen to me a few
weeks or months ago or something.

3007
02:16:57,281 --> 02:17:00,790
And um,
and it was flying back home to la and

3008
02:17:00,850 --> 02:17:05,470
that was not cool.
It's a scary thing because you're,

3009
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:09,700
you get used to landing your first
whatever,

3010
02:17:09,701 --> 02:17:10,900
20,
30 flights.

3011
02:17:10,901 --> 02:17:11,890
They're like,
well we're landing,

3012
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:14,590
look out.
But then you get so used to it that,

3013
02:17:14,591 --> 02:17:15,550
you know,
what happens,

3014
02:17:15,551 --> 02:17:17,540
it's kind of a jerk a little bit.
But what,

3015
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:21,760
what's crazy is that to get it back up
after going down,

3016
02:17:21,761 --> 02:17:24,350
like they have to go full steam all the
way.

3017
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:28,000
Engines that are normally are actually
pretty chill because like a bird,

3018
02:17:28,001 --> 02:17:29,470
they sort of just,
you know,

3019
02:17:29,471 --> 02:17:32,950
you don't have to go full blast.
But when they do go full blast shit gets

3020
02:17:32,951 --> 02:17:35,650
crazy and they really had to do that
there.

3021
02:17:35,651 --> 02:17:38,770
I mean when you're,
we are down like we are very close to

3022
02:17:38,771 --> 02:17:43,771
landing but he was coming in too fast.
He said afterwards you just hear bond

3023
02:17:44,210 --> 02:17:45,990
on,
on Don,

3024
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:50,730
like engines and all of a sudden
everything's shaking and you're like,

3025
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:53,820
like that.
They had to like really pull apart.

3026
02:17:53,830 --> 02:17:55,450
It was scary man.
Rice.

3027
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:56,141
Yeah.
One of those,

3028
02:17:56,141 --> 02:17:57,670
like one out of every.
Whatever.

3029
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:59,770
Thousands.
That probably that happens too.

3030
02:18:00,050 --> 02:18:03,300
There was a trump plane that didn't have
the landing gear pop out once.

3031
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:05,570
Remember when trump had an airlines?
Trump airlines.

3032
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:06,530
Do you remember that?
No.

3033
02:18:06,770 --> 02:18:11,770
Trump ad trump airlines and they were
landing and the landing gear didn't come

3034
02:18:11,991 --> 02:18:15,950
down.
So they skid in like the bottom of the

3035
02:18:15,951 --> 02:18:18,470
plane,
just scraped against the ground.

3036
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:20,810
Sparks were flying.
Yeah.

3037
02:18:20,930 --> 02:18:23,060
Trump airlines.
Donald trump.

3038
02:18:23,210 --> 02:18:25,700
He had that airlines when he was younger
than me.

3039
02:18:26,990 --> 02:18:30,620
Like this motherfucker's been.
He's been rich for a long ass time.

3040
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:33,260
Look at them there.
Donald J dot trump.

3041
02:18:34,520 --> 02:18:36,890
Is that him in the police car?
That's Bobby Kennedy.

3042
02:18:37,190 --> 02:18:38,023
Is it?

3043
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:43,130
Um,
so 29th of September.

3044
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:45,720
You and I are in Columbus.
Oh yeah,

3045
02:18:45,970 --> 02:18:48,500
that's right.
The Fun at the palace theater.

3046
02:18:48,710 --> 02:18:51,890
And then we're at the tower theater in
Philly on October first.

3047
02:18:53,530 --> 02:18:56,000
And I'm at Boston's Wilbur theater.
October eighth.

3048
02:18:56,060 --> 02:18:58,280
Oh my goodness.
Tony Hinchcliffe.

3049
02:18:58,310 --> 02:19:00,860
Are you filming something there?
I'm going to try to.

3050
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:02,270
Yeah,
thinking about it.

3051
02:19:02,990 --> 02:19:05,300
It's just something we'll see.
We'll see what it turns out.

3052
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:06,820
It shows you doing that night to this
one.

3053
02:19:06,830 --> 02:19:08,900
Just one.
One in and out.

3054
02:19:09,020 --> 02:19:10,190
Whoa.
Easy Breezy.

3055
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:13,500
You can film it in my helmet.
Yeah,

3056
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:15,770
I got another spot.
That's good pot.

3057
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:18,830
Who knows what can happen while you were
well received last time you were there

3058
02:19:18,831 --> 02:19:19,730
with me.
Yeah.

3059
02:19:20,210 --> 02:19:21,830
Bunch of savages there.
That's my

3060
02:19:22,390 --> 02:19:24,460
city man as the people that like it.
Hard,

3061
02:19:24,461 --> 02:19:26,530
continuous rough.
No oohs.

3062
02:19:26,531 --> 02:19:28,590
And aahs Gacaca,
Gacaca Gacaca.

3063
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:31,250
Plus you're going to be there in
October,

3064
02:19:31,251 --> 02:19:35,390
which is like the last burst of
excitement before the freeze,

3065
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:40,070
like in November and December and
January and February and then march

3066
02:19:40,071 --> 02:19:42,080
people start coming back to life and
then guess where I'm going?

3067
02:19:42,081 --> 02:19:45,170
October 18th.
One bitch place I've been to with you

3068
02:19:45,171 --> 02:19:47,420
before.
We saw a little lady get kicked in the

3069
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:51,470
head place called Australia like I'm
headlining,

3070
02:19:51,471 --> 02:19:54,260
which shows all by myself.
Like a big boy.

3071
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:57,140
We did see a lady get ahead,
Sydney,

3072
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:01,490
Melbourne and Brisbane.
Beautiful of Australia or the end of

3073
02:20:01,491 --> 02:20:03,200
October in Australia.
Dude.

3074
02:20:03,470 --> 02:20:05,270
Yeah,
we did see or get kicked in the head.

3075
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:07,250
We did.
Are you going to that same place that we

3076
02:20:07,251 --> 02:20:09,650
went to in Melbourne?
I'm not exactly sure.

3077
02:20:09,651 --> 02:20:11,510
The venues.
I know I'm doing the comedy store in

3078
02:20:11,511 --> 02:20:12,980
Sydney.
You ever done that?

3079
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:15,110
The comedy store in Sydney?
I did do,

3080
02:20:15,111 --> 02:20:15,440
yeah.

3081
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:18,830
I did it with Ari.
We did a show at a theater and then on

3082
02:20:18,831 --> 02:20:23,831
Sunday we came back and did A.
I think what we did was the fights were

3083
02:20:24,021 --> 02:20:26,570
Sunday because the fights,
we're a day ahead,

3084
02:20:26,571 --> 02:20:30,470
but there were Sunday in the morning and
so that day we contacted the comedy

3085
02:20:30,471 --> 02:20:31,101
store and said,
Hey,

3086
02:20:31,101 --> 02:20:33,470
we want to do a show.
So we decided to do a show that night.

3087
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:34,910
That's what we did.
So yeah,

3088
02:20:34,911 --> 02:20:36,830
I definitely did it.
It's nice little club.

3089
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:40,030
I'm super excited because I guess like
that's the beginning of their summer,

3090
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:42,950
something at the end of October.
I don't think it gets cold though.

3091
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:45,530
I don't really get it as a joke like
summer,

3092
02:20:45,531 --> 02:20:46,430
winter.
It's a joke,

3093
02:20:46,431 --> 02:20:48,170
it's always warm,
like Australia,

3094
02:20:48,171 --> 02:20:53,171
like Sydney's pretty much perfect
whether they say it's like the Dallas of

3095
02:20:55,010 --> 02:20:58,570
Australia feel like,
like a show or the city.

3096
02:20:59,050 --> 02:21:00,860
The city of Dallas.

3097
02:21:01,710 --> 02:21:03,640
How did he remember that TV show?
But they,

3098
02:21:03,650 --> 02:21:05,060
um,
what do they call them?

3099
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:06,470
Cashed up.
Bogans.

3100
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:08,190
Do you want to cash out?
Bogan is.

3101
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:10,460
You're going to have to learn this
terminology.

3102
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:13,880
A cashed up.
Bogans is like a really rich redneck,

3103
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:17,210
like a.
If a guy in Dallas had like a,

3104
02:21:17,211 --> 02:21:20,090
a,
a jeep wrangler with fucking 45 inch

3105
02:21:20,091 --> 02:21:22,150
tires and a light bar on the roof.
And,

3106
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:26,360
and he's driving by the club with music
plan and he's got a rolex on with

3107
02:21:26,361 --> 02:21:30,250
diamonds on it,
but he's obviously trash that,

3108
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:34,130
that's a cashed up Bogan in America.
Get it.

3109
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:36,410
That makes sense.
I feel like there's gonna be some cashed

3110
02:21:36,411 --> 02:21:39,560
up bogans at some of my shifts.
They'll definitely be there for sure.

3111
02:21:39,830 --> 02:21:42,200
They're going to know you.
They're going to have woody think about

3112
02:21:42,201 --> 02:21:44,410
Cyborg.
Might she going to fuck you?

3113
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:47,300
You know,
often I get that by the way,

3114
02:21:47,301 --> 02:21:50,570
just randomly I was at the grocery store
the other day and someone hit me with

3115
02:21:50,571 --> 02:21:51,380
that.

3116
02:21:51,380 --> 02:21:54,950
You better look out and at the UFC on
Saturday.

3117
02:21:54,951 --> 02:21:56,680
I got it a couple times.
Actually.

3118
02:21:57,050 --> 02:21:59,210
It just got to find her and take a
picture with her.

3119
02:21:59,290 --> 02:22:01,190
He totally would make the Internet
explode.

3120
02:22:01,191 --> 02:22:02,780
He's everything to get you in a
headlock.

3121
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:05,710
Take a picture.
She could put me in a headlock.

3122
02:22:05,730 --> 02:22:10,730
I'll grab her deck and squeeze that
mother fuckers.

3123
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:14,600
You think
that this one?

3124
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:18,640
Come on.
Good Lord.

3125
02:22:18,990 --> 02:22:19,990
Amen.
You got it.

3126
02:22:19,991 --> 02:22:23,320
You got a shot at a the joker.
Now that jared Leto it Kinda.

3127
02:22:23,430 --> 02:22:26,340
They didn't enjoy him as the joker.
I thought he'd look great.

3128
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:29,160
He's a wonderful actor.
I don't know what went wrong,

3129
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:32,700
but he's not.
It's not really working out for America.

3130
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:34,910
Yeah,
there's a chance I'm.

3131
02:22:35,090 --> 02:22:37,910
I'm totally ready.
If you want to help me produce it,

3132
02:22:37,911 --> 02:22:38,890
we could do it.
Dude.

3133
02:22:39,350 --> 02:22:43,600
The one somebody made put that,
they put that head on a better joker

3134
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:48,260
body for that thing that he just
instagrammed and it's a better version

3135
02:22:48,261 --> 02:22:49,820
of it,
but I really want to do it.

3136
02:22:49,850 --> 02:22:50,570
Yeah,
that's true.

3137
02:22:50,570 --> 02:22:54,560
Squad movie was not well received.
I didn't see it when I saw that was

3138
02:22:54,561 --> 02:22:57,290
fucking good.
Hell or high water

3139
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:00,740
dude.
It's really good.

3140
02:23:00,820 --> 02:23:01,653
A Western right?
Yeah.

3141
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:03,690
It's Jeff Bridges.
And um,

3142
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:07,990
what is the named Ben Cohen?
Isn't the guy's name the Ben Foster?

3143
02:23:08,030 --> 02:23:11,600
Is that Ben Foster who's a really good
actor?

3144
02:23:11,601 --> 02:23:13,490
He's been in a gang of movies.
He's like,

3145
02:23:13,491 --> 02:23:15,890
one of those guys just steals movies in
the background.

3146
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:18,650
You know what?
He was awesome in one of my favorite

3147
02:23:18,651 --> 02:23:20,840
vampire movies ever.
I know it sounds ridiculous.

3148
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:23,180
Assigned a 12 year olds,
but 30 days of night,

3149
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:27,050
do you ever see 30 days of night?
There is him and that other dude,

3150
02:23:27,230 --> 02:23:28,610
the star wars.
Do Captain Kirk,

3151
02:23:28,611 --> 02:23:31,070
the new Captain Kirk.
Good fucking movie,

3152
02:23:31,071 --> 02:23:32,810
man.
Good fucking movie.

3153
02:23:32,811 --> 02:23:33,644
Fun.

3154
02:23:33,850 --> 02:23:36,580
I saw.
Don't breathe the other day in theaters.

3155
02:23:36,730 --> 02:23:38,500
And that's a good one too.
What's that?

3156
02:23:38,710 --> 02:23:43,000
It's about a bunch of kids that like go
around and steal stuff from houses and

3157
02:23:43,001 --> 02:23:45,910
then they find out that there's this old
Vietnam vet who,

3158
02:23:45,911 --> 02:23:49,990
uh,
who won a huge settlement and they have

3159
02:23:49,991 --> 02:23:53,440
a feeling that they,
that he probably has it in cash and they

3160
02:23:53,441 --> 02:23:57,190
show up to his house and you know,
he's blind.

3161
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:58,960
It turns out.
So they're like,

3162
02:23:59,050 --> 02:24:00,250
Ooh,
he's blind.

3163
02:24:00,251 --> 02:24:01,780
This is going to be fucking great.
Well,

3164
02:24:01,781 --> 02:24:05,890
the catch is he can hear you and he can
smell you.

3165
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:09,310
And whoa,
shit gets crazy.

3166
02:24:09,311 --> 02:24:13,060
Color is really good.
And who is he a bad motherfucker?

3167
02:24:13,061 --> 02:24:14,440
I don't know,
but I've been seeing him in my

3168
02:24:14,441 --> 02:24:17,770
nightmares and picturing his head poking
in my bedroom door lately.

3169
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:20,980
That movie Kevin Smith Made Red State,
I think it was called,

3170
02:24:20,981 --> 02:24:22,540
where he was like,
he was the preacher.

3171
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:23,920
Oh,
that guy's an excellent.

3172
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:25,660
What is his name?
I'll look it up.

3173
02:24:25,661 --> 02:24:27,760
I find out his name.
That guy is excellent.

3174
02:24:27,820 --> 02:24:30,220
He's so scary.
Have you ever see red state?

3175
02:24:30,221 --> 02:24:31,630
Like,
do you see that now?

3176
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:35,110
Do you see that one there were next to
the one that says don't breathe where

3177
02:24:35,111 --> 02:24:36,670
he's just walking by.
Alert me.

3178
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:38,260
Fuck,
don't you spoil.

3179
02:24:38,261 --> 02:24:40,350
But he's blind.
So Imagine Shanti.

3180
02:24:40,351 --> 02:24:41,640
Why don't you spoiled?
Well,

3181
02:24:41,650 --> 02:24:43,400
you got to see it.
You got to see that his death,

3182
02:24:43,410 --> 02:24:43,950
the guy from.

3183
02:24:43,950 --> 02:24:45,600
That's not the same guy.
That's a different guy.

3184
02:24:45,601 --> 02:24:47,790
That's the guy from Avatar.
Is he the guy from Avatar?

3185
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:51,210
He's the marine from Avatar.
Yeah.

3186
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:52,530
So you're thinking of a different guy,

3187
02:24:53,530 --> 02:24:55,210
but you also have to see death proof.
You have.

3188
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:58,210
You have to make up for that because
that's all about stunt cars and like

3189
02:24:58,240 --> 02:25:02,420
Kurt Russel kills it in this movie.
I feel like I told you it's like 28.

3190
02:25:02,421 --> 02:25:04,390
You have told me,
Brian,

3191
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:07,090
I love it.
Made me never put my legs up on the

3192
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:09,280
outside the window.
When you're in the room,

3193
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:11,470
there you go.
Saw Jungle Book,

3194
02:25:11,471 --> 02:25:12,370
right?
Yeah.

3195
02:25:12,430 --> 02:25:13,710
I didn't like it.
You didn't like?

3196
02:25:13,770 --> 02:25:15,090
No,
no.

3197
02:25:15,340 --> 02:25:16,830
He's a guy from avatar.
Not what I said.

3198
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:18,430
Steven Lang.
That's who.

3199
02:25:18,460 --> 02:25:20,380
Yeah,
he's a bad motherfucker to those guys.

3200
02:25:20,381 --> 02:25:22,120
Excellent.
He's excellent in everything.

3201
02:25:22,210 --> 02:25:24,130
Kills it.
And he's one of those guys

3202
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:27,170
that you just see in the background.
But uh,

3203
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:28,930
Ben Foster,
that's his name,

3204
02:25:28,931 --> 02:25:30,940
right?
That 30 days and night performance.

3205
02:25:30,941 --> 02:25:34,120
That's when I first found out about him.
He played like the vampire familiar.

3206
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:36,550
They had these vampires who would go to
Alaska because it wouldn't get.

3207
02:25:36,650 --> 02:25:39,610
You wouldn't get light out for a month,
you know,

3208
02:25:39,611 --> 02:25:42,190
there's like spots in Alaska where they
have like a never ending winter.

3209
02:25:43,010 --> 02:25:44,890
Do you ever Work Alaska?
No.

3210
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:45,930
Dude,
you got.

3211
02:25:45,970 --> 02:25:48,610
We got to do a Gig in the summer in
Anchorage.

3212
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:53,830
So it take me a trip now.
We need some more.

3213
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:58,540
It's hard enough for me.
I can't hold your hand,

3214
02:25:59,350 --> 02:26:03,110
but fishing is easy.
Fishing in Alaska is fucking awesome to

3215
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:05,140
go.
Salmon fishing and they do shows at

3216
02:26:05,141 --> 02:26:06,040
night.
You come out,

3217
02:26:06,190 --> 02:26:08,200
he'd do a midnight show.
It's 2:30 in the morning.

3218
02:26:08,201 --> 02:26:09,310
Go outside.
It's light out.

3219
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,770
That's cool.
Slight.

3220
02:26:11,890 --> 02:26:15,220
It's just barely gets dark.
It gets dark for like the tiniest amount

3221
02:26:15,221 --> 02:26:16,840
of time,
but it's not really dark.

3222
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:20,620
It gets like 7:30 PM dark and then it
becomes light again.

3223
02:26:21,130 --> 02:26:22,330
It's real weird.
I like it

3224
02:26:22,330 --> 02:26:24,760
that those are my hours that night as
well.

3225
02:26:24,761 --> 02:26:26,200
P when the sun's up for me.

3226
02:26:26,430 --> 02:26:29,730
Yeah.
Alaska is cool as fuck to anchorage and

3227
02:26:29,731 --> 02:26:32,790
particular people up there are super
nice,

3228
02:26:32,970 --> 02:26:35,040
like normal,
like fun.

3229
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:37,070
You can hang out with them and talk to
them and they're.

3230
02:26:37,071 --> 02:26:39,180
They're very.
They're hardy people.

3231
02:26:39,330 --> 02:26:42,050
You know what I mean?
Like there's not a lot of pussies that

3232
02:26:42,051 --> 02:26:43,800
live up there.
You just really can't.

3233
02:26:43,801 --> 02:26:46,710
You really can't be a pussy and survive
in Atlanta in Alaska.

3234
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:51,480
It's not the way the people are and it's
not the way the environment is like.

3235
02:26:52,230 --> 02:26:55,350
In order to survive in that environment,
you've got to be a self sustaining

3236
02:26:55,351 --> 02:26:56,970
person.
You've got to be able to change a tire.

3237
02:26:56,971 --> 02:26:59,450
You got to be able to dig yourself out
of a snow storm.

3238
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:02,910
You got to be able to start a fire.
He might have to make a nice tent,

3239
02:27:03,150 --> 02:27:07,380
one of those ice Igloos to survive.
That's where jewels from she is.

3240
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:10,740
Do you know her family?
Is the those people that are on that

3241
02:27:10,741 --> 02:27:12,210
reality show?
Yeah.

3242
02:27:13,450 --> 02:27:16,100
Somebody had the joke like they're like
the Kardashians.

3243
02:27:16,101 --> 02:27:16,940
If they were freezing,

3244
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:21,390
she seems very smart too.

3245
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:23,690
Jewel eminent and telling you,
man,

3246
02:27:23,691 --> 02:27:25,100
this was the one.
Like she,

3247
02:27:25,250 --> 02:27:28,610
I mean her and Peyton both like,
but like for example,

3248
02:27:28,611 --> 02:27:31,640
one of the cool things just like doing
sound check earlier in the afternoon.

3249
02:27:32,060 --> 02:27:34,340
She's just,
there was a part where like they had to

3250
02:27:34,341 --> 02:27:35,960
reload the prompter or something like
that.

3251
02:27:35,961 --> 02:27:38,840
She's just doing a run through,
but she did her performance with a

3252
02:27:38,841 --> 02:27:42,410
guitar in her hand and she would only
play in between while like people are

3253
02:27:42,411 --> 02:27:47,411
dying of laughter to
stop and she would start her next joke.

3254
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:48,920
Oh,
that's hilarious.

3255
02:27:49,190 --> 02:27:52,340
What a great idea.
I mean if you have all the writers of

3256
02:27:52,341 --> 02:27:53,660
the roasts,
the laughing,

3257
02:27:53,900 --> 02:27:56,240
then you did it,
you know what I mean?

3258
02:27:56,241 --> 02:27:58,460
Because we've,
we've been laughing about these jokes

3259
02:27:58,461 --> 02:28:00,980
for a week already.
So we're watching you.

3260
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:05,390
You're a third time saying them and
worse still cracking up.

3261
02:28:05,391 --> 02:28:05,760
Then

3262
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:08,130
what did you think about roast battle
being on television?

3263
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:11,880
Were you happy with the way it came out
or did you feel like it was too big?

3264
02:28:11,881 --> 02:28:12,330
And.

3265
02:28:12,330 --> 02:28:13,740
I love it.
I love it.

3266
02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:17,490
I think that it's going to get better.
I feel like that's like UFC one.

3267
02:28:17,550 --> 02:28:19,200
You know what I mean?
If that makes sense.

3268
02:28:19,530 --> 02:28:21,620
Because I think that it should be
regular.

3269
02:28:21,621 --> 02:28:24,320
I think that it should get bigger.
I think they shouldn't just make it a

3270
02:28:24,321 --> 02:28:26,540
once a year special event.
I want to see it every week.

3271
02:28:26,541 --> 02:28:30,110
I want to see it get bigger and breathe
and let it grow and get the cameras

3272
02:28:30,111 --> 02:28:31,940
right often.
Should they have Ralphie may back.

3273
02:28:34,070 --> 02:28:36,140
I don't think Ralphie,
we'll do it anymore.

3274
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:40,410
Do you think that they like the way
they're doing it right now and these big

3275
02:28:40,411 --> 02:28:42,000
environments,
do you think that it takes anything away

3276
02:28:42,001 --> 02:28:43,530
from it?
Like don't you think that like I was

3277
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:45,630
like,
I was watching it and I'm like looking

3278
02:28:45,631 --> 02:28:48,570
at where the judges are and the
performers are and everything's all so

3279
02:28:48,571 --> 02:28:50,770
lit up and I'm like,
this is not the belly room.

3280
02:28:50,771 --> 02:28:54,250
Like part of the beauty of roast battle
is how intimate it is.

3281
02:28:54,251 --> 02:28:55,860
You're preaching to the choir on that
one.

3282
02:28:55,950 --> 02:28:57,210
Why don't they just do it in the belly
room?

3283
02:28:57,680 --> 02:28:58,810
Air Preaching.
I mean,

3284
02:28:58,820 --> 02:29:01,820
I'm the guy that literally like,
I mean I've been annoying,

3285
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:04,250
you know,
Jeff and Brian and everybody about this

3286
02:29:04,251 --> 02:29:07,160
since they started eight years ago.
I literally was going,

3287
02:29:07,161 --> 02:29:10,610
you should be doing with this show what
we're doing with kill Tony and just get

3288
02:29:10,611 --> 02:29:11,480
it out there.
I mean,

3289
02:29:11,481 --> 02:29:12,670
and have.
If they had,

3290
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:17,630
if they put that thing on the Internet,
that would be huge,

3291
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:20,810
huge and people would be killed.
Be you get up.

3292
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:24,830
You become a bigger fan as you see it
more and you learn the characters more.

3293
02:29:24,831 --> 02:29:29,831
I mean there's like literally like 75
UFC analogies with this thing with roast

3294
02:29:29,901 --> 02:29:33,380
battle because you know there's
different styles and all this stuff and

3295
02:29:33,381 --> 02:29:36,500
you sorta have to be good at everything.
You have to be able to hit a rebuttal

3296
02:29:36,501 --> 02:29:41,420
and you have to be able to just do a
joke right in the pocket and you know,

3297
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:43,910
it's timing and execution and

3298
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:45,240
haters.
Table Two,

3299
02:29:45,241 --> 02:29:46,680
it's been,
it's been like clipped.

3300
02:29:46,681 --> 02:29:48,210
It's been edited.
It's been censored.

3301
02:29:48,211 --> 02:29:52,050
It's not the roast battle that we know
because it's kind of like the TV version

3302
02:29:52,051 --> 02:29:56,430
of a wave didn't make sense.
The racist stuff that scaple says is so

3303
02:29:56,431 --> 02:29:59,020
ridiculous and over the top.
What's so hilarious.

3304
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:01,650
Certainly some things aren't gonna make
it to comedy central.

3305
02:30:01,651 --> 02:30:03,180
They already have a limit to.

3306
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:05,890
They should have just done it on youtube
from the jump.

3307
02:30:05,980 --> 02:30:07,410
Totally.
Where the podcasts,

3308
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:10,630
you know you can download the podcast.
So that's that deaf squad and that's

3309
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:13,390
pretty roast battle.
It's called verbal violence.

3310
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:17,620
So we have the roast battle uncensored
on there so you can hear all the easier.

3311
02:30:17,621 --> 02:30:18,454
Everything.
Yeah.

3312
02:30:18,820 --> 02:30:21,250
How can you just talk about that?
Play the roast battles?

3313
02:30:21,310 --> 02:30:22,630
Yeah.
It's called verbal violence.

3314
02:30:23,180 --> 02:30:26,680
We're on like a lot of episodes.
We've been doing it for awhile.

3315
02:30:27,070 --> 02:30:28,990
How come you never talk about that?
I always talk about it.

3316
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:31,060
I've never heard you talk about that
once.

3317
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:31,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

3318
02:30:31,870 --> 02:30:35,290
I have literally never heard you talk
about a podcast where you take all the

3319
02:30:35,291 --> 02:30:36,124
roast battles.
Yeah,

3320
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:38,530
put it online.
It's the roasters all know they're being

3321
02:30:38,531 --> 02:30:39,550
put online.
Oh yeah.

3322
02:30:39,930 --> 02:30:42,100
It's been on for over a year.
It's,

3323
02:30:42,430 --> 02:30:45,670
you know,
Brian Moses and Jamie,

3324
02:30:45,671 --> 02:30:48,100
you know what,
coach t record them all or it sounded

3325
02:30:48,101 --> 02:30:50,950
pretty good.
Coach t does a real good job on it.

3326
02:30:50,980 --> 02:30:51,451
They,
they,

3327
02:30:51,451 --> 02:30:52,241
they,
they,

3328
02:30:52,241 --> 02:30:56,020
they is something like if Kim,
they'll have Kim as a guest can congdon

3329
02:30:56,230 --> 02:30:58,900
then they'll interview her about her
battle and they'll play the whole

3330
02:30:58,901 --> 02:31:00,010
battle.
And then uh,

3331
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:02,320
so they,
they make it like special events.

3332
02:31:02,321 --> 02:31:04,810
So it's not like last night's is gonna
be on there.

3333
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:06,640
They just pick out all the good ones.

3334
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:08,870
I think they,
they,

3335
02:31:08,970 --> 02:31:12,480
they interview the people and they'll
reflect on the battles that they don't

3336
02:31:12,481 --> 02:31:13,100
play the whole

3337
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:14,750
also the whole way through.
Yeah.

3338
02:31:15,220 --> 02:31:16,860
They don't play all of them now.
Like they'll pay,

3339
02:31:16,930 --> 02:31:20,930
they'll play the whole thing and then in
between interrupted literally just edits

3340
02:31:20,931 --> 02:31:22,680
it and does whatever he wants.
It cuts in and out of it.

3341
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:25,010
So it's good.
It's good for podcasts because they see,

3342
02:31:25,170 --> 02:31:28,350
they kind of have to explain some of the
battles because a lot of the battles are

3343
02:31:28,351 --> 02:31:32,430
inside jokes and stuff and so that,
that's why they have like kind of cuts

3344
02:31:32,431 --> 02:31:34,200
in between where they talked about how
you film it.

3345
02:31:34,690 --> 02:31:35,491
Uh,
they did.

3346
02:31:35,491 --> 02:31:38,670
They film it on periscope and she put it
on Youtube.

3347
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:40,080
Uh,
I think,

3348
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:43,120
I don't know why they don't do it.
It's something that they're allowed to

3349
02:31:43,150 --> 02:31:44,370
do that anymore.
Yeah.

3350
02:31:44,430 --> 02:31:46,410
Yeah.
With the comedy central deal in new

3351
02:31:46,411 --> 02:31:46,861
thing.
Yeah.

3352
02:31:46,861 --> 02:31:48,150
But they could have they been doing
this.

3353
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:51,320
That's what I'm saying is they don't.
Then I don't even think.

3354
02:31:51,490 --> 02:31:55,330
I don't think these networks get it yet,
that if they had,

3355
02:31:56,050 --> 02:31:59,290
if they had built a huge built in
following,

3356
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:02,560
then you get those numbers when they
switch over,

3357
02:32:02,561 --> 02:32:04,960
those people are always going to go find
the TV show.

3358
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:05,711
Well,
they figured it out.

3359
02:32:05,711 --> 02:32:07,150
What this has done happening.
Yeah.

3360
02:32:07,330 --> 02:32:10,180
They figured it out with red show
already show started out as a comedy

3361
02:32:10,181 --> 02:32:14,440
central Internet show,
which was basically uncensored and had

3362
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:18,040
much longer stories like Joe.
He could tell like a 10 minute story or

3363
02:32:18,041 --> 02:32:20,770
something on that,
whereas now everything has to fit into

3364
02:32:20,771 --> 02:32:23,680
those commercial breaks,
so they're editing a lot of stories,

3365
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:25,660
you know,
they chopped stories up and they short

3366
02:32:25,670 --> 02:32:27,910
numb and take a little of this out and
take a little of that out.

3367
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:31,800
The best way is to see him live,
you know,

3368
02:32:32,070 --> 02:32:33,040
especially roast battle.

3369
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:36,810
Same thing with the actual roast to.
I wish that it was more alive and you

3370
02:32:36,811 --> 02:32:41,010
would see like the highest and the lows
because it makes the highs a lot better.

3371
02:32:41,170 --> 02:32:42,270
Why don't they do them live?

3372
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:45,920
Want to just have a live event?
Is it too difficult to film a live TV

3373
02:32:45,921 --> 02:32:46,754
event?

3374
02:32:47,320 --> 02:32:48,410
It's expensive,
right?

3375
02:32:48,480 --> 02:32:51,840
There's a lot more expensive if they
just get to go in and really perfect it.

3376
02:32:51,930 --> 02:32:54,680
Like in that little bit that I did watch
last night,

3377
02:32:55,010 --> 02:32:55,910
I,
you know,

3378
02:32:55,940 --> 02:32:58,790
Joel Gallon,
the Aep of that roast who's done every

3379
02:32:58,791 --> 02:33:01,280
single roast,
all the MTV video awards,

3380
02:33:01,281 --> 02:33:05,030
like he's the guy,
he's a genius and to get to see the

3381
02:33:05,031 --> 02:33:08,510
reaction shots that he does match them
up with that.

3382
02:33:08,511 --> 02:33:10,910
You can only get like halfway there
live,

3383
02:33:11,330 --> 02:33:12,320
but to see,
you know,

3384
02:33:12,321 --> 02:33:15,560
you get more bang for your buck because
you get the joke,

3385
02:33:15,950 --> 02:33:19,940
then you get the reaction from the
person who was made fun of.

3386
02:33:19,970 --> 02:33:22,880
Then you get the audience and like if
you match all those things up,

3387
02:33:22,881 --> 02:33:24,680
right,
you get the joke reaction,

3388
02:33:24,681 --> 02:33:26,120
boom.
You have your laughing at like four

3389
02:33:26,121 --> 02:33:28,850
things at once.
So I think going in and doing the

3390
02:33:28,851 --> 02:33:31,160
surgery to that probably benefits the
show,

3391
02:33:31,161 --> 02:33:33,860
but still I think that's too long of a
turnover a week.

3392
02:33:34,220 --> 02:33:36,560
She'd be like the next night or
something they could do that.

3393
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:37,910
Tony's another show

3394
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:41,740
works best in that little room.
It's great in the big room,

3395
02:33:41,950 --> 02:33:43,750
but it's,
it's just not as good.

3396
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:46,770
We're getting better at it though.
We've been doing every other Monday in

3397
02:33:46,771 --> 02:33:49,890
the main room and it's getting big and
man cool.

3398
02:33:49,891 --> 02:33:54,870
We got Pat Reagan and Jeremiah Watkins
in is just has a different feeling when

3399
02:33:54,871 --> 02:33:56,730
you do the bigger ones.
It's getting bigger and better.

3400
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:59,370
We're getting better at it,
but what do you prefer?

3401
02:34:00,570 --> 02:34:02,550
It gets really?
Honestly,

3402
02:34:02,551 --> 02:34:06,240
I sorta like what we're doing right now,
we really should just take over Mondays

3403
02:34:06,241 --> 02:34:09,120
in the main room and commit to it and
have special ones,

3404
02:34:09,121 --> 02:34:11,040
you know,
like a chill one,

3405
02:34:11,041 --> 02:34:14,700
be in the belly room once in a while,
just a throwback episode because I'm

3406
02:34:14,701 --> 02:34:17,710
starting to fall in love with the main
room and I think that if we keep doing

3407
02:34:17,711 --> 02:34:17,980
it there,

3408
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:22,810
it's just going to keep getting bigger
and to have the chance of having 400

3409
02:34:22,811 --> 02:34:27,400
people every Monday at 8:00 PM,
like have it be like a fuck Monday's

3410
02:34:27,430 --> 02:34:30,130
show pretty much.
Which it's sort of turning into like we

3411
02:34:30,131 --> 02:34:32,610
had like 100 people that are on our last
night.

3412
02:34:32,611 --> 02:34:36,970
You got this amazing.
Now with dom I rera the old is the only

3413
02:34:36,971 --> 02:34:41,140
guest announced October.
I was perfect and murder just murder the

3414
02:34:41,141 --> 02:34:43,690
whole time.
Do you feel like there's something extra

3415
02:34:43,691 --> 02:34:46,450
creepy about watching so many bomb in
front of 80 people though?

3416
02:34:46,910 --> 02:34:51,070
Because like there's a feeling in the,
in the belly room when someone's eating

3417
02:34:51,071 --> 02:34:53,710
a plate of shit in the belly,
it's a different feeling.

3418
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:55,210
You hear their heartbeat.

3419
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:02,830
It's so fucked up that you smell them.
Smell the fear,

3420
02:35:02,831 --> 02:35:06,730
you smell their insecurities.
You see the sweat start to put more on.

3421
02:35:07,550 --> 02:35:10,810
Why do fuck stole that joke?
Who stole that idea?

3422
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:13,660
Why didn't someone steal the idea?
Oh,

3423
02:35:13,661 --> 02:35:16,780
the kill Tony.
I wouldn't say stolen.

3424
02:35:16,781 --> 02:35:21,781
I mean we'll see what happens,
but according to some of our friends in

3425
02:35:21,791 --> 02:35:24,510
New York,
like the guy who's doing it's cool and

3426
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:28,560
like wouldn't do that type of thing.
Who's at Ron Bennington?

3427
02:35:29,290 --> 02:35:32,230
It's an innocent guy,
it seems very cool.

3428
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:33,940
What do you know?
What I've heard though,

3429
02:35:33,941 --> 02:35:35,860
it's,
it's actually a company that just takes

3430
02:35:35,861 --> 02:35:38,410
a lot of west coast is ideas like roast
battles.

3431
02:35:38,411 --> 02:35:41,410
They made like a generic version of
roast battle afforded in east coast.

3432
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:43,570
Yeah.
And so they just kind of picking and

3433
02:35:43,571 --> 02:35:46,920
choosing what you,
what they want to steal and they rebrand

3434
02:35:46,921 --> 02:35:48,010
it.
But you know,

3435
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:50,380
I,
I was upset the first day or so,

3436
02:35:50,410 --> 02:35:51,240
but like,
like,

3437
02:35:51,240 --> 02:35:53,200
like Tony said,
let's just see what happens because it's

3438
02:35:53,350 --> 02:35:54,690
a big joker.

3439
02:35:54,700 --> 02:35:56,980
Sin and a couple other people were like,
you know,

3440
02:35:56,990 --> 02:35:59,240
like I got like,
I think Ari hit me up and it's like Yo,

3441
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:01,120
just laying a Bennington guys.
Cool.

3442
02:36:01,180 --> 02:36:02,200
Yeah,
let it die out.

3443
02:36:02,230 --> 02:36:05,530
And I'm like alright you got me because
I love those guys.

3444
02:36:05,531 --> 02:36:07,130
So I mean if they're saying that and you
know,

3445
02:36:07,140 --> 02:36:09,570
we're basically like others across the
country.

3446
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:14,290
It's sketchy though is because Joe Rogan
podcast has been on serious so you know,

3447
02:36:14,291 --> 02:36:16,660
for like the last couple of years,
I don't know if it's on anymore but they

3448
02:36:16,661 --> 02:36:20,200
used to rebroadcast it and for years
we've talked about killed Tony and the

3449
02:36:20,201 --> 02:36:23,260
format and stuff and the same show is on
the same network.

3450
02:36:23,261 --> 02:36:26,800
So that's an little kind of creepy.
We've had everybody on the show.

3451
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:28,480
Well listen,
you guys have been doing to kill Tony

3452
02:36:28,481 --> 02:36:30,310
for how many years now?
Over three years.

3453
02:36:30,670 --> 02:36:31,600
Everybody knows about it.

3454
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:34,270
It's not a surprise and it's an
interesting format.

3455
02:36:34,300 --> 02:36:38,020
It's a funny format in limiting them to
a minute.

3456
02:36:38,150 --> 02:36:40,510
It like gives plenty of time for
awkwardness,

3457
02:36:40,511 --> 02:36:43,810
but it doesn't let it get completely out
of control and that's the part where

3458
02:36:43,811 --> 02:36:45,160
they messed up.
Like if they were,

3459
02:36:45,300 --> 02:36:46,720
if they were going to,
if they were going to take,

3460
02:36:46,750 --> 02:36:50,110
if they were going to do it,
that's they made a huge fundamental

3461
02:36:50,111 --> 02:36:53,800
mistake because they just made it so
that the comedian I guess can just ring

3462
02:36:53,801 --> 02:36:56,710
a bell at any point.
Which of course these New Yorkers,

3463
02:36:56,770 --> 02:36:59,440
you know,
I think it's hilarious to probably

3464
02:36:59,441 --> 02:37:01,330
interrupt seven seconds thinking,
oh,

3465
02:37:01,331 --> 02:37:03,600
I got one full.
Yo know what I mean?

3466
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:07,810
Comedy just unstoppable.
Sure.

3467
02:37:07,870 --> 02:37:09,700
Anyway,
do you have a problem with New York

3468
02:37:09,701 --> 02:37:10,720
comedians?
And I mean,

3469
02:37:10,721 --> 02:37:12,160
I don't have a problem,
but like,

3470
02:37:12,650 --> 02:37:14,140
you know,
come on.

3471
02:37:14,320 --> 02:37:15,650
Anybody that knows what I'm talking
about.

3472
02:37:15,660 --> 02:37:16,320
No toss

3473
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:21,080
because west coast,
what's going on?

3474
02:37:21,081 --> 02:37:22,130
What is this?
The elbows,

3475
02:37:23,030 --> 02:37:24,310
shoulders.
What are you doing here?

3476
02:37:25,170 --> 02:37:26,820
You know,
they're the best out there.

3477
02:37:26,830 --> 02:37:30,230
You mocking New York comedians now you
seem to be mocking them

3478
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:34,730
west coast.
I just need to know to know where I

3479
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:37,680
stand.
I'm going to be in a East Coast soon and

3480
02:37:37,681 --> 02:37:40,070
uh,
in November and I don't want any issues.

3481
02:37:40,820 --> 02:37:42,800
I just want to say that I was born in
New Jersey,

3482
02:37:43,370 --> 02:37:45,230
uh,
identify with east coast in some ways.

3483
02:37:46,310 --> 02:37:51,290
I actually think east coast comics are
nicer and less back stabby and more real

3484
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:53,053
goal

3485
02:37:53,210 --> 02:37:54,670
to New York for a year.
Brian,

3486
02:37:55,310 --> 02:37:57,470
interesting.
You mean they're nice to you when

3487
02:37:57,471 --> 02:37:58,740
they're in town and want to do your job?

3488
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:00,540
No,
no,

3489
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:02,610
I just,
it's weird because out here it's like

3490
02:38:02,611 --> 02:38:03,660
you don't really,
you know,

3491
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:07,040
there's a lot of fake shit out.
Well that is true.

3492
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:11,780
This is a climate of fakeness with
auditions and you know,

3493
02:38:11,790 --> 02:38:14,970
meeting producers and all the bullshit
that comes with trying to be a working

3494
02:38:14,971 --> 02:38:17,760
actor in La.
It definitely tastes comedy.

3495
02:38:18,060 --> 02:38:19,710
You know,
there's a lot of people that you all

3496
02:38:19,711 --> 02:38:24,240
know that are like semi comedians that
do like a little stand up here and

3497
02:38:24,241 --> 02:38:26,190
there,
but they never record anything and the

3498
02:38:26,191 --> 02:38:29,130
occasionally go on the road.
But really what they do is they work as

3499
02:38:29,131 --> 02:38:31,950
actors and then they kinda like dabble
in comedy.

3500
02:38:32,430 --> 02:38:33,360
Right.
Those are all.

3501
02:38:33,570 --> 02:38:38,070
Those are weird fuckers because they're
not fully in and so the way they behave

3502
02:38:38,071 --> 02:38:41,040
and talk and think,
it's like just a little a shade off.

3503
02:38:41,310 --> 02:38:44,430
It's like a hybrid between an actor and
a comedian.

3504
02:38:45,370 --> 02:38:46,620
Yeah.
And they,

3505
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:48,220
you know,
I don't know.

3506
02:38:48,850 --> 02:38:50,140
You don't want different.
They're different.

3507
02:38:50,141 --> 02:38:51,010
In New York it's like,
hey,

3508
02:38:51,011 --> 02:38:53,080
I did 17 sets tonight.
It's like,

3509
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:54,280
oh,
well that's good.

3510
02:38:54,281 --> 02:38:57,310
Well how much do you.
How much value are you putting on those

3511
02:38:57,311 --> 02:38:58,990
17 sets?
So what?

3512
02:38:59,130 --> 02:39:04,130
I did one set at the comedy store and
know that this new two minutes works

3513
02:39:04,421 --> 02:39:07,780
exactly like this and like it's a higher
level.

3514
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:10,930
I don't know man.
It depends on how much time you getting.

3515
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:13,540
You know,
if you're doing 15 minutes of the comedy

3516
02:39:13,541 --> 02:39:14,970
store,
it's a,

3517
02:39:15,170 --> 02:39:18,100
it's a decent amount of time.
One of the problems with those short

3518
02:39:18,101 --> 02:39:21,640
sets is you're doing like five and seven
minute sets and there's a bunch of

3519
02:39:21,641 --> 02:39:24,460
people doing them.
Those are really hard to get anything

3520
02:39:24,461 --> 02:39:28,000
weird going.
They're really hard to express points of

3521
02:39:28,001 --> 02:39:30,970
view on things and like elaborate on
those points of view and have those

3522
02:39:30,971 --> 02:39:33,610
points of view tie in with other
ridiculous things that you noticed in

3523
02:39:33,611 --> 02:39:35,170
life.
You don't have enough time.

3524
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:37,970
I love New York comedians.
Don't get me wrong.

3525
02:39:37,971 --> 02:39:39,920
I'm just hating on this show
specifically.

3526
02:39:39,921 --> 02:39:42,220
Like what I heard of this show that's
like the.

3527
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:45,260
The people said whether kill Tony Rip
off is just a bunch of people ringing

3528
02:39:45,261 --> 02:39:50,000
the bell immediately and they don't even
let the poor comic even do their first

3529
02:39:50,001 --> 02:39:52,160
job without bashing them because
everything.

3530
02:39:52,230 --> 02:39:56,870
It's funny to interrupt course and so
like without that tension being built

3531
02:39:56,990 --> 02:39:59,990
over 60 seconds,
you don't know whether you like them,

3532
02:39:59,991 --> 02:40:03,080
whether you hate them,
you just know that this person on the

3533
02:40:03,081 --> 02:40:04,940
panels just being annoying.

3534
02:40:05,050 --> 02:40:06,310
Well when I,
when I do your show,

3535
02:40:06,311 --> 02:40:09,700
it's always this weird combination of
like try to be funny,

3536
02:40:09,701 --> 02:40:12,940
but this part of me that just wants to
give actual advice that's part of,

3537
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:14,040
it's like a balance of the

3538
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:17,610
two and then part of me wants to like
let people know like whatever you're

3539
02:40:17,611 --> 02:40:20,730
thinking is happening right now,
like whatever you think like this is

3540
02:40:20,731 --> 02:40:21,564
work,
this is,

3541
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:24,180
this is a mess.
Like someone needs to explain this to

3542
02:40:24,181 --> 02:40:26,010
you,
that this is all a mess and like if you

3543
02:40:26,011 --> 02:40:30,090
just through people bombing one after
the other,

3544
02:40:30,091 --> 02:40:33,120
after the other,
after the other and you thought that the

3545
02:40:33,121 --> 02:40:36,720
show was just bombers row.
And then finally we go to the bucket one

3546
02:40:36,721 --> 02:40:39,600
last time and there was one,
you know,

3547
02:40:39,601 --> 02:40:42,840
this young Black Guy,
22 years old that's been doing it for

3548
02:40:42,841 --> 02:40:46,740
five years.
Fuck in destroying.

3549
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:48,270
You're like,
Holy Shit,

3550
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:49,860
he's a wrestler.
He just,

3551
02:40:50,540 --> 02:40:53,340
he just moved here from New York.
He's not a wrestler and he was more.

3552
02:40:53,341 --> 02:40:55,260
He was,
he went to high school with Jon Jones.

3553
02:40:55,261 --> 02:40:59,580
He was wrestling in high school.
I wrestled in college and now he's grown

3554
02:40:59,581 --> 02:41:02,760
up and he's a killer.
He's common 22 years old.

3555
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:06,310
There's a lot of them out there.
Something shine.

3556
02:41:06,311 --> 02:41:08,400
David shine,
I think his name was now.

3557
02:41:08,401 --> 02:41:12,750
Do you think anybody bombs on purpose?
Is there anybody that goes out there and

3558
02:41:12,751 --> 02:41:14,990
purposely to kill Tony?
There's something.

3559
02:41:15,290 --> 02:41:17,820
There's been a few trolls.
I think people want to do good.

3560
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:18,691
I mean,
yeah,

3561
02:41:18,691 --> 02:41:20,730
there's been a couple trolls,
but they haven't.

3562
02:41:20,731 --> 02:41:23,190
They don't last a second.
I immediately get rid of them.

3563
02:41:23,850 --> 02:41:25,860
We can't just come on and like plug
something.

3564
02:41:26,040 --> 02:41:27,020
You're done.

3565
02:41:27,900 --> 02:41:28,733
