1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,910
Can we go four,
three,

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,290
two

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,990
on boom,
and now we're live.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,910
How are you sir?
I am wonderful.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,560
We had wonderful chat.
Ofsted.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,220
Yeah,
you probably would love to have had that

7
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:17,030
on here,
but I just.

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,770
No,
no,

9
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,460
no.
I would never want to do that to you.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,330
Yeah,
no idea.

11
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,100
Exactly.
I wouldn't want to do that too.

12
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,403
Yeah.
Yeah.

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,160
So listen man,
it's great to see you again.

14
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,480
It's good to see you again.
Been a while.

15
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,380
Yeah,
we,

16
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,590
I know.
We ran into each other once in a bar,

17
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,150
men with a random eye candy and I tell
her that what it's called.

18
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,990
I turned around and you turn around and
we made eye contact and eye candy.

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,610
That was a long time and still have to
be about 25 years ago.

20
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,444
Four years ago now,
right?

21
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,790
I know we talked about doing a podcast
back then even.

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,500
Yeah.
I'm glad we finally got together and do

23
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:48,620
it.

24
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,910
Let me too.
It's going to be fun.

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,760
You did that TV show that I did a long
time ago.

26
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:57,200
Joe Rogan questions everything and you
blew me away.

27
00:00:57,201 --> 00:01:02,201
You and me and Duncan and you showed us
all the tricks that people use.

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,970
Well you didn't.
You showed us that they were tricks,

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,300
but you didn't show us how to do the
tricks.

30
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,500
Broke one thing down for you,
but that was about it.

31
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:14,570
It was a psychological thing because
here's the thing,

32
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:14,961
right?
It's,

33
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:19,130
it's better to know that you can be
fooled rather than tell you how you can

34
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:20,900
be fooled and we'll.
We'll get into this about with

35
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:22,550
scientists and how I fold them in a
little bit,

36
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:26,600
but people always tell me,
why don't you just teach Paris the

37
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:30,500
tricks and the problem is,
is for every single trick that I have,

38
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,690
I probably have about seven or eight
methods,

39
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,550
so if I teach you one method,
Joe,

40
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,430
somebody else will come along and maybe
a method had been to key.

41
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,910
They'll do it a completely different
convincing way and you'll be looking for

42
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:43,670
that one method and you may say because
you don't have the experience,

43
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,830
you may say,
oh,

44
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,290
this has to be real.
I know how the tricks done.

45
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,830
They're not doing that.
They are actually doing something

46
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:53,720
completely different.
This has to be real,

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,810
so it's better to get an expert.
Let me ask you this one because my

48
00:01:56,811 --> 00:02:01,460
friend Eddie was at Venice beach and
this guy was doing.

49
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,970
He has like some save the rain forest
thing and he said,

50
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:09,971
if I tell you your birthday will,
will you listen to me and and donate

51
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:11,660
some money or something like that.
Right.

52
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,703
And he goes,
okay,

53
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,690
and he just goes May 15th.
Right.

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,180
Just straight out like that.
Yeah.

55
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:18,470
I just figured it out.
I'm like,

56
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,400
how could someone do that?
I can't tell you because I wasn't there.

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,990
There could've been other circumstances.
They could have been something you

58
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,880
overheard.
They could have been something he seen.

59
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:28,340
He may have been in the store when the
guy took his driver's license that they

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,920
could be.
There's a million things that could have

61
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:35,240
happened that your friend Eddie was not
aware of before that guy even walked up

62
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:36,680
to him.
So I can't.

63
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:39,140
I really can't answer that because it's
circumstantial.

64
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,840
And here's the other thing.
Does Eddie really remember everything

65
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:43,830
exactly the way that it was,
you know,

66
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,180
has he forgotten something and left
something out in that story because he's

67
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:50,300
told it so many times.
And usually here's the thing,

68
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:53,540
right?
When people want to convince you of

69
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,920
something,
they embellish and the more times they

70
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:00,400
tell that story,
that embellishment their reality,

71
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,050
they basically create a whole new
reality for themselves that they forget

72
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,380
that maybe they wrote it down,
they forget that maybe they said

73
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,810
something,
they forget that the person might have

74
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,670
asked specific questions.
You might've said,

75
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,320
yeah,
I get the feeling that you're probably

76
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,420
not born in the beginning of the year,
maybe later in the year,

77
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,950
maybe in the fall or something like
that.

78
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,450
Person says,
no,

79
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,100
but I am bought land.
Even the edit now,

80
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,210
you know,
it's the winter time,

81
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,980
so now you get within a few months right
there.

82
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,380
So there's,
there are always within mentalism,

83
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,780
which is what I am,
a mentalist and we'll explain what that

84
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,130
is in a minute.
But um,

85
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,300
there are ways to do those things and
there's many ways to do those types of

86
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,680
things.
So without being there,

87
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,550
I can't tell you exactly what your
friend Eddie experience to him,

88
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,960
it was very,
very real.

89
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,710
You don't believe in any psychic power.
I've started to say,

90
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,080
okay,
it's fair to say,

91
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,540
but if you just say it that way,
it sounds very cold.

92
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,370
It kind of sounds like I'm an asshole.
I'm a dick.

93
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,020
I'm a skeptic there.
Wait,

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,550
wait.
It can't because it means I'm not.

95
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:58,000
Haven't been open minded.
I am very open minded about these things

96
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,240
and whenever I investigating new
phenomena I opened,

97
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,660
I stepped back,
I put everything that I,

98
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:04,870
I think that,
hey,

99
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,820
it's not real.
I put that aside and go,

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,610
this could be the one.
I'm going to give him a chance,

101
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,790
but I'm going to look at it.
I am going to be a little bit skeptical.

102
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,020
I am going to do a double blind test.
I am going to step back and look at it

103
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:20,950
from a scientific point of view.
I'm not going to be stupid about this

104
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,960
and I'm not going to let them get away
with something.

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,620
And I also know they may be self
deceived and I've seen so much of this

106
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:30,220
type of phenomena that I usually know
what's going on when I do see it.

107
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:35,221
So I can honestly say that I've seen so
much phenomena and I've looked at so

108
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,800
much of it and I've seen the best people
out there and I've tested some of the

109
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:42,850
best people out there that I have not
seen anything indicative.

110
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
That psychic phenomena is genuine.
Have you ever heard of anyone who is

111
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,130
reasonably believable that it's seen
anything that counts?

112
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,150
I hear that all the time.
Right?

113
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:58,090
When you see a John Edward on tv or you
hear these,

114
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,760
these antidotes and stuff like that and
it's just like you're telling me about

115
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,580
Eddie.
So you're telling me that sounds like,

116
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,460
oh wow,
that person could be really psychic,

117
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,830
but I know that there's probably more
going on when that person.

118
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,300
I'm glad you answered the way you
answered because that doesn't make a lot

119
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,680
of sense that yeah,
you did tell stories and people do

120
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,600
forget how the story actually went.
The human memory is very flawed.

121
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,453
Oh,
absolutely.

122
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,430
Why?
We can change a person's memory,

123
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,170
you know,
there's been plenty of experiments that

124
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,200
have done on that.
If you take a certain group of people,

125
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,150
I can't remember what her name is.
It's just not coming to me.

126
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,980
I'm.
I have dyslexia as well,

127
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,740
which is really weird when you see what
I do on stage because I work with

128
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,780
numbers,
I work with names and they use a lot of

129
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:38,620
mnemonics for these things,
so I really hard time recalling names

130
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,840
and books that I read and stuff like
that.

131
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,550
I just.
It's really hard to come to me,

132
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,480
but it takes a while for those things to
your work.

133
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,280
Like what does it does?
I always thought that it switched things

134
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,050
a girl.
I did it in high school at it.

135
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,730
It does switch things around.
Oh,

136
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,950
it's one of those things like if I'm
working with numbers,

137
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:55,030
I can't.
I don't even.

138
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,430
I think what it is is I got so
disappointed numbers when I was young.

139
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,000
I love numbers.
I love the fact that everything in the

140
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,410
world,
his numbers I.

141
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,740
I love the idea of numbers of what they
do,

142
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,250
but I think when I was young I would get
so frustrated even in high school and in

143
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,000
middle school I would do math problems,
but I would figure out a way that worked

144
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,820
for me to do the math problem and then
the teacher would come up,

145
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,020
they say like,
show your work,

146
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,520
and I would put it down and they'd say,
no,

147
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,270
that's wrong.
I've got,

148
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,600
but I got the right answer yet,
but that's not the way we do it.

149
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,050
You need to do it this way.
And the normal way of doing things was

150
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:34,640
extremely difficult for me to switch.
It switches numbers around,

151
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,310
you know,
and if you're trying to switch the

152
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,040
letters for me,
I'll use words that are the wrong words.

153
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,270
I could be talking to you during this
podcast and then I'll listen to the

154
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,800
podcasts and I'll go,
oh my god,

155
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,200
why did I use that word?
You know,

156
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,460
I,
I had a thing where,

157
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:52,100
um,
I'll give you an example of the type of

158
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,430
things that happened to me.
I have a line when I say,

159
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,060
uh,
in,

160
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,190
in some of my shows where I say,
uh,

161
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,890
I read thoughts,
not minds.

162
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,300
What do I mean by that?
Husband and wife are sitting on a park

163
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,550
bench,
pretty gold goes jogging by husband,

164
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:07,430
turns his head and looks wife,
slaps the husband in the face.

165
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,950
We know what the husband was thinking.
We know what the wife was thinking,

166
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,690
right?
We haven't read their minds but we do

167
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,510
know what their thoughts are.
So it's sort of that body language

168
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,880
thing.
And I remember one time doing this for a

169
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,980
skeptic's group and I was on stage and I
was like,

170
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,030
husband wife is sitting on a park bench,
pretty girl walks by husband slaps the

171
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:26,440
wife in the face.
So I said it exactly the opposite of the

172
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,100
way.
And they just thought it was a joke.

173
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,250
Like they thought I was being stupid and
just just a joke.

174
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,330
But I do that kind of stuff consistently
and I have a really hard,

175
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,280
like if you say so a lot of people will
do that,

176
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,280
but it's really bad for me.
Like I do.

177
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,860
I do it consistently,
you'll,

178
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,030
you'll,
you'll talk about things and I hear you

179
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:48,920
talk about things and you'll use words
that I actually know what the word

180
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:51,020
means,
but if I wanted to recall that word and

181
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,970
use it,
cannot remember it,

182
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:54,200
but what's the mechanism like?

183
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,780
What is happening in your mind where it
switches things around?

184
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,070
I'll call it dyslexia.
I don't know.

185
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,940
For me it's just they call it with me,
it's the effect and it's a really fucked

186
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:05,571
up word,
right?

187
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:09,020
For dyslexics to use dyslexia.
Like when they come up with a better

188
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,200
word for that.
It's really hard for dyslexia.

189
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,960
That's the way it is with all that
stuff.

190
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,830
But it's like I got to list,
there's an s in there.

191
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,280
It's like,
why?

192
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,930
Why,
why?

193
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,360
That's true.
Um,

194
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,580
so,
so you,

195
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,270
is there anybody that like,
I mean there's the James Randy

196
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:29,970
challenge,
right?

197
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,410
Famously were which I was in charge of
the million dollars and I tested many

198
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,340
psychics,
but I guess what I should do is probably

199
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,141
we're in charge of it.
How?

200
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,930
So?
Let's go back to the beginning.

201
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,240
So you understand how I got here on this
journey,

202
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,060
if that's okay.

203
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,690
All right.
And I'll talk about a couple of personal

204
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,540
things in the very beginning.
So I was born in 1960,

205
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,490
so I'm 58 years old,
you know,

206
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,170
so yeah.
Uh,

207
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,700
and uh,
I was born in England,

208
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,830
left there and came to the United
States.

209
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:58,680
My mom divorced my dad in that year,
went back to England and I'm giving you

210
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:01,740
this so you understand where I'm coming
from and how I got on this journey.

211
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,170
Uh,
she had two kids.

212
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,170
Uh,
we immigrated to South Africa in 1969.

213
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,960
She abandoned me in South Africa that
time with my two brothers a year and

214
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:11,580
three years old.
We had a stepfather who was an

215
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:14,250
alcoholic.
We saw and maybe on Sundays maybe if I

216
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:15,540
drag them in from the car into the
house,

217
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,730
we would see him then.
So I was changing diapers.

218
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,830
I was taken care of my brothers and so
forth.

219
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,220
Wow.
Uh,

220
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,790
and I was there until I was 15 years
old.

221
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,810
Now it was during that time that I,
I heard a guy by the name of Eric

222
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,050
[inaudible] who was a famous psychic and
he's the first one to claim that he

223
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,000
could actually been objects with his
mind,

224
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,680
like silverware and became really famous
for it.

225
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,550
He was supposedly a.
They did research with him at standard,

226
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,450
a stanford researcher at Stanford,
Stanford,

227
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,370
Stanford Research Institute,
and he was using that sort of as an

228
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:48,420
endorsement to say that he was genuine
and one of the things that gala did was

229
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,180
he said if you bring metalogics to the
radio,

230
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,000
you can get them to bend as well.
So I mean,

231
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:57,340
think about my radio
on the radio.

232
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
There was no talking,
there was no tv there at the time.

233
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:03,450
They had Springbok TV,
they didn't have the actual station,

234
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,780
but they were putting it up and they had
tvs in the store at the time,

235
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,750
but they were playing Papaya,
vhs movies back then,

236
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:10,430
you know,
on the one.

237
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,850
However they played it back then,
but no TV station.

238
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,510
So that was the thing.
Everybody there listened to the radio

239
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,820
and he's like,
if you bring it to the radio,

240
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,250
you can do it with the unleashed powers
of your mind.

241
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:22,260
You can get metal,
and so I went around the house.

242
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:27,261
I found a little pin and my mom's old
sewing kit and I held it up and I looked

243
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,530
at it and I studied it and I
concentrated on it and it bent well on a

244
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,560
micro level.
At least I thought it bends,

245
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,280
so I convinced myself that it had been
my noodly and another that years later,

246
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:43,281
but in my mind I had got that to happen.
From there I went to Australia to go be

247
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:47,520
with my biological dad and from there to
Colorado and it was while I was in

248
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,680
Colorado that I picked up a book by
James,

249
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,100
the Amazing Randy and that book said the
truth about Uri Geller.

250
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,910
And in fact the book was changed.
The name was changed years later to the

251
00:10:56,911 --> 00:11:00,120
truth about the truth of Uri Geller from
the magic of Uri Geller.

252
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,570
And that book basically said that early
was a magician posing as a psychic and

253
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:10,080
no adult had ever told me that before.
All the adults that I did know they

254
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,180
believed in early.
So I believe in is one I learned a

255
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:14,520
valuable lesson just because people in a
position of authority,

256
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:17,970
because there are adults that old or new
doesn't make everything they say

257
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,370
correct.
Which I learned it that way.

258
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,590
Um,
because keep in mind I was really

259
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:25,380
socially inept because I was always
taking care of my brothers.

260
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,750
I had no free time,
so I wasn't hanging out with other kids.

261
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:29,190
I wasn't doing those things.
I had a great life,

262
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:31,920
don't get me wrong,
I had a really great life in South

263
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,570
Africa.
I did stupid stuff like jumping off

264
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:34,920
bridges into trains.

265
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,000
This will,
we get apples,

266
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,220
I have apples to eat at home and stuff
like that.

267
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,840
Jump off the train and take it home.
So those were great things.

268
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,790
Those are great times actually believe
even though it sounds like it's really

269
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,624
sad,
it's not.

270
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,260
So anyway,
I read this book and in the book,

271
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,140
uh,
Randy sort of mentioned eludes to a

272
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:55,620
method for bending a nail and so I
picked the,

273
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:57,790
I got some nails,
I started creating my own ways.

274
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:01,420
I'm sort of a problem solver.
I can you give me something you want to

275
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,150
do and I can go ahead and figure out a
way to do it.

276
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:06,530
It's why I worked for people like Chris
Angel and you know,

277
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,510
David Blaine open his second TV special
with one of my effects and I'm the first

278
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:14,380
person to be buried alive six feet on
the ground shaman handcuffed in a coffin

279
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:17,470
and dig my way to the surface,
which I've done twice and almost died

280
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,490
twice during that.

281
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,230
Um,
but anyway,

282
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,600
getting back on track here.
So we'll get back to that later.

283
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,120
Yeah.
So I to hear about that.

284
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,440
So I wrote,
just gloss over that sir.

285
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:30,820
I'll gloss over a whole bunch of crap.
I've done crazy crazy stuff where I

286
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,770
should be dead.
I look back now and I go,

287
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,730
I am really.
I mean,

288
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,070
even when I was a kid,
I was crawling down just just,

289
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,370
just to do it.
I'd look at the top story window and I'd

290
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:41,410
go,
I think I follow down that drain pipe.

291
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:44,680
I think I can do it upside down and I
would actually climb upside down using

292
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,190
my feet to keep myself up there and
climb down the drain pipe to get down.

293
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:49,330
So I did a lot of dump,
dump,

294
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:51,010
dump stuff.
Um,

295
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,420
so I was in high school and I started to
create methods for bending silverware.

296
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,680
So much so that all the kids there went
to plastics are being,

297
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,040
their school actually went to plastic
silverware because all the kids in there

298
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,470
we'll bring in all their silverware to
me.

299
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:05,050
So we were getting low and silverware.
Um,

300
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,910
they went to plastic silverware.
I got in trouble.

301
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,210
You were bending the silverware with
your mind,

302
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,210
is that what you're saying?
Well,

303
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:14,080
I was making it.
I was using tricks to make it look like

304
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:15,330
I was bending it with my mind.
Yeah,

305
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,200
I was crazy.
I was basically doing what Gallo is

306
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:20,020
doing.
Only the difference was is I didn't

307
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:22,510
realize it,
but until I saw yellow I was.

308
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,260
I'd never seen Gallo work.
I just heard about him on the radio and

309
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,480
I heard you're supposed to see the metal
band,

310
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,870
so in my mind the effects that I created
to bend metal,

311
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,900
you actually saw the forks and the
spoons and that bending and if you see

312
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:38,440
any magician working today,
more than likely they're using a couple

313
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:42,560
of my techniques to make metal look like
it's actually bending A.

314
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,280
I even figured a way to make the school
bell go off so we can get out of school

315
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:46,450
early.
I got suspended for that.

316
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,180
Why don't you do that?
Because I could know how.

317
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,150
Oh,
how'd you do that?

318
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,960
There was a,
there was a wire and there was a short

319
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,050
that goes through this one classroom
that I was in and I was able to figure

320
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,120
out how to exactly how to get that short
to work with.

321
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:00,510
The bell would go off and we got out of
school early.

322
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:02,650
It was just connecting the two and it's
like you and connect.

323
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,210
You connect and it goes off,
so it was like,

324
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,811
Whoa,
okay,

325
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,690
this is great and good that I with the
clock up on the wall,

326
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:11,950
if you look at a clock,
I realized that as the clock hand goes

327
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,760
around all the way around,
it looks like it's slowing down when it

328
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:16,390
comes back up.

329
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,460
It's not.
It's just an optical illusion from one

330
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:20,350
side,
so I would make kids think that I was

331
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:24,490
making the clock slow down and I figured
a way on an old time timex watch that I

332
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:28,960
used to be at a way that if I pulled the
stem out and slowly turned it backwards

333
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:31,900
and pushed it in,
the secondhand would keep moving for

334
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:35,620
about 35 seconds and then it would just
start like going click,

335
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,491
click,
click,

336
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:39,130
and then it would stop so I could put my
watching somebody's hands.

337
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:42,100
So I come up with all these different
methods for accomplishing all these

338
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:44,560
different feats.
I started learning how to do a thing

339
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:46,960
called muscle reading,
which we can talk about in a little bit.

340
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,130
Muscle reading.
Yeah.

341
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:51,170
It's like if it's an old,
old technique that nobody uses and I was

342
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:53,720
really surprised that people were not
using it,

343
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:57,440
but it was really,
really popular back in the late 18

344
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,720
hundreds where if you.

345
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,500
If I take your wrist and it's based upon
the idiomotor response,

346
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:06,890
if I take your risks and I tell you,
look at my other hand and I want you to

347
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:10,670
imagine it actually touching an object.
Think of one of these objects,

348
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:13,550
five objects on a table.
Think of my hand actually touching it

349
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,840
and I move my left hand,
which you're not holding here.

350
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:19,610
Actually I'm holding who you with my
right hand,

351
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,590
but I'm moving your hand in sync with
it.

352
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,300
I will.
If you're thinking,

353
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,100
go to the left,
go to the left or the left.

354
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,170
I can actually feel the resistance when
I go to the right in your arm so you

355
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:31,490
give off this,
this,

356
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,120
this thing that lets me know exactly
where to go and you could kreskin did it

357
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:37,760
with his check.
He would hide the check and and before

358
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:41,210
that polgar did it with his check and
I've done it with my check when I do

359
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:44,720
shows in the past where they can hide
your check anywhere in the theater.

360
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,440
You take somebody's head and you tell
them to think of my other hand and they

361
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:51,590
have to know where the objects hidden
and think of that hand actually going

362
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:54,320
there and touching it and you can
actually find the object.

363
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,250
So I was doing a lot of muscle reading
back in those days and everybody.

364
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,690
What about you get some stone cold
psychopath?

365
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,540
Not No.
They.

366
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,910
They have to really truly be thinking it
and wanting it to happen and that's why

367
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:08,690
I reframe it in the aspect of you see me
do things with my mind.

368
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,640
I want you to try and do something with
your mind.

369
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,670
Will this hand to actually touch that
object so they do and they don't realize

370
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:19,310
that subtly there pushing and pulling
you in the right direction and you can

371
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,740
even say them,
don't pull me in the direction.

372
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,090
Let me pull you,
but you're still pulling and pushing

373
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:24,740
with them and you can find the actual
logic.

374
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,320
And so I wrote a book on it.
It's called psychophysiological thought,

375
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,910
reading psychophysiological
physiological reading,

376
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,870
lot reading,
which is isolating.

377
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,480
I didn't know that.
What I did was we call it bustle,

378
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:38,540
reading in the business and in the
business.

379
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,190
Yeah.
And I started looking at some of the

380
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,520
older terms for it and I found that term
psychophysiological thought reading.

381
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:47,060
I thought that's a great name for the
book because every book I've written on

382
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:49,220
mentalism,
because I write books that teach people

383
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:52,940
and video I have.
They all start with a pea size series,

384
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:53,471
you know,
it's,

385
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:53,931
it's.
Yeah.

386
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,210
So it's all I've talked to,
you know,

387
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,440
I've talked to penn about magic and
about illusions and,

388
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:01,310
and he's,
you know,

389
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,000
funny about it and he laughs and says
it's all lies and bullshit and you know,

390
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,870
he makes it seem fun,
but the way you described it,

391
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,160
it became a little bit more compelling
because you're,

392
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:14,150
you're,
you're seemingly obsessed with it.

393
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:19,580
Like obviously to get as good as you got
at becoming a mentalist like you,

394
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,310
you had to be like,
even the way that you rattle off things

395
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:24,650
you,
there's very little pause to you.

396
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,970
You stop and start and I talk too fast.
I know everybody says you talk.

397
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,220
We don't talk too fast.
You just talk fast.

398
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,420
Yeah,
I mean I can hear you.

399
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,360
It's very clear.
But that's also what I noticed when you

400
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:38,000
were doing the reading,
when we did it in front of the crowd of

401
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:42,980
people and you were able to pick out
certain things that didn't make the air

402
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,530
because it didn't fit the format of the
show at that time.

403
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,500
One of the things,
what,

404
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,520
what Joe Joe's talking about is there's
a part in the show where I ask people

405
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:52,800
just to think of things.
Um,

406
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:56,190
and then I start getting initials and
then I get names and then I get,

407
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,851
um,
yeah,

408
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,650
you're,
you're actually thinking about your

409
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:03,400
grandmother and how you went on a bike
ride with her through certain forests.

410
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,260
Then went to Lake Chelan pull pack and
your birth date is this and that.

411
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:09,420
And I did a birthday freaking stuff
there.

412
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,254
Yeah.
Yeah.

413
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,910
But it was the weirdest thing is like
they,

414
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,130
they're also overwhelmed by the fact
that you never stopped talking like it

415
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:18,710
just,
it's just ready go pro.

416
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,480
It just keeps coming like,
Huh,

417
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,990
how do you know that?
And then,

418
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:22,500
no,
don't,

419
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,970
don't worry about that.
We'll get that to the minute,

420
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:24,810
you know,
where that comes from.

421
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:27,440
Jail.
That comes from back in my early days I,

422
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,310
I,
um,

423
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,760
well in the very beginning.
Well let's,

424
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,410
let's get you in with the story.
I'll get to,

425
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,770
I'll get to that to where I work the
places because that sort of comes from

426
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:38,760
working the comedy clubs and some really
Shitty shitty places and having to grab

427
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,060
people's attention.
Um,

428
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,180
so from there I ended up writing randy
and letter a just out of the blue

429
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,340
because I was getting a little cocky I
guess at young,

430
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:48,870
you know,
that age because I was getting away with

431
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:49,540
all this stuff.

432
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,580
And Randy let,
I said,

433
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:51,900
look,
if you ever need a kid to try to

434
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:54,060
convince scientists,
this stuff is real,

435
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,260
I would be happy to so long as I come
out and say it's a hoax at the very end.

436
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,890
I had a couple of hypothesis,
um,

437
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,960
and one of them was at scientists
implemented for years.

438
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,780
There's no evidence of the esp on a
proper scientific controls.

439
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,270
And this is back in the eighties because
a lack of funding,

440
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,450
it was my contention had nothing to do
with funding.

441
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,210
You have to do with the scientists were
going with the pro biased opinion and

442
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:18,240
they would documenting their own beliefs
rather than using proper science.

443
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,030
First of all,
to find out if it was even genuine.

444
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,480
So they were not using the proper
scientific method.

445
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,820
They would basically just saying,
I believe this is real.

446
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,880
I'm going to get it on tape or I'm going
to get it to where I can document it.

447
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,170
So the rest of the world that slowly
down where they biased towards believing

448
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,840
that it was real or fake,
no believing it was real.

449
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,180
Because you don't get.
Usually you don't get into Paris

450
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:41,970
psychology unless you have an interest
in it and usually you don't have an

451
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:43,830
interest in it unless you think there's
something there.

452
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,380
Right.
Do those ghost shows drive you fucking

453
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,220
crazy?
Yeah,

454
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,650
they do.
Because I know I've actually been.

455
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,250
I've actually been called to work on a
couple of them behind the scenes that I

456
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:54,031
always tell them,
no,

457
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:56,550
I can't do it,
and I have some friends that have worked

458
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:00,570
on them behind the scenes to try to make
some of the investigators freak and

459
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,780
they're using magic tricks to get the
investigators freak and the great thing

460
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:07,290
about those kinds of shows is you only
need to do one little thing,

461
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,570
just something falling off a shelf
because it just.

462
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,830
That's all you need,
right?

463
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:11,880
I mean it's like,
yeah,

464
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:15,520
there's a ghost.
It fell off the shelf because they play

465
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:19,140
that tape over and over and over again
and they show a little shadow or

466
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,210
something like that.
There's nothing dumber on television

467
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:23,760
now,
now and and smarter than I know for a

468
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,710
fact.
There are people that work behind them,

469
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,680
behind those scenes at fooling those
guys.

470
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:30,520
When we work,
I work with Chris Angel a lot.

471
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,560
Alright.
Uh,

472
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:34,740
the early days I worked with him on
almost all of his EPA shows.

473
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:39,390
I've done over a 100 episodes of
television with Chris and we,

474
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:42,930
every year we would do one episode that
was a silence episode,

475
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:45,120
that type of thing.
And uh,

476
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,390
we brought a group of researchers in and
the moment they got off the bus,

477
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:52,330
we had all this stuff set up and
everything else to mess with them.

478
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,410
The moment they got off the bus,
I told my guys,

479
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:55,860
I said,
we're not using any of that which is

480
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,180
going to use pure psychology with these
people.

481
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,530
And that's what happened because I could
tell they was,

482
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,440
they was such believable.
Anything I suggest to them they're going

483
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:09,040
to go for.
So let's say we have six rooms and I

484
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:14,041
need this one room to be the room that
is haunted because that's a story that

485
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:18,010
goes on behind it with something else
that's already been said and position or

486
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,740
it's got to match up with a bunch of
celebrities who feels something in the

487
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:24,340
room as well.
All I gotta do is once we go in to,

488
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,160
you know,
you fill anything,

489
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,410
so yeah,
I feel a little haunting.

490
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,510
I feel this and that,
you know,

491
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,890
this room I really want you to take time
with.

492
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,180
That's all I have to say.

493
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,950
And it's the psychics getting headaches
and they just,

494
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,340
they go,
they go crazy because I've already put

495
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:37,520
it in their head at that point.
Okay.

496
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,950
So the stuff they come up with is going
to be much more believable than any of

497
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:44,800
the little tricks that we had,
like hidden recordings and stuff like

498
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,900
that.
The stuff they come up with is going to

499
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,900
be much more believable and much more of
a hit.

500
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:55,090
Are there any real like supernatural
investigators that actually believe in

501
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:58,880
ghosts or they all come?
People know there's people investigators

502
00:21:58,881 --> 00:21:59,651
that believe in it.
Yeah,

503
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,720
absolutely.
They'll show,

504
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:04,390
isn't it?
They must know they're fucking think.

505
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,760
Yeah.
Like,

506
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,720
um,
uh,

507
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,250
what is it?
A paranormal state was one of them,

508
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:09,901
you know,
and,

509
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:10,770
and I,
I think it's,

510
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:13,270
some of them are a little abusive too
because they work with little kids

511
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:16,700
sometimes and they talk the kids into
believing these things and,

512
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,450
and,
and it's just,

513
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,510
some of them are a little bit.

514
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,220
Yeah,
there's a little creepy little creepy

515
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:24,160
what they do to them and you know,
they usually don't have a psychologist

516
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:28,030
taking care of the people afterwards to
work them through it and it's just,

517
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,260
it's the psychologist I do is also a
paranormal investigator that believes in

518
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:35,380
these kinds of things and it's going to
come at it a very slanted angle.

519
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:39,610
So I've not seen a single one of these
shows that I don't look at it and go

520
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,270
bullshit and just end up turning it off.
So yeah.

521
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,190
Now did they,
I mean,

522
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,790
but is there anybody who like
legitimately,

523
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,050
like anybody who's a reasonable person
who legitimately believes in ghosts and

524
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:56,920
legitimately believes in every movie,
every haunt horror movie.

525
00:22:56,921 --> 00:23:01,690
There's always like this one real
researcher that there are people like

526
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:02,890
Lloyd Lloyd,
Alabama,

527
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,080
and you know,
who I know is he believes in this kind

528
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:05,914
of stuff too.

529
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,050
And you have a tumor.
No,

530
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:11,710
it doesn't have a tumor
as far as I know.

531
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:13,010
He does not have it too.
A nice.

532
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,250
He's a nice guy.
I respect a lot of these guys.

533
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:17,350
I get along with it.
I think you have to,

534
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:18,910
right?
Because you've got to be at a debate

535
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,980
with these people.
You got to be able to talk to them and

536
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:24,460
if you show them respect,
they're going to show you reason with

537
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:28,620
them and sort of explain why what
they're doing is faulty or we,

538
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,440
we have,
we have,

539
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,870
we have conversations about certain
things,

540
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:33,370
certain type of testing,
you know,

541
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,204
and,
and how,

542
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,380
how ridiculous some of these things are.
And,

543
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,370
and,
um,

544
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,280
but you know,
they're going to be convinced that

545
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:41,620
there's something there.
Even if it's a little little something

546
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:44,680
like one little thing,
you can't quite knock out a way where

547
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,553
they can do.

548
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,970
I mean,
it's like when I worked with a pat,

549
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:50,780
so back then Washington University in
1979,

550
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:53,500
James McDonald gave a half million
dollars to washing university.

551
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,080
All right?
And that was shortly after I had wrote

552
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,110
Randy that let him and now James
Mcdonald,

553
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,360
he was Mcdonald aircraft,
uh,

554
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,200
you know,
the banshee and all those different

555
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,030
types are all named after spirits by the
way.

556
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

557
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,000
So if you take,
if you do your research,

558
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,970
you'll find all these things.
So he really truly believed in,

559
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,590
in,
in the afterlife.

560
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,760
And His thinking was,
look,

561
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,760
if they can find something that's even
psychic,

562
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:19,340
that might be indicative that maybe
there's an afterlife,

563
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:20,870
you know,
at least it's indicative that something

564
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:23,660
supernatural paranormal.
There are things we don't understand.

565
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,150
So we gave half a million dollars
washing university,

566
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:29,150
the form of a laboratory called the
Mcdonald Mcdonald Laboratory for

567
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:31,310
psychical research short,
we call it Mac lab,

568
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
a Peter Phillips there had an interest
in Paris psychology,

569
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,230
but really didn't want to get involved.

570
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,490
But the university said,
look,

571
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,410
we want this money.
We want this lab.

572
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,230
Um,
you believe in this kind of stuff.

573
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,790
You know,
you're interested in San and stuff and

574
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,590
he was a physicist so they put him in
charge.

575
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,360
Uh,
they had over 300 and some applicants

576
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,850
and out of all the,
I sent them a letter out of all the

577
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,850
applicants they had.
There was only two that were accepted.

578
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:57,320
I mean,
they did some research with other people

579
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,220
there too that they really accepted.
It was myself and another kid that I

580
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:03,410
didn't know at the time by the name of
Michael Edwards.

581
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,720
Um,
and uh,

582
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,730
Michael turned out to be a magician as
well.

583
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,030
And he had also spoke to randy,
so I get a call.

584
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,210
I said that there was an associated
press article that came out and that's

585
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,880
when I wrote to them and they said,
yeah,

586
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,380
we'd like to,
we'd like you to come visit.

587
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,840
I get a call from randy.
He says,

588
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:23,240
you know,
there's this guy at Washington

589
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,710
University,
he was being given half a million

590
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,350
dollars to study psychic phenomenon.
Like,

591
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,280
can you just think of his initials for
me?

592
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,290
I said,
is a p and a p?

593
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,101
He said,
how did you know?

594
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:32,270
I said,
I've already been accepted,

595
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:35,420
I was going to let you know,
and he started telling me about Mike,

596
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:38,330
that Mike had already been there.
Mike had been to key in their hands.

597
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:41,420
They were completely convinced that this
was real psychic phenomena,

598
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,300
but at that point Mike wasn't quite sure
where to take it.

599
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,330
And he knew randy was the expert at the
bunker in the field because randy had

600
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,340
the debunk geller and other psychic
phenomenon.

601
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,380
So he wrote,
he spoke with Randy on the phone and,

602
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:55,820
and I wrote to randy as well,
and they had some conversations and I

603
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:56,481
said to randy,
I said,

604
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:57,380
can I trust Mike?

605
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,750
He says,
I don't know enough about him to trust

606
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:02,390
him.
And Mike had the same concerns about me

607
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:04,040
because randy had mentioned me to him
and said,

608
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,530
you should mention,
you know what my real name is Stephen

609
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,930
Shaw.
So it's Steven Shaw back then check came

610
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:10,520
years later because people couldn't
remember.

611
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:13,870
Stephen Shaw think you remember a check
because of the.

612
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,650
I say,
here's the LTV.

613
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,250
So I,
I did a corporate gig one day and um,

614
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,400
which is good that you say that.
So I did a Gig one day,

615
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,560
uh,
it was a corporate gig and the guy got

616
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:27,050
up there and he's like,
either I was really insecure,

617
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,370
you know,
as we already talked about.

618
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:30,290
So I had my introduction,
here's my introduction.

619
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,420
And uh,
he says I want to do my own

620
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:33,280
introduction.
You know,

621
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,060
about you.
I've seen you do different things in

622
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,860
that.
So he gets up there and he says,

623
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,920
seen on the today show CNN live.

624
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,540
Um,
he's done this,

625
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,170
he's done that.
I've seen him do this and that.

626
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:45,810
Please welcome Steven.
What was the last name again?

627
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,873
Sorry.
Great.

628
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,270
So I get up,
I do my Gig,

629
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,870
I got another corporate gig that week.
I get up and say the last guy,

630
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,510
I forgot my name please.
You know,

631
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,800
remember,
my name is Stephen [inaudible].

632
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,451
Stephen Shaw.
Yeah,

633
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:56,284
I got it.
No problem.

634
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,630
He's done this.
He's done that.

635
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:59,150
He's on that.
Please welcome Steven.

636
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,440
What was the last name again?
Holy Crap.

637
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,980
It happened to me or third time.
And so I started thinking about why is

638
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:08,040
this happening and how can I fix this?
Well,

639
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,820
one way to fix it probably I think back
now,

640
00:27:09,821 --> 00:27:10,590
is just say,
hey,

641
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,900
read my thing.
Don't even memorize it,

642
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:16,620
just read it.
But Stephen is such a common name and

643
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:19,860
Shaw is such a common name.
There's really no real hard syllables.

644
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,930
And then except for maybe the team at
the va a little bit,

645
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,480
but not really.
It's a soft syllable so it kind of

646
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:27,570
passes right through the brain.
So they're thinking so much about

647
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,960
everything else they want to say,
you know,

648
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,070
cnn live the today,
show this and that.

649
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:34,110
I've seen in their story that they want
to tell them everything.

650
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,860
So by the time they get to my name,
they haven't really thought about my

651
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:42,570
name or memorize my name.
So I wanted a name that had at least two

652
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:45,660
hearts syllables,
something that would stick in the brain.

653
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:47,850
And I wanted a one word name,
not a two word name,

654
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,800
one word name,
like a rapper.

655
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,481
Yeah,
this is.

656
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:55,570
But this is before I'm dating myself.
This was a real wrap prepared.

657
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,740
That's it right there.
So C,

658
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,231
c,
e,

659
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:00,150
k right there,
and I loved that show.

660
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:04,550
He was at insurance,
a detective and was that show on?

661
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,450
I don't know.
I think it was only one season,

662
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,710
right?
If I'm not mistaken,

663
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:09,590
Jamie,
I don't know if you look that up on it,

664
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:11,190
but I think it was asleep.
Susan right here.

665
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,620
Season one
season.

666
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:16,410
That was a great show because he always
had these great Polish sayings that

667
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,510
meant absolutely nothing,
but it was just.

668
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,321
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

669
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:20,154
yeah,
yeah.

670
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,460
Very charismatic in that show.
But the,

671
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:24,840
the way he sold it was almost like a
magic trick.

672
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:27,510
It was like they put the statue on the
truck,

673
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:31,910
the truck arrives and it goes all the
way across the United States and no

674
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,210
statue.
Where did it go?

675
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,030
It turns out that what they actually put
on the truck,

676
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,330
they thought it was a statute because it
was covered and it was in this crate,

677
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,620
but it was a block of ice.

678
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,900
So by the time it got there,
it had already been switched out.

679
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,610
By the time it got there,
it had melted.

680
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:46,890
So it's sort of magic in its own way as
well.

681
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,040
So I,
it was sort of kindred spirits in a way

682
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,110
to that and I love the name band check
and I was like,

683
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:55,230
you know what,
if I use banner check the way it's spelt

684
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:57,440
there,
they going to say Ben Sec.

685
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,900
And so I put B,
a c,

686
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:01,561
h,
e k,

687
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:04,140
I didn't want to put an extra seat at
the end because then it becomes bounced

688
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:06,600
a check or something stupid like that.
So yeah,

689
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,650
I get banana check,
I get bonus check,

690
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,170
you know,
I get all these things but,

691
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:11,520
but at least here's the thing,
right?

692
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,720
So the old time is back then the ceos of
the company,

693
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,020
the presidents of the company,
if they remember the TV show,

694
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:22,590
they may make fun of me at first,
but they're going to remember the name

695
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,860
at the end of the show.
They now associate it with me because

696
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:28,410
I've blown their minds.
If they don't know it,

697
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:30,600
they've got to come up to me and say,
how do you pronounce that?

698
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:33,810
So they're thinking about my name.
Never had a problem since.

699
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,840
So there's the old TV show,
banner check,

700
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,480
but the way I spell it,
there was a grey hound a,

701
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:41,300
there was a dog,
uh,

702
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,190
there was a band called

703
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,650
a check and there was a construction
company.

704
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,970
Now the construction company owned the
bank check earl,

705
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,910
you know,
the website,

706
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,770
but they didn't do anything with it.
So.

707
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:53,980
And this is back before you could do
automatic payments,

708
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:56,530
like it just goes every year
automatically for you.

709
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,530
So I would sit there every year just
waiting on that all every day,

710
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,360
you know,
when I knew it was going to go up and I

711
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:03,850
finally got it.
Like I get after three years of it just

712
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:05,350
sitting there,
I finally was able to get it.

713
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,270
But yeah.
So anyway,

714
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,980
that's my name,
that's how I got my name.

715
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,770
Okay.
So go back to this Michael Edwards.

716
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,030
So Mike Edwards.
So

717
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,990
I go off on these weird.
I do this all the time.

718
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:23,110
I go off on so many different tangents
because it's so many different stories

719
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:24,340
and so many different directions I can
go.

720
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,660
So with Mike,
um,

721
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,690
and,
and you'll find that out in my life.

722
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,320
There is so much psychology applied to
everyday life for me,

723
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:34,150
like the name,
why did I choose my name?

724
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:36,880
There was a reason for it.
They say it's not just haphazard and

725
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:39,670
stuff like that,
or sometimes it's just a joke.

726
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:40,420
Like,
you know,

727
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,340
I get really sarcastic sense of humor.
Me here.

728
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,390
I go off on another tangent.
All right,

729
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:44,560
let's go back.
Um,

730
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,720
so here I am with a,
uh,

731
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,090
brandy telling me about them in it and I
said,

732
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:50,230
Yep,
I've already been accepted.

733
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,010
Mike and I are supposed to show up.
Um,

734
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,400
and by the way,
somebody recently bought my Barry

735
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,670
Sonnenfeld had bought my light life
rights with because of this whole thing,

736
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:03,100
which is called project Alpha that I'm
telling you the story about now.

737
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,850
And uh,
he had bought it and wanted a Aaron

738
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,650
Sorkin to write it,
but this is way back then.

739
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,400
No,
this is now like not so long.

740
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,210
A couple of years ago,
following up with your timeline,

741
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,950
I know Aaron was.
Aaron was.

742
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,870
Aaron was busy so he couldn't do it.
Uh,

743
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:21,100
and,
and then when he wasn't busy,

744
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,860
Barry got busy in my life.
Rights.

745
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,060
What they had were basically,
you know,

746
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,640
ran out,
so we've taken it now and I'm working

747
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:30,880
with another production company to do a
series on what we're talking about right

748
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:31,211
now.
So,

749
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:32,320
but anyway,
so here I am,

750
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,880
I'm with Mike Edwards.
We show up at the airport in St Louis.

751
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,470
First Time we get to meet,
we meet each other,

752
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,580
we hit it off right away.
I don't have my driver's license.

753
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,120
I had some form informed idea.
I don't want it for my id.

754
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,000
I had some of the former Id,
uh,

755
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:46,834
Mike,
uh,

756
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,240
he had his and he could drive.
He just got his at the time.

757
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,280
So I wonder if I use my password then.
I don't know.

758
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,210
Anyway,
this whole thing,

759
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,340
you do this,
this fast talking thing.

760
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:56,290
This is part of the shuck and jive
though.

761
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,420
This is a little bit of me but as I
understand,

762
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,910
but it also is very effective.
That's what a shuck and jive artist

763
00:32:02,911 --> 00:32:05,470
does.
They talk very fast and they never

764
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,380
pause,
so you never get a chance to interject

765
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,940
and they're constantly going.
So if they're reading euro or saying

766
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:15,430
something,
you have to keep up with them and part

767
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:19,000
of the keeping up with them as you get a
Little Bit Wilderness and bewildered,

768
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:23,950
you forget what you've said or they've
said and you're trying to sort of keep

769
00:32:23,951 --> 00:32:26,120
pace with them and you can.
And next thing you know,

770
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:26,861
they're like,
oh my God,

771
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,990
I can't believe you know that.
How'd you figure that out?

772
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,460
Well,
we'll get to that later and then you

773
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:33,610
keep going and you keep as part of the
entertainment aspect of it.

774
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,140
Yeah.
It's not what I'm doing right now

775
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:37,330
because they're sharp as when he was
fighting,

776
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,380
he would put a piece on you you couldn't
keep with,

777
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,790
right?
Yeah.

778
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,620
See,
you always analyze it with fighting,

779
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:45,470
which is great.
It's kind of that thing.

780
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,070
Vulnerabilities and exploit
vulnerabilities in the human mind.

781
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:51,050
They.
One of them is that you talk and think

782
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:54,110
faster than most people.
So most people when you're talking,

783
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,520
they don't have it.
Right.

784
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:58,880
You just did right there.
You want to get a chance to interject

785
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,510
because I'm gonna keep talking and as I
keep talking I talk quicker and you get

786
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,130
bewildered.
That's one of the things that you do to

787
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:05,390
people,
whether you realize it or not,

788
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,300
you do it because you've done it that
way for a long time.

789
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:11,480
It's probably become a pattern,
has become a pattern to make the other

790
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:14,600
person feel unsecure so you don't know
what you're paying for.

791
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,090
It's a patent for me being able to think
and not forget things as I'm saying them

792
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,070
like because like as you so effective
that you said that.

793
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,200
There is another thing that popped in
my.

794
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:27,080
I got like all day long.
I have songs in my head.

795
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,790
It doesn't stop.
Like I,

796
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,640
I do this with my teeth all the time.
Playing the music in my head like

797
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,690
constantly.
If I'm not thinking about anything else,

798
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:37,820
I have songs in my head constantly and
I've even.

799
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,470
I went to the dentist and I said,
Hey,

800
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,870
I've got this thing with my teeth and
I'm tapping my teeth.

801
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:43,640
I'm wearing him down.
You know what's going on?

802
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,050
And he says,
oh,

803
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,910
musicians do that all the time.
I go,

804
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:49,340
well,
I always have music 24 hours a day in my

805
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:50,250
head.
So wow.

806
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,620
But now I've gone off somewhere and they
would say,

807
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,483
oh,
the handwriting.

808
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,640
So if you look at my hand,
look my hand writing how bad my head,

809
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:57,650
right?
Like it's really hard to freaking read.

810
00:33:57,651 --> 00:33:59,120
Right?
But it's not that bad.

811
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,280
Somebody just wrote me a letter and I
read the letter.

812
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:03,890
Somebody,
a friend of mine sent me something.

813
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:05,630
He wrote me a letter and I've read his
letter.

814
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:07,310
I was like,
well what the fuck is that?

815
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,820
Because it's just scribbled.
Well that's me writing neat.

816
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,200
So slow.
So slow.

817
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:14,150
Normally when I write I can't read it
myself.

818
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,800
I.
Well that's the thing,

819
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:17,230
what you just said,
you,

820
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,413
you,
you,

821
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,210
you're trying to keep up with your
thoughts.

822
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,100
Yeah.
And that's one of the things about bad

823
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,870
handwriting.
They say that you're trying to keep up

824
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:27,830
with what you're thinking and learning.
It's always going a mile a minute.

825
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:31,730
It's a thousand different ways.
And I think it's part of my problem

826
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:34,640
solving is like when people give me
ideas that they want,

827
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:36,350
okay,
this is what I'd like to do as a magic

828
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,070
effect.

829
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,620
How do I do it?
I'm able to rattle off like 10,

830
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:43,700
15 different.
But it's like as a mentalist that way

831
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:46,190
that,
that pattern of talking is so

832
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:47,960
bewildering to people that they just
sort of like,

833
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:48,750
Huh,
what?

834
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,870
What?
Huh?

835
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,330
And you've got them on the ropes.
Always is that thing of even in my state

836
00:34:54,331 --> 00:34:56,490
show.
And you'll have to come to the state

837
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:57,324
show.
Something I would love.

838
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,170
I would love you to come see the mini
version of it.

839
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:02,030
When you did the television show,
I was blown away.

840
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,770
I mean,
the first thing I do is I come out

841
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,320
before I don't even introduce myself.
Where did you do it?

842
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:10,100
So if people can what they want to see.
I was just at Planet Hollywood filling

843
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,330
Vegas.
Yeah.

844
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:11,951
I've got a,
uh,

845
00:35:11,951 --> 00:35:13,280
a thing coming up,
uh,

846
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,040
at Rochester,
a fringe festival in Rochester,

847
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:16,680
New York.
I mean,

848
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,040
I'm at a lot of different college.
You can go to my website,

849
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,320
[inaudible] dot com and look up the
dates,

850
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:24,710
but the Rochester is going to be a on
the 13th at 7:00 PM.

851
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,820
40th 5:00 PM that I'm on the 20th at
9:00 PM,

852
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,050
2:23 PM.
I know.

853
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,230
So you can find it on the path.
You can't even help yourself.

854
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,290
You can find it on them.
You're going to find it on the website.

855
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,590
So it is on the website yet,

856
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,530
but you're in vegas all the time.
Right?

857
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm in Vegas a lot.
Work Vegas that much.

858
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,530
I'm busy now really until I'm beginning
of November.

859
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:48,180
I'm going to be like different places.
Just touring,

860
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,760
touring different places.
Some of it's corporate,

861
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:52,110
some of it's college,
you know,

862
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:54,000
it's a mixture of a mismatch of
different,

863
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,120
different things.
So go back to this whole James,

864
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,290
Randy,
Uri Geller.

865
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,160
So here I am with a Mike Edwards at the
airport and we're hitting it off and

866
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,860
everything.
Peter Phillips shows up and he's the

867
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:07,350
professor that I mentioned a minute ago
who's going to be doing the

868
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,120
investigating of us and he has this
wristband on and I'm always asking

869
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:12,901
questions.
What's this,

870
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:14,640
what's that?
And I'm always noticing things and he

871
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:18,930
said it was a wristband that he got from
a witch doctor in Africa that helps

872
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:21,630
protect him.
So I'm starting to think this might be a

873
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:24,060
little easier than I thought it was
going to be going in.

874
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,300
I was like,
I didn't know these guys skeptical.

875
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:28,800
They give you these one way.
Mirrors.

876
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,720
Are they gonna be trying to trick us,
catches.

877
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,680
I had no clue.
So we get into,

878
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:35,660
uh,
we were,

879
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,210
we had Peter Phillips,
his car because Mike was too young to

880
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:41,310
drive a rental.
Peter Phillips has at Rental Reynolds in

881
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:42,940
front of us who were following him.
And this is,

882
00:36:42,941 --> 00:36:44,490
this is how it all starts.
Really.

883
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,870
I'm sitting there and just kind like be
talking all the time.

884
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,400
I'm looking around,
I'm always doing something.

885
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:52,980
Always noticing something.
I look in the backseat and I noticed as

886
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:57,060
a briefcase I reached in the back and I
kind of pull it under the Dash.

887
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,910
It's locked into me.
Like if somebody locked something,

888
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:01,380
it means they don't want you inside
there.

889
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:01,981
Of course.
Right.

890
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:05,160
But why does anyone is in their old
briefcase easily.

891
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:06,090
You can just open the locks.

892
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,130
So I pick the locks,
open it up inside.

893
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:11,370
There's a whole bunch of silver.
So either this guy's a Kleptomaniac or

894
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,020
this is a civil right.
He's going to be using for the

895
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,640
experiments.
So I stopped bending it all up,

896
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,890
lock the briefcase,
put it in the back,

897
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,450
sit there for about two more minutes,
open up the glove compartment,

898
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,730
this extra keys and things in the glove
compartment.

899
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:27,030
I stopped bidding those up instead his
fucking keys.

900
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,770
I ha.
Well I'm a psychic,

901
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,100
right?
This stuff happens to those keys and

902
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,850
getting his house.
Yeah.

903
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,570
But I needed him to be convinced that
was genuine.

904
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,320
So I ended up looking over the car keys
that are hanging out,

905
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,700
the keys that are hanging out on the
car.

906
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:43,710
Key out of the ignition.
I start to reach over to get them.

907
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:46,170
And Mike just looks at me and says,
I think you've done enough.

908
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,280
Stop.
You know.

909
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,260
So.
But there's this really interesting

910
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:50,094
phenomenon,
right?

911
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,730
We knew that in the laboratory,
everything we did at that point was

912
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:56,550
going to be on a micro level.
It's going to be very small because it

913
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:59,820
had to be because we couldn't make it
look like it's a trick.

914
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:03,600
We had to look like my newt and not just
that.

915
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:05,560
We didn't know if they were going to be
watching it.

916
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,080
Like I said,
through one way mirrors and things like

917
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:09,210
that,
so this interesting phenomenon at the

918
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:13,230
time that was called spontaneous pk and
that is stuff that just happened.

919
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,340
Hey Pete psychokinesis PKA shorter for
the sector cases,

920
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,510
telekinesis,
psychokinesis,

921
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:19,590
the whole thing.
They all have the same thing,

922
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,690
so there's these things just supposedly
happened around these psychics that can

923
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:27,770
bend metal stuff,
moves,

924
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:31,890
stuff breaks that.
So those things were the things that

925
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:34,470
would convince him and keep him holding
on.

926
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,570
Even if we did a big band out of the
laboratory but not on camera.

927
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,720
That's the thing that would keep him
going.

928
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,810
I want to get that on film.
I definitely want to get that on film.

929
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:46,420
I'm going to document that someday.
That's going to happen in the

930
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:49,360
laboratory.
When we ended up getting to the

931
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,850
laboratory,
all the students at the university were

932
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,460
extremely skeptical,
very,

933
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:55,660
very skeptical,
but they had heard about the spontaneous

934
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:58,720
pk,
so they hit things under neath,

935
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,540
the video recorders in it.
There was a separate room and they hit

936
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:05,440
all kinds of things everywhere around.
I noticed there was stuff hidden.

937
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:06,490
I mean,
why is it recorded?

938
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,020
Had none of that VCR,
you know,

939
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:10,180
why is there a fork hidden behind that
cupboard,

940
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,650
you know,
it doesn't belong there.

941
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,540
So I started bending up all those things
on lunchtime and that convinced all the

942
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:19,330
students that we were genuine as well.

943
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,293
So this,
this,

944
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:21,941
this,
this,

945
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:25,120
this whole thing went on and on.
It's a simple as.

946
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:30,450
So what happened was immediately randy
sent them a list of 13 caveats things

947
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,010
that we,
that they shouldn't do,

948
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,230
and it was common sense stuff,
right?

949
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:38,380
It was stuff like,
don't let the subjects work at the same

950
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:41,770
time because they could distract you.
Don't let them work with more than one

951
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,070
object at a time because they could
confuse you with those objects as to

952
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:48,070
which ones you bending and there was
this whole list of different things.

953
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,180
They showed the list to me and Mike and
had a good laugh about it and said,

954
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,100
this would make you guys so
uncomfortable.

955
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:58,240
We want you to be comfortable where in
reality they should have followed that

956
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:02,240
list because one of the things randy
said was mark everything on a micro

957
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:07,260
micro and a macro level so they the
subjects can see the macromark but won't

958
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:09,670
realize as a micro mark on there as
well,

959
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,010
which would have helped because their
idea of doing a macro mark was on every

960
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:15,430
fork.

961
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,910
They took the fork or spoon.
They measured it at both ends,

962
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:22,300
like the height from the table and they
measured the middle of the four from the

963
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:25,240
height from the table.
Then they put a label on it on a little

964
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:30,241
string with a number on it and that was
her idea of keeping track of if

965
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:32,920
something had bent on.
Not because they would measure it after

966
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:37,090
we concentrated on it and they would
then remeasure it again afterwards and

967
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:37,721
they would say,
oh,

968
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:38,860
okay,
this is a.

969
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,660
This has been a millimeter or two
millimeters.

970
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,540
So we would do things like,
we would say,

971
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,220
this tags in my way.
Can I take it off?

972
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,541
Yeah,
you can take it off.

973
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,250
We put it down,
concentrate on it,

974
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,560
didn't do anything.
Put it down on the table,

975
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,230
pick up another fork or spoon.
Say,

976
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,460
do you mind if I remove this tag?

977
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,750
Take it off,
put it down,

978
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,430
concentrate on it.
Nothing happens.

979
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,870
Switched the tags around on the one that
was on the first one to the second one,

980
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:05,650
the second one of the first one,
and then put the two folks off to the

981
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:07,810
side and then wait two,
three hours later,

982
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,380
pick up one of those forks.
Obviously not doing anything with it.

983
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,790
Concentrating on it.
Say,

984
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,160
why don't you measure it,
and they would measure it and the

985
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:18,610
measurements had now changed not
realizing because they never measured

986
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:21,730
the other one again because I remembered
everything consistently later on and put

987
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:22,990
new tires on them.
Every single time,

988
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:27,700
not realizing that we just simply
switched forks or as we reached across

989
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:29,740
the table,
we would lean on one of the forks and

990
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:33,100
then ours again later we would pretend
like we actually bought that for.

991
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,430
So this went on.

992
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,880
I mean it went on for 180 hours over
four years.

993
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:39,290
I mean,
we messed with these people bad.

994
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:42,260
We did probably some things at the time
that were probably illegal as well,

995
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,120
like leaving the window unlocked at the
laboratory,

996
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:50,060
going off to the club across the state
line,

997
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,550
coming back like about four or 5:00 in
the morning,

998
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:56,840
break it into the building and bending
up every single piece of metal that was

999
00:41:56,841 --> 00:42:00,860
in the laboratory.
They had a fucking scientists.

1000
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:02,360
We're running this.
Well,

1001
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,560
this is back in the eighties.
So.

1002
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:04,171
Right.
And they,

1003
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:06,140
they had,
they actually had this aquarian back in

1004
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:08,530
the 80 scientists were like eighties TV
shows.

1005
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,110
No,
it's true.

1006
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,260
And here's the sad thing,
right?

1007
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,550
I went into this thinking these people
were going to be the enemy.

1008
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,960
It was me against them.
You know,

1009
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:21,290
I had to do this.
Turns out these are just really,

1010
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,410
really nice,
nice people that are very naive when it

1011
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:27,200
comes to what psychic phenomena as well.

1012
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,830
If you're a scientist,
most likely you're not studying a whole

1013
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:35,831
lot of liars and mentalist magicians and
psychic phenomenon and you really are

1014
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:39,770
probably trying to find out whether or
not it's real and maybe you believe a

1015
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:43,130
little bit too much.
You don't know enough yet when it came

1016
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:45,140
to this type of phenomena.
Absolutely.

1017
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:48,410
But you gala was already doing that.
Other psychics are already doing it in

1018
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:52,160
other countries and they will be
invalidated as a genuine thing in other

1019
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:52,994
countries.
Yeah.

1020
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,540
We brought over in France,
Steven North over in England,

1021
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,310
you know,
there was a lot of research going on in

1022
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:00,560
England at the time on this type of
phenomena as well.

1023
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:04,550
It was a really big thing back then.
It was just people hosing people.

1024
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,520
It was a little kid.
So here's a weird thing,

1025
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:09,950
right?
So over in England there were,

1026
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,540
um,
I can't think of what the guy's name is

1027
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:12,330
now.

1028
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,170
Uh,
there was a scientist over there,

1029
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:16,100
a pair of psychologist who was working
with little kids,

1030
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:19,190
and his thinking is that kids don't lie.
Little kids don't lie.

1031
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,410
That's all they do is lie.
They get to that point where they

1032
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:23,190
learned how to lie to get anything and
everything.

1033
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,340
Kids don't lie.
That's someone without kids.

1034
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:28,640
And these kids only got caught.
The only reason they got caught,

1035
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:32,180
which by accident because they were the
video cameras are left on and soon as

1036
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,030
the Paris psychologist left the room,
the kids were taking forks and spoons

1037
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:38,690
and actually bending them underneath
their feet and then putting them back up

1038
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:39,590
on the,
on the table.

1039
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,270
So then they would come in.
It was literally scientists went in with

1040
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:47,480
the premise that children don't lie.
That is one of the dumbest fucking thing

1041
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,670
I've ever heard in my life.
Don't disagree with you,

1042
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,910
but this is how badly people wanted to
believe in this phenomenon.

1043
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,480
Why do people want to believe in hidden
powers?

1044
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,210
I think it's white.
People want to believe in most things,

1045
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:00,044
right?
I mean,

1046
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,120
we want to find,
we want to believe there's something

1047
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:04,550
more than just us,
like for most people we're just,

1048
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:09,380
we're not enough and I don't know if
it's because we get so bored with our

1049
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,130
lives,
we get depressed without lies,

1050
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:11,800
we get,
you know,

1051
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,150
we're in this everyday thing of going to
work,

1052
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,160
coming home.
And is this all there is,

1053
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,730
is this,
that,

1054
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,650
you know,
is there something else that,

1055
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,350
that's a super power that I could,
I could actually have.

1056
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:24,650
Is there something I can discover that's
bigger than me?

1057
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,700
Better than me,
you know,

1058
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,060
does this a units versus much bigger
than just this planet right here.

1059
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:29,900
Right.
So,

1060
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,830
I mean if you asked me,
I think that

1061
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,300
if you,
if a Ufo is,

1062
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,070
we'll come in here.
If they were coming here,

1063
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:36,090
let's say,
I don't believe they were,

1064
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,280
but if they were coming here you don't
believe they were.

1065
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,340
But I think if they,
I just don't,

1066
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,233
I,
I don't.

1067
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,060
I think we would really have real
evidence.

1068
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:46,590
One hundred percent evidence of it by
now.

1069
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:47,760
But here's the thing,
right?

1070
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,670
Wouldn't it make much sense?
Even like for us?

1071
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:52,650
Okay,
let's say we start going looking at

1072
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:54,720
other planets,
are we going to send other humans out

1073
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:59,310
there or are we going to go ahead and
send robots or something like that?

1074
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,830
They can last much.
Yeah,

1075
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,480
like in the last month and robots are
getting better and better and better.

1076
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:06,120
So if there's an advanced civilization,
civilization,

1077
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,470
surely they would also have this
advancement where they don't have to

1078
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:12,870
send themselves out.
They can send something to represent

1079
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:13,020
them.

1080
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,610
Right.
What the real hardcore believers believe

1081
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:18,810
those grades are gray aliens.
The big black eyes.

1082
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:22,470
They think there's some sort of a
android or something and it could be,

1083
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:24,630
but I don't believe.
I don't believe we had him.

1084
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:29,070
I believed a lot more before I started
doing that television show.

1085
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,850
The television show cured me of bigfoot,
cured me of psychics,

1086
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:36,210
cured me of aliens,
cured me of almost everything.

1087
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,200
Well,
this is a thing with me,

1088
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,250
right?
When I was a young kid,

1089
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:39,480
I believe in that stuff.
You know,

1090
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:41,430
when I was a young kid,
I spoke in tongues.

1091
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,040
I thought they did.
Yeah.

1092
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,460
Yeah.
I had the whole experience.

1093
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:45,294
I mean,
it was like,

1094
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,890
you know,
all the chemicals running through my

1095
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:50,640
body and me just
doing the whole damn thing,

1096
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:51,391
you know,
and go into that.

1097
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:56,391
And I realized later what was going on
at the time I was looking for answers.

1098
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,430
I was looking for answers.
So you mentioned that a very disturbed

1099
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:02,550
life and you're probably looking for
some sort of security.

1100
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,980
I got shut down every single time I
would ask the questions.

1101
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:06,640
I was called a troublemaker,
you know,

1102
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,760
oh,
we're talking about darkness and evil.

1103
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,350
Oh,
well how come the Bible's covered in

1104
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,510
black to shut up?
Don't ask questions.

1105
00:46:12,511 --> 00:46:13,350
You know,
I've written black.

1106
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:13,791
What do you mean?
Well,

1107
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:15,360
you know,
the cover of most of the bibles back

1108
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,960
then we didn't have the white bibles.
We all had the black bibles and it was

1109
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:20,790
just,
I would just ask innocent questions

1110
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:21,601
like,
okay,

1111
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:22,190
well how can I,
if,

1112
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,600
if you're talking about darkness being,
you know,

1113
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:25,690
an evil and you're,
you know,

1114
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,740
it's all associated.
Why is this Bible covered in black?

1115
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:30,340
You know,
and I just wanted answers,

1116
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,390
was looking for answers.
I would ask these questions and I do

1117
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:33,570
that.

1118
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,980
I,
I thirst knowledge,

1119
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:36,330
I love knowledge,
you know,

1120
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:39,390
I read all the time.
It's just I'm always looking to try to

1121
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:41,730
understand things.
I won't always retain all that

1122
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:44,130
information,
but it'll be in the back of my head

1123
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:47,100
somewhere where it will pop out at some
point when I do need it.

1124
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:49,110
So.
But it is fascinating.

1125
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,320
This desire to believe,
especially the desire to believe things

1126
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:56,420
that don't necessarily make sense.
Whether it's ghosts or it's Ufos or do

1127
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:57,960
you ever watch that show?
Finding bigfoot?

1128
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,940
I have in the past.
It's not something I sit down and binge

1129
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,560
it,
but every episode is like a rock got

1130
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:09,561
thrown or this same as these gaucher
like that every week nothing happens,

1131
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:12,510
but somehow they managed to keep you
glued to your seat.

1132
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,760
I think you watch it.
People watch it because they think,

1133
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,960
oh,
this is going to be the show.

1134
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,090
This is going to be the one because they
tease it like that.

1135
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:18,980
But here's the thing,
right?

1136
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,590
If it was the one we would have already
heard about it before it got to air.

1137
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,870
The key is night vision.
Once you have night vision,

1138
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:28,530
you seem legit.
He looking for things in the basement.

1139
00:47:28,531 --> 00:47:31,690
Are you looking for things in the woods?
If you have night vision or thermal

1140
00:47:31,691 --> 00:47:32,860
visions,
like something.

1141
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:33,760
Oh,
technology.

1142
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:36,280
They'll find it now where it's like the
ghost detecting meters,

1143
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:38,740
so it's a little meetings.
You can set them off just by hitting a

1144
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:40,060
walkie talkie.
Oh,

1145
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:40,781
you can?
Oh yeah.

1146
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:42,800
Like way across the room or in another
room.

1147
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,340
You had a walkie talkie.
Those things go freaking crazy.

1148
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:48,230
You know,
in the in paranormal research.

1149
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:50,800
Is there like a moment?
Where.

1150
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,360
Do you know that in Seti?
Search for extraterrestrial

1151
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:56,830
intelligence.
There's A.

1152
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,080
There's this one phenomena that
happened.

1153
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,600
I think they call it the blip or
something like that.

1154
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,400
Yeah,
I don't think that's the name.

1155
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,950
I think it was either.
There's this one

1156
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,560
or whatever it is.
There's one loud noise that came from

1157
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:13,930
space that they think is.
They don't know what it is.

1158
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,740
They're not sure what that was,
so you know what?

1159
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,270
I'm conflating it with something that
happened under water.

1160
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,490
That's what I'm doing.
There was something.

1161
00:48:21,491 --> 00:48:24,790
There was an organic noise that was
underwater.

1162
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,070
It wasn't the signal that's the cold,
the bloop,

1163
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,900
whatever it was.
There's a steady thing like that.

1164
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,820
There is a steady thing like that too,
but I'm.

1165
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,520
I,
I confused the two events that there was

1166
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:37,270
something that happened where they
recorded an organic sound underwater

1167
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:39,670
from some sort of an animal that they
don't know what it was,

1168
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,980
but they think it could be a whale or
something.

1169
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,560
Who knows?
Just something could be something you

1170
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,810
discovered you hadn't seen yet.
I mean,

1171
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:49,120
it's a lot of stuff under there we don't
know about for sure.

1172
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,440
Big Place.
Yeah.

1173
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,380
When we're talking about the desire for
people,

1174
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,080
I mean this is what one of the reasons
why being a mentalist works or being one

1175
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:02,920
of these psychic hoaxers works is
because people have this overwhelming

1176
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:06,700
desire to believe there's something more
out there and not just the powers that

1177
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:10,750
you and I possess the normal sense of
seeing and hearing and touching and

1178
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:12,700
smelling and d,
but there's more.

1179
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,860
Some people have more,
some people knowing the phone's going to

1180
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:16,180
ring.
Some people know things.

1181
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:18,610
They have an intuition.
They could sense rs.

1182
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,650
Some people.
No,

1183
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:20,500
hold on,
hold my hand.

1184
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:22,720
Let me look in your eyes.
I know things.

1185
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,190
I know.
Things you don't know.

1186
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,890
It's like the creepy how you're looking
at me right now.

1187
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,610
Just weird.
That's a weird thing,

1188
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:30,130
right?
But that's what the desire because it

1189
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:32,350
gives us a white.
Why would somebody be looking at me like

1190
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:35,380
that if there wasn't a purpose and if
you believe in if there wasn't something

1191
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,670
when I perform,
I don't just read minds.

1192
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,860
I,
I do things like I touch their hand,

1193
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:43,630
I seen him look at me,
see this right there,

1194
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:48,250
and I do certain things because it's
that thing of like I've got to show a

1195
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:52,300
process and if I'm showing a process,
why would I be showing a process if it

1196
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:54,670
wasn't real?
Now here's the weird thing was so

1197
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:56,500
overwhelming them with things to think
about.

1198
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,970
Yeah,
to a point.

1199
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,300
I know we you touching them and moving
them or looking at them as all these

1200
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:05,380
variables they have to take into account
and they're on their map of things that

1201
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:07,960
they're processing.
That's now some new territory.

1202
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,300
Yeah,
it,

1203
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:10,540
it,
it also.

1204
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,550
We talked about this earlier.
We got to come.

1205
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,930
We've got so many stories all over the
place.

1206
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,850
We stopped at that.
I'll try to come back to some of them,

1207
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:20,851
but it's back in my comedy club days.
I worked the worst and the best clubs.

1208
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:23,410
I mean that was at the comedy workshop
in Houston,

1209
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:24,690
Texas.
I don't know if you remember them on.

1210
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,510
Sure.
Paul Solos,

1211
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:27,980
Sharon,
and they

1212
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,560
had me come and do a Christmas show
because I wanted a clean show for

1213
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:32,990
Christmas and I came in and then they're
like,

1214
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:34,220
all right,
you're going to go out in the road and

1215
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:35,810
you're headlining.
Like straight off headlining.

1216
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,980
No middling,
no,

1217
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:38,240
no opening act,
nothing.

1218
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:41,180
I went straight into headline in which a
lot of comedians hated me for that

1219
00:50:41,181 --> 00:50:44,270
because they're working so hard to get
and it's like there's no place for magic

1220
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:45,680
in a comedy club.
It's a comedy club,

1221
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,350
but I was going out.
I was doing these comedy clubs,

1222
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:50,930
but I was doing like the best and I was
also doing the worst,

1223
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:55,470
like I always doing comedy clubs where
literally it's a kick a bar in a,

1224
00:50:55,471 --> 00:50:58,940
uh,
an oil town and there's Mesh like in

1225
00:50:58,941 --> 00:50:59,721
blue brothers,
you know,

1226
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:02,990
across the front because people throw
beer bottles at the band and everything

1227
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:06,200
else and I'm performing behind that with
a little gate that they have to come in

1228
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,950
for me to perform with these people with
a big pole in the middle because people

1229
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:12,710
kick her dance around that and the bar
is actually around the corner and I got

1230
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:13,630
to try and get people in that.

1231
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:18,350
So I performed at the worst and the best
places I performed in situations where

1232
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:20,870
people were just not there to see the
performer there.

1233
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:23,270
You know,
at colleges where it's a,

1234
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,330
a day show and day,
a mandate shows are the worst in

1235
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:27,920
colleges.
The worst if you've done them.

1236
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,150
Yeah.
Like you come in,

1237
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,250
it's like they're sitting in the
cafeteria.

1238
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,460
You are performing the cafeteria,
they're trying to study for a test.

1239
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,430
They're not there for you.
So I got to grab their attention.

1240
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,650
So my first thing is to come out and
say,

1241
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,480
if I was to ask everyone to think of a
playing card,

1242
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,280
you might think ace of spades,
queen of hearts,

1243
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,780
I want everyone to think of a car.
I'd get one,

1244
00:51:44,781 --> 00:51:45,441
get one,
get one,

1245
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:46,700
get one,
stand up.

1246
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,900
And it's like Bam,
Bam,

1247
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:48,350
Bam,
Bam,

1248
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:48,711
Bam,
Bam,

1249
00:51:48,711 --> 00:51:49,041
Bam,
Bam,

1250
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:49,820
Bam.
It where it's like,

1251
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,730
holy crap,
we need to pay attention to the sky.

1252
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,850
And so that's where I came in from those
harsh days.

1253
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,490
Really just trying to grab their
attention with comedians.

1254
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,960
Do Bar gigs.
Yeah,

1255
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:02,420
you just got to,
you got to quiet them down.

1256
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:05,000
You got to go to grab him.
So anyway,

1257
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:06,530
so I'm with the scientists.
Uh,

1258
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:08,420
we break in,
in the laboratory at night.

1259
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,060
Uh,
they have an aquarium,

1260
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:15,710
there's another psychic there that
supposedly gets ghosts to come in and

1261
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,230
the ghost will write things in these
coffee grounds,

1262
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:21,890
in this inverted aquarium,
a with a padlock on it.

1263
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:24,340
And there's bars that go over it.
My Kid,

1264
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:28,490
the other kid that's with it looks
underneath and realizes that the,

1265
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,840
even though it's locked on top,
the post that it's locked to those nuts

1266
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:34,100
underneath it,
like bolts,

1267
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,720
he just unbolted it,
lifts it up.

1268
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:39,650
We write stuff in the coffee grounds,
we bolt it back up and you know,

1269
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:41,480
so it's like all these things and we
bend everything.

1270
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,210
Uh,
we go to bed about five in the morning

1271
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,390
and uh,
Peter Phillips calls and he calls it

1272
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:48,830
about seven in the morning.
He says,

1273
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:49,430
how you doing?
I said,

1274
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,750
oh,
I didn't sleep well last night.

1275
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,760
I had a dream that we were in the
laboratory,

1276
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:54,830
you know,
trying to work and everything just bent

1277
00:52:54,831 --> 00:52:56,840
and went crazy.
He said,

1278
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:57,630
well,
go back to sleep.

1279
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,040
I'll talk to you in a few hours.
He calls me back in about another hour.

1280
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:00,741
He says,
you did it,

1281
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:01,551
you did it.
You did it.

1282
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:02,750
And I go,
what did we do?

1283
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,280
He goes,
you know,

1284
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:05,750
he says,
your psychic powers when you were

1285
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:08,090
sleeping,
bent everything in the laboratory.

1286
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,950
So it was just,
we play these games.

1287
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:12,350
We did these live.
He's still alive.

1288
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:14,900
I've met him since then,
feel tricked him.

1289
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,860
He felt,
well,

1290
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,000
here's the thing,
I felt bad.

1291
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,020
So we were talking to randy at one point
because,

1292
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:25,890
um,
we did a conference and there's a kid by

1293
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:27,540
the name of muscle,
walkie Chiodo.

1294
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:28,510
Alright.
Uh,

1295
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,260
from Japan,
Masa walkie could speak English.

1296
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:34,090
She had a band that he was in as well.
Um,

1297
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,920
so we sang English songs and everything
and I'm rooming with him and I say to

1298
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:39,960
muscle walkie Kyoto because he's playing
it up for real,

1299
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:40,740
like,
you know,

1300
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,930
and I say,
is there anytime when you can't do your

1301
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,310
psychic powers,
you use a trick.

1302
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:44,940
And he says,
oh,

1303
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,860
can't speak English,
cannot speak English.

1304
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,390
All of a sudden he couldn't speak
English.

1305
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,120
So with this gallows at the thing as
well.

1306
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,980
Um,
and the reason I mentioned muscle walk

1307
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,870
is because there was a TV producer from
England that came over and he said to

1308
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:58,351
randy,
said,

1309
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:00,690
randy,
what would convince you that this stuff

1310
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:01,910
is genuine?
Rainy,

1311
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,830
gave him the same 11 caveats that he
gave to the scientist,

1312
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,380
the same 11 carrots.
And uh,

1313
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,490
the guy followed them.

1314
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,620
He sat with me.
He sat with Mike,

1315
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,290
he sat with muscle walkie up the muscle
walk.

1316
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,070
He had a way for twisting a spoon and
basically had a thing in his shoe.

1317
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:18,660
He would go down and when nobody was
looking,

1318
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:21,990
put it in there,
but because this guy followed the 11

1319
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:24,390
caveats,
nothing happened that day.

1320
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,860
Absolutely nothing happened until the
cameras went off.

1321
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,000
The moment the cameras went off,
muscle walkie twist that a spoon and

1322
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:37,470
started getting it to twist.
The producer had a complete mental

1323
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:38,160
breakdown.
Now,

1324
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,150
to this point,
I'm just thinking,

1325
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,050
this is tricks,
right?

1326
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:42,060
It's not.
It's not that big of a deal.

1327
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,860
He starts screaming,
yelling that randy's evil should never

1328
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:48,930
have listened to randy.
He would've got this on tape if it

1329
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:53,280
wasn't for Randy and he looks down and
he's got a wet spot on the front of his

1330
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:57,300
pants and he looks down and he says,
I just had a demonic ejaculation,

1331
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,060
like literally,
and he's having his mental breakdown.

1332
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,470
I go and I have to spend the night,
which was not a bad thing.

1333
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:08,670
She was quite pleasant to look at his
his assistant.

1334
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,300
I had to spend the night with her in her
room because randy was calling her.

1335
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,320
I'm not randy.
I mean,

1336
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:14,300
uh,
uh,

1337
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,360
Tony editable calling of the producer
was calling her consistently screaming

1338
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,220
and yelling about randy and this scared
them.

1339
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,430
Hold the fuck up.
You can't just gloss over the fact that

1340
00:55:23,431 --> 00:55:25,590
guy just noted in his pants and he was
yelling,

1341
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,050
you just had a mental.
It's a mental breakdown,

1342
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,440
orgasm and your pants during a mental
breakdown.

1343
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,780
I didn't do it.
He did it that you should document that.

1344
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:35,430
That's more present than bending a
spoon.

1345
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,420
I should've said,
yeah,

1346
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,400
that's my psychic ability working right
there.

1347
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,320
I mean,
that doesn't make any sense.

1348
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,020
So he tells you this as an ejaculation.
His pants.

1349
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:47,000
He in front of everybody.
He says it's a demonic ejaculation.

1350
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,230
East.
Straight up says I added the Arctic

1351
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,800
ejaculations.
Seems like a together guy with

1352
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,600
definitely got a head on his shoulders.
Was a producer for us.

1353
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,610
I think it was BBC,
if I'm not mistaken.

1354
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:58,370
He was doing a documentary for them,
so yeah.

1355
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,610
Well,
he's fucking crazy.

1356
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:01,340
Huh?
He finished.

1357
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,760
He finished a documentary,
so.

1358
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:03,720
Oh,
well yeah,

1359
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,010
definitely.
It wasn't crazy then.

1360
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,610
As long as you finish this documentary.
Well,

1361
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:11,160
he believed in psychic phenomena.
He believed that the demon made them

1362
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:12,450
come in his pants.
That is true,

1363
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,000
yes.
As show it to you as to whether he

1364
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:16,980
believed it was a demon or not.
I don't know.

1365
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,670
Demons.
Demonic.

1366
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:19,770
Ejaculate.
When your parents,

1367
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:20,990
what do you like?
Pull your shirt down.

1368
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,640
Like get out of there.
I think I wouldn't dating that demon.

1369
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:29,220
I mean probably the price to pay that.
You wouldn't want that.

1370
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,090
Don't need a girlfriend.
Donate a woman at that point.

1371
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,810
Grants when disagreement and yellow.
It's a good looking demon.

1372
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:39,990
So he was saying that randy was evil
because if it wasn't for Randy's rules

1373
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,760
that he would not.
He would have got this on tape.

1374
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,820
But how dumb does that guy have to be?
I mean that is so silly.

1375
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:49,900
Like this is a person that's supposed to
be discovering or at least investigating

1376
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:53,860
psychic phenomena and he doesn't
understand that investigator,

1377
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:54,940
right?
He's a producer.

1378
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,950
He's a producer who believes in this
phenomena.

1379
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,460
Hence he wants to do a documentary on
psychic phenomena.

1380
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,300
Has an interest in it.
He already believes in it,

1381
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,370
so he's not,
he's not as bad as the,

1382
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:08,020
the Paris psychologists who are supposed
to be using proper science because I'm

1383
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:10,600
often asked,
is it right?

1384
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,750
Is it ethical that you full scientists
in the name of science?

1385
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:15,880
Right?
So this becomes this whole big question

1386
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:16,220
like,
uh,

1387
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,120
we will be unethical to do that.
Um,

1388
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,450
and my aunts that did that in a minute,
who the fuck asked you that question?

1389
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,260
A lot of scientists say that fools.
Well,

1390
00:57:25,261 --> 00:57:26,030
and it's a thing,
right?

1391
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:28,600
Because if you think that they do,
it's like,

1392
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,170
yeah,
if you ask a guy who's a thief to break

1393
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:35,680
into your house and then he breaks into
your house in a method that with a

1394
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,830
method that you didn't anticipate,
is that unethical?

1395
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,840
It's no different than what you're
doing.

1396
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:42,100
You're,
you're a mentalist.

1397
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:44,230
You're,
you're a person who is trying to trick

1398
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:46,330
them.
They have all these rules setup to make

1399
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:49,180
sure that you don't trick them.
So they know for a fact that what you're

1400
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:52,000
doing is psychic energy.
But if you don't really have psychic

1401
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:55,270
powers and you absolutely don't,
of course you're going to fucking trick

1402
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,520
them.
The idea that you would trick them and

1403
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:59,380
that would somehow or another be
unethical.

1404
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,000
No,
you just played the game better than

1405
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:01,451
them.
Well,

1406
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:02,500
this was,
this was the point,

1407
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:03,700
right?
It was this thing of like,

1408
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,660
uh,
my thing was,

1409
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:08,830
should you be taking money to
investigate this phenomena under false

1410
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:12,460
pretenses because you're not using
proper science if you're using proper

1411
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:14,500
science.
I won't get away with any of this.

1412
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:17,860
Had you have followed brandy's rules,
we would not have got away with any of

1413
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:18,040
this.

1414
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,200
I mean,
we had very strict ethical rules.

1415
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:21,880
If you ask us,
if we magicians,

1416
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:24,430
we have to say yes.
If you ask us if we're working for the

1417
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:27,430
amazing randy with him,
you have to say yes.

1418
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,350
You know,
so we have all these rules.

1419
00:58:29,351 --> 00:58:32,920
Those old TV shows where like if someone
was an undercover cop and say,

1420
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:35,110
are you a cop?
They have to tell you that they don't

1421
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,300
really have to do that,
that that's they don't know.

1422
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,500
That's the only premise they use really
shows a damn it.

1423
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,950
Have you asked a cop,
are you a cop?

1424
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,270
And they go,
no,

1425
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:46,060
and then you buy the heroin off him.
Them still go to jail.

1426
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,490
Wow.
Yeah,

1427
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,710
I remember that.
I'm going to go buy heroin or anything,

1428
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:52,060
but you know there may be something
else.

1429
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,290
I'll say something about a gun.
Yeah.

1430
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,130
There's very few people that have told
me a story where I go,

1431
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:58,750
damn,
I wish I was there for that story,

1432
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,960
but the nuts and the pants and blaming a
demon,

1433
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,380
I really do wish I was there.
I really wish I was there for that guy.

1434
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,660
I like to be in the room and I'd be
like,

1435
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:09,610
hold up.
Everything else.

1436
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:11,540
Just going to get put on the back burner
here.

1437
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,820
Nowadays it'd be like,
hold on,

1438
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:16,030
let me get my smartphone out.
I got to take a picture on instagram.

1439
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:19,000
Demon and why are you showing me?
You're just so parents.

1440
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,890
How much do you have to come?
And your pants were chosen.

1441
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:21,980
The

1442
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,260
outside,
Jesus Christ.

1443
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,770
We was scared though.
Like kids like we will,

1444
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,810
we will kill you.
So probably towards the end 19 would've

1445
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:35,360
been about 1981.
Nineteen 82.

1446
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:36,710
That means I'm 21,
22,

1447
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:38,480
somewhere in that area.
You could probably still kick

1448
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,470
[inaudible] ass.
Yeah.

1449
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:44,471
But keep in mind I was also a kid who
was very like socially and like not.

1450
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,650
I mean I'm the kid in the back of the
class when the heavy coat on in the

1451
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,790
middle of winter.
Was that the first time a guy that ever

1452
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,900
came in his pants and then pointed to it
in front of me as well?

1453
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:54,550
For me?
Yes.

1454
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:58,340
That's never happened my whole life.
I can never say I've ever had that

1455
00:59:58,341 --> 00:59:59,770
happen.
Know ever.

1456
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:02,870
I like to go to my grave without anybody
ever nothing in their parents.

1457
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,660
And then pointing down,
go look at Damon made me do this.

1458
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,360
Or you have an excuse now if it ever
happens to you.

1459
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:13,220
Well now the problem is millions of
people have heard this and so they'll

1460
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:17,030
just scan me.
So I'm going to run into people.

1461
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,270
Everywhere you go,
you guys are going to pull their shirt.

1462
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,620
He goes to work at a comedy comedy.
Be 10 guys,

1463
01:00:22,621 --> 01:00:24,890
stand up with a puddle pointing down
with a little bit.

1464
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,210
It's going to be great day.
Maybe not in my pants.

1465
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,210
Did you bring nails?
Man?

1466
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,350
I did.
I brought Nelson.

1467
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:31,880
I got.
I got some stuff.

1468
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:33,260
Maybe we might get to some of that
stuff.

1469
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:35,030
I have it.
I have stuff here in case.

1470
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:39,950
So you felt bad that you trick this
dummy with Mike and I really like.

1471
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:42,380
We were scared because we realized the
kind of.

1472
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,160
He was unhinged.
Not that we realized the kind of power

1473
01:00:46,161 --> 01:00:49,500
we had over these people at that point
it was just them,

1474
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,850
but it's like there's another whole
thing going.

1475
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,350
This whole psychological thing going on
here because they want to believe so

1476
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,560
badly.
Really messing with people's heads,

1477
01:00:57,561 --> 01:00:59,210
right?
I mean we're really.

1478
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:02,090
And what's going to happen?
We come out and say this is all a fraud

1479
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,110
and fake.
So we sat down random.

1480
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:03,944
He said,
look,

1481
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,680
we want to come out and we want to end
it now.

1482
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,700
And he was like,
you know what?

1483
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:09,620
We got a TV show.
We're going to be coming up in a couple

1484
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:11,660
of months.
Let's just wait and expose it then.

1485
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:13,450
It's not gonna make any difference.
So we,

1486
01:01:13,451 --> 01:01:15,110
we hung out until that time.
I mean,

1487
01:01:15,111 --> 01:01:16,620
there was a peripheral,
you know,

1488
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,760
scientists and there was one guy with
any of that birth or swartz.

1489
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,300
I didn't want to do anything with him
because he kind of came into the scene

1490
01:01:23,301 --> 01:01:26,720
at the end of working with the Mac lab,
but he kept pushing and pushing and

1491
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:28,670
pushing and he lived in New Jersey.

1492
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:34,010
So finally I went out there and this guy
kind of believed in everything it was.

1493
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,110
It was.
He wrote a whole book called the,

1494
01:01:36,111 --> 01:01:37,010
uh,
tanning,

1495
01:01:37,011 --> 01:01:40,590
the poltergeists of the poultry taming
Tammy.

1496
01:01:40,591 --> 01:01:42,500
I mean,
the guys you can find it online as well.

1497
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:47,060
And it was a booklet and it was a,
it was for the psychosis psychosis

1498
01:01:47,061 --> 01:01:47,980
dynamic,
uh,

1499
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,500
something like as a,
something of dentistry and medicine,

1500
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:55,610
but it was an actual medical journal and
it was all about his stuff that he had

1501
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,320
done with me.
Um,

1502
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,760
but this guy believed in everything.
Like,

1503
01:01:58,761 --> 01:02:00,970
he handed me a camera one time,
uh,

1504
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,320
uh,
a video camera and he said,

1505
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:03,840
look,
I've,

1506
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,441
uh,
I,

1507
01:02:04,441 --> 01:02:09,441
I knew a lady that could take pictures
of the sky and when I get the film and

1508
01:02:10,131 --> 01:02:12,800
you know,
I get it developed and I look at it and

1509
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:15,350
I play it,
you can see Ufo is in the sky that you

1510
01:02:15,351 --> 01:02:16,730
couldn't see with the naked eye.

1511
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,080
Can you do that?
Now?

1512
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:19,590
I was one of these kids that I was just
like,

1513
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,270
I would say I could do anything and
everything.

1514
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,610
Even in the laboratory I would say I
could do anything.

1515
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,830
And um,
so he hands me the camera.

1516
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:30,390
I start taking pictures of the parking
lot in the sky and everything and I hand

1517
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:32,640
it back to him.
So he gets it developed when he gets

1518
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:34,830
developed.
This is vacation footage and then

1519
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:39,831
there's him handing me the camera.
You see all of a sudden this weird kind

1520
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:43,770
of blog.
And in the blob you see a woman's torso

1521
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:46,140
and thigh.
You see a woman giving birth to a baby.

1522
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:51,141
You see Jesus Christ,
you see all these images and he,

1523
01:02:51,441 --> 01:02:51,960
uh,
he,

1524
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,640
he,
he,

1525
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,990
he pointed them out to me.
I could see them as well when you

1526
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:57,790
actually pointed Aurora Shark test,
that kind of thing.

1527
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:58,680
Sort of.
Yes,

1528
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:00,590
because this guy's affording
psychologists.

1529
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,490
All right,
so we'll,

1530
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:05,340
all I had simply done was I,
I didn't know what to do.

1531
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,170
I was just making stuff up as I went
along.

1532
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:12,000
So I spat on the front of the camera and
that Blob as it changes and as it dried,

1533
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,730
almost like looking at clouds,
you could see all these different

1534
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:18,540
shapes.
And so he believed that this was psychic

1535
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,340
phenomena.
This was something that was happening.

1536
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,460
Now I got to give the Mac lab credit
because when Peter Phillips said,

1537
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,330
saw it,
he said,

1538
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,340
yeah,
it looks like a blob of water and,

1539
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:28,040
and,
but,

1540
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,670
but,
but birth always said to him,

1541
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:30,660
he said,
yeah,

1542
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:32,910
but it's what's in the blog that's
important.

1543
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:35,010
It's what you see inside that's
important.

1544
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:37,290
He called me up one day.
I lived in Pennsylvania.

1545
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:38,970
Then he called me up one day and said,
you did it.

1546
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:39,960
You did it.
And I said,

1547
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,210
what did I do?
He said,

1548
01:03:42,211 --> 01:03:43,140
well,
there's this jar,

1549
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:46,080
and there was this one jar that he would
have silverware and things inside,

1550
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:50,310
and they were all sealed and he would
have sitting up on a shelf and it's 7:00

1551
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:52,560
every night I was supposed to
concentrate and never did,

1552
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:55,960
but I was supposed to concentrate from
Pennsylvania and get the try to get the

1553
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:59,400
stuff to ben long distance.
And he calls me up.

1554
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,280
He said,
you know that Joe,

1555
01:04:00,281 --> 01:04:01,530
you concentrate every night.
Yep,

1556
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:03,210
I know that you are.
He said,

1557
01:04:03,211 --> 01:04:04,170
you did it.
And I'm thinking,

1558
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:04,880
damn,
I'm good.

1559
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,970
Oh,
what the hell happened here?

1560
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:06,481
He says,
well,

1561
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:08,730
you actually missed it,
but you hit the radiator and it's

1562
01:04:08,731 --> 01:04:13,620
leaking all over the floor.
So he believed that's how much this guy

1563
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:15,450
believed in all this stuff and gave me
credit.

1564
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:17,760
But when you read it,
here's the interesting thing,

1565
01:04:17,761 --> 01:04:18,421
right?
You know what I mean?

1566
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:22,020
He stuck electrodes on my head.
He did all kinds of psychological tests

1567
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:25,470
and the psychological tests turned out
that if I wasn't psychic,

1568
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:28,590
I would be crazy.
So those tests,

1569
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,540
his,
his psychological tests for me show that

1570
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,970
if I wasn't like psychic I would be
crazy,

1571
01:04:32,971 --> 01:04:35,130
but I was asking and answering the
questions like a psychic,

1572
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:38,270
like a psychic wooden.
So Berthold Schwartz was a,

1573
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:41,910
another character and at the very end
when we came out and said this was all a

1574
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,110
fraud,
it was all a fake.

1575
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,040
Berthold was the one that said amongst a
couple of other people,

1576
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,510
but he was the primary one that said,
look,

1577
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,840
they say they were lying,
then how do we know they're not lying

1578
01:04:51,841 --> 01:04:53,470
now?
Oh good.

1579
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,320
Which is an interesting question,
right?

1580
01:04:55,321 --> 01:04:58,080
But my answer,
because I can show you how I did those

1581
01:04:58,081 --> 01:04:58,914
things.

1582
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:01,260
Even the Mac lab,
they,

1583
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:04,530
we had a conference in the time life
building in New York where we came

1584
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:06,180
clean.
He said it was all a hoax we got up

1585
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:08,460
there and if you can ever find footage
of this online,

1586
01:05:08,461 --> 01:05:12,540
it's great because randy introduces us
and it's time life building.

1587
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:13,830
Everybody's there.
I mean,

1588
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:15,420
you know,
discover magazine,

1589
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:17,440
psychology today.
Uh,

1590
01:05:17,441 --> 01:05:18,520
you know,
the New York Times,

1591
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,380
everybody,
everybody from all over the world there.

1592
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,340
And they think Randy's found two
psychics that are genuine and we get up

1593
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:26,620
there and we demonstrate stuff.
And then Randy's,

1594
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:28,150
you know,
somebody asks the question,

1595
01:05:28,151 --> 01:05:29,020
you know,
how do you do it?

1596
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,820
And Randy looks at us,
he says,

1597
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:33,160
you want to answer Mike?
So Mike Edwards walks over,

1598
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:34,003
he says,
Yep.

1599
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:37,300
He said,
it's a hoax,

1600
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:38,560
it's a trick.
And then I say,

1601
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:39,970
yeah,
for the last four years we've been

1602
01:05:39,971 --> 01:05:42,710
fooling the scientists and that's when
we came out and you see that mouse open.

1603
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:43,960
I like,
oh my God,

1604
01:05:43,961 --> 01:05:44,760
you know,
it's,

1605
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,610
it's just,
it's great.

1606
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:47,770
Great footage when you could see it
because it's that moment,

1607
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:52,720
the scientists would not answer that
phone until we spoke to them.

1608
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:56,980
And I have the recording,
I have jay had the recording of where I

1609
01:05:56,981 --> 01:06:01,981
ended up calling them back and I'm
recording the conversation and I,

1610
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,810
he says,
we've heard this rumor that you guys are

1611
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:07,240
working with Randy and that you're not
real.

1612
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,740
And I say,
what do you think?

1613
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,310
And he says to me,
that can't be true.

1614
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,320
It has to be real.
And I go,

1615
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:16,030
well,
unfortunately it is true.

1616
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:18,520
And he starts asking,
well,

1617
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:21,190
how did you do this?
And then I tell him how did you do that?

1618
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:24,880
And I tell him and he's constantly
asking about this and that,

1619
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:28,660
trying to find one thing,
one thing that he could hold onto.

1620
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,290
And there was some little things because
a lot of times when you have real

1621
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,900
information and you know you're going to
be to do something,

1622
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:37,480
you take chances and sometimes those
chances hit as well.

1623
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,510
So you can't explain that.
That's just the odds,

1624
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,220
right?
Yeah.

1625
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:48,300
So he wanted desperately to believe.
And the thought was that maybe you had

1626
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:52,300
psychic powers but you didn't want
people to know you at psyche power so

1627
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:55,180
that you trick them.
And then you were lying afterwards to

1628
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:57,170
conceal your power.
Right.

1629
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:02,060
He also mentioned that Randy May have
paid us off to life for him too.

1630
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,570
So yeah.
Well he was probably devastated,

1631
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:05,860
right?
Because as a scientist,

1632
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:06,701
I'm sure he was.
He,

1633
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:09,400
he caught a guy that I knew in
Washington,

1634
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:11,830
Pennsylvania where I lived,
and I think the guys still lives there

1635
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:13,440
now,
but it had been the name of Joe newsome

1636
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,410
and Joe was an escape artist and I knew
Joe now,

1637
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:20,350
keep in mind when I was doing all this,
I really didn't know any magicians.

1638
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:21,880
In fact,
even when I started out,

1639
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:24,820
I didn't know there was an area of magic
call mentalism,

1640
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:25,760
which is doing,
you know,

1641
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:28,260
taking your five senses to create the
illusion of a sixth sense.

1642
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:31,090
You not a psychic,
you're using tricks using psychology,

1643
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:32,380
verbal,
nonverbal communication,

1644
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,560
but mostly magic to create these tricks.
All right.

1645
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:35,950
I knew,
I didn't know that.

1646
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,760
I just knew there were people that con
people with tricks to make them think

1647
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:41,980
they were psychic.
That's all that I knew at that time.

1648
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:45,580
But I met a few magicians and one of
them was Joe newsome.

1649
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,650
So birth Schwartz caught up,
Joe.

1650
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:48,580
He said,
why would,

1651
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,800
why would steve do this?
Why would I do this?

1652
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,690
Um,
and Joe says,

1653
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,760
I don't know,
but I could open the locks with my mind.

1654
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,890
Joe Proceeded,
which I thought was a really asshole

1655
01:07:59,891 --> 01:08:02,530
thing to do.
Joe Proceeded to work with him for years

1656
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:05,560
until birth old,
died and birth will believe that Joe has

1657
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:07,240
psychic powers and I called Joe up one
time.

1658
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:08,170
I said,
why you doing this?

1659
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:09,400
This guy has been through enough.
You know,

1660
01:08:09,401 --> 01:08:11,620
we've already expose it as a fraud,
as a fake,

1661
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:13,450
you know,
why are you doing this to that guy?

1662
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,280
And rather than answer the question,
he pretended

1663
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,710
that he was his brother that had
answered the phone,

1664
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:22,700
but I know Joe and I knew Joe and I knew
it was his brother doesn't sound

1665
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:25,790
anything like him.
So isn't it possible that some people

1666
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:26,390
like,
look,

1667
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,810
some people like playing tennis.
Some people like fucking with people,

1668
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,570
right?
He likes fucking with people that sport

1669
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,610
probably.
Yeah.

1670
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:37,550
He probably gets a hold of a mouse,
doesn't kill it,

1671
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:41,990
so let's it crawl away a little bit.
Then swats it and brings it back and

1672
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,160
that's it.
Survive.

1673
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:45,740
I mean that's probably what he was
doing.

1674
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,210
Well sometimes a mouse likes that,
right?

1675
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:50,150
No,
I don't think the mouse over like I was

1676
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:51,070
talking to my friend.
No,

1677
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,370
I was talking to my friend tires.
Right.

1678
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:55,940
So there's this thing of this enzyme
that cats have.

1679
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:59,060
I can't think of what it talks to a
plasma enzyme.

1680
01:08:59,061 --> 01:08:59,800
It's a parasite.

1681
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,020
Parasites.
Then that goes into some nice where they

1682
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:06,130
think it's okay to have fun to play with
a cat or a more complicated than that,

1683
01:09:06,131 --> 01:09:11,131
but it actually turns their sexual
reward system sideways where the cat is

1684
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,360
the.
When the cat urinates the smell of cat

1685
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:17,120
urine,
gets them excited and actually makes the

1686
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:21,750
mouse aroused and it removes all fear
of,

1687
01:09:21,751 --> 01:09:23,180
uh,
of the cat cat.

1688
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,850
Yeah.
Because the only way that toxoplasmosis

1689
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:29,650
gone d,
which is the parasite can reproduce,

1690
01:09:29,651 --> 01:09:34,651
is inside the cat's gut.
So the cat has to eat the mouse or the

1691
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:38,360
rat in order for this parasite to
reproduce.

1692
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:42,530
And then the reproduction.
The thing is it doesn't affect the cat's

1693
01:09:42,531 --> 01:09:43,940
behavior,
which is very strange,

1694
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,400
but it does affect people.
It does affect people.

1695
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:48,340
And it does affect rats and mice.
Yeah.

1696
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,960
Do you think that's why we have cat
ladies?

1697
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,000
Oh yeah.
You think it affects those crazy

1698
01:09:53,001 --> 01:09:53,880
bitches,
you think?

1699
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,090
You said it doesn't affect,
it doesn't affect people,

1700
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,760
but do you think it does affect?
It doesn't affect.

1701
01:09:58,761 --> 01:09:59,690
Cat's got.
Gotcha.

1702
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,750
The cat's behavior seems to be the same,
exactly the same,

1703
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:06,350
but it definitely affects people.
It makes people more impulsive.

1704
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:11,630
There's a bunch of weird correlations.
There's a recent study that showed that

1705
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:15,350
entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial
behavior is often connected with

1706
01:10:15,351 --> 01:10:17,460
toxoplasmosis infection.
Wow.

1707
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:21,800
People are more risk.
They're more inclined to take risks and

1708
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,270
take chances.
It's also,

1709
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:26,300
there's a disproportionate number of
motorcycle victims,

1710
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:29,960
uh,
of crashes that have toxoplasmosis

1711
01:10:29,961 --> 01:10:30,920
infection.
Really?

1712
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,480
Yeah.
This came from Robert Sapolsky,

1713
01:10:32,481 --> 01:10:34,220
his work.
He's a professor at Stanford.

1714
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:37,040
We had a chance to interview him.
Fascinating guy.

1715
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:37,923
Yeah.
Well,

1716
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,840
a lot of his,
uh,

1717
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:43,090
his work he's done on toxoplasmosis.
You think there's other,

1718
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,950
a lot of other things like that that we
don't realize that affect human

1719
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:46,580
behavior?

1720
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,900
There could very well be.
I mean,

1721
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:50,620
there's a bunch of different parasites
that people get and you know,

1722
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,940
there was another guy,
God,

1723
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:57,890
what's his name?
Hortense out of University of Houston.

1724
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:01,940
Peter Hotez dammit.
Anyway,

1725
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:06,950
he's an infectious disease expert who
specializes in same television show that

1726
01:11:07,581 --> 01:11:12,581
I worked with you and he said that
people that live in jungle,

1727
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:19,460
literally 100 percent percent of them,
100 percent are infected with parasites

1728
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:22,380
while various parasites,
some documented,

1729
01:11:22,381 --> 01:11:23,560
some undocumented.
Yeah,

1730
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:24,690
yeah,
yeah.

1731
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:27,420
And many of them control behavior.
Yeah.

1732
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:29,520
It's fascinating.
There's some of them that are really

1733
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:30,370
creepy,
like there's one,

1734
01:11:30,371 --> 01:11:34,290
there's an aquatic worm that talks at
grasshopper and drowning so that it can

1735
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,890
give birth,
so it literally gets into the

1736
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:41,370
grasshoppers brain rewires it's brain,
tells the grasshopper to jump into the

1737
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:44,340
water so it can come out of its body and
exist in the water.

1738
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,060
It's amazing when you think about that,
right?

1739
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:50,880
How those things have developed to be
able to do exactly specifically what

1740
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,740
they,
certain things need them to do.

1741
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,930
So that's something else can benefit
from it.

1742
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:57,060
Is that what his name is?
Because I wanted to get a benefit.

1743
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:59,440
What?
Trying to find it out.

1744
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,580
I couldn't cut down it that way.
I think it's Peter Hotez.

1745
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,740
Ortez Shit.
Sorry.

1746
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,790
University of Houston.
Um,

1747
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:11,280
I can find it pretty sure.
Pretty sure anyway,

1748
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,430
so yeah,
I mean your friend probably just like

1749
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:17,250
fucking with people and you'd probably
feel like this guy's a dummy.

1750
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,930
I'm just gonna.
Keep fucking with these dummies.

1751
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,300
Have you ever do it?
Because I wanted to.

1752
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,180
Oh,
I know you did that.

1753
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:26,780
I thought I was doing the right thing
and I didn't realize that these people

1754
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:29,010
are going to become my friends.
I'm eating with them every day.

1755
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,510
They've got these lives,
you know,

1756
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:34,620
and I care about people and at some
point I know that I'm going to have to

1757
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:37,470
come out and it's going to be
devastating for them.

1758
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:38,560
You know,
he did it for years,

1759
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,760
got tenure at the university.
He's going to look like an idiot at the

1760
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,940
end of this and that wasn't my purpose
of doing it much bigger picture.

1761
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:46,890
Yes,
I get it,

1762
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,350
but that is what he is.
No,

1763
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:49,890
no,
I agree.

1764
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:51,540
And that's what I'm saying.
There's a much bigger picture.

1765
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:56,190
I would do the same thing again.
I would just protect myself emotionally,

1766
01:12:56,191 --> 01:13:00,210
I think more than I did then.
So you went to become friends with.

1767
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:04,410
I would not become close friends with.
I wouldn't share a lot of my life with

1768
01:13:04,411 --> 01:13:06,060
them.
I wouldn't want to learn about their

1769
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:09,130
life.
I'd want to keep it much more maybe than

1770
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:11,910
you dragged it on for so long,
you know?

1771
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,950
Maybe if you just did it over a couple
of days,

1772
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:15,910
no way to do that.
I mean,

1773
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,210
we would have days where we would do
nothing.

1774
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:21,720
Like we literally sat in the lab and
nothing would happen for an entire.

1775
01:13:21,721 --> 01:13:23,270
That's fucking commitment,
man.

1776
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:25,700
Do that shit over four years.
Well,

1777
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:26,543
here's the thing,
right?

1778
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:28,740
It's,
it's a bit misleading because it's 180

1779
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:32,930
hours total and what that means is we'll
coming out on holidays were coming out

1780
01:13:32,931 --> 01:13:37,300
on weekends would coming out on that.
You're extending this project for a long

1781
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,510
time and we weren't making money at it.
You know,

1782
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:41,400
there was a podium that paid for our
food,

1783
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,610
but that's about it.
Yeah.

1784
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:43,840
You were just doing it for the
procedure.

1785
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:45,810
I lost money because I had to take time
off work.

1786
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,410
Yeah.
It's,

1787
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:50,310
I think it's what you did as a good
thing.

1788
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,610
Yeah.
Document because you show that even

1789
01:13:53,611 --> 01:13:57,150
scientists can be tricked if they're not
really following the scientific method

1790
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,960
and that was the way to do it because
there were even some psychologist who

1791
01:14:00,961 --> 01:14:01,620
said,
look,

1792
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,780
if you think you can infiltrate a
laboratory,

1793
01:14:03,781 --> 01:14:04,470
go ahead and do it.

1794
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:08,640
So we were doing things in accordance
with what some of the psychological as a

1795
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:12,070
psychologist we actually saying we
should do for sure.

1796
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:16,780
Like that's the whole game.
The game is you're supposed to be.

1797
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,900
They're supposed to try to find out if
you're tricking them.

1798
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:21,760
So they should be assuming you're
tricking them.

1799
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,130
Yep.
So they're not assuming you're tricking

1800
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:25,720
them,
they're tricking themselves and that is

1801
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:28,630
part of the problem with psychics.
Like I had a friend of mine went to a

1802
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,040
psychic and they're like,
oh my God.

1803
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:31,270
He knew all about my grandma.
I go,

1804
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:33,430
don't you know about your grandma?
I go,

1805
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:35,860
if this motherfucker really knows
psychic,

1806
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,070
he really knows his psychic power.
They're going to tell you some shit you

1807
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:41,110
don't know.
Telling you things about your life.

1808
01:14:41,111 --> 01:14:43,750
You already know I don't need anybody to
tell me about my life.

1809
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,340
Now that's a good thing,
right?

1810
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,580
That's all they're doing and there's
ways to get that info from you without

1811
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:50,770
you realizing what I was saying this to
my friend,

1812
01:14:50,771 --> 01:14:54,940
he did not want to listen to me.
He wanted to believe so strong and he

1813
01:14:54,941 --> 01:14:56,740
definitely didn't want to believe they
got tricked.

1814
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,750
This is part of the problem with
scammers.

1815
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:00,490
Have you ever seen some of those
scammers,

1816
01:15:00,491 --> 01:15:02,770
those Nigerian scammers,
and get these poor,

1817
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,220
lonely Melina to think that women are
waiting for them in Europe?

1818
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,920
There was a terrible television show.
I mean terrible in that.

1819
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:14,130
It was so sad.
This one guy flew to Europe twice to be

1820
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:18,430
with this woman and every time he flew
there she had something come up and meet

1821
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,960
him.
It was devastating.

1822
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:24,250
She couldn't meet him and he.
He kept going back and his daughter was

1823
01:15:24,251 --> 01:15:27,250
saying,
I can't convince him that this is a

1824
01:15:27,251 --> 01:15:27,970
scam.

1825
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:29,860
He really believes this woman's waiting
for him.

1826
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:33,880
He's never heard this woman's voice.
She says she can't talk on the phone,

1827
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:34,630
but she,
he,

1828
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,820
she sends pictures and he really
believes strongly.

1829
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:39,180
You know,
it's,

1830
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,990
it's really sad.
I,

1831
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:44,280
I,
that's why I find like in like Penn,

1832
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:48,760
Penn Jillette gave me one of the biggest
compliments that I've ever had actually

1833
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:50,400
at one point,
um,

1834
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:52,660
he had seen me work and his wife had
seen me work.

1835
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:55,150
Emily had seen me work and emily came
and she said,

1836
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:58,780
yeah,
Penn said that if we didn't know you

1837
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:02,650
were not psychic from that demonstration
from watching a show,

1838
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:05,200
you were the most convincing psychic
we've ever seen.

1839
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:06,063
Well,
I said to,

1840
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:08,080
yeah.
So the same thing to Duncan when you did

1841
01:16:08,081 --> 01:16:09,970
that performance for us on television.
I'm like,

1842
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:13,780
that is the craziest shit if you weren't
so adamant that what you were doing was

1843
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:14,614
a trick.
Right.

1844
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:15,610
And Doug was like,
dude,

1845
01:16:15,611 --> 01:16:19,430
what if he's fucking with man?
He really is.

1846
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:23,620
Dunkin tends to,
um,

1847
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:24,770
you know,
he,

1848
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:29,240
he has a thirst for the fantastic.
Yeah.

1849
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,280
So for him,
which is nice that you can play off of

1850
01:16:32,281 --> 01:16:32,710
that,
that it's,

1851
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:34,020
it's a good thing to have.
Uh,

1852
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:34,990
yeah.
I,

1853
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:35,500
um,
my,

1854
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,720
my house,
it showed for that exact reason,

1855
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:42,790
the show I'm doing in Rochester,
it's called telepathy and the first half

1856
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,370
usually it's gonna be,
I don't actually have to hats,

1857
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:47,290
but normally I do.
Normally it's a two hour show,

1858
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:51,670
but I've had to cut it down to an hour
show and the first half was always me

1859
01:16:51,671 --> 01:16:54,490
coming out talking about telepathy.
What is telepathy?

1860
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:56,710
What did Einstein,
he believed it was radio waves.

1861
01:16:56,711 --> 01:17:00,600
Marie Curie believed that it was,
telepathy was a real way that he even

1862
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,170
wrote the foreword to a book called
telepathy.

1863
01:17:02,171 --> 01:17:02,801
So yeah,
yeah,

1864
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:05,020
he believed it was a real thing.
He believed your mind give out radio

1865
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:08,710
waves that other people actually picked
up a Sigmund Freud believed it was

1866
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:09,950
related,
a dream state,

1867
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:11,240
you know,
there was all these different third

1868
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:11,540
theories.

1869
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,860
I mean,
the word was coined in,

1870
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:15,530
I think it was 18,
42 by uh,

1871
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:19,400
Frederick Myers and he believes certain
things about telepathy.

1872
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,290
So there was all these different things.
Um,

1873
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:23,180
uh,
I start off a Conan doyle who wrote

1874
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,050
Sherlock Holmes,
you know,

1875
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:28,460
most rational character in literature.
He believed that with spirits all around

1876
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:29,690
us,
it could pluck a thought out of one

1877
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:31,250
person's mind and actually put it in
another.

1878
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:34,170
So he believed all prognostication.
All these things have to do this,

1879
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:36,470
had to do with spiritualism.
So there's all these people.

1880
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:37,500
I mean the US government,
you know,

1881
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:41,000
about Star Gate,
they gave $20,000,000 in the seventies

1882
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:45,170
going on into the nineties to study and
find out if this stuff had any practical

1883
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:48,020
military applications on these type of
things.

1884
01:17:48,021 --> 01:17:49,570
So remote viewing,
tell it.

1885
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,260
Yeah,
well that's where remote viewing came

1886
01:17:51,261 --> 01:17:52,290
out.
The other thing,

1887
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,360
stargate not cured me of that television
show did try to do that.

1888
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,460
You did that.
I think you actually did that with the,

1889
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,160
with Dj growthy on there as well,
so.

1890
01:18:01,161 --> 01:18:01,870
Yeah,
yeah,

1891
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:03,080
yeah.
I think he was part of that,

1892
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:07,280
but of that Dj,
me and Dj both did better.

1893
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:10,970
Just faking it then.
That's great.

1894
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,970
We just made a bunch of shit up and drew
some stick figures.

1895
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,840
That's how that can be the tower.
This is the tower is about.

1896
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,800
Actually it was a man,
but it looks like a tower.

1897
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:21,590
Right?
There was the one guy that's famous for

1898
01:18:21,591 --> 01:18:23,720
remote viewing.
I interviewed him as well.

1899
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,070
What is his name?
Yeah,

1900
01:18:25,071 --> 01:18:27,080
you say his name.
I'll know it.

1901
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,490
I'm not bell all the time.
They'll be on there for hours and hours

1902
01:18:31,491 --> 01:18:34,520
and hours and met him and I was like,
is this guy fucking with me?

1903
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:36,260
Yeah.
And he was explaining how he worked for

1904
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:39,530
the US government,
how they found Osama bin Ladin fucking

1905
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:44,880
bonkers somewhere else that,
that doesn't work.

1906
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:46,320
Fun Guy.
Yeah.

1907
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,070
Was telling me about his hot Russian
girlfriend.

1908
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:48,913
I was like,
all right,

1909
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,610
tell me more about that.
Let's go that direction.

1910
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:55,280
Can I remote viewer?
I think you put it in my head right now.

1911
01:18:55,281 --> 01:18:56,061
Can I see which.
Oh,

1912
01:18:56,061 --> 01:19:01,061
she's in the bathtub to be more having a
demon ejaculation.

1913
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:05,300
And
so anyway,

1914
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:08,870
since that time I've,
I've gone after many different things.

1915
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:10,220
Um,
Peter Popoff,

1916
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:12,290
the evangelist said he was getting the
word of God.

1917
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:15,260
Randy came to Houston in 1986.
The earpiece in?

1918
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:16,520
Yeah,
I found the earpiece.

1919
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:17,960
Oh,
you found that it was me.

1920
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,840
Yeah.
So Randy was writing an article,

1921
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:23,950
I think it was Hustler magazine.
It was one of those magazines on

1922
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,320
evangelists,
evangelists.

1923
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,930
It was a good place to hide something.
It was one of the things.

1924
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:32,140
It may not have been hustled,
so I don't want you to quote me on that.

1925
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:34,770
That house did a lot of those and that's
what I'm saying.

1926
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:36,870
I didn't Penthouse,
but I don't think it plays a lot.

1927
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,650
I think it was hustling,
but I could be wrong is one of the ones

1928
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:42,650
that people actually read because the
girls never take their panties off.

1929
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:45,530
So you get bored with just looking at
now though it didn't.

1930
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:48,140
They go back to.
Well they don't know they were.

1931
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,470
They went to looking after.
They did not do it at all.

1932
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:52,720
Yeah,
yeah,

1933
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,090
yeah.
Show amazing willpower.

1934
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:58,610
Sorry.
They went to the key needs or underwear.

1935
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:03,330
They stopped taking their clothes off.
But then sales inexplicably tank.

1936
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:05,600
It's so strange.
Those articles,

1937
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,160
they did have good articles in playboy,

1938
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,060
had interviews.
They had a lot of groundbreaking on

1939
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:14,040
through the years.
Buddy of mine had a book of all the

1940
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:16,410
different playboy interviews.
Over the years,

1941
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:16,941
and I was like,
well,

1942
01:20:16,941 --> 01:20:18,510
I have some good stuff.
Yeah,

1943
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,340
so randy.
Yeah,

1944
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,200
Randy for Hustler.
Yeah.

1945
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:23,910
Writing for us though on evangelist.
He said,

1946
01:20:23,911 --> 01:20:25,320
Hey,
do you want to come see this evangelists

1947
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:25,890
with me?
I'm like,

1948
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:26,380
yeah,
sure,

1949
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:30,120
I'll come.
So went there and it was about 10,000

1950
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:30,780
people.
It's downtown,

1951
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:31,750
Big Auditorium,
Houston,

1952
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:32,880
huge auditorium.
You know,

1953
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:37,560
all these people sitting around and a
pop off comes out on stage.

1954
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,900
He starts saying he's getting the word
of God.

1955
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:43,040
He's telling people their names,
information,

1956
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,970
who their doctors are,
what their ailments are,

1957
01:20:44,971 --> 01:20:46,140
and he's.
He starts healing.

1958
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:49,560
People have cancer.
He starts healing people of blindness.

1959
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,960
People walking again,
and it was really,

1960
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:53,670
really emotionally for me.
I tears in my eyes,

1961
01:20:53,671 --> 01:20:57,270
but I knew that was all bullshit,
but I had to news bullshit and crying.

1962
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:01,650
It can you get this whole fucking life.
Like when you see a little kid crying

1963
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:03,240
and running down the aisle,
you know,

1964
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:05,490
you,
you want to get angry,

1965
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:07,980
but at the same time it's like,
it's just so emotional.

1966
01:21:07,981 --> 01:21:10,020
It's just the.
You get caught up in this whole thing.

1967
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:13,680
It's just new,
so he asked for people to collect money.

1968
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,750
He's just asking random people,
come up,

1969
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,130
grab a bucket,
go collect money.

1970
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,230
I got down there.
I remember I was like the 15th bucket.

1971
01:21:19,231 --> 01:21:21,360
I got my bucket.
I walk around,

1972
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:22,680
I get checks.
I got probably about,

1973
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:24,090
I don't know how much.
10 grand,

1974
01:21:24,091 --> 01:21:24,830
20 grand.
I don't know.

1975
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:26,130
You know what I've got?
I mean money.

1976
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,000
First of all,
getting money.

1977
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:28,750
Then you've got to.
I'm think I'm done.

1978
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:29,250
He said,
nope.

1979
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:29,761
Yeah,
okay.

1980
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:32,910
Once you got to go back out and collect
checks and now we're going out getting

1981
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:35,310
checks in the bucket and then it's like
go out,

1982
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,040
get sealed offerings and people are
dropping envelopes in there with like

1983
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:40,050
watches,
rings and stuff like that.

1984
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,470
As I come back,
I hand the bucket up to pop off and I

1985
01:21:43,471 --> 01:21:46,590
look up and I noticed that he's got a
piece of plastic in his ear.

1986
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,860
I go back to randy and I say,
Randy,

1987
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:50,370
I said,
look,

1988
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:53,700
either this man of God,
God doesn't like him enough to heal him

1989
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,760
and he's got a hearing aid or something
else is going on.

1990
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:58,920
I don't know what,
but something else is going on and I

1991
01:21:58,921 --> 01:22:00,450
think that's how he's getting
information.

1992
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,321
And Randy was like,
no,

1993
01:22:01,321 --> 01:22:03,840
he's using mnemonics.
Mnemonics that basically memory systems.

1994
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:04,920
All right.
I,

1995
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:06,840
you,
I have to use a lot of mnemonics to

1996
01:22:06,841 --> 01:22:11,550
memorize things because otherwise I have
major issues and I know a lot about

1997
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:13,740
mnemonics.
You either memorize a lot of bad things

1998
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:16,980
about a few things.
Oh you memorize a few things about a lot

1999
01:22:16,981 --> 01:22:19,080
of things,
but you don't memorize a lot of things

2000
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:20,490
about a lot of things.

2001
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:23,010
And he was memorizing a lot of things
about a lot of things.

2002
01:22:23,011 --> 01:22:23,890
If that was the case,
I said,

2003
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:27,510
I don't think so.
So they went out to the next pet,

2004
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,570
pop off a congregation thing when she
was in San Francisco,

2005
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,990
got a friend of ours from a Alec,
Jason,

2006
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:35,110
I think his name is,
uh,

2007
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:39,870
from a WHO's an electronics engineer and
that was everything about electronics.

2008
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:43,800
And he brought this little scanner and
dressed up as a security guard hanging

2009
01:22:43,801 --> 01:22:45,720
out in the back.
And he was scared to death he was going

2010
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:47,250
to get called.
Nobody questioned him.

2011
01:22:47,251 --> 01:22:51,030
He's there in a security outfit and he
scans all the frequencies ahead of time

2012
01:22:51,031 --> 01:22:54,570
and he blocks out every one of those
frequencies that are known frequencies.

2013
01:22:55,320 --> 01:23:00,320
The moment pop off hits the stage,
a brand new frequency pops up and turns

2014
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:05,070
out,
I think it was a 37 point.

2015
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,840
I can tell you in just a second here.
It was A.

2016
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:08,480
Yeah.
Wait,

2017
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,290
was that the frequency that he was on
was?

2018
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,250
Yep.
I thought it was right.

2019
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:13,990
Yeah.
30 nine point seven megahertz.

2020
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:17,490
That's what God broadcasts on and it
sounds an awful lot like Peter popoff

2021
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:21,940
wife.
So what we did was we taped all this and

2022
01:23:21,941 --> 01:23:24,130
went to the Johnny Carson show.
This is how long ago that was.

2023
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:25,690
Now on this night show with Johnny
Carson.

2024
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:31,500
Randy takes it on the tonight show and
keep in mind that I'm pop off with tape

2025
01:23:31,991 --> 01:23:35,710
every single one of his shows and sort
of edit it real time as well.

2026
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:37,810
You put them on television.
Yeah,

2027
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:40,160
it will put them all on television.
This is how we make tons of.

2028
01:23:40,161 --> 01:23:41,470
I mean they were.
They had a,

2029
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:45,790
a monthly budget.
I think it was like $550,000 every

2030
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:46,520
single month,
you know,

2031
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,060
that,
that,

2032
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:47,501
that,
that,

2033
01:23:47,501 --> 01:23:49,510
that was a working budget,
that that's not the money.

2034
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:51,250
They will actually make it.
So God knows how much.

2035
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,500
So that's how much they were spending so
much they were spending.

2036
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:53,890
Yeah,
yeah,

2037
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:54,530
yeah,
yeah.

2038
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,260
So God,
what a dirty business.

2039
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:58,150
Yeah.
It's so dirty.

2040
01:23:58,151 --> 01:24:00,520
It's so dirty to just lie to people like
that.

2041
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:02,740
I,
if I would make a great evangelists if I

2042
01:24:02,741 --> 01:24:04,720
wasn't ethical,
there are times like,

2043
01:24:04,721 --> 01:24:05,740
Oh God,
you know,

2044
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:07,720
but I just couldn't do it.
I couldn't do it.

2045
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:11,740
So on the tonight show they play,
they play the footage that they have

2046
01:24:11,741 --> 01:24:15,970
from his TV show.
They play all that and then they.

2047
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,160
Oh,
and this was the one time that Johnny

2048
01:24:18,161 --> 01:24:19,810
always wanted to know everything that
was going to happen.

2049
01:24:19,811 --> 01:24:22,210
Like she didn't want any surprises,
but his staff said,

2050
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:22,681
no,
you,

2051
01:24:22,681 --> 01:24:24,640
you want to be surprised by this,
trust this.

2052
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:28,550
So sure enough they play that footage
and then they play the footage with pop

2053
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:31,720
offs wife and she's saying things like
pd.

2054
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,890
The first thing she says,
PD,

2055
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,140
nod your head if you can hear me,
because if you don't,

2056
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:38,410
we're going to have trouble tonight.
He nods his head as he's talking,

2057
01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:40,300
you know,
doing this whole event gelical thing.

2058
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,490
Um,
and uh,

2059
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:44,380
then she starts saying,
oh,

2060
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:47,200
there's a live one up in the back.
She's got cancer in her breast and make

2061
01:24:47,201 --> 01:24:49,300
her run up and down the island,
shake those breaths,

2062
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:50,740
you know,
it's just always like re.

2063
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:53,830
And there's a lot of nasty stuff.
Some of that stuff we couldn't play on

2064
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:55,570
this night show,
but we showed enough.

2065
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,080
And so just a disdain the marketing of
these people.

2066
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,080
She actually had breast cancer and she's
telling that these people do these real

2067
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:05,380
elements that all these people,
well,

2068
01:25:05,381 --> 01:25:08,380
almost real elements.
I'll get to that in a second because we

2069
01:25:08,381 --> 01:25:12,280
sent some stitches in and uh,
so yeah,

2070
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:13,630
just nasty,
nasty stuff.

2071
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:14,980
But anyway,
the stuff we showed him the tonight

2072
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:16,900
show,
Johnny sits there and he never,

2073
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:20,350
he didn't like to edit it shows either,
but he had to edit this because a moment

2074
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:22,480
that came on Johnny's like,
Oh shit.

2075
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,100
And you couldn't say shit on TV back
then.

2076
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,180
And so we had to edit that out at that
point and he says like,

2077
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,230
do they know about this?
And like,

2078
01:25:29,231 --> 01:25:30,160
nope,
they do now.

2079
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:33,580
And at first pop off,
try to say that we,

2080
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,331
we,
we,

2081
01:25:34,331 --> 01:25:36,340
uh,
we hired actors to be his wife.

2082
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:38,320
And then when it was obvious that we
didn't,

2083
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:41,260
he then came out and says,
I thought everybody knew that I use that

2084
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:46,261
to enhance the word of God.
And it took a long time for him to go

2085
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:47,240
onto that.
Here's,

2086
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,320
here's the crappy thing about this,
right when I was there,

2087
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:53,920
he's doing stuff like telling people to
throw their medications up on stage.

2088
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,900
You don't need them.
God's going to take care of,

2089
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,250
you know,
imagine somebody throws up some

2090
01:25:57,251 --> 01:25:58,930
digitalis pills or something they
really,

2091
01:25:58,931 --> 01:26:00,730
truly need and think God's going to heal
them.

2092
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,750
So people do die from these things.
And he was using a lot of other tricks.

2093
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:05,270
I,
Oh,

2094
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:07,160
I'm part of the way he was getting the
information was this,

2095
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:09,800
right?
So people fill out prayer cards ahead of

2096
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:13,790
time and they put them in these boxes in
the back of the room when nobody's

2097
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:16,640
really paying attention,
the boxes get switched out.

2098
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:20,370
So all those prayer cards with all this
information goes backstage.

2099
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:22,940
So the wife and she's able to send that
information to him.

2100
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:25,100
Another thing,
she would come out on stage,

2101
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:27,230
she would come out,
people come to these things for hours

2102
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:28,700
and hours ahead of time,
like literally and they leave the

2103
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:32,450
hospital on carts and everything else
and she would walk and she said,

2104
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:33,610
hi,
I'm Mrs Popoff go.

2105
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,720
I hope my husband gets to you tonight.
You know,

2106
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:36,561
where are you from?
Oh,

2107
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:37,061
that's nice.
Well,

2108
01:26:37,061 --> 01:26:38,690
what's wrong with you?
Oh I'm so well.

2109
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,850
I'll pray for you.
And she gets all this information again.

2110
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:42,710
She'd go back.
She had a big tape recorder in her purse

2111
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,660
and she would write that information
down.

2112
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:49,460
Another one was what I call like the
Kathryn Kuhlman trick and Catherine

2113
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:52,280
Coleman was an evangelist way,
way back who had all these great,

2114
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:55,970
great little like scam trick things.
And what they do is they wait for

2115
01:26:55,971 --> 01:27:00,971
somebody to come walk in with a cane and
then they can walk but not well,

2116
01:27:01,191 --> 01:27:03,260
and they're using a cane.
They walk up to them and say,

2117
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:05,210
you know what?
Wouldn't you be much more comfortable in

2118
01:27:05,211 --> 01:27:06,890
a wheelchair and we can put you up right
up front.

2119
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:09,710
You'll be right next to the reverend.
Who's going to say no to that?

2120
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,630
So they get pushed up in the wheelchair.
And as I pushed them along,

2121
01:27:12,631 --> 01:27:13,041
they said,
well,

2122
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:15,500
you're from WHO's your doctor?
You know what's wrong with getting all

2123
01:27:15,501 --> 01:27:17,240
this information?
Go back out,

2124
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:19,390
write the information down and giving
Mrs Popoff.

2125
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,090
So the wheelchair sitting there,
reverent comes out.

2126
01:27:23,091 --> 01:27:24,890
At some point he can look at that
person.

2127
01:27:24,891 --> 01:27:26,120
He didn't,
he said so name.

2128
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,740
And he says,
we've never talked before.

2129
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:29,000
We've never met before,
have we?

2130
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:31,880
Because they haven't.
It was the usher that was pushing him

2131
01:27:31,881 --> 01:27:33,680
down to gut that info.
He says,

2132
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:35,060
you know,
God says you can be healed.

2133
01:27:35,061 --> 01:27:35,820
Now.
God said,

2134
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,490
I'm getting from God that you can't
walk.

2135
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:39,560
Is that right?
And the guy sitting there,

2136
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:41,030
he's thinking,
this is a man of God,

2137
01:27:41,031 --> 01:27:43,040
right?
So I'm not contradicting him.

2138
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,950
And he must mean never be at a walk
properly again.

2139
01:27:45,951 --> 01:27:46,790
That's what he's saying.

2140
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:49,040
He's saying that my doctor says I can
never walk properly again.

2141
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:51,050
So he doesn't contradict him.
He says,

2142
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:54,230
I say you can.
God says you can stand up.

2143
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,360
The man stands up.
Well,

2144
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:58,340
that's your first miracle because
everybody else,

2145
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,730
their perception is this,
guys in that wheelchair cannot walk.

2146
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:04,250
He said,
take a few steps that it takes a few

2147
01:28:04,251 --> 01:28:05,450
steps.
You got that beat,

2148
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:06,081
it's war,
right?

2149
01:28:06,081 --> 01:28:07,790
So now you've got the emotion going even
more.

2150
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:09,350
Because here's a man that couldn't even
walk.

2151
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,860
He stood and now he walked,
pop off,

2152
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,380
then goes and gets in the wheelchair and
sits in it.

2153
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,990
He says,
walk to the back of the wheelchair and

2154
01:28:17,991 --> 01:28:19,670
the guy hobbles to the back of the
wheelchair.

2155
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:20,773
He says,
push me.

2156
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:23,150
And the guy pushes him.
Real miracle,

2157
01:28:23,151 --> 01:28:24,110
right?
But think about it.

2158
01:28:24,111 --> 01:28:26,390
That will chair is now acting like a
fricken walker.

2159
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:30,390
And then the great climax of the whole
piece of this trick is he takes the

2160
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,820
wheelchair,
puts it back where it is,

2161
01:28:31,821 --> 01:28:33,200
and he says to him,
now that's your wheelchair,

2162
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:35,210
meaning Joe,
like if you got up right now,

2163
01:28:35,211 --> 01:28:36,290
walked across the room and said,
Yo,

2164
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:37,400
that's your chair.
You'd say,

2165
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:39,440
yes,
will it actually is your jail.

2166
01:28:39,441 --> 01:28:41,520
You own it.
But I mean in normal circumstances I say

2167
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:42,620
you were in my studio.
You'd go,

2168
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:44,720
yes,
doesn't mean that your chair,

2169
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:46,710
it just means it's where you're sitting
in that moment.

2170
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,910
So the permits and sits down and you've
seen this whole miracle.

2171
01:28:49,911 --> 01:28:53,450
So he's got all these tricks like that.
The old trick of one leg is longer than

2172
01:28:53,451 --> 01:28:55,560
the other and you make them both the
same size.

2173
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:57,410
Also,
people get caught up in the moment and

2174
01:28:57,411 --> 01:28:59,690
they're on television.
They want it to be real.

2175
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:02,440
And the good,
I think an interesting.

2176
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,980
That's a lot of things,
but I don't think so.

2177
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:07,500
In this case,
I think this is more of a religious

2178
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:10,140
thing that people truly believe.
And when you have.

2179
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:12,300
It's like when I was talking tongues,
when I was yelling,

2180
01:29:12,301 --> 01:29:13,480
you know,
I've got all this stuff,

2181
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:15,440
me and I got all this adrenaline flowing
through my body.

2182
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:18,180
When you get caught up in it,
it's like when I was watching it,

2183
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:19,200
you know,
I'm getting caught up.

2184
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:22,200
I'm having all this reaction in my body
despite the fact I know it's all

2185
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:24,330
bullshit.
I'm still having this,

2186
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,860
this entire reaction,
you know,

2187
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:26,933
it's,
it's,

2188
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:28,590
you know,
mediums to me.

2189
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:32,040
The worst scum out there right now are
the mediums and why do I say that?

2190
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:34,590
Because they're taking advantage of a
person in a vulnerable moment in their

2191
01:29:34,591 --> 01:29:36,870
life and they're doing it for that long
game.

2192
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:39,150
They're also doing it for money and a
lot of people will say,

2193
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:42,000
well,
then making them feel good.

2194
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:44,370
You know what?
I can give crack to a junkie.

2195
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:45,930
It doesn't mean it's good for him,
right?

2196
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:50,040
The grieving process is a natural part
of the state that you have to go through

2197
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:53,730
to stay with the living.
We had a very good friend whose son died

2198
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:55,230
of cancer,
10 years old,

2199
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:58,680
died of cancer.
She's understanding he has this huge

2200
01:29:58,681 --> 01:29:59,640
gaping hole,
right,

2201
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:00,910
is huge,
gaping hole,

2202
01:30:00,911 --> 01:30:02,910
which she's just feeling sad.
She's upset,

2203
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:07,050
she needs to fill it with something.
Normally you turn to your family for

2204
01:30:07,051 --> 01:30:08,370
those things,
but she met.

2205
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:11,460
She met a medium who convinced the she
could talk to her dead son,

2206
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:13,980
so she stopped talking to her two living
daughters.

2207
01:30:13,981 --> 01:30:16,290
She stopped talking to her husband,
she started talking to the meat,

2208
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,930
even talking to her dead son,
almost ended up with a divorce,

2209
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:24,080
almost lost her entire life as a result,
and this happens all the time and it is

2210
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:26,170
so,
so sad and dirty,

2211
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:29,670
very dirty people on long island medium
you ever watched.

2212
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:34,680
So Theresa Caputo
and the worst part is the networks that

2213
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,320
edit the stuff to make it look even
better.

2214
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,540
If they don't give a fuck,
they're just trying to make money and

2215
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:41,760
just try to make money.
That's all they don't care about.

2216
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,820
Somehow or another feel like they're not
a part of the scam.

2217
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:47,100
I mean,
they're literally committing fraud.

2218
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:48,000
They aren't there.
No,

2219
01:30:48,001 --> 01:30:49,680
I agree.
They're perpetrating the fraud.

2220
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:51,690
Well,
the network is not involved with what it

2221
01:30:51,691 --> 01:30:52,950
is,
is a production company.

2222
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,050
The production company is bringing it to
the network,

2223
01:30:55,051 --> 01:30:59,550
but the network should know the process
and knows what's going on.

2224
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:01,080
They know it's bullshit,
but it's like,

2225
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:03,210
you know what?
I was going to get ratings.

2226
01:31:03,211 --> 01:31:04,680
It's going to do this.
Let's promote it,

2227
01:31:04,681 --> 01:31:05,700
let's push it.
You know,

2228
01:31:05,701 --> 01:31:09,240
they show up on set on Psi Phi and the
network.

2229
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:11,430
They didn't want me just debunking
everything.

2230
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:12,630
No,
and I had to tell them,

2231
01:31:12,631 --> 01:31:14,700
I said,
the problem is everything's bullshit.

2232
01:31:14,701 --> 01:31:16,800
Yeah.
It's not that I'm trying to debunk

2233
01:31:16,801 --> 01:31:18,600
everything.
We're just really looking at it.

2234
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:20,070
Yeah,
everything's bullshit.

2235
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:23,310
Well,
it's why in my show I started to go on

2236
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:26,130
this a little bit ago that showed
telepathy where I talk about telepathy

2237
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:28,320
and what it is and everything else,
but as I'm doing it,

2238
01:31:28,321 --> 01:31:32,700
I'm performing and there's a part in
that show where I feel really,

2239
01:31:32,701 --> 01:31:35,370
really dirty and I feel really,
really bad,

2240
01:31:35,371 --> 01:31:39,250
but I feel like I have to do it.
And I actually talked to some people's

2241
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:42,540
dead relatives in that show and it's
like the most despicable,

2242
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:45,480
horrible thing and it makes me want to
cry every time I do it,

2243
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:47,940
but it's because in the second half of
the show I go,

2244
01:31:47,941 --> 01:31:49,410
what is telepathy?
Well,

2245
01:31:49,411 --> 01:31:50,520
I think I know what it is.

2246
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,050
I think it's a,
a,

2247
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:54,960
a subset of magic.
I think it's a form of entertainment and

2248
01:31:54,961 --> 01:31:58,460
a very cruel form of entertainment.
I know I played with emotions if any of

2249
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,300
you here this,
but how else can I convince you on an

2250
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:06,100
emotional level?
And on a logical level that is bullshit.

2251
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:07,030
Because here's the thing,
right?

2252
01:32:07,031 --> 01:32:11,200
It's like your friend.
They've had this one experience that's

2253
01:32:11,201 --> 01:32:14,590
an emotional experience meeting the
psychic and the psychic telling them,

2254
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:15,970
if you tell them,
hey,

2255
01:32:15,971 --> 01:32:18,700
well I got this friend band check,
they could do that same thing for you.

2256
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:19,541
He's going,
Oh yeah,

2257
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:19,841
yeah,
yeah,

2258
01:32:19,841 --> 01:32:21,040
but this is,
you know,

2259
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:23,470
or if I do it,
say Bennett checks are real soft,

2260
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:25,750
they train us to meet up and then I do
it.

2261
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:26,381
And he goes,
wow,

2262
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:28,570
that God's real.
Then now you say it's bullshit,

2263
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,790
now they'll think a little bit and go,
well,

2264
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:31,180
you know what?

2265
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:34,060
I had that same emotional experience.
I had that same feeling.

2266
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:36,910
Maybe maybe I'll look at it.
My job,

2267
01:32:36,911 --> 01:32:39,160
I feel he's never to break down a
person's belief systems,

2268
01:32:39,161 --> 01:32:40,630
you know,
you can believe whatever you want,

2269
01:32:40,631 --> 01:32:41,351
you know,
that's fine.

2270
01:32:41,351 --> 01:32:42,880
So long as you're not hurting anybody
else,

2271
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:46,870
I'm Kinda sorta okay with it.
But the big thing is the problem that I

2272
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:50,440
have is with the people that have taken
advantage of those people's beliefs,

2273
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,720
cause it's always wolves in sheep's
clothing.

2274
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,480
They're taking advantage of people go
down these side streets and there's

2275
01:32:55,481 --> 01:32:58,300
these houses,
there's little houses that are sided

2276
01:32:58,390 --> 01:33:00,490
houses where people live in them and
some of them do,

2277
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:03,420
like you look at those houses,
they're like fricking like beautiful.

2278
01:33:03,421 --> 01:33:08,020
And they look like these people must be
making money like huge money somehow

2279
01:33:08,021 --> 01:33:10,810
unless they're laundering money or
something on the side as well.

2280
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,120
I mean there's enough people that
believe in.

2281
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:19,160
Unfortunately they're good at it.
They just hustle people and yeah,

2282
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,360
it's a weird legal scam.
I mean to,

2283
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:26,530
in order to like the government's
constantly shutting down cults and all

2284
01:33:26,531 --> 01:33:31,180
sorts of things that are not legit that
they find to be dangerous,

2285
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:33,310
but they somehow or another allow
people,

2286
01:33:33,311 --> 01:33:36,160
like some of them had got arrested
recently for scamming someone out of

2287
01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:39,100
hundreds of thousands of dollars and it
was the same sort of a thing.

2288
01:33:39,101 --> 01:33:42,970
She was a psychic and she was saying
that she needed all this money for.

2289
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:44,940
Right,
for some fucking Mino about where I'll

2290
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,760
frames,
right?

2291
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,260
No.
So he was like,

2292
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:47,980
he,
he,

2293
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:49,230
I think he like,
he,

2294
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:53,680
he was like a multi millions and
millions of dollars and there was a long

2295
01:33:53,681 --> 01:33:56,470
scan that went on for a long time.
I think it was a,

2296
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,040
what was it?

2297
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,350
I think I ever down there somewhere,
I don't know where.

2298
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:01,280
But anyway,
round frames,

2299
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:01,930
he was,
uh,

2300
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:04,180
he,
he basically grew trees and replanted

2301
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:07,180
trees and old trees and everything he
said made millions and millions off

2302
01:34:07,181 --> 01:34:09,280
this.
So there was this lady,

2303
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,860
uh,
he got scammed for five point $5,000,000

2304
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,830
over the course of a long period of
time,

2305
01:34:14,831 --> 01:34:18,430
but it all started out with the,
he met this lady and a psychic

2306
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:20,560
bookstore,
a,

2307
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:23,500
she gave him a bit of a reading and
through the reading she found out that

2308
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:26,890
his dad wasn't well and she said that
she had taken care of her dad through

2309
01:34:26,891 --> 01:34:29,230
hospice and everything,
but she had actually done it herself.

2310
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:33,400
She ended up moving in with him.
She ended up getting him because she was

2311
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:34,810
doing readings,
convinced him he,

2312
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:37,410
she was psychic.
She ended up getting him buying him like

2313
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:39,920
at $950,000 home,
uh,

2314
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,170
which will all these investments.

2315
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,290
She ended up taking over all of his
finances.

2316
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:46,240
She moved in with him romantically.
No,

2317
01:34:46,241 --> 01:34:47,470
no,
this is the weird part,

2318
01:34:47,471 --> 01:34:48,790
right.
So she didn't,

2319
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:50,860
she was rude in as the caretaker for
the,

2320
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,320
for the father.
Um,

2321
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,420
but in the process of all this,
she's getting,

2322
01:34:55,421 --> 01:34:59,120
she's now taking over his finances.
She's convinced that they're going

2323
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:00,860
bankrupt.
They got to pay the taxes.

2324
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,080
That tax money is getting funneled
through her,

2325
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:07,070
gets deeper than this.
One day he's at the bus station.

2326
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:10,010
There's this blonde hair,
beautiful girl with an English accent

2327
01:35:10,011 --> 01:35:15,011
that comes on over and she starts giving
him a reading and he ends up marrying or

2328
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:17,900
thinks he actually marries us.
Go at some point.

2329
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:21,920
Turns out this goal is the daughter of
the other woman.

2330
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:25,400
Her name is portia.
And what did they call their kid?

2331
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:28,160
They called their kid a Giorgio Armani.
Now.

2332
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,300
Now,
now here's the thing,

2333
01:35:29,301 --> 01:35:30,770
right?
They had a kid together,

2334
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:35,600
but he thought he had a kid with her.
It turns out the kid was a cousin's baby

2335
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:38,060
that she brought in the House and acted
like she had the baby.

2336
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,640
Wait a minute.
No,

2337
01:35:39,641 --> 01:35:41,090
no.
You can look this all up online.

2338
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:42,710
It's all online.
I like being.

2339
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:45,080
Well,
she used the baby bump thing,

2340
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:47,960
you know,
and then she acted like she had a second

2341
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:50,000
kid,
but she lost that child and everything

2342
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:52,310
else.
And the only way they got caught is

2343
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:54,740
because the boyfriend of,
I think the mother,

2344
01:35:54,741 --> 01:35:58,280
I think it was.
We're now in the same day and bought

2345
01:35:58,281 --> 01:36:01,850
these these cars for like a million but
box almost close to that,

2346
01:36:01,851 --> 01:36:03,110
you know,
that he just went out and spent the

2347
01:36:03,111 --> 01:36:05,010
money.
So the US government started coming,

2348
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:05,571
come in and say,
wait,

2349
01:36:05,571 --> 01:36:06,320
what's going on here?

2350
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,810
How is this going down?
And it all came to light up,

2351
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:09,813
but as.
Yeah,

2352
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:11,160
yeah,
Ralph rains,

2353
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,760
so I want to believe Shit,
you know,

2354
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:16,670
they just want to believe and it's a
strange thing.

2355
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:19,880
I wonder what that is.
Do you think that that's some sort of.

2356
01:36:19,881 --> 01:36:24,881
There's some sort of an evolutionary
aspect to thought were like to find

2357
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:30,461
things that are hidden or secrets is a
part of our thirst for innovation or a

2358
01:36:30,801 --> 01:36:33,430
thirst to.
To invent things or to.

2359
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:36,770
To figure out problems more to,
to,

2360
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:39,110
to not be deceived.
I think it's part of survival,

2361
01:36:39,111 --> 01:36:40,580
right?
You're always looking for that next

2362
01:36:40,581 --> 01:36:43,430
evolution of what,
what's gonna work and if we could read

2363
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:46,160
minds that would help us in our lives,
right?

2364
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,190
It would say it was a lot of pain.
If I know that she's really cheating on

2365
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:51,890
me or she's lying to me or he's lying to
me or,

2366
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:56,990
but it's not just a psychic energy
that's like ghosts and all the other

2367
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:57,770
stuff too.

2368
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:59,790
It all seems connected,
but it,

2369
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:04,760
it is that almost evolutionary to say I
think we always strive to better

2370
01:37:04,761 --> 01:37:08,690
ourselves and to get that kind of
knowledge and if there's a possibility,

2371
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:09,920
there's an afterlife.
Wow,

2372
01:37:09,921 --> 01:37:14,060
what does that really mean for me as a
human being and sort of the evolutionary

2373
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:17,270
scale now I'm just thinking about things
that I do in a very different manner.

2374
01:37:17,271 --> 01:37:19,310
Right?
It's also like this weird desire that

2375
01:37:19,311 --> 01:37:21,140
people have to know things that are
hidden.

2376
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:24,220
Those.
One of the reasons why that's the

2377
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:25,670
conspiracies.
Yeah.

2378
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:26,301
Right.
I mean,

2379
01:37:26,301 --> 01:37:27,680
that is part of survival.
It's like,

2380
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,290
Hey,
I wonder what's behind that cave right

2381
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:30,711
there.
Oh,

2382
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:32,330
I wonder what's over the top of that
mountain.

2383
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:36,260
Are there any animals over there that I
can hunt in that field whatsoever there?

2384
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:38,690
Where's a better place to fish right
now?

2385
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:39,980
Where's the better place to hunt?

2386
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:43,810
And it's all about survival I think.
I think really on some level it's a

2387
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:47,690
really screwed up thing that's in our
head pattern that helps us sort of

2388
01:37:47,691 --> 01:37:48,640
survived.
You know,

2389
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:51,350
you talk about people wanting to believe
things.

2390
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:52,431
You know,
there was a guy,

2391
01:37:52,431 --> 01:37:54,350
there was a Russian psychic.
He Frankel,

2392
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:57,270
I think his name was.
Now imagine this Joe.

2393
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,070
So you're a conductor on a train,
right?

2394
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:03,180
And you're going down some tracks with a
train and you see a guy in a white suit

2395
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:05,490
just looking at the side,
looking down towards you,

2396
01:38:05,491 --> 01:38:08,070
coming down the tracks,
puts down a briefcase,

2397
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:11,070
steps right in front of the train,
stares at the train,

2398
01:38:11,071 --> 01:38:13,320
puts his hand up in sort of a stop
motion,

2399
01:38:13,321 --> 01:38:15,570
but you can't stop car.
Hit Him and knock him.

2400
01:38:15,571 --> 01:38:17,760
You killed the guy.
He's in a million pieces of whatever

2401
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:20,070
happened to him and actual real guy.

2402
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,550
They opened up the briefcase and inside
there's a letter says,

2403
01:38:23,551 --> 01:38:26,940
I stopped a bicycle.
I stopped the car,

2404
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,690
I stopped a street car,
and now I'm going to do the ultimate

2405
01:38:30,691 --> 01:38:31,860
thing.
I'm going to stop a train.

2406
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:34,980
This was a psychic who believed he had
powers.

2407
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,680
Now my thinking on this,
I'm going,

2408
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:38,311
first of all,
I'm going,

2409
01:38:38,311 --> 01:38:40,110
Yay.
Probably stepped in front of a bicycle

2410
01:38:40,111 --> 01:38:42,030
and of course it stopped.
The president put the brakes on,

2411
01:38:42,031 --> 01:38:43,830
you know,
he stood in front of her car and it also

2412
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:44,790
stopped,
of course,

2413
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:48,000
and the street car.
I just got lucky with the train was a

2414
01:38:48,001 --> 01:38:50,490
huge mistake.
They say it can't stop in time,

2415
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:54,390
but this guy really truly believe he had
these abilities and then I get really,

2416
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:57,060
really cynical and I started thinking
because I think about my ex wife and

2417
01:38:57,061 --> 01:38:59,670
stuff and crazy stuff and I go,
I go,

2418
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,110
yeah,
maybe had an ex wife,

2419
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,180
maybe not an ex wife,
but a wife who said to him,

2420
01:39:03,181 --> 01:39:04,014
Hey,
you know,

2421
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:06,960
frankly,
I bet you can stop a bicycle,

2422
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,960
hire some guy next door to take a bike,
you know,

2423
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:10,920
and stuff like that.

2424
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:14,370
I bet you can stop a car.
Same Guy in the car,

2425
01:39:14,371 --> 01:39:15,840
you know,
stop slams on the brake.

2426
01:39:15,841 --> 01:39:17,700
You know,
he happens also to be the street car

2427
01:39:17,701 --> 01:39:18,710
driver as well,
you know,

2428
01:39:18,711 --> 01:39:20,460
so he stops and everything else.
She says,

2429
01:39:20,461 --> 01:39:22,470
you know what?
You really have these powers and you

2430
01:39:22,471 --> 01:39:24,390
should step in front of a train and try
to stop.

2431
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:27,240
So,
but that's just me being cynical.

2432
01:39:27,241 --> 01:39:27,960
So.
Yeah.

2433
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,340
Well,
it's a good way to think,

2434
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:32,940
especially when you've pulled off what
you've pulled off and seen what you've

2435
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:33,774
seen.
Yeah.

2436
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,600
Yeah.
You should have a show where you bust

2437
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,420
these mediums.
We have a show right now.

2438
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,340
Um,
but it's not really.

2439
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:43,110
Here's the intro.
It's like you said,

2440
01:39:43,111 --> 01:39:46,200
right?
Networks don't want a debunking show.

2441
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,120
Yeah.
Because that kills all their other show.

2442
01:39:48,330 --> 01:39:52,110
We had a show years ago where we came
out and said it was all an illusion,

2443
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,610
but they called it magical miracle.

2444
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:58,140
And Gallo is on that show and they had
taped blowing out of the water.

2445
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,690
Basically gallows saying stuff that he
denied.

2446
01:40:00,691 --> 01:40:02,580
He said later on,
but they had the tape of it and they

2447
01:40:02,581 --> 01:40:05,100
could have shown that,
but they wanted to keep that thing of

2448
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:07,950
magic or miracle.
And that was geller a fraud.

2449
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:12,540
Did girl trick you gotta be careful how
you say this because he loves to sue

2450
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:13,211
people.
Oh,

2451
01:40:13,211 --> 01:40:16,080
okay.
But he started to sell people right now

2452
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:19,260
that he's the world's greatest magician,
but he's got to be careful with that

2453
01:40:19,261 --> 01:40:22,320
because he sued people who said that he
was a magician and everything else,

2454
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:27,450
it is my opinion from everything that
I've seen and the Times that I've

2455
01:40:27,451 --> 01:40:30,450
watched him,
that he is cheating and he is using

2456
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:34,260
tricks.
And I know that I know for a fact he

2457
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:37,290
uses some of my methods now as well.

2458
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:42,800
I also know when I was working on the
show phenomenon the first time I told

2459
01:40:43,171 --> 01:40:45,430
this story ever,
um,

2460
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:48,380
so on,
I worked on a TV show for now

2461
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:50,100
phenomenon.
It was finding the next year he,

2462
01:40:50,101 --> 01:40:51,690
Gallo Criss Angel was on that show as
well.

2463
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:56,691
And they were the judges on the show and
I'm geller calls me out of the blue,

2464
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,950
which was really unexpected because I've
always been on the other side of the

2465
01:40:59,951 --> 01:41:01,390
fence of gala,
you know,

2466
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:03,370
with Randy and the skeptical movement in
that.

2467
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:06,070
And um,
he calls me up and he says,

2468
01:41:06,071 --> 01:41:07,810
hey,
how you doing?

2469
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:08,561
I said,
I'm doing good.

2470
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:09,394
He says,
well,

2471
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:11,100
you know,
you're known as the guy that creates a

2472
01:41:11,101 --> 01:41:11,741
stuff,
you know,

2473
01:41:11,741 --> 01:41:14,890
every mentalist working today is getting
a couple of your effects that you've

2474
01:41:14,891 --> 01:41:16,240
created.
Um,

2475
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:16,931
and he says,
you know,

2476
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:20,710
I only have like four or five powers
that I've had through the years and if

2477
01:41:20,711 --> 01:41:23,530
anybody could come up with a new psychic
ability for me,

2478
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:24,400
it would be you.

2479
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:27,280
And I went,
wow.

2480
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:28,660
How ballsy is that?
Right?

2481
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:32,260
He's calling sort of like one of his
hoping that you're hoping.

2482
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:35,230
No,
he's hoping I can create a new trick for

2483
01:41:35,231 --> 01:41:37,660
him that he can tell the world is
psychic.

2484
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:40,030
Right.
But he's also must be hoping that you're

2485
01:41:40,031 --> 01:41:41,630
not going to expose them.
Well,

2486
01:41:41,631 --> 01:41:42,700
this is the great thing,
right?

2487
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:44,380
Like even right now when I'm saying
this,

2488
01:41:44,381 --> 01:41:46,720
this is when you hang up,
you know,

2489
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:47,870
I go,
why would he do that?

2490
01:41:47,871 --> 01:41:50,530
And I thought,
well it was just a phone call between me

2491
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:52,190
and him.
He knows I wasn't expecting it.

2492
01:41:52,191 --> 01:41:55,180
So I'm not recording it.
It's my word against his word.

2493
01:41:56,110 --> 01:42:01,110
And he can say that I misunderstood that
maybe he wanted me to need to come up

2494
01:42:01,571 --> 01:42:04,630
with an idea of something for him to use
his psychic power.

2495
01:42:04,631 --> 01:42:06,010
So there's many ways you could spin it.

2496
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,960
When we worked with Chris Angel,
Chris,

2497
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:09,970
uh,
on one of his episodes had geller on

2498
01:42:09,971 --> 01:42:14,050
there and Chris put a spoon on the table
and he said,

2499
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:14,710
you know,
can you,

2500
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:16,390
can you bend that and your.
He said,

2501
01:42:16,391 --> 01:42:17,051
no.
He said,

2502
01:42:17,051 --> 01:42:18,070
well,
why not?

2503
01:42:18,071 --> 01:42:18,461
He said,
well,

2504
01:42:18,461 --> 01:42:19,600
my abilities aren't Oregon writing.
So.

2505
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:21,280
So if you bent at right now,
it would be a trick.

2506
01:42:21,281 --> 01:42:23,860
Right?
And I can't bend it right now.

2507
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:24,431
He says,
well,

2508
01:42:24,431 --> 01:42:25,840
if you did bend it,
it would be a trick.

2509
01:42:25,841 --> 01:42:27,730
Right?
And Gallo says,

2510
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,181
well,
yeah,

2511
01:42:28,181 --> 01:42:29,770
if I bent it right now,
it would be a trick.

2512
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:31,900
And Christmas I got him.
I got him,

2513
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:33,700
you know,
and when he walked away,

2514
01:42:33,701 --> 01:42:34,590
I said,
you don't have him.

2515
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:35,351
And he said,
well,

2516
01:42:35,351 --> 01:42:36,520
what do you mean?
He just said it was a trick.

2517
01:42:36,521 --> 01:42:36,851
I said,
no,

2518
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:37,870
he never said it was a trick.

2519
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:39,400
He said if he had to do it in that
moment,

2520
01:42:39,401 --> 01:42:41,800
it would be a trick because it's psychic
abilities weren't working.

2521
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:43,720
He never says he knows how to do it as a
trick.

2522
01:42:43,721 --> 01:42:45,040
He just said it would have to be a
trick.

2523
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:47,200
Sure enough,
I walked up together later on,

2524
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:47,861
he says,
you know,

2525
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:49,120
I didn't say that.
I use tricks.

2526
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:49,960
Right?
I go,

2527
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:51,190
yeah,
I know,

2528
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:51,850
you know,
he's,

2529
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:53,500
he's collaborative,
like very,

2530
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:56,050
very clever and very,
very slick.

2531
01:42:56,051 --> 01:42:56,561
So,
and I,

2532
01:42:56,561 --> 01:42:58,870
you know,
I think he's harmed science and took it

2533
01:42:58,871 --> 01:43:02,740
back and it was one of these things I
think why we had to do what we had to do

2534
01:43:02,741 --> 01:43:06,640
at the time because science was going in
this very weird pseudo science

2535
01:43:06,641 --> 01:43:07,451
direction.
I mean,

2536
01:43:07,451 --> 01:43:09,690
that was back in the days when you had,
um,

2537
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:13,120
old pyramids that would basically put a
razorblade supposedly,

2538
01:43:13,121 --> 01:43:13,750
and it would show up.

2539
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:16,590
And so you got all the pyramids of power
and you had.

2540
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,070
Yeah,
I remember that stuff.

2541
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:21,370
That stuff was put things into pyramids
that sharpened them.

2542
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:22,001
Yeah.
Yeah.

2543
01:43:22,001 --> 01:43:22,811
I didn't,
didn't work,

2544
01:43:22,811 --> 01:43:24,940
but it was just,
it's all pseudoscience,

2545
01:43:24,941 --> 01:43:25,870
but it was all this,
you know,

2546
01:43:25,871 --> 01:43:30,220
people wearing a tinfoil hats and just
written into the whole thing.

2547
01:43:30,221 --> 01:43:33,670
Went on and on and on and on.
It was a list of just the whole litany

2548
01:43:33,671 --> 01:43:37,120
of whatever happened to pop off,
pop off.

2549
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:39,310
I'm just disappeared.
Oh,

2550
01:43:39,311 --> 01:43:41,810
he's back on every night now you can
find him on every night.

2551
01:43:41,811 --> 01:43:43,000
Now the differences this.
Right.

2552
01:43:43,001 --> 01:43:46,420
So he was one of the first ones to send
out and you've probably seen them.

2553
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:49,810
He would send out these letters that
look like there were handwritten.

2554
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,070
It's obvious now we look at it,
we know it's

2555
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:52,940
not handwritten,
you know,

2556
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:55,190
that the printed.
But back then people weren't aware of

2557
01:43:55,191 --> 01:43:57,380
that and it looks like it's handwritten
and personal to you.

2558
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:00,520
And I would get,
because I just signed up when I was at

2559
01:44:00,521 --> 01:44:03,410
were there that day.
I would get an outline of a foot,

2560
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:06,200
wear this in your shoe and uh,
you know,

2561
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:08,360
wrap it up with $20,
$50,

2562
01:44:08,361 --> 01:44:09,590
$100,
whatever you put in,

2563
01:44:09,591 --> 01:44:12,140
you'll get tenfold back.
Hey,

2564
01:44:12,141 --> 01:44:14,000
you know,
you get this little piece of water and

2565
01:44:14,001 --> 01:44:17,180
it came from Bethlehem and you know
where that around your neck and then

2566
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:20,030
wrap it up with money and send that,
send that back.

2567
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:23,370
So he was making most of his money,
not at the,

2568
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:26,570
the events he was making it on the
mailings.

2569
01:44:26,571 --> 01:44:28,910
That's where they will making really
making all their money.

2570
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:32,920
Took a few years for him to disappear,
like about three,

2571
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:34,550
four years to him disappear.

2572
01:44:34,610 --> 01:44:36,980
And after this night show.
Yeah.

2573
01:44:36,981 --> 01:44:39,080
Yeah.
And then he came back,

2574
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:42,140
but the differences,
now he's not using any of those tricks.

2575
01:44:42,141 --> 01:44:44,570
It's more of a thing that he's on the
air and he's going,

2576
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:48,480
somebody out there has a headache right
now and I'm going to help kill you.

2577
01:44:48,481 --> 01:44:50,900
Have your migraines.
You don't have to if you're just on

2578
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:51,660
television.
Yeah.

2579
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:53,000
You don't have to do anything.
Right?

2580
01:44:53,001 --> 01:44:55,480
You just say that point.
There was a heart attack right now.

2581
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:57,170
Jesus gonna.
Stop at Jay's a stump.

2582
01:44:57,171 --> 01:44:59,360
That heart attack.
That's right guys.

2583
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:00,890
Guys on the couch.
Whoa.

2584
01:45:00,891 --> 01:45:04,010
Jesus.
He's having heartburn and it goes away.

2585
01:45:04,011 --> 01:45:04,850
It's like,
oh my Gosh,

2586
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:06,680
God just failed me.
I'm going to send them money.

2587
01:45:06,681 --> 01:45:08,360
Liter Pepsi.
Absolutely.

2588
01:45:08,361 --> 01:45:09,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

2589
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,130
So,
so that's,

2590
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:12,040
that's what he's doing now,
which is um,

2591
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:13,040
I don't know,
I just,

2592
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:14,750
I,
I don't think any of these we should be

2593
01:45:14,751 --> 01:45:16,340
tax exempt or anything like that.

2594
01:45:16,350 --> 01:45:18,560
So that's what's terrifying.
It's terrifying.

2595
01:45:18,561 --> 01:45:20,660
Is that they're tax exempt and obviously
a fraud.

2596
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:22,880
Like how has the government so lax in
that?

2597
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:25,130
I don't know.
I don't know if it's even this whole

2598
01:45:25,131 --> 01:45:28,520
thing of like I'm not for profit
organizations,

2599
01:45:28,521 --> 01:45:29,241
right?
I mean,

2600
01:45:29,241 --> 01:45:30,074
you know,
they,

2601
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:33,350
most of them are just fraud.
They're fakes as far as I think you

2602
01:45:33,351 --> 01:45:37,400
should have to prove that a certain
percentage is actually going to the

2603
01:45:37,401 --> 01:45:40,580
cause,
the problem with five percent whatever.

2604
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:42,230
And you can only have x amount of
employees.

2605
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:46,250
The rest of the volunteers and the
employees can get paid a lot of money to

2606
01:45:46,330 --> 01:45:48,780
nonprofit will be certain amount of
poise.

2607
01:45:48,781 --> 01:45:51,140
Maybe the president this and this.
They can only make x amount of dollars

2608
01:45:51,141 --> 01:45:53,450
in a nonprofit or organization.
They can't make more than that.

2609
01:45:53,451 --> 01:45:56,180
Or You lose your nonprofit status
because you're self sufficient at that

2610
01:45:56,181 --> 01:45:56,590
point.

2611
01:45:56,590 --> 01:45:57,141
Yeah,
no,

2612
01:45:57,141 --> 01:45:58,430
I,
I agree with you totally.

2613
01:45:58,431 --> 01:46:01,010
It's very disturbing to me that,
I mean,

2614
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:04,700
look,
scientology sued and won and they became

2615
01:46:04,701 --> 01:46:06,650
nonprofit.
I mean they are.

2616
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:09,770
Or rather they became tax exempt because
they're,

2617
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:10,940
what?
They had so much money.

2618
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:14,240
They had a religion.
Every member's money was pulled to be

2619
01:46:14,241 --> 01:46:17,000
able to sue anybody to the point to
where you couldn't win.

2620
01:46:17,001 --> 01:46:17,930
Right.
Well,

2621
01:46:17,931 --> 01:46:21,950
they were suing so many people that the
irs just gave it.

2622
01:46:21,970 --> 01:46:22,820
Right.
Yeah.

2623
01:46:22,821 --> 01:46:24,320
I mean,
it's really fascinating.

2624
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:28,160
It's fascinating how they did that.
They actually fought the irs and one.

2625
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:30,680
Right,
but they got that money from the people

2626
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:35,180
that they're the congregation.
It's an incredible story really.

2627
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:35,751
It,
it's just,

2628
01:46:35,751 --> 01:46:37,980
it's incredible that it's so obvious.
I mean,

2629
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:39,750
when you got.
I mean there's,

2630
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:41,660
there's religions,
right?

2631
01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:45,710
That we don't know the origin of.
I mean we really don't know who was the

2632
01:46:45,711 --> 01:46:50,610
original writer of this scroll is that
they're fine in Qumran we don't know who

2633
01:46:50,611 --> 01:46:51,510
wrote is too long ago.

2634
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:53,190
Right.
But with l Ron Hubbard,

2635
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:54,650
they got video of,
you know,

2636
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:56,520
they know the guy in the video,
the guy saying,

2637
01:46:56,521 --> 01:46:58,050
hey,
if you want to make a lot of money,

2638
01:46:58,730 --> 01:46:59,940
start a religion,
not a religion.

2639
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:02,140
And he did.
And and yeah,

2640
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:05,160
when he had the captain's outfit on with
ribbons,

2641
01:47:05,161 --> 01:47:07,740
he gave himself and metals like,
what the fuck?

2642
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:08,630
Well,
you know,

2643
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:11,130
that's,
that's the front with this stuff is so

2644
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:12,540
dangerous.
It's just so,

2645
01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:16,050
so dangerous in the wrong hands.
You recognize that it's dangerous

2646
01:47:16,051 --> 01:47:18,500
because you understand how easy people
are to be manipulated,

2647
01:47:18,501 --> 01:47:19,950
right?
Because you've been studying this your

2648
01:47:19,951 --> 01:47:22,040
whole life and you and you,
you know,

2649
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,940
in a form of it,
you do a show.

2650
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:29,150
What I really genuinely appreciate is
the way you and the way penn really go

2651
01:47:29,221 --> 01:47:31,590
out of their way to say that this is a
trick.

2652
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:32,460
This is bullshit.

2653
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:35,580
We're bullshitting you.
I'm not showing you spooky power.

2654
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:39,450
I got in a lot of trouble for that in my
early days of performing bind reading a

2655
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:41,430
mentalism.
The moment that I came out and I would

2656
01:47:41,431 --> 01:47:44,790
say to p because to me,
I think when you come out and you tell

2657
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:48,420
people it's not real and you can still
do it and they want to tell you that has

2658
01:47:48,421 --> 01:47:50,910
to be real.
That means something.

2659
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:51,361
Right.
That's.

2660
01:47:51,361 --> 01:47:53,460
That's impressive to me.
I think that's really impressive.

2661
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:55,910
There are a lot of performers who are
not good performance.

2662
01:47:55,911 --> 01:47:59,760
They started out not as good performance
and they need the people to believe in

2663
01:47:59,761 --> 01:48:03,840
them in order to get away with a
trickery and they never lose that.

2664
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:06,050
They always want people to believe.
It's a tricky one.

2665
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:08,790
So when I started coming out and I
started saying,

2666
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:09,780
hey,
it's magic.

2667
01:48:09,781 --> 01:48:11,280
It's verbal,
it's nonverbal communication.

2668
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,410
It's all this stuff mixed together to
create a show.

2669
01:48:13,411 --> 01:48:15,840
I'm not a psychic.
There is absolutely nothing psychic

2670
01:48:15,841 --> 01:48:19,140
about what I do.
There were quite a few mentalist and the

2671
01:48:19,141 --> 01:48:21,600
mentalism field back then.
There wasn't as many as there are now,

2672
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,620
who were upset with me dunked and said,
if you are a psychic man,

2673
01:48:25,621 --> 01:48:28,300
the best way to hide it,
to say you're not a psychic,

2674
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:29,223
right?
Yeah,

2675
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:31,320
no,
that wouldn't be true,

2676
01:48:31,321 --> 01:48:33,390
except that's not the case.
So what's up with the nails?

2677
01:48:33,391 --> 01:48:35,520
I don't know because we're two hours in
here.

2678
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,890
Tell me what's up with these nails a
nail.

2679
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:39,400
Okay.
Alright.

2680
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:41,220
Alright,
so this is what I want you to do.

2681
01:48:41,221 --> 01:48:42,630
I just,
you're going to have to describe what's

2682
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:43,231
happening.
Okay.

2683
01:48:43,231 --> 01:48:45,480
So this is one of the very first things
I started doing.

2684
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:49,170
Joe,
is this like the nail Polish and nail

2685
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:50,580
and I want you to watch what happens.

2686
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:52,350
Okay?
I'm watching what happens.

2687
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:53,670
Oh my God,
you're bending it.

2688
01:48:53,671 --> 01:48:56,080
This is incredible.
Your Business,

2689
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:59,820
you can see the nail is actually slowly,
slowly bending.

2690
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:01,840
Outrageous.
I like it.

2691
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:05,940
You're shaking your hand to showing your
powers and the thing about that,

2692
01:49:05,941 --> 01:49:07,200
take a look at.
It's not a trick nail.

2693
01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:09,690
It's nothing like that.
I mean everything I use from silverware

2694
01:49:09,691 --> 01:49:13,610
to forks to anything that I do is
actually just slowly do that.

2695
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:15,481
Yeah,
no,

2696
01:49:15,481 --> 01:49:17,850
but I was at the Va,
I was at the very end,

2697
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:18,430
right?
They're like,

2698
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:19,201
oh,
I can't,

2699
01:49:19,201 --> 01:49:20,310
I can't do that.
So here,

2700
01:49:20,350 --> 01:49:24,040
hold on another one maybe.
Yeah,

2701
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:28,020
I'm going to say let's keep got some
forks.

2702
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:28,913
Yeah,
I got some forks.

2703
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:30,720
So I want you,
I want you to point to a fork.

2704
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,220
Anyone?
Um,

2705
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:33,870
how about this one?
You want it or do you want me to have

2706
01:49:33,871 --> 01:49:35,330
that one?
I'll take that one.

2707
01:49:35,331 --> 01:49:36,001
You'll take it.
All right.

2708
01:49:36,001 --> 01:49:38,340
So.
So you've heard of people,

2709
01:49:38,341 --> 01:49:40,050
we've talked about people actually
bending silverware,

2710
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:43,560
but that one you can't.
Yeah,

2711
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:45,230
that's the one I want.
I'm going to use it.

2712
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:49,320
Give me that fucking for the time.
This I know what you doing.

2713
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,420
Give me that fork a fork that's taken
bullshit for.

2714
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:53,690
No,
you can have that fork.

2715
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:55,960
John,
let's take you a fork.

2716
01:49:58,950 --> 01:50:00,930
Joe.
Try and get this Florida watching.

2717
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,273
Um,
yeah.

2718
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:06,660
This was your four incredible.
Trying to get this from the far end.

2719
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:12,630
What kind of techniques are you using,
sir?

2720
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:15,170
Tell me then I'll trick forks.
Well,

2721
01:50:15,171 --> 01:50:16,610
we're going to eat with these.
Those are,

2722
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:18,710
those are actually 100 percent genuine
forks.

2723
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:21,440
Um,
but you can't tell me how you're doing

2724
01:50:21,441 --> 01:50:23,450
it.
It's sleight of hand.

2725
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:25,460
That's as much as I can tell you.
Okay,

2726
01:50:25,461 --> 01:50:27,380
let me do it.
Do it again so I could watch one more

2727
01:50:27,381 --> 01:50:28,900
time.
You want to watch one more time?

2728
01:50:28,901 --> 01:50:32,270
Okay.
I was hoping have like a bullshit fake

2729
01:50:32,271 --> 01:50:34,550
fork.
Not legit.

2730
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:37,100
If I was sitting with you,
I'll show you.

2731
01:50:38,270 --> 01:50:40,430
It's actually no,
it's easier if I'm sitting with you.

2732
01:50:40,431 --> 01:50:42,590
So let's do a here.
People can tell.

2733
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:45,020
Yep.
So what's this one?

2734
01:50:45,021 --> 01:50:45,854
Ready?
Here we go.

2735
01:50:46,590 --> 01:50:48,260
Okay.
So I'm going to shake it like that.

2736
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:52,290
Right?
You know what?

2737
01:50:52,291 --> 01:50:53,830
Let's do it this way.
Can you wait?

2738
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:55,650
Can I move this?
Yeah.

2739
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:59,190
So hope both hands out like this and I'm
just going to.

2740
01:50:59,191 --> 01:51:01,290
I'm going to hold it right there.
I want you to hold that in and hold that

2741
01:51:01,291 --> 01:51:01,831
in for me.
I'm gonna.

2742
01:51:01,831 --> 01:51:04,900
Have to make it what you want to do.
Hold this end as well with that.

2743
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:06,420
And I'm going to hold it right in the
center.

2744
01:51:06,421 --> 01:51:07,254
Right there.
Okay.

2745
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,390
You're rubbing it.
Watch.

2746
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:12,650
Oh,
you heating it up.

2747
01:51:13,130 --> 01:51:13,461
Wait,
wait.

2748
01:51:13,461 --> 01:51:13,741
Don't,
don't,

2749
01:51:13,741 --> 01:51:14,040
don't,
don't,

2750
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:15,190
don't force it.
Don't force it.

2751
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:18,320
Just hold it.
Can you feel that?

2752
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:20,240
Yeah.
Because it's a different kind of metal.

2753
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:21,080
No,
it's not.

2754
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:21,541
Yeah.
You're,

2755
01:51:21,541 --> 01:51:26,150
you're using some sort of fake ass metal
and now it's hard again,

2756
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:28,250
right,
because you're heating it up,

2757
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:29,170
right?
Is that what it is?

2758
01:51:29,870 --> 01:51:31,490
What?
I'm going to actually get this one to

2759
01:51:31,491 --> 01:51:34,040
break him,
but I'm better now.

2760
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,633
Chill.

2761
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:38,450
Wow.
Right?

2762
01:51:38,451 --> 01:51:41,180
Because it's some bullshit ass metal.
I promise you it's not.

2763
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:45,560
I have dvds out that teach musicians how
to do this.

2764
01:51:45,561 --> 01:51:48,620
Of course you got to be a magician.
No where to get it and it uses any fork

2765
01:51:48,621 --> 01:51:49,520
anywhere.
Anytime.

2766
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:54,300
Promise you.
But I got Monday.

2767
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:57,920
Ben.
No bending it

2768
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:02,450
this way.
If they were made out a special metal,

2769
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:05,240
I would never let you keep them because
it would be too expensive,

2770
01:52:05,241 --> 01:52:07,670
but this one's gonna twist all the way
around and that.

2771
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:11,280
That one's not made a special metal.
It's regular metal hold.

2772
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:13,880
I got to concentrate.
You do use it for real.

2773
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:16,430
What kind of wizardry is that,
sir?

2774
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:20,030
He spun this around and turn it into a
not.

2775
01:52:20,630 --> 01:52:22,640
The thing is he's not going to tell you
how he does it.

2776
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:23,930
That's the real problem.
No,

2777
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:27,530
you tell me that it's bullshit,
but you won't tell me how you're doing

2778
01:52:27,531 --> 01:52:31,220
this bullshit.
It's very unfortunate that there's

2779
01:52:31,221 --> 01:52:32,420
different techniques.
That's the thing,

2780
01:52:32,450 --> 01:52:33,230
right?
I mean,

2781
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:35,150
and I really hope you can come see a
show.

2782
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:38,240
Sometimes I do things like one person,
another person feels it.

2783
01:52:38,570 --> 01:52:40,250
I tell people to like,
name a number,

2784
01:52:40,251 --> 01:52:41,360
you know,
any number at all.

2785
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:43,070
Go ahead.
13.

2786
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:45,050
Okay.
And that would be a common number for

2787
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:46,550
lot of people to choose.
Sure.

2788
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:48,230
You know,
there are specific words,

2789
01:52:48,231 --> 01:52:49,630
if I said to you,
think of a number,

2790
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:52,040
a name,
anywhere it was seven letters or less.

2791
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:52,874
Go ahead.

2792
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:54,060
Okay,
go ahead.

2793
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:54,953
Con.

2794
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:57,960
Of course,
most people wouldn't.

2795
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:02,290
Most people that are common words.
No,

2796
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:05,540
that's not a common word.
I had no most people to choose on love

2797
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:08,540
or have something like that know along
those lines.

2798
01:53:08,541 --> 01:53:09,380
Uh,
you know,

2799
01:53:09,381 --> 01:53:11,540
a dog or cat,
a really common ones.

2800
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:12,620
Um,
but,

2801
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:14,510
but here's,
here's the interesting thing.

2802
01:53:14,511 --> 01:53:15,344
Okay.
Okay.

2803
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:18,590
So inside this wallet,
did you give up on the word because I

2804
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:20,220
have chosen or there was no,
no,

2805
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:23,450
yet inside this wallet I put it in car.
I was driving,

2806
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:28,030
I was driving earlier on and someone cut
you off and you know what doodling,

2807
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,890
doodling is when you kind of scribbled
without even looking.

2808
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:33,700
And as you notice inside the hair,
you open it up.

2809
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:36,830
Tell me what's on there.
So I didn't want to touch it.

2810
01:53:38,670 --> 01:53:40,910
What does it say?
It's hard to read.

2811
01:53:41,190 --> 01:53:42,320
Yeah,
it's my handwriting.

2812
01:53:42,321 --> 01:53:44,230
And doodling.
This is a 13 and count.

2813
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,193
It does

2814
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:49,353
shit.

2815
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:54,590
Well,
it's such bad handwriting that I got to

2816
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:57,570
think that you wrote that underneath the
table.

2817
01:53:57,590 --> 01:53:58,890
It's definitely a 13.
Right?

2818
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:00,360
And,
and yeah.

2819
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:02,640
Yeah.
Wrote it onto the table while we're

2820
01:54:02,641 --> 01:54:04,340
doing this.
What did end up inside the wallet?

2821
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,380
Because he just shoved it in there.
Oh,

2822
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:09,060
let's try this.
What's that one?

2823
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:11,280
All right.
We'll try this.

2824
01:54:11,281 --> 01:54:12,590
I can't promise I'm going to be able to
do.

2825
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:13,650
Okay.
You know what?

2826
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:15,120
I got both of you in here.
Let's do this.

2827
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:17,360
What are we going to do?
Right?

2828
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:20,270
He's got a bunch of cards on him and
second deck of cards,

2829
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:21,410
right?
That is great.

2830
01:54:21,630 --> 01:54:23,820
We have 13 and current written on the
piece of paper.

2831
01:54:23,821 --> 01:54:26,790
I should have washed your hands closer.
I'm a fan of cards out job.

2832
01:54:26,970 --> 01:54:28,690
Okay.
I'm not picking it now.

2833
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:30,260
I'm not going to actually have to pick
one up.

2834
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:31,830
I am in sort of.
I'm going to find it.

2835
01:54:31,831 --> 01:54:33,450
I'm not going to fanning because I'm not
a magician.

2836
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:36,900
I'm going to show you the card payment.
You're not a magician.

2837
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:38,720
I'm a mentalist.
What?

2838
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:40,930
I'm going to find the cards.
I want you to think of any card,

2839
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:43,620
any card.
I say you get one.

2840
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:44,550
Okay.
You see it?

2841
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:45,960
Yes.
Did you get a red card?

2842
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:48,210
Excuse me?
You get a red card?

2843
01:54:48,570 --> 01:54:49,310
Yes.
Good.

2844
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:51,600
So she got a red card and we do.
Same with you across the table.

2845
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:53,760
I want you to think of any call to get a
black card.

2846
01:54:53,761 --> 01:54:54,594
Okay.

2847
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:56,713
Do you get one?
Yeah.

2848
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:58,890
All right.
I'm going to ask one question because I

2849
01:54:58,891 --> 01:55:01,440
have to ask questions sometimes.
Try to figure out exactly what it is

2850
01:55:01,441 --> 01:55:02,610
you're thinking.
Okay.

2851
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,560
Did either one of you choose a high
card?

2852
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:06,173
Yes.

2853
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,610
No.

2854
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:08,690
Okay.
Hi.

2855
01:55:08,691 --> 01:55:10,310
Cards are hard for me to get,
but I will try.

2856
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:11,540
All right.
Look at me.

2857
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:12,161
Don't,
don't,

2858
01:55:12,161 --> 01:55:14,450
don't.
She got a red card.

2859
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:16,690
I'm going to say your card is probably
hearts.

2860
01:55:20,010 --> 01:55:21,300
Your card over there,
Jamie.

2861
01:55:21,301 --> 01:55:24,960
It's black.
Probably.

2862
01:55:24,961 --> 01:55:25,890
Spades.

2863
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:29,633
Nailed it

2864
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,030
for two spades.

2865
01:55:31,890 --> 01:55:32,723
Yes.

2866
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:35,830
Hearts Klinghardt's.
Yeah.

2867
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:37,740
Yeah.
Well,

2868
01:55:37,741 --> 01:55:38,750
let me see.
That deck of cards.

2869
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:40,830
We only had three choices.
Yeah.

2870
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,960
I had a queen of spades and eight of
spades.

2871
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:44,100
The two of spades and

2872
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,410
I switched from the queen of spades.
Before you asked that question.

2873
01:55:46,411 --> 01:55:47,870
Higher low.
I went low.

2874
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:49,400
Low.
Went low.

2875
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:50,520
Yeah.
Why did you do that?

2876
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:53,180
Because I thought it was,
but I was going to go.

2877
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:55,980
He mind fucked.
You thought I was going to go high.

2878
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:58,050
There's a lot of these kinds of things.
It's verbal.

2879
01:55:58,051 --> 01:55:59,780
Nonverbal.
Which magical psychologist.

2880
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:01,080
A mixture of all kinds of different
things.

2881
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:02,490
Twisted up a spoon.
It's on.

2882
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,620
That shouldn't.
Yeah,

2883
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:06,180
I did that.
I definitely want you to come.

2884
01:56:06,181 --> 01:56:07,830
We go into the magic castle tonight,
by the way.

2885
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:08,610
Are you?
Yeah.

2886
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:11,130
You're welcome to come.
If it to the comedy store.

2887
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:12,760
You're walking.
Yeah,

2888
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,940
I'm working.
What time you work in there rather come

2889
01:56:14,941 --> 01:56:18,360
and see you so I'm not working.
You're not going to go ahead and see

2890
01:56:18,361 --> 01:56:20,730
some friends.
My scrubs is actually a good friend of

2891
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:21,900
mine,
Steve Valentine,

2892
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:23,460
I don't know if you know Steve is
inactive.

2893
01:56:23,870 --> 01:56:25,830
No,
I don't really graves and crossing

2894
01:56:25,831 --> 01:56:29,040
Jordan and stuff like that and he's got
an interesting story about his life and

2895
01:56:29,041 --> 01:56:30,570
it's not that a psychological thing as
well,

2896
01:56:30,571 --> 01:56:34,620
which I'm always fascinated with where
he was performing magic for years,

2897
01:56:34,621 --> 01:56:38,340
constantly performing magic and um,
he wouldn't be enacted and the magic was

2898
01:56:38,341 --> 01:56:40,620
kind of a side thing for him,
but it started getting away.

2899
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:42,900
He'd go on interviews and stuff and they
say,

2900
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:46,080
you know,
aren't you that guy that does kit shows,

2901
01:56:46,081 --> 01:56:48,300
I want you to do a party for me and so
forth.

2902
01:56:48,301 --> 01:56:51,800
And he could never get the part.
So he started denying that he was a,

2903
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:55,070
a magician.
I just totally left magic completely.

2904
01:56:55,110 --> 01:56:55,501
People say,
yeah,

2905
01:56:55,501 --> 01:56:56,450
I got your business card.
No,

2906
01:56:56,451 --> 01:56:57,850
that's not me.
That wasn't me.

2907
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:01,530
That's when he started to be able to act
and he started getting the acting jobs

2908
01:57:01,531 --> 01:57:01,960
and everything.

2909
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:05,220
It wasn't till years later that he could
go back and be a performer.

2910
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:08,100
Wow.
And it's a really interesting story,

2911
01:57:08,101 --> 01:57:10,920
but he does it with magic and teaching
and things and yeah.

2912
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:13,620
Do you ever work with comedy and Magic
Club in Hermosa?

2913
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:14,281
No.
No.

2914
01:57:14,281 --> 01:57:15,240
I never have.
No.

2915
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,550
Yeah,
it's interesting because he mixes comedy

2916
01:57:17,551 --> 01:57:19,920
and magic together.
Like you'll have like a magician on the

2917
01:57:19,921 --> 01:57:22,610
show with comedian.
This was a few of those back in the days

2918
01:57:22,611 --> 01:57:25,230
that I worked where it was comedy Magic
Club type thing.

2919
01:57:25,231 --> 01:57:27,630
So yeah,
it's a good nights.

2920
01:57:28,230 --> 01:57:31,770
Did you ever teach this stuff?
I teach to other magicians.

2921
01:57:31,850 --> 01:57:34,230
I have,
I have videos of stuff.

2922
01:57:34,231 --> 01:57:35,450
I have books.
Uh,

2923
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:38,310
so I definitely do teach,
but I don't teach one on one.

2924
01:57:38,311 --> 01:57:40,020
I never teach it.
I just don't have time to teach one on

2925
01:57:40,021 --> 01:57:42,210
one.
I'm always so busy working and trying to

2926
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:43,290
teach like this stuff.

2927
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:46,920
Like how do you do these things?
The metal bending have dvds out on that.

2928
01:57:46,921 --> 01:57:48,600
The teach musicians how to do that.
Yeah.

2929
01:57:49,050 --> 01:57:49,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

2930
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:52,520
And I promise you they are not trick
foreclose those now.

2931
01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:54,030
Nails not trick forks.
They are.

2932
01:57:54,090 --> 01:57:55,230
Yeah.
Well,

2933
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:57,690
just the fact that you could spin a
regular fork,

2934
01:57:57,691 --> 01:57:59,460
right this.
Well fuck.

2935
01:57:59,461 --> 01:58:00,900
Are you doing that man?
There was a way.

2936
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:05,250
It sort of became the holy grail for me
when I can tell you how that came about

2937
01:58:05,251 --> 01:58:07,080
for me.
There was muscle walkie Kyoto I told you

2938
01:58:07,081 --> 01:58:09,690
that he could actually put it under a
chair and he would put it in something

2939
01:58:09,691 --> 01:58:13,500
and twists that I was doing an article
for the national enquirer.

2940
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:15,650
I don't even think I could do that with
just my hands.

2941
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,430
What's confused?
And a guy shows up.

2942
01:58:17,431 --> 01:58:17,941
You.
Yeah,

2943
01:58:17,941 --> 01:58:19,710
there was a way.
And the guy shows up,

2944
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:22,440
a photographer shows up for me and he
said,

2945
01:58:22,441 --> 01:58:24,310
I want you to bend some silverware so
you know,

2946
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:25,111
I,
I go,

2947
01:58:25,111 --> 01:58:25,531
oh,
you know,

2948
01:58:25,531 --> 01:58:27,030
and I,
you know,

2949
01:58:27,031 --> 01:58:27,960
I go to him,
you know,

2950
01:58:27,961 --> 01:58:28,591
and I go,
okay,

2951
01:58:28,591 --> 01:58:29,910
all right,
I'm going to bend something.

2952
01:58:29,911 --> 01:58:33,000
So I take one and I go like this and
next thing you know,

2953
01:58:33,001 --> 01:58:36,390
it's bending up like that.
And then I do another band for him.

2954
01:58:36,391 --> 01:58:37,530
He says,
this is going to take a while,

2955
01:58:37,531 --> 01:58:38,670
isn't it?
I go,

2956
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:39,840
yeah.
He says,

2957
01:58:39,870 --> 01:58:40,950
just bend them up with your hand.
It's like,

2958
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:41,883
well that's cheating,

2959
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:43,450
which exactly what I was doing,
you know,

2960
01:58:43,451 --> 01:58:45,250
so I would say that said to cheating.
So he says,

2961
01:58:45,251 --> 01:58:46,840
now go ahead.
So I just start bending them up like

2962
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:48,220
crazy crazy.
And next thing you know,

2963
01:58:48,221 --> 01:58:51,760
I had a twist and I remember exactly how
I got that twist.

2964
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:55,780
So I called Randy up on the phone
because it was sort of the holy grail

2965
01:58:55,781 --> 01:58:57,460
thing,
looking for a way to actually do it.

2966
01:58:57,461 --> 01:58:59,760
And I went in there and have one of
those telephones.

2967
01:58:59,761 --> 01:59:00,970
I had the long cord,
you know,

2968
01:59:00,971 --> 01:59:03,410
all the way to the bathroom.
And I called Randy and I'm whispering

2969
01:59:03,411 --> 01:59:03,971
now and say,
Hey,

2970
01:59:03,971 --> 01:59:05,420
I just spent a fortune,
you know,

2971
01:59:05,490 --> 01:59:07,300
with my hands and I'll put a twist in
it.

2972
01:59:07,301 --> 01:59:08,051
And he goes,
yeah,

2973
01:59:08,051 --> 01:59:08,990
so what?
I go,

2974
01:59:08,991 --> 01:59:09,200
no,
no,

2975
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:11,740
no.
And I explained exactly how to do it.

2976
01:59:11,741 --> 01:59:14,020
Now all the mentalist used that
technique.

2977
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:16,750
Yeah.
So this was a regular fork?

2978
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:18,490
Yes.
And you twisted that right in front of

2979
01:59:18,491 --> 01:59:19,560
my face with one hand.

2980
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:22,013
Hm.

2981
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:24,310
Oh,
how the fuck he did it.

2982
01:59:24,370 --> 01:59:26,500
He not supposed to know he was supposed
to enjoy the mystery,

2983
01:59:26,501 --> 01:59:27,130
Joe.
Right.

2984
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:27,861
Well,
I'm trying.

2985
01:59:27,861 --> 01:59:31,090
I know that you can be fooled.
It's very confusing that I could be

2986
01:59:31,091 --> 01:59:33,190
fooled so easily because this is a real
fork.

2987
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:37,480
I know that there's a certain forks that
they make out a shitty metal.

2988
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:40,990
It's like a nice heat it up and it
becomes like Super Bendy.

2989
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:43,150
Yeah.
That's something that's.

2990
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:45,940
I don't want to get too much into
methods and so forth,

2991
01:59:45,941 --> 01:59:48,310
but that's definitely not something I
use or would use.

2992
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:50,140
Yeah,
and that looks just a little weird it

2993
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:53,590
jerking off,
but I'm trying to get a dental monic

2994
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:58,000
ejaculation that may or may not do it.
The thing about was weird is that how

2995
01:59:58,001 --> 02:00:01,660
easy that fork bent when I bend it when
you had it,

2996
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:05,320
it was very strange.
The one that bent really easy when I

2997
02:00:05,321 --> 02:00:06,290
bend it and he said,
Oh,

2998
02:00:06,291 --> 02:00:08,860
you're doing it on your own.
It was so easy to bend,

2999
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:09,790
right?
Like why would it.

3000
02:00:09,810 --> 02:00:12,760
Why was it so easy to bend now?
I'm can't tell you why at that moment.

3001
02:00:13,230 --> 02:00:14,063
Hmm.

3002
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:17,930
That if you look now,
that's that fork right there and take a

3003
02:00:17,931 --> 02:00:20,860
look at it and see if it's easy to bend.
Now you'll see that it's not a heat in

3004
02:00:20,861 --> 02:00:21,681
this.
Fuck her up.

3005
02:00:21,681 --> 02:00:24,020
I'm going to make it easy to,
but it's because at that moment that's

3006
02:00:24,021 --> 02:00:26,270
the one that I was going to break.
I wanted to break that one.

3007
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:30,140
It's very confused and it's a job.
Well,

3008
02:00:30,141 --> 02:00:31,660
it's amazing really,
because it.

3009
02:00:31,661 --> 02:00:35,690
You'll let people actually touch the
things and someone like me who knows

3010
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:38,780
that you're doing a trick because you
told me that you're doing a trick and

3011
02:00:38,781 --> 02:00:41,390
yet I still can't figure out how the
fuck can you see me work.

3012
02:00:41,391 --> 02:00:43,910
You'll see I throw everything across the
stage and a lot of stuff.

3013
02:00:43,911 --> 02:00:46,630
I just leave for people afterwards
because I want them to interact with

3014
02:00:46,631 --> 02:00:48,360
those things.
I want them to take them home with.

3015
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
No,
I can imagine.

3016
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:51,550
Especially the forks.
Yeah.

3017
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:53,390
After awhile,
you know,

3018
02:00:54,470 --> 02:00:56,690
that's just.
He just sat.

3019
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:58,550
I mean,
you just sit and look at this fork

3020
02:00:58,551 --> 02:00:59,181
afterwards.
You're like,

3021
02:00:59,181 --> 02:01:01,160
okay,
I don't think I could do that.

3022
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,770
Yeah.
I mean if I just gave you a regular

3023
02:01:03,771 --> 02:01:04,321
fork,
Jane,

3024
02:01:04,321 --> 02:01:06,020
when you think you can do that,
spin that.

3025
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:08,180
No,
I don't think I could twist that thing

3026
02:01:08,181 --> 02:01:10,940
like that.
Remember we were talking about the TV

3027
02:01:10,941 --> 02:01:12,920
show.
We were talking about the TV show

3028
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:16,730
earlier is I have a pitch.
It's out right now for a series which it

3029
02:01:16,731 --> 02:01:19,160
looks like it may be going somewhere so
I don't wanna say too much about it,

3030
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:23,000
but it's bringing back the million
dollar challenge and it's going out to

3031
02:01:23,001 --> 02:01:25,880
James James,
Randy million dollar challenge and it's

3032
02:01:25,881 --> 02:01:29,030
to go out looking for psychics,
testing them under proper controls.

3033
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:31,880
If they're trying to trick us,
maybe I'll expose their methods.

3034
02:01:32,210 --> 02:01:37,210
I will demonstrate my abilities
supposedly to do the exact same thing

3035
02:01:37,611 --> 02:01:41,990
under certain conditions as and it's
sort of what makes me the expert to go

3036
02:01:41,991 --> 02:01:44,930
out and try to find these things and see
what's really going on and it's sort of

3037
02:01:44,970 --> 02:01:48,260
a brain games meets,
meets the bunking meet psychic

3038
02:01:48,261 --> 02:01:50,060
phenomena,
but not every single one is going to be

3039
02:01:50,061 --> 02:01:52,310
debunking either.
It's only going to be really debunking

3040
02:01:52,311 --> 02:01:55,610
when somebody is purposefully going out
and trying to bullshit somebody in

3041
02:01:55,611 --> 02:01:57,800
trying to fool people will take
advantage of people.

3042
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:03,700
It's very baffling stuff,
but the stuff about talking to be bold

3043
02:02:04,281 --> 02:02:07,190
and ask them questions and reading their
cues.

3044
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:10,170
That kind of makes sense,
but this doesn't make sense at all.

3045
02:02:10,210 --> 02:02:13,640
Fork stuff just does not make sense.
It's really weird because the PK stuff

3046
02:02:13,641 --> 02:02:16,160
is something as a mentalist,
as a performer,

3047
02:02:16,161 --> 02:02:17,570
you tend to pick your powers,
right?

3048
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:20,780
You tend to.
Well you wouldn't because you're not as

3049
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:22,880
performance ourselves.
When we performed this type of stuff,

3050
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:23,901
we go,
okay,

3051
02:02:23,901 --> 02:02:26,600
does that fit sort of in the repertoire
of my abilities?

3052
02:02:26,601 --> 02:02:28,010
Do I have x Ray Vision?
You know,

3053
02:02:28,011 --> 02:02:30,860
I drive cars blindfolded,
you know dough in there,

3054
02:02:30,861 --> 02:02:33,320
they put tape over,
they see me do something along those

3055
02:02:33,321 --> 02:02:38,270
lines on your show and it's this thing
of like you pick your abilities and this

3056
02:02:38,271 --> 02:02:42,650
doesn't seem to fit with anything except
that your yellow did do this and also

3057
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:45,980
said that he could duplicate pictures
and read minds once in a while as well.

3058
02:02:45,981 --> 02:02:47,390
I didn't do too much of the mind
reading,

3059
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:49,700
but did a little bit of it.
Somebody would draw a picture,

3060
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:52,010
then he would draw a picture and they
would match.

3061
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:54,920
So which is a standard mentalism magic
trick anyway,

3062
02:02:55,070 --> 02:02:56,960
but his method is will a little bit more
bold.

3063
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,670
A little bit more direct.
Hm.

3064
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,150
Yeah.
I'm still baffled.

3065
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:05,930
Stopped being baffled.
How could I not be bent some forks?

3066
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:07,760
Maybe.
Maybe someday I'll teach you how to do

3067
02:03:07,761 --> 02:03:10,160
all this and I'll tell everybody know
that I want that.

3068
02:03:10,161 --> 02:03:11,520
I want to tell you,
don't tell them that again.

3069
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:13,820
Tell you you can't tell me.
I'll fucking tell everybody

3070
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:17,960
then nobody's going to be impressed when
you do it.

3071
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:19,090
Well,
I don't care.

3072
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:23,540
I just want everybody to know.
Is there anything else that you could do

3073
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:24,770
that's fucked up?
Uh,

3074
02:03:24,771 --> 02:03:27,080
I didn't really bring a whole lot
because I've kind of just wanted to talk

3075
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:29,390
more than anything else.
I mean,

3076
02:03:29,391 --> 02:03:30,800
what you've done as well.
It's very,

3077
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:33,920
very impressive.
Maybe I can do one thing for you.

3078
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:34,873
Okay.

3079
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:39,950
Alright.
So see these.

3080
02:03:39,951 --> 02:03:40,784
You know what they are,
right?

3081
02:03:41,150 --> 02:03:43,580
No.
The zener cards.

3082
02:03:43,610 --> 02:03:47,390
Basically seeing the shapes,
basically five shapes that were,

3083
02:03:47,740 --> 02:03:51,170
um,
that were used at Stanford Research

3084
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:52,250
Institute.
I Duke University,

3085
02:03:52,251 --> 02:03:54,830
actually not Stanford.
Duke University either created by

3086
02:03:54,890 --> 02:03:57,590
causing her a simple shapes.
There's a square,

3087
02:03:57,591 --> 02:03:59,690
there's a star wavy lines plus in a
circle.

3088
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:01,580
All right.
These are the standard shapes right

3089
02:04:01,581 --> 02:04:04,550
there.
I'm going to try to get you to choose a

3090
02:04:04,551 --> 02:04:05,720
specific one.
Now,

3091
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:07,460
psychologically,
if I asked you to choose one,

3092
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:09,610
which would you say like,
I mean,

3093
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:12,800
would you even say psychological?
The wavy lines that will be

3094
02:04:12,801 --> 02:04:14,540
psychological because it's right in the
middle.

3095
02:04:14,541 --> 02:04:15,620
And that would be the one.
All right,

3096
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:18,900
so I'm going to go with um,
yeah,

3097
02:04:18,901 --> 02:04:21,020
I'm going to go with a star.
I think star,

3098
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:22,700
there's a circle.
There's a square.

3099
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:24,860
Uh,
the plus and the wavy lines are.

3100
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:26,660
I'm going to mix them up so you don't
know which is which.

3101
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:29,870
I'm going to have to look at them in
just a second myself to make sure I know

3102
02:04:29,871 --> 02:04:32,600
exactly where that is.
All right.

3103
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,210
We can do this as the gambling thing or
not,

3104
02:04:35,211 --> 02:04:40,211
but I don't like to do that.
She'd probably rip people off strong.

3105
02:04:40,291 --> 02:04:41,880
I to put that in the right place.
Okay,

3106
02:04:41,881 --> 02:04:43,620
good.
So this is what we're going to do.

3107
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:45,150
I'm going to take cards and I'm going to
ask you,

3108
02:04:45,151 --> 02:04:49,740
do you think the star is that card you?
All you have to do is not choose a star.

3109
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:51,051
You're gonna.
Choose a star.

3110
02:04:51,051 --> 02:04:54,480
You won't know why you choose a star,
but you will choose the star.

3111
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:55,420
All right?
You,

3112
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:57,240
you won't have a.
He just will.

3113
02:04:57,820 --> 02:05:00,300
And it's gonna be something I do
something I say or something that it's

3114
02:05:00,301 --> 02:05:03,520
going to be something that I'm going to
try to make me pick the story.

3115
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:05,070
This may or may not work,
right?

3116
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:07,620
But snaky.
Pastor,

3117
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:10,530
do you think this is?
Do you think I'm going to say yes,

3118
02:05:10,531 --> 02:05:12,030
that's the star you say?
Yes,

3119
02:05:12,031 --> 02:05:13,350
that's a star uses.
Okay.

3120
02:05:13,351 --> 02:05:17,100
So you're supposed to say no,
that's not the star at some point

3121
02:05:17,101 --> 02:05:19,260
because your idea is not to pick the
star.

3122
02:05:19,261 --> 02:05:21,060
I want you to not pick this up to
anyone.

3123
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:24,540
So if you think that's the star right,
I will.

3124
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,310
Okay.
So you're just gonna say,

3125
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:28,170
do you understand?
Yes.

3126
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:29,053
All right,
so here we go.

3127
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:30,240
I know you're watching me close.
All right,

3128
02:05:30,241 --> 02:05:32,050
so let's do it again.
Hold already.

3129
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:33,960
Flipped him around.
He makes them up one more time.

3130
02:05:33,990 --> 02:05:36,840
There's this sneaky hand movements are
so confusing.

3131
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:37,711
Watch.
Okay.

3132
02:05:37,711 --> 02:05:38,490
No sleep.
Tamar,

3133
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:40,770
which makes me sad.
These spent so much time learning how to

3134
02:05:40,771 --> 02:05:45,771
move your hands like this.
So I'm going to keep it simple.

3135
02:05:46,030 --> 02:05:48,450
Really simple for you.
My opinion.

3136
02:05:48,510 --> 02:05:49,650
Yeah.
Well I've cut it already.

3137
02:05:49,651 --> 02:05:51,430
So because I want to do it again because
I want to make,

3138
02:05:51,490 --> 02:05:52,323
make it very,
very hard.

3139
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:55,430
If your job is to not choose the star,
right?

3140
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:56,760
Okay.
Not Choose a star.

3141
02:05:57,180 --> 02:05:57,960
Ready.
All right.

3142
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,800
So,
um,

3143
02:06:00,030 --> 02:06:01,770
I guess I'll just ask you,
do you want this card?

3144
02:06:01,970 --> 02:06:03,510
No.
All right.

3145
02:06:03,511 --> 02:06:05,220
So you don't want that one.
Don't want that one.

3146
02:06:06,450 --> 02:06:07,283
Do you want that card?

3147
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:12,570
Don't choose a star.
Yes,

3148
02:06:12,571 --> 02:06:13,890
I want that one.
You sure?

3149
02:06:13,891 --> 02:06:15,300
That's the one you want.
That's the one I want

3150
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:18,000
the look.
Okay.

3151
02:06:18,001 --> 02:06:18,750
I want to look there.
Look,

3152
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:20,170
I don't trust you.
Watch my hand.

3153
02:06:20,171 --> 02:06:22,710
Don't look.
Don't look and see what you didn't

3154
02:06:22,711 --> 02:06:24,030
choose.
You didn't choose a circle.

3155
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:27,630
She was a plastic,
didn't choose the wavy lines or the

3156
02:06:27,631 --> 02:06:28,860
square.
He chose a star.

3157
02:06:29,190 --> 02:06:33,510
They look
out of a bitch.

3158
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:35,130
Yeah.
Yeah,

3159
02:06:35,131 --> 02:06:36,390
but that's like sleight of hand,
right?

3160
02:06:36,570 --> 02:06:37,820
Huh?
Huh?

3161
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:38,370
Well,
what?

3162
02:06:38,370 --> 02:06:40,410
What the hell is that what you're
talking about?

3163
02:06:40,411 --> 02:06:41,890
Which sleight of hand.
I try.

3164
02:06:42,460 --> 02:06:44,670
I try it one more time.
Who knows?

3165
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:45,863
Okay.

3166
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:49,890
To put in there.
All right.

3167
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:53,670
I hate doing this stuff like this
because especially with the amount of

3168
02:06:53,671 --> 02:06:55,320
people that are listening to this
podcast,

3169
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:57,560
what happens?
Don't know about wrong.

3170
02:06:58,170 --> 02:06:59,280
If I'm wrong,
I looked like an idiot.

3171
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:01,700
If you're raw performance.
Yeah.

3172
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:03,900
Somehow or another.
I think you're not going to be wrong.

3173
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:05,370
I could be.
So once again,

3174
02:07:05,730 --> 02:07:07,110
I'm going to try and make you choose a
star.

3175
02:07:07,510 --> 02:07:09,360
Okay.
Your job is to not use it.

3176
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:10,120
Okay.
I'm not gonna.

3177
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:11,540
Do it again after this.
This is the last time.

3178
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:14,880
Do you want that card?
Yes.

3179
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:19,640
That's the one you want.
That's the one I want to keep in mind.

3180
02:07:19,641 --> 02:07:22,160
You did that the first time.
Yeah,

3181
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:23,840
right.
Don't look,

3182
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:28,760
don't look square.
Circle plus wavy lines.

3183
02:07:28,761 --> 02:07:29,594
Stick.
Look.

3184
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:33,800
Dammit.
Start.

3185
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:38,410
Now.
Do you realize that I'm impulsive and

3186
02:07:38,411 --> 02:07:42,070
then I have no patience for the star
immediately.

3187
02:07:42,120 --> 02:07:45,670
He did it the first time.
So you thought that by doing it again,

3188
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:48,580
that I would not think that you would do
it a second time.

3189
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:51,040
Is that what you did?
Does that sort of kind of.

3190
02:07:51,041 --> 02:07:55,000
Not what I did
not going to tell us so that he's

3191
02:07:55,001 --> 02:07:56,050
getting frustrated,
right?

3192
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:56,950
No,
no,

3193
02:07:56,950 --> 02:07:57,820
no.
I'm very impressed.

3194
02:07:57,821 --> 02:07:59,530
I'm very impressed.
Well listen man,

3195
02:08:00,070 --> 02:08:01,390
this was a lot of fun.
It was fun.

3196
02:08:01,450 --> 02:08:03,790
I enjoyed it.
Thanks again for doing the TV show.

3197
02:08:03,791 --> 02:08:05,860
That was a lot of fun too.
And anytime.

3198
02:08:05,861 --> 02:08:08,890
And thanks for being so well you've done
it.

3199
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:13,540
You've cleverly navigated the waters
being so honest about it being tricks

3200
02:08:13,570 --> 02:08:16,990
without revealing the tricks and then
even doing them in front of me,

3201
02:08:16,991 --> 02:08:19,270
which is incredibly impressive.
This fourth thing,

3202
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:21,370
I don't know what to say.
Uh,

3203
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:22,670
I don't know what to tell you.
Thank you.

3204
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:23,860
This was fun.
I enjoyed it.

3205
02:08:23,861 --> 02:08:27,730
I really appreciate it for everything.
But everything you do and your website

3206
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:30,070
is [inaudible] dot com.
[inaudible] DOT com,

3207
02:08:30,071 --> 02:08:33,610
b a c h e dot k.
and people can find out all your tour

3208
02:08:33,611 --> 02:08:35,040
dates,
the dates,

3209
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:36,820
everything,
and you got to see this in real life

3210
02:08:36,821 --> 02:08:37,960
folks.
It's going to fuck you up.

3211
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:39,760
Thank you sir.
Appreciate it,

3212
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:40,000
man.
