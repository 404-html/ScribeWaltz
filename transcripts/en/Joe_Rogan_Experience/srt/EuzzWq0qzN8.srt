1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:01,970
That was,

3
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,481
by the way,

4
00:00:02,481 --> 00:00:04,700
it was in a six and a half minute workout.

5
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:04,851
Oh,

6
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:05,750
here comes Brian.

7
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,490
You must know where online now.

8
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,353
Six and a half.

9
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,890
Do this online lifting.

10
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,123
All right.

11
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,830
Hey little fella.

12
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,800
Oops.

13
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,520
Here we go.

14
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,390
Hey little fella.

15
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,520
We're on the air right now.

16
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,271
Well,

17
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:23,104
you're sleeping.

18
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,983
How dare you.

19
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:26,471
I'm,

20
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,360
I'm in a panic because I can't get,

21
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,141
I guess it doesn't matter,

22
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:33,250
but I can't get that dissolve thing to
work where you can't see the text at the

23
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:34,084
bottom of the screen.

24
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,391
Yeah.

25
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:40,280
You know how you can
make the tax fade out.

26
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,660
How do I do that?

27
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,100
Should I sing background
music while he did his?

28
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,943
Yeah,

29
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,970
his name Ma'am.

30
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,153
Okay,

31
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,030
and right click on a scene that you're on.

32
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,893
Okay.

33
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,603
To

34
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,913
edit shot.

35
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,790
It's a really nice contrast.

36
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,220
It's got a wide face,

37
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,530
Exxon,

38
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,970
it lod phase,

39
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:07,801
lag chairs,

40
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,780
so on and costly.

41
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,790
I don't see that.

42
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:11,830
That's where it's confusing.

43
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,900
She's too,

44
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,201
he's no,

45
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:15,511
I have the,

46
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,341
it's just you.

47
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:18,920
I was trying to put Brian's name
up because it's your name on it.

48
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,070
He's got shoulders for
days and a really wide

49
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,933
shoulders.

50
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,080
So what should I do?

51
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,780
The last one is Christina [inaudible]
and it's got like a names on it.

52
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,021
Oh,

53
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:35,340
the last thing on the far right.

54
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,691
Nia.

55
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:37,980
That one's just me now

56
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,040
and now that's just Brian.

57
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,341
Oh,

58
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,230
I could go back and
forth from Brian to me.

59
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,471
Oh,

60
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:47,610
be sexy.

61
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,580
Yes.

62
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:49,960
Do you like my background?

63
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,180
[inaudible] sound on those.

64
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,410
Oh,

65
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,741
okay.

66
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,010
So I should stick with what I'm on.

67
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,370
Thank you for sharing with
us in this technical break.

68
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:56,941
Ladies and gentlemen,

69
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm going to keep singing
the song about Joe Rogan.

70
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,220
He's got a,

71
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,670
Whoa,

72
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,230
okay,

73
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,120
well we'll have to deal with this,

74
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,900
but on the,

75
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,561
so the,

76
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:04,890
um,

77
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,401
the text,

78
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:07,440
there's no way to get rid
of that text on the screen.

79
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,773
Simple.

80
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,170
He's got a wife and he's really flexible.

81
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:14,070
His name is Joe Rogan.

82
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,400
He's got a watch face and
neck wad face on a short neck.

83
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,661
See,

84
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:21,770
I don't see that though.

85
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,060
When I'm trying to do that.

86
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,690
I can't,

87
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,860
it's not letting me do that means
he can absorb punches really well.

88
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,170
Should have been a fighter buddies,

89
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,220
ladies and gentlemen home.

90
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,210
This is boring as fuck.

91
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:34,220
I'm sure I'm singing now.

92
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,250
That shows logic,

93
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:36,420
camera logic,

94
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,340
camera built in eyesight.

95
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,330
Those are the options.

96
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,130
I'm singing background music.

97
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:43,170
Did builtin input.

98
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:43,620
Uh,

99
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,640
it shouldn't be anything on,

100
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,680
it should have been a gymnast.

101
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:47,330
He should have been in,

102
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,950
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing,

103
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,170
dude.

104
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,340
We're going to have to have you.

105
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,193
Uh,

106
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,680
this is a good job.

107
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,514
Security for you.

108
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,760
The whole of the whole show
goes to shit without red band.

109
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,783
Okay.

110
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:01,901
All right.

111
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:04,090
Well now for some reason
it says Eddie Bravo.

112
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,110
I must have changed it.

113
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,310
I don't mind being Eddie Bravo.

114
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:06,701
Okay.

115
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,570
This is Eddie Bravo.

116
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,410
Now they used to,

117
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:08,561
well,

118
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,120
we'll just give him plugs to our friends.

119
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,300
I'll be at the American that comedy.

120
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,761
Oh yeah.

121
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,560
Let me check.

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,250

123
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,250

124
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,250
Saturday,

125
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,251

126
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,084

Saturday.

130
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,400
I should turn up my volume.

131
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,730
Are you,

132
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,760
what is he talking about?

133
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,290
Go,

134
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,070
I'm just getting,

135
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,530
I'm just,

136
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,363
uh,

137
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,700
I'm talking to Brian Cowen.

138
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,900
He's talking on the podcast.

139
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,330
The same songs about you name is
gill rogue and he's got a lot better.

140
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:37,630
We're just trying to see if
this thing is actually online.

141
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,790
It's kind of long eye lashes
and he's really flexible.

142
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,320
He can do impressions.

143
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,670
Nobody knows that.

144
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,580
Here's Joe Rural Gum is really muscular.

145
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,850
Got a wide face,

146
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,760
wide face,

147
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:53,920
Santa Short neck,

148
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:58,921
which means he can take a punch to
his fucking knows better than you can.

149
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,930
His name was Joe Rogan.

150
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,760
Joe.

151
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,610
Oh God.

152
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,990

153
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,281

154
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:06,551
Hang on.

155
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,870
I'm trying to come up with other words.

156
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:08,571
Oh yeah.

157
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:08,840
Okay.

158
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,673
It's working.

159
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,601
It's working.

160
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:11,434
All right,

161
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,760
I'll see you all tomorrow,

162
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,091
Jamie.

163
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:14,140
Kilstein later.

164
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,123
Bye.

165
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,581
So,

166
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:15,850
uh,

167
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,600
we'll have that soon.

168
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,140
All right.

169
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,371
And I'm,

170
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:18,340
and I'm going to record the,

171
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:18,850
uh,

172
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,470
the Joe Rogan a soundtrack
to it in the back

173
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,430
to all roll gum.

174
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,833
What's the sound?

175
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:28,571
