1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
I'd get out of Orange County,
the fucking road warrior again when they

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:04,620
killed everybody,
there'll be fucking crazy.

3
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:06,890
You don't want to be here.
You want to be in the mountains in

4
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:10,730
Montana,
Colorado anymore.

5
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:15,600
It's too many fucking momos and fucking
money came into fake fucking money and

6
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:19,220
bought the hillbillies out the real
motherfuckers that you needed it because

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,270
in case she got to go like Woody Creek
to find those people.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,670
Right?
Know Woody Creek.

9
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:25,890
Is that still fucking amateurs?
Really?

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,130
Once you're fucking booze is up there,
you got to go deep,

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,530
deep in the mountains of gunnison and
shit like that.

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,263
Funny.
Those credits.

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,710
Gunnison.
Brian,

14
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:37,500
you got your volume.
We're echoing garland.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,210
Gunderson.
Gunderson.

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,980
Where's that?
That's down south.

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,410
What do you think about all that shit
about the Denver airport?

18
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,000
Do you know anything about the
conspiracy behind the Denver airport is

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,790
the Denver airport.
First of all,

20
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,820
they moved away more dirt than it needed
to and so there's this.

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,320
All this thought that there's some sort
of subterranean tunnel tunnel system and

22
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,480
it's all based on the end of the world.
Shelters.

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,910
They fucked up Stapleton airport was a
brilliant.

24
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:01,050
That's what it was like.
Burbank.

25
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,250
You could smuggle a fucking dead fucking
kilos of coke and nobody said nothing

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,890
and all of a sudden they came up with a
bright idea.

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,060
Let's fucking make an airport 90 miles
farther out by Kansas.

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,670
Someone it snows.
We really get fucking buried.

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,090
We have no protection.
That's a bunch of cowboys role making

30
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,970
decisions and trust me,
they're too stupid to even know the

31
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,100
conspiracy theory is that people that
built it maybe.

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,330
But if the government was really truly
behind it,

33
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:30,870
like all these people think what it is
that they made an airport there.

34
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,470
But in constructing the airport they
also built some sort of underground

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,460
safeguard three stairs.
So there's gotta be some Kinky Shit.

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,080
Well you know,
if it's close,

37
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,250
I mean that would be a move,
right?

38
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,740
Nora in airport and then build some
shelters.

39
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,290
That airport is like fucking Kansas,
Kansas during dick out there.

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,130
That's what they call it.
The.

41
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,130
If it was easy man,
when I lived in Denver or in Boulder,

42
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,080
there was easy to drive there.
Drive fucking hour.

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,510
Nothing.
Never any traffic to be 25 minutes.

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,650
Here's the deal though,
bro.

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,480
There's no traffic on that.
Don't matter.

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,090
Used to be 25 minutes with no traffic.
Tunes crack the window a bit.

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,730
They built this monster to spend money.
They built this bond,

48
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,920
this monster to to,
to just,

49
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,660
you know,
like when I went to fucking newark to

50
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,790
see the fights with you did,
we did it.

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,210
They built the soccer stadium,
soccer stadium in Newark.

52
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,970
That's spending money left and right,
but they still can't put it on the left

53
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:22,890
hand turning signal.

54
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,170
So if you got to make a left 29 fucking
miles and people trying to keep up the

55
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:31,560
reputation as the car jack capital of
the world and if you've got some left

56
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:33,150
turn signals,
you get some outlet.

57
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,230
People can escape,
can escape the drama.

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,090
Fucking amazing.
That's the thing about that.

59
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:39,940
It's like,
you know,

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,960
they think that there's something really
going on inside that Denver airport.

61
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:46,290
There's all these documentaries.
I'm dedicated to it and one of the

62
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:51,291
reasons for it is because there's these
crazy murals that were painted up in the

63
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,090
Denver airport and they're really
disturbing man.

64
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,270
Their apocalyptic like one guy's gonna
fucking gas mask on with a giant and

65
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,000
there's pictures of children and coffins
and there's fire in the background.

66
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,070
Have you ever seen that shit?
Yeah,

67
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,640
but yeah.
We've actually talked about on this

68
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,670
podcast before,
but do you think that has anything to do

69
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,080
with,
with that?

70
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,770
I think putting the two together,
I don't think that it does definitely,

71
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:16,540
but it's interesting,
you know,

72
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,160
I mean,
I don't have opinion one way or another.

73
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:23,161
I've listened to the people talk about
how it's some great escape base in 2012

74
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:27,210
there's going to be fucking asteroid's
gonna hit that.

75
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,290
They're tracking.
It's going to kill everybody except the

76
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,580
people that are in this underground
bunker.

77
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,870
I don't know,
man.

78
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,650
I watched the TV show and those dudes,
those dudes that have,

79
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:35,320
uh,
they've,

80
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,060
they've bought like fucking condos out
in these shelters out in like death

81
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:42,970
valley and Shit.
Have you seen those people have space in

82
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:46,630
death valley and so they have like a
condo inside this underground bunker

83
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:46,810
thing.

84
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,700
It's out in the middle of fucking
nowhere.

85
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,270
You have to drive and you go out there
and they had these shows,

86
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,140
I forget who was the host of the show,
but they.

87
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,220
They took you on a tour of these fucking
but might've been Jesse Ventura.

88
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,810
No,
it wasn't him because they had a sense

89
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:01,510
of humor,
but whoever it was was like really?

90
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,530
And that they take on his fucking tour
of these underground bunkers that they

91
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:08,500
have set up where they can survive a
fucking nuclear bomb.

92
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,200
I mean,
these guys are like half a mile deep

93
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:11,970
into the fucking earth.

94
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,930
So you survived the bump now which you
and eight fucking assholes.

95
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,460
Just listen.
Just live your fucking life.

96
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,090
These people that dig into that Shit and
just live your fucking life.

97
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,840
You will get hit by a bomb.
The best thing you could do is move on

98
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:26,950
to the fucking next life and pray to
God.

99
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,130
It'll be fucking better doors.
Music.

100
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,630
What the fuck is wrong with me?
I'm going to live in a bucket.

101
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,730
You imagine being living your life
consumer.

102
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:38,240
What happened was a bomb drops after
1960 of those people.

103
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:41,480
That Shit wore off in the sixties.
They all moved into buildings but

104
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,450
underground drops with little fucking
sandwiches.

105
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,410
That's how Tang was fucking invent.
The wedding invented Tang for.

106
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,040
So when we go in that fucking tunnel of
doom and after the Russians thought

107
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,780
everybody in the ass,
we can come out and where we got vitamin

108
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:56,300
C from the [inaudible] Tang,
that's more,

109
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,330
but guess what?
Our fears aren't the Russians anymore.

110
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,400
It's a lot bigger than that and whenever
it's going to hit now,

111
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,340
right now there's a thing going on in
Japan where we don't fucking know.

112
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,350
They align to the people just like
everything else.

113
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,290
They live in a 20 mile radius.
That shit's horrible.

114
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,830
That shit is horrible.
Radiation is fucking horrible and the

115
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,450
best is all these people are raising
their hands up.

116
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,570
We have radiation in key west.
Don't blame it on fucking Japan.

117
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,220
Don't blame it on Japan.
Now.

118
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:21,770
That's not Japan's for you guys.
Fat Radiation on your own.

119
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,470
You Greasy motherfuckers down there off
the coast of Florida,

120
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,220
you filthy cock suckers,
blame on the pool fucking jobs.

121
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:32,210
They're walking around with fucking mask
and as radiation West Florida that's

122
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:37,211
primarily poked up trying guys off and
creating heat sperm that they put in the

123
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:42,140
fucking beach during CSI Miami.
It's got these chicks Brazilian jumping

124
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,540
up and down with that ass.
That's what that fucking is.

125
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,410
Pussy fucking nasty radiation,
but it's something extra dirty about

126
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:51,020
porn that you get from Miami.
You ever watched porn from Miami?

127
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,570
Because it's almost like they're a
retarded people fucking,

128
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,500
you know what I mean?

129
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,700
And they're always oiled up to the oil
drop and does something about it.

130
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:02,480
Like you can't relate.
It's hard to even jerk off Joe Rogan

131
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,900
Mundo Martians and lifting one on one to
fucking trouble trouble.

132
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,190
This thing in Japan is a lot worse than
what they're saying.

133
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,420
You think so?
Fuck yeah.

134
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,240
What makes you say this?
Just I just know our society and they

135
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,630
don't want to scare us.
Which little fucking Japanese started

136
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,430
coming out with six fucking eyes and she
don't know which one's looking at you.

137
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,470
Then they're going to say,
what is that better?

138
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:19,780
So you can see better.
Maybe.

139
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,850
Maybe that's 2012.
They.

140
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,310
That'll be good.
An adaptive radiation.

141
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,190
This is not.

142
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,800
Was there any animals besides roaches
that are really good with radiation?

143
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,900
Roaches is supposed to be the best at it
right now,

144
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,960
but is that.
Is that even?

145
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,360
Is that even just like a wives' tale?
Someone should do us a favor.

146
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,370
Now we know that the Japan is fucked.
Sandbox.

147
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,240
Cockroaches over there with a Webcam on
it.

148
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,100
Let's see what if you love America.
I go over there and do that stupid

149
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,500
fucking water.
All that soil and they don't know what

150
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:52,500
the fuck's going on and you know what?
Now besides that,

151
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:55,230
we're all spread out where we live.
We're in this fucking place.

152
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,750
What the fuck
are you?

153
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,950
Fucking crazy.
These guys are just sitting there

154
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,803
waiting.
It's like a.

155
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,300
it's like a.
you're just waiting for us to wear out

156
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,840
before you fucked us in there.
What's that guy we'd been looking for

157
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:09,090
for 11 years?
He's just sitting there going,

158
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:09,701
oh,
we got them.

159
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:14,220
Now it's spread out like motherfuckers
would just light a fire in Kansas,

160
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,300
CNN,
breaking news.

161
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:18,670
I get CNN breaking news sent to my
phone,

162
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,700
Hala US intelligence source.
CIA is operating inside Libya to help us

163
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:30,181
increase military and political
understanding what that means to get

164
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:36,691
Jack Bitch whore ship quote is that,
oh,

165
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,970
the CIA is there to increase military
and political understanding.

166
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,580
No,
this is what we want you to do.

167
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:45,760
Do you understand?
Okay,

168
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:48,250
here's the political understanding.
We got the bombs,

169
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:48,911
bitch.
Okay,

170
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:52,450
we got fucking robots that we can
operate from Nevada.

171
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,100
Okay,
and you don't even see them because they

172
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:57,220
blend in with the sky and they don't
make any noise because they're fucking

173
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:01,000
solar powered and they can contain how
fire missiles.

174
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,040
Hell fire.
That's what I decided to name him.

175
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,210
Not you know the,
the,

176
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:08,140
the beautiful flower missile or lick my
ass all muscle.

177
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:10,480
No.
Hell Fire Hellfire missiles and they're

178
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:12,580
shooting them from another fucking part
of the world.

179
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,050
Imagine a lag they have.
They must have to really plan in advance

180
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,630
like it's just like playing quake online
when you got lag,

181
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:23,110
if you have a 56 k connection and if
some asshole you're planning as it's got

182
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:26,230
a cable modem and you know he gets to
move quicker than you because his

183
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:30,040
downtime is pink time between connecting
to the server and back as much quicker

184
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,870
so you're fucked.
So these guys must have like Super Wag.

185
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,960
August 1985,
we went to see Rambo to have that

186
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:39,620
motherfucker took an hour when the
explosive at the end and when he shot at

187
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,170
all of his last time,
nobody liked the black people.

188
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,010
Black people love that.
Will explosives it.

189
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,580
I seen that movie [inaudible] 78 street.
I'd never seen black people in my life.

190
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:52,450
And Rambo came out of the mother's eyes,
opened up and choked her motherfucking

191
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,380
black people went bananas.
They're like yelling.

192
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,100
We should've thought

193
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,590
of that.
But is it a blonde black dudes that

194
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,870
loved watching martial art?
Love it.

195
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:05,040
They love special.
Like a dude doing some crazy shit.

196
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,640
Like,
oh,

197
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,470
that motherfucker got a gun,
a nice shoe.

198
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,100
Check that shit out.
Something about a dude pulls his shoe

199
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,080
off and guns down the bad guy.
Like,

200
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,080
Oh shit.
No,

201
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,300
he didn't.
What?

202
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:15,670
What is that?
What is it?

203
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,820
We're just very vocal.
They're excited.

204
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,690
The best thing about this is,
that was 20 years ago,

205
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,080
the shit we got now as bombs and stuff
is off the charts.

206
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,860
We've got a bomb that comes at you as a
car that follows you to the gas station

207
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
or you're pumping gas.
It turns into an Obama guy pops on,

208
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:39,040
taps on the shoulder and says goodbye.
That's the shit we got.

209
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,620
We got shit that comes to your house
just to look like a cake.

210
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:43,450
Happy Birthday.
And when you're going to blow out,

211
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:46,450
the candles are just fucking blows up.
We got some shit now.

212
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,080
You know what I saw?
That was really crazy.

213
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:49,670
They got this rover,
this,

214
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:52,340
uh,
this a remote controlled drone rover

215
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,980
that's moving around that can jump in
the air.

216
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,720
It gets up to a fence and I can go like
eight or nine feet in the fucking air.

217
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,520
It moves up to the fence and then it
just goes and flies to the inland the

218
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,950
other side and it looks like basically
it's like,

219
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,460
like some sort of a flat blocks,
you know,

220
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,520
where all the electronics is with two
tractor to rubber tractor things on the

221
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:16,130
side of it I guess,
and the fucking thing flies through the

222
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:17,210
air.
I mean,

223
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,550
what's,
what's next?

224
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,800
You know,
that's the other thing that people are

225
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:23,720
thinking about.
A lot of the shit that's going down in

226
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:25,610
Afghanistan,
a lot of the shit that's going down in

227
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:29,540
the Middle East period as that.
The CIA has got all kinds of shit going

228
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,231
on.
All kinds of,

229
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:32,780
all kinds of little drones and
explosives.

230
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:35,510
It blowing up in convenient spots.
Spark

231
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,960
anger and you know what they do?
That's so they do spark war and get,

232
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,400
you know,
they've always done that.

233
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,740
But the bottom line of this,
what do,

234
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,110
what do you think is really going on?
They figured out some Libyan doctor

235
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,210
figured out a way how to grow 50 kilos
of heroin in your bathtub in the United

236
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,180
States.
Find out that Jack,

237
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,220
that motherfucker Kadafi has got an army
of motherfuckers around this guy with

238
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:58,600
missiles and explosives,
but the United States is jacqueline.

239
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:01,350
This guy's got something to do with age.
It's got something to do with fucking

240
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,300
why we're over there in the fucking
first place.

241
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,640
The whole nucleus of this thing.
People are dying in Detroit from heroin.

242
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,580
It was fucking war and we're still.
Now we're going to take over Libya boxes

243
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,010
or money,
Bro.

244
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,990
Isn't it amazing how many people will
think you're crazy when you start

245
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,210
talking about the fact they're in
Afghanistan for heroin?

246
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,030
People go,
what are you talking about?

247
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,560
They'll look at you like you just
fucking just add dollars,

248
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,240
bowl of shit.
They'll look at you.

249
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,950
Oh,
you're ridiculous person.

250
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,641
Well,
yeah,

251
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:32,690
we're at war for heroin.
Where do you think that money's going,

252
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,690
man?
Where did you know how much money you

253
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:37,400
were talking about?
They can ignore that.

254
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,234
You're fucking great.

255
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,900
We want to take over a country so we can
eat better gyros.

256
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,410
That's what you're telling me.
Stuff we've taking over our country so

257
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:46,190
we can turn it over that fucking loot
dog.

258
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,060
That's the bottom line,
bottom line,

259
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,580
there's all sorts of food over there and
there's all sorts of Luton.

260
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:52,580
Libya too.
I mean it's,

261
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,030
it's,
is it a fucking

262
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,720
coincidence that for whatever reason we
decide to attack Libya instead of going

263
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:02,800
to Mexico and straighten out that
bullshit that's right next door,

264
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,390
but I'll.
Mexico's God's Burritos,

265
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,200
Burritos and hookers and donkeys and
Tequila because there's not a lot of

266
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,220
shit to offer.
Mexicans getting ready though.

267
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,540
But listen,
that's some crazy motherfuckers known

268
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,230
and well,
they got to dig in to clean up their

269
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:15,760
problem.
They've got a big problem and it's

270
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,500
because of the United States.
It's a big part of it.

271
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,790
They wanted to make everything legal.
They wanted to,

272
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,740
you know,
they did.

273
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,290
Do you know that?
Here's a little known fact.

274
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,530
Mexico is decriminalized everything.
Small amounts.

275
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,300
We're not selling it.
Everything's legal now.

276
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:31,450
You could get acid in Mexico,
you can get mushrooms in Mexico.

277
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,900
They decriminalized everything just
because they had to allocate resources

278
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,940
to fight these fucking drug lords.
I mean,

279
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,130
that's a,
that's a country that country's gone.

280
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,320
The country doesn't have a government
anymore lives right next door,

281
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,580
right next door,
right next door,

282
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:45,550
right next door.
The fucking drug army is.

283
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:48,130
It's like going to war with someone who
lives in your country.

284
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,520
It's like if we were fighting al Qaeda,
but al Qaeda had billions of dollars and

285
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,340
it was way more armed and they were
living here.

286
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,860
That's what it's like.
That's what it's like being a fucking

287
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:57,694
comedy.
Mexico.

288
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,040
Here's the crazy thing that Mexico is
coming back to get.

289
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,620
What's this bitch?
California and Texas.

290
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,840
You can't take Texas.
It's not going to tell you.

291
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,970
You can't take care of even the Mexicans
will the go around Texas and Jack

292
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,380
Wyoming Go Jack Dallas,
Dallas to Canada.

293
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,960
Shit.
They'll give them a beat Nigga.

294
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,410
You can tell the outskirts of Texas.
They'll come out of their hunting

295
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:20,660
blinds.
Kill is all here.

296
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,870
He lives there.
Ted nugent lives in Waco now.

297
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,900
Yeah.
You can text.

298
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,680
He does.
He's got a high fence I've always

299
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,330
admired with.
I think he's a retard,

300
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,750
but I think he does a lot of things that
I really agree with and one of the

301
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,790
things that I agree with is when he
lived in Michigan,

302
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,790
he had this bad ass compound.
We'll have 2000 acres or something like

303
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:41,740
that and it was all fenced in and had
all these animals living inside his

304
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,480
compound and he would just go and Jack.
Um,

305
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,040
and that's where he got all his food
from.

306
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,370
He got all his food from hunting on his
own property and I'm like,

307
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,840
God damn it.
That's fucking brilliant.

308
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,790
That's how I want to live.
I would love to live like that.

309
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,940
Just eat what you hunt.
That's one of the reasons why I was into

310
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,070
moving to Colorado.
One of the reasons why I was up there,

311
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:57,731
it was like,
look,

312
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,710
if the shit hits the fan living in the
woods,

313
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,210
you know,
there's a lot of animals out here and

314
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:02,540
it's spring water that comes out to you
and

315
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,750
fucking shooting a pe.
Yeah,

316
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,630
Cook.
I'm gonna fucking cave with your kids.

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,750
A cave.
Just given him all fucking silver.

318
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:12,080
Were living in a tent with fucking
eaters.

319
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,110
If shit ever went down and got Kinky,
can you imagine that Kinky,

320
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,320
Kinky shit gets cranky dog
fuckers.

321
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,170
So I'm excited about Oregon.
Oregon's one of those.

322
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,080
We're going to have a good fucking time.
Oregon's one of those states has been on

323
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:29,090
the grid for years,
but nobody knew about it.

324
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:30,050
They kept it hush.
Hush.

325
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,200
I used to get some good weed Oregon 15
fucking years ago.

326
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,050
Past Ashland.
Eugene bend.

327
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:38,510
Oregon's a hippie and foundation over
there.

328
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,140
Portland is a pretty hippie place too.
It's already hippie girls.

329
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:43,550
Have dirty feet,
dirty feet.

330
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,400
Make them put socks on.
Fox stops and say don't breathe through

331
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:51,860
my mouth.
Portland was the place that uh,

332
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,520
I went to last year and we were at
trying to find the most attractive

333
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,760
person in a costco for like a half hour.
I mean the girl is with.

334
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,320
And who would you fuck?
Yeah.

335
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:03,070
And we couldn't find anyone.
So Costco though,

336
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,090
dude,
go to a costco.

337
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,050
Burbank.
And with a bunch of cripples there too.

338
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:07,070
I know,
but that's a pack.

339
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,710
Tasco.
I usually find one string.

340
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,830
You need to go to better places,
so it was a smaller amount.

341
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,390
Smaller amount of people you'd want to
fuck.

342
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,080
That's okay dude.
You're going to go.

343
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,310
I'll be okay.
I got to live somewhere with this.

344
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,520
If this place falls apart.
I went to the humans here.

345
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,730
Too many.
We keep on saying that,

346
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:29,600
but we're not doing anything about it.
Did I fucking moved man?

347
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,570
The only reason why I came back is
because Mrs Reagan got pregnant and

348
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:35,870
because the dog had eaten by mountain,
might have went to the suburbs.

349
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,000
Then my next move,
we're actually talking about it.

350
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,020
It's not like I'm already talking to
real estate agents.

351
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,620
Oh,
she'll let you talk.

352
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,020
All that nonsense.
The move to move is you'd go and you'd

353
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:53,560
get a summer place and you try it out
and lived there for a summer.

354
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,460
That's right.
It sounds like you'd be super nice while

355
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:57,510
you're there,
so it becomes on the side.

356
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,290
Just every time we were there I'll just
bring home flowers and shit and then we

357
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:05,210
come back to la and then it's all
Jujitsu and loud music and too much pot

358
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:09,290
smoke.
So Ellie's negative daddy crazy in la.

359
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,700
Daddy just wants to fight and smoke pot
and he's walking around naked.

360
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,560
No,
in Colorado.

361
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:19,190
Daddy wants to go get ice cream and
daddy's bringing flowers home.

362
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,110
See you just trained them bro.
This is the problem.

363
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,440
You got fluid farts on her.

364
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,420
I love you to death.
Here's the problem.

365
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:28,900
Joe Rogan's got Joe Rogan's,
got a great wife and Joe Rogan.

366
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:32,530
I went to his home last week and that
was one of the first times that Mrs

367
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,650
Rogan was home and a couple of times and
I'd been up there like four times.

368
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:40,651
Mrs Rogan likes to rock the house.
Dot Real qualm was all where you live

369
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:42,490
now.
All you gotta do is go down the hill and

370
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:45,610
she can get the party started where you
put it before a motherfucker said

371
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:48,970
witness relocation plan.
She had to drive 90 miles before she

372
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:51,520
even seen the dentist who was another 20
miles.

373
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:55,240
She was from all the weapon boulder.
The first mall that she cares about is

374
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:57,130
cherry fucking creek.
You know what I'm saying?

375
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:59,080
So you had a two foods that Denver.
Yeah.

376
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,610
You are too far away from the more you
don't gotta keep a closer to the wall.

377
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,910
You had a 90 fucking miles dog and I
slipped on the love most blew up.

378
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,900
I loved the most living up there and
tell us that there was a

379
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,640
small amount of people,
man,

380
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,510
smaller boulders and only got 100,000
plus people not that much man.

381
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,350
And people are friendly like that.
There's a more relaxed vibe and I think

382
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:24,440
that shit is healthy.
I think there's something exciting about

383
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,780
living in a big city,
especially if you're,

384
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,450
you know,
you're involved in the hustle and bustle

385
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:31,310
and you're really trying to make
something happen.

386
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:33,080
And I don't know.
I

387
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,120
can't believe that New York surrogate,
if you got the voice,

388
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,040
you probably get married and after a
week you dumb fuck you talking a real

389
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,730
estate guy.
Are you talking to a realtor is going to

390
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,690
shut that part of you.
You got to figure out a way to get a

391
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:48,020
fucking call for her to the mall to go
where the action you can do that.

392
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,740
Don't worry about it.
You've got to move a little closer.

393
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,290
That was

394
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,190
too little close and you just need to
move to Texas.

395
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,240
Texas is.
This is the answer to it.

396
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,030
I like Austin.
I'm a big fan of that.

397
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:57,721
Austin,
Texas.

398
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:59,790
I'll tell you that.
I lived there if I was going to live,

399
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,080
but more lane is not legal there.
The thing about Colorado was just like

400
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:06,370
California.
You could just go rockweed everywhere.

401
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,150
I moved to Austin.
No,

402
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,150
no,
not yet.

403
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,530
Not yet.
The shit hits the fan.

404
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:11,520
Anything can happen.
You know,

405
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:12,960
when,
when the shit hits the fan and everybody

406
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,490
gets scared and then you start making,
you know,

407
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,980
survival choices.
You can live in Kansas,

408
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,840
you know,
you'd rather be healthy in Kansas,

409
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,010
you know.
But um,

410
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,020
uh,
the weeds stores in Colorado are just

411
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:22,854
like out here,
Bro.

412
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,380
It's just how they're everywhere.
There's one place in Denver where

413
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:27,030
there's a fucking seven of them on the
street

414
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,540
there.
Every way easier to get a license though

415
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,980
the same.
Same deal.

416
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,370
I get headaches.
Okay.

417
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,070
Bang.
Prescription side.

418
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,870
I didn't know it was a headache

419
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,870
20 minutes away from me when I was
shooting at up.

420
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,440
Right in the mountains.
They had a nice like it

421
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,500
Dr. Oh yeah.
There's a place that I used to go to in

422
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,810
the mountains.
It was like a gift shop and they were

423
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:46,950
doing.
They were struggling,

424
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:49,160
they were doing terrible and you know
the fucking.

425
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,690
They were about to lose their business
and then they started selling weed in

426
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:55,410
the back of the gift shop legal.
They've got a legal license now they're

427
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,380
balling now they're.
They're about to open.

428
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,360
Their one place they opened up in
boulder is supposedly,

429
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:02,760
I don't know if it's open yet,
but they were talking about is going to

430
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:05,430
be 30,000 square feet.
It was going to be three floors.

431
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,540
I don't know if they went through with
it.

432
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,060
I need to find out if they did because
that's just the most ridiculous shit

433
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:12,990
I've ever heard.
That's a Goddamn shopping is a Walmart

434
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,330
Walmart of weed,
but they had great spots there,

435
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:16,740
man.
They had great spots where you can get

436
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,190
weed.
Yeah,

437
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,900
I got some.
No,

438
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,180
and we'd two days ago in Hollywood is 31
percent thc level.

439
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,330
You don't even necessarily.
Again,

440
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,730
it's Matt.
I've been smoking Matt since 2006 and

441
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:32,070
you got to figure that every year it
gets a little stronger.

442
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,740
It's dead straight week.
They pay this girl.

443
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,320
I forgot to bring a,
but it looks like one of the Martians

444
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:41,780
from Independence Day.
The growing around it.

445
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,030
It's like a hybrid.
What if I tell you my joint or that

446
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:47,310
right now?
Are we give it to you now?

447
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:47,940
I went and.
Got It.

448
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,780
No,
you then go get that shit.

449
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,190
What's it called?
Massive number one.

450
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:56,850
Oh Gee.
All that shit is fucking strong.

451
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,370
I had to go to the gym.
Bugs fucked up though.

452
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,563
Sounds good.
Dog.

453
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,070
Or are we going?
It's going to be fun.

454
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,300
Last time I went to Eugene,
Oregon with Jody Ferdy and we had a

455
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:08,550
Saturday night that for a one night if a
trivial,

456
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,140
but it was the same night that there was
a convention for like the American

457
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,040
Association of retarded children.

458
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,810
I don't want to say it wrong,
but it was like the children that

459
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,370
Special Olympics and they had a lot of
little retarded kids running around.

460
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:22,470
So when I go to check in,
I'm high as a motherfucker and there's

461
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,200
all these kids with balloons and I'm
just freaking.

462
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,330
Because Oregon got some deep weeds,
you know what I'm saying?

463
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:27,770
Right,
right,

464
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,160
right.
Got Some at the gas station.

465
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,750
Brian,
you're gonna love this shit.

466
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:33,730
So I got a lighter.
We checked into the hotel in Eugene and

467
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,700
Joe.
This is not 10 or 15 of them.

468
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,090
This is 600 children.
Special Olympics,

469
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,670
200 retarded ones.
And that parents.

470
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,440
Well,
so I go to my room,

471
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:44,580
you know,
we small,

472
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:46,860
we do the show.
The show is in the hotel,

473
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:48,940
but a different part.
They're having a little dance.

474
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,980
You had to see this.
They were all holding hands,

475
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,310
little balloons and the disco and it was
very cute to say,

476
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,940
but if a lot with the story that a lot
of people don't know is retarded,

477
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,400
guys,
boys are the strongest motherfuckers in

478
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:01,720
the world and that most reverted.

479
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,330
Really.
Y'All have heard that boy,

480
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:07,090
they go fucking nuts if you see them,
if you show them your pussy,

481
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,390
so listen to me.
We're in the fucking comedy club in

482
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,800
Austin.
They switch it at 10:00.

483
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,240
They switched it and turn it into a
disco

484
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,860
and jody's got a couple of cocktails and
then she started dancing.

485
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,550
She got big titties at the time and this
is little retarded boy who breaks away

486
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:25,480
from the [inaudible] pile and goes into
the dance and he starts to look at God

487
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,860
and you could see Joe Rogan that he's
losing his fucking mouth now and finally

488
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:31,730
he goes,
I one to dance was starts dancing with

489
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,280
right.
He started to answer it.

490
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,120
Then he started grinding.
When the judge thinks it's cute and all

491
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,450
of a sudden they come in and they're
like,

492
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,160
Dad,
he is dad's little David,

493
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,640
and they come to grab him and David
fucking snapped like one of those

494
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:47,110
fucking gorillas in the zoo right now.
They had three black doorman that we're

495
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:49,870
trying to tackle.
A little timid little timmy was throwing

496
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:53,080
them around like rock less madrona
around fucking John Fitch.

497
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,720
Just pick the whole offensive line of
the giants.

498
00:21:55,721 --> 00:22:00,370
Couldn't help this little retard down
fucking black gorillas and he just

499
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:01,150
pushed him on

500
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,070
on De de,
De,

501
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,980
de,
De,

502
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,813
de.

503
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,290
No titties.
He went fucking ape shit.

504
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,380
He's pushing on the counters came.
They had to throw them on the fucking

505
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:10,250
floor and put his hand up.

506
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:11,970
No,
no,

507
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,560
no.

508
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,370
And he went fucking ape shit dog.
Those little pods go fucking bananas

509
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:20,720
when you show them this little one cars
and it was just tidying.

510
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,220
Can you imagine if it was the monkey who
went,

511
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,150
jumped bro.
He's,

512
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,380
he's,
he's a university of Eugene.

513
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:29,310
These are big black football players.
They couldn't control this 12 year old.

514
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:31,870
He was banging them,
throwing them around like he was only

515
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:33,540
12,
12 or 13,

516
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:37,330
just throwing these fucking black guys
around and never forget that,

517
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:39,870
that they had to put them on the floor,
handcuffed him,

518
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,340
shoot them,
tranquilize them.

519
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,080
This little fucking poor kids seeing
teddies and he went fucking bananas and

520
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,760
as banana,
that's crazy.

521
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,240
I wonder if they're just doing what
everybody wants to do but just doesn't

522
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:54,480
have the ball they had.
They don't have the walls that to break

523
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:55,520
down.
You know what I mean?

524
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,990
What if that's what people like
instinctively want to do it.

525
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,010
Retards can't be like extra more horny
right now.

526
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,480
They probably not extra horny.
It's put that fan on them.

527
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,560
Sweat like Joe Rogan's hospitals,
the electricity.

528
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:11,970
You know what I'm saying?
You're killing me here,

529
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,420
bro.
This kid went fucking bananas.

530
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:18,150
He ripped that [inaudible].
You can't even beat them up.

531
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,050
What do you.
What do you do?

532
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,580
Do you.
You can't drop a bomb on.

533
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:23,670
The funny thing was that they built like
a wall at first make a little mouth

534
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,520
first.
They asked me to leave when he was like,

535
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,290
they're built with black guys.
Got shoulder to shoulder and he was

536
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,920
grabbing at shoulders.
Huh?

537
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,390
I mean it was fucking scary.
You don't know.

538
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:34,770
They look bad,
you know?

539
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,080
That's one of the weird things about
people that are retarded or down

540
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:40,260
syndrome or whatever.
You don't seem to know.

541
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,300
You know,
they just kind of are.

542
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,610
They just behave.
They don't go well,

543
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,050
so fucking stupid and

544
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,850
you know,
they're not like that for just

545
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,390
themselves.
You know what I mean?

546
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,280
It's like,
that must be a strange,

547
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:56,150
strange existence where you know,
that's part of being dumb is that you're

548
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:57,980
too dumb to realize you're dumb.
You know?

549
00:23:57,981 --> 00:23:59,330
And if he,
I'm not saying dumb,

550
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:01,580
like there's like they're lazy,
like they have an issue,

551
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:04,130
there's a mental issues and the mental
imbalance or whatever the fuck it is.

552
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,110
But I mean it's in there.
They're impaired,

553
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,180
but there so impaired,
they don't know they're impaired.

554
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,580
Like they've lost the ability to see
that they're impaired.

555
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,320
You know,
what a strange thing.

556
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,520
What if they all have an inner voice
that that's completely normal,

557
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,050
like,
but they can't take a to be like,

558
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,893
you know,
you know what I mean?

559
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,500
So the whole time that was just like,
I can't believe how much they treat me

560
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,580
so horrible and I wish I,
you know,

561
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,130
but they can't,
when they try to say it,

562
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,620
it's like theater.

563
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,930
There's probably,
there's probably a lot of that.

564
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,910
Yeah.
I think there was a bunch of different

565
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,300
types of,
you know,

566
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,820
being fucked up,
you know,

567
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:37,410
for sure there's that too,
you know,

568
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:38,790
it's not,
it's not just simple as.

569
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,590
Yeah,
there's some,

570
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,780
there's varying.
Yeah.

571
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,610
There's varying degrees along the way
that are,

572
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:46,830
you know,
I mean it's fucking crazy thing,

573
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:47,370
man,
to,

574
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,470
to have your mind impaired,
you know,

575
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:52,200
and like look,
our minds are impaired in comparison.

576
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:57,201
I was watching this fucking 12 year old
kid is autistic kid with 170 Iq doing

577
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,170
his take on the theory of relativity and
he's writing out equations on this

578
00:25:01,171 --> 00:25:03,030
fucking window and I'm watching this
kid.

579
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:05,400
I'm like,
this kid might as well be a fucking

580
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,570
alien.
All right.

581
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,460
I don't know what he's doing.
I have no idea.

582
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,190
He's explaining this like,
this is all simple simple shit.

583
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,030
When this is so far beyond my capacity
to him,

584
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:16,890
to this autistic kid,
I'm retarded.

585
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,070
Okay.
I am this guy who he has to humor

586
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,140
because I can't understand a fucking
word,

587
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:24,690
a letter,
a singular part of his equation.

588
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,420
I don't know what's going on up there.
It's chaos to me,

589
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,670
but to him it's so clear.
It's a language.

590
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:30,061
It's like,
well,

591
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,270
quite simply you have to move this and
this becomes x equals y equals two.

592
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,750
We are the retards to that kid.
You know,

593
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:38,700
maybe like the,
maybe like,

594
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,140
you know,
people with down syndrome.

595
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:42,120
They feel bad when people don't have
down syndrome.

596
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,760
Maybe it's just like us.
We feel bad with people who have autism,

597
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:49,170
like poor kid's got autism and he can't
engage in all the normal emotional

598
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:51,100
things that we do.
Meanwhile this motherfuckers,

599
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,910
you know,
count counting to a billion in his head

600
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,070
while he,
while he's talking to you about how a

601
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,500
television is conduct constructed,
you know,

602
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:00,550
maybe we're recharged to them.
Maybe you know,

603
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,630
they look at us and I go this Port Fox,
they can't even do math in their head.

604
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:05,400
They don't,
they can't see through walls.

605
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,860
They can't read people's minds,
you know,

606
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,290
but some people just had a kid in the
eighth grade,

607
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:14,590
his name was Michael Alig,
Gretta's assuming kid he had been fresh

608
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:17,530
off the boat in the fucking sixth grade
by the eighth grade.

609
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:22,531
This motherfucker spoke three languages,
all that Sicilian shit.

610
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:28,780
But he picked up Spanish and he picked
up English and I used to just sit and

611
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:30,310
look at them or do you know what I'm
saying?

612
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:33,580
Like he was such a cool motherfucker
that I just wanted to hang with and he

613
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:34,690
was so.
And he was married.

614
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:36,730
We used to play when you,
when we used to play hockey,

615
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:39,160
we eliminate the chins with the,
with the hockey stick.

616
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:39,641
And he goes,
Oh yeah,

617
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:39,861
yeah,
yeah,

618
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:40,121
yeah,
yeah,

619
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:40,391
yeah,
yeah,

620
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:40,671
yeah,
yeah,

621
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:41,220
yeah,
yeah.

622
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,160
So I would die.
He was never

623
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,160
drift to the bag with my dog,
but this kid knew nothing when we came

624
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,230
off a boat,
January in the sixth grade,

625
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:54,060
by the eighth grade knew three fucking
language.

626
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:57,780
He would talk to me in Spanish,
talk to you in English like nothing and

627
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:58,740
get a's.
You know,

628
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:00,870
some people.
Real work ethic to.

629
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,190
It's.
Some people just,

630
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,400
they have this insane work ethic and
people that get a chance to come to

631
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,860
America.
It's so much different than being born

632
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:10,740
in America.
We don't have any fucking idea.

633
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,701
You live,
you know,

634
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:14,040
you're living in fucking Guatemala or
some shit.

635
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:14,471
You know,
your,

636
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:17,010
your opportunities are few and far
between.

637
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,590
You know,
you live in someplace that's

638
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,463
impoverished.
You're,

639
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
you're kind of fucked man.
But when you're in America,

640
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:23,790
dude,
Holy Shit.

641
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,800
So these guys,
you know,

642
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,070
their family gets them together.
Look,

643
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,000
we're going to move to America.

644
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,160
I have a better life.
And you realize you're leaving

645
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:33,060
everything behind and you're putting all
your fucking ship and cargo planes and

646
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,560
you're all sitting together crammed in,
coach and you know,

647
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,740
eating fruit out of your mom's purse and
you know,

648
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,100
just hoping that when you get there
things are going to be better and you

649
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:42,900
don't know anybody there.
And how scary is this?

650
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,610
So when those motherfuckers get to
school,

651
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:46,830
they come out guns blazing,
you know,

652
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,400
they appreciate the fact that Holy Shit,
I used to live in Italy.

653
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,430
Now here I am in the land of the free,
the home of the brave.

654
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,700
You know,
I'm in America and I'm in school and I'm

655
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:59,940
learning English and I'm just going to
go fucking crazy over here.

656
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,170
They're just so happy.
And she'll rub.

657
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,620
That's the one 10th of it because I
didn't leave Cuba Cronin.

658
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,350
We moved here.

659
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,760
I woke up on 89th street in riverside
drive.

660
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,160
I had all the fucking things that a rich
kid.

661
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,730
And here I was walking around this
fucking city,

662
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:17,850
but I didn't know English.
And all you want to do in your heart is

663
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:21,750
just fit in and you have no idea.
This is not trying to fit in when you

664
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:24,180
were in grammar school and you should
get a tattoo long hair.

665
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,790
Oh,
you want to know is for them not to know

666
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:30,690
that you came from somewhere else that I
can't describe it to you.

667
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:34,950
I can't even stop and start to tell you.
Like sometimes I have this anger at me

668
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:39,480
and it's because I was so lucky.
We're so lucky.

669
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,780
I need three of us could have been born
one of those black kids and fucking eat

670
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:45,000
with flies on you.
Any three of us.

671
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,460
And we have so many fucking
opportunities.

672
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,860
And sometimes I wake up in the morning,
this really hits me.

673
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:53,940
Sometimes I go home and fuck and lucky
that my mother came here and here I am

674
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:57,150
sitting here smoking though.
But I know what I'm saying.

675
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:59,460
Like think about what an immigrant was
like.

676
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,860
You know,
I'm telling him for a long time I've

677
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:03,900
been writing this thing and that's how
it starts with the,

678
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,790
you know,
I don't remember anything.

679
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,400
I don't remember the plane ride from
Cuba.

680
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:10,800
I remember nothing.
All I remember is crossing the fucking

681
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:15,801
street on 89th and Broadway up to
[inaudible] 66 and thinking to myself,

682
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,000
fuck,
I'm going to be a fucking American.

683
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,600
What does that mean?
Looking at that flag and you really

684
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:25,050
believe in something dog.
It's not just a piece of fucking rag

685
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,080
looking at that flag and going,
what the fuck?

686
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:30,480
Like looking at the wind blowing that
flag and going,

687
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,710
what the fuck?

688
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,830
That flag is the answer to all my
fucking problem.

689
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,370
That's the answer right there.
But even at that age I knew my mother

690
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:40,080
was fucking crazy,
so I do.

691
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:44,530
I wasn't a full flight American,
but when you look at that flag and you

692
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:47,530
just come here,
they have a scene in the beginning of

693
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,640
scarface when they're on the boat and
they finally see land and they showed

694
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:54,190
the American flag and the director,
whoever the guy is brilliant enough to

695
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:56,320
show.
He showed it from a different angle.

696
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:59,500
What that flag looks like.
It's not just we overlooked that flag

697
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:02,110
every fucking day.
We overlooked that flag.

698
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,170
You don't know what it is to look at
that flag when you first come in and to

699
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,200
know that that's your.
That's your magic carpet.

700
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,320
It's the highest ideal in the world.
It's the highest ideal.

701
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:14,770
That's why it's so infuriating when
politicians are fucking corrupt.

702
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,820
That's why it's so.
You know,

703
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:18,100
people say,
why do you criticize what America does

704
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:19,480
overseas?
Don't you love America?

705
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,590
Yeah.
If you love it,

706
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:22,720
you want to tell the fucking truth about
what it's doing.

707
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,770
You know,
if you love it,

708
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,020
you're supposed to stand up and go,
what the fuck is going on?

709
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,010
It's like you don't love it by letting
it get away with stupid shit because

710
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,650
there's some corrupt concept.
The wheel that's not.

711
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,690
It doesn't mean you don't love the idea
of America.

712
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:36,700
I fucking love the idea of America for
sure.

713
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,280
I always remember we only see the one
side of that flag.

714
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,950
We never see both sides together
gentlemen,

715
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,550
and that's a point we never.
We only see that one side of the flag

716
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,250
right now.
You've discussed that the CIA is setting

717
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:51,270
up things in Libya.
What are they setting up this starting a

718
00:30:51,271 --> 00:30:52,420
war that started in business.

719
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,780
They're getting things going.
That's the other side of that flag that

720
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:58,690
will never able to see.
We only see once you put a mirror on the

721
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,220
other side of the flag.
You know what I'm saying?

722
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:03,400
That's the one side of the flag that we
have since we accept this side of the

723
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:05,080
flag,
we got to accept that.

724
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:09,310
So the only way that side this side is
possible where it's easy to drive around

725
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:11,290
is if they're doing all this creepy shit
you gotta bring.

726
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,250
Unless we bring the whole world together
in on everything and that's just not

727
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:17,440
going to happen and we've done fucking
shit.

728
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:22,420
Do Creepy Shit to trust them.
You can't trust people to be cool.

729
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,310
You know the look,
the natural instinct,

730
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:27,430
if someone can get into a position of
power is to be Kadafi.

731
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,940
That's the natural instinct.
The natural instinct is to get botox.

732
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,220
When you're 80,
you have this big stupid liquid rubber

733
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:36,760
face were goofy clothes and just be
running shit.

734
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,990
Even though you're this old con,
you know,

735
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,250
living in some fucking castle with
billions of dollars doing that job,

736
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,880
can you tell me why is he going with me?
We put billions of dollars from money.

737
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,730
That inside of that flag is money.
Joe Rogan.

738
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:50,950
That's a lot of people.
Never had comprehend that.

739
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,710
That's the reality of it.
Stand up is a beautiful thing to do.

740
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,770
Some guys are brilliant and some guys
aren't millionaires.

741
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,530
The other fall between the crack,
the other side of the standup up,

742
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:02,470
it's a business.
It really is a fucking business guys and

743
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:04,960
it's like anything else.
The other side of that flag is a

744
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:07,990
business guys and the same way we want
social security.

745
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:10,790
One was 65.
A country as a dual sell a couple of

746
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,810
kilos every once in a while to replenish
those fucking funds.

747
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,570
You know what I'm saying?
And that's aside of the American public.

748
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,240
Don't want to know that society that
included Kennedy.

749
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,090
That's aside.
The Alex Jones talks about whether it's

750
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:24,400
true or not.
That's society we not supposed to see

751
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,980
was supposed to be focused on the other
side on what that machine is supposed to

752
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,620
mean to us and for guys like you and I
like looking behind the curtain,

753
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:35,650
but I don't.
I don't because I grew up in a in a

754
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:39,190
corrupt hometown.
They seen what politics is at a minute

755
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,190
level.
I can't even dream of what it is at a

756
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:45,500
national level when I'm taking political
contributions,

757
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:48,500
but I'm going to pass your fucking bills
so you could pass that law.

758
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,890
That'll make people's hands grow back,
but they're also going to give them

759
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:54,050
cancer in the eyeballs.
That's part of it.

760
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,300
It grows.
If when I grew up in it,

761
00:32:56,301 --> 00:33:00,530
when it was in the micro process,
I now it's in the national level of

762
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:05,000
corruption isn't a macro process and it
starts with little things and townships

763
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,130
where if it's a macro smaller than my
micro macro,

764
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,380
a little high.
I'm sorry guys,

765
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,780
but you understand my know exactly what
you're saying.

766
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,110
It's very interesting.
Corruption if not checked,

767
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:16,910
grows.
It all just keeps getting bigger.

768
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,900
It's not like they go,
hey,

769
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:20,480
we got to cut the shit.
I know we've been making millions of

770
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,790
dollars on the sneak tip,
but everybody's to stop right now and

771
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:23,630
I'm not kidding.

772
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,100
Why are you still making money?
These wiki leak things are pretty cool

773
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:28,980
for the country.
I think in general,

774
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,940
that's why these assholes want to put
that guy in jail.

775
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:32,590
They want to say it compromises
Americans can.

776
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,401
No,
it doesn't.

777
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:35,440
He,
he did exactly what the New York Times

778
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:37,210
was supposed to do.
If they got that information,

779
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,890
they should have done that on twitter
though.

780
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,230
Can you imagine if there was just like
this twitter address that everyone

781
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:43,300
followed that every tweet,
twitter,

782
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,440
by the way,
JFK,

783
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:45,690
here's pictures of JFK,
so,

784
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,780
and cocaine to do.
Wikileaks has a twitter and they really,

785
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,360
they really shouldn't have twitter.
They released some,

786
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:53,220
uh,
an artist article

787
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,180
about how um,
different parts of the American economy

788
00:33:57,181 --> 00:34:00,570
are influenced by genetically modified
foods and how we're trying to force them

789
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,000
on other countries.
And they were like fucking with other

790
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,890
countries.
If they don't go into the genetically

791
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:07,330
modified food,
if they don't start growing like

792
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,880
Monsanto corn,
shit like that,

793
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,020
you know those that,
that,

794
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,530
that,
those,

795
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,500
these giant companies are way too
embedded into the political system.

796
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,410
They're not doing stuff for the greater
good of people there doing stuff for the

797
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:19,830
profitability of giant corporations that
moved them into position in the first

798
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:21,720
place.
The whole thing has been corrupted,

799
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,380
like to sit down and pretend that,
that,

800
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:26,400
that it's real.
It's insulting.

801
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,680
It's like a,
it's like a stupid argument.

802
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,870
It's like people argue about pro
wrestling,

803
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,561
you know,
it's like,

804
00:34:31,561 --> 00:34:35,040
what are you arguing about?
This is a fake nonsense process.

805
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,660
If you can't notice that from Obama,
Obama's going to pull all the troop out

806
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:39,990
of,
I can't.

807
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:43,500
Oh he's not.
Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize and then

808
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:46,410
he sent 30,000 more troops to
Afghanistan.

809
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,640
I mean,
come on man,

810
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,820
look at all the shit that he's done to
allow these kids to get away with

811
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:52,820
stealing all that fucking money and that
bailout.

812
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,260
I watched that inside job movie.
Dude.

813
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:59,370
That shit is disgusting.
It's disgusting how deep the corruption

814
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:00,240
is.
The financial,

815
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:01,740
uh,
the whole financial sector,

816
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,060
it's scary,
dude.

817
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,470
They have the people that are regulators
eventually get jobs with the banks,

818
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,630
like how the fuck you're telling me you
work as a guy who's working for the sec

819
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,330
and you're looking into banks and
corruption and shit like that.

820
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,970
And then when you quit,
you get a job with the bank.

821
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,770
How the fuck are you not in jail?
How the fuck are you not in jail?

822
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,300
You were the one responsible for looking
over these motherfuckers while they were

823
00:35:27,301 --> 00:35:32,301
doing all sorts of crazy shit betting on
things failing and betting three times

824
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:35,810
more than that a business is worth and
speculums and,

825
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,300
and,
and,

826
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,133
and,
and bedding.

827
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Fucking forcing clients to buy shit they
knew wasn't good.

828
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,280
Like they did a lot of crazy,
creepy shit and got away with it.

829
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm the only one who got popped.
Is that Bernie Madoff?

830
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,980
Those motherfuckers should all be in
jail.

831
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,130
This should be a mass jailing and
they're not.

832
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,160
They're not jailing anybody.
Then it's bullshit.

833
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,830
Then it's all bullshit.
It's all bullshit that they're not you.

834
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,210
You got to like hold them the most
accountable you can and it's barely at

835
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:03,480
all

836
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,810
people's dreams,
people's dreams.

837
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,240
When you steal people's dreams,
that's the worst thing in the fucking

838
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:11,730
world.
You 63 years old or so,

839
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:16,430
somebody calls you and says you're not
going to get you your money at 66 or 67.

840
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,670
All that money you put away.

841
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,470
That happens.
Those guys a lot too.

842
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,970
Tap into a lot of fucking people.
People at 60.

843
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,540
I just watched him about a month ago.
People 71 getting part time,

844
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,770
fucking jobs now this extreme,

845
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,710
this fucking movie showed,
I believe it was Iceland,

846
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,540
how they went in and Jack the Icelandic
economy in like a couple of years these

847
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:41,541
banks went in and just fucking do is
created bubbles and started making crazy

848
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:45,630
money and spending an access and then it
all failed and people are fucked.

849
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,290
They had like the most stable,
the most informalized economy.

850
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,650
Like it was a beautiful economy.
Everything was running smooth people.

851
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:54,750
We're hard workers.
People got shit done.

852
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,180
They lived a life of relative
prosperity.

853
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,730
Now they're fucked.
Everybody lost everything.

854
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,060
Everyone's fucked.
Everyone.

855
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:03,240
Yeah.
The states,

856
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,130
I think it already has already recast,
what is this be allowed?

857
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,910
What?
What is this?

858
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,790
How do you,
how did these people get money when when

859
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:10,970
the banks failed,
they,

860
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,450
they will.
They have bonuses in their contract is

861
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,390
how the fuck do you get a bonus when the
bank fails?

862
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,570
Like the idea that you have to respect
them and that they can't lose.

863
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,690
That's just there.
It's so crazy.

864
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,840
Bonuses.
The millions and millions of dollars,

865
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,370
and this is from banks.
When we would take to pay them,

866
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,140
we gave them money and they're giving
out money.

867
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,720
Either way.
If your bank fucking failed,

868
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,010
you can't get a bonus.
You can't get a bonus bank fucking

869
00:37:39,011 --> 00:37:41,680
failed.
Do you take no personal responsibility?

870
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,930
Like who takes responsibility?
Somebody.

871
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,780
And it shouldn't be the guy that stands
to make a bonus.

872
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,940
If the bank does well,
that should be the guy who takes

873
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:51,520
personal responsibility.
So when the bank fucking fails,

874
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,890
you don't get your bonus con face.
It's it.

875
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,050
It's that simple.
Why?

876
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,760
Why the fuck can't the president say
that?

877
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,610
Is the studies like we're gonna,
you know,

878
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,700
limited to half a million dollars,
half a million fucking dollars for a

879
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:05,980
bonus when your bank fails,
what do you want?

880
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:10,270
These motherfuckers are so not living in
reality in most people's reality.

881
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,390
These cons costs so many fucking people.
Their life savings and they have to get

882
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,820
their bonuses and the president is like,
well,

883
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,660
we have to give it to him.
What the fuck are you talking about?

884
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:22,510
You have to give it to them.
You can't just step into the cut the

885
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,730
shit.
Are you fucking crazy?

886
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,250
No.
You can't get $30,

887
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:28,420
million dollars after your fucking bank
fails.

888
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,770
No.
In the middle of a crazy.

889
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:32,700
Down to economy where billions of
dollars from taxpayers.

890
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,540
What?
He'd been funneled to fucking banks to

891
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,530
keep my.
No,

892
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,040
you can't get

893
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,560
a bonus.
Fuckhead you lucky you have a job.

894
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:40,720
You're lucky you're head is attached to
your fucking shoulder.

895
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,790
Like about getting 90 fucking years.
Yeah.

896
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,100
You're lucky you're not in jail forever
in Haiti.

897
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,660
Have you follow what's going on in the
city of Bell Bell Bell Bell.

898
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,400
California is a city that the fucking
guys just jacked him.

899
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,720
What happened?
Like the fuck you gotta get up early in

900
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:57,820
the water for this because they talking
about like Gates Ela.

901
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:01,090
It's a city here of bell off the six.
Oh five or something.

902
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,010
And all the man,
everybody.

903
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:07,420
It was as corrupt as can be.
They have been Jack and millions.

904
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,450
So if it's at that city of Bell,
if the corruption is that deep,

905
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:16,240
the cops will have any ticket contests
real everyday on the news.

906
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:18,610
They come up with more shit.
The guy just got reinvited.

907
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:23,170
This is all Old Jersey shilling school
clear as Bell Bell,

908
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:23,890
California.

909
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,730
It's I think like
30 minutes from here,

910
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,800
so 30,
45 minutes,

911
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,120
but they just been having this shit in
there lately.

912
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,390
It's a shitstorm.
They all go.

913
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,030
They will all stealing.
All five guys are stealing.

914
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:41,780
Big Boys don't understand how they feel
like no one's gonna get caught with good

915
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,320
fucking trail memory,
good fellows and Robert Dinero how to

916
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:46,210
start killing people because you're
spending too much money.

917
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,370
It's the same goddamn thing.
Man.

918
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,200
That was a great scene,
wasn't it?

919
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,050
When you realized that guy came in,
his wife had a fucking beautiful fur

920
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:53,861
coat on,
it's like,

921
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:56,380
what the fuck are you doing?
And then they they know they have to

922
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:59,470
kill this guy and then there's photos of
him and his wife shot in the car.

923
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:04,410
What a great goddamn movie that was on
the day and I walked in the part with

924
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:07,900
her at the mother's house and the
borrowing the knife,

925
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,800
but you gotta think of that whole scene
that borrowed a knife to stab this guy

926
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:14,740
in the car.
Meanwhile eating the guys in the trunk

927
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:17,890
of the car like it's the fourth of July
there.

928
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,590
Eat eggs and bread and fucking telling
stories.

929
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,770
Remember the pain thing?

930
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,190
That is such a sick fucking movie right
there.

931
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,800
Great moving.
What do you want from me?

932
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,310
There's not that many of those.
There's very few of those that ever get

933
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:34,170
that good.
You know,

934
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,040
there's very few movies that ever like
hit that.

935
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,040
That's like a perfect movie.
Goodfellas is like a perfect fucking

936
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,570
movie.
Everything about it,

937
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,150
especially when you see it.
Twenty years later when she was

938
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:46,390
screaming at Ray Liotta and he run,
he starts laughing and runs away because

939
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,750
gacked out of his fucking mind,
she's screaming at me and he's laughing.

940
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,580
Man.
When they were were packaging up the

941
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:54,070
coke and his girlfriend was getting
pissed off,

942
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,791
you know,
she's [inaudible],

943
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,710
he's Kinda just fucking making coke for
him now.

944
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:59,720
He was banging her on the side,
still with his wife and he's got a

945
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,410
packaging coke for them and then you
know,

946
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,370
he,
he leaves laughing and she fucking

947
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:04,480
throws the coke at the door.

948
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
You remember?
That show is the craziest thing ever.

949
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,700
I said,
it's the craziest thing ever.

950
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,670
When he gets to that scene,
and I did coke for 30 years.

951
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:16,600
When he gets to that scene and he snorts
and he pops his head up and his eyes

952
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:20,710
dilate right in front of the camera.
That scene is why I turned the movie of

953
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,340
really it bothers me to go.
And you know what bothers me because he

954
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:27,610
steals it though.
He taps into the coat when he's standing

955
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:30,630
there with his arms,
watch it again when she's wearing it and

956
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,290
he's standing there with his arms
folded.

957
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,480
I'm telling you,
you're seeing it with my arms.

958
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,343
Felt that

959
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,180
that potential energy,
you're ready to explode.

960
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:39,810
You can't even take watching that.
Fill that bucket.

961
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,540
I'm below when he sees the fucking that
helicopter,

962
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,520
you know it's behind you.
That chitter chatter they have.

963
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,550
That's paranoid talk.
Why can't we go to your mother's house?

964
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,650
When they dropped the guns off?
Can you imagine joe?

965
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:53,780
What can we go to your mother's house
and drop off guns.

966
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,430
They had this chitter chatter when he
gets out of jail and he's feeling for

967
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:02,210
the coke and he comes home and he's
trying to tell her that he wanted for

968
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:04,070
money.
He wants to get high.

969
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,080
I been there,
Karen.

970
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,370
Karen,
what you do?

971
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:10,010
It was what we saw.
We had Karen,

972
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,160
that whole chitter chatter looking how
high they are and he just passes out and

973
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:16,700
just pass out.
Perfect.

974
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:20,390
Yeah,
they just pass out from the ghetto.

975
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,140
We had $60,000,
dollars,

976
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,060
a fucking thing he had in the ceiling.
What?

977
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,400
Cops wouldn't have found a great fucking
movie though,

978
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,820
but it's amazing when he's looking up at
the helicopters and he's driving so

979
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,380
fucking yes.
When he was in the car and he thought it

980
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,320
was over and he's getting rid of guns,
right?

981
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,154
Wasn't it?
Yeah.

982
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:41,240
You have no idea what it is to get
caught up in this little room that look

983
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:43,790
out that window or by the blunt,
and

984
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,570
there'll be a.
What do you call those things?

985
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:48,404
A fire hydrant,

986
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,910
but in your mind becomes a dog.
Could you imagine if you got Osama bin

987
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,580
Ladin cooked up?
Could you imagine if you got someone,

988
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:01,030
someone like Gaddafi coked up right now,
how paranoid he would be if they just

989
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:02,540
go,
does it.

990
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,260
You think he does coke?
Of course you're a fucking terrorist.

991
00:43:05,261 --> 00:43:07,320
You're probably fucking fucking hookers
looked.

992
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,190
The coffee's not a terrorist.
He's a.

993
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,220
he's a dictator.
I mean,

994
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,730
I mean he's.
But I mean,

995
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,960
yeah,
it's the same thing.

996
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,340
That was a bad,
bad person.

997
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,760
Enemy better person.

998
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,230
That was a guy called Carlo something
that was part of the middling cartel

999
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:23,870
with the eighties bad motherfucker when
that was in charge of bringing it up all

1000
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:26,450
the blow.
He got so crazy and I'm not in a deer

1001
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,010
call.
Lowe's.

1002
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:29,120
Yeah.
What's his last name?

1003
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:32,330
He runs and they did call his name.
He was the one that didn't blow up.

1004
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:34,880
I might've made that up.
Blow was the guy on the island that he

1005
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:38,330
went to visit Johnny Depp.
The guy with the blue eyes that had the

1006
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:42,800
machine guns and shit with this guy.
His name is Carlo laid there Les Paul's

1007
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,420
Dad got his sentence reduced.
He got like 900 years.

1008
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:50,220
Knocked off his sentence.
He's still got four more to do.

1009
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,010
He's the one that went to the government
and said,

1010
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:54,590
doctor,
I gave her adult envelopes face to face.

1011
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,800
Wow.
And the laid there,

1012
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,520
how they nailed him was he was actually
getting cameras like Ryan does,

1013
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,520
sending them around the room.

1014
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,220
He got a plate below.
He sit there and make it with a towel on

1015
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,450
and just do bumps and every once in a
while he'd go like this,

1016
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:09,850
a chicken coming to suck his dick.
It.

1017
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:15,470
He
just tell poetry all day and finally

1018
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:19,760
they got the cartel got their hands on
this and they were like,

1019
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:21,890
this can't happen.
Get Bullshit on the phone.

1020
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,840
Bush.
We've got something for you.

1021
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,340
Right.
I'll tell you exactly where he is.

1022
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:30,110
We're going to email to tape the
cartel gave him up real.

1023
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:30,944
Exactly.
Yeah.

1024
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,330
They couldn't take that.
This guy was folded.

1025
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:37,140
He's making videos of themselves naked,
sweating with his eyes.

1026
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:41,430
This big blow for 24 hour pop.
Fuck Charlie Sheen.

1027
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:46,431
This guy was naked doing bumps and say
he's talking about La Luna,

1028
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,990
you know,
stars in the middle.

1029
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:54,480
Then he would go on on a chicken coming
to suck his dick and he was like,

1030
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:54,910
shoot.

1031
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:58,800
And they will take her on tape and they
just keep you see him pull the buyer

1032
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:02,100
rankles and should he be bleeding?
And then he'd do more bloated.

1033
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:05,490
I wish I was lying to you.
This guy was killing people on tape,

1034
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:08,370
doing blogs,
just not eating for days,

1035
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,750
a brilliant shit,
and then they stick one of the Middle

1036
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,180
East,
God tell,

1037
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:12,810
got this,
and they're like,

1038
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,630
we can't have this.
When they went and got him and brought

1039
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:17,340
him back,
they still have those pictures of him on

1040
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,920
the plane next to a marine.
He's just looking around like,

1041
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:21,980
what the fuck do I do?
He lives exactly.

1042
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,650
Turn them in.

1043
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,640
Holy Shit.
Did you see you saw cocaine cowboys,

1044
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:27,360
right?
Yeah.

1045
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,171
No,
that woman,

1046
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:31,380
what's her name was elder elder.
She's out.

1047
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,510
She's back in Colombia,
man.

1048
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,100
They got pictures of her in Columbia at
the airport hanging out free and this is

1049
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,850
the movie,
just detail after detail.

1050
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:44,490
How many people she had killed that
pitch.

1051
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,850
The godmother,
I think they call them [inaudible].

1052
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:51,150
She made so much money.
Hundreds and hundreds of millions of

1053
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,200
dollars in money,
man.

1054
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,900
She was killing people left and right.
They got this guy who's her hitman who's

1055
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,560
in jail and they interview him in jail
and he's just telling them all the

1056
00:45:58,561 --> 00:46:00,570
different times.
Griselda had made me kill this guy,

1057
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:02,880
so I had to go do some business and I
killed this guy,

1058
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:05,430
how to do some business,
and I said I wouldn't do that because

1059
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:08,070
they wanted me to do a drive by and
there was a baby in the car.

1060
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,200
Whoa.
It was fucking Colombian.

1061
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,300
They used to shoot anything.
There's a picture of you go on.

1062
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:17,120
Daily News archives.
Nineteen 84.

1063
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,240
A Colombian family in Brooklyn got
slaughtered.

1064
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,120
Well,
the kid in the room for the wake was 14

1065
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:25,280
bodies and there was 12 kids.
Oh,

1066
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,910
Monday.
They sat the kids down to the 12 and

1067
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,800
bullets and they're fucking forehead.
Oh my God.

1068
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:32,510
The pictures,
they don't show the bodies,

1069
00:46:32,511 --> 00:46:36,620
but they show the funeral parlor and
just the role of fucking bodies,

1070
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:40,370
these Colombians and over nothing.
This isn't the eighties when they were

1071
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:42,530
shooting you over $2 just to make that
point.

1072
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,260
You know you're always fucking money was
going to shoot you.

1073
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,140
That was the big thing about them,
right?

1074
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:50,450
The Colombians were always taught to be
the most like Colombian neckties fucking

1075
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,690
throw out.
Pull your tongue out.

1076
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,240
They wanted.
They wanted an intimidation at the

1077
00:46:55,241 --> 00:46:59,440
maximum you of fucking savages.
That's right next door to us,

1078
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,450
buddy.
That's just like what's going on in

1079
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:03,790
Mexico that's happening right now in a
bigger,

1080
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:05,380
even bigger scale,
you know,

1081
00:47:05,381 --> 00:47:07,510
because the Colombians,
even though they had like they were

1082
00:47:07,511 --> 00:47:10,270
selling drugs and they were bringing
drugs and they weren't getting that much

1083
00:47:10,271 --> 00:47:12,620
resistance from their government.
You know what I mean?

1084
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,990
There's was Kinda.
It was,

1085
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,850
yeah,
it was kind of cropped.

1086
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:18,340
But in Mexico it's not the same man.
Mexico,

1087
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:20,430
they get a lot of resistance,
but it doesn't matter.

1088
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:21,970
It's those dealing it.
They're still doing it,

1089
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:25,510
so it's scarier because it's more like
it's more militaristic

1090
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:31,200
in Spanish.
Global.

1091
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:33,880
That's the expression,
bro.

1092
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,870
That's a silver cash.
That's a finished from the rubber guard

1093
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,190
below more or blah blah,
blah.

1094
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:44,080
It's called either bullets or money.
Which one they just show up and which

1095
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:44,914
ones?
Bullets.

1096
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,350
A poloma plumber is bullets.
Yeah.

1097
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,890
Blocked out as cash.
So they bought a plot that they just

1098
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:53,240
show up at your house,
but a Gundam with an envelope lot more

1099
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,840
blocks.
That should be a new rap song.

1100
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,120
You want to your call,
that's how they would go around to

1101
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:05,350
Columbia
is a poor fucking girl who was a member.

1102
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:10,810
That girl was trying to be a sheriff and
a some town in a near Juarez.

1103
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,280
Remember that Shit.
She was 20 years old.

1104
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:15,970
There's a big story because this is
college girl decides she's going to

1105
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:20,680
fucking get a a job as a sheriff and try
to clean up the town within months.

1106
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,710
This poor girl is trying to seek asylum
in America because they're trying to

1107
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:25,270
kill her a little.
Slice your fucking throat.

1108
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,460
Look,
you're either in or you're out.

1109
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,980
There's no coming back.
There's no,

1110
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:30,814
no,
no.

1111
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,060
That's a different society.
This isn't the Sapphire.

1112
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,390
This isn't a.
it's terrifying.

1113
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:40,780
Shit is terrifying.
That is terrifying that we're not doing

1114
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:42,820
anything about it,
but yet we're fucking around in Libya.

1115
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,260
April one,
1984.

1116
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:45,460
December twelfth,
19,

1117
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:47,500
84.
I was minding my business or 83.

1118
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:53,220
I was minding my business is snowmass
village that was just snorting coke and

1119
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:56,710
going to school at night,
but he just had an electrician's job and

1120
00:48:56,711 --> 00:48:58,420
I heard this boom,
but I didn't know what happened.

1121
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:00,960
I just went to bed the next day.
They were telling me a story about this

1122
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:05,000
drug dealer named Steven Gray Book.
He got in the fucking car with the star

1123
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,940
that they put a bomb under his fucking
car.

1124
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:09,220
They asked me to Colorado Tam,
some white dude,

1125
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:13,570
and I asked her rather than the papers,
he was about to go on trial for tax

1126
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:16,810
evasion,
Jewish guy that was in with the

1127
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:17,230
Colombian.
