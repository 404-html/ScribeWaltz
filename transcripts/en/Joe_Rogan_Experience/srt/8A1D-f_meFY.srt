1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,970
Good. All right. We live, uh,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,240
this is a perfect time for me to talk
to you about this because I just took a

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:09,990
yoga class and had a vegan
lunch. Awesome. How do you feel?

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,500
I feel like numb. [inaudible]
I feel centered. Yeah.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,310
I feel like my shockers are in line.
I feel fine. What were you, were,

6
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:19,310
you were to have a Vegan lunch?
Did you,

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,050
did you travel over there with like costs?

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,530
Drop a note to like a car without
leather seats? No, no, no. It was, yeah,

9
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,270
it's not really a Vegan lunch. Like
the car had leather seats. Yes.

10
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:32,660
So they also on top of that, like
your Tofu, was it meat flavored? No,

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,680
I didn't have tofu would
just add vegetables. Okay.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,560
Well vegetables that
taste like vegetables.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,930
I did kill a mosquito as
soon as I got out of my car,

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,410
so I don't think that's Vegan either.
Well, sounds like you're a murderer.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,520
Sounds like it to me. Corey. Uh,

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,480
if you don't know that Knowlton last week,
right where we're at,

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,920
pronounced y'alls name, you've got, um,

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,760
one of the reasons why I wanted
to have you on this podcast is a,

19
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:55,980
I'm a big fan of Jim Shockey.

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,940
Jim Shockey show the
uncharted show and um,

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,390
something's going up my nose and
I'd seen you, uh, on that show.

22
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,730
So when the controversy broke,

23
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,060
a CNN covered the story for
folks who don't know what
we're talking about, Corey,

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,703
um,

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,070
you bid money to be one of the people
that got a chance to kill a black rhino.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,190
Um,

27
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,190
for people who are not aware of
how conservation and hunting work,

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,450
what they try to do,
especially with endangered species,

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,630
is they have to sometimes protect
endangered species from their own.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,730
And it seems very counterintuitive,
um,

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,540
for people who are on the outside
looking in, you say, well,

32
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,980
this is an endangered animal.

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,760
Why are you killing one of these
endangered animals and trying to call this

34
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:52,740
conservation. But with rhinos in
particular or a lot of aggressive animals,

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,810
even giraffes, the older males,
the older bulls, the older,

36
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,620
um,
non breeding members of these groups.

37
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,650
Sometimes we'll attack the young males
and killed them and females and females

38
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,730
and Kat cab,
you'll kill everything.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,360
And it is just a natural part of being a
wild animal when the numbers are strong

40
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:18,570
and healthy. It's like it happens
in bears every day of the week.

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,710
It's just a part of being a bear.
But when it happens with, uh,

42
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,130
something that's endangered,
like a black rhino,

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,160
they're forced into a very peculiar
situation where they have to most likely

44
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,120
either kill or put this
animal in captivity. My right.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,710
A lot of different, uh, different
situations depending on the animal,

46
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:42,720
what's actually doing.
Right. But yes, I mean,

47
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,540
some of the things you're talking about,
could it apply?

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,490
And this is where it
gets counter intuitive.

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,410
So they have a bid and the
bid gets to you. You want it,

50
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,820
what does it, $350,000, correct?
Yes. It's a lot of fucking money.

51
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,930
Um, and you went over
there, you shot this rhino.

52
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,490
All that money went towards aiding the
rhino was there wasn't enough money.

53
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,371
It wasn't,

54
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:12,371
and it should have been a lot more money
because they need more money or perhaps

55
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,170
more money.
And,

56
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,170
and the value of that was greater than
that amount of money was that was the

57
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:24,180
amount of money that I was able
to call together and make happen.

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,980
The anti hunting community in the animal
rights community came out so strongly

59
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:32,540
against this situation for what I think,

60
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,170
either misunderstanding or they were
trying to keep the contribution down.

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,990
Um,
one of the other or both.

62
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,920
And there's people who were much wealthier
than I am and had a lot more money

63
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:51,090
who really wanted to spend the money,
but at the time,

64
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,550
I don't think that they, they had a better
idea of what was to come than I did.

65
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,120
I guess I was a little bit naive
about it. Um, but these people are,

66
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,350
a couple of them are very
well known people and I don't
think they wanted to put

67
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:07,590
their employees and their company
and you know, they're alive.

68
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:12,020
They're family to the same things
that I ended up going through. And um,

69
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,510
they were basically chased out
by the anti hunting communities,

70
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,410
rhetoric and their attacks.

71
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,770
What, what was surprising to
you about this whole experience?

72
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:27,590
Because it had to be a pretty
life changing experience.

73
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,750
Like you're a guy who's a,
you know,

74
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,800
relatively famous in the hunting world,

75
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,810
you being on that Jim Shockey show and
you decide that you want to be the guy.

76
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,570
So you,
you spend all this money out.

77
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,430
What was your goal when
you wanted to do this?

78
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:45,080
Did you want to bring awareness to this?

79
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:47,750
Was it something that you felt
strongly about from the very beginning?

80
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,560
I've always felt very strongly about

81
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,070
conservation and hunting. Okay.
Ever since I was young and,

82
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:55,880
um,

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,880
but the way this came about was a
friend of mine who runs a company called

84
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,990
conservation for us,
or a nonprofit five zero one c three.

85
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,420
And he came to me and said,
look,

86
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,390
the people I had that are
bidding on this are gone.

87
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,730
And he asked me if I would bid on it.

88
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,420
And the bid that I made was basically
within very close to the minimum bid.

89
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,450
There was really no one else

90
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,520
really. Yeah. The minimum bid was
$350,000. You got to keep them on.

91
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:29,500
They sell these over or

92
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,200
in Namibia,
they have auctions amongst themselves.

93
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,020
This was the first one that
took place in the United States.

94
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:39,470
That's why I brought so much publicity.
This wasn't the first rhino,

95
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,330
it was to be brought
into the United States.

96
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,950
So this is something that happened before,

97
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:45,020
just not on a public stage
in the United States.

98
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,890
So they are able to get a certain amount
of money already for them and they

99
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:52,130
wanted to get more over here.
That was the whole idea.

100
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,270
And so they brought it over here.
Um,

101
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,970
the permanent of the Namibian
ministry environment,

102
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:03,800
tourism him and basically they're in,
um,

103
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,970
one of the rhino experts in the
country came over and took place.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,180
They were there at the auction
when it took place. So the,

105
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,580
the amount of money that gets raised,

106
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:18,170
it's this enormous amount of
$350,000 in your opinion is low.

107
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,840
It would've probably been much
more if there wasn't, yeah.

108
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,440
Not In the opinion of many, in
fact, low. And I believe, um,

109
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,340
it'll come about again,
but probably in a different way.

110
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,060
And it's going to be at least,
I would say three times higher.

111
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,710
So they're going to do it again.

112
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,900
I don't think they're going to do it
again in the fashion they did though.

113
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,040
Absolutely.
Going to do it again,

114
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,230
but they're not gonna do it in a fashion
they did this time. I don't think.

115
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,140
I can't. I look, I don't speak for
them, so I don't know. But yes,

116
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:47,141
they will continue to auction off these
surplus rhinos and it's not hard to get

117
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:50,300
people to,
to be willing to do this,

118
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:55,301
but in order to get people to spend
$350,000 to save the Rhino just to,

119
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,050
just to donate, to save it without
hunting, it's pretty difficult.

120
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:02,390
I actually think that's
more complicated too,

121
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,150
because in this situation that I was in,

122
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,690
the money had to be proved to go to
the right places to benefit the rhino.

123
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,050
The Path had to be proven to the u s
fish and wildlife for them to grant the

124
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,650
import permit.
So it was went through the process,

125
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:23,030
which was like the most vetted
process possible on every level.

126
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,860
It was the most vetted conservation
hunt probably in history.

127
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,830
And they do these haunts like this
here in the United States all the time.

128
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,510
They auction off dear it's special
deer tags, special elk tags,

129
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:36,220
special sheep tags. Okay. This,

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,280
this year I was an auction where
a mule deer tag went for $385,000.

131
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,250
So they do these all
the time to raise money.

132
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,600
So it's not like a, uh, a new idea.

133
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,190
But in this case it was the most vetted
way for the money to get to the source

134
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,800
that,
and I believe in conservation,

135
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:58,940
I believe in hunting as a means as a
tool to help perpetuate it and keep these

136
00:07:58,941 --> 00:07:59,900
animals alive.

137
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,850
So I had a personal vested
interest in the process,

138
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,523
so it,

139
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,650
and there's other people like me who
feel the same way and they are happy to

140
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:15,560
donate to that. Like you're saying
just to get somebody to do it. Well,

141
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,930
where do I give it to? How do I know
the money's going in the right place?

142
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,040
It's like similar to like,
I dunno if you know about the,

143
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,540
the Red Cross controversy.
Did you see that?

144
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,810
That just came out a couple of
days ago about Haiti that uh,

145
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,690
they millions and millions and millions
of dollars went to Haiti to do,

146
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,310
to help people after, what was
it, the big earthquake they had?

147
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:37,620
Is that what it was? And they
built like five houses. Like they,

148
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,770
they don't even know where
most of fucking money, man.

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,870
It's just a complete fuck fast.

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,310
He'll get this half a billion
dollars spent, six homes built.

151
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,080
Jesus Christ.
Well,

152
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,430
I think that speaks to the point that I
was trying to make and that's obviously

153
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,350
a different scenario. We're talking,
who knows? Who knows what that is?

154
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:58,550
You're looking at, you look at your news
source. Their salon.com is the greatest.

155
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,270
Yeah, very good. Unbiased.
They love everyone equally.

156
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,280
So what did they have to say
about you? Anything mean? Well,

157
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,650
yes, most, most, most everybody
who had an agenda to it,

158
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,650
that was against what the whole process,
what I was doing.

159
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,680
And this goes from all the way from the
head of the US fish and wildlife too,

160
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,780
you know, trying to make, make
it look like sideways. And I,

161
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,120
I you art the world's foremost experts.
Okay.

162
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,470
Especially on those companies.
What does that IUC ends up, um,

163
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,060
group that puts together in the red
list of endangered species. Okay.

164
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,360
They are the foremost experts on this
subject and a guy named Michael Knight

165
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:47,070
heads up that African Rhino specialist
group and he's the foremost expert in the

166
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,780
world on rhinos. Okay. So you got,

167
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,520
you have the world's foremost
experts in this. You had to WWF,

168
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:57,900
a guy named Chris Weaver in Namibia
who heads that up yet WWF behind it,

169
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,380
you got IUC and behind it yet side, he's
behind it. You got us fish and wildlife,

170
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,440
which, you know, I come down on
two different sides with them.

171
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,660
Sometimes I agree with them,
sometimes I don't. Okay.

172
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,550
But in this case I
absolutely agree with them.

173
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,600
So you had like the foremost authorities
in the world all agreeing with this.

174
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,020
And then you have a large amount of people
who type in 75 characters on Twitter

175
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:24,660
and feel better about it. And
you know, they're, they're,

176
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:27,300
they're weighing in and
in today's Day and age,

177
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:32,301
you look at that and it's like a handful
of people who are emotional about

178
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:37,140
something outweigh public.
You know, I mean, the experts
of the world opinion, well,

179
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,630
it'd be,
becomes very controversial first of all,

180
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:44,280
because it went on at the same time as
they were broadcasting another species of

181
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:47,670
rhino that was going extinct.
There was three of them left,

182
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,470
one male to women, and uh, the,

183
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:53,070
the mail wasn't breeding with them
and they were like, this is it.

184
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,270
You're looking at the last three
of these rhinos. Sure. And it also,

185
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,240
part of the reason is it falls into
this category that people called trophy

186
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,050
hunting.

187
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,670
And it's very different than going to
the supermarket and buying meat from an

188
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,110
animal that was killed for meat.

189
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,470
The idea of trophy hunting bothers a
lot of people because they think what

190
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,930
you're doing as you're going over there
and you shooting something to prop up

191
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:20,460
your ego, you shooting something because
you know you want to be the master,

192
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:24,330
you want to go over there and blast this
thing and take a picture of grip and

193
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:26,790
grin and smile.
I think that's like a,

194
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,490
I'm sure throughout
history that's existed,

195
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:33,090
but I don't think that that's a accurate
representation of people who you can

196
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,920
call trophy hunting,
whatever you want. I mean,

197
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:38,580
you can put it on if you're out there
looking for the biggest cow elk because

198
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,720
you want the meat.
All right?

199
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:42,990
And you're being selective about
which one you're picking. Okay.

200
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,350
So if for what the truth about,

201
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,430
let's quote unquote trophy hunting is
you're going out there looking for the

202
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,790
most mature male of the species
that you can find. Okay.

203
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,820
And you're going through a selective
process and I think there is amongst

204
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:03,760
hunters, there's definitely
a movement going. You know,

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,340
Jim and I used to talk about it
all the time. We would go out,

206
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:10,240
we're looking for the oldest male
of the species we can find. Okay?

207
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:11,650
Because that's the best one to take out.

208
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,870
He's already breeded
he's going to go down,

209
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,670
he's going to fall over dead on the
mountain if it's a ram and birds are going

210
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,780
to pick his eyes out while he's alive,
okay?

211
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,040
He's going to go through a horrible death
and we're going to spare that animal

212
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:24,874
that.

213
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,390
And so there's a lot that goes into
that and I understand people say,

214
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:34,190
okay, that's what it is, Joe.
Like for instance, you know,

215
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,230
I just met you today and my idea of
who you are isn't who Joe Rogan is.

216
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,120
The only person that knows who Joe Rogan
is as Joe, I think some of the cable. No,

217
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,110
Jamie knows. Okay, well,
whatever. All right. In reality,
you the only person that,

218
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,010
okay, your thoughts. Okay? My
point is I can't put why you,

219
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,370
the decisions you've got brought
you to where you are right now.

220
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:57,220
I don't know what that is.
Okay. And in this case,

221
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:00,960
I had hundreds of thousands
of people at the soccer.

222
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,240
I had hundreds of thousands
of people trying to say,

223
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,740
you did this for this reason. Right.
They don't know what reason I did it for.

224
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,660
Right. They never talked to me. They
never met me. Okay. And so yeah. Okay.

225
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:17,230
You want to go ahead and lump everybody
in there cause it's easy for you to

226
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,070
disenfranchise them. Well you're,
you're defending yourself here.

227
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:25,000
And I would be defensive
too if I experienced the
kind of barrage of hate that

228
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,170
I've seen leveled your way.

229
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,410
But that's one of the reasons why I
wanted to have you on is give you a chance

230
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:32,140
over, you know, a couple
hours to speak your mind.

231
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,760
And so what people have a problem with
I think is people that want to kill

232
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,530
things and don't eat them.

233
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,640
There's some people that have a problem
with eating meat is some people that

234
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,930
have a problem with eating
fish. Some people, you know,

235
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,520
some people go deep with it,
right?

236
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,660
I think there's varying degrees of
outrage when it comes to people killing

237
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:53,560
animals. But at the top of that list
is what they call trophy hunting.

238
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,210
And that's an,
and that's someone who kills it,

239
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,700
that doesn't have any
intention of eating it.

240
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,140
Have you killed a mature a
mule deer because it has a,

241
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:05,370
an awesome rack and you're still
gonna eat that animal shit.

242
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,900
You're going to donate it. You're gonna do
something with it. Yeah, it's delicious.

243
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,760
And it's, it's, there's a reason
why people hunt them cause they,

244
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:13,840
they taste fantastic. It's high
quality proteins. Great for you.

245
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,990
You're not eating a rhino, right?
Did you eat it? Absolutely.

246
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,440
The first thing you just did it right
there on the spot. Did you? Absolutely.

247
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,570
What does it taste like? It
was better than elephant.
Really? You eat an elephant?

248
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,670
Sure. Whoa. What does that taste
like? Not as good as rhino.

249
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,440
So what part of the rhino do you eat raw?
Well,

250
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,740
we delivered the entire thing
to a whole village. You know,

251
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,980
our group wasn't hungry enough to
eat the entire rhino right there.

252
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,380
I would imagine. How many thousands
of pounds was this thing, by the way?

253
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,810
I guess it was between 20 503,000
would be my guess. Large animal.

254
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,440
And this, uh, did they have
any refrigeration in this
village or is this just a,

255
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,070
you know, to the extent, no,

256
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,710
there was so many people that that
wasn't going to be a large issue.

257
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,240
Yeah. I've seen that before with
an elephant hunt on television.

258
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,010
It was a documentary on the
controversy in um, these, uh,

259
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:11,360
hunting camps in South Africa and they
shot this elephant and donate it to these

260
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:15,110
villagers.
These people came with baskets and stuff,

261
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:20,111
these baskets with elephant meeting and
they cut that entire carcass down to

262
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:23,930
bite size portions or meal size portions
and just a matter of a few hours.

263
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,210
It was insane.
It was crazy to watch.

264
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,430
So when people think of
this being just a waste,

265
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,460
just killing the Santa
wrong, they're wrong. 100%.

266
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,260
That wasn't really discussed at all in
the news that was never covered and never

267
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,760
see one article that covered the fact
that they said it to people. We did.

268
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,270
There's a video of it on CNN. Did
they shut article? Absolutely.

269
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:49,760
Eating of it to the capitol. I got
pictures of it on my phone. There you go.

270
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,090
I'll show you. I believe you 100%
we'll look question. We'll look.

271
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,770
I want to show you.
Okay.

272
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,600
You're sitting across from me right
now and I'm looking at the CNN article.

273
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,710
I don't see any pictures of it. I was
going in the video to the meat delivery.

274
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,940
Just is there a link in there? It
should be. I've got it on my phone,

275
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,220
but for instance,

276
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:14,260
here's me standing in front of the village
of Selfie with the entire rib cages

277
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,390
of that animal.
Whoa.

278
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,980
Let me see. After the black rhino hunt,
a village celebrates meet delivery.

279
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,650
Oh, okay. This is, it is a separate
video other than one that I had watched,

280
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,710
which was the title of that was Texas
Hunter bags is rhino and controversial

281
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:34,610
hunt and then maybe, uh, yeah,

282
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,060
so not so controversial to the people
that you've delivered the meat to.

283
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,910
Absolutely. Not those people,
like if you look at them,

284
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:45,590
they're very excited to get
this protein, um, an elephant.

285
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,101
Yeah.

286
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:51,101
The idea of meet wastage in Africa
isn't that look in the United States,

287
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,750
it's hard for us to comprehend it because
we've got a system of such excess that

288
00:16:56,751 --> 00:17:01,190
the poorest, we'll keep it by the
poorest among us are the most overweight.

289
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,200
You go to Africa, a poor person is
skin and bones. Right. Okay. You know,

290
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,210
people will say the money,
money is the root of all evil.

291
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,030
Poverty's a root of all evil. You go over
there and see it firsthand is horrible.

292
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,790
And so they're not wasting announced
to that meat. Now this, uh,

293
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,200
this animal had been targeted
because it killed one,

294
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,230
a young bull already and it was an older
angry male with not a whole lot of time

295
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:29,620
left. Right? Is that the
idea? That's correct. And it,

296
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,910
I believe it had killed more
than that through its life.

297
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,550
It had been transported
already to this area,

298
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,180
like when it was around 19 years old.

299
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,690
And how old are they live?
I'll look.

300
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,770
I saw list that had been there and
they had them alive in the field,

301
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,200
visited over 37 years old.
Wow.

302
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,820
So you know they leave at least that long.

303
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,650
You're not that old. How old
are you? I'm 36 years old.

304
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,950
How long have you been doing
this big game? Wild hunting.

305
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,670
Then I got into it when I was a strike.

306
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,480
Started guiding Hans
when I was 16 years old.

307
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,120
You started guiding hunts
when you're 16 my first,

308
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,330
my first I graduated high school.
I was guiding hunts through high school.

309
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,550
What kind of hunted Whitetail, like
ducks and the ducks and geese and stuff,

310
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,590
and then I slowly got into hunting. It's
what? It just became a passion to me.

311
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,330
We grew up real,
real poor.

312
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,020
I just laugh all the time when I
see people talk about how, you know,

313
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,500
like I'm some rich over,
you know,

314
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:31,950
super talk about my family in
the oil business and whatnot.

315
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,760
I was already before my,
my brother and my father,

316
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,950
their partner had any success
in the whole business. Man.

317
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,630
I was in my twenties I was, you know, I'd
already charted my path and was going.

318
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,230
I said I wasn't aware of your back when
I was going to ask you that too. Yeah.

319
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,960
Where the fuck did you come up with
$350,000 a lot. Well, you know, luckily,

320
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,010
I mean I've been successful in life and
especially in the Huntington and so I

321
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:55,470
was very successful in guiding hunts
and in setting up punts. That's,

322
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,680
that's how Jim and I got together.
I was booking hunts all around the world.

323
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,110
But anyway,
so I started when I was like,

324
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:06,111
I'm 16 taking people duck and goose
hunting in Texas is obviously a different

325
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:09,730
place. I don't know how much time you
spent in Texas, but hunting Texas. Yeah.

326
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:14,731
Texas hunting and fishing
as it is a part of my,

327
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,980
it's just for the most part
it's very accepted. Okay.

328
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,520
And even if you don't do it,
you have a family member that does,

329
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,890
you've got a buddy that worked
does, and so people are, I mean,

330
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm telling people in Texas
aren't that judgmental really.

331
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,580
I mean about this at least. And so, um,

332
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,900
anyway,
I w w you know,

333
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,520
we're all growing up together as a family
and it's a part of our thing, you know,

334
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:43,510
and my granddad were, I mean, I grew up
in poverty. When I was real young and, uh,

335
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,920
what we had to do was go
hunting and fishing, you know,
and we, we, we got, I mean,

336
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,541
I didn't ever got,

337
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:53,530
I don't think I shot my first deer
till I was 15 or 16 years old. And, um,

338
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,290
so I did this bird hunting and then I
graduated high school and I went and got a

339
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:02,070
job, uh, working for a guy in
Colorado, gotten mountain lion hunts.

340
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,650
And then I, you know, got another,

341
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:08,580
started another business up with floor
tile and made money and I was saving my

342
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:12,350
money up to go hunting. And I met
another guy, a guy named Erin Nielsen.

343
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,320
And Him and I started up a company
together and we started taking people on

344
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:18,720
hunts. We'd say, we'd go on
these different hunts in ourself.

345
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:19,960
We'd go there and find the area,

346
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,150
check it out and go on these adventures
and then come back and get people

347
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:27,080
together and go on more of them.
And it's kind of snowballing so well,

348
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,100
when I met Jim and 2001 or two back then,

349
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,760
um, you know, I was just getting into it.

350
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,240
And I already knew quite a bit,
not already hunted Africa.

351
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:41,610
I'd already gone through a
lot of places in the world.

352
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:45,510
And I'm just got into it and said,
Hey Jim, do you want to go to Africa?

353
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:50,190
And we went and that was his first
African trip. And uh, we went over there,

354
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,290
had a great trip,
filmed it for the video at the time.

355
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,200
He goes on and becomes more
successful and his TV stuff.

356
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,740
I keep doing what what I did.
And then a few, few years later,

357
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:03,940
we came up with this idea to start this
TV show about our lives as professionals

358
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:08,680
in the hunting industry. And we
called it the professionals. And, um,

359
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,590
cause personally Jim and
I would talk about it,

360
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,080
and I'm not gonna speak down about
these people that are at the time on the

361
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,730
outdoor television world,
you know,

362
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,540
which is a different thing than most TV.
And a lot of ways,

363
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,160
I think you've talked about it on your
podcast before. Um, we were like, well,

364
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,830
a lot of these people are calling,
they're saying they're professionals,

365
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,300
but they're getting like a free boat.
You know,

366
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:33,880
we're actually making our
livings doing this, you know,

367
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:37,070
taking people hunting and
outfitting and guiding and whatnot.

368
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:39,990
And we just want to also the quality
of the show. Yeah, true. Yeah.

369
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,490
Shows they're excellent.
They're really well done.

370
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,510
Especially uncharted could easily be
on the discovery channel or the history

371
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:50,470
channel. [inaudible] is a great show.
Yeah. And so that was kind of our goal.

372
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,890
We wanted to chronicle this and make
the production level as high as we could

373
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,440
and, and show people that, you know,

374
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,800
there is a human side of this and
then that's what was our goal.

375
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,550
So do you get frustrated when you watch?
Like there's some reality,

376
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,020
we're not reality shows.

377
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,690
There's some hunting shows that
are on television that you know,

378
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:10,450
are essentially like cable access shows.
I mean,

379
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:13,780
it just really poorly made bad editing,

380
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,290
bad personalities.
I mean that's those guys dream.

381
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,900
I'm not going to say I get frustrated
at it, you know, it's just like,

382
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:24,400
it's just like everybody
who plays baseball not going
to be making manall. Right.

383
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,940
I mean like when people flip through the
channels and they pause him auto shows

384
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,530
and they, that that's their
exposure to hunting. Yeah. I mean,

385
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,800
uh, I don't know that
every single one of them,

386
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:41,800
even ours would be a true representation
of all of hunting. You know what I mean?

387
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:45,930
So it's hard, you know. Um, I feel
like we strive for that. I really,

388
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,620
I mean personally, it,
look, I watched a lot.

389
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:50,440
I don't watch hunting shows because
I lived it, you know what I mean?

390
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:52,860
I really lived it to the fullest.

391
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,570
I've been everywhere I could have
ever dreamed of and seeing everything.

392
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:58,770
So it's hard for me to watch
it. You know, it'd be like you,

393
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,270
you're going outside of all the
fights you've watched him, you know,

394
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:04,000
are you going to get really
excited about watching two bumps?

395
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:08,260
Duke it out in front of the studio?
Unfortunately. Yes. It's so good.

396
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,920
It's so good at what you do.
I like watching little kids
beat each other up. Okay.

397
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,380
Alright. Sorry. As long
as nobody gonna Miss. Um,

398
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,520
but I see your point. I
totally see your point. Um,

399
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,390
so you started out hunting essentially
for food? Well, yeah. Well, no.

400
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:29,080
For it was part, we ate it hard to live
our life, you know? I mean, I grew up,

401
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:32,710
we went hunting. We, we, we shot does
we shock? Well, we ate them. Okay.

402
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,790
We went fishing. We were catching
release and boiling Greece. Right. Okay.

403
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,410
We were catching Krabi and eating them.
That was part of life.

404
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,770
How do you go from that to
shooting an elephant will,

405
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,240
if you really like hunting and you go
over there and you learn more about it,

406
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,320
you know, and you have
a passion for it. You,

407
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,890
if that's what you want to do,
you just go. Right. But what,

408
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,530
what leads you to want
to shoot an elephant?

409
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,530
Like what personally?
Yes.

410
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,970
I just loved hunting.
I love the idea of being out there.

411
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:06,800
I love the idea of
being with local people.

412
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:09,950
I love the idea of seeing
the way it worked in other
parts of the world. I mean,

413
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,960
I had like,
I had a burning,

414
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,310
crazy desire to go experience nature.
Right.

415
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,050
Okay. And, and,

416
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,060
and be a part of the cycle of life in
an intimate way everywhere I could go.

417
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,380
Like people don't realize it, I
don't think. And it's hard, you know,

418
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,720
like I'm really,
and I'll get into it later with you.

419
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,560
I'm really interested to hear
your path that brought you to it.

420
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:35,970
I'm sure you've talked on it and we don't
have to talk on it cause you probably

421
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,910
are right now. It
doesn't bother, you know,

422
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,370
if you've talked about your listeners
get bored of it or whatever,

423
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:45,230
but I'd really like to know it. Okay.
Because you, you, you probably understand,

424
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:48,350
I don't want to like speak for you,
but when you're that close to an animal,

425
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:51,020
when you're within bow range of an animal,

426
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:56,050
it's a different experience than you
have going to seven 11 or whatever.

427
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,260
You're going to have a normal life.

428
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,560
And so in a way that would be
the way I would translate it.

429
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,060
I just wanted to go everywhere I possibly
could and I read everything I possibly

430
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:08,330
could and I learned everything I
possibly could, especially about,

431
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:09,830
I had a real passion for Asia.

432
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,180
I've hunted all over Asia everywhere that
I could go in Asia. I went, you know,

433
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,280
I could, I could go down the
list, do that, astonish you.

434
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,410
And so I went over there and an
Asian hunting has by and large,

435
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:25,420
brutally hard was that, I
mean, I mean we went to Nepal.

436
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:30,200
Europe is almost 17,000 feet. You
know, you walk in, you walk out,

437
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,790
you know, your whole camp is being
carried in or carrying out a lot of times.

438
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:39,320
And if your backpack, honey, you're
carrying everything you live in, you know,

439
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,010
I mean,

440
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,010
I'm 36 years old going on like 86 years
old because of all the diseases and

441
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,490
stuff my body's been through, you
know, for doing IA and all that shit.

442
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,270
I'll never had Giardia,
but I had a,

443
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,660
I had one they couldn't figure
out the Mayo Clinic one time like,

444
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:58,310
and it was killing me. And then
I had malaria had that. Um,

445
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:03,430
I've had numerous other infectious
diseases that were destroying me at 20,

446
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,110
let me think,
was 22 years old.

447
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:10,670
I got malaria and my fever got so bad
that my gums were immediately like a 40

448
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:15,380
year old person. So your gums,
like a fever, damage your guns,

449
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:17,630
like guns, I guess I'm not a
doctor and just what they told me.

450
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,110
But it's what happens to
your gums and oil man.

451
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:24,020
It's something that has to do with high
fever for a long time. I don't know.

452
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,330
So it just like makes your gums recede,
dude. Malaria is a bad deal. Yeah.

453
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,000
I've had a friend who had malaria. Yeah.
And so I didn't catch it until later.

454
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:35,810
Part of the problem is like the medicines
they give you make you feel bad, right?

455
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:39,110
So you don't really notice
it coming on at first.

456
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:42,380
It's almost better in some circumstances
just not to take the prophylactics.

457
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,590
And I'm gonna say anybody should do that.
But personally I do that a lot.

458
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:50,310
And once I just know I'm an
Esol and malaria area and
then you'll know that it's

459
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,640
coming on sooner because by the
time it hit me, I was really sick.

460
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,630
So you're talking about the anti malaria
medication you take before you get it?

461
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,320
Yes.
Yeah.

462
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,650
I had a friend who took that and he
was drinking and apparently you're not

463
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:04,590
supposed to take it and drink.
And he went crazy.

464
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,060
Like he got violent and apparently I'll
personally Laurium the one you take once

465
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,000
a day. It was exactly
what it was. Yeah. Yeah.

466
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,960
It'll make you hallucinate and freak out.

467
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,790
But people hear you say that you
have a passion for it, you know,

468
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:21,700
and that you love being in wildlife
and I understand that. But they,

469
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,410
the big question would be, why not
just go there and see those animals?

470
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,800
Like why would you want to go and kill
an elephant? Like what is, what is it?

471
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,710
What is it about? I, you
know, it's the same thing.

472
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:35,040
It's hard for hard for me to
put it in words, but I mean,

473
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,700
I believe that human beings
are part of the cycle of life.

474
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,560
I believe your eyes or in
the front of your head.

475
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,650
I believe you have canine teeth,
not for eating.

476
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,060
Eating salad sounds good for you though.
It's great. Eat it. Have it out. Okay.

477
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,200
And so I believe that's why you have them.
I believe that we are predators.

478
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,730
I believe it's a part of us.
Right?

479
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:57,810
And so for me to explain something that
is a part of me, it's hard like that.

480
00:27:57,811 --> 00:28:02,100
It's hard for me to say. And, and, and
I think people get caught up in what?

481
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:07,050
You just enjoy the killing it. It's
like you don't, you don't hunt to kill.

482
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,330
It's you killed who have
hunted in a lot of ways.

483
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,620
And I've been on 12 on the hunt
to kill you kill to have hunted.

484
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:17,820
What do you mean by that?
If you're a hunter,

485
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,890
you're going out hunting, you're not going
out killing. If I liked killing things,

486
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:26,340
I'd work at the Chili Chicken plant and
I get 11,000 chickens every day if I

487
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:31,110
really got a thrill out of killing
stuff. Okay. And I've gone on,

488
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,490
I've gone on 12 like hunts that I
went on unsuccessful. She punts.

489
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,470
And those were some of the
best times that I've ever had.

490
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,160
And it wasn't anything about killing the
animal or not killing an animal. Yeah,

491
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:41,994
that's a goal.

492
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,030
But that was kind of part of the
reason that brought me to those places.

493
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,030
You're not going to go to these
places, man, for no reason. Okay?

494
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,000
You're not thinking, when people
think about, you know, Africa,

495
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:55,290
they're thinking about the Masai Mara
and a nice east African or or Kruger park

496
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,910
type photo safari.

497
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,630
You're not going into darkest Africa
on the border of the Congo or in,

498
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:03,390
in the Congo or you know,

499
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:06,060
these are nasty places in the
world to go take pictures.

500
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,810
Most people aren't going to do it.
Not Nice. Even the photo people,

501
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:12,060
you're going to get to
like the raw still the raw,

502
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:15,930
they're going to go and do that stuff.
It's brutal on you. It's not comfortable.

503
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,280
You go out and hang out with, you know,
with pygmies who are very tough people,

504
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:24,060
for instance, who had been to Cameroon
and they're waking up every morning.

505
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:27,750
A lot of them, you know,
their lives are hard. Okay?

506
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:30,610
It's not a nice existence and you
go out there and exist with them.

507
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,200
It's a different thing.
So you,

508
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:38,490
you feel compelled to go to these places.

509
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,770
I would be compelled to
hunt. Absolutely. But an

510
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,550
see people have like if they've
found out you're killing, you know,

511
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:49,030
an antelope or something like that seems
normal. You know, you shooting that,

512
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:51,700
you eat it.
But shooting an elephant to people,

513
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:54,610
they have a hard time with it because
they're intelligent and they're social

514
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:57,870
creatures and they know each
other for they having same mess.

515
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,110
All these animals are
intelligent. Are they really
whitetail deer? They're hunted.

516
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,220
They're really intelligent wolf. Extremely
intelligence are very intelligent.

517
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,940
Yeah. Okay. Look in, in, in,
in a, in a white, in a night,

518
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,180
in eight way to stay alive.
They're very,

519
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,270
they're much more intelligent about their
environment than you and I ever would

520
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,330
because that's their home
and they live in it. So

521
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,240
it's a, it's a different
thing. And elephants, are
they intelligent? Absolutely.

522
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:30,340
Okay. Did they have ethics and emotions?
No, I mean, outside of, you know,

523
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:34,600
Raul is form. I think it, I've been around
animals that I thought were angry. Well,

524
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:37,690
they definitely have emotions, right?
They, they get upset at dead loved ones,

525
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,820
but ethics,
it's a human construct and there you go.

526
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,010
And that's what happens is when people
are trying to apply human constructs to

527
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,810
animals, what right does the antelope
have not to be killed by the Jaguar

528
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,640
are, or I'm sorry, the Leopard
[inaudible] what? Right.

529
00:30:57,641 --> 00:30:59,450
Does it have not to be killed
by the Leopard? I mean it's,

530
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:03,430
it's a part of its life that's,
that makes sense to people.

531
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:05,260
What doesn't make sense as the desire?

532
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:09,400
I think for some people there's a desire
to go over there and shoot beautiful

533
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:13,450
animals. The whitetail deer is beautiful.
It's killed everyday. I agree. Okay.

534
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,230
But it seems normal to people because
it's killed every day because we kill it

535
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:21,160
and we eat an elephant. Seems like
something that you see at the circus.

536
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,160
It seems like something that's in between.
There you go. There's a whole thing.

537
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,940
There's 250,000 elephants
in sub Sahara and Africa.

538
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:31,000
How in danger did that sound to
you? Yeah, that's, I, that's true.

539
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:35,230
I wanted to get to that. But the
car you asked, normal people,

540
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,460
the average person with the
average, um, you know, uh,

541
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,660
exposure to elephants and they think
they're in danger. Okay. Unfortunately,

542
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:46,790
that's not true in south subs. I have
an act for Africa in places like Cjr.

543
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,890
It's true.
They're in trouble.

544
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,930
And in these places sometimes
they actually have to kill
these elephants because

545
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:57,931
they start encroaching and human territory
and was just regulation and control.

546
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:02,800
I know a guy who killed 1200
elephants. Jesus Christ. Okay,

547
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,510
1200 why did he do that?
Population control.

548
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:11,110
So he lives down there. Yeah. Well I
don't even know if he's still alive now.

549
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,680
But anyway, yeah, that was his thing.
He worked for the government killed him.

550
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,690
And when you do this,

551
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,330
you have to spend a considerable amount
of money to kill an elephant, right?

552
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,050
Not necessarily, no. Do you consider
a considerable amount of money?

553
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,780
How much does it cost? I mean, you
can go over there sometimes. I mean,

554
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:28,360
I know people who've shot him for a
couple thousand dollars you could shoot an

555
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:30,880
elephant for a population you're not,
you're not bringing the Tufts, Columbia,

556
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,740
just shooting it and then
the village eating it.

557
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,700
And what do they do with the tusks?
And that would be like on a cow,

558
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:40,400
probably just a female. And population
troll. I mean, the, the least

559
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,760
that I've ever heard of anybody
shooting a bull elephant for, you know,

560
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,850
in recent times, probably like
$8,000, 6,000, 8,000 bucks.

561
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,330
And then the government just keeps the
tongue and the government keeps a Tusk

562
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:52,460
and does what with them? I don't
know. It depends on what, you know,

563
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,780
what did they put them in storage.

564
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:55,380
I don't know exactly what
they do with them then.

565
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,470
That's a weird thing
because of the ivory trade,

566
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,540
like the poaching and the ivory trade.
I mean,

567
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:02,360
that's what we see all the time when
we connect elephants with death.

568
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,980
We see these animals,
they're sawed off tasks and you know,

569
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:11,390
and then the rest was left behind.
That's poachers, criminals,

570
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:17,130
horrible criminals. So if you go
over and you shoot an elephant,

571
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:20,930
it should a bull elephant. You can't
bring the tusks back. Yes, you can.

572
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,950
You can't in certain,

573
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,190
like if you shoot one in South Africa and
Namibia right now, you can import them.

574
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,230
You can absolutely. I thought there was
a ban on importing Henry only and uh,

575
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,530
they, they shut down Zimbabwe
until they changed their structure.

576
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:36,440
It's not because there's not enough
elephants there. They have, you know,

577
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,740
thousands and thousands
of elephants in Tanzania.

578
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,040
They shut down the port for for
different reasons, you know,

579
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,630
with regards to the poaching,
whatnot.

580
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,700
And so the only thing that kills elephants
is rarely lions will kill them. Right.

581
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,140
Um, I taught other than people, other
elephants, other elephants. Yeah.

582
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,200
And so it's one of those apex animals
that if people don't step in and do

583
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:00,680
something about the population,

584
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,580
destroy the habitat and they can get
out of Botswana. Botswana's Trad. Yeah.

585
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,690
Eastern Botswana. It's bad that
they destroyed. It's like a tornado.

586
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:10,270
A lot of places.
I went to a place to,

587
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:13,700
the place that I hunted elephant wasn't
Botswana and it really looked like a

588
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:14,750
hurricane had come through.

589
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,160
It just looked like the whole
landscape was demolished.

590
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,460
And it was just because of
Alpha. Absolutely. You're
dealing with some enormous,

591
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:27,380
I mean, how much is it big
elephant way, you know,

592
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,840
I mean,
well over 10,000 pounds.

593
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:31,760
He was 14 I mean the biggest
one I've probably seen,

594
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:35,360
I would have guessed at 14 foot tall.
It's a huge animal.

595
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:39,020
It's a different experience. Hunting an
elephant. Yeah. I would imagine. You know,

596
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,240
it's a totally different thing and you,

597
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,670
the thing that you have to understand
that there's different reasons to have

598
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,990
different things. Okay. You know,

599
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,190
it's not like a hunting
is some giant just broad

600
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,960
stroke and in, in the
case of elephants, you,

601
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,240
if you want people to,
to have a positive benefit.

602
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:05,910
Local people who really determined
like the survival of any animals,

603
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,700
local people. Okay. You have to put
a positive benefit on it for them.

604
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,760
If it's just living next door to
an elephant, you don't want that.

605
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,240
If it's living next door to align,
you don't want that. Okay. And,

606
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,980
and so you're trying to understand that
you have to give them a reason to keep

607
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:23,900
it there or it's not going to be there.

608
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,650
Did you ever see Louis
Thoreau's documentary on
the hunting camps in Africa?

609
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,160
It's very interesting. It's very good.
If you don't know who Louis throw his,

610
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:38,430
he's a documentary in from the UK and uh,
he,

611
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,500
he really gets very,

612
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:45,501
very thorough on subjects and he spent
a lot of time in this South African

613
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:49,230
hunting camp but it got down
to the end of it and you know,

614
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:54,231
he was pastoring this guy who ran this
camp to the point where the guy said you

615
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:59,850
had done get it Avi guy, he's fucked.
He goes, it's fucked. He goes,

616
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:00,800
they destroy.

617
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,580
The only way she's going to keep
these fucking animals is if there were

618
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,710
something that's been a front page.
I think it was a,

619
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,810
the way you're talking about he was yeah,
but anyway,

620
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,670
it's 100% but that's what he said,
Dude said it has to be worth something.

621
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,230
I look at it like the people in a lot of
people in Western world are looking at

622
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:23,370
it through an a theorial missed and not
getting it. Like if it is, if it pays,

623
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:26,280
it will stay period. Right. If
it pays, it's going to stay.

624
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:30,060
Do you think that part of the problem
with people and their perceptions of

625
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:34,450
hunting is just based on this really weird
insulated world that we live in where

626
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:37,980
you could just go to the store and buy
meat and most people hold on all the vast

627
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,880
majority of hundred
percent let me be clear.

628
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,170
100% that's the problem.
That is the problem.

629
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,000
They knew it and in addition to that,

630
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:53,080
they think that team own and Pumba who
are Disney characters created by a couple

631
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:56,670
of guys and drawing up and
given personalities. My
daughters love them. Okay,

632
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,080
and so did mine. Okay, but
they're not real. Exactly. Okay.

633
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:05,310
The real team own and Puma are out there
fighting for their lives and would eat

634
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:09,150
each other. Okay. All right. That's
the way it works and with eat you,

635
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,150
they would eat you. They
will do anything like, okay,

636
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:16,110
the real animals out there are doing
anything they can to survive. Yeah.

637
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,130
You saw that a woman who's the editor
from game of Thrones got pulled out of her

638
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:24,720
car, so I was like, yeah, fuck,
that's a real lion. That's real line.

639
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:26,730
That's not lion king. That's not, no.

640
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,670
And even if that wasn't a part
situation fenced in. Okay.

641
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,490
Like and not one thing. People don't
like lying is a big deal with me.

642
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,030
I've haunted line been on
many line. Huh? You eat lines,

643
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,550
you don't eat lines in general. Cameron
Hanes was gonna eat align for shot it he,

644
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,310
yeah. Well that do we need a shoe?
If it's fun but it's not the reason.

645
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,900
That's not the reason to go hunting alive.

646
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,920
Well what is the reason to go
hunting line to, in reality,

647
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,830
if you want to keep lines around
and wild areas that aren't parks,

648
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:58,020
you had to have a local benefit for it.

649
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,250
That's the best reason you have to have
some sort of financial incentive for the

650
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:03,150
people in the area.

651
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,180
Financial incentive for people in the
areas and also prevents poachers by hiring

652
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:12,690
rangers. Well or just like for
instance in this black rhino situation,

653
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,320
there wasn't anybody in there gonna rat
out where these black rhinos were at you

654
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:16,650
deal.

655
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:20,820
You go to South Africa and I was actually
hunting in a place the other day that

656
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,760
was in the middle of the Rhino
war. Okay. Well I was there.

657
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:27,390
They killed a poacher the night that
I, one of the nights I was there. Okay.

658
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,620
And it's a real deal.

659
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,540
Those people are having to lie
detector test their staff monthly.

660
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,260
Okay. It's real simple. I saw those
because the staff are, poachers,

661
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,870
their staff are tipping
off poachers. Whoa, okay.

662
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,990
People in the government or tipping
off Hoge is easy deal. Okay.

663
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,900
Well I just saw a white rhino in black
rhino. You've got to keep that in mind.

664
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,560
Okay. Black Rhinos, what you
shot. Yes. And a white rhino,

665
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:55,561
which was brought back from 30 animals
to over 20,000 because of incentivizing

666
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:02,320
people to own them and then being able
to sell them on hunting market. Okay.

667
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,860
And for whatever other reasons,
they were put into private ownership.

668
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,690
They went from 30 animals to
20,000. Wow. Okay. The white rhinos,

669
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,590
very docile and general. Not all
of them. Okay. And they're much,

670
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:19,150
I mean, you would, they're
just easier to be around.

671
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,090
A black rhino has not a lot of
tolerance and while there is,

672
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,590
I mean you saw that on our hunt. It
charged did tried to kill him. Okay.

673
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,450
So anyway,
um,

674
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,690
white rhino are just more dos all
they're going to be hanging around,

675
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:34,780
whatever that's easier for the poachers
to kill and obviously there's more of

676
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:39,190
them, a lot more. And so anyway,

677
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,310
it's just an easy animal for poachers to
get and somebody sees it on the side of

678
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:44,900
the road, they tip off
the local guy. Okay.

679
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:50,070
They were paying between 800 and a
thousand dollars per bullet on the black

680
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:52,690
market to kill these
white rhino or any rhino,

681
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,200
800 to $1,000 per bullet.
That's what a poacher would pay.

682
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:02,240
W what do you mean by per bullet buying
a bullet on the black market to put in

683
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:06,550
this gun and go poach a rhino pow.
They have to pay that much for a bullet.

684
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,010
That's what these people were
paying because they got three 75,

685
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,090
you can't go kill a rhino in general.
This freaking 22. Right. Okay.

686
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:15,550
So to get a three 75 or four 58 bullets,

687
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:17,770
that's what they were paying
two to get that bullet.

688
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,160
So they had to get the bullets through
illegal means as well. Absolutely.

689
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,750
They're criminals.
Right?

690
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,510
It's not like you and I are getting
together and going out there and saying,

691
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:28,980
let's go kill a rhino today. Okay.
And we're going to go get our bullets.

692
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,840
We bought fair and legal here in the
United States or wherever we, Bob.

693
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:37,460
I think another issue, um,
that Louis throw cop, uh,

694
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:41,080
covered in his documentary and that a
lot of people were not aware of is that a

695
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:42,700
lot of the lines,
or excuse me,

696
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:46,180
a lot of the animals in Africa to
being hunted on a regular basis.

697
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:51,400
We're on the verge of extinction just
today, two decades ago, maybe three. Okay.

698
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,170
And when they started
doing those hunting camps,

699
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:56,230
now these animals are thriving and the
reason why they're thriving is because

700
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:59,140
they're worth money and that, that
bothers people. It bothers people.

701
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:02,410
The idea that the only way these
animals are surviving and thriving is if

702
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:05,560
somebody is willing to pay money to go
over there and hunt them because these

703
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:08,200
people who were sitting there looking at
it ain't doing a damn thing to save him,

704
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:09,760
Joe. Okay, they're there.

705
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,360
Saving them to death by making
uneducated comments and throwing up.

706
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:19,290
Just type in 75 characters into Twitter
or your Facebook page isn't saving a

707
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:21,100
rhino.

708
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,900
It's making you feel better and these
people's feelings are in the way of the

709
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:30,040
actual conservation of wildlife to the
people who know how to conserve wildlife.

710
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:34,700
Well, this is something that, for
me as an outsider, who's slowly

711
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,370
ventured into the world of hunting,
I had to learn,

712
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,000
and that's why I kind of sympathize with
the people that are on the outside that

713
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,430
aren't aware of all of this.
When someone says, yeah,

714
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:46,010
I couldn't imagine someone going to
Africa and shooting these animals,

715
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:48,470
it's so fucked up.
I take a deep breath.

716
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,950
I want it to line conversation
defined what you just said,

717
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,970
what screwed up about it?
Well what's they,

718
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,700
their idea is that you're going
over there with blood lust.

719
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:03,170
You're on this orgy of murder over
there gunning down all these different

720
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:07,670
animals and posing with their, their
heads. That's their idea and it's wrong,

721
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,050
but it also,

722
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,080
it doesn't cover the reality of the
money that's involved in paying for those

723
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:17,540
tags and going over there and flying
over there and paying for these hunting

724
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:22,541
camps to stay open as kept these animals
in enormous populations where they were

725
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:26,240
dying off just 20 years ago.
That's a reality.

726
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:30,920
And it's the only reality that we have
documented in Africa right now as far as

727
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:34,970
conservation of a lot of these games,
especially outside the parks. Look, look,

728
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:36,680
a lot of the, a lot of the parks are, are,

729
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:41,681
are spared because they're
surrounded by gay management areas.

730
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,370
Okay.
And hunting areas.

731
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:48,440
And sometimes they have to take those
parks and they have to have either someone

732
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:51,560
come in and minimalize or,
uh,

733
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,490
control the population and kill some of
the animals because they get too high or

734
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:57,440
they have to open them up for hunters.
Yeah.

735
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,900
I guess the best way I
can put this is this.

736
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:05,410
Most everybody would agree that humans
are complicit in the plight of a lot of

737
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:07,970
these animals. Do you agree
with that? Yeah. Okay.

738
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:12,230
Then why shouldn't humans be complicit
in saving them and keeping them around?

739
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,250
Okay.

740
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:18,250
Through a traditional method that has
worked in conservation for hundreds and

741
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,570
hundreds of years. Look, the idea not
to hunt wasn't a part of humanity.

742
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,400
Humanity for just recently, maybe last
couple hundred years into the forefront,

743
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:31,940
maybe the last 30 to 50
years. Okay. It wasn't,

744
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,770
it wasn't nobody thought about it. We're
going hunting. Well before refrigeration,

745
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,640
it was like one of the only one you have
to do on a regular basis. 75 years ago,

746
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:44,960
we were basically an agrarian
society and a lot more ways. Right?

747
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,380
And people looked, they had, if
they're going to have lamb chops,

748
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,720
they're going out there and killing
that lamb right there. Okay.

749
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:53,380
How many people who eat lamb chops today
are going to go out and kill that land?

750
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:57,950
Almost none. And that's where
it gets weird. It's very
weird. And, and to you and I,

751
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,090
I've heard you speak about it
becomes very hypocritical. It is.

752
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,730
It's 100% hypocritical.
It's also wild debt.

753
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,010
The hypocritical is the most common.

754
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,930
It's more common to be hypocritical about
me than it is to not because of this

755
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,910
system that we've set up,
it's very effective.

756
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,450
That allows you to go to any store
any way you want just by me instantly.

757
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:19,040
How long did it become,

758
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,000
how long did it take you
to truly understand martial
arts and everything about

759
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:26,990
it? The long time. And you
still don't know everything.
I know. Okay. But how much,

760
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,040
how many years? I think I was probably
just getting started. About 10 years in.

761
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,033
You look like,

762
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,850
do you, do you think most people would
consider you an expert in martial arts?

763
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,370
If not, I don't know who is. Okay. All
right. And I get paid to do it, so. Okay.

764
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,020
You get paid to do it.
It's your life. All right.

765
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:46,770
So if I was going to ask you a question
about martial arts or a move in martial

766
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,960
arts or what it took you
give me a good answer. Okay.

767
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,500
When it comes to most styles,
styles, I don't know that much about,

768
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,060
then it's no different in
this, look, I've watched,

769
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,210
I can't tell how many fights that
you've done. Okay. That you've,

770
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,580
that you've been color for.
Okay.

771
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,180
And I can sit there and say
this or that or the other,

772
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,390
but to be inside that ring,
I can't imagine what that's like.

773
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,860
So I'm not going to say I know what
it's like to be one of these ultimate

774
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:17,010
athletes. I, I can't
imagine what, that's why.

775
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,350
I can't imagine what you would put
your mind through your family through

776
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,130
everything. It's the exact same
thing with this. All right.

777
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,020
I've done this since I was 16 years old.

778
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,800
Now I'm not an expert on wildlife
management or wildlife biology.

779
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:33,450
I trust experts when it comes to
hunting pretty close to, as you know,

780
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,540
you could ask almost everybody in
the international hunting community.

781
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:41,070
I think they would say the court
knows a lot about it. So it's,

782
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:45,470
you have to be in it to really
understand it. Okay. You, you,

783
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,160
you can't just be from the outside in.

784
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:51,630
And what it comes is there's so much
hate and anger, the lowest hanging fruit,

785
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,550
it's the easiest thing to reach to.

786
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,550
And today we're in a era of
rush to outrage. This technical,

787
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:03,140
technological, social media world as
it's just like a giant boom shipped.

788
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,500
And I think we're still lost
in that. And, and 20 years ago,

789
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:10,190
if I went on a rhino hunt,
nobody would have known about it.

790
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,810
Nobody would have cared about it. They
know hunting exists. Maybe they do,

791
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,940
maybe they don't.
And things went along.

792
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,830
Now the squeakiest wheel gets the grease.
The people who are the most outraged,

793
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:23,130
okay? They talk about
it, they scream about it.

794
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,420
And if you're someone who gets a lot of
attention, like your actor, comedian,

795
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:30,600
whatever,
they are looking at these people,

796
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,690
you know at their comments
and they look at the headline,

797
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,810
they don't look into it any more than
that because we have very short attention

798
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:40,230
span. News now is headline, headline,
headline, headline, headline. Trust me,

799
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:42,420
I know I've been a part of it.
You know this,

800
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,420
I've talked about the black rhino a lot.
It goes away.

801
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:48,660
And if some event came up and come
right back, as soon as it comes up,

802
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:51,420
it's gone again, you know, next.
And for the animal rights people,

803
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:54,540
there'll be somebody who will kill a
dolphin or stab a frog or whatever and

804
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,410
they'll move on to that.

805
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,930
So have you had a debate with anybody
in the animal rights movement?

806
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:04,740
Lots of them. And what was, what
was their take on this when you,

807
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,570
when you try to explain
your point of view,

808
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,500
he tried to explain that this is an
aggressive older male that's not breathing

809
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:11,334
anymore,

810
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:16,290
that had killed at least one young bull
was a danger to the breeding population

811
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,610
of an extinct or endangered rather.
Let me think.

812
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,340
Do they get an animal rights movement?
Like a hardcore,

813
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:27,180
I've talked to a few of them. Okay.
And after they get done talking to me,

814
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:32,110
almost every one of them, you know,
find some middle ground. Okay. Um,

815
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,250
animal welfare,

816
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,890
which was why I would say there's a huge
difference between animal rights and

817
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:38,950
animal welfare, animal welfare,
or I promise you, or you and me,

818
00:47:38,951 --> 00:47:41,950
nobody wants to see an animal mistreated.
Nobody wants to see an animal suffer.

819
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:44,770
We understand that animals
are used for part of human,

820
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,940
human humanity and we probably wouldn't
survive in the world without them the

821
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:53,010
way we do now. Okay. Animal rights as
a total different thing. All right.

822
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,040
To some of those people, it's a
religion. Okay. It's, it is their life.

823
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:01,720
I would agree with you. Okay.
Uh, you know, somebody like
I watched, um, you know,

824
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,700
I really hate that, but there was a
person that you did, uh, uh, uh, uh,

825
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,030
you talked with on Opie and Anthony a
while back who's one of the leaders of

826
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,940
[inaudible]. Yeah. And so he comes
out and says things and you know,

827
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,890
he said a bunch of inflammatory things
towards me and towards anybody else.

828
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:21,670
Right. And it's not, it's not,
it's about his emotion about it.

829
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,720
It's not about if that, if the facts
were helping the black rhinos survive,

830
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:30,340
these people would rather there not be
an interaction with humans and animals.

831
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,610
They think the second of freedom of you
releasing your pet. Okay. Some of them is,

832
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,810
and if it got hit by a
car right over there,

833
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,380
that minute of freedom is better than the
lifetime. It being Joe, Joe Rogan's pet,

834
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,840
they obviously haven't seen my dog.
Okay.

835
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:48,660
And then they lump lump pets
in they lumped pets. Uh,

836
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:51,220
I'm sorry.
They lump animal welfare in with them.

837
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:54,040
They tried to make like that they're
bigger cause they get these animal welfare

838
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:57,130
people and a lot of those
animal welfare people hate that.

839
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,880
They don't want to be lumped in with
them. You know? Cause they know that,

840
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,370
you know,
like Michael J.

841
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,880
Fox said that he didn't look at an ant
in the life of the anti more or less

842
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,430
valuable than the life of his son. You
know? But yeah, he really said that.

843
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,510
Check it out bro. Yeah, but he's got a
disease that Shit's fucking one's brain.

844
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:19,180
Okay. Well I think this was
a long time ago. But anyway,

845
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,150
they say a lot of things like that.
That's an insane thing to say. Okay.

846
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,930
But that's, that's, that's obviously
you're talking about a certain,

847
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,730
that religious side of it, the ideological
side. And the problem they have really,

848
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,760
especially with me is that I had a
gigantic mountain of facts and scientific

849
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,940
material,
wildlife biology on,

850
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,050
on my side of the argument,
I talked with a guy, um,

851
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:49,090
for a different show and they're
doing a documentary on this

852
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,370
show called radio lab. I don't know
if you know, they did love that show.

853
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,540
They did a two hour documentary or I
don't know how long it's going to be.

854
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:57,580
They're doing a huge documentary.

855
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:02,360
One of the guys came over
with me on this hunt and uh,

856
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,340
I talked with this Guy Robert, I don't
know what his last name is. Crow,

857
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:09,280
which or something, you know what I'm
talking about. I know exactly. Okay.

858
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,710
I'm a big fan of that show.
Okay.

859
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,990
So I talked with him at length
last week and a half ago,

860
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,910
90 minute conversation.

861
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,900
And what I found is the more intelligent
the person you have this debate with

862
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,050
the much easier than Betas to have.
And so I,

863
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,920
I talked to him about it. He
didn't get it. He didn't get like,

864
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:34,310
you know what drives
you or me to go hunting.

865
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,390
But he told me I had one
of the best hard arguments,

866
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:43,450
if not the best that he'd ever gone up
against that this placing value on them

867
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,070
is going to keep them around.
At the end of it,

868
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:48,680
at the very end of the
conversation he was like, Corey,

869
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,240
you know you have a really great sense
of honor for this and I really respect it

870
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:57,440
is refreshing and I think you're right.
And so,

871
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:02,060
but it took 90 minutes of going through.
Like I said,

872
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:06,580
that a theorial mist of all the bs
that's out here about the, they factored,

873
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,470
fractured outrage,
manufactured outrage. Okay.

874
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,820
By a lot of times when
people are profiting off of
it, I mean Peta, you know,

875
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,100
killing all these pets, you
know, however many they have,

876
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,010
that's a hard part for people to swallow.
Okay.

877
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,100
Cause they don't know how to tell
people if they don't know the facts.

878
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,760
Well they're killing thousands of pets
a year and they just euthanize them

879
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:29,180
because they can't take care of them. You
know how good their disabilities. Okay,

880
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:34,200
so it's, it's extremely hypocritical. And
how the fuck did they justify that? I'm,

881
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:35,960
there's no kill animal shelters.

882
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,240
I don't understand how they
don't run something like that.

883
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,910
I look spay and neuter your pets.
If all these pets are spayed or neutered,

884
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,070
they ain't gonna be any, any
pets left. Right. Okay. It's,

885
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,190
you're doing,
you're dealing with

886
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,750
almost psychotic level ideological people.

887
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:57,171
You know,

888
00:51:57,171 --> 00:52:01,010
my favorite ones are the people who break
into restaurants and release lobster's

889
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:05,600
back into the ocean.
That's great. You know,

890
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:10,100
I can tell you this for these people
who called up and are called me,

891
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:14,960
sent me messages, threatened to kill my
children, setting to burn my house down.

892
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:18,500
Right? My wife, every single thing
that you could ever imagine. I mean,

893
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:22,070
for those people to say they're going
to do that just in and of itself is

894
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:26,720
ridiculous and hypocritical.
Right? Okay. You're, you're
against killing, but you're,

895
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:31,480
you're willing to kill me. You want to
kill and rape and kill babies. Absolutely.

896
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,980
That had nothing to do with the rhino
at all and nothing to do with it yet.

897
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:38,360
But what my wife haunts my kids on it.
I guess I want to kill him for that.

898
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:42,080
They want to kill them. They look, I'm
mad. It's not about what you're doing.

899
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:45,860
It's about my feelings and my feelings
are more important than what you're doing.

900
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,693
If it's right or wrong,

901
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:50,660
and what they want to do is show you
somehow or another what it's like to be

902
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:54,950
feared or to be in fear.
To be came to my face,

903
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:59,720
Joe and said one thing. How about zero?
Yeah, zero. Yeah. Most people wouldn't.

904
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,420
Okay. And I will sit here and
talk with any of them. Well,

905
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:04,440
I think that's a real problem.
Social media, there were,

906
00:53:04,441 --> 00:53:08,660
the real problem is the anonymity and
the lack of the social consequences.

907
00:53:08,661 --> 00:53:12,110
When if I look at you in the eye and I
say something really fucked up to you and

908
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:15,350
you raise your eyebrows at me like, what
the fuck did you just say? And then we,

909
00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:17,810
I feel that and you feel it and I feel it.

910
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:22,430
But when you just say something mean on
Facebook, it hits that person. You say,

911
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:26,200
I hope your fucking whole family dies
in a fire. You know Ryan's rhinos

912
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,910
are majestic. You go on about your day,
you don't even get a response back.

913
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:33,570
You don't feel anything in that.
That makes them mad too.

914
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:37,380
But I responded to lots of them.
Tweet him. I let other people respond.

915
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,470
I had a bunch of people angry at me
because I went bear hunting and I just

916
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:43,830
retweeted a lot of their shit and like,
you're a bully. You're a bully. You,

917
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:46,530
you sick your fucking followers.
I sick anybody.

918
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,840
You put some shit on the Internet.
I let people know about it.

919
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:53,520
I didn't even say anything. Can I look
at it? Do you, did you, do you feel,

920
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:57,450
and how many people came out after
you about the bear? A lot. A lot.

921
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,930
But I feel like there was a tremendous
amount of ignorance on their part.

922
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:03,900
First of all, because I do eat
bear. People were saying, you know,

923
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:07,140
you're killing it. You're not in
eating it. I absolutely hate it.

924
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,070
I like eating them.

925
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,000
They're delicious and you have to
keep the population down and you also,

926
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:16,170
you're dealing with an animal that kills
the Fonz of all the moves, all the elk,

927
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:18,870
all the deer that live up there.
Your facts are getting in the way.

928
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,400
Their feelings. It's true. Well,

929
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:23,220
it's also what Steve Rinella
has this great phrase.

930
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:28,110
It's called charismatic megafauna and
the anthropomorphication of these animals

931
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:32,400
like Yogi bear and Winnie the Pooh,
they are locked into people's heads.

932
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:36,720
These fucking Disney depictions of
bears are locked in people's heads.

933
00:54:36,721 --> 00:54:41,040
This is what saving the animals to
death. Well, you know what it is is just,

934
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:44,100
it's not doing a damn thing, but getting
to know people, getting riled up.

935
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,440
That's keeping people look, it kept
the contribution for more money going.

936
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,000
You see what I'm saying?
But in California, it's
fucking up a lot of things.

937
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,770
California,

938
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:55,050
these ideas of actually mean California
doesn't even have a fish and game

939
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:59,820
department. Efficient wildlife. Yeah,
well they can call it what they call it,

940
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:00,511
what they call it.

941
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:04,260
It's run by people who are more animal
activists and they are pro hunting.

942
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:08,010
I don't know. I don't have no mountain
lions season here and because of that,

943
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:11,790
there's not a fucking mountain
lions. No, no, no doubt about it.

944
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,010
There's a place called the
home ranch that I hunt out of.

945
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,770
They have one waterhole that
they have a a trail cam on.

946
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,200
They found 16 different mountain lines.

947
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,400
What's imbalanced about what's in
balance about that? There's no balance.

948
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:27,300
That's crazy. These are the guys who work
on the ranch. They don't like it at all.

949
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,730
Not a goddamn thing they can do
unless one of them was threatening,

950
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,720
unless one of them, it takes out
livestock or becomes a threat to people.

951
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,180
They can't do a damn thing about
it and when that does happen,

952
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,330
then they have to fill
out all this paperwork. It
becomes like a huge nightmare.

953
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:40,380
They get investigated.

954
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:45,390
That's why we have a ton of game animals
in Texas and we don't have a ton of

955
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:47,460
mountain lions and
that's how it should be.

956
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,880
It's not like the mountain lion
population is in danger, not any way,

957
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:52,950
shape or form a dare.
Goddamn predators.

958
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:54,540
And they don't give a
fuck about your kids.

959
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:55,980
They don't give a fuck about your mom.

960
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:58,740
They don't give a fuck about anybody
that might have to be on that tray,

961
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:03,420
are not going to have the
predators for ethical treatment of humans.

962
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,340
Yeah. Do you think mountain lions get
tweeted when they kill someone's dog?

963
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:12,600
It's just we're dealing with the
extreme hypocritical situation.

964
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,470
We're dealing with an extreme lack of
knowledge about the subject matter and

965
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:18,210
we're dealing with people's emotions.
And look,

966
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:21,030
I have a lot of compassion for their
emotions. I understand it. Okay.

967
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:25,450
I care about these animals too. They
may not get it. Okay. And to me,

968
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:29,620
I've definitely did everything I could
from a personal standpoint of once I was

969
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,470
involved with a situation,
uh,

970
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:37,480
I went to the more liberal media
outlets to bring it to this. Okay.

971
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:41,410
I could've gone on Fox News and I've been
preaching the choir when I brought CNN

972
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:46,360
with me on the hunt. Yeah, he did.
Okay. So I, I went over there.

973
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,890
I was very,

974
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:52,540
very honest and upfront with them
about everything that I went through.

975
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:57,290
Everything they saw, they came and saw
the entire thing. And so if you, you,

976
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:01,900
if you, that what I've seen is they
got attacked because they said, oh,

977
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:06,010
this was a ridiculous, you know, y'all
were so behind him and involve this man.

978
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,460
That is crap. Well, you know what that is,

979
00:57:07,461 --> 00:57:10,300
is if you don't share the opinions
of the people that oppose it,

980
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:14,530
then you're some sort of a shift.
They did. They did. Yes, absolutely.

981
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,600
Once they get there,
and that's the reality is tuition mean.

982
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,610
I had some conversations with people about
this when this thing went down and uh,

983
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:24,470
I said, look, I'm not going over
there to shoot and rhinos. I'm,

984
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,960
I've no desire to shoot a rhino,

985
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:30,370
but you've got to pay attention to what
you're talking about because you can't

986
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:34,710
just talk shit and say this guy's an
asshole and this didn't like Rhino and

987
00:57:34,711 --> 00:57:35,590
didn't need to be killed.

988
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:40,770
You have to look at it from a balance
perspective objectively with no ideology

989
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:45,070
attached to it. And when you do that,
you realize that there's a lot of people,

990
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,780
a lot of conservationists,

991
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:51,781
a lot of biologists who are pro calling
of certain animals in any population to

992
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:55,900
keep that population healthy. It's,
again, it seems counter intuitive,

993
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,630
but it's important. What seems
counterintuitive about it? Well,

994
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:01,120
it seems counterintuitive to the
people outside looking at it.

995
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:03,100
I'm going to kill an
animal to save the animal.

996
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,950
Let's talk about the term endangered
for a second. You cool with that? Yes.

997
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,793
Okay.

998
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:14,100
Very crude drawing here of Africa and
let's say that if an animal is up here,

999
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:22,180
okay, and then you have or animal down
here, those are two separate populations.

1000
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:26,740
So you'd, you'd made Africa, you cut it
in half, and then I went to south. Okay,

1001
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,250
so are what they consider
East Africa, right? All right.

1002
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,080
If an animal up here is in trouble
and there's tons of them down here,

1003
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,610
you're going to see,
let you know whatever animal it is,

1004
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:44,080
but it was not going to use any
specific on endangered this animal.

1005
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:48,160
The same species is fine. Right?
Okay. Well also because Africa,

1006
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:51,430
it's fucking gigantic. It's
gigantic. If you look at Africa,

1007
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:55,570
this is the United States. Yeah. We've
shown that on top on the set before we've,

1008
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:56,550
we've taken,
um,

1009
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:00,070
an image of the continent of Africa
and you can put everything in there.

1010
00:59:00,071 --> 00:59:04,090
You put China in there, he put the
United States and South America. Yeah.

1011
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,940
Rush is pretty good. I didn't, but
I flew in at crossroads or one time,

1012
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:11,770
nine hours and never left the country.
Whoa. So big ass country. So anyway,

1013
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:17,020
if the animal up here is, it's going
to be on the endangered species list,

1014
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:20,830
even though it's fine down here.
Right. Okay. So for instance, in,

1015
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,070
if you pull

1016
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:26,690
up, go ahead and pull up southwestern
black rhino on Wikipedia.

1017
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,550
Okay. And then I'll kind of walk
you through this a little bit.

1018
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,970
I want to see him pull it up and let's
see if he pulls up the right one.

1019
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:39,830
Southwestern Black Rhino is a
different species. Subspecies. Oh,

1020
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:43,340
okay. So it varies genetically
in some sort of way. Okay.

1021
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,750
Now look right there at the conservation
status of the southwestern black rhino

1022
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,690
conservation status. Okay. What does
that say? Vu threatened their owners.

1023
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:57,560
All vulnerable. Honorable.
Does it not say endangered? No,

1024
00:59:57,561 --> 01:00:02,060
it doesn't say endangered says
vulnerable. What's downs? Wow.

1025
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:06,500
Why is it, wow. Because
it's not endangered in
Namibia. It's not endangered.

1026
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:10,670
It's considered vulnerable. Okay.
Okay. And that's the IUC and list, Bro.

1027
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:15,650
That's the list that everyone looks to
so least concern is the highest level

1028
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,620
less concern is black tail,
white tail deer.

1029
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,570
And then what's NT NT as near threatened,
near threatened.

1030
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,990
So it goes from least concern to news.

1031
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:29,900
That seems like a kind of a
bias designation to begin with.

1032
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:33,740
It's not healthy population isn't even
on the list, it's just not least concern.

1033
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,810
Yeah.
And even when you get into vulnerable,

1034
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,440
you get in there their least concerned
that it's not a concern of going

1035
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,710
endangered. Okay, what's a hell, you
know, healthy population, whatever.

1036
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:45,490
It's not a concern of going in danger,
but it's right next to in danger.

1037
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:47,690
That's the next distinction.
No, he's got lead. No,

1038
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:52,750
it's right next to the threatened
Vu is concerned and lease concern.

1039
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:58,550
Threatened. Extinct. Okay. And then
you have EWS extinct in the wild.

1040
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,340
Uh Huh. Okay. So you have
to get into this. Okay.

1041
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,720
The reason that they're not endangered
on this is because in Namibia has a

1042
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:09,110
surplus amount of them. Okay. In Namibia,

1043
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,830
it's not an endangered situation.
They have a surplus amount. Right.

1044
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,980
When you say surplus, people say,
look, this guy's talking about widgets,

1045
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,340
you're talking about tires, you're
talking about about thing, carburetors.

1046
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,590
You know what I'm saying?
I have a degree in economics,

1047
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:25,070
but you know what I'm saying? Like the
word, the term surplus to a living thing,

1048
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:29,540
it gets people weirded out just at that
7 billion humans or whatever we're at

1049
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,590
are enough of us. There was a
surplus people. Okay, so, so,

1050
01:01:33,591 --> 01:01:38,360
so my point is you get into
that in Namibia, they have
a surplus amount. Okay. So,

1051
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,050
but as a, what is the population? I
think, Oh man, I can't tell you exactly,

1052
01:01:42,051 --> 01:01:46,780
but it's what I believe more than 2000
you know, it'll say on that. Yeah.

1053
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,530
And the black rhinos, the ones that you
hunted or different, or the same as this,

1054
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,930
this particular, that's
the one you hunted. Yeah.

1055
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:56,290
So there's a few thousand
of them. Yeah. Well. Yeah,

1056
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,560
that subspecies in Namibia and is there
other black rhinos is different kinds of

1057
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:03,350
other different subspecies of
black rhinos? Like for instance,

1058
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:05,750
when you were saying the one
that was going extinct in
the one that went extinct,

1059
01:02:05,751 --> 01:02:08,540
there was a western black
rhino that went extinct.

1060
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,300
And what is the difference
in these rhinos?

1061
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:14,690
Like how can they tell the differences
and different techs on many different

1062
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:19,620
things about them? You know, different
versus a black tail? No, no, no, no.

1063
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:22,530
That would be two different species,
but it's like a whole,

1064
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,930
it would be a desert desert
mule deer versus a rocky
mountain mule deer. Oh, okay.

1065
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,890
Something like that.
But like mule deer are weird.

1066
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:33,390
Where the dizzy did designation is
the I five like east of the I five.

1067
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:37,070
It's a black tail west. It's a mule deer.
Yeah, that's another right there there.

1068
01:02:37,071 --> 01:02:39,480
And that they could see right there.
They could be essentially the same.

1069
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:43,380
It's just like this is transferring over.
Right, right. But you, if you shot one,

1070
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:46,710
you would, it would be considered
a mule deer in a specific location.

1071
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,720
If you shot the exact same
animal across the I five it's,

1072
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,260
it'd be a black tea that day.
He's a black telling. Yeah.

1073
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,930
So this is not like that
with these rhinos, it's, no,

1074
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:59,931
you're talking about more
distinct diversity like here,

1075
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:04,500
here, here. Okay. Okay. They're
there total separate populations.

1076
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,660
So they have these animals,

1077
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:11,580
they know that there's a fairly healthy
amount of them and they're trying to

1078
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:16,350
maintain and grow the population right
through the resource of the actual animal

1079
01:03:16,351 --> 01:03:17,460
themselves.
So by,

1080
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:21,930
by auctioning off this big game
hunt and spending $350,000,

1081
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:25,170
they didn't take all this money.
It's accounted for very meticulously.

1082
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,510
It all goes into this conservation fund.

1083
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:31,650
It all pays for what rangers and w
was all sorts of different things.

1084
01:03:31,651 --> 01:03:35,250
It went into the Namibian game products
trust fund and it has a list of these

1085
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:37,650
things. He could pull that up
too. Sure. If you want it to me.

1086
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:41,250
But it's a list of things,
but you're, you're going
through it. Okay. So, you know,

1087
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:44,850
basically it had for the u s fish and
wildlife to allow the importation of it,

1088
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,630
they had to find a non detriment finding
mean that the taking of this animal's

1089
01:03:48,631 --> 01:03:52,350
not detriment to the species. And it
had to have a positive finding as well.

1090
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:56,700
Positive, positive benefit.
Okay. To the species.

1091
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,770
So do you have this animal now? No. Are
you eventually going to get it? Yes.

1092
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:04,410
So they stuffing it for, you
know, it's still in. It's,

1093
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,900
it has to go through a process before
it's important. The United States,

1094
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:09,030
I mean it's only been, I don't
know how long, it's not even,

1095
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:13,670
it's not been a month since I hunted them.
So they take it and they,

1096
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:17,370
they're going to ship it to they yeah.
Tax a derm. No, that'll happen over here.

1097
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:22,290
Okay. And you will just put this in your
house or something like, well, I mean,

1098
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,153
like I said,

1099
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,000
I've said this a lot of times I'll have
to look through it through what the

1100
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:30,120
permit actually allowed me to do is my
personal property. I can't ever sell it.

1101
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:31,750
I can't do stuff like that. Okay. Right.

1102
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:36,030
But what I want to do and you know it
and I'm going to talk to them about this

1103
01:04:36,031 --> 01:04:38,970
once it gets here,
is how can I loan it to different museum,

1104
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:40,950
put it on display at different places.
You know,

1105
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:44,340
to keep an awareness a lot about it.
I never was in this cause I was like,

1106
01:04:44,341 --> 01:04:48,580
oh I can't wait to have a black rhino.
That's not what I was in this for. What,

1107
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,500
what are you in it for?

1108
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:53,160
Like what was your ultimate goal when
you decided to spend that money and take

1109
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:54,790
that trip and shoot that run on what I,

1110
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,810
I have a belief system in
sustainable use as uh, and, and,

1111
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:04,811
and within that hunting as a tool of
sustainable use to keep animals alive.

1112
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:08,550
So did you recognize this
was a high profile situation?

1113
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,700
You would be something that you
would could use as a platform? No,

1114
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:12,840
I now recognize that,
that,

1115
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:16,590
I mean I was told that day when we had
the auction that my name wouldn't come

1116
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:20,250
out for a, it came out like within
a few hours of the auctions,

1117
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,153
somebody tweeted it.

1118
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,420
It wasn't even supposed to be spoke of
right then and then it came out and I

1119
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:30,000
kind of felt to be honest, bullied,
you know, I was like, you know,

1120
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:34,420
I believed in this mud enough to
be a part of it now. Now it's out.

1121
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:38,170
It is what it is. I can't do anything
about it. It wasn't my desire. Okay.

1122
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:41,230
I knew it would eventually
come out and I, I do. No,

1123
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:44,680
I don't think anybody could have expected
what would happen with it. I mean,

1124
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:47,200
I didn't expect to the degree of it,
I've seen other things,

1125
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:50,740
but I'd never seen anything
to this degree. Well, we live
in a new world. You know,

1126
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:52,510
we live in a world of instant,

1127
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,580
instant outrage and instant
reaction to that outrage. You know,

1128
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:01,330
if this had taken place 20 years ago,
you, you really had no recourse, no one,

1129
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:04,420
no one. I mean even if they got upset,
they got upset and they're small groups.

1130
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:06,700
They read the paper together
like someone did you see this?

1131
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,940
This guy shot a rhino. Fuck that guy.
And that'd be the end event. They,

1132
01:06:09,941 --> 01:06:11,250
there was no way to reach out to it.

1133
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:14,740
And now that conversation
is for everybody to see yes.

1134
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,630
For everybody to see everybody join in,

1135
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:18,640
everybody to take the
moral high ground and,

1136
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:23,940
and very few people to take a nuanced
objective look at it and realize,

1137
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:28,990
wow, like there's this a lot of
gray area, like many things in life.

1138
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:31,640
I'll tell you, really interesting
deal. When it first happened,

1139
01:06:31,641 --> 01:06:35,290
some children whose parents
were activists, okay,

1140
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:39,190
they wrote me a letter about
why I was doing this. Okay.

1141
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,320
They told you why you
were doing all they ass.

1142
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,320
They asked me not to do it and
they did this letter. Okay.

1143
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,480
And I did this interview with these kids.

1144
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,620
I had like this guy was doing
a documentary about them
or whatever came down and

1145
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:55,290
asked me if I would talk to them
and their kids, which, you know,

1146
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,120
I understood that and was very nice
and very calm and cool with them.

1147
01:06:58,121 --> 01:07:03,070
I've had been with everybody
really. And, uh, they,

1148
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:08,170
they asked me a lot of questions that were
really, you know, to me, I considered,

1149
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:11,680
you know, most like common knowledge type
questions. But then I asked them this,

1150
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:17,530
I said, if there's three
black rhinos left, okay,

1151
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:23,700
and let's say it's one male or two males
and a cow or whatever and one's killing

1152
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:29,740
the other two,
can you shoot that black rhino?

1153
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,940
Okay, they're going to be gone. You
don't have time to think about it.

1154
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:38,110
This is the moment. Can you kill
that rhino to save the species?

1155
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,540
Okay. And the, the boy, the
older boy kind of got at this,

1156
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:47,230
this is deep in the conversation. This
is after, you know, 30 minutes in,

1157
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:49,990
he was kind of coming around.
Okay. But the girl was,

1158
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:53,640
she was younger and she was pretty much
stuck with it. But I pressed around,

1159
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:55,450
I was like, well, you know, look,
you've asked me all these questions,

1160
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:58,420
I've answered everything.
Can you do this? You know,

1161
01:07:58,421 --> 01:08:00,790
if you really believe in the survival
of these black rhino. And she's like,

1162
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,980
I just don't know.
And I was like,

1163
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:06,990
well that's why we have experts that
do know and that they exist and that

1164
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,820
they're in charge of this.
And so you yourself, Joe,

1165
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,290
could you kill that black rhino?

1166
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:14,920
Would you kill that black rhino
to save the species? Yeah. Okay.

1167
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,370
It just immediately,

1168
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:20,120
immediately just seems like if one of
them is trying to kill the other one and

1169
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:21,160
you're talking about an end,

1170
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:26,210
like it's a pragmatic answer to
a complex question. That's right.

1171
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:29,270
Yeah. I have to do it. You have to do
or you have to let them go extinct.

1172
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,210
Those are your two options. Your options
right now. Yeah, that's it. Okay.

1173
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:35,750
If the one kills the other one,
and who knows if he dies in the process,

1174
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:37,850
cause it's not like the ones got
to let the other one kill him.

1175
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:39,250
They're going to fight.
They're going fight.

1176
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:42,200
You can impale each other
with his fucking horns. Yeah.

1177
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:45,350
They might get infected and die and
they might be the end of it right there.

1178
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:48,840
So that to me, that's it. Look,

1179
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:54,080
albeit extremely over simplified
question to a very complicated thing.

1180
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,041
Right.
Okay.

1181
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:59,150
When you're dealing with these wildlife
experts that put this together.

1182
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,970
That's kind of the question
they're going through.

1183
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,690
I mean that's part of the question,
but it's,

1184
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,540
it's very complicated when you start
putting value on things and trying to

1185
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:13,160
figure out which rhinos, which
you know way, which method,

1186
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:17,510
which place, which community with all
these things. That's the big question.

1187
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,600
What are we going to do to keep these
animals live and unfortunately for these

1188
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:24,164
animals,

1189
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:29,380
they cannot afford the morality of the
average person and the average person

1190
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,150
person's thought process on that.
They can't afford it. Okay. You,

1191
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:38,930
they need experts.
They need money and they need a value.

1192
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:42,460
Anytime you put a hunting license on
something and you put a value on it, okay,

1193
01:09:42,461 --> 01:09:45,380
I'll hunt one time. I don't know man.
The second season of professionals,

1194
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:50,090
we went down to Paraguay and we
went and darted Jaguars. Okay.

1195
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,000
They didn't have going by you say
darted them talking about target,

1196
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:58,250
realizing that rankle lives. Then they
could tag them. So we put collars on them,

1197
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:00,860
radio callers and we moved one.
Okay.

1198
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:06,500
If we moved it to get it out of an area
where it was the threat of being poached

1199
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:08,870
by the local Indian tribe.
Unfortunately,

1200
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:12,560
two weeks later it went back to that
same area and they killed it. Okay.

1201
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:18,290
They're like, we'll give you
the Jaguar hide, but you know,

1202
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:23,000
we want $80 for this color.
Okay. It meant nothing to them.

1203
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:25,280
It had no value on it.

1204
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:30,320
Now had that Jaguar then were 20,000
bucks or anything to their community.

1205
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:35,150
They had done anything in the world to
protect it. It's that simple. I mean,

1206
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:37,880
if you have gold running
around in your back yard,

1207
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:40,310
you're not going to protect it.
It's,

1208
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,640
that's why I have such
a real issue with these,

1209
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,730
with people like not understanding this.
Just imagine this,

1210
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:50,870
this Rhino's horn on the
black market's worth whatever.

1211
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:54,800
It's worth three times a way to gold,
something like that. That's insane. Okay.

1212
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:58,280
All right. Now, now that's
on a black illegal market.

1213
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:03,200
Now if you put a value of it three times
the weight of gold on an illegal market

1214
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:06,320
and you have no value on it and
illegal market, what's going to happen?

1215
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:10,100
I think I'm going to kill it. They're
going to sell illegally. Okay.

1216
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:13,040
Let's talk about, you know, I mean, I
don't know how far I'm going with this,

1217
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:17,850
if it's even in the right direction,
but if you just put a blanket,

1218
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:20,220
no. Okay, how well would that work?

1219
01:11:20,221 --> 01:11:23,760
Like in something like the
keeping people from doing drugs,

1220
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:27,360
how well did it work on
alcohol and the 20th okay.

1221
01:11:27,361 --> 01:11:30,780
Blanket now and then you take enforcement
out of it. How well would it work?

1222
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,660
It doesn't work at all. Okay. In Paraguay,

1223
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:36,420
they had no way to enforce their laws.

1224
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,090
They had no people out in the field
doing it. So what's going to happen?

1225
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:42,930
This is not worth anything and was
going to get poached because there were

1226
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,420
something that they're worse. Well,
those weren't even worth anything.

1227
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:46,410
Nobody's paying them anything for it.

1228
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,710
They were up negative benefit
to the community. They were,

1229
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:53,520
we're worried about our goat. They were
killing goats. They are killing whatever.

1230
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:57,160
So they're killing them just to protect
the lifestyle and their life. Look,

1231
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,260
I mean the idea of death by wild animal
isn't something we deal with here in the

1232
01:12:01,261 --> 01:12:05,220
United States. Rarely. Very rarely, but I
mean, you're not walking down the streets,

1233
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:08,910
la thinking this mount line's going to
fricking rip my head off today, okay?

1234
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:13,911
If you were in like Zambia and you're
rolling down in the evening time in rural

1235
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,460
Zambia, okay? And you're on a bike,

1236
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,510
you're thinking line might be around here,
okay?

1237
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:25,650
And you know people who have been killed
by lion, it's a different thing, okay?

1238
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:29,970
Now let's say you live out
there, Joe, this line's ward.
Nothing too too. You Alive,

1239
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:34,230
okay? Now you go out there, it's
killed some of your livestock,

1240
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:38,010
your property damage. What are you
gonna do? You gonna kill the, okay,

1241
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,520
it's killed your, it's killed your
child. What are you going to do?

1242
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,480
You're going to kill the lion, okay? Now
if you know there's no benefit coming,

1243
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,460
why not poison around here?
It's put some poison in.

1244
01:12:48,461 --> 01:12:52,320
This will kill the whole pride.
And that's what they ended up doing.

1245
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,750
That's exactly what they wound up doing.
A lot of places,

1246
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:59,700
people I think have a
real issue with monetary,

1247
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:02,160
like attaching money,

1248
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:06,980
attaching a monetary value
to life. People have, dude,

1249
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,170
people have a real issue
with lots of things. Joe,

1250
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,990
either people who don't hear the,
the,

1251
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,580
the thing I learned about my situation
was you don't realize how many people

1252
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:19,110
hate you just because whatever
you believe. Okay. You
know, if you're a Christian,

1253
01:13:19,111 --> 01:13:20,970
there's people to hate you. If you're
Muslim, there's people that hate you.

1254
01:13:20,971 --> 01:13:23,190
If you're an atheist, people will
hate you if you're, if you're gay,

1255
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:24,470
there's people that hate
you if you're this desserts.

1256
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,240
They're just not exposed to that level of,
Hey,

1257
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:31,110
I got exposed to the level of hate
that people have for me. Okay.

1258
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:34,650
Back in the day you lived your
life. I live my life. It was more,

1259
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,230
I mean it was almost more of a libertarian
existence because I would never have

1260
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:39,190
anything to do with you.
Right.

1261
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,360
And Today on social media,

1262
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,540
I'm in a room with thousands of people
that hate me anytime I get on it. Okay.

1263
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:51,450
They hated me to the extent my Facebook's
gone, dude, I can't delete it. No,

1264
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,550
I can't get on it.
It won't allow me to get on it.

1265
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:56,210
What do you mean it won't allow me to
get off? I do it right now doing Friday.

1266
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,730
So this is disabled. I put
my, I put my, um, my uh,

1267
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:02,310
email address in there.
It says it doesn't recognize it.

1268
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,350
So that packet the had to have,

1269
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:08,190
did you contact Facebook
through all these things?

1270
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,590
Through their method and then I'm
just like, I'm done with it. You know,

1271
01:14:10,591 --> 01:14:11,620
I couldn't figure out,
I'm done.

1272
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:15,150
I'm not the computer genius or wherever
and I like announce that tons of people

1273
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:17,830
under 20,000 people, you know, and uh,

1274
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:20,140
that were just mainly a
lot of those 100 Biz gone.

1275
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,080
And so they took my boys
out of it right there.

1276
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:26,920
Well that's in a lot of ways it was
good for my family. If you, if you,

1277
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:30,030
if you look at it like these four walls,
like Joe's got to go home.

1278
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:32,890
He's got to be with his kids,
his family, right. Mild mom.

1279
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:36,160
My wife would go on there. They look at
all the hate and it makes them upset.

1280
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:40,150
I mean, I got skin thicker than the rhino
now you could have whoever in the world

1281
01:14:40,151 --> 01:14:44,860
sitting over here telling me whatever.
And I mean because of this. Absolutely.

1282
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:49,750
What was it like when it first started
coming at you? A different story? Yeah,

1283
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:52,900
exactly. Like just a giant rate, you know,

1284
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:57,640
different like raging wall of emotion.
Like I'm angry,

1285
01:14:57,641 --> 01:14:59,770
I'm upset, you know, things like that.

1286
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:04,750
But you realize that what made me feel a
lot better was a lot of the people that

1287
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:07,840
would just say, you know, Karma type
threats. You know, wish you die.

1288
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:08,980
I hope you get cancer,
or whatever.

1289
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:13,000
I would respond to them when they'd send
me those message and nine out of 10,

1290
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:16,390
maybe even more than that, said it was
just a knee jerk reaction, apologize.

1291
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,340
They realize there was a
human on the other side of it.

1292
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:24,380
So you think when they see you on CNN or
they see you on a website and see your

1293
01:15:24,381 --> 01:15:28,310
face, a photograph, they don't
necessarily think of you as a person.

1294
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:32,510
Think of you as an expression of something
that he disagrees with that here's a

1295
01:15:32,511 --> 01:15:36,120
name on something I don't want to.
Hmm.

1296
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:41,470
And you went back and forth to these
people for a few days or how long do I do?

1297
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:45,800
I mean, usually the first message. Really?
Yeah. I mean, I, if I still had it,

1298
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:47,750
I could show you.
How much time did you spend doing that?

1299
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,710
I cared to ever reach out
to Ricky Gervais'. I would,

1300
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:55,190
I love to talk to him about it, you
know? I mean, look, he's a comedian.

1301
01:15:55,191 --> 01:15:58,220
He can probably get it. I
searched his name, you know,
and well, he loves animals.

1302
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,130
Yeah. I search his name and it came
up right underneath Ricky Martin.

1303
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:05,420
It's probably good place for
him. How dare you, I mean,

1304
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:10,010
he's living La Vida loca leave them
alone. Miami. Look, man, look at whatever.

1305
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,940
I'm open minded to it. I honestly, I
think if he was setting here with me,

1306
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:17,330
you've set with him, what would he
say? Well, when I talked to him,

1307
01:16:17,331 --> 01:16:18,860
he didn't have any problem
with what I was doing.

1308
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:23,440
I told him that I hunt for food. I mean,
I don't hunt things that I don't eat. Uh,

1309
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:28,220
and I practice very hard,
make sure that if I shoot something,

1310
01:16:28,221 --> 01:16:32,330
it dies quick. That's very ethical and
there was really not much you could say.

1311
01:16:32,331 --> 01:16:35,870
I don't even know if he's a vegetarian. Is
he a vegetarian? I don't know man. Look,

1312
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:40,100
man, I'm living my life. My kids, Bro.
I understand. Okay. And people online,

1313
01:16:40,101 --> 01:16:42,860
I found out that they had a dog and
I'm like, what do you feed your dog,

1314
01:16:42,861 --> 01:16:46,070
motherfucker? Yeah. What do you
feed your dog? Honestly, Joe,

1315
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,270
if you could bring him here,

1316
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:49,340
if you could get that dude
to come here and sit with me,

1317
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:53,510
I would love nothing more than, than it,
you know, I'll talk to anybody about it.

1318
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:57,140
Do you think that there's like a certain
certain social currency to standing up

1319
01:16:57,141 --> 01:17:00,410
for animals, certain social
currency to taking that photo,

1320
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:04,490
putting online and going? How do you
think, man? I think there is absolutely,

1321
01:17:04,491 --> 01:17:07,160
there is.
I think people do certain things,

1322
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,530
not just because they believe it,

1323
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:12,410
but also they put it out there
because they want everyone to know.

1324
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:16,880
They believe it. Cause it, it jazzes
them up. Honestly, if he was here,

1325
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:21,170
I would show him nothing but love. I
would, I care about him as a human being.

1326
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:25,940
And he know he called me a murdering
scumbag. So he did. Yeah, whatever.

1327
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:29,780
What about the Rhino? You shot a murderer.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

1328
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:34,850
You're like a rhino cop. So look, if he
was here, I'd hug him. I'd be nice to him.

1329
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:37,850
I tell jokes with him. Okay, look, I
understand. Hey listen, here's the thing.

1330
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:42,170
I understand that I was in front of him
as an agenda. He's a comedian. Okay.

1331
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:45,730
And he is a PR is a professional
comedian. Right. Okay.

1332
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:48,380
And he feels passionate about stuff.
Okay.

1333
01:17:48,381 --> 01:17:51,950
He can say what he wants and I'm sure he
can take a joke as good as it can get a

1334
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:56,660
joke. I would hope so. Yes.
Okay, sure. So, so, so I don't
have a problem with that.

1335
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:59,000
I understand that. I was just something
for him to talk about that day.

1336
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:02,000
It doesn't bother me. I don't, I don't
take any of this stuff. You know,

1337
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:03,560
maybe you just have to slap a tad.

1338
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,510
Personally I'd be inhuman to say
I don't take all of it person.

1339
01:18:06,511 --> 01:18:08,000
I think some of the personally,
you know what I mean,

1340
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:13,010
but that's a very healthy approach to it.
That'll definitely help you.

1341
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:14,750
I mean,
what are you going to do?

1342
01:18:14,751 --> 01:18:16,850
I'm going to sit there and look at all
the anger and hate in the world and let

1343
01:18:16,851 --> 01:18:19,280
that change me. If you set with
the devil, you don't change.

1344
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,420
I mean the devil doesn't change.

1345
01:18:20,421 --> 01:18:25,421
You do the consequences of actually
acquiring food or just so much more brutal

1346
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:31,160
than people want to imagine. Um,
chick chicken mcnuggets aside,

1347
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:35,060
even getting grain, you know,
I watched this thing on the,

1348
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,160
the machines that they use to,

1349
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,660
to get corn and wheat from fields. Those
fucking things are brutal. They, they,

1350
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:47,180
they chopped down everything that's
in that field and they catch fons and

1351
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:52,181
rabbits and squirrels and just anything
that gets in front of those wheels just

1352
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:55,130
gets churned up and sliced apart.

1353
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,720
So the only way you're going
to buy grain is you. I mean,

1354
01:18:59,721 --> 01:19:02,720
you're going to buy it in a store
unless you're growing your own grain and

1355
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:07,250
picking it by hand, you're most likely
involve in some sort of animal murder.

1356
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:09,620
You,
whether you want to believe it or not,

1357
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,920
it's the reality of being a human being
and these [inaudible] from who we are

1358
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:20,750
and what we are as regard
to the cycle of life.

1359
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,660
Don't you think they're trying to do
that because they are disconnected by the

1360
01:19:23,661 --> 01:19:26,450
system that they subsistent?
Absolutely.

1361
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,140
I think that was one of the main
reasons why I wanted to get into hunting

1362
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:34,370
because I recognized a big
contradiction and as a comedian,

1363
01:19:34,371 --> 01:19:35,960
as a person thinks about shit a lot,

1364
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:40,010
I look at things that don't make any
sense and I just go, how is this?

1365
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:44,200
How come this doesn't make any sense?
And so many people just accept it. You,

1366
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,310
you just,
you just hit it.

1367
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:50,630
You said as a person who thinks
about things a lot. Okay.

1368
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:55,040
You didn't say a person to reacts to
everything that I see immediately. Okay.

1369
01:19:55,340 --> 01:20:00,140
You have the benefit of time so you
have the benefit of self reflection.

1370
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,030
All right.
You are read about you a little bit.

1371
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:05,390
You said to do the self deprivation
chambers, all these things, right?

1372
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:08,850
You're trying to find out who you are as
a person and you're trying to find out

1373
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:09,690
where you're at as a person.

1374
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:12,750
You're questioning things or question
things that thoughts and feelings and

1375
01:20:12,751 --> 01:20:13,650
emotions you have.

1376
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,400
I don't think by and large a lot of
people that live everyday live have the

1377
01:20:19,861 --> 01:20:22,110
opportunity to do that or take
the opportunity to do that.

1378
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:24,450
I don't think a lot of people do.
I think you're probably right.

1379
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:27,960
And I think there's also the reality
that we're all under the influence of the

1380
01:20:27,961 --> 01:20:30,900
momentum of culture and when cultures,

1381
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:36,020
when cultures is accepts certain types
of behavior and certain types of behavior

1382
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,620
are not prevalent like hunting,

1383
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:42,780
that those types of behaviors that aren't
prevalent get mocked or minimalized or

1384
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:47,030
misunderstood. And that I think
when you, you deal with the,

1385
01:20:47,031 --> 01:20:48,540
the system that we all operate under,

1386
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:52,710
there's a few people that are really
aware of what the system really,

1387
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:54,930
truly is and those are the people
that work in the slaughter houses.

1388
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,490
Those are the people
that breed the cattle.

1389
01:20:56,491 --> 01:21:00,720
Those are the people that work in these
insane confined chicken factories where

1390
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:04,620
they just stuff all these fucking animals
where they've made laws where you're

1391
01:21:04,621 --> 01:21:06,240
not allowed to take photos.

1392
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:10,560
You can go to jail if you work in one of
those plants or if he sneak into one of

1393
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:15,180
those plants and take photos of the
ridiculously inhumane conditions at these

1394
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:16,440
chickens and these pigs,

1395
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:21,300
there's different states have made laws
because it's inconvenient for people to

1396
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:22,134
know the truth.

1397
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:27,200
It's like no different than the outrage
that people had when you couldn't show

1398
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:31,800
coffins when you couldn't show
a American flag draped coffins.

1399
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:35,520
They were putting a ban on them in
the media after the Gulf war started.

1400
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,170
And people were freaking out that like,
look,

1401
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,410
this is my fucking family dying over
there and you're telling me you can't take

1402
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:42,840
a picture of the coffin
that my family is on.

1403
01:21:42,841 --> 01:21:45,600
Cause you don't want people to
know the reality of people dying.

1404
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,660
Well that's insane. It's
information. It's all it is.

1405
01:21:48,661 --> 01:21:51,870
And when they're trying to
keep information from you
in any way, shape or form,

1406
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,630
it's always bad.
Make your own fucking opinions,

1407
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:57,120
devise your own opinion or come up
with your own opinions on things.

1408
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:01,980
But you have to be able to have access
to information to have a really informed

1409
01:22:01,981 --> 01:22:02,231
a paint.

1410
01:22:02,231 --> 01:22:05,850
Well and there's not been a day and age
that I think we've had more access to

1411
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:09,660
information. And it seems like people
would rather get outraged than informed.

1412
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,900
Well it takes a long time to
get informed about this shit.

1413
01:22:12,901 --> 01:22:15,540
And I know people think that
the, you know, I, I agree.

1414
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,280
I agree to be fully informed.
Yes.

1415
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:22,520
You could have watched these CNN stuff
that we did when you had a pretty good

1416
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:27,090
idea, a decent idea. Okay. And then
at least if you read into the article,

1417
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:28,740
you'd know where to go.
Right?

1418
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:30,900
You can know to go to the US fish
and wildlife page and look at it.

1419
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,760
But what happens is,

1420
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:37,590
is people have strong emotions about
it and then they have with, you know,

1421
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:39,040
opinion bias. Right? And I don't know,

1422
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:41,850
I don't agree with that because it
doesn't back up what I believe. Right.

1423
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:46,020
And you can get confirmation bias online
going to a hundred different websites

1424
01:22:46,021 --> 01:22:48,750
that are anti hunting and the anti,

1425
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:53,850
the world's foremost experts agreed on
it. Okay. And like, and, and, and again,

1426
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:57,270
I'm not trying to get away from what
the point you're trying to make is that

1427
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:02,900
people don't have a real idea of the
reality of the machine that feeds us.

1428
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,070
Exactly. Okay. They

1429
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,330
don't have,
they're not,

1430
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,900
they don't understand that they don't
have a personal relationship when they

1431
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:15,901
bite into a quarter pounder with the
cow in the way that my grandmother,

1432
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,500
my great grandmother who ran a dairy,

1433
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:21,070
would they look at a quarter pounded
the way most people would get a potato.

1434
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,240
Okay. And, and the people look,

1435
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:27,520
you know,

1436
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:32,520
just being around you seem pretty open
minded about things that I don't see as

1437
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:35,560
you look at it across to here at the
person that's going to judge me for

1438
01:23:35,561 --> 01:23:36,790
whatever.
Okay.

1439
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:41,680
The people who are judging us about this
by and large are doing it while eating

1440
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:46,120
a hamburger and having a Louis
Vuitton purse. Okay. They're there.

1441
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:49,240
They need to look within
themselves and say,

1442
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:54,241
is the enjoyment that I get from having
this Louis Vuitton purse or eating this

1443
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:59,170
hamburger?
What is different about that enjoyment?

1444
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,950
Then Joe blow gets from shooting a duck.

1445
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:08,230
Okay. He's, he's enjoying hunting.
He's enjoying shooting and Doug. Okay,

1446
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:12,220
you're enjoying, I'm loving this
burger. I'm loving this steak.

1447
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:16,420
I'm loving these shoes. I got, I'm
loving my leather seats, my BMW. Okay.

1448
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:20,920
Is your enjoyment more validated than his?

1449
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:24,800
What's the difference here? It's
a good point. It is a, it's a,

1450
01:24:24,801 --> 01:24:28,490
it is a good point that you will get
people that are absolutely outraged about

1451
01:24:28,491 --> 01:24:31,880
hunting or absolutely outraged
about the death of any animal.

1452
01:24:31,881 --> 01:24:35,870
And yet they're driving down the street
and there's just murdered animal skins

1453
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:40,340
everywhere. You look it on
people's shoes, on people's bodies,

1454
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:44,780
in their cars, in their briefcases. That
briefcase is covered in animal skins.

1455
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:50,140
Every convenience store you stop at as
meat sticks and those fucking ground up

1456
01:24:50,181 --> 01:24:54,770
things that they turn into burritos and
every restaurant, everywhere you look,

1457
01:24:54,771 --> 01:24:56,180
there is no balance.
The hip

1458
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:01,190
I see of it. Okay? Now if
you're 100% real legit, true, d,

1459
01:25:01,191 --> 01:25:02,750
Vegan,
okay,

1460
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:07,400
who makes sure that on the level
of it growing in his backyard,

1461
01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:09,950
he's not affecting any animal's
life other than his house.

1462
01:25:09,951 --> 01:25:14,660
Took them a place that an animal could
live. Okay? So if you're that guy,

1463
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:18,770
I kind of, alright, you know, I can
get you, if you're not that guy,

1464
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,390
then where are you at with
this? Right. Okay. And are,

1465
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:24,590
why do you,

1466
01:25:24,591 --> 01:25:28,220
if you're not going to go over to Africa
or you're not going to go to Asia,

1467
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:33,490
you're not going to go to the third world
and either help fund or personally put

1468
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:38,390
your butt on the ground and live to save
these things and protect these things

1469
01:25:38,391 --> 01:25:42,380
and care about these things and be
intimately involved with their life.

1470
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:47,630
Then what are you doing?
Where were you at with this personally?

1471
01:25:47,631 --> 01:25:50,210
People need to ask themselves
these questions. What,

1472
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:53,090
what value does a black rhino have to you?

1473
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:59,060
It's another interesting aspect that
people get upset if you do enjoy what

1474
01:25:59,061 --> 01:26:01,460
you're doing.
If you enjoy hunting,

1475
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:04,130
if somehow or another you
get some of pleasure out

1476
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,630
of this hunt,
then it's bad.

1477
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:10,870
What they would like you to do is do
it with total somber thinking and very,

1478
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,940
you know, I would say lots of, you know,

1479
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:16,940
I'd say probably the majority
of hunters have absolutely,

1480
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:19,610
at least in a very mean minimal,

1481
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,180
a certain degree of reverence for the
animal and like someone like Jim who,

1482
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:28,040
you know, I have never met anybody
that had more reverence for now. Okay.

1483
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:30,650
And like so,

1484
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:35,690
and I learned a ton from
being around him and he was,

1485
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:40,550
he went to IX extremes and
like we would talk about this,

1486
01:26:40,551 --> 01:26:44,390
we're representing hunters on this
show. Okay. We're representing hunters.

1487
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:50,060
What we're doing, hunters are going to
watch this. Okay. We would talk about how,

1488
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,830
what we thought, how we wouldn't
step over the animal. Okay.

1489
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:59,280
Now you know, look, I mean if it's
down, yeah, it wouldn't step over.

1490
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:03,080
We'd walk around them, we do
everything. We, we care for them.

1491
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:07,430
We'd try to kill them as quickly
and painlessly as possible.

1492
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,030
We talk and learn everything
we could about them.

1493
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:14,540
Why would you not step over them? We
just, we just didn't think it was right.

1494
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:18,530
So you have you had a conversation about
this lots. Yeah. Okay. And like, you know,

1495
01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:22,100
understand like one week when
we cut the cameras are off.

1496
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:25,100
Now we're dealing with that. We're
moving around the animal to cut it apart,

1497
01:27:25,101 --> 01:27:27,290
to queer it right. To take
care of the meat. All right.

1498
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,150
But right now at this moment,

1499
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:34,070
especially the immediate mind animals
taking the life of the animal is taken and

1500
01:27:34,071 --> 01:27:36,770
leading up to it. Like I
said, I sat on the show,

1501
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:40,940
I was emotional after I shot the
rhino. If you, anybody looks at it,

1502
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:44,630
you can go back and look at the Nepal
episodes we did. We went to Nepal,

1503
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:49,340
we hunted with these Naples Lee's Sherpas.
Okay. Who, lots of them were Buddhist.

1504
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:53,510
So you understand Buddhas and a lot of
them didn't want to harm animals. Right?

1505
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,940
And they hunted and they understood it in
a real way. How does that work? If they,

1506
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,870
they, they, they, they're Buddhists.
They, they took people to kill it.

1507
01:28:02,871 --> 01:28:06,890
They were part of it to these PDS,
those people, dude, those people ate it.

1508
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,580
The Buddhist said it, you're on the
side of the mountain, you're surviving.

1509
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:14,270
This is no other options.
Look like they're eat rice or whatever.

1510
01:28:14,271 --> 01:28:17,930
I don't know which one's eight.
What. Okay. But a lot of say in it,

1511
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:21,200
I saw people eating it because he's
just not a lot of options for, yeah,

1512
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:23,810
you're up there and you're living there.
But anyway,

1513
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:27,650
so I'm living with these people.
And these people like you,

1514
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:31,720
you like you have,
you've developed relationships on a hunt.

1515
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:34,760
Would you say the relationship you
develop hunting or any different,

1516
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:38,540
have you noticed anything different about
it? They're very intense. Very, very.

1517
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:40,290
You get a bond,
you understand the serve,

1518
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:44,030
he understand a certain
aspect of a person. Um,

1519
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:48,050
when you see them tested, and
like, especially in mountain hunt,

1520
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:51,470
when you go hiking on these
mountains and you see people pushed,

1521
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:54,710
you see people that are willing to
pussy out. You see people that get,

1522
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,130
get too tired, too quick to
get mentally weak. And you,

1523
01:28:58,370 --> 01:29:01,290
you see people who don't and you see,
you see

1524
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,330
what,
you see,

1525
01:29:03,331 --> 01:29:07,140
what their character is about when they're
pushed on New Year in an endangered

1526
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:12,150
and in a dangerous situation when you
are, um, you're forced to be quiet,

1527
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:14,670
you're forced to be patient,
you're forced to be disciplined.

1528
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:18,210
You find out what someone's made of
because a lot of people are fucked up.

1529
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:22,410
A lot of people were all add it up and
they can't pay attention and they don't

1530
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,630
know how to stay focused.

1531
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:27,960
And be a contributing
factor in a successful hunt.

1532
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:32,880
And that's one of the reasons
why I think men in general,

1533
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:34,840
we have,
um,

1534
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:39,810
an aversion to people who are
loud but aren't saying anything,

1535
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:41,700
call too much attention to themselves,

1536
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:44,400
have a distorted perception
of their own abilities.

1537
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:49,610
I think a lot of that boils down to that
would make a very unsuccessful hunter.

1538
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,080
And I think these things
are ingrained in our DNA.

1539
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:56,850
I think there's a part of
what makes a man a man, um,

1540
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,290
or make some man what makes a man, what,

1541
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,080
what people value in human beings,

1542
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:08,640
what people value and masculine traits.
His ability to hold your own mud,

1543
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:11,730
ability to stay calm under pressure,

1544
01:30:11,731 --> 01:30:15,900
ability to come through when
the chips are on the line.

1545
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:17,110
And I think,
uh,

1546
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:20,760
you learn a lot about someone when you
hunt with them and learn a lot about

1547
01:30:20,761 --> 01:30:22,830
whether or not someone can
keep it together when they're,

1548
01:30:22,831 --> 01:30:25,560
they have the shot lined up
whether they can, you know,

1549
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:30,490
draw back on a seven foot black bear
and, and make the right shot. Yeah.

1550
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:32,310
And so you,
you have

1551
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,630
relationships and different bonds.
Okay.

1552
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:39,550
It's part of like you think about people
hunting, mastodon hunting, whatever. Okay.

1553
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:42,670
Throughout history, thinking about the
Indians. Okay. Think about everything.

1554
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:44,920
Even you know,
Europeans,

1555
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:51,220
there's things that happen on a hunt that
aren't going to happen in daily life.

1556
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:52,090
They're just not.

1557
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:57,090
And especially on a rural wild situation
where you are aware of what's going on

1558
01:30:59,321 --> 01:31:04,321
around you and your actions
have immediate consequences.

1559
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:10,630
Okay. Jim and I had a rule
and Jim, I don't know if Jim
came up with or whatever,

1560
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,400
but we talked about it daily and it was
the five rules, a hunting, safety, safety,

1561
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:20,200
safety, safety, safety. That's
it. W W Aina, successful hunt.

1562
01:31:20,201 --> 01:31:21,940
If somebody breaks her leg or dies,
okay.

1563
01:31:21,941 --> 01:31:24,310
And we know a lot of people who were dead.
Okay?

1564
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:29,940
And we would talk about this
extensively and we'd talk about,

1565
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:35,540
you know, situations that we've been,
when people, we'd see people go, you know,

1566
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:40,480
they would go bad and compounded human
error. You learn a lot about who you are.

1567
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,990
And I've taken tons of people,
Joe, that had never hunted before,

1568
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:47,260
people who are against it, whatever.
I've taken them from all walks of life,

1569
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:50,440
from the wealthiest people
that exist on the planet,

1570
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:52,480
to the poorest people
that exist on a planet.

1571
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:55,780
And once you get out and you go on
that hunt and you're next to it,

1572
01:31:55,781 --> 01:32:00,400
it doesn't matter if you're a mega famous,
does it matter what you are?

1573
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:03,760
You're all on level, ground level.
You're all on the same level.

1574
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:05,410
If you all have packs on,

1575
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,670
you're all equal and it's about what
we're doing and the emotion of that,

1576
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:13,390
that that happens and the bonding,
you know, like for instance, Joe,

1577
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:18,070
if you and I were on the side of the
mountain in Pakistan or Mongolia,

1578
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:21,850
or we'd be at these people
and we're sitting here, we
have these bonds with them,

1579
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:24,280
we're caring about them.
You think about their lives,

1580
01:32:24,281 --> 01:32:26,140
you think about how you
can help them financially.

1581
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:27,820
You think about all these
things, you know, I mean,

1582
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:29,320
you're bringing a lot of money over there.

1583
01:32:29,321 --> 01:32:33,190
You're bringing a lot of just items
like pocket knives and packs and stuff.

1584
01:32:33,191 --> 01:32:34,090
That means a lot to them.

1585
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:37,870
You become personally involved with
these people and you and I become more

1586
01:32:37,871 --> 01:32:40,690
personable and learn about our lives,
learn about things, about our family.

1587
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:43,030
We talk about these things. So we had
the time to do it when we're out there.

1588
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,820
Okay.
And then you,

1589
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:50,440
you find if there's a situation
where you know, like, uh, you know,

1590
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:52,510
you've been in when people can die.
Okay.

1591
01:32:52,511 --> 01:32:56,770
I've been in those situations numerous
times and I've seen people get hurt.

1592
01:32:56,771 --> 01:33:01,330
I've seen all sorts of things. And you,
it's like a real, it's, you're, you're,

1593
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:04,250
you're tied into who we are
as human beings. That in,

1594
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:08,170
in a sense to where a lot of times people
don't understand what that is until

1595
01:33:08,171 --> 01:33:10,120
maybe they're in a car accident,
right?

1596
01:33:10,121 --> 01:33:13,540
They had like a traumatic event
or something. Okay. That's his,

1597
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:18,310
most people probably haven't seen
something die, you know? And so it's,

1598
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:19,900
you know, in real life, you know,

1599
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:22,180
outside maybe they hit a dog or a
squirrel or something, you know,

1600
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,910
or especially your actions that
caused the death of the animal.

1601
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:30,300
You become closer to who you are
and what life really is and life,

1602
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:32,440
I promise you,

1603
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:37,090
becomes more meaningful I
believe because of this.

1604
01:33:37,091 --> 01:33:40,140
I think you put more value on life when
you've been in these situations. I,

1605
01:33:40,141 --> 01:33:43,570
I personally saw the way that I
changed as a human throughout it.

1606
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:48,420
It definitely broadens the spectrum of
what you think our experiences. Yeah.

1607
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:52,720
It gives you a completely different
kind of experience and in a lot of ways.

1608
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:57,430
One of the oddest things that I found
about hunting is a lot of ways it's

1609
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:59,310
psychedelic in that way.
Like the,

1610
01:33:59,311 --> 01:34:03,160
there's something about locking eyes
with an animal that's in the wild that

1611
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:05,410
you're hunting.
You don't,

1612
01:34:05,411 --> 01:34:09,580
you're not thinking about anything other
than that moment and there's this weird

1613
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:14,380
bond that you have with this animal and
when you take that animal and eat it,

1614
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:18,340
there's a strange high that comes from
it and it's not a high like you don't

1615
01:34:18,341 --> 01:34:20,350
know where the fuck you are.
You're drugged up.

1616
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:24,470
There's like an elevated senses sort
of a thing. There's a, there's a,

1617
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:29,500
there's a connection to life itself
that's very unusual and it changes your

1618
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:32,080
perception of life outside of that.
Yeah.

1619
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:34,780
I think for each person it's different,

1620
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:39,550
but I can tell like when you're talking
right now and when you're looking at me

1621
01:34:39,551 --> 01:34:40,450
as you're talking about it,

1622
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:44,260
like you're very in touch
with who you are as a person.

1623
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:49,260
You're very in touch with how these
things have affected you as Joe Rogan or

1624
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:51,610
whoever you,
you know the person you are.

1625
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,960
I think that's one of the best things
about hunting is that when you're out

1626
01:34:58,611 --> 01:35:02,210
there, if it's your family,
if it's your friends, you
know, is largely social thing.

1627
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:05,550
Okay.
Now like in instances like you know,

1628
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:08,930
the extreme cases where people who
like you look throughout history,

1629
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:13,260
Kermit Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt,
okay. Exploring type things.

1630
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,110
A different type of person.
Even Jim is a different type of person.

1631
01:35:16,111 --> 01:35:18,890
The and I totally different type
of person. Okay. When you're,

1632
01:35:18,891 --> 01:35:23,300
you're drawn to these things,
it becomes a real fabric of who you are,

1633
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:26,300
what you're talking about. Just eating
the animal. Everything is spirit.

1634
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:31,330
It's a fabric thing of who you are as a
person and you're in touch with what you

1635
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:36,320
understand that the actions
you took resulted in the
death of a very real thing.

1636
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:40,730
And the death of that really thing real
thing is sustaining year life at that

1637
01:35:40,731 --> 01:35:45,731
point and that societal alive and you're
talking about the emotions you feel and

1638
01:35:45,821 --> 01:35:48,020
that, you know, there's a lot of hunters.

1639
01:35:48,021 --> 01:35:51,860
It wouldn't even get it the
way that you got it. Okay.

1640
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:54,500
Because you've thought about
it, you know, if they just want,

1641
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:56,330
it's just so like it's such a,

1642
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,200
it's such a complex thing and
that's why when people ask me, well,

1643
01:36:00,201 --> 01:36:01,130
how do you feel when you kill it?

1644
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:02,810
How are you going to feel when
you kill this black round?

1645
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:04,550
So important about the
two things that were,

1646
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:07,820
that were most important people is how
I was going to feel about it and the

1647
01:36:07,821 --> 01:36:12,080
money aspects of it. Okay. Like it's
almost like a crime to have money anymore.

1648
01:36:12,081 --> 01:36:14,180
I think. I look at, people look
at money as a negative thing,

1649
01:36:14,181 --> 01:36:18,130
but everybody wants it. I don't,
I'm lost with that. Okay. And,

1650
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,240
and some things I just give
up on trying to understand.

1651
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:24,430
I guess that's the vast majority of people
feel like that. Don't have it. Yeah.

1652
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,700
What it is.
It's almost like,

1653
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:29,640
like looks like someone who
is really beautiful like that.

1654
01:36:29,641 --> 01:36:33,270
Do something negative about it. Like a
beautiful woman has to be stupid. Yeah.

1655
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,590
If you think making money's hard, try
keeping money in this world. Yeah.

1656
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:39,800
It's brutal. Especially if you're
spending $350,000 a kilo right here.

1657
01:36:39,801 --> 01:36:41,390
It goes quick. Exactly.
It goes really quick.

1658
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:46,740
You know your show that you did with Jim
Shockey that uh, uncharted show. Yeah.

1659
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:51,160
I didn't see the professionals but I'm
a big fan of that uncharted show and um,

1660
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:56,990
it was a, it's a really fascinating show
because it got to show a side of you.

1661
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:58,200
Um,
uh,

1662
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:02,930
you don't really see too much of on those
type of shows and the Pakistan episode

1663
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:07,760
in particular where you didn't want to go
to Pakistan, you had been there before.

1664
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,030
It's dangerous as fuck at that time.
It was real dangerous.

1665
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:13,130
Your family didn't want
you going over there.

1666
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:15,950
Nobody wanted me to go on over there
and I'd been over there twice, you know,

1667
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:19,280
and I'd put them, they'd all
live that twice. You know,

1668
01:37:19,281 --> 01:37:23,420
I've been over there like pre drones and
post drones and the mentality of people

1669
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:27,450
were totally different. Really. I
absolutely, drones changed everything.

1670
01:37:27,451 --> 01:37:30,920
John Drones trains everything.
Fuck. Well that's the difference.

1671
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:37,730
I mean we were hunting in
very rural areas. Okay.

1672
01:37:37,731 --> 01:37:41,120
We're hunting with people who,
outside of

1673
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:47,180
the advent of the tractor and a cell
phone live like biblical times. Okay.

1674
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:53,200
There they could not grasp a lot
of the things about our world.

1675
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:56,700
A lot of them think that we
blew up our own towers. Okay.

1676
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:00,810
I mean it's there.
They get a little,

1677
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:04,440
they get media in a different way.
They get information in a different way.

1678
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,290
Their attitude was just very,
very different.

1679
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:08,910
There was a lot of people that were very,

1680
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:14,220
I think it struck a lot of fear
and people and and so it just,

1681
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,050
it was just a totally different thing.

1682
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:21,030
And so to regards to the show is
not going over there on that hunt.

1683
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:26,040
I'd already been there twice. I felt like
an and Brantlyn, you know, Jim's son,

1684
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:30,870
I don't think Jim wanted brand would
to go either. Okay. And you know,

1685
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,550
we had a very real show,
meaning like we did our very,

1686
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:39,540
very best not to contrive too much.
Okay.

1687
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:42,120
There's obviously things like we're
going to just like you and I sit in here,

1688
01:38:42,121 --> 01:38:43,950
I get here, you're like, Hey, I want,
don't want to talk about that too.

1689
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:46,260
Where on the show. Right.
Those types of things. Okay,

1690
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:48,870
we're going to wait till we're
filming. Right. Right. Talk about this.

1691
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:52,470
So anyway,
it was just a,

1692
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:56,490
it was a hard decision because I loved
Jim and I personally didn't have an

1693
01:38:56,491 --> 01:38:59,220
aversion to going there.
Okay.

1694
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:03,480
But at this point I put my family through
hell so much. I couldn't even tell you.

1695
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:06,930
I mean I've been everywhere on this
planet are a lot of the deepest, darkest,

1696
01:39:06,931 --> 01:39:11,340
horrible hell holes you can ever imagine.
And um, I just felt like, you know,

1697
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:16,230
it's not, yeah, I personally thought
I put them through enough. Okay.

1698
01:39:16,231 --> 01:39:18,270
And Brantlyn talking to him.

1699
01:39:18,271 --> 01:39:22,700
Somebody I love is probably my closest
friend and a lot of ways and uh,

1700
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:27,990
I love that guy to death. He, you
know, him and I had talks about it too.

1701
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:31,140
Okay. And He, it was really, you know,

1702
01:39:31,141 --> 01:39:34,140
we did all these shows together and
it was a really big difference because

1703
01:39:34,141 --> 01:39:35,670
Brandon didn't have a
girlfriend or anything.

1704
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:38,460
Most of showed him that
he gets a girlfriend, he's
getting married to now. Dude,

1705
01:39:38,461 --> 01:39:42,720
his attitude change. Sure.
Okay. Like he didn't,

1706
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:46,380
he couldn't get a lot of ways until
you have somebody you're in love with,

1707
01:39:46,381 --> 01:39:50,120
truly in love with or you know,
like have kids like I don't need,

1708
01:39:50,121 --> 01:39:51,360
it's like a human being.

1709
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:53,820
You are before you have kids and after
you have kids in the two different thing.

1710
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:55,920
If you're a true father, a
true parent, you know, your,

1711
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,960
it fundamentally change it to you.
Okay.

1712
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:03,120
So my decisions were getting changed by
this and that's why a big reason why I

1713
01:40:03,121 --> 01:40:05,300
didn't continue to do the show,
you know,

1714
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,470
it's like I done everything
I wanted to do with it.

1715
01:40:07,471 --> 01:40:11,310
I felt like I ran through the finish
line, you know, and am I gonna eat,

1716
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:13,890
run the marathon? You finish. Do
you just going to keep running?

1717
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:18,870
When you guys were up
in, um, way up north,

1718
01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:23,670
when you were on that polar bear hunt
with the Inuits, the local people,

1719
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:28,950
you were a, I mean that was that, that
was a really crazy scenario. I mean,

1720
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:32,460
you guys were essentially watching
them hunt, right? You were with them.

1721
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:34,050
We hunted to you,

1722
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:38,010
hunted to kind didn't show that
that much on the show because,

1723
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:43,070
because a couple of the real reason of
that was the idea of uncharted wasn't to

1724
01:40:44,641 --> 01:40:48,750
do a hunting show in traditional methods
that we just went out and hunted stuff.

1725
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:54,230
The idea of uncharted was to show the
way these wild places work and the people

1726
01:40:54,821 --> 01:40:59,200
who live in them and live off these
animals and their value they put on the

1727
01:40:59,201 --> 01:41:02,680
animal. Okay. And our value
for the whole situation.

1728
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:06,100
And so at that point,
you know,

1729
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:11,590
that show was more about a culture in
a lot of ways that is going away and

1730
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:14,230
hopefully it stays.

1731
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:19,620
So what was the choice was behind the
choice to not show you guys hunting for

1732
01:41:19,661 --> 01:41:20,201
the polar bear?

1733
01:41:20,201 --> 01:41:23,500
Because that was a big question that
I had had and he didn't show any.

1734
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:28,650
Jim explained it really good and a
Facebook post about it and you know,

1735
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:33,630
I think it just, it was more
about that than anything we had.

1736
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:36,850
We had call ladies.
Yes. Extremely intense.

1737
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:42,290
They're amazing people and that's
where Jim's hunted there a lot.

1738
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:45,010
And uh,
those people,

1739
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:49,750
he's like the Michael Jordan to a lot of
those people hunting as a part of their

1740
01:41:49,751 --> 01:41:54,310
culture. Like we would be in the airports
up there and those people love Jim.

1741
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:59,690
Okay. They love Jim. He know who
he is. Absolutely. Absolutely.

1742
01:41:59,691 --> 01:42:04,510
He's hunting rich areas. He won't come
so she, I'll be, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1743
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:09,220
It's up there. It's the most
intense. Okay. They love him.

1744
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,670
Well, it's such a
primitive, I want to say,

1745
01:42:12,671 --> 01:42:15,460
I don't want to say a primitive culture.
I mean it's obviously primitive,

1746
01:42:15,461 --> 01:42:19,720
but it's, it's long. It's to the bone.

1747
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:24,280
It's been around a long time and they've
been doing it this way for a long, long,

1748
01:42:24,281 --> 01:42:26,530
long time,
and there's not much room.

1749
01:42:26,531 --> 01:42:30,640
There's not much wiggle room up there and
not grown any crops. You know, you're,

1750
01:42:30,641 --> 01:42:34,810
you're living in an intensely
cold environments and
there's not a lot of things

1751
01:42:34,811 --> 01:42:37,210
to hunt. And that polar bear
hunt is very important to them.

1752
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:40,900
Extremely and wailing,
wailing more. Most important,

1753
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:45,250
nor wall bowhead seals, all that. They,

1754
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:49,210
everybody wore seals. They
wore a sealed clothes. Wow.

1755
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:53,500
So look,
these things need to be protected.

1756
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:58,180
Those people really get it up there.
Okay. They really get it for their life.

1757
01:42:58,181 --> 01:43:00,610
If they want to get a live their audit,
that's it.

1758
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:03,370
Unless they're going to ship in canned
goods, they do all that. But dude,

1759
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:07,450
it's a value to them. Okay. It's a value.

1760
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:10,030
Just like when we bought that
rhino meat to that village,

1761
01:43:10,031 --> 01:43:12,340
you don't think they valued that?
What does polar bear it tastes like.

1762
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,550
I haven't eaten polar bear. He
didn't need any, I didn't dude.

1763
01:43:15,551 --> 01:43:19,660
It was immediately frozen into a complete
rock. Right. Then just come like,

1764
01:43:19,661 --> 01:43:24,340
it was so cold. It was so cold
and Jim's eight and polar bear,

1765
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:26,380
I think you could ask him.
I didn't,

1766
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:30,070
I didn't get to eat polar bear
because we weren't those guys.

1767
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:33,550
Literally the second
I shot the polar bear,

1768
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:38,260
the guy who was running me running
the hunt was like this hunts over.

1769
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:40,330
We're going home.
Okay.

1770
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:45,040
And we let the polar bear sit there while
we were doing the things we were doing

1771
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:49,910
for the show and dude it frozen into
a complete rock. And we're like, well,

1772
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,270
I mean less than an hour. It's brutal and
we will all, and it was, it was brutal.

1773
01:43:53,271 --> 01:43:57,160
The skin at, at the whole situation.
How did they cut it up? Like a chain?

1774
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:59,330
SARS and no, I mean, yeah,

1775
01:43:59,331 --> 01:44:02,450
but you could still get
in there and hack and get,

1776
01:44:02,451 --> 01:44:07,400
it just wasn't like when you've
dealt with them bear. Wow.

1777
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:11,420
You know, and not be hunted. Bears.
Bears are, you know how bears are. Okay.

1778
01:44:11,421 --> 01:44:15,110
It's just a different situation and other
emotional aspect that people have with

1779
01:44:15,111 --> 01:44:18,710
it. They don't get, it's the
Klondike bar bear. Yeah. Like,

1780
01:44:18,990 --> 01:44:23,990
like I killed this gigantic
brown bear and you know,

1781
01:44:26,151 --> 01:44:30,390
people in Alaska get it by and
large. Okay. They live with a man.

1782
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,730
Understand those bears kill all the other
bears. Right. It's just, it's just a bit,

1783
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:38,530
some people just don't get it.
Tell us

1784
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:41,930
no man,
I don't watch much TV.

1785
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:44,110
That was the television show that was,
um,

1786
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:48,430
it was hosted by the guy from the
Metallica. Oh, okay. Jay had bill,

1787
01:44:48,431 --> 01:44:51,340
he killed a big bear. Well,
he didn't even kill the bear.

1788
01:44:51,341 --> 01:44:52,480
That's what's really crazy.

1789
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:57,840
They had a photo of him and they
use this photo of him standing up.

1790
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:03,490
Like it wasn't him. It was a giant
bear like pull, pull it up, Jamie.

1791
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:07,300
It, they thought that it was
James Hatfield. It's not,

1792
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:10,420
it's another hunter that looks
like, and that hunter, he says, Hey,

1793
01:45:10,421 --> 01:45:14,740
that's my fucking bear. I shot that
bear. Like Hatfield is a hunter.

1794
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,860
He does hunt. I think he's
hunted bear before. Probably has,

1795
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:21,960
but the photo that they use to try to
keep them out of the gloss. Barry, uh,

1796
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:26,230
was that Glasbury music festival?
Glastonbury. Music Festival.

1797
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:30,970
See there's the photo. Yeah. It's not
him. It doesn't look like him there. No.

1798
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:33,280
You know, now that you
look at it that big. No.

1799
01:45:33,281 --> 01:45:36,670
I mean there's a guy who said that it,
you know, he's like, look, that's me.

1800
01:45:36,671 --> 01:45:39,760
That's my fucking bear. I'll tell
you when I hunted it. God Damn,

1801
01:45:39,761 --> 01:45:43,780
that's a big bear. She, what do
you do? You enjoy hunting bear.

1802
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:49,240
I enjoy it. I like to eat them. They
taste good, but the bear hunt itself.

1803
01:45:49,241 --> 01:45:51,640
What do you think?
It's interesting it's,

1804
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:54,430
but the being in the woods with them is
amazing. Have you a hundred brown bear?

1805
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:58,660
No. What'd you Hump Brown bear? I don't
think so because I'm not going to eat him.

1806
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:02,590
Yeah. That's so far to where
my head is. I understand.

1807
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:05,800
Do you understand that innervation
aspect of it? 100% yeah.

1808
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,360
I mean if I lived there,

1809
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:10,870
if I lived on Kodiak island and I
ran cattle or something like that,

1810
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:16,150
I would absolutely hunt them. If
I, for whatever reason, you know,

1811
01:46:16,151 --> 01:46:18,910
needed to be a part of it, I
would absolutely hunt them, but,

1812
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:20,480
and they absolutely should be.

1813
01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:24,620
Would you hunt them to raise
awareness about bears? No. No.

1814
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:28,240
I would talk about it. It's not my job.
If I was a professional hunter, maybe,

1815
01:46:28,241 --> 01:46:30,580
maybe if I was on television.
We'll see.

1816
01:46:30,581 --> 01:46:35,581
That's the interesting thing about it is
the reason we hunt [inaudible] can be a

1817
01:46:35,921 --> 01:46:40,900
lot of different things. No, I
get that. I get that. Um, I mean,

1818
01:46:40,901 --> 01:46:42,610
the reason why I'm asking
a lot of these questions,

1819
01:46:42,611 --> 01:46:46,780
a lot of it is just cause I want to cover
all the bases and take it from a bunch

1820
01:46:46,781 --> 01:46:50,100
of different angles. Uh,
play devil's as much as

1821
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,000
much as possible.

1822
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:56,160
But hunting bears is a very different
thing than hunting whitetail deer.

1823
01:46:56,161 --> 01:46:59,910
When you're hunting whitetail deer, you're
hunting essentially nature's victim.

1824
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,770
I mean these,
these poor bastards,

1825
01:47:01,771 --> 01:47:04,680
they run around and eating berries and
looking left and right and jumping away

1826
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:08,940
and trying to, they're there. They're at
the bottom. It become a science in a way.

1827
01:47:08,941 --> 01:47:12,210
Hunting them. Yeah. To a lot
of people. Yeah. Well, I mean,

1828
01:47:12,211 --> 01:47:15,810
hunting deer is that you're hunting prey.
There's a prey.

1829
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:19,170
When you're hunting a bear, you hang
a predator. Different situation.

1830
01:47:19,171 --> 01:47:21,030
Totally different.
First of all,

1831
01:47:21,031 --> 01:47:25,650
what's creepy about the bears is they
don't make any noise and big fucking

1832
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:27,420
animal.
That was the thing about the rhino.

1833
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:30,300
It was like a cotton ball made no noise.

1834
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,860
We'll freaky 3000 pound car.
Dude, I'm telling you bro.

1835
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,050
It was just like a bear.
It reminded me of a black bear.

1836
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:41,040
They just know how to sneak around. It
was in sandy soil. It made no noise. Wow.

1837
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:44,850
One time we sit down, we're,
we'd walk like, I dunno.

1838
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:48,420
I mean we walked over 20
miles after the Rhino and uh,

1839
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:53,370
this day we had walked about 10 at this
point and like the CNN guy was a big

1840
01:47:53,371 --> 01:47:57,240
dude bro. Okay. It was 200
8,300 pound man, you know,

1841
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:02,420
and he hung in there the first day he
threw up and after seven miles he started

1842
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:06,240
barfing everywhere. He,
but he really wanted to be
involved with it and he got it.

1843
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:10,770
And uh, we sat down, we were
sitting down to the next,

1844
01:48:10,771 --> 01:48:15,360
that rhino 40 yards away that rhino
got up, ran off and we never heard it.

1845
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,510
Wow.
Ran Off.

1846
01:48:18,511 --> 01:48:23,280
You could see where it just ran it
and they just really good at like

1847
01:48:23,281 --> 01:48:26,460
distributing their way. It's their
place, man. I don't know how they do it.

1848
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:27,810
Like I've hunted elephants.

1849
01:48:27,811 --> 01:48:30,150
You would have heard that thing like
you would have seen it for one but you

1850
01:48:30,151 --> 01:48:32,970
would have heard it. You hear them.
Ron, you didn't hear anything.

1851
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:38,100
I he never hear bear unless they want
you to hear him. It's the weirdest thing.

1852
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:42,230
But the reason I asked you about the
brown bear was um, because I believe in,

1853
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:46,260
in the United States of brown bear is
like similar to the situation with the

1854
01:48:46,261 --> 01:48:49,650
lion or some of these different
animals that, you know,

1855
01:48:49,651 --> 01:48:53,590
whatever you're talking about, you
know, certain animals that, you know,

1856
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:57,060
strike things. In North
America it's probably the
closest thing we got, you know,

1857
01:48:57,150 --> 01:49:00,170
to that would be the brown
bear. Yeah. You know, and,

1858
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:02,490
and they're hunted a lot.

1859
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:07,830
People get it by and large and I in tune,
I guess to a lesser extent,

1860
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,170
by and large, people don't
have as big a problem with it,

1861
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:14,820
I think as they would African animals.
I don't know. I don't know why it, yeah.

1862
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:15,841
I mean,

1863
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:18,810
there's a lot of people that have a really
hard time around the power of course.

1864
01:49:18,811 --> 01:49:21,010
But there's a lot of people that
don't. I mean, you look at, you know,

1865
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:23,590
even people who hunt, oh, there's
a lot of people in North America,

1866
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:26,400
North America's, I'd never go to
Africa. You see what I'm saying?

1867
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:31,010
So even amongst hunters,
you know? Yeah. I think a,

1868
01:49:31,090 --> 01:49:34,050
it changes the distinction whether or
not you're hunting something you're going

1869
01:49:34,051 --> 01:49:38,370
to eat or not. And you can eat brown
bear, but not that many people do know.

1870
01:49:38,371 --> 01:49:41,950
It's a management choice. What does it
taste like? Have you ever eaten it? I've,

1871
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:46,870
I've only shot one and I hadn't needed,
it was eating a rotten sea line, let's,

1872
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:49,210
and stuff that's gonna
make it pretty rough.

1873
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:54,750
It had the ad eight the head
off of a giant rotting sea lion.

1874
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,460
It was a picture.
Sure.

1875
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:02,710
It would smell and taste probably
a lot like it, dude. It was,

1876
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:06,040
it was an extremely,
um,

1877
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,670
extremely smelly odor,

1878
01:50:10,630 --> 01:50:15,460
like rough, nasty situation.
It was really gross smelling.

1879
01:50:15,461 --> 01:50:18,820
You know, for many people don't know.
One of the most delicious meats.

1880
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:21,760
Apparently his black bear
that's been eating blueberries,

1881
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:28,990
blackberries. Oh God. Just ate the
whole head off that thing. Huh?

1882
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:32,850
That bear had claim, that
thing that's, it was there.

1883
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:36,430
It was laying right on top of it.
Where was this? That was on unit,

1884
01:50:36,431 --> 01:50:39,340
Mac Island in Alaska.
Way Out in the Alaskan peninsula.

1885
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:44,460
And that bear had just was just laying
on it and I flew in out there and there's

1886
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:46,390
a guide who set up the camp,
you know,

1887
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:49,660
and we flew in and he hadn't been
there that long and I was just like,

1888
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,170
well do you, what do you think about that
bear? Have you seen it? He's like, no,

1889
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:56,060
I think it's big. I was like, well
why do you think it's big? He say,

1890
01:50:56,061 --> 01:50:58,780
cause I've seen six other bears come
up to that cliff and look down and turn

1891
01:50:58,781 --> 01:51:03,160
around and leave it like it was his,
wow.

1892
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:07,510
This show was interesting that showed
the hunt because it was one of the few

1893
01:51:07,511 --> 01:51:10,650
shows that I've ever seen on
television that, you know,

1894
01:51:10,651 --> 01:51:14,110
like you give a lot of these subsistence
living shows, you know, like Alaska,

1895
01:51:14,111 --> 01:51:18,820
the last frontier or life below zero.
But this wasn't about subsistence at all.

1896
01:51:18,821 --> 01:51:22,510
It was about hunting to control
the populations in trophy hunting.

1897
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:23,800
I mean that's what
these people were doing.

1898
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:26,950
I mean they did he cook up
some backstraps on one episode.

1899
01:51:26,951 --> 01:51:31,150
Some people sliced up some, I don't get
like the whole thing about, like you said,

1900
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:33,980
they go there in these camps,
just a trophy hunt.

1901
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:36,280
The animals aren't getting
wasted. Right. Okay.

1902
01:51:36,281 --> 01:51:40,150
You're getting into what's drawing a
person out there to benefit regardless of

1903
01:51:40,151 --> 01:51:42,640
why he's there and his
mind, whatever it is. Okay.

1904
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:45,910
If the result is good and
the result is benefiting it,

1905
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:50,950
who you're judging his desires to do
something on what going on in your head,

1906
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:53,410
you're not, you're not
looking at the result. Well,

1907
01:51:53,411 --> 01:51:57,620
you say that the meat doesn't get wasted
if you leave it around [inaudible]

1908
01:51:58,290 --> 01:52:01,270
brown bear, Brown bear. Okay.
The other animals eat it.

1909
01:52:01,271 --> 01:52:04,660
Whatever bears the biggest Predator of
other bears and barely eat them. Yeah,

1910
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:09,640
they're all cannibals. But I'm saying
like by and large, throughout hunting,

1911
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:13,960
there was only a few animals that
don't get eaten. Okay. You know,

1912
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:18,110
like I said [inaudible] I
have shot some high end,

1913
01:52:18,111 --> 01:52:22,480
I wouldn't need hyena baboons.
My brother ate the lungs of about boom.

1914
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:25,780
Whoa. On a bet. No,

1915
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:29,440
cause he was hungry really well and that's
what the locals written. He thought,

1916
01:52:29,441 --> 01:52:31,330
well, if I'm gonna eat a part of it,
I'm going to eat their favorite part.

1917
01:52:31,331 --> 01:52:35,500
And it was the lungs. The locals like
the lungs. Huh? They boiled them up.

1918
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:41,200
What do you say it is? Like he didn't,
they didn't act like it was too good.

1919
01:52:41,201 --> 01:52:42,220
I mean,
I didn't get into it.

1920
01:52:42,221 --> 01:52:45,090
We were in Central African Republic
in the middle of, you know,

1921
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:46,570
the people in before the beat.

1922
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:51,140
They just got the camp back
from the chatty and rebels
and shot it up. You know,

1923
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:54,950
it was that, we weren't really
talking about stuff like
that. God, Bob Boone Long.

1924
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:58,640
What is the nastiest thing you have eaten
when you've been hungry on these camps?

1925
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:04,040
Have you ever eaten an animal that
you regretted? No, but I mean,

1926
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:08,120
I've eaten things that weren't like, like,
like you said about the elephant Dubai.

1927
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:10,190
By the time we shot the
elephant, we were hungry. I mean,

1928
01:53:10,191 --> 01:53:12,320
we just threw it on coals and
we're just eat it right there.

1929
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:15,590
And it wasn't nasty or anything.
It was food. But you know,

1930
01:53:15,591 --> 01:53:17,360
I haven't really gotten into
something like, you know,

1931
01:53:17,361 --> 01:53:19,940
Jim eats that ego knuck okay.
Which is,

1932
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:24,570
it's like fermented Walrus meat.
Oh yeah.

1933
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:27,880
Like the Icelandic people doing sharks.
Yeah.

1934
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:33,020
They just leave it out there and a ball.
Yeah. I haven't tried that, you know,

1935
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,530
but I would try it.
I mean,

1936
01:53:36,531 --> 01:53:40,760
I've watched Jimmy a lot of crazy
crap that he's living a very odd life.

1937
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:45,080
Jim Shock. No doubt. I mean, uh, and I
say that with all due respect, it's not,

1938
01:53:45,081 --> 01:53:49,820
I'm not saying it in a negative way if,
if you don't know, show just, I mean,

1939
01:53:49,821 --> 01:53:51,950
even if you're not in a hunting
at all, like, like you said,

1940
01:53:51,951 --> 01:53:54,800
that shows not really necessarily
about hunting that much. I mean, it is,

1941
01:53:54,801 --> 01:53:56,330
but it isn't, it's a lot of, it is a,

1942
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:01,010
it's an in depth discovery of the cultures
that he's visiting and the emotions

1943
01:54:01,011 --> 01:54:02,900
that we like we would go
through on the hunt. I mean,

1944
01:54:02,901 --> 01:54:04,130
I'll cry it on the show twice.

1945
01:54:04,131 --> 01:54:08,480
A man I cried when I shot a previously
on the professionals when I shot a blue

1946
01:54:08,481 --> 01:54:09,980
sheet. And just because
it was just, you know,

1947
01:54:09,981 --> 01:54:14,630
we had a lot real ordeal and it was
just like a relief and emotional thing.

1948
01:54:14,631 --> 01:54:18,560
And then I cried talking about my granddad
one time and that was the Pakistan.

1949
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:22,610
Yeah. So, yeah. And so it just,
like, we were very real about it.

1950
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:26,960
We were everything on our sleeve.
And what is he trying to do?

1951
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:29,990
Go into all these different, just soaking
up a lot of different experiences.

1952
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,900
Is that his, uh, his
perspective on this? I mean,

1953
01:54:32,901 --> 01:54:36,020
you'd have to talk to him about it
and I don't even know if he would,

1954
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:41,480
you know, I love the Guy, I've
been with him a lot and you know,

1955
01:54:41,570 --> 01:54:46,570
a lot of our life was connected for
over a decade and still is in a way.

1956
01:54:47,330 --> 01:54:50,900
Um,
and he's just,

1957
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:55,340
he has a different attitude about it.

1958
01:54:55,370 --> 01:55:00,370
Almost like I would say some of the
explorers might've had in his mind.

1959
01:55:02,001 --> 01:55:04,970
I'm not saying that he has any delusions
of grandeur that that's what he's doing,

1960
01:55:04,971 --> 01:55:08,840
but he has a different attitude
about it. And I think, you know,

1961
01:55:08,841 --> 01:55:11,090
we both wanted to see
what's left. Like, I mean,

1962
01:55:11,091 --> 01:55:14,400
when you're going to Papa New Guinea or
going to the edge when you're going in

1963
01:55:14,401 --> 01:55:14,991
the rural,
I mean,

1964
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:18,980
we're dealing with people
who were cannibals and
believe in witchcraft and all

1965
01:55:18,981 --> 01:55:23,220
sorts of stuff, you know, and I like
hanging out with cannibals. I mean,

1966
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:25,310
look,
I shouldn't put,

1967
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:28,940
I didn't deal with a cannibal who I
deal with people who knew cannibals and

1968
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:33,710
understood cannibalism and we're,
we're afraid of it.

1969
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:38,780
So they knew people. I knew, knew
it to be, they knew it to be new,

1970
01:55:38,781 --> 01:55:42,320
it to be a real thing.
Okay. And like for instance,

1971
01:55:42,321 --> 01:55:47,321
one time I was hunting in Uganda and we
talk about people's different attitudes

1972
01:55:48,781 --> 01:55:52,230
and stuff. Jim and I went to Uganda and
one of the first hunts when it reopened,

1973
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:55,620
we're hunting animal called CECI islands
that have tongue. What's it called?

1974
01:55:55,860 --> 01:56:00,860
CECI island sit at Tanga with is that
it's an antelope that lives in a swamp on

1975
01:56:01,301 --> 01:56:05,460
an island. Okay. And
like mean we value it.

1976
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:07,410
We love it.
But anyway,

1977
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:13,140
so we're over there and they were talking
about this big problem they had with

1978
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:18,320
over in a certain area of Uganda on
Lake Albert were that they were buying

1979
01:56:19,290 --> 01:56:23,450
bushmeat from the Congolese,
just basically almost
like from a grocery story.

1980
01:56:23,451 --> 01:56:26,280
We'd come across on a boat,
it would all be cut up and everything.

1981
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:30,570
And the way they got the people
to quit it was, they said,

1982
01:56:30,571 --> 01:56:32,880
the con Congolese are still
on your human meat too.

1983
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:37,710
And they believed it.
Well,

1984
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,830
vice did this piece on Liberia and uh,

1985
01:56:40,831 --> 01:56:42,960
that was a real issue in Liberia.

1986
01:56:42,961 --> 01:56:47,961
They were selling human meat and these
food carts on the corner and this guy

1987
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:52,290
recognized it as human meat because
he'd eating human meat. Yeah,

1988
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:57,960
there you go. What, what the fuck?
That's, that's the difference between,

1989
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:02,300
you know, the, it's a dis
Sherman oaks. It's a d,

1990
01:57:02,301 --> 01:57:05,910
it's the disconnect of what is really
happening. You when you think about it,

1991
01:57:05,911 --> 01:57:08,540
think about this, think about
like this war we have, you know,

1992
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:12,750
going on versus Isis, right. And
we're sitting over here and you know,

1993
01:57:13,470 --> 01:57:17,340
I've been close back, you know,
to Al Qaeda and stuff like that,

1994
01:57:17,341 --> 01:57:20,780
when I would go to that part of the
world. Okay. I've been, you know,

1995
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,330
on the border of Afghanistan and
probably in it and didn't know it. Okay.

1996
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:28,830
For sure. And, and it's
just, it's a huge disconnect.

1997
01:57:28,831 --> 01:57:33,831
If you were over there and you see them
selling 12 year old girls naked in a

1998
01:57:34,681 --> 01:57:38,670
bizarre and having an auction in Syria
where they're just selling them as

1999
01:57:38,671 --> 01:57:42,930
property for sexual abuse, whatever,
sex late, and it's just there,

2000
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:45,480
they've kidnapped him. That's what
they're doing. You're going to have,

2001
01:57:45,481 --> 01:57:49,380
if you saw that going down who isn't going
to be like immediately want this stop.

2002
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:52,680
Okay. It's know that you're going
to, it's gone. You're going to do it.

2003
01:57:52,681 --> 01:57:56,110
I mean it's just the different mindset.
I mean that we have,

2004
01:57:56,111 --> 01:57:59,160
and I'm not saying that people want that
to continue in any way, shape or form,

2005
01:57:59,161 --> 01:58:01,920
but if you saw it you'd feel
differently about it. No doubt.

2006
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:07,340
Well there's definitely different ways
of living in this age in 2015 and there's

2007
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:13,190
some ways that people are living everyday
just to get by that would horrify most

2008
01:58:13,531 --> 01:58:17,620
people and what they consider normal,
what they consider normal. Yeah.

2009
01:58:17,621 --> 01:58:21,000
What is normal? Our normal
versus their normal. Yeah.

2010
01:58:21,001 --> 01:58:26,001
Normal up the fly river and Papa New
Guinea is far different than here.

2011
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:32,610
Normal in a pygmy village in Cameroon
as far different. You're talking about,

2012
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,170
you know like you talk about recreational
drug use. Okay. In Papa New Guinea.

2013
01:58:37,171 --> 01:58:41,170
They do this thing called
boo or boo way and it's like,

2014
01:58:41,171 --> 01:58:42,280
I don't know exactly what it is,

2015
01:58:42,281 --> 01:58:44,680
but they take lime and they take something
else they put in their mouth and it

2016
01:58:44,681 --> 01:58:46,510
has a reaction.
It's like a low grade myth.

2017
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:52,140
People from this big all the way up to
grown people on it their entire life.

2018
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:58,510
They're living in an altered state
forever and their mouths are red.

2019
01:58:59,350 --> 01:59:02,470
Okay. With this stuff, it
makes us nasty red blood.

2020
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:07,360
So you're out there with a high
person that looks like a Zombie.

2021
01:59:08,770 --> 01:59:11,110
Okay. All right. And this eight people,

2022
01:59:11,111 --> 01:59:16,111
sometimes they're hot high person that
looks like as long as you see if you can

2023
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:21,220
pull up bu way. Okay.
Just be u w a y, whatever.

2024
01:59:21,221 --> 01:59:25,420
Pull it up and see if you find
him. Papa New Guinea. Okay.

2025
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:26,600
All right.

2026
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:31,600
And Cameron and a village.

2027
01:59:31,661 --> 01:59:36,640
One time. I would say every single
person that I met that was like,

2028
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:38,830
you know,
local people on the hunt.

2029
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:43,020
I think they were high on weed from the
morning that they waked up to the firm

2030
01:59:43,070 --> 01:59:44,650
from when they woke up to
when they went to sleep.

2031
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:47,450
It's just that just part of
their existence. Cameroon. Yeah.

2032
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:51,730
It's just part of their existence was
there. Heart daily life was so hard.

2033
01:59:51,731 --> 01:59:56,470
They're looking for any kind of escape
out of it. Okay. It's just brutal.

2034
01:59:56,860 --> 02:00:00,410
I mean if you and I had to live in it,
if you had to, you don't understand.

2035
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:04,930
I don't judge them. I don't have
to live there. Right. And you know,

2036
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:07,300
you and I get to go home and
sleep and comfortable beds.

2037
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,750
We get to take a shower
every night. I mean, just go,

2038
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:14,080
just go challenge the average person
to go two weeks without a shower,

2039
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:17,410
just go two weeks out of shower,
have one pair of underwear,

2040
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:21,490
see what your existence is like
and then do it in the jungle.

2041
02:00:21,620 --> 02:00:23,580
Didn't do it in the jungle,
man of Cameroon.

2042
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:28,150
Do it or wherever or on the mountains
in Afghanistan are mountains of Pakistan

2043
02:00:28,151 --> 02:00:31,540
downs, Mongolia. Gary is place that you
ever went to when you were doing all this?

2044
02:00:31,650 --> 02:00:33,400
None.
He had some scary,

2045
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:37,980
scary ass incidences of falling.
You know,

2046
02:00:37,990 --> 02:00:42,190
I've thought I was going to
die from falling twice and
I had a guy saved my life

2047
02:00:42,191 --> 02:00:45,460
and Armenia went on to on
successful sheep hunts there.

2048
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:50,860
And uh, I fell. It was horrible. I thought
I was done. How far did you fall? Well,

2049
02:00:50,861 --> 02:00:55,861
I was sliding on a sheet of
ice and I had my stick and it,

2050
02:00:57,310 --> 02:01:01,330
and I've kept my stick buried in and it
saved me and this dude risk his life and

2051
02:01:01,331 --> 02:01:02,350
came and saved my life.

2052
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:06,850
And so I was looking down at
2000 feet and then going off,

2053
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:10,840
sliding straight down 2000 feet and going
off a cliff and a few hundred feet and

2054
02:01:10,850 --> 02:01:14,320
then going down in the bottom. And then,
you know, I've always, I've had animals,

2055
02:01:14,321 --> 02:01:17,380
you know, the closest animal that
ever nearly got me was a black bear.

2056
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:21,100
Where was this? That was
in Alaska. What happened?

2057
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:26,840
Silly stuff, you know,
just real thick. And

2058
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:33,430
I was hunting with a Athabaskan
person, you know, half and half,

2059
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,140
or a person who was half Indian,

2060
02:01:35,141 --> 02:01:38,590
half white person and I'm awesome guy.

2061
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:43,190
And we were walking, we were actually
moose hunting and I had a bear tag.

2062
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:44,870
And uh,

2063
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:50,560
I look straight down and I saw this bird
print on the ground and I looked at it

2064
02:01:52,401 --> 02:01:56,900
and I said, man, that's like the freshest
trackapp ever seen him alive. I was like,

2065
02:01:57,140 --> 02:02:00,860
it must have just been here.
I'm talking to the students like closer,

2066
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:03,610
you know how you walk when you're
hunting. Right. And I hear,

2067
02:02:04,930 --> 02:02:09,500
I look up and it's climbing the
tree right here. Okay. We jumped it.

2068
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:14,440
So I threw up my shot it.
Anyway, we tracked it and um,

2069
02:02:15,190 --> 02:02:18,510
it was really, really thick. Like those
of you hunted in Alaska or even like, um,

2070
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:22,340
okay. Or South it, Bruce Columbia or
anywhere on the coast of British Columbia.

2071
02:02:22,341 --> 02:02:27,310
Yeah, I like those alders you know, it's
just nasty, thick brush. Right. And uh,

2072
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:30,980
anyway, I couldn't see anything. You
know how quite a blackberry is, right?

2073
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:35,750
So the guide sees it and he sees it. I
can't see, he's like right in front of me.

2074
02:02:35,751 --> 02:02:39,110
I'm like, shoot it, you know, if you
can see it, I can't see. Boom Dude,

2075
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:42,620
it flipped out. It just, just,

2076
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:46,130
just destroying everything around
big seven foot blackberry, you know,

2077
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:51,260
just destroying everything around it
and it rolled and I shot in there, boom,

2078
02:02:51,261 --> 02:02:56,120
boom, boom. And I shot in there and um,
you know, I thought I'd got it, you know,

2079
02:02:56,121 --> 02:02:57,450
it felt pretty good about that and this,

2080
02:02:57,460 --> 02:03:00,230
all this whole thing happened
just like in a few minutes. Okay.

2081
02:03:00,231 --> 02:03:02,180
Just wasn't very long.
Right.

2082
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:07,330
And then I walk over there to see where
the bears had him walking around. Like,

2083
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:09,980
like, you know, walking and I'm
looking, looking, looking, looking,

2084
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:13,520
and then I look in the bear
just like right here, looking
the opposite direction.

2085
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:17,120
Okay.
So a very,

2086
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:21,130
and just turned and just rule
Hodges went as I built him,

2087
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:26,090
he fell back and she fell
back and shot it. Ooh. Yeah.

2088
02:03:26,630 --> 02:03:28,670
And that was just,
but you know,

2089
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:31,760
different situations like as far as
the country goes, you know, I've had,

2090
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:36,800
I had been a lot of different scary
places with regards to, you know,

2091
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:38,600
people more than anything.
You know,

2092
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:41,810
I've hunted Ethiopia couple of times
so that people were weird. Oh my God.

2093
02:03:41,811 --> 02:03:44,000
That's the guy. He's got that
stuff in his mouth. There you go.

2094
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:47,030
That's what they looked like over there.
What's that stuff called again?

2095
02:03:47,050 --> 02:03:50,940
Bu is what they called it boot
way or something. I googled,

2096
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:55,760
it's called a tell nut. Yeah.
It's some kind of nut. Yeah. Yeah.

2097
02:03:56,810 --> 02:04:01,430
And it's got some sort of, uh,
what's, what's the effect of it?

2098
02:04:03,230 --> 02:04:07,070
But tell him, well, it's obviously a
bad teeth affect on your teeth. Yeah.

2099
02:04:07,071 --> 02:04:11,320
It seems like it. Jesus Christ. Huh?

2100
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,850
Beetle nut.
Yeah.

2101
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:17,660
And it has some sort of a
narcotic effect or I'm like,

2102
02:04:17,661 --> 02:04:22,130
I've asked him and what effect is it
like that cat stuff that they chew,

2103
02:04:22,190 --> 02:04:25,820
that's a different, let me do that.
I'm not, you know, just a bunch of,

2104
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:29,600
I don't know a lot about
drugs, so, but it's Christ,

2105
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:33,500
it's a hard life.
It's a very hard life.

2106
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:38,260
And you think that all these experiences
going to all these different places made

2107
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:41,380
you appreciate your own
existence here in civilization.

2108
02:04:41,381 --> 02:04:44,260
More a hundred percent
that makes you really like,

2109
02:04:44,740 --> 02:04:49,620
just like the way people are abused and
other places and the way they don't have

2110
02:04:49,621 --> 02:04:52,720
rights of life. The value a lot
there. If you're abused, you know,

2111
02:04:52,721 --> 02:04:56,740
and you're just taken advantage of by
whatever the government, the local,

2112
02:04:56,770 --> 02:05:00,490
every city or just the situation, your
plight in the world. I don't think that,

2113
02:05:00,491 --> 02:05:04,630
you know, people say, well there's
no value of life. And I understand,

2114
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:09,730
you know, they, I watched one
time a guy didn't want to spend

2115
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:13,780
40 bucks to keep his kid
alive and let him die.

2116
02:05:13,870 --> 02:05:15,760
He said he already spent a
hundred and that was enough.

2117
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:17,073
Oh,

2118
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:21,380
okay. You're getting into real
situations, Joe, like that.

2119
02:05:21,381 --> 02:05:26,381
You see different ways people look
at it and Christ and so now look,

2120
02:05:27,681 --> 02:05:30,560
is this every person there? No, but
that's situations that happened.

2121
02:05:31,070 --> 02:05:35,210
Those are choices they had
to make. Wow. And so yeah,

2122
02:05:35,211 --> 02:05:36,200
like absolutely.

2123
02:05:36,201 --> 02:05:39,530
It makes me appreciate America makes me
appreciate our bill of rights and makes

2124
02:05:39,531 --> 02:05:42,560
me appreciate our political system.
Makes me appreciate, you know, we,

2125
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:44,840
we pitch about things here that

2126
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:46,273
hmm,

2127
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:51,030
the other world would die to
have as a complaint. You know,

2128
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:54,600
we're upset that traffic's bad.
We're upset that, you know,

2129
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:57,880
my wife is mad at me then I'd
come home at five 30 and I said,

2130
02:05:57,881 --> 02:06:02,840
I've been with work. Right? No cannibals.

2131
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:06,010
Yeah. Barely mean were, you know,
people are upset about, you know,

2132
02:06:06,930 --> 02:06:11,860
this transgender situation.
I mean, Dude, who cares?

2133
02:06:12,490 --> 02:06:15,970
You get to go home and hug
your kid and you got a whole,

2134
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,410
the world's biggest army
dying for your rights,

2135
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:22,330
dying for you.

2136
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:28,000
You have a giant system
that's protecting your life.

2137
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:31,600
You have people dying for you every day.

2138
02:06:32,630 --> 02:06:35,090
Does one way to look at it.
Another way to look at it,

2139
02:06:35,091 --> 02:06:38,150
people would say is that giant
system is set up by the military.

2140
02:06:38,151 --> 02:06:41,570
Industrial Complex to steal
resources was another country. Okay.

2141
02:06:41,571 --> 02:06:45,950
That's why everybody's coming over
here. Right? It's the best for sure.

2142
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:48,830
This is the best possible
situation flooding in the camera.

2143
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:52,400
But it doesn't mean you and I are on a
boat to get to that better life. Well,

2144
02:06:52,401 --> 02:06:55,520
we know that it can be better. I mean
that's, I think what the argument is.

2145
02:06:55,521 --> 02:07:00,310
The argument isn't, we should
stop complaining. So we
know that we know better,

2146
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:04,430
but I'm just saying when you see it,
it's far better than New Guinea.

2147
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:05,900
It's far better than Somalia.

2148
02:07:05,901 --> 02:07:09,170
It's far better than a lot of the places
you've traveled to. Yes, absolutely.

2149
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:12,640
When you, when you do travel
to these places and you,

2150
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:15,770
you do go over there and
you experience their life,

2151
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:20,600
does it give you this feeling of uh,
like, like almost like helplessness?

2152
02:07:20,601 --> 02:07:23,600
Like you can't,
you can't do enough to help these people,

2153
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:26,760
the system that they're involved
in the life that they lived there,

2154
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:31,880
the community and there we sort of
entangled in. I can tell you, Hans,

2155
02:07:31,881 --> 02:07:32,890
I've gone on with my dad and,
and he

2156
02:07:32,890 --> 02:07:37,450
brought 20, full giant Cabella's bag,
just where the gifts for him, you know,

2157
02:07:37,451 --> 02:07:41,200
just given stuff at the very end with
my dad's named Larry would call it Larry

2158
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:44,350
Mart. We just let them all come
in and just pick everything
they wanted, you know,

2159
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:49,150
and giving them things to hunt
with. No, just soccer balls,

2160
02:07:49,151 --> 02:07:53,020
frisbees,
close toothbrushes,

2161
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:56,020
anything,
you know,

2162
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:58,930
and these are people that like need it

2163
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:03,490
and this is not something that
anybody would expect from you.

2164
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:07,680
They see this thing about you count on
the Rhino Dude, I'd be like so judged,

2165
02:08:07,681 --> 02:08:09,730
I don't eat whatever.
I don't care what people expect.

2166
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:11,440
I know what my life's
like and I know what I do.

2167
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:15,310
But you certainly must have some feeling
about otherwise you wouldn't respond to

2168
02:08:15,311 --> 02:08:18,550
them. Right. And they were
like the ones that look, yeah,

2169
02:08:18,551 --> 02:08:20,440
I mean I have a feeling about,
I try to,

2170
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:23,620
I'm just trying to like bring
some awareness that hey,

2171
02:08:23,621 --> 02:08:26,620
maybe there's more to this than what
you see. You can hate me. That's fine.

2172
02:08:26,621 --> 02:08:29,710
Whatever. I don't mean, well CNN,
you know, like, like you said,

2173
02:08:29,711 --> 02:08:33,850
they came under fire because that's kind
of exactly what they said. They, they,

2174
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:37,030
when they finally went over
there and reported they did,

2175
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:40,720
they went over there and reported a day,
did actual real journalism,

2176
02:08:40,721 --> 02:08:45,220
which is getting rarer and rarer. We
talked to, we talked about that. You know,

2177
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:47,770
the reason I felt
comfortable with those guys,

2178
02:08:47,771 --> 02:08:51,520
everybody in the world wanted to come.
Okay, look, it's there. You know,

2179
02:08:51,521 --> 02:08:55,430
they all wanted to come. The reason I
felt comfortable with Jason Morrison,

2180
02:08:55,450 --> 02:08:59,110
Ed Lavandera is I sat
down with them and I said,

2181
02:09:00,470 --> 02:09:03,520
you were going to have to come
to this with an open mind.

2182
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:07,570
You're just going to have to come and
throw away whatever you got and when you

2183
02:09:07,571 --> 02:09:11,110
come on a hunting trip, you're
complicit in it. I told him, I said,

2184
02:09:11,111 --> 02:09:14,350
you're going to be there, your look,
ed, if the rhino gets somebody,

2185
02:09:14,370 --> 02:09:15,760
knocks both the dude's down with guns,

2186
02:09:15,761 --> 02:09:18,130
you may have to grab it to save
somebody's life and kill the thing.

2187
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:21,340
You got to understand
that this isn't like,

2188
02:09:21,341 --> 02:09:23,650
I'm going to show him how to use a gun.
Absolutely.

2189
02:09:24,620 --> 02:09:27,070
I took him on a hunt beforehand.
I did all this stuff.

2190
02:09:27,071 --> 02:09:29,860
He understood I different hunt
before. Yeah. We went on, look,

2191
02:09:29,861 --> 02:09:31,270
I was taking people in there
have been hunting before.

2192
02:09:31,271 --> 02:09:32,760
I'm not going to put it
in there, dude. It's,

2193
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:36,400
it'd be freaking a joke for me to take
them out on their first real hunting

2194
02:09:36,401 --> 02:09:39,290
experience. It's an animal. It's going
to kill him. I mean he's just like,

2195
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:44,100
like I'm hunting just plains game
animals just for a day, you know.

2196
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:46,120
And um,
you know,

2197
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:50,350
I was trying to figure out who could
actually like make it and not get killed,

2198
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:53,290
you know, make it not cost
somebody's death because you know,

2199
02:09:53,291 --> 02:09:57,540
when you're looking around
he get goofy. They, they,

2200
02:09:57,650 --> 02:09:59,230
a couple of them got goofy,
you know,

2201
02:09:59,231 --> 02:10:01,300
ed ended up being the only
person there and then the,

2202
02:10:01,450 --> 02:10:06,450
the rhino charged him at a like all
like the wild is crap turn of events.

2203
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:10,780
Here's the CNN guy running at me and
come underneath the gun. What did,

2204
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:13,420
what did he describe the
experience like personally?

2205
02:10:13,450 --> 02:10:16,720
What did he take away
from it? Boy, it was a,

2206
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:21,610
it was a eye opening experience
to all those guys. Like,

2207
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:26,770
I honestly felt like
one of them really was.

2208
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:30,340
He wasn't on,
I mean he was kind of real ambivalent,

2209
02:10:30,341 --> 02:10:34,100
but he wasn't like some guy who thought
it was the best thing in the for sure.

2210
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:36,590
And it was really pretty
open minded about it.

2211
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:39,320
He just wanted to go there and report
what was going down and the true

2212
02:10:39,321 --> 02:10:43,850
journalists stuff. Okay. They were really
pretty hardcore journalistic about it.

2213
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:48,110
But I think there, when we delivered the
meat, I think he kind of got teary eyed.

2214
02:10:48,590 --> 02:10:52,440
I mean he kinda got at that
point he kinda got it. And,

2215
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:56,600
and the fact that man, this
is real, you know, he got,

2216
02:10:56,660 --> 02:11:01,430
he got a big experience out of it
because the rhino went for him. You know,

2217
02:11:01,431 --> 02:11:05,690
he was like, he got the fear of an animal
trying to kill him, you know? So he,

2218
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:08,690
he had a pretty unique experience about
it. I think he talked about it on there.

2219
02:11:08,691 --> 02:11:12,930
I don't, I can't remember.
But he didn't talk about, he
didn't talk about, you know,

2220
02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:15,360
we didn't talk about the
rhino charging him, but he,

2221
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:17,930
for somebody who wasn't
involved in hunting and they,

2222
02:11:17,931 --> 02:11:20,720
one of the smartest moves I've ever seen
anybody to where he ran, where he ran,

2223
02:11:20,721 --> 02:11:23,510
if he ran a different way, he probably
would be dead right now. What did he do?

2224
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:26,870
Well, the Rhino, we had,

2225
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:30,590
remember I told you that we jumped it
right and we sit down right and left.

2226
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:34,910
Well then we, we kept
following it. And this is,

2227
02:11:34,911 --> 02:11:38,910
this is like the 10 mile point.
We followed it, we jumped it,

2228
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:42,470
we it, we didn't know we
jumped it. We went over there,

2229
02:11:42,471 --> 02:11:44,930
we saw that we did and we
had so many people there.

2230
02:11:44,931 --> 02:11:47,630
We had to keep splitting the group up and
then they would come back up and like,

2231
02:11:47,631 --> 02:11:50,690
right. And so I told her, I said,
look man, if this thing goes wrong,

2232
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:53,330
it's going to be when we lose the track.
Okay.

2233
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:59,530
And so when we're walking along and we
lose the track and Handy Ph goes with a

2234
02:12:03,321 --> 02:12:04,820
couple of the trackers.
One way,

2235
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:09,270
I go with a couple of the trackers
the other way and then I heard and I,

2236
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:14,350
and it's behind me and the two guys in
front of me just immediately move from

2237
02:12:14,691 --> 02:12:18,410
about here to there. So I see them
moving and I heard it behind me.

2238
02:12:18,411 --> 02:12:20,030
So to make distance,

2239
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:23,510
I just took these steps to get to right
there and then turn because I knew,

2240
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:26,480
I thought, well if I just turn around
right here, it's going to hit me right.

2241
02:12:26,660 --> 02:12:30,350
Cause it was so close.
And how close man,

2242
02:12:30,351 --> 02:12:34,640
like 30 40 feet. Oh, okay.

2243
02:12:34,641 --> 02:12:39,590
It had bedded down. We jumped it. Okay.
And so, and it ran. I turned around,

2244
02:12:39,591 --> 02:12:42,590
I saw for that dude, that thing move
like lightning dude. It was like,

2245
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:45,950
I don't know if you were watching the
bull riding dude's like a real athletic

2246
02:12:45,951 --> 02:12:49,880
bull with a saber on it, you
know? Okay. And so anyway,

2247
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:55,580
it goes and we're really lucky and hint,
he came back and looked at, ed said,

2248
02:12:55,581 --> 02:12:59,750
look, and he said, if this thing,
this next time it's coming,

2249
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,500
okay, we pushed it twice
as hot. It's going to come.

2250
02:13:04,970 --> 02:13:09,170
And so anyway,
we kept going and

2251
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:12,560
I said, hey, hey Auntie,

2252
02:13:12,561 --> 02:13:15,920
I think he should go back there and
let's just split it up again, you know,

2253
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:18,140
put them a hundred yards behind us.
Okay.

2254
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:21,380
And we'll keep one camera man with me
and you and the trackers and then ed can

2255
02:13:21,381 --> 02:13:24,020
stay a little bit further behind.
And another guy who was there with us,

2256
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:27,320
he goes back there,
talks to him,

2257
02:13:27,321 --> 02:13:32,160
comes back up to me and this is after we
walked into their 20 minutes or so and

2258
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,860
I said, what's up? You
see how it's, we're good.

2259
02:13:35,050 --> 02:13:40,050
And we start walking and then
I hear just like some noise,

2260
02:13:40,171 --> 02:13:40,740
you know?

2261
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:45,060
And it was the other dude trying to get
my attention from like 30 yards back.

2262
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:49,230
Okay. And his voice was draw cause we
haven't drunk water and a couple of hours.

2263
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:53,580
Okay, we're out. And
then I hear hint say Ed,

2264
02:13:53,581 --> 02:13:58,230
get down and get down. You know, just like
run, get down Ron, Ron, Ron. And I'm like,

2265
02:13:58,231 --> 02:14:01,650
well you know, I just plant my right
foot as hard as I could. I was like,

2266
02:14:01,651 --> 02:14:04,290
I'm not moving. You know, I
had time to think about that.

2267
02:14:05,010 --> 02:14:07,230
And like in this whole thing
lasted like three seconds.

2268
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:11,760
So I had time to think about it and I
look and I see edge is flying at me,

2269
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:15,570
like running like, dude, the cowboys would
have picked him up that day. That dude,

2270
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:17,990
big dude, he was flying bro, like figures,

2271
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,790
a huge motivator and he's flying at me.

2272
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:25,830
He comes like coming from an angle like
right here where this moose goal is and

2273
02:14:25,831 --> 02:14:29,850
just ducks and just flies underneath
the rifle. I know what's coming. Right.

2274
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:34,800
I know. He knew that you were going to
pull your rifle. He went, yeah, he was.

2275
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:37,670
Well he didn't, he was yelling at him,
get down, get down, get down. You know,

2276
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:40,200
cause we're really worried about
shooting each other. Right.

2277
02:14:40,610 --> 02:14:42,930
We're all stringed out.
Really what happened was,

2278
02:14:42,931 --> 02:14:46,950
I think ed missed the memo to sit
back and he started walking forward.

2279
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:48,270
So when he started walking forward,

2280
02:14:48,271 --> 02:14:52,110
the Rhino had actually circled around on
its own track and in a way was sitting

2281
02:14:52,111 --> 02:14:56,460
there waiting for us. Okay. So
Hindi and I walked past it. Well,

2282
02:14:56,490 --> 02:14:59,340
ed starts walking out,
well the rhino gets up,

2283
02:14:59,370 --> 02:15:03,570
walks around this tree and starts
taking steps for him. Okay.

2284
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:08,550
Like looking like this kind of inquisitive
and then just came dude like just was

2285
02:15:08,551 --> 02:15:12,030
like, like a Bat Outta hell. You shot
that thing when it was on a chart,

2286
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:14,940
it was charging Ed.
He runs under he dude,

2287
02:15:14,941 --> 02:15:18,390
he like moves so quick and I like,

2288
02:15:18,391 --> 02:15:21,960
we talked about it cause I was like, I
was like talk to the producer. I was like,

2289
02:15:21,961 --> 02:15:25,320
dude, it's really pig pro. You know?
I was like, he's like, don't worry,

2290
02:15:25,321 --> 02:15:30,210
he's light on his feet.
You should have seen him at
Ferguson was like, right. Okay,

2291
02:15:30,420 --> 02:15:33,840
this guy's going to the craziest
fucking spots on there. Yeah. So anyway,

2292
02:15:33,841 --> 02:15:38,490
somebody had CNNS mad at Ed.
Yeah. So anyways, like he
comes flying underneath me,

2293
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:42,390
the animals charging him and when it,
you know, they don't have good eyesight.

2294
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:47,160
Okay. So when he came low, I think that
it was so thick that the rhino lost him,

2295
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:48,410
like,
you know,

2296
02:15:48,450 --> 02:15:51,900
lost where he went and it kind of
just veered a little bit to the left.

2297
02:15:51,930 --> 02:15:54,820
And when he comes underneath me,
I just see it coming and turn in,

2298
02:15:55,110 --> 02:15:57,840
like just turning,
veering,

2299
02:15:57,841 --> 02:16:01,620
and it's like less than 18 yards.
It was right there,

2300
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:05,230
45 feet and not boom, boom. Whoa. Yeah.

2301
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:10,260
When you got up to the rhinos body,
what is,

2302
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:13,320
what does that feel in like?
It was like a,

2303
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:16,740
in this case it was different than
any hot I'd ever been on, you know,

2304
02:16:16,741 --> 02:16:18,870
because so much went into the magnitude.

2305
02:16:19,250 --> 02:16:21,390
I'd be like the magnitude
of the experience,

2306
02:16:21,391 --> 02:16:23,370
the magnitude of the whole situation,

2307
02:16:23,430 --> 02:16:27,330
magnitude being that like this
is like the most, you know,

2308
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:33,520
hunt under a microscope that may be
ever existed without a doubt. Okay.

2309
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:35,890
And so I was just like this stress,

2310
02:16:35,891 --> 02:16:39,190
it was going into it because we could have
shot the wrong one. Right, right. Okay.

2311
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:41,800
What happens if the wrong one charges,
right?

2312
02:16:41,890 --> 02:16:44,080
You got to kill it and then
we killed the wrong one.

2313
02:16:44,081 --> 02:16:46,780
That's the worst thing that could happen.
We're outside of somebody dying.

2314
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:50,670
What does happen when that happens? If
you killed, we don't bring it home. Yeah.

2315
02:16:50,671 --> 02:16:54,790
You don't bring it home, you leave
it. It's just that you're done.

2316
02:16:55,510 --> 02:16:59,620
So the $350,000 is gone and
this problem mail is still out.

2317
02:16:59,621 --> 02:17:03,550
That actually is the absolute worst
situation. Wow. And so anyway,

2318
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:08,220
so what to walk up, have the
guy, you know, look at it. He,

2319
02:17:08,270 --> 02:17:12,040
we saw it from a game camera
that was on a waterhole.

2320
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:15,070
We saw a picture of it and the guy said,
that's it.

2321
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:19,330
This is the one that killed the
one last year. This is it. Okay.

2322
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:24,390
And so he knew it by, there was ear
notch from where it had, you know,

2323
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:26,260
when they originally dropped
that animal off there,

2324
02:17:26,261 --> 02:17:30,040
they so they could recognize it.
And so, and there's other animals,

2325
02:17:30,041 --> 02:17:34,150
you know the rhinos, there's rhinos
there. I mean it's wild area, you know,

2326
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:37,780
and so the reason they're there
is that water is there. Okay.

2327
02:17:38,620 --> 02:17:41,800
So anyway, we, yeah, just
walking up to it was just like,

2328
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:45,370
it wasn't like it's over cause
it really kind of wasn't.

2329
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:48,580
I knew that all those
storm was going to happen.

2330
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:51,970
You just didn't know to the extent.
Well, this time I knew, you know,

2331
02:17:52,030 --> 02:17:53,690
this time I knew it was coming mean.

2332
02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:58,390
It really was the most scrutinized
hunt the human race has ever known.

2333
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:02,380
Absolutely. I can't think of a close
second there. What's a close second?

2334
02:18:02,410 --> 02:18:04,750
I really don't have one in mind.
I never,

2335
02:18:04,751 --> 02:18:08,530
I've never seen anything that got
this kind of scrutiny. I did. I look,

2336
02:18:08,531 --> 02:18:11,350
I've been involved in hunting my whole
life that I'd never seen anything like it.

2337
02:18:11,830 --> 02:18:15,520
And so like it was just like I felt an
extreme amount of pressure on me to make

2338
02:18:15,521 --> 02:18:19,480
sure everything was done correctly and
that's why I felt comfortable bringing

2339
02:18:19,481 --> 02:18:22,180
them. I felt like they were just going
to do an honest portrayal of what was up.

2340
02:18:22,870 --> 02:18:26,330
Have you stayed in contact with Ed since
that? Yeah, I'll talk to him. You know,

2341
02:18:26,390 --> 02:18:28,600
he was down at the flood in Houston
the other day. I just said, hey,

2342
02:18:28,601 --> 02:18:30,170
you know what's up and you know,

2343
02:18:30,190 --> 02:18:34,330
letting them know kind of what else had
happened since then with where the rhino

2344
02:18:34,331 --> 02:18:37,870
was at and stuff like that. Because he
generally had an interest in it. Like he,

2345
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:42,340
he gave a damn, you know,
what is his take the backlash.

2346
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:48,270
He got to experience some backlash
himself during a deal with the,

2347
02:18:48,271 --> 02:18:53,271
in Ferguson where the drudge report
reported that he showed where this guy's

2348
02:18:53,891 --> 02:18:55,750
place was at.
So he dealt with a bunch,

2349
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:58,380
which I don't know if that was true
or not. I really didn't get into it.

2350
02:18:58,390 --> 02:19:02,800
I don't think it was, but,
um, I don't know. And anyway,

2351
02:19:02,890 --> 02:19:06,430
he had dealt with a lot of scrutiny
before, so he kind of understood it,

2352
02:19:06,431 --> 02:19:10,840
but he kind of felt a lot like you did.
Like anybody would,

2353
02:19:10,841 --> 02:19:14,650
they're threatening your kids. Come on.
You know what I mean? This is all crap,

2354
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:19,180
you know? And I think almost every
person you would, even piers Morgan,

2355
02:19:19,230 --> 02:19:22,930
you know who appears, when did you
see my interview with him? No. Okay.

2356
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:26,290
The first time I did an interview with
peers when we cut this big shark over

2357
02:19:26,291 --> 02:19:30,980
here in Huntington beach. Right. Okay. He
was all over that. That dude love that.

2358
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:32,660
He thought that was awesome.

2359
02:19:32,661 --> 02:19:35,600
Long live your fish and this is
the coolest thing ever. Okay.

2360
02:19:36,050 --> 02:19:39,470
Like we were kind of surprised
right when we did that.

2361
02:19:39,890 --> 02:19:44,600
So then the rhino thing comes up and
one of the producers for that show who

2362
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:50,470
calls me and I said, sure, I'll talk
to him. And so we are, no, no, no.

2363
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:54,560
Ed called me and he said,

2364
02:19:54,561 --> 02:19:56,810
do you want to talk about it and
you're welcome. Thomas says, sure,

2365
02:19:56,811 --> 02:19:59,890
I'll talk to peers is how that
happened. Not Remember. And so I uh,

2366
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:01,280
they got me on there,
dude.

2367
02:20:01,281 --> 02:20:06,170
And he came like guns a blazing
and at the end of it, he's like,

2368
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:08,840
you may have a point with the
conservation aspects of this,

2369
02:20:09,050 --> 02:20:12,110
but what I don't get as
you're hunting photos. Okay.

2370
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:17,320
So the rage about me standing there
next to an animal bothered him.

2371
02:20:17,990 --> 02:20:22,190
Like it bothers thousands of
people. Okay. And, and so, yeah,

2372
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:27,140
he said it in a nutshell.
He said, you're right,

2373
02:20:27,470 --> 02:20:31,920
but don't take pictures. Yeah,
you're, you're, you know, you,

2374
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:35,090
you may have a point,
but this is what pisses me off.

2375
02:20:35,530 --> 02:20:37,780
Well, that's stupid. That's
is just a photograph.

2376
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:41,530
Why should you not capture that
moment if you're going to do it?

2377
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:45,310
If there's no problem with doing it,
the actual act isn't a problem.

2378
02:20:45,311 --> 02:20:50,230
But the photograph of the act, that
enraged. So maybe pain. That's insane.

2379
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:53,800
Well, he's no longer on the network.
Well, he's a douchebag. Well,

2380
02:20:54,190 --> 02:20:55,540
I wouldn't say that about a lot of people,

2381
02:20:55,541 --> 02:20:59,650
but that guy was involved in some really
shady shit in England with the tabloids

2382
02:20:59,651 --> 02:21:03,910
were the tabloids had tacked
into a victim's cell phones.

2383
02:21:04,030 --> 02:21:06,360
Do you know that whole story behind it?
That big,

2384
02:21:06,430 --> 02:21:09,490
a family of a woman who turned
up missing? They, uh, they,

2385
02:21:09,610 --> 02:21:14,080
they got hope because they found that
she had checked her voicemail on her cell

2386
02:21:14,081 --> 02:21:16,210
phone. Well, it turns out she didn't,

2387
02:21:16,390 --> 02:21:21,160
the company that he worked for had hacked
into her phone and they were checking

2388
02:21:21,161 --> 02:21:25,180
her voice. Oh, nice. It's
tabloid Shit, man. You know,

2389
02:21:25,181 --> 02:21:30,100
and that's a lot of what he
did was tabloid sensationalism
shit where even if he

2390
02:21:30,101 --> 02:21:31,750
had an opinion on something,
you know,

2391
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:35,740
there's a lot of what they do that what
we were talking about before, they're,

2392
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:39,370
they're trying to get social
brownie points. They're trying to

2393
02:21:40,890 --> 02:21:44,380
look, dude, okay, if somebody comes in
here and you don't have a gun and I do,

2394
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:48,670
you want me to just let them kill you? Not
only that, the waste typically, I mean,

2395
02:21:48,730 --> 02:21:52,810
look, Ted Nugent is a funny character
to have on when you're discussing that,

2396
02:21:52,811 --> 02:21:53,800
but at the end of the day,

2397
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:56,470
he's very fucking informed
when it comes to that stuff.

2398
02:21:56,500 --> 02:22:00,100
Very informed and pierce wasn't
prepared for that and he looked stupid.

2399
02:22:00,610 --> 02:22:01,381
He really did.
He did.

2400
02:22:01,381 --> 02:22:05,320
He understand like a lot of those shooting
deaths are cops shooting people in

2401
02:22:05,321 --> 02:22:09,430
the act of crimes like murder and
domestic violence and robbery.

2402
02:22:09,431 --> 02:22:10,870
And every time I talk,
talk

2403
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:13,830
to it, like a big, or I talked to our
hand and talked to Erin Burnett on there,

2404
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:16,600
talk to they,
they may have come at me a little bit.

2405
02:22:16,601 --> 02:22:17,770
They didn't have the facts right.

2406
02:22:17,980 --> 02:22:20,620
And the problem is if you don't
have the facts on your side,

2407
02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:22,120
and especially in this situation,

2408
02:22:22,121 --> 02:22:24,040
if you don't have the facts on
your side and you're left with,

2409
02:22:24,340 --> 02:22:26,100
I'm going to cut this guy out and
threaten his kid, you've already

2410
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:30,420
lost. He was lost and in the, and so
they're just left without raging. Okay.

2411
02:22:30,450 --> 02:22:34,830
But that ain't helping anything, I hope,
agree with you or disagree with you.

2412
02:22:34,831 --> 02:22:36,480
If people are listening to this,
did they,

2413
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:41,660
they get at the end of the day that
this is a very complex situation that is

2414
02:22:43,231 --> 02:22:48,210
not, it's not black and white. There's no
good guys and bad guys. And when you're,

2415
02:22:48,211 --> 02:22:50,670
when you're looking at
something like hunting, you're,

2416
02:22:50,671 --> 02:22:55,290
you're looking at something that has
existed literally since the beginning of

2417
02:22:55,291 --> 02:22:58,050
human beings. It's, it's
been a part of what,

2418
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:01,470
what created civilization
in the first place.

2419
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:06,830
What led to us surviving and that's been
somehow or another co opted by factory

2420
02:23:10,201 --> 02:23:15,201
farming and fast food and restaurant
chains and that has become our reality and

2421
02:23:17,430 --> 02:23:21,660
we are, our existence is entirely
unnatural and disconnected because of it.

2422
02:23:21,661 --> 02:23:25,110
Our relationship with the very
food we eat is delusional.

2423
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:30,620
And what you're doing by by
being a part of conservation,

2424
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:36,930
whether or not you know it makes sense
to people or whether or not they agree

2425
02:23:36,931 --> 02:23:39,870
with it or disagree with it. Once they
look at the actual facts behind it,

2426
02:23:39,871 --> 02:23:44,280
they'll see that this is not, you're
not doing an evil thing. You're not,

2427
02:23:44,330 --> 02:23:46,170
not only not doing an evil thing,
you're,

2428
02:23:46,171 --> 02:23:50,010
you're not doing a thing that even
can be logically criticized from the

2429
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:51,690
standpoint of conservation.

2430
02:23:51,990 --> 02:23:55,260
You might feel uncomfortable
that someone's going to
go over there and shoot a

2431
02:23:55,261 --> 02:23:59,670
rhino. You might feel uncomfortable about
it, but that's your right. When you,

2432
02:23:59,671 --> 02:24:02,040
when you start looking at
the facts behind it, though,

2433
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:05,780
it's very difficult to argue against the,

2434
02:24:05,950 --> 02:24:09,510
the idea of hunting as conservation,
whether you want to do it or not.

2435
02:24:09,511 --> 02:24:11,490
Like I said, I don't want to do
it. I don't, I don't want to go to,

2436
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:14,970
I don't want a hundred rhino. I don't
want to on a brown bear. I don't want to,

2437
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:16,500
but I understand it.

2438
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:20,550
I understand it completely and totally
from the point of view of conservation.

2439
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:23,700
Well,
I'm glad that you do.

2440
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:27,240
I think it's cool that you do and I think
that it's cool that you're open minded

2441
02:24:27,241 --> 02:24:30,060
enough to get something that hey, maybe
you don't want to do. Because I think,

2442
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:32,820
I think that's kind of the issue is like,
look,

2443
02:24:32,821 --> 02:24:36,120
I don't want to do a lot of things,
but I don't judge people who do.

2444
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:40,440
And I definitely don't judge people who
actually have a stake in the game when

2445
02:24:40,441 --> 02:24:44,670
it comes to keeping something around or
keeping something good around, you know,

2446
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:49,350
you uncomfortable reality of
attaching monetary value to life,

2447
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:51,420
whether it's the plane's games,

2448
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:54,990
animals that were on the
verge of extinction just a
few decades ago in Africa

2449
02:24:54,991 --> 02:24:58,030
that are thriving now because they're
valuable or whether it's because of white

2450
02:24:58,031 --> 02:24:58,864
tail deer,

2451
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:02,190
which there's more whitetail
deer in American now than
there were when Columbus,

2452
02:25:02,191 --> 02:25:02,401
I mean,

2453
02:25:02,401 --> 02:25:06,210
we could talk for another three hours
about like conservation success stories.

2454
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:11,370
How about elk elk than the veteran?
Just like Florida Panther. Even there.

2455
02:25:11,371 --> 02:25:15,420
Okay. Hunters brought that back.
Hunters brought the wolf back.

2456
02:25:15,421 --> 02:25:18,060
Trappers brought the wolf
back to North America. Okay.

2457
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:23,980
And especially in like the southwest
or I got him Roy McBride, Google

2458
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,820
it.
But so you can,

2459
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:30,980
it's the people who live it have a
vested stake in keeping it around.

2460
02:25:32,530 --> 02:25:36,230
And if hunter, if you
have a problem with, um,

2461
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:40,030
hunters keeping these animals around,

2462
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:42,310
then don't go take pictures of a rock,
rock,

2463
02:25:42,430 --> 02:25:45,130
white rhino don't cause the,

2464
02:25:45,140 --> 02:25:48,220
the reason that why rhino there
cause a hunter's bro period.

2465
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:52,930
The reason these whitetail deer in
big numbers because of hunters. Okay.

2466
02:25:52,931 --> 02:25:57,400
So if you're taking a picture of
it, you may not get it, you know,

2467
02:25:58,060 --> 02:26:02,080
and it's insulting to those who have done
all the work to keep it around so you

2468
02:26:02,081 --> 02:26:07,081
can have a opinion about
it that's justified or not.

2469
02:26:07,301 --> 02:26:10,990
Right. It's not, it's not, it's
just your opinion of it. Okay.

2470
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:13,720
And it's there for you to talk about.

2471
02:26:13,721 --> 02:26:16,720
It's there for you and joy at
a price you didn't have to pay.

2472
02:26:17,410 --> 02:26:21,760
Is it convenient opinion? It's a
very convenient opinion. And so,

2473
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:25,930
I mean it's,
I honestly think that,

2474
02:26:28,150 --> 02:26:31,480
I don't know
the average person,

2475
02:26:32,110 --> 02:26:35,740
especially when it comes to a lot of
these wild animals really needs to look

2476
02:26:35,741 --> 02:26:36,551
within their self and think,

2477
02:26:36,551 --> 02:26:39,010
is there a motion going to help
it and do I really need to do,

2478
02:26:39,011 --> 02:26:42,460
I hate this guy enough that he gets
cancer and dies just because he does

2479
02:26:42,461 --> 02:26:45,460
something I don't agree upon and then
go over to Namibia and take a break.

2480
02:26:45,590 --> 02:26:47,260
Go take a picture of black rhinos.

2481
02:26:47,261 --> 02:26:51,940
That dis situation helped stay alive,
period.

2482
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:55,510
Okay. I get so sick of
the people saying, well,

2483
02:26:55,511 --> 02:26:58,720
just because you get money in Africa,
it's going to curb not every situation.

2484
02:26:58,721 --> 02:27:01,870
Give me a break. Give
me a break. You know,

2485
02:27:01,871 --> 02:27:06,871
my dream is for these children that live
there to have a heritage that we have

2486
02:27:07,001 --> 02:27:10,600
with deer that we have with bear.
They can go out to a wild place,

2487
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:14,080
lay down at night,
hear a lion roar a hundred years from now.

2488
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:18,010
I give a damn about that.
Sincerely.

2489
02:27:19,210 --> 02:27:22,240
I believe you. Thanks for coming
on, man. I really appreciate it. Uh,

2490
02:27:22,420 --> 02:27:26,980
it was a nice long conversation. I think
we, uh, we chewed it up. We'd shoot it up.

2491
02:27:26,981 --> 02:27:29,680
Good. All right. I appreciate you
bro. Right. Thank you brother Coy.

2492
02:27:29,681 --> 02:27:32,050

2493
