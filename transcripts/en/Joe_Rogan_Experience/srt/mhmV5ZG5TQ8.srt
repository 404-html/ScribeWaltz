1
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,100
You know,
I grew up in an autistic family where

2
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,740
everyone was doing something in one
field of the arts or another.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,440
I was,
I think 12 years old when I did my

4
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:17,274
first,
uh,

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,100
acting at the actor's studio.
And it's,

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,580
you know,
James De once said that,

7
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,550
uh,
the only reason to become an actor is

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,600
because you have to,
um,

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,950
I think that,
you know,

10
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:32,580
from a young age,
if that is a certain rush that you're

11
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,070
going to need to,
to satisfy them to make you feel

12
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,750
fulfilled,
um,

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,670
and if you don't,
then you shouldn't do it.

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,680
There's just,
it's just too brutal of a business most

15
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,200
of the time.
Um,

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,940
so I think that at the ripe old age of
12,

17
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:46,290
I figured out,
you know,

18
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,880
I kinda like,
I kinda like this thing.

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,020
I like talking to these people.

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,050
Oh man,
it's apples and oranges.

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,780
Um,
you can't really beat movies.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,130
It's a,
it's a fun Gig I made.

23
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,320
It's nice to,
it's nice to have a trailer and makeup

24
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:01,980
and,
you know,

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,920
an entire army that's basically all
there for the same purpose,

26
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,480
which is make the best film.
We can,

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,950
um,
yeah,

28
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:11,610
when you're on an Oliver Stone said
everybody brings their a game.

29
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,610
Everybody brings their a game,
a from the top to the bottom.

30
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,260
And in between,
uh,

31
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,580
in terms of theater,
you know,

32
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:21,450
there's no,
there's no way to really duplicate that

33
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,340
rush you get when you take an audience
that is lot and right there in front of

34
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:30,690
you through the journey of a great play
and you go through these emotions so

35
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,210
that they can experience them without
having to go through them themselves.

36
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,440
It's a certain kind of human compact
that obviously you lose as soon as

37
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,880
there's a screen and the camera there.

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,050
So I think,
yeah,

39
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,870
I think we'll always have theater.
I think theater will always be a

40
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:44,550
powerful force,
uh,

41
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:47,670
because we need that human touch,
particularly as we spend more and more

42
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,290
time with machines,
cell phones,

43
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,140
computers,
we start to lose our humanity.

44
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,120
I mean the,
the,

45
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:55,200
the,
the price of our technology may very

46
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:59,250
well end up being or humanity.
So I think you gotta have that balance.

47
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,160
Um,
personally I try to do one for one.

48
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:04,670
If I can do a movie into a play,
do a movie to apply,

49
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,290
um,
while at the same time writing and being

50
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,100
in that cycle.
Uh,

51
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,320
those two fields are very writing and
acting are almost diametrically opposed

52
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:16,740
in terms of being an actor.
It's in your interest to be in shape and

53
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:20,730
to be healthy and to have a strong voice
and to be flexible as a writer,

54
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:22,980
you're sitting in this position for
hours on end,

55
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,170
you'd get up and you can put your
shoulder down.

56
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:26,850
It's a,
it's not a healthy existence,

57
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:29,250
so to speak,
and it's probably not healthy for the

58
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:30,660
person that lives with you either.
But,

59
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:32,730
um,
I need to do the best you can.

60
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,001
Hmm.
I,

61
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,320
you know,
I'm probably most proud of,

62
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,940
uh,
the plays that I've written just because

63
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:41,140
as,
as the playwright,

64
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:41,801
uh,
you know,

65
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,540
your God,
you get to do everything.

66
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,820
You don't make any money hardly at all,
but you,

67
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:48,040
uh,
you really get to kind of control the

68
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,190
scene as a screenwriter.
You're the towel boy in the whorehouse.

69
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,821
I mean,
you,

70
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,980
you know,
you're lucky if you're invited to said

71
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,930
it's okay.
It's kind of like the,

72
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:55,900
here's the blueprint,
go.

73
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,400
Um,
and that's,

74
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,990
you know,
there's been some debate as to,

75
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,070
or not a film should be by the director,
by the screenwriter or by both

76
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,330
screenwriter lost out on that is when,
um,

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,810
and,
and theater,

78
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:09,310
it's absolutely the opposite.
But,

79
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,473
you know,
I'm,

80
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,980
I'm proud of all the,
uh,

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,230
well most of the,
uh,

82
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,980
theater acting that I've done,
the thing is to try to talk about a

83
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,770
performance that will never be seen
again.

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,190
That was only lived by the people there.
It's kind of like telling somebody about

85
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,360
your dream,
you know,

86
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:25,931
they'll,
they'll,

87
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:26,890
if they love you,
they'll,

88
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,170
they'll listen and smile,
but they can't really get it.

89
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,770
Um,
so there is a certain infinite quality

90
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,580
to,
uh,

91
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,440
to film that is nice.
You do the work and,

92
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,460
you know,
it's always going to be there.

93
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,981
I,
you know,

94
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:43,080
I just,
I loved telling stories and as long as I

95
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:46,560
can make my living doing that and in all
the different mediums that I,

96
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,420
uh,
I have been lucky enough to,

97
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,400
that's enough for me.
Um,

98
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,050
really it's a,
you know,

99
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:55,080
there's different scales of stories.
Sometimes you would want to tell one

100
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:57,150
that 20,
30,

101
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:59,730
40,
50 million people will want to see and

102
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:01,020
hear.
Sometimes you do one that,

103
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,150
you know,
150 we'll want to see on one night.

104
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,000
Uh,
as long as you're telling the right

105
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,970
story for the right audience and
they're,

106
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,000
they're getting something out of it,
it's essentially the same feeling to me.

107
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,790
Um,
obviously there's the economic necessity

108
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,410
of paying your bills.
And how do you do that?

109
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,500
10 years ago when I started out,
um,

110
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,100
I was kind taught,
I was insane for trying to pursue

111
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:27,450
multiple fields at once because in five
years everyone who just did one would

112
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:28,500
have five times the resume.

113
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,660
I would if I was lucky.
Um,

114
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,870
but I took that gamble because I just,
my gut told me it was the right thing to

115
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:35,400
do.
And you know,

116
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,900
as an actor,
there's so much downtime.

117
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,790
You want to fill it with something else
and,

118
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,870
uh,
there's a writer,

119
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,250
you know,
sometimes you're doing a passion

120
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,690
project,
sometimes it's a paid Gig,

121
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:45,600
sometimes there's nothing.
So he can do a journalistic piece.

122
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,890
Um,
at this point,

123
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:49,520
I think the shift started about 2008.
Um,

124
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,230
a lot of factors while I'm sure,
but whatever the reasons,

125
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,370
2008,
it felt as though the,

126
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:00,390
the combination of distribution models
starting to tighten and the publishing

127
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:03,790
and film and music industry is having a
revolution,

128
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,780
has themselves to,
to catch up and understand how this is

129
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:10,710
going to work in the new millennium has
made it a lot easier to pursue

130
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,150
multi-platform careers.
Um,

131
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,890
it's much easier to hire one person who
can do three or four different things

132
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:20,370
than one specialist in that field,
which is,

133
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:23,700
I think about the college graduating
classes in high school classes that are

134
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:26,250
coming up now.
They're in a unique position.

135
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,900
I mean they're,
they're entering one of the toughest

136
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,700
economies of,
of all time.

137
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,530
Uh,
at the same time,

138
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,380
if they're willing to work really hard,
the ability they have to learn something

139
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,430
and much faster than we ever did before
is there.

140
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,460
And it's really a question of are you
willing to put in the effort and go that

141
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:43,860
extra marks if you are,
I think there's actually more

142
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:44,790
opportunities out there.
