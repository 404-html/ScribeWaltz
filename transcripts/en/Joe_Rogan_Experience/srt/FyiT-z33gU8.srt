1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,510
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,860
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,000
one for sure.
Live.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:09,970
No magical.
How are you?

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,120
You're a fucking responsible guest.
I just want to give you props for that.

6
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:15,490
You took your phone,
you shut that bitch off and you put it

7
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:17,560
aside.
That was a big thing for me also,

8
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:22,210
just as a comedian and comedy clubs.
You started seeing the comedy store

9
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:25,510
become popular and I started noticing a
bunch of chicks in there just looking at

10
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:29,470
their phones nonstop.
I even put this thing on my phone.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,730
It's an app called moment that tracks
how long I'm using it and what I'm

12
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:35,710
using,
so if I get over a certain amount,

13
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,420
I'm like,
I get fucking put this thing down.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,160
Does very smart.
We're all monkeys can look down at this

15
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:43,270
thing.
It's fascinating.

16
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:46,080
The dope of means of.
Yeah.

17
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:49,330
I have a 15 year old son and nonstop.
Yeah.

18
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:51,480
Whitney.
Cummings was explaining all the,

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,580
like the actual chemical responses that
go on.

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,170
Like you literally do become addicted to
that for sure.

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,770
And there's a lot of good shit on their
problem,

22
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,740
but I mean,
how many times do you find yourself like

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,010
about to go to bed and just like hitting
refresh,

24
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,680
checking twitter feeds.
Maybe some interesting news stories

25
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:10,090
coming up.
Maybe there's something I missed.

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,370
Let me check instagram.
It was a crazy picture that I didn't

27
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,690
say.
It's okay to miss it.

28
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,240
It is okay.
It's totally okay to miss it.

29
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,830
I go,
I admire what he did.

30
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,000
He stepped away from the whole fucking
smartphone.

31
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,690
Completely.
Just had a full conversation with him

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,890
about it yesterday because I said you
had three things happened that allowed

33
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:30,460
you to completely check out and go on
this trip years ago.

34
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,950
You have no kids,
you know kids.

35
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:34,430
You have no wife,
no family.

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,710
Which dog?
Dog planathon.

37
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,160
You wouldn't.
He moved to New York.

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,000
I sold him a soda.
Trey gave him all of my furniture

39
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,130
because he was moving to New York when I
was leaving New York.

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,570
So I'm like,
dude,

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,460
have all this shit.
Oh that's right.

42
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:50,590
You were there for the daily show,
for the daily show.

43
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:53,830
And then I took off.
I was commuting back and forth because I

44
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:57,550
left my family in La and I took the Gig,
so on Monday,

45
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:57,971
Tuesday,
Wednesday,

46
00:01:57,971 --> 00:01:59,880
Thursday,
I'd work in New York and then I'd

47
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,680
fucking fly back to Jesus' horrible
mistake.

48
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,850
Trust me.
We talked about that before you did it

49
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:05,681
and I was like,
man,

50
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:07,930
I don't believe you're doing this.
I was killed myself.

51
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:10,980
My back is all fucked up.
I was telling a calendar,

52
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,770
like I said,
like I was a cashew shaped and jumping

53
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:15,940
forward.
Oh my God.

54
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:18,040
It's horrible.
Like if I cracked my,

55
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,140
my whole back when you were in an
airline seat constantly and you're just

56
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:26,320
constantly all stressed out and your
sleep is all fucked up.

57
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,500
It's not good.
So I got cast in another show.

58
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,990
I got the fuck out of there and I gave
already all my things.

59
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:33,070
So.
But already has,

60
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,350
like you said,
no fish,

61
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,550
nothing.
And then he is financial freedom because

62
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:40,690
he's got a,
you know,

63
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:43,150
the show on comedy central,
he's got a great podcast,

64
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:48,151
he's got all kinds of shit going on.
And then he also has this attitude that

65
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:53,290
allows him to do something like that
because I don't have those three things

66
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,460
I needed to.
Financial Freedom.

67
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:56,650
I got.
But I have these three dependents.

68
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,700
I have two dogs and have,
I don't have the attitude,

69
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:04,450
like if I'm not working nonstop,
I feel crazy.

70
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,970
You should tell people what you're
talking about because a lot of people

71
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,730
that are tuning into this podcast
probably don't realize that our Ari,

72
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,930
our good friend,
checked out of civilization for three

73
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,520
solid months at least.

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720
Right?
I think maybe more.

75
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,430
First of all,
he's rocking a flip phone.

76
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,750
He won't,
he doesn't have any APPS,

77
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,090
so he doesn't.
Um,

78
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,620
he,
he has no smartphone,

79
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,690
but then he just decides to go away and
check out.

80
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,260
He'd no one's communicated with them.
You know,

81
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,900
we're sort of in business together on is
all things comedy thing.

82
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,970
And he's on our board of directors and I
need to tell him about shit.

83
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,320
And didn't even bother,
like he,

84
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,210
we did a skype and he's like,
I'm gone.

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,170
And then people on his show,
the comedy central show,

86
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,950
um,
they're trying to get ahold of them.

87
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:52,000
Nobody can get fucking ahold of art and
he loves it.

88
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
And me,
if I seriously,

89
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,520
I had to buy books.
Like,

90
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,250
you know,
I read a lot of Jack reacher.

91
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,700
Yeah.
Do you know that the best character of

92
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,370
all time?

93
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,740
Yeah.
Six foot four,

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,890
240 pounds.
I know Tom people associated with the

95
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,680
Tom Cruise movie,
but like this guy is the most bad ass.

96
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,210
He's a military cop.
Yeah.

97
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,060
How is the Tom Cruise?
A little tiny dude.

98
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:17,410
He just option the movies.
That's what happened.

99
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:20,920
My uncle skip Tarantino came over to me.
I didn't even know anything about Jack

100
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:23,710
reacher and my brother's wedding.
And he walks up and he goes,

101
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,820
can you believe they made Tom Cruise?
Jack reacher and I go,

102
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:29,080
what are you talking about?
There's a problem.

103
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:30,760
And he broke the whole thing down.
He goes,

104
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,800
let me tell you something about Jack
reacher Jack,

105
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:36,490
which is six foot four.
Jack reacher total bad ass.

106
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:39,430
He's he,
he's an expert marksman.

107
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,030
He's a 10 steps ahead.
He's a big numbers guy.

108
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,220
This guy,
Lee child created the perfect character,

109
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:47,050
but.
So I read all those books,

110
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:51,400
but I have to force myself to read those
books so I can chill the fuck out

111
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,580
because again,
and this is something that I'm a people

112
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:01,480
of other comics who pointed out I can't
be alone with my own thoughts.

113
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,220
Why is that?
I don't know because I've had some crazy

114
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:10,090
shit happen lately.
A dad passed away,

115
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,130
a lot of comics have passed away,
have friends with a ton of comedians

116
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:18,780
that have.
Freddy Soto was one of my good,

117
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,200
good buddies.
He's gone to.

118
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:24,580
But Dude,
I started comedy with passed away early

119
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:26,270
on.
So I,

120
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,390
you and Freddy Soto past me,
you know,

121
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,500
got me sponsored at the comedy store and
um,

122
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,730
I was very close to him like me and
Sebastian,

123
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,850
whereas openers.
And so I think that might have something

124
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:39,520
to do with it.
It's like I'm trying to get a lot of

125
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,820
great stuff happening,
but I feel like I distract myself with

126
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:47,180
work,
so I just keep busy as fuck a dude.

127
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,670
Enjoy work.
I love it.

128
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,480
I love the satisfaction of um,
I don't know,

129
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:56,350
like making stuff and having people
enjoy it.

130
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,800
So you feel like,
I mean,

131
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,650
it seems like you love doing standup
when I see her at the store and you're

132
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,060
going up.
Looks like you're having a great time,

133
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,100
a great time hanging out with other
comics.

134
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,650
I love the comedy store.
I love what the comedy store is.

135
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,070
I love what it always has been.
I love how it's had this resurgence.

136
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:12,480
I love the fact that they don't let
everybody in there.

137
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,860
Isn't that great?
It is great.

138
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,810
There's a lot of people that are trying
to get in there and they're like,

139
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,950
eh,
we're good.

140
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,220
Yeah.
And there's a lot of comics that you

141
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,400
think are great.
Come.

142
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:25,580
Mitzi had a weird thing like she didn't
pass Louis,

143
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,473
like,
that's,

144
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,090
that's crazy.
And then there was gatekeeper Tommy

145
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:33,020
there for a while who wouldn't pass,
like was holding the torch for Mitzi and

146
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,100
what her,
you know,

147
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,460
we needed a weird thing with black eyes,
like

148
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,680
the best dude.
But then I'll just add a megan come in.

149
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,970
I've been so polite.

150
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,520
But then I love the fact that like me
and you get to hang out at that back bar

151
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,380
like that.
They made that for us was really fucking

152
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,690
smart within the last two years they
made this.

153
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,190
If you guys don't know what we're
talking about,

154
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:00,950
the.
They made this video room that was just

155
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:03,950
a room in the back behind the kitchen.
And he said,

156
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:08,030
the comics love hanging out here.
Let's create a special little backbar

157
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,770
just for the comedians and their
friends.

158
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,220
And uh,
we get to have conversations in there.

159
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,520
And you had some weird thing somebody
told me the other night when I was in

160
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,860
there like,
fucking some chick was in here taking

161
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,330
pictures.
She was filming.

162
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,830
Oh yeah,
you shouldn't be filming to Santinello.

163
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,830
And I having a conversation.
And Brian Red Band Carter filming.

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,620
You can't do that.
To do that,

165
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,690
but if it's a private bar,
yeah,

166
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,200
like you're not even supposed to be back
there unless you're a comic or a friend

167
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:36,710
of a calmer.

168
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,090
Exactly.
So,

169
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,620
and that's great for us because,
you know,

170
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:40,610
none we light,
I,

171
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,290
I enjoy talking to people as much but
sometimes just gets overwhelming.

172
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:49,970
And then also I want to have a
conversation with you or any of my

173
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:53,930
friends are real one normal conversation
where you can talk at length with

174
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,260
somebody and you can't do that and it
seems like you're getting interrupted

175
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:59,360
nonstop.
Just again,

176
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,180
happy to.
I'm still the type of guy after shows.

177
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,330
I'll go out,
say hello to everybody talk,

178
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,350
you know,
and uh,

179
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,770
but when all my friends are around and
that's one of the great parts about the

180
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:11,060
comedy store.
And again,

181
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,570
the,
another part about the comedy store is

182
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,100
then you have to get past.
He had to be a paid regular.

183
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,440
Yeah.
It is.

184
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:19,400
Also,
there's like,

185
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,880
there's a bunch of hot spots there where
you get stuck.

186
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,020
Like if you're trying to do your set and
you're leaving the back bar and you're

187
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,120
trying to get to the,
oh,

188
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,100
are you going through that hallway?
You'll just get stuck by people with

189
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,570
cameras.
They just want to take pictures.

190
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,480
They just wait.
They just waiting like owls ready to

191
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,030
swooped down and snatched a rabbit.
They're just waiting,

192
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,953
waiting,
waiting,

193
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,420
and there's al.
Can I get a picture?

194
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,500
Can I get a picture?
And you're like,

195
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,650
I got to do.
I sat and like literally walk outside.

196
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,770
Just real quiCk.
Just real quick.

197
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,260
Like walking to the staIrs.
I've seen it.

198
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,180
Yeah.
It's like fucking crushed.

199
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,210
It really is when it's at the comedy
cellar in New York and the comedy store

200
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,280
in los angeles

201
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,530
or the best comedy clubs in the country
and if you're a comedy fan listening to

202
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:02,250
this and you,
you got to make the trip.

203
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,800
They really do because it's words on
tuesday night,

204
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,000
wednesday night,
thursday night.

205
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:08,670
You're going to see an amazing show that
could be in a stadium.

206
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,900
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

207
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:10,770
for sure.
Yeah.

208
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,250
I mean some of the,
the show someone,

209
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,310
the lineups,
like you guys have a show there next

210
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,630
wednesday,
all things comedy.

211
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,720
You,
bert kreischer,

212
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,670
who else is on?
No,

213
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,350
I'm aCtually not even unexcIting.
We go to Mexico.

214
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,170
No,
it's,

215
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,170
it's burt and bill and then you know a
couple other atc comics.

216
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,380
the united see,
but the last one we did.

217
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:34,260
You did.
And then sarah silverman was on it.

218
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,930
It was so.
It was used.

219
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:39,300
Sera silverman,
eddie pepitone like this great.

220
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,800
Meg bearer was on that one.
Yeah.

221
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,240
Yeah.
They're insane.

222
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,430
Yeah,
it was a.

223
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,090
It was.
It's a great,

224
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:47,460
great place to hang out and so I love
that.

225
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:52,461
I love doing standup and I love hanging
out with my friends and that's a huge

226
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:54,780
part.
But you feel like you're distracting

227
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,790
yourself with work.
I brought something.

228
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,670
You made a great point the other night
because I,

229
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,710
we were talking about having an
assistant.

230
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,100
You go,
I don't want to be busy enough to have

231
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,650
an assistant.
I don't want to be that busy.

232
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:11,490
When I get to assistant level in my car
thinking about assistant,

233
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,080
you take it down.
Well,

234
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,300
that's my manager.
They came up to me and they said,

235
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,860
we think you should get an assistant.
I said,

236
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,510
I'll,
I'll definitely start doing less shit.

237
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,210
I go,
let's just stop doing whatever I'm doing

238
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:23,400
that I'm doing too much,
that I need an assistant to stop.

239
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,241
And they're like,
well,

240
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:25,520
sometimes it's hard to get ahold of
yoga.

241
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,870
Well that's on purpose.
Like do you understand that?

242
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,020
Like bill murrAy has a one 800 number.
They.

243
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,070
Because they.
Yeah.

244
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,100
If you want to get ahold of bill murray,
you get the one 800 number and then

245
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:40,020
maybe he'll call you back.
really?

246
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,660
Yep.
So people leave messages on the one 800

247
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:43,494
number or something?
Yeah.

248
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,110
If you're.
I mean if you're calling about him being

249
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:49,110
in a major motion picture,
that's how you get ahold of the filmer.

250
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,670
Will bill murray apparently checked out
of relationships a few years ago?

251
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,190
We said no more relationships.
I don't want a girlfriend.

252
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,750
I don't want a wife.
I'm done.

253
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,850
He has a kid.
I guess apparently it's got an older kid

254
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,220
checked out and he moved to like North
Carolina or South Carolina,

255
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:09,330
lIke one of those fucking places and
anthony bordain interviewed him on his

256
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:09,920
show,
you know,

257
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
we had him on the show and he's like,
what are you doing down here?

258
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,380
And he's like,
I love it.

259
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
It's great.
Please call.

260
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,360
nice.
Yeah.

261
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:18,120
And he also,
for a while I was living in upstate New

262
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,160
York,
like up the hudson who would live up

263
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,570
there.
Same sort of deal.

264
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Just just I'm done like I'm just going
to live in weird spots and I'm by

265
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:30,180
myself.
So that's another reason why I'm working

266
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:35,181
my ass off is I want that I'm done,
fuck you money and I want to be able to

267
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:38,130
chill out.
I got kids on the back end of this thing

268
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,100
where they're almost out of the house.
Like I'm looking forward to that where

269
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,460
they're both going to be in college and
trying to get these little fuckers ready

270
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:47,400
for life to the point where they don't
need to come back because you hear a lot

271
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:51,000
of people who are living in their homes
with their parents until they're 30 and

272
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,400
later.
What the fuck is that?

273
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,980
Not acceptable.
I'm

274
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,890
going to push you out the door now.
Someone is 36.

275
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,210
Not good.
Yeah.

276
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:02,140
What will they're making?
Life is too good,

277
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,033
I guess.
Yeah,

278
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,270
it's too easy.
Yeah,

279
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,830
there's no.
I was listening to dr.

280
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,360
Drew talk about this on a howard stern
ramp up show and he was saying like,

281
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,690
kids don't have grit.
Grit,

282
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,583
grit.
Oh,

283
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,360
associate.
Dr drew with grit.

284
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:16,961
Well,
you're Just,

285
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:20,710
you know,
he knows about a hustle,

286
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,840
hustle and he goes,
my kids are coddled,

287
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:27,340
but he thinks the only thing is the
educational system pushing education,

288
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:30,490
make somebody work their ass off if you
don't have that inner drive.

289
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,820
And the reason like getting with me,
and this was world,

290
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,390
so if I,
I don't see a therapist,

291
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,610
I probably should because they got a lot
going on,

292
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,940
but fucking my mom was cleaning houses
and making $6 an hour.

293
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,270
My dad,
teamster,

294
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,420
warehouse foreman and uh,
they were poor growing up,

295
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,910
lower middle class and then went to the
school.

296
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,940
He sent me to school in san francisco
with all these rich kids as well as in

297
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:05,941
all these rich houses and houses in
people who know san francisco is pacific

298
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,700
heights is really nice and sold it now
it's like fucking $12,000,000 houses.

299
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:12,520
And that's where we were hanging out.
Parents would have abandoned them on the

300
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:16,120
weekends and we'd have run of these
fucking houses.

301
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,090
Just crazy.
Like my buddy broke a $25,000 vase and

302
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,730
sort of like,
let's get the fuck outta here.

303
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,990
We'll pay for it.
And we were in all these.

304
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,180
I was like smoking some guys,
cubans on sitting in his chair.

305
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm a kid from the inner sunset district
who shouldn't be all of these places.

306
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:37,921
But I think that's what lit a fire under
my aunts because I'm working for the.

307
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,660
My mom eventually has this great rags to
riches story where she was working at

308
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:48,661
this company and then she became an
account rep and then she became the head

309
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,540
account rep.

310
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,180
Then she began to vice president.
Then she bought the company and

311
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:54,940
quadrupled the company in size.
Wow.

312
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,970
And that's where I went to work for her.
Even though I wanted to be a standup

313
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,160
comic,
I go to work for her.

314
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,230
I am firing people for living,
which is a whole nother fucking thing.

315
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,190
And Just say I really was forced into
this very tough.

316
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,490
My dad and my mom were very fucking
brutal.

317
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,980
Half mexican,
half sicilian.

318
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,790
That's an I am.
And then my mom is sicilian,

319
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,990
like just the youngest sister in a with
all boys in the family.

320
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,370
Just a brutal lady who's like,
can't tell me how I tell you how many

321
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:30,880
times she said like,
fuck,

322
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:33,140
I'm just fuck them.
Like,

323
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,040
okay,
they're going to come know just a client

324
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,030
given her shit.
Like,

325
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:38,170
nah,
fuck them.

326
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,300
And they don't appreciate me.
Fuck you.

327
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,150
So was like that with us and then my
dad,

328
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,310
same thing,
they found each other for a reason

329
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,880
because they both have that attitude and
so I was there and then I was supposed

330
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:55,820
to be this eldest son taking over this
family business.

331
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,120
So when I met you in 1999,
you came up to my apartment which was in

332
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,890
telegraph.
It was a nice fucking apartment and I'm

333
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,160
like the opener with a great place.
And I lived.

334
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:08,610
I had a wet bar.
Remember?

335
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,110
Okay.
Can spot.

336
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,840
Yeah,
we smoked pot and watch old.

337
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:14,210
Oprah's oprah's whether she had big
hair,

338
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,340
huge hair,
no work done at all.

339
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,110
Just old oprah or just baked watching
fucking old oprah.

340
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,020
I hadn't even met,
like I had just met my wife at that

341
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:25,370
point.
And so this is.

342
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:26,810
Yes,
it's 1999.

343
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,100
And um,
I was working a regular job so I would

344
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:35,750
do shows on the weekend hosts the cops
or the punchline and go right back to

345
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:36,584
work.

346
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,130
And at one point I think I remember the
world started to collide.

347
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,490
Like I'm doing standup and I look out,
everybody's laughing except like three

348
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,170
dudes with their arms crossed.
I'm like,

349
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:47,270
oh shit.
Fire those fucking.

350
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,570
Yeah.
All the time dudes that you fired were

351
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:53,730
sitting in the audience said that you
started to make it into standard.

352
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,610
Like they go to see,
you know,

353
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,500
I don't think it happened and we found
me,

354
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,520
you know?
Wow.

355
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,770
They must've been fucking steaming.
Yeah.

356
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,970
Just like,
fuck that guy.

357
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,490
Everybody's laughing,
having a good set and look at just one

358
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:09,320
dude fucking scowling at me.
So creepy was that didn't mind.

359
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:09,871
Fuck you.
Yeah.

360
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:10,960
Yeah.
Know what?

361
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,650
I had such a good attitude at that
point.

362
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,970
I was like,
hey fellas.

363
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,430
Now it's a little weird.
Huh?

364
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,960
Did you talk about it?
Yeah.

365
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,200
Oh jesus.
I definitely acknowledged them and said

366
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:21,950
hello.

367
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,680
Like I knew their names and you didn't
say like,

368
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:28,580
hey,
I fired either until I can to everybody

369
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:31,190
in the entire room,
which I probably would do now.

370
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,390
Not experienced enough to handle it when
I met you.

371
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:37,880
How long had you been doing standup?
A year.

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,260
Oh wow,
that's crazy.

373
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:44,261
I just said a.
My 19th anniversary was on a tuesday.

374
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,880
Wow,
that's crazy.

375
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,300
First tuesday in may.
When did my first set went up in front

376
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,330
of like half homeless people in san
francisco at cobb's?

377
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,550
No,
at this place called the luggage store,

378
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,180
which was on market street.
Wow.

379
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,840
Tenderloin.
Full tenderloin.

380
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,540
Walked up.
I worked with you the first time I did

381
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,620
the old cops.
Yeah.

382
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,410
That place was great.
We got matched up because it was tom

383
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:11,411
sawyer used to like to like he would
make matches of he really pr.

384
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,570
I was.
He would pride himself in creating

385
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:15,820
lineups that people would.

386
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,320
People would go together and let me just
tell you something.

387
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,110
It worked once with you.
That's it.

388
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,070
All the other times were a fucking
disaster where it's like,

389
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,890
even when I was up there,
because I'd find it,

390
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:27,201
I'm like,
hey,

391
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,034
what's up?
He's like,

392
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,920
fuck,
is this guy just totally.

393
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:31,570
I can.
Yeah,

394
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,890
you put me with this fucking asshole.
Oh yeah,

395
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,140
yeah.
He put me with some,

396
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,450
you know,
there's some people that you think have

397
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:40,670
potential and then they just don't,
you know,

398
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,260
we've all,
we met guys like that.

399
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,740
I mean there's a few guys that I could
use to come up with used to come.

400
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,930
But I opened for you.
It was maddie kirsch.

401
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,100
Alright,
sure.

402
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,070
And then eddie

403
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,200
bravo fucking came on.
Well he'd come to hang out.

404
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,530
Ain't know what he was doing,
any standup,

405
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,990
but he was like a totally come to hang.
And then um,

406
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,810
I think it was down here that I met
brian and then brian started going

407
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:04,710
around.
What's you there?

408
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,570
Super early on?
Yeah.

409
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:10,680
That was when I was down in here in like
2004 and dunkin.

410
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,040
But that was the new cops as once they
started moving to the new spot in the

411
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,440
old one.
I think it was just mad.

412
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,670
Yeah.
Maddie kirsch.

413
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,880
Yeah.
Early days,

414
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:21,090
like maddie curse stopped doing standup
for a long time.

415
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:24,120
I think he's done.
I think he just completely stopped and

416
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:25,980
he stopped.
He started doing tv stuff.

417
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,860
He stopped doing standup and then he
went back to it again.

418
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:30,390
But I never saw them,
you know,

419
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,350
I think he's done.
Yeah,

420
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,330
I don't think you can dick around with
it.

421
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:38,330
I was with me and my buddies were
watching tim allen come back and you

422
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:42,990
know what I did?
He was such a nice guy and he watched

423
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,040
and he watched my sat and came up and
said bunch of stuff afterwards.

424
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,240
He was super cool to me and it was so
rough watching the set.

425
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:53,630
This was like,
he made all these santa claus movies and

426
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:57,270
he made all this shit and me and kevin
christie sent and about the.

427
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:58,104
I said,
you know what,

428
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,650
let's do something to this guy.
And we wrote them nine pages of jokes

429
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,720
and fucking just go here.
You go.

430
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,030
And handed them to him really?
And he goes,

431
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,230
thank you.
Oh my god.

432
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,650
And then we came back the next night and
he did a bunch of this shit and got an

433
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,130
applause break.
And one of my wife

434
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,310
felt so good.

435
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,670
So cool.
That's.

436
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,800
I saw him one night at the comedy store
when he hadn't done standup in for ever.

437
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:24,690
And he came back and he was doing a joke
about his ferrari breaking down.

438
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,550
A lot of people can relate to it and
listen to them.

439
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,280
Don't ever just don't do that.
I don't care if it's about a ferrari

440
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,760
breaking down.
Don't tell everybody you have a $250,000

441
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,890
car.
Well that's a big george carlin thing is

442
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:41,120
that when he got.
So we'll see an ied.

443
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,710
People going to the post office for him.
He's like,

444
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:46,140
I can't do the post office,
but now because I don't even go to the

445
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,140
fucking post office and I can't talk
about the bank because I never go to the

446
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:52,470
bank for myself.
I say like you got to do all your own

447
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:55,470
shit and just stay relatable.
It goes the other way too.

448
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,580
I was in New York and when I was out
there in the comic goes up and he was

449
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:00,690
like,
he goes,

450
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:02,280
you know what?
He's doing angel dust.

451
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,190
Like nobody knows.
Nobody knows what you're doing.

452
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:06,750
Fucking angel dust.
What are you talking about?

453
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,980
Talking about a niche audience.
Yeah,

454
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:10,210
totally.
So you know,

455
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,750
stand up like matt jumped out and it's
like,

456
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:16,020
I don't think you can jump out like it's
one of those things when you're 10,

457
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:18,780
but god damn you love it.
Like dana gould jumped out for a long

458
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,850
time and wrote for the simpsons came
back.

459
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,940
You can do it.
But you know,

460
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,630
arguably dana gould should have been a
huge superstar as a stand up comedian

461
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:30,330
using a san francisco guy who was like,
I listened to.

462
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,640
If you guys don't know that comic is,
I mean again,

463
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,150
go find it because so good.
So many voices,

464
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,970
so many characters.
So smart stories.

465
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,250
Like why met him in boston?
80 eight,

466
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,880
holy shit.
And he was already big then like he was

467
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:48,280
a headliner then and I'm doing really
well.

468
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,020
He was like rodney dangerfield,
young comedian,

469
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:52,270
special,
big,

470
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:53,500
right?
Like he was a,

471
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,690
he had a showtime special.
I remember that.

472
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,720
He had a showtime special before I moved
to la because I remember watching it and

473
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,820
it was really interesting was the way he
did.

474
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:07,510
It was like kind of unique to a shot.
it was unique and it was good.

475
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,180
It was really good and I was like,
this guy is going to be giant and I

476
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:13,150
figured it was going to be like from
their hbo specials,

477
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:15,160
from their giant theaters.
From there,

478
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:17,110
you know,
he was going to go the Brian Regan

479
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:17,791
route,
you know,

480
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,660
we're selling out all of these places,
but it just married the,

481
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,960
the woman who became ended up becoming
the president of hbo.

482
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,883
Done.
Good.

483
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,930
OnLy I have another thing.
One headshot per household.

484
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,610
Yes,
dude,

485
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,100
if you see like two,
I think tom segura and christina are the

486
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,670
ones that can pull it off to the only
ones.

487
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,880
Yeah.
I've not seen anyone else do this

488
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:45,390
successfully and I'm still standing back
like this on that one.

489
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,860
Blow up.
You got this.

490
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:51,100
You got it.
All right.

491
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,910
Well there was a kid on the daily show
that him and his wife audition for the

492
00:21:57,121 --> 00:22:00,000
daily show at the same time and he got
it and she didn't.

493
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,210
Oh yeah.
In fun time in that house.

494
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,070
Not good.
Not good at all.

495
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:09,370
If somebody starts becoming super
popular and then the other person is

496
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:09,910
like,
oh,

497
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,430
what do I do?
Do I present that kirsch do like jump

498
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:17,200
out now or find other work and that's
also been a difficult thing with me.

499
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:19,120
So back to what we were talking about
and it's like,

500
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,500
so now I leave this parent's family
business and I come to la,

501
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,460
I could have again,
I could have been up there and miserable

502
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,110
fucking with firing people nonstop and
taking on other people's problems

503
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:35,260
because that's what I did is like if you
have a business or you work somewhere,

504
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:37,090
we'd employ everybody working there.

505
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,830
So You didn't have to deal with any of
the headaches.

506
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,120
But then I got all the headaches so I've
been chased like a.

507
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:48,121
I had a guy who was a time when knees,
like he sick this banner.

508
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,510
He was working in a doctor's office,
but on the weekends we found out he was

509
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:57,490
pretending he was the doctor.
Are you seeing patients?

510
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,740
His own patients?
But he was a physical therapy and uh,

511
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,040
um,
orthopedists office.

512
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,130
So I go in there and I've been doing
this awhile.

513
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,200
And again,
no,

514
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,960
just been in so many awkward situations.
Now I'm doing stand up and I'm even more

515
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:13,900
awkward situations and I just go up and
I go,

516
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,080
hey twon,
you know,

517
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,020
jig is up.
Go.

518
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,900
Today's your last day.
We found out what you're doing.

519
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,120
He grabs me,
puts me up against the wall,

520
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,700
he gets one of those physical therapy
sticks,

521
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,340
you know,
the big,

522
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,470
like the pole that you stretch with
behind your back and stuff.

523
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,950
And he has one of those cut In half and
he sticks it right up to my throat and

524
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,480
now I'm cool.
And so I go,

525
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,210
twan,
I got you got two choices here.

526
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,740
You're going to hit me with that stick
and I'm going to call the cops and I'm

527
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:46,460
going to charges.
you're going to go to jail.

528
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,010
Does that mean to be pissy?
Hit me with that fucking stick.

529
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,060
Or you can take the final check that's
in my breast pocket right here and walk

530
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:54,440
away.
What's it going to be?

531
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,920
and I'm held up against a wall by my
throat with the fucking stick in my

532
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:00,960
face.
And so had some crazy situation.

533
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:03,470
So what did you say to him?
You said the jig is up.

534
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,510
I know you're not a real doctor.
Yeah.

535
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,344
I go,
hey,

536
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,530
how you doing?
You shouldn't be here right now know

537
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,550
you're seeing response.
No,

538
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,780
this is not true.
These,

539
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,690
you know,
like in july we spoke english.

540
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,060
Yeah.
She's a physical therapist bangiNg

541
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:18,710
chicks to.
I have no idea.

542
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,670
I would like it to be that waY.
Yeah.

543
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,960
That's a better story if there's a way
to heal you.

544
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,920
So I didn't rush it.
Nurses running from me and just crazy

545
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:32,780
stories like why would they try to do to
you?

546
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,810
Uh,
well this russian nurse was in an

547
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:40,130
allergist office and she was giving
wrong doses to the kids and stuff of

548
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:41,130
shots.
Oh jeez.

549
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,460
All my documentation like these yellow
pads.

550
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,280
I goes,
there's um,

551
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,250
who you can see,
right?

552
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,320
I'm 22 years old.
you can see right here.

553
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,410
Then she tries to grab it.
Now it's a tug of war across a desk and

554
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:54,210
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
And um,

555
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,920
she takes off and runs down a haLlway
and I'm 22 and shit.

556
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,820
I fucking run down the hAllway
afterwards and she goes into a patient

557
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:04,340
room and didn't.
She locks the door and then I get the

558
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:07,640
door open and assist somebody unlock and
she's in there and she's talking to her

559
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:09,110
husband on the phone.
she goes through,

560
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,630
there is a mum here who's telling me
lies.

561
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,643
He's telling me like

562
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,540
I didn't want them to you,
these pregnant and the baby because of

563
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,230
these moms like that.
I'm going

564
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,843
totally

565
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,480
freaking out.
Oh my god.

566
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,660
I had a tea to teach.
A bunch of vietnamese people had to.

567
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,570
Shit.
There was one day I got a call,

568
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,050
got a call from this guy.
The issue.

569
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,330
Well they were her mungs.
Okay.

570
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,210
You know her mom is like this.
If you saw grand torino,

571
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:44,150
that movie with clint eastwood,
I think the h is silent,

572
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:45,350
I think.
Right?

573
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,050
The a h,
m o,

574
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:51,620
u n g,
and then there are people without a

575
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:52,860
land.
Yeah.

576
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,100
And then they go.
Came to san jose,

577
00:25:55,101 --> 00:26:00,101
California to working assembly plants.
So they're in this cable assembly plant,

578
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,120
a plant called cable co.
That was a big client of ours and I got

579
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,070
a call from this really cool guy,
his name is chip,

580
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,960
chip bronc,
and he goes,

581
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,540
well you got to get down here,
you're not going to fucking believe it.

582
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,890
And I got a situation and I go,
what is it?

583
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:15,440
And it goes better.
you see

584
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,570
going into the bathroom.
Shit everywhere.

585
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,400
What?
Because they had never been used to

586
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,710
toilets.
So they were standing on the toilet

587
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:27,220
seats.
I found out that's what was going on.

588
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,680
They all had fake names,
like the names,

589
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,590
food,
cli,

590
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,090
but you can call me keith.

591
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,830
Hey keith fluidly.
Can you come here for a second?

592
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,370
Can I start you about this shit
everywhere.

593
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,420
Like on the ground?
Yeah,

594
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:46,421
they were missing.
So toilet seat is not meant to fucking

595
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,010
hold you up.
So they're waddling up there standing on

596
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:52,980
the standing on the toilet.
So they were just used to like shitting

597
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:55,030
and shitting and holes.
Oh my god,

598
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,943
they're lucky,
you know,

599
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,840
in the woods or whatever.
So,

600
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,190
so lucky.
Not lucky where they hold them forever.

601
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,340
So yeah,
just backed up his becomes a brick.

602
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,600
Yeah.
So,

603
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:08,040
um,
anyway,

604
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,670
I gathered everybody around,
I just appointed a bathroom monitor and

605
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,520
oh my god,
bathroom monitors.

606
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:15,810
So I had one of the guys who was the
supervisor,

607
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,770
I had a clipboard,
I put a lock on the bathroom door and

608
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,720
then.
so you become this corporate fixer.

609
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,810
That's what I was doing and I always
wanted to do standup comedy.

610
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,610
I love standup comedy.
I grew up in the city which is listening

611
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:31,260
to the comedians on the radio and all
the great comics was to comics who lived

612
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:33,450
on my block.
And so I love lived on your block.

613
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,150
Mike pritchard and michael.
Me and two great comics.

614
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:38,970
Mike pritchard,
one the first san francisco comedy

615
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:42,110
competition.
And robin williams looked up to him.

616
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,020
He was like robin williams.
That was his idol and he was on my

617
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:47,500
block.
And you don't money hoffman.

618
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,480
Yeah,
money.

619
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:51,390
Hoffman.
I'll be eight years old on my bike and

620
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:54,450
I'd ride down the block and money.
Hoffman and mike pritchard used to put

621
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:57,440
their tee shirts over their heads.
You know how you can do with just the,

622
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,230
the whole face pops out of the hole.
And they used to pretend they were the

623
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:05,250
California raisin guys.
You guys are hilarious.

624
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,120
This is amazing.

625
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,570
They lived on your block on my block.
And I remember.

626
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,690
Where's pritchard now?
I think he's a motivational speaker.

627
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,880
is still up in the bay area.
Lead lives in marin.

628
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,750
He came To the last night at cobb's
comedy club in that little spot.

629
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,150
Why you stopped doing standup?
I just speaks.

630
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,411
Wow.
Weird.

631
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:23,790
Yeah.
So,

632
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,900
um,
well,

633
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:27,070
you know,
that's another tempting thing for me too

634
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:29,010
is because I do a ton of corporate
standup,

635
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,620
I get you can get paid,
you know,

636
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,980
five figures to deep five figures to
speak at 3:30 PM and do stand up at a

637
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:42,030
thing and you know,
if your standup career,

638
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:45,090
like you're in a good,
amazing spot because people come to see

639
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:49,320
you.
Like I'm still at the stage where I go

640
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:54,000
out and 40 percent other people,
they're come to cv and it's a weird

641
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:57,960
cross section of people who love stand
up or you know,

642
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:00,900
heard me,
you heard me on burt's podcasts or your

643
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:01,611
podcast,
you know,

644
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:02,444
whaTever.

645
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,900
And then it's a weird cross section,
a daily show people and then sitcom

646
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,530
people and then,
you know what I mean?

647
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:09,600
It's like this weird crowd coming
together.

648
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,020
and then it's um,
it's people like comedy.

649
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:17,960
It said stan hope bit people.
How many people came here to see me and,

650
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,530
and when many people came here to see
comedy.

651
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,570
Yeah.
And he's like,

652
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:27,840
music isn't like that.
And so for me to do a corporate gig and

653
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:30,340
pay get paid double gazillion,
you know,

654
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:34,500
like a lot of money is fucking tempting
to switch over to that side.

655
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:36,900
So I could see why people do that.
That's what jay leno did.

656
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,860
You just get paid 250 grand and that's
why he doesn't put out any content.

657
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,661
Jay.
Oh.

658
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:43,420
Doesn't have the same act he has.
No,

659
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,990
he has no body of Work.
Like he had a showtime special that he

660
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:51,991
did that I saw in the nineties and I'm
pretty sure other than his tonight show

661
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:53,740
monologues,
which of course has numerous.

662
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,450
I think that's the last stand up.
Did he ever put out as far as like a,

663
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,790
like a full act?
Talk to him about it.

664
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,040
yeah.
He's kind of weird philosophy about it.

665
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,100
I did random,
randomly got a phone call to present him

666
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:13,420
with his mark twain award at the kennedy
center.

667
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,570
Oh wow.
It was me fucking seinfeld,

668
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,120
jimmy fallon,
seTh meyers.

669
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,070
I'm like crazy people.
It's,

670
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,930
you know,
wanda sykes and I had no business being

671
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,390
there.
Chelsea handler was doing whatever,

672
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,840
just like an all stars and I'd never met
him before and I think they just wanted

673
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:36,010
to color it up,
but I'm going to say yes because it's

674
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:38,290
fucking kennedy center and super super
cool.

675
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,380
And I got there and I meet them for the
first time and then my act was like,

676
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,750
what are you doing?
Like you have $250,000,000 or something

677
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:50,380
like that.

678
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,040
And You still,
every sunday you go to the comedy magic

679
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:56,140
club,
you don't turn over your act.

680
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:58,260
You got separate comedy,
money in tv,

681
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,750
money in this car collection.
I go,

682
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,810
what,
what do you like?

683
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,770
Just chill out,
man.

684
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,300
Yeah.
And uh,

685
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:09,390
I,
can you give me the fucking $4,000,000?

686
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:14,391
You never see me again?
And it goes sold from the balcony and

687
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,770
then we had a long conversation about it
afterwards,

688
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:22,600
which was super weird and talked about
that exact same thing that you just

689
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,250
discussed is that he has an act that he
wants to keep doing and if it never

690
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:30,250
appears on tv,
you've got to go see him to see it.

691
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,870
But people get mad when they see him
twice.

692
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,760
Oh yeah.
Like uh,

693
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,240
he was in edmonton.
He did the river cree and then he did it

694
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:42,370
again a year later and he did the same
act.

695
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,440
And uh,
the people that were mad.

696
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,370
Well that's just,
I mean,

697
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,920
for,
for those old school guys,

698
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,030
that's how you did it.
I mean,

699
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,910
it's not a no knock against him.
That's how everybody did it.

700
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,260
It can't skills guys and vaudeville,
they build.

701
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,510
Those guys would do the same act for 10
years.

702
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:01,600
And it was also,
you could do other people's asks.

703
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,400
Yes.
Right.

704
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,810
Yeah,
they just did.

705
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,840
They have did that,
you know,

706
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,910
they will social media when the
abbott and costello did who's on first

707
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,210
on tv 20 other guys were pissed because
they also did that exact same bit.

708
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,653
Really?
Yeah.

709
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,610
And they're like,
thanks a lot fellas.

710
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,010
I could never fucking do that thing.
And so who's on first?

711
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:35,011
Wasn't an abbott and costello original.
Was there 20 other duets doing that

712
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:38,130
exact same fucking material?
Wow.

713
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,440
Yeah.
So now let's complete jay leno courses

714
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,313
carrying that.

715
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,100
You're pissed.
When I started in san francisco is great

716
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:48,460
guy.
Jimmy cornet who ran the punchline,

717
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,830
we were talking about other people
coming through and not changing their

718
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:53,600
act and he goes,
dude,

719
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:58,660
you need a new 20 minutes.
At least every time we come through here

720
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,160
people are going to be pissed.
They want to see the hits.

721
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,940
And this would obviously would say we go
see the stones,

722
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,960
you want to see brown sugar,
but you got to mix in some fucking new

723
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:13,040
shit every once in a while to comments
or feel like they less want to see the

724
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:17,450
hits more than anything with music.
Like they actually just want to see the

725
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:18,980
hits,
like if you go to see the stones,

726
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:22,850
they don't want to hear any new stones
shifts once satisfaction.

727
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,470
But if you go to see bird,
you want to see all this new stuff.

728
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,740
Yeah.
You're familiar to.

729
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,740
You saw his last netflix.
Exactly.

730
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

731
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:34,790
It's interesting.
So that keeps us creative.

732
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,250
It keeps you fresh.
You have to constantly be hustling.

733
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,630
Totally.
Yeah.

734
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,970
It's um,
that's what I say when I saw you the

735
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:45,971
other night when you did that atc show.
You had that funny.

736
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:47,720
No vagina bit.

737
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,510
Thanks man.
That was because again,

738
00:33:52,511 --> 00:33:54,770
and that's another thing,
it's like you grow up in san francisco

739
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:57,710
when you become like,
you see guys coming through and I

740
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:59,270
watched,
I went to see everybody.

741
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:03,290
So I lived in between comms and the
punchline and that's where I did.

742
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:03,861
If you,
you know,

743
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:06,510
outliers 10,000 hours.
Yeah.

744
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,470
Walk to the cops.
I know for.

745
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:14,471
I did this for maybe 13 months straight
almost every single night I walked the

746
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:18,230
comps.
Then I'd walk to the punchline and I saw

747
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,940
every single act saw damon wayans.
Carlos mitzia is scott,

748
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,290
you know,
for kids in the hall.

749
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,140
What's his face?
got to thompson said just anybody who

750
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:27,980
would come through.
I go see,

751
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,840
I can see every single night and I want
you to good ones.

752
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,600
I took something from everybody,
but then I sort of watched people come

753
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:35,330
through a second time and not change
anything.

754
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,620
I stopped to watch features that were
better than the headliner and feature,

755
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,410
you know,
the conversation over in the corner and

756
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:45,500
fucking just watching it all and it just
again,

757
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,660
you see what people are doing and how
much work people put into this.

758
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:54,410
It's a tremendous amount of work,
but to do the bits also.

759
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:57,680
And that's another thing is like san
francisco,

760
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,410
you wouldn't put hacky comics up.
Right?

761
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,690
They wouldn't get to play there.
Sawyer wouldn't fucking work here

762
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,070
for good reason.
I really appreciated that about him.

763
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,360
It's one of the reasons whY I was
willing to go back and do his clubs so

764
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,560
many times.
Yeah.

765
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:16,100
SO again,
that's when you come to la and you're

766
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,400
like,
what the fuck is this?

767
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,190
There's some of that like what we were
talking about,

768
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:22,400
we don't need to name any names,
but that one person who just as a bunch

769
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,830
of shit and says it fast and then you're
like,

770
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,760
okay,
what?

771
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,310
What are you doing?
You're ruining the night.

772
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,210
There's a lot of tricks,
tricks you're saying a bunch of pop

773
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:37,211
culture references and a bunch of shit,
but there's no like so hard to be

774
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:40,380
judgmental about someone else's craft or
art,

775
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:45,381
but there's times when you know whether
someone is actually trying to work

776
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:48,880
something out or whether they're trying
to trick the audience too.

777
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,960
There's a bunch of stuff You guys that
you can do to elicit laughter and you

778
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:56,610
can memorize a huge string.
It's called.

779
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:58,680
Yeah,
it's a string and you can just fucking

780
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:02,160
rattled some done and then they got a
big applause.

781
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:05,090
Bah ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.
What?

782
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:06,700
I did,
what I did after that.

783
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,690
What did you do this.
I don't want to be like this.

784
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,380
I just want to read,
write and jack reacher on my deck and

785
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:18,360
fucking chill out and I bought that fga
62 land cruiser and I want to fucking

786
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:20,850
just,
I want to get a little trailer behind

787
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:22,740
that.
I want to go to big sur with my wife's

788
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:24,630
go chill out by the ocean.
Chill out.

789
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,310
Yeah.
I want to be that guy,

790
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,490
but you're not,
but I'm not.

791
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,630
I'm not.
I really want to be.

792
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,170
Anyway,
I followed that.

793
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,650
Yeah.
One comic we're talking about and I

794
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:40,950
walked out and I go,
how bad it I go,

795
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,270
name.
I go,

796
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,360
what was that last applause?
Break all about the offer to donate some

797
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:50,361
money to charity.
Just for no reason.

798
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,940
You shouldn't have done it.
Just shouldn't talk shit.

799
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,290
well,
I think the only time you should talk to

800
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,070
is when someone's doing something
negative.

801
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,630
Like stealing.
Yeah.

802
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,460
You know,
I mean we've all been there before.

803
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:04,500
When you see someone go up and you go,
okay,

804
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:06,120
that's not even your act.
Yeah.

805
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,010
Yeah.
It happens less now than ever before.

806
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,100
Don't think this is like the cleanest
time for comedy as far as like,

807
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,190
you're still hear little stories pop up
here and there,

808
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:21,470
but I think it's also now it's
subjective and there's lunch.

809
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,620
So much standup.

810
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,080
I was thinking like I have this hour
special coming out,

811
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:30,430
um,
this weekend on showtime and I think

812
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,200
talking to somebody about it and there's
a special coming out like every fucking

813
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,110
two days.
Yeah,

814
00:37:35,111 --> 00:37:39,900
they're not that special anymore or not,
but it's a great time for content.

815
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,980
Like if you want to see comedy,
like you go on netflix or showtime or

816
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,160
cso or any of these different providers
to cecil.

817
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:52,530
If I could stand then stand up special.
And I watched the and mentioned it as

818
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:55,330
they go.
The doug stan hope special on.

819
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:00,240
So if you have not seen this,
I feel like is one of the best things

820
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:05,550
I've ever seen.
And I walked in to the comedy club and

821
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:10,551
he saw punchline for the very first time
and I saw arch barker onstage kill just,

822
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:13,950
he's a great comic.
He's just fucking murdered.

823
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,970
And I had the same feeling that when I
watched that doug stanhope special,

824
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,760
oh,
just I haven't seen it.

825
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,290
I need to see it,
my god,

826
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:27,270
the bills just again.
And it's like next level shit that I

827
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,300
hope people can really appreciate the
call backs and the intricacies of this

828
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:36,280
Whole thing and the story in somebody
who's on something and saying

829
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,800
something like.
But doug did two of them in his

830
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,530
hometown.
He did them bolt in bisbee,

831
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,311
right?
Yeah.

832
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:46,520
This is the one that was shot in bisbee
by a head again.

833
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,570
You know,
it's just.

834
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,420
I love the fact that he's doing that.
like we talked about it a couple of

835
00:38:51,421 --> 00:38:54,880
years ago is I can park in my town.
I just got to fucking see these people

836
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:57,730
at the safe way.
And then apparently he just said,

837
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,050
fuck it,
why not?

838
00:38:59,051 --> 00:39:02,860
Why can't I do it in my town?
And then eventually his town stopped

839
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:05,380
being the talent was.
And as a bunch of people who moved there

840
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:07,600
because they know doug lives there.
Oh dude.

841
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,370
First of all,
he's a real estate mogul.

842
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,880
He bought everY house that comes up.
They're all like $30,000.

843
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:15,010
He just buys it.
He's just buying houses.

844
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,860
So he owns like,
I think you want six or seven houses in

845
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:20,590
town.
This is with jack reacher novel where

846
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,300
he's going to own the town.
Good time.

847
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,210
Fuck dude.
If I got divorced,

848
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:27,630
I thought I'd seriously consider moving
there.

849
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,740
There's already a house I'm looking at.
It's a cave.

850
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,240
No way to indicate when it's Built into
a cake.

851
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,113
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

852
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,750
Now I can't buy it because people know
they'll show up at my door.

853
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,020
But uh,
he,

854
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,180
uh,
so many people move to bit.

855
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,360
He used to give out his address and say,
come into my superbowl party.

856
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:50,260
So people would come from all over the
world to his fucKing superbowl party.

857
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:53,200
And it was ridiculous.
It'd be 500 people that he didn't know

858
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,910
at his house for a superbowl party.
So he stopped doing that.

859
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,970
He rescinded the invitation.
That's what me and bert were talking

860
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:05,971
about is doing a thing called a caravan
comedy tour and getting a bunch of rvs

861
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,880
and our trucks and trailers and just
going a bunch of guys because also

862
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,800
sudden it's like just a special kind of
comic.

863
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,180
You're,
you're one of those comics.

864
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:19,750
It's like you have give kids,
you have a family of life,

865
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,920
you have stuff outside of standup,
you know,

866
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,780
sake to get those guys together.
And bert is one of those,

867
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:26,640
you know,
we're like,

868
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,530
you have a couple kids and like get the
kids and the wives,

869
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,790
it takes a lot to be a comedian wife and
they all have that in common,

870
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,020
so I'm sure everyone would get along
great because they have to deal with us

871
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,000
and so the wives and the kids,
everybody in rv and then we all go out

872
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:46,890
and do shows and then everybody gets to
go to the grand canyon,

873
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,660
the next
bad idea,

874
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:50,310
bad idea.

875
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,950
And then duncan,
we talked about dunkin doesn't have any

876
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,671
kids.
I know,

877
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:57,070
but he's got a dog will be still be fun
on the road.

878
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,860
Yeah,
that's a great idea man.

879
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,930
So you know,
I just wanted an excuse to buy one of

880
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:03,280
those airstreams.
Totally.

881
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,640
I just think they look bad ass.
Well I build upon your fj 62.

882
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:09,190
Oh my god.
I don't think I haven't been.

883
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,740
I got business cards.
I'm looking at.

884
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,090
There's a place called off the grid
rentals and just to test out,

885
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,100
but it's too small.
It's like this teardrop.

886
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,620
It's a four by 14.
So you can put a rooftop tent on top of

887
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,990
it.
Has the ladder that goes up.

888
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,920
Yeah.
And then I could just have everybody.

889
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,970
I'm thinking I want a little bit more
surreal one.

890
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,970
Well I've been going to the differences.
Sports mobile,

891
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,450
if you go to sportsman will bill.com,
which is fucking dirt.

892
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,400
They've been doing it for a long time
but you can get one of those dodge

893
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:39,970
sprinter vans,
a diesel truck down

894
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,030
and get that four by four it out and
just go.

895
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:45,560
And then you could still tell some
stuff.

896
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,280
So there's this company called fuck it.
What is the company called?

897
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:54,281
There's aN expedition vehicle that they
take and they take like a ford f 2:50

898
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,460
and then they put this thing on top of
the roof,

899
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:03,080
lIke the like above the front cab.
It goes up and then back know exactly

900
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:07,040
what you're saying.
It's got solar power and a generator and

901
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,890
you can live in those fucking things.
It's all ready to rock.

902
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,650
There's a rock climber guys.
Look at that fucking thing.

903
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,770
Jesus christ.
Oh my god.

904
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:18,350
I'm in love with a rooftop tent.
Yeah,

905
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:22,130
and will they do that too?
They take vans and there's a company

906
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:24,350
called u joint off road.

907
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,970
They take a van like that.
They remove the natural suspension or

908
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,950
suspension that comes with it and put a
full on dual solid axle.

909
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,750
Four wheel drive suspension setup in.
Uh huh.

910
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:40,850
And you could just drive that
motherfucker xmmobile.com and take a

911
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:43,790
look at this now because this is what
they used to do and they're still doing

912
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:47,010
with some of these.
The vans Will do this.

913
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,050
That looks amazing words.
But if you look at what they're doing

914
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:53,870
with the mercedes and the dodge
sprinter,

915
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,330
that's when it just goes up to a whole
nother level.

916
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,610
Downsize other sites down.
Oh yeah.

917
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,090
But you can see soMe of them.
Yeah.

918
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,780
Like it just fucking.
I like.

919
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,850
Yep.
I like it.

920
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:08,050
I have those same ideas,
but I do go on these trips for hunting

921
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,590
where I go out in the woods five,
six days at a time and most of the time

922
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:13,880
there's no cell phone service.

923
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,520
I just did bordaiN,
uh,

924
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,180
with the crew that you guys shot with in
Montana.

925
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,560
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

926
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:23,930
What'd you do?
I did his uh,

927
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,730
no reservation.
Yeah.

928
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,770
Well it's called,
um,

929
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,670
what is it called now?
Parts and parts unknown.

930
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:29,504
Yeah.
Where'd you go?

931
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,890
What'd you do?
We just say it was mexican food down on

932
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,050
of street.
Oh,

933
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:34,010
nice.
Nice.

934
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,990
Yeah,
we went bird hunting in Montana.

935
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,600
It was fun.
So interesting that,

936
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,120
that guy's still goes hard.
Yeah.

937
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,480
Hard.
Like I'm throwing them back.

938
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:44,620
We got so high I thought I could feel
the earth benning will.

939
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,880
He had just come from.
He was super late.

940
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:49,410
I got drunk.
If you watch this parts unknown,

941
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,420
I'm fucking wasted
up.

942
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,290
People are like,
why is that magical?

943
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:59,990
His eyes closed kind of super drunk.
He was four hours late and I just went

944
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:04,070
to bars with that crew while we were
waiting for him because he got a tattoo

945
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,420
and then he showed up super late and
then we ate to ketos and by the time he

946
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:09,650
got there I was just trashed.

947
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,880
I'm the biggest lightweight of all time.
It really is true.

948
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,810
I did a show with you had the comedy
magic club.

949
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,280
We walked around the corner and got
baked with red band and then I went back

950
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:24,470
in and I had to apologize to your
audience.

951
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:29,471
I go,
I've been so busy,

952
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,890
been able to get back like I used to and
it just fucking snuck up on me.

953
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:37,570
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
Where you can stock up.

954
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,330
You could sneak up on you.
Easy today.

955
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,740
Yeah,
and like people are productive.

956
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,710
Doug benson is A producTive
motherfuCker.

957
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,010
He gets a lot done.
I can't speak.

958
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,510
I'll just leave that there.

959
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,010
Yeah,
I get it.

960
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:54,630
I mean,
some people are much more comfortable

961
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:57,570
with joey.
Joey diaz is constantly in that state.

962
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,600
I saw him who senT me a picture of it.
If it was a.

963
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,330
Somebody showed me something that he was
in the noodles.

964
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,290
Big gummy bear,
dude,

965
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:12,350
that has 3000,
300 milligrams milligrams of thc in that

966
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:17,460
thing and you'd like chop the head off
and he does that all the time that he

967
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:18,720
stopped doing that though,
by the way,

968
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,410
joe.
He stopped.

969
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,030
He backed off the edibles.
Oh really?

970
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,190
Yeah,
just tax.

971
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,791
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

972
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,870
I can't,
I have such.

973
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,530
I'm been waking.
I just went to the doctor.

974
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:28,710
I a little bit of a health scare and
this is two days ago,

975
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,870
uh,
because I've been waking up in the

976
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:33,140
middle of the night out of breath.
Yeah.

977
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,850
Oh,
you probably have sleep apnea at that or

978
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:39,990
I get a sleep study that's being done
and then I'm just saying I have anxiety

979
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,910
and we definitely have anxiety.

980
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:42,810
Yeah,
a lot of it.

981
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:44,580
You ever thought about doing like yoga
or anything?

982
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:45,960
Um,
I try to go to the gym.

983
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:50,910
I go to the gYm every morning,
but I don't like I need to meditate and

984
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,600
people have talked to me about
transcendental meditation and stuff like

985
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:56,370
that that I need to settle the fuck
down.

986
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,510
YeAh,
they.

987
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,810
But you know that you have this thing
and you're not doing anything.

988
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,540
I'm not doing anything about it.
And the doctor said that this is good.

989
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,850
now you're finally being compelled to
talk about it with Somebody that is a

990
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:13,320
problem and you feel like you're angry
at yourself for being so anxious.

991
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,820
Because if I go to the airport with my
wife and kidS,

992
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,980
I could feel it.
I feel my anxiety.

993
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:23,670
I feel myself freaking the fuck out.
Wow.

994
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,230
When you freak out,
like what's the thought?

995
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,680
What are you worried about?
We got to get through and everybody

996
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,720
slowing us down.
I go early.

997
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:34,230
I know that's what I started doing it.
That's why I'm like trying to prepare

998
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,620
myself was so huge.
Just leave an hour earlier than you need

999
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:42,510
to and you don't give a shit and I still
look at my wife from like the last

1000
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,590
couple of times,
like doing pretty good.

1001
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,220
I'm working on it.
It's weird.

1002
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,550
It seems like maybe you were set up for
this from like your early career,

1003
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,230
like this,
like tension,

1004
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,950
you know,
and then the desire for success like to

1005
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:59,200
be a successful comic is a lot of
hustling and does a lot of life.

1006
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,410
You've got to fuckIng,
you gotta be on your point.

1007
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,060
You got to be on your game.
He had a look around,

1008
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:05,670
go,
go,

1009
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:06,330
go,
go.

1010
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:10,520
And now with atc again,
I feel so much responsibility for all

1011
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,950
these comics and things.
So we have 50 podcasts.

1012
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:16,530
We have 50 live comedian.
That thing down for sure.

1013
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,860
I tried.
That'S another thing where you getting

1014
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,140
calls.
I did 20 percent at least.

1015
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,210
Right?
Everybody's like,

1016
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,050
okay,
here's,

1017
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,350
here's a perfect fucking example.
Like ian edwards has a podcast called

1018
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:30,184
soccer comic.

1019
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,070
I'm not going to.
I love ian edwards to death.

1020
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,250
Right?
[inaudible].

1021
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,330
He's on that note.
I don't care for people listening that

1022
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:39,430
fucking show.
He's on that network.

1023
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:39,910
I don't.
Okay.

1024
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,870
I don't give a shit.
Yeah.

1025
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:44,260
I feel the same way and so I don't care
about the numbers as much as I believe

1026
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,880
in the comics,
likE there's two comedians,

1027
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:46,714
michael,
constant,

1028
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,670
mike and chris fairbanks that I want to
start making tv like they're not on tv.

1029
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,970
Costs is a funny dude.
This is a funny motherfucker and I have

1030
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:58,590
a great story with costa.
So um,

1031
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,730
this is how we met me and bill burr
first comes to

1032
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,720

1033
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,740

then sees me onstage,

1034
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,210
did some bit about how my wife's half
korean,

1035
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:18,100
half greek and I go,
I might add this korean mother in law

1036
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,940
and I don't do any jokes about her
because then I'd be doing margaret cho's

1037
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,260
jay,
I act and who wants that

1038
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:29,690
shithead
fucking.

1039
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,750
He loves it and I can't.
That's fucking hilarious.

1040
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:42,330
We go now I'm at the point in la,
you guys like I'm doing spots,

1041
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:46,470
I'm not doing anything else.
And so I'm working on these tv shows as

1042
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,610
much as I can,
but when I'm not,

1043
00:48:47,611 --> 00:48:50,670
I'm at the comedy store two cents.
Then I go to the laugh factory,

1044
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:53,400
then I go to the improv.
I'm doing that triangle and I'm hitting

1045
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:56,220
them all and I had the ice house,
like I'm going everywhere.

1046
00:48:56,221 --> 00:49:01,221
I'M a guy who's doing like 12 sets a
week and this is from 2004 until I get

1047
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,950
the daily show,
pretty much like this is a good solid

1048
00:49:04,951 --> 00:49:09,951
six or seven years of just fucking going
and then go to the improv and bill

1049
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,380
again.
New I go,

1050
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:15,330
let's go to the improv.
It's fucking go down there.

1051
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,030
and so he jumps in my car.
We drove down to the improv.

1052
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,240
It's a show that they're doing where
they show a sketch comedy video and then

1053
00:49:23,971 --> 00:49:27,940
they bring up a standup and then they
show a sketch comedy video and a stand

1054
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,520
up and my cost as the host.

1055
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:33,360
So I go up in between these sets and I
look at them and I go,

1056
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:34,710
heY,
do you know if they're going to show

1057
00:49:34,711 --> 00:49:36,330
another video?
Are they going to bring me up?

1058
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,240
And then he responds,
I forget what he says,

1059
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:41,760
but then he goes up on stage and he
goes,

1060
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:44,880
okay,
this next comedian is,

1061
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:48,390
um,
I guess it's al magic guy.

1062
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,450
If You want me to pronounce your name
right,

1063
00:49:50,451 --> 00:49:52,780
you got to come introduce yourself to me
before the shit.

1064
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,260
I can'T be expected to this.
I don't know if it's a guy or a girl and

1065
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,990
I'm on the side losing it and I go,
fuck you.

1066
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,453
And he goes,
what?

1067
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,610
I go,
you heard me fuck this room full of

1068
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,190
asian night or something.
Like there's all these chinese people

1069
00:50:08,191 --> 00:50:09,930
there.
And so I go,

1070
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:12,210
everybody turns and I go,
you heard me?

1071
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,100
Fuck you.
I go do Your job.

1072
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:17,220
I introduced myself to you like,
just get the fuck off stage.

1073
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:19,983
And I go,
what?

1074
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:23,250
Because he's like,
I don't know if it's a guy or a girl.

1075
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:24,960
Who are you going to go,
dude,

1076
00:50:24,961 --> 00:50:27,230
you're the fucking host.
Figure it out,

1077
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,380
right asshole.
So I walk up and I proceed to just lay

1078
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:38,180
into him.
Just fucking 15 minutes are about the

1079
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:41,870
guy or girl,
you're the host.

1080
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,860
It's all you have one fucking job to do.
Bills hunched over,

1081
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:47,680
laughing on the side.
we're going to.

1082
00:50:47,681 --> 00:50:51,590
all the comics in the back are just.
See there's tables In the back or on the

1083
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,990
floor.
And it's the echo,

1084
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,490
it's fucking asian night.
This is the worst crowd scenes that

1085
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,700
atlanta like just going crazy and I
can't help it.

1086
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,220
Again,
if anyone's listening to this guy's an

1087
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:05,810
asshole,
I don't want to be.

1088
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,360
I want to do that.
right.

1089
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:12,460
It just came out compelled
uncontrollable fucking burst of fucking

1090
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:16,950
telling people this asshole continuous.
Yeah.

1091
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,380
Right,
right.

1092
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,590
Yeah.
And I could've,

1093
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,410
I could've gone.
I'm right here.

1094
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,690
Sorry about that.
Magical,

1095
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,190
magical.
no problem.

1096
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,520
Just bring me up.
Yeah.

1097
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:29,090
But that puts you in a bad position.
You go up there like sort of.

1098
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,490
Yeah.
Like they can submitting.

1099
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,830
Yeah.
It's willie barcelona had those storIes

1100
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:37,370
about like headbutting somebody in the
hallway because they brought up charles

1101
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:39,060
fleischer instead of him.
You know,

1102
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,640
he will.
It's crazy.

1103
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,503
Well,
yeah,

1104
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,210
that's a whole nother thing.
Like,

1105
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,630
I think I told that story last time I
was on his podcast were I told him to

1106
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,230
fuck off and he's an east la street
fighter.

1107
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,960
So I.
Yeah,

1108
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,540
it doesn't matter.
I don't think when I see red they

1109
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:58,190
fucking started telling everybody,
fuck you.

1110
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,160
So anyway,
I'm being my costa.

1111
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,950
Very good friends.
To this day I came up,

1112
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,070
I mean,
I see the error of my ways right away

1113
00:52:07,071 --> 00:52:08,880
and I go,
apologize and go deal.

1114
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,140
Can't control It.
I'm sorry.

1115
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:15,740
I see crazy shit people.
And so again,

1116
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,300
when you and I have never had a
weirdness,

1117
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:22,280
weird moment happens with very few
people,

1118
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:24,260
but when it does,
when you feel slighted.

1119
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,500
Yeah,
yeah,

1120
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,040
yeah.
I've never slighted you like,

1121
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,580
and if you.
No,

1122
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,460
no you haven't.
Yeah.

1123
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,420
But yeah.
I don't know.

1124
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,680
Again,
I want to just,

1125
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:34,100
just to,
uh,

1126
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,930
consider.
I know that feeling though.

1127
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:38,180
There's a feeling,
especially like the anxiety before

1128
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:39,320
you're performing,
you're,

1129
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:41,510
you're ready to go.
And then someone that you feel lIke

1130
00:52:41,511 --> 00:52:42,800
someone's fucking with you and you're
like,

1131
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,910
oh,
okay.

1132
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,810
I've had that happen before where a host
will purposely say some dickie things

1133
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:49,880
about you thinking they're going to chop
down your set.

1134
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,920
I've done the same thing.
I just go after him.

1135
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,770
Upset.
Totally.

1136
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:54,830
Yeah.
Um,

1137
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,940
who's in brendan schaub told me the
stories like he to people because,

1138
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:04,680
you know,
he's a big guy and a stand up new

1139
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,330
standards and somebody went up on stage
at the improv and he said,

1140
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,720
um,
he said,

1141
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,030
who the fuck is that guy?
Like,

1142
00:53:11,031 --> 00:53:15,870
you can't be that handsome fucking
started just tearing into them for being

1143
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:19,160
like,
this isn't a fighter too for you.

1144
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,200
Yeah.
Well those erik griffin was it?

1145
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,910
Yeah,
he was just fucking around.

1146
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,230
Yeah,
it was just like,

1147
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,680
that's what you say,
you know,

1148
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:25,980
the guy

1149
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,730
goes up and he does stand up and he's
got this perfect haircut and you're

1150
00:53:29,731 --> 00:53:29,941
like,
hey,

1151
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:30,990
fuck you.
You know,

1152
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:35,991
eric goes up with the spare tire rod is
waste is a big jolly guy fuck out of

1153
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:40,980
here with this fatty with glasses and a
mustache mustache.

1154
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:46,050
So he looks like he puts on the glasses
and mustache together today.

1155
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,030
It's like when he was doing that,
I was trying to tell brendan,

1156
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:51,481
I go,
dude,

1157
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:52,890
that's what we do.
I go,

1158
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:54,570
you got to understand that like you go
up,

1159
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:56,640
you do your set,
the guys can shit on you.

1160
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,280
You know what I mean?
That's like I would have shit on youtube

1161
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,050
probably.
Especially in New York,

1162
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:01,950
same thing.
Oh,

1163
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:06,600
you fucking whore in New York anymore.
If you don't do two or three minutes of

1164
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:09,930
what's going on in the room and what
just happened,

1165
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:12,480
you're going to have his shitty set like
that's I would.

1166
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,190
That's what I learned right away.
You have to Be like,

1167
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,320
you know,
start of hugging,

1168
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:21,270
hold everyone's attention and just start
launching into material to comment on

1169
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:23,700
what's happening.
You know what that is from.

1170
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,560
I noticed that too when I lived in New
York,

1171
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:28,620
I was like this because the crowds are
small and the stage is small.

1172
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,470
It's way more intimate experience.
It's like the belly room,

1173
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,050
you know?
The belly room is a totally different

1174
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:36,510
experience in the or,
which is a totally different experience

1175
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:39,000
in the main room.
It's one of the beautiful things about

1176
00:54:39,001 --> 00:54:41,760
doing the hat trick of the comedy store.
if you do all three rooms in a night,

1177
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:45,360
you get to feel the different.
Like the belly room is so much more

1178
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:48,480
intimate and so much more intense
because there's only 70 people in the

1179
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:51,700
room and they're jammed in there and
they're right in front of you.

1180
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,530
And that's like in New York room.
so I'm doing that.

1181
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,840
That show on showtime about standup
comedy.

1182
00:54:57,841 --> 00:55:00,570
I'm dying up here.
You get to meet that guy in the back.

1183
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,930
That's helping me.
He's making that show.

1184
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:08,070
And we were talking about the belly room
and interviewing people about that just

1185
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,510
to figure it out.
And that used to be,

1186
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,270
it was called a billy room because it
was for women.

1187
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,660
And then like at pregnant women,
you know,

1188
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:19,290
like a womb.
Mitsui literally thought of it as a

1189
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,300
comedy womb.
Yep.

1190
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,340
Yeah.
And then they used to put overflow.

1191
00:55:23,341 --> 00:55:26,220
So if richard pryor,
somebody huge was in the main room,

1192
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,200
they put all the overflow up in the
belly room and then a comic would be on

1193
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,450
stage and they'd come in if like a table
opened up,

1194
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,480
they'd go mid,
mid act thompson party for like you,

1195
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,460
you're doing stand up onstage.

1196
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,160
And the waItress would come in and go at
the thompson's here and then the

1197
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:46,980
thompson's ever sitting in the front and
they just get up and walk out and go to

1198
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:50,430
see richard pryor
so that place,

1199
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:52,620
you know.
And then I worked on that with erik

1200
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:57,621
griffin so I didn't really know him that
well before and hilarious just fucking

1201
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:02,750
fucks with people nonstop.
so of course he was the guy that said

1202
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,590
that shit,
but he's a great dude.

1203
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,660
He's a nice guy.
He's not doing it because he's an

1204
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:07,830
asshole.
He's just being silly.

1205
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:08,990
That's what I was trying to tell
brendan.

1206
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,710
He's like,
you wouldn't hit me hard bro.

1207
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,750
And I'm like,
that's what we do.

1208
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,270
You like brendan's new to this whole
world,

1209
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,340
you know,
because he started out doing podcasts.

1210
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:20,220
He's a funnY guy.
And then he started doing these live

1211
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:25,060
podcasts with cal and then they would do
sort of like a little sketch,

1212
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,950
like a comedy routine.

1213
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:31,290
and then he would do a few minutes on
his own just doing like kind of standup,

1214
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,890
like telling his story.
And he's funny.

1215
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:37,180
He says he has some funny ideas.
So now he's doing sets like on a regular

1216
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:41,380
basis and then he's doing sets in front
of people don't know which is the right

1217
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:42,340
way to do it.
Totally.

1218
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:45,850
The bad things that people do is they
only do their own crowd over and over

1219
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:47,770
and over again.
Not smart.

1220
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,400
You got to go out and do those shows
that I was trying to.

1221
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:52,540
Like when you start doing standup
comedy,

1222
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,740
you invite all your friends out and it
takes you three sets to figure out,

1223
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:59,250
oh shit,
I better stop inviting my friends that

1224
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,710
do it.
Well and not only that,

1225
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,870
but if you invite your friends out and
they're a significant part of the

1226
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:06,220
audience,
they've already seen your jokes.

1227
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,001
Yeah,
exactly.

1228
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:09,370
It's just goes bad right away and you're
like,

1229
00:57:09,371 --> 00:57:10,540
oh,
I want to make strangers laugh.

1230
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:14,560
I want to make a complete strangers like
and if I can do that and it just makes

1231
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:17,080
you a better comic.
I got a bunch of shit and we were

1232
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:19,510
talking about this building.
I got a bunch of shit for fucking

1233
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:22,130
heckling.
Steevo an attitude,

1234
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:23,850
heckle them in the audience,
the improv.

1235
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:25,750
I was on stage,
I told the story,

1236
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:27,520
I said,
I don't again,

1237
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,640
I don't want to be this guy.
I really don't.

1238
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,520
You don't understand that it is a
problem and I'm trying to.

1239
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:36,250
I'm going to go to a cognitive
behavioral.

1240
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:39,640
This what the doctor prescribed me is
cognitive behavioral specialists is

1241
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:41,990
gonna stop me from doing shit like this.
ReallY?

1242
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,450
Yeah.
But,

1243
00:57:43,451 --> 00:57:44,650
uh,
I said,

1244
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,750
uh,
I don't feel bad,

1245
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,584
that bad event,
this.

1246
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,730
I said,
um,

1247
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,510
he was in the audience and I said,
alriGht,

1248
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,790
I go,
I don't want to care about standup this

1249
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:55,090
much.

1250
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,130
I really don't.
I'm so passionate about this.

1251
00:57:57,131 --> 00:58:01,300
you guys don't fucking understand.
Like I take so and so stole this joke

1252
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:05,410
and stole that joke and I go,
I just got to come to grips with the

1253
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:09,370
fact that what I feel like is my life's
calling is somebody else's last resort.

1254
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:13,180
And then,
because I told you about like dustin

1255
00:58:13,181 --> 00:58:15,250
diamond to stand up,
I go fucking,

1256
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:16,250
uh,
you know,

1257
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,470
skippy from family times does stand up
like,

1258
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,400
and then people don't even know what
that is anymore.

1259
00:58:21,401 --> 00:58:22,870
I know.
Does he still do it?

1260
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,190
Skippy?
Yeah,

1261
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,910
I think so.
That's the diamond was in jail and stab

1262
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:28,744
somebody.
Yeah.

1263
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,220
Yeah,
tell he was doing stand up.

1264
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:36,670
He was lIke a family ties sort of ended.
He was doing standup when I was an open

1265
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:42,460
mic or I was just starting out and he
was headlining in these places and

1266
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:43,061
that's,
you know,

1267
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,210
he had this big smile,
skippy from family ties and he just

1268
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:50,200
would go on the road,
but I never heard from him again.

1269
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,240
Yeah,
I wonder what that guy's doing.

1270
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:56,020
There's kind of at some point the
audience just goes away and then people

1271
00:58:56,021 --> 00:58:58,090
stopped booking you and then you have to
go away.

1272
00:58:58,091 --> 00:59:00,340
I guess.
What do you do a job?

1273
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,650
I guess?
Hopefully you invested your money

1274
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:05,400
properly and some real estate.
Skippy.

1275
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:10,780
Skippy is just a real estate baron Who
talks me down and has callen has talked

1276
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:12,310
me down a couple of tImes.
He's like,

1277
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:13,240
no,
just relax.

1278
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:15,550
He's a nice guy.
Don't worry about it counts as a calm

1279
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:16,300
guy.
Yeah.

1280
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,340
But you know,
the thing is like it is your life

1281
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:20,830
calling and for some people it isn't.
Some people,

1282
00:59:20,831 --> 00:59:23,720
it's like something that came along
after they had been doing a bunch of

1283
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:25,820
other stuff,
but that's okay.

1284
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,713
Yeah,
whatever.

1285
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:29,780
Who cares?
There's an audience for a lot of people

1286
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:31,280
will say like,
that guy's not really comic.

1287
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:35,900
Like if you're doing stand up your comic
and although most of them don't ever

1288
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:37,730
become comics,
you respect.

1289
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,760
It's not like it's outside the realm of
possibility that you could do it or I

1290
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:42,380
could do it.
How come they can't do it?

1291
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:46,490
Somebody said this about carrot top,
like that fucker carried around say what

1292
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:48,590
you will.
But that fucking carried around that bag

1293
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,380
fucking time.
Not only that,

1294
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,020
he,
he monopolize that genre.

1295
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,150
That was a legit genre.
When we started out.

1296
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,490
You remember like there were prop
comics.

1297
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,470
I'm buddies with rusty.

1298
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,890
Rusty do.
It was a problem.

1299
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,110
Yeah,
but there's no prop comics anymore.

1300
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:08,330
that's and carrot top.
He killed the genre.

1301
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,261
Wow.
Dude.

1302
01:00:09,261 --> 01:00:11,730
When I first started in 88,
there was a.

1303
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:15,320
you would have a prop comic on every
other show.

1304
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,290
Three or four shows.
You do three or four shows.

1305
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:22,070
One of those shows.
How would have a prop comic con it now?

1306
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:24,620
They don't exist anymore,
so I really feel like in this.

1307
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,830
I'm dying up here.
We did a good job of bringing all that

1308
01:00:27,831 --> 01:00:30,080
stuff back and this is nice.
Set.

1309
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:33,320
Nineteen,
73 weekend on a ventriloquist is.

1310
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,520
I can't Wait for you to see the show.
The other thing,

1311
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:36,800
there's no more.
Ventral goes.

1312
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:39,920
Who killed that?
I'm probably dual.

1313
01:00:39,921 --> 01:00:41,340
Jeff dunham.
Yes.

1314
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,130
He owns it.
He owns it.

1315
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,490
He owns it.
And then there was.

1316
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:49,150
You saw otto and george.
I worked with auto times many times.

1317
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,690
We did prom shows together in New York.
Oh my god.

1318
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,100
Tell me.
People don't know what auto in Georgia,

1319
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,880
so you can.
Maybe you can explain it as you worked

1320
01:00:55,881 --> 01:00:59,810
with them because I saw the puppet would
say the most vicious,

1321
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,200
vile,
racist shit and then he would go,

1322
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,060
I can't believe you're saying that.
And you'd go,

1323
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,170
hey,
look at that fucking ladies.

1324
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,690
Yeah.
It was just walking the entire room.

1325
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,690
He would say ruthless,
ruthless shit.

1326
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,580
He was a great guy to dead.
Yeah.

1327
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,010
He died and I'm a sawyer.
Had them in that small room and we

1328
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:26,870
watched tourist after tours walkaway and
tom looked at me and the rest of the

1329
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:29,660
comics who again,
or just hunched over on the floor and he

1330
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:32,240
goes,
I'm losing money this weekend guys,

1331
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:35,600
but this is for us.
That's great.

1332
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:38,090
yeah,
and his act was ridiculous.

1333
01:01:38,091 --> 01:01:41,010
We did a.
We did jersey shore shows for this guy.

1334
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:43,040
Pop gonzo.
We did a.

1335
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:47,210
I did a lot of shows with auto.
They go looking for horse and crack.

1336
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:47,900
Oh,
he would go.

1337
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,040
He would go off.
Yeah,

1338
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:51,110
he would get crazy here.
We get crazy.

1339
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,120
You have through sending.
So we ended up with ventriloquist in the

1340
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:57,350
show.
Kind of like the petty fights.

1341
01:01:57,351 --> 01:02:00,620
Like I get to write on it,
so I got to incorporate all my fucking

1342
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:04,310
weirdness in there and like a petty
bullshit.

1343
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,900
Bad intro.
Fuck you.

1344
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:11,780
Well you guys also got 19 seventies
wardrobe and hair,

1345
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,060
which is fucking bad ass.
I saw some photos of it.

1346
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,240
my daughter walked out to me and I'm
onset.

1347
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:20,310
Didn't say anything about my hair.
I'm not going to biggest mustache you.

1348
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:21,910
I'll post a picture of just dragging
them.

1349
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,280
I think it's on,
it's online.

1350
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,420
Jamie could probably find it.
Um,

1351
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:29,700
huge real mustache.
Big side burns and that our mind.

1352
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:31,920
And then this wig,
my daughter walks up,

1353
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,500
she goes,
why are you wearing a towel?

1354
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:36,583
Terry?
Cloth

1355
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,080
towels.
They bother.

1356
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:44,050
Why is your shirt made out of a towel?
I don't understand.

1357
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,810
As kids growing up,
how were your kids who had grown up with

1358
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:52,650
like do they know stand up comic debt?
Like they're figuring it out?

1359
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,050
Yeah.
I brought my uh,

1360
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:58,830
living in New York,
brought practicing for a comedy central

1361
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:03,831
special that I don't think one person
saw and I go an hour half hour.

1362
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,710
When did you do it?
I did in 2014.

1363
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:09,420
Two thousand 13 or something that gave
you,

1364
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:13,050
once you started doing the daily show,
early show special came out and how many

1365
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:16,740
times they were having crying.
Just fuckIng midnight on a friday.

1366
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:19,260
Those motherfuckers you burn a special
with them.

1367
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:21,180
Yeah,
it's a problem.

1368
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:22,440
Well,
you know what?

1369
01:03:22,441 --> 01:03:24,540
And then they're like,
but you can catch It online at comedy

1370
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,130
central.
Dr. But he companies going there,

1371
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,860
no one is going there,
it's not happening to them to do,

1372
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:32,970
to netflix,
sell them to netflix or have a

1373
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:35,130
billboard,
really have a campaIgn that says dave

1374
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:37,230
attell,
jim gaffigan,

1375
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,010
jill rogue,
like all these names of just every comic

1376
01:03:41,011 --> 01:03:43,650
that you love and watch all available
here.

1377
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,260
Two dollars.
Like,

1378
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:46,740
you know,
what are some like just not going to do

1379
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:47,880
that because no one's going to do it.

1380
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,750
They're not like you have to have
something on a platform that people are

1381
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:52,080
already used to.
Cecil,

1382
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,870
you have amazon,
you have netflix and you know,

1383
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,300
like apple,
that's it.

1384
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,030
No one else is going anywhere else.
It's just not going to happen.

1385
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:01,710
Yeah.
It's too easy to do those things.

1386
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,200
So anyway,
to be burned that special.

1387
01:04:04,201 --> 01:04:04,801
Anyway.
So,

1388
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:06,750
uh,
I am practicing for that.

1389
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,270
I go up to rochester,
New York,

1390
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:14,730
bring my wife and kids with me and we
stay in a holiday inn and suites and

1391
01:04:15,781 --> 01:04:18,720
this is a six year old little girl,
goes over to the curtains,

1392
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:19,980
opens them up,
and she goes,

1393
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,710
I'm,
why am I looking at the parking lot?

1394
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,300
I go,
everybody gather around.

1395
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,690
ThIs is the road.
Okay,

1396
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:31,740
that's what I do.
This is what daddy does,

1397
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:35,190
so when you think I'm having a great
time flying around,

1398
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:38,160
it really gets sad.
We're going to fight a businessman for a

1399
01:04:38,161 --> 01:04:41,850
waffle tomorrow morning.
Everybody shut up

1400
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,410
those rochester road gigs.
Rough like those spots where people

1401
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,420
don't necessarily want to go.
Albany.

1402
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,880
Rochester,
well yeah.

1403
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:55,881
It was a bar.
It is attached to a country western bar

1404
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:58,200
called daisy dukes.
Oh,

1405
01:04:58,201 --> 01:05:03,201
jesus looked that up.
It a place in in youngstown,

1406
01:05:03,451 --> 01:05:08,010
Ohio that I did that was a to a disco
and there was a back door and every time

1407
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:10,230
the back door would open up,
like when people would go to the

1408
01:05:10,231 --> 01:05:15,231
bathroom here
and the door would slowly close.

1409
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,500
Okay.
So it was rough.

1410
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,260
I did this place,
laughs in kirkland,

1411
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,910
Washington,
Washington,

1412
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,230
and I go there and I'm doing this again
if you want.

1413
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:34,120
She's like longer stories,
tangents,

1414
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:35,530
characters,
shit like that.

1415
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:40,531
For the most part,
like my closer is 25 minutes long and

1416
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,400
this special.
It starts wIth this 2014.

1417
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,310
No,
this is the one I'm doing right now that

1418
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:47,350
comes down to,
thIs comes out this week and 20 minutes

1419
01:05:47,351 --> 01:05:49,810
long,
so it's this big long fucking bit that

1420
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:52,900
I've been working on forever about
revenge and my anger.

1421
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,740
I did see food revenge.
I shrimped the place.

1422
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:58,030
That's what it's called.
Shrimp in an easy.

1423
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:03,630
So I'm a fucking.
Just a mess and I'm.

1424
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,720
Well I forgot I just got off track.
I forgot what I was talking about.

1425
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:12,060
The road open up the parking lot,
fighting someone over a waterfall.

1426
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,630
Kirkland,
Washington so,

1427
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:17,980
so at kirkland hand a big long in the
middle of a big long story and they

1428
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:22,150
bring out these trays that have neon
lights around them with jello shots on

1429
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:27,151
him and they and they and everybody in
the entire audience looks at these trays

1430
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:29,350
there.
They look like ufo was.

1431
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:32,830
They got jello shots on him and I go,
ladies and gentlemen,

1432
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:37,300
we're going to interrupt.
Is a crafted a bit that took me fIve

1433
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,370
years to master to bring you in.

1434
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:40,773
Yeah.

1435
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,140
Who wants a jello shot?
Lets everybody do jello shots.

1436
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:46,210
Ladies and gentlemen.
Jello shot time.

1437
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:49,630
and I just started fucking selling the
shit out of jello shots as a bit because

1438
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:52,420
I'm like,
this guy fucked up like this.

1439
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:55,080
I need everyone concentrating.
Ideal is printing it out.

1440
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,010
The owner and the waitresses are
bringing out these trays.

1441
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:03,130
Just ufo trays.
The jello shots at a comedy club at a

1442
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,960
comedy club.
Lose every single person in the

1443
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:06,220
audience.
It's A standard thing.

1444
01:07:06,221 --> 01:07:07,001
They do,
I guess.

1445
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:10,660
So I just went with it and what they do
at the end of the night to wrap up,

1446
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,140
there's just a big push in the night.
We're going to get some extra dollars in

1447
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,270
our coffers.
Believe it was happening.

1448
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:19,810
I was shocked at the time and then the
owner comes up like I was serious.

1449
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:21,280
And he goes,
holy shit.

1450
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,950
He goes,
we sold out of jello shots.

1451
01:07:23,951 --> 01:07:25,930
You were amazing.
That was unbelievable.

1452
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,740
And then I walk into the next night
who's got more jello shots?

1453
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:33,550
I mean the kitchen is filled with them
and those jello shots come out.

1454
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,880
And I don't say a thing.

1455
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,640
Siri.
I thought we were a business together.

1456
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:45,670
We had a good thing going on.
I don't know if you know this because he

1457
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:47,440
didn't mention he didn't mention the
jello shots.

1458
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:49,330
What are you doing?
I go,

1459
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,620
yeah,
I really,

1460
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:54,880
I don't know if you could tell by really
hate the fucking jello shots like I go.

1461
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,280
It was just,
it was horrible.

1462
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,780
You should not be selling them.
I don't know.

1463
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,400
It's a huge distraction.
What did he say?

1464
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:06,100
It was just to teach you a lesson.
Like a fucking sell any jello shots now.

1465
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:07,210
You weren't pushing them?
No.

1466
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,080
Zero.
No.

1467
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,070
so he just had a huge,
like he should probably explained that

1468
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:13,110
to him.
Yeah,

1469
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:14,950
on the first night and then he would
have got it,

1470
01:08:14,951 --> 01:08:16,250
but he probably still would have sold
them anyway.

1471
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:19,750
He made money and he was a nice guy and
it was nice,

1472
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,080
like it was just like it.

1473
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:23,600
I don't know man,
like I can't.

1474
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,260
It's hard for me to do.
And again,

1475
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,890
if you have people coming out that know
you and you're going out to see

1476
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:35,891
something in you like collectively or
group of people that love an individual

1477
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:38,420
comic,
it's a great place to be.

1478
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,780
But again,
if you're up there winning over 60

1479
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:44,980
percent of the audience,
not good,

1480
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,220
but rather just go hang out at the
store.

1481
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,820
Well,
it's good to do the road though because

1482
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:52,790
like you can.
I think like every time you do a set in

1483
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:55,130
a new place,
you got a new experience,

1484
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,660
a new vibe,
a new feel,

1485
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,480
new crowds.
New I like.

1486
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,370
I think places also have like a
different personality.

1487
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,840
Like I feel like portland,
Oregon has a different personality than

1488
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,090
a lot of places.
Like you go up to portland and feels

1489
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:10,310
different,
the audience feels different and then

1490
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:13,340
you go to austin,
Texas different feeling like a little

1491
01:09:13,341 --> 01:09:13,730
lighter.

1492
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:16,010
They're little lighter,
a little more fun.

1493
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:18,710
It's more silly.
I like doing shows in Canada,

1494
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,920
in toronto.
One of the best sets I've ever had my

1495
01:09:21,921 --> 01:09:23,210
entire fucking life.
Toronto,

1496
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:27,440
vancouver is fun for me to go to.
Canadians are just great audiences.

1497
01:09:27,441 --> 01:09:29,420
I don't know what it is to just.
It's loose.

1498
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,830
They're not uptight about 20 percent
less douchebags.

1499
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:33,830
Really?
Yeah.

1500
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:36,760
That's my theory about Canada.
They have 20 percent less douche bags

1501
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,740
and it must be what it is.
There's aLways fun.

1502
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:42,110
Yeah,
but they have 20 percent less as in that

1503
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:45,780
vancouver.
A calculated metrics of comedy mix.

1504
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:46,614
Yeah.
Great spot.

1505
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,160
Awesome spot.
And you go right to your hotel.

1506
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:50,210
You go,
it's in the hotel.

1507
01:09:50,211 --> 01:09:52,400
If you go down,
down to the bottom floor,

1508
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,840
walk right into the club.
All clubs,

1509
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:56,080
underground comedy works,
dcm,

1510
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:58,580
prive.
If you live at a bad old copies that we

1511
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:01,100
talked about.
All these great places.

1512
01:10:01,101 --> 01:10:03,500
Yep.
I'll just underground comedy club,

1513
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:05,090
but there's something about it.
It's just fun.

1514
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:06,500
Anyway,
so,

1515
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:09,290
um,
I think there's three guys in the front

1516
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:13,420
row and I look at them and they keep
going on in the bathroom,

1517
01:10:13,421 --> 01:10:18,421
like you just do coca and we
look at the bounce around.

1518
01:10:19,211 --> 01:10:21,380
I like these guys are clearly doing
coke.

1519
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,490
No one you shot him in the front row and
then because.

1520
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:29,270
Well they paid to sit in the front row.
That's a koch money.

1521
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:33,110
Well,
vancouver is a big coke town.

1522
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:33,891
Really?
Yeah.

1523
01:10:33,891 --> 01:10:36,200
It's a big weed town,
but it's aLso a big coke town.

1524
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,093
They,
um,

1525
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,810
I was one of the points where I had
sunday night after that said,

1526
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,550
and I go after that weekend,
it's the last sentence.

1527
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:48,080
I'm hanging out with this great comic up
there,

1528
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:52,370
graeme clark and Bearded guy looks like
de young santa claus,

1529
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,540
like all,
you know,

1530
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:58,040
vancouver coMics and we go and we're
having drinks at a bar and you're buying

1531
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:03,820
and these two girls send over these two
shots of Jack Daniels and um,

1532
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:12,070
he's not attractive fella.
I'm no brenton job and so we go run yet

1533
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,140
really?
Or they look over our shoulders.

1534
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,040
This for us.
Okay.

1535
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,240
It must've been at the show.
That's it must've been to jump.

1536
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:23,000
They weren't at the show.
We're,

1537
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,990
there's a lot of chicks in that town.

1538
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:26,610
Maybe they wanted you to liver.
Yeah,

1539
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:29,340
that's what I was thinking,
that I immediately go to fucking me in

1540
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:31,010
the bathtub.
no,

1541
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,360
oregon's wake up on you.
Totally.

1542
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,590
I'm very suspicious because rocking her
wedding ring.

1543
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:41,310
exactly.
Not people's sexiest man alive,

1544
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,450
you know.
So I can,

1545
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,910
my wife is very attractive,
but

1546
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,640
I'm not pulling any chicks after shows.
And um,

1547
01:11:49,641 --> 01:11:49,940
the,
um,

1548
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:50,773
no,
uh,

1549
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,900
you know,
Brian Collins,

1550
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:53,700
outgoing,
nice guy,

1551
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:55,740
I'm not brian.
So why is this,

1552
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:59,760
why they I know.
So then they come over and this is,

1553
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:04,790
I've never felt so bad about these two
chicks are hot and I immediately go to,

1554
01:12:06,631 --> 01:12:09,090
we're going to die,
like they're trying to drag us and take

1555
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,670
some shit.
And Then,

1556
01:12:10,671 --> 01:12:12,480
uh,
because I can't under offer any

1557
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:16,170
explanation for it and now they're
congram and so we send them back shots

1558
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,460
and we don't go over there.

1559
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,271
We just like,
okay,

1560
01:12:18,271 --> 01:12:21,660
it's even now.
And then they come join us at a taBle

1561
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,290
and then the one girl starts talking to
us.

1562
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:25,350
We were like,
were you guys the show?

1563
01:12:25,351 --> 01:12:25,951
And they're like,
what?

1564
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:29,320
Show?
And then I go onto we're chitchatting

1565
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,840
and the one girl goes,
she goes,

1566
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:32,640
I really want to go to strip clubs right
now.

1567
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,031
And I said,
fuck,

1568
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:37,970
in this second trucking fantasy for me,
it's,

1569
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:41,600
if I can go to strip clubs with these
hot chicks and uh,

1570
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,040
and graham looks at me and I go,
well,

1571
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:48,960
I could a flight to catch.
And I guess I'll just see you guys

1572
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:53,961
later.
Fucking walked awaY and that's never had

1573
01:12:54,241 --> 01:12:58,830
this happened in vancouver.
You walk around that cIty and I was just

1574
01:12:58,831 --> 01:13:01,740
placed called the cactus club.
And have you been there?

1575
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,210
No.
Oh my god.

1576
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,880
What is it?
They cast with head shots.

1577
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:08,340
They uh,
they staff their whole place with head

1578
01:13:08,341 --> 01:13:09,180
shots.
Real.

1579
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:11,760
It's the most gorgeous women you've ever
seen in your entire life.

1580
01:13:11,761 --> 01:13:13,890
working at a place.
Cactus club.

1581
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:17,610
That cactus the cactus club.
I don't know where they came back.

1582
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:20,580
So the uh,
they uh,

1583
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:24,130
it's a lot of just hot chicks and that's
when I saw in vancouver was just

1584
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:29,160
drinking hot chicks.
I think prostitution is legal road.

1585
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:32,880
Do you think there are prostitutes?
They might've been prostitutes.

1586
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:38,230
They got your drinks thinking they'll
get these guys intoxicated.

1587
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,750
Look at him.
He's got glasses on executive or

1588
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,960
something,
some more money.

1589
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,250
He's got a little whore stash.
Beacon ors.

1590
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:51,480
I just went to the beverly wilshire
hotel.

1591
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,820
Where's that?
I did a private gig.

1592
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:57,390
It's on right at the end of rodeo drive
in Beverly hills.

1593
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:02,520
And then it's on wilshire and hits and
it's an old hotel and Me and tom papa

1594
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:07,521
did a charity gig on monday night,
so then me and tom hit the bar

1595
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:12,280
afterwards and proceed to watch parade

1596
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:17,610
of high end or go through that place
picking off old men left and right to

1597
01:14:18,101 --> 01:14:20,960
the point where we're like,
we were just shocked that he was really

1598
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:22,870
amazing.
Good looking ladies.

1599
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,680
Well there's that.
There's that crazy beverly hills money.

1600
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:28,450
You know,
just the other day I was looking at real

1601
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:31,780
estate in beverly hills for a goof.
You ever looked at like the redfin app

1602
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,830
though?
I love that.

1603
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,150
I love to do that.
every now and then.

1604
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,000
If I was going to move to beverly hills,
let's see what I can afford.

1605
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:42,030
I'm looking at
like $17,000,000 house to $85 million.

1606
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,360
A hundred million to $100 million.
Duke,

1607
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,750
who's.
That's exactly who's buying it.

1608
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:53,440
Well,
I went to dinner with my wife and one of

1609
01:14:53,441 --> 01:14:54,580
her friends,
her friend's husband,

1610
01:14:54,581 --> 01:14:59,581
and we went in beverly hills and this
guy pulled up in a million dollar car.

1611
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:01,750
He had a bugatti Iran.

1612
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,220
It's a million dollar car and it has
saudi arabian license plates on plated,

1613
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,010
which is totally illegal.
It's totally illegal to have Saudi

1614
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:11,830
Arabia license plates,
like they're taking these cars.

1615
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:14,560
They either fly him over or they put
them on a boat.

1616
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:16,870
They have them registered and Saudi
Arabia,

1617
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:20,290
they bring them to America and they
drive around with these plates on it.

1618
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:25,150
That palace plates,
like it said like palace on the fucking

1619
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:29,500
plate and those guys warren taken
carries because there's so much money.

1620
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:32,020
Yeah.
You remember that one guy that was like

1621
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:37,050
some sort of a foreign dignitary guy and
he was banging his maids or force them

1622
01:15:37,481 --> 01:15:40,360
to suck his dick or something like that.
And they called the cops on him and they

1623
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:43,500
aRrested him and then you know,
they were going to process them and

1624
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,110
charge him with rape and he just fucking
hopped in a private jet and flew out of

1625
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:49,810
the country and they were saying,
why did you let this guy go?

1626
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:50,591
Oh,
fuck You.

1627
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:52,780
Fuck you.
Diplomatic community.

1628
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,280
He was crying.
Diplomatic immunity.

1629
01:15:54,281 --> 01:15:55,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

1630
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:59,790
But I'm juSt thinking about my mate is
this old fucking mexican lady for

1631
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:03,700
sinners.
The money it was arnold,

1632
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:08,230
but he did get the money in that area
and beverly hills area is just,

1633
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:11,500
it's catastrophic.
I mean it's stratospheric rather it's

1634
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:13,900
off the charts.
like you can't even understand.

1635
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:17,020
like the guy who makes good money is
poor there.

1636
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,700
Your I'm a poor person there.
Yeah,

1637
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,020
I do well,
but I'm poor.

1638
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:23,470
There sure is.
When you get into oil money,

1639
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:28,950
people who own money and even in the
United States,

1640
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:32,320
we do have people that have been here
for so long and generate,

1641
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:36,670
you know trump's ma mayflower fucking
shit where it's like,

1642
01:16:36,671 --> 01:16:37,690
oh yeah,
we own.

1643
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,790
We used to have my family used to own
pasadena.

1644
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:45,460
That's another tricky thing is say we've
talked about that is where there was so

1645
01:16:45,461 --> 01:16:50,461
much money in pasedena that they put
that to 10 freeway there.

1646
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:54,370
That's white is where it is.
So they keep the black people on the

1647
01:16:54,371 --> 01:16:55,570
other side.
What's.

1648
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:59,200
That's exactly what every ways there
where they keep the black people on

1649
01:16:59,201 --> 01:17:00,370
which side?
On the other side.

1650
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:05,390
Now north of pasadena,
that to 10 separates out to dina.

1651
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,960
That's where the black people are.
That's where the black people,

1652
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,770
that's why they call it crime medina.

1653
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,190
Really?
They called altadena crime medina.

1654
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,100
No way.
Yeah,

1655
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:14,540
that's rough up there.
Yeah.

1656
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:19,070
We were playing weird playing this youth
basketball league when my son was maybe

1657
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:23,120
like a fifth grader and that got the
nicest man in the world who ran a

1658
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:25,250
basketball league.
Just got hit by a bullet in the head and

1659
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:26,580
fucking dead.
Yeah,

1660
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:29,330
pasadena streets.
There was this park.

1661
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,450
He got shot in pasedena.
Just stray bullet.

1662
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,340
A stray bullet.
Yeah.

1663
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:37,370
Who they shooting at each other?
You know,

1664
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,600
gangs.
Whoa.

1665
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,800
In pasadena,
there's gang violence in pasadena.

1666
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,540
Shit load of it.
What are the ice house?

1667
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,360
Not near the ice house.
Ice houses on the right side.

1668
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,760
A south side.
This is the freeway.

1669
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:55,430
Go fucking north of that freeway and go
up into the hills right there and

1670
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:57,530
there's a shitload of crime.
Shitload.

1671
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,230
Wow.
I saw there's this place called villa

1672
01:18:00,231 --> 01:18:05,120
park where my son was playing soccer and
we went there and I saw guys getting

1673
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:08,060
their haircut in the street,
like a stock guy sit down and just

1674
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:12,110
buzzing and lines of people just giving
haircuts in the street and everybody

1675
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:15,080
watch out like this fucking rough
neighborhood.

1676
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,810
We're just dudes getting haircuts in the
street and you're like,

1677
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:20,480
fucking everybody look alive.
It's rough.

1678
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:21,710
It's a lot of latinos,
you know.

1679
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:25,640
And there's also a lot of um,
black on mexican crime member when that

1680
01:18:25,641 --> 01:18:30,050
was happening in the nla,
the mexican guys were just shooting

1681
01:18:30,051 --> 01:18:33,170
black people,
not black people really read any of

1682
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:33,860
them.
Yep.

1683
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,810
Why trying to run them out of
neighborhoods.

1684
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:36,920
Whoa.
Yep.

1685
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:41,210
When you get into like ms 13 shit.
Yeah.

1686
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,400
Convinced it starts to get.
Well,

1687
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:47,480
that's where like Gary White people get
really pro trump,

1688
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,823
you know,
they're,

1689
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:51,930
they get very excited about trump and
that's ms.

1690
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:54,560
[inaudible] is one of the things that
they keep bringing it up and all these

1691
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,860
illegal immigrants that have these gangs
for the most part.

1692
01:18:57,861 --> 01:19:02,000
When you look at all of the people
coming in to work,

1693
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,590
they don't want any trouble shore.
Nobody.

1694
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,940
Everybody wants to keep their head down
work these so I can give themselves a

1695
01:19:10,941 --> 01:19:11,690
chance.

1696
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:14,450
Road,
trouble it with anything.

1697
01:19:14,451 --> 01:19:17,270
There's going to be bad apples.
There's going to be the guy in san

1698
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:20,860
francisco that everybody keeps referring
to kind of be gangs,

1699
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:23,600
but you know what?
I see that everYwhere I go,

1700
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:29,110
that is a huge fucking problem that is
going to just spreading like wildfire is

1701
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,370
fucking math.
Yeah.

1702
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:32,383
Math.
Oh,

1703
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:35,300
thInk when you go an adderall,
by the way.

1704
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,530
Adderalls ben.
Oh,

1705
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:38,570
it's a huge problem and it leads people
to meth.

1706
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:39,620
Really?
Oh yeah,

1707
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,500
for sure.
Adderall and meth are closely related.

1708
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,380
Very closely related.
If they're both amphetamines.

1709
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:48,740
I took a half adderall once and I was
like,

1710
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:50,960
oh,
I'm never doing that again.

1711
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,550
Fuck yeah,
I do.

1712
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,840
I'm not too good on drugs.
It's a.

1713
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,530
I took.
Freddy soto gave me an ambien who was an

1714
01:20:00,531 --> 01:20:02,620
ambien,
unfortunately to the men,

1715
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,900
wasn't it?
It had to be sleep apnea.

1716
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:08,100
That yeah,
he's fat and sIck,

1717
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,060
you know,
drugs

1718
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:11,740
and sleep apnea.
Parents,

1719
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:14,130
a lethal combination because you don't
feel yourself choking.

1720
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:17,270
Yeah,
he gave me an ambien.

1721
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:19,230
I,
we moved.

1722
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:24,450
I took it as like I needed to take a nap
and that was all wound up.

1723
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,020
I slept for five hours straight in the
middle of the day and I was like,

1724
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:30,750
I'm never fucking taken that again.
And then,

1725
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:34,260
um,
took this adderall and just felt all

1726
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:37,850
fucked up and just never.
I'm like,

1727
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,950
I don't think my body don't know,
just,

1728
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:42,210
uh,
I don't do anything.

1729
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:46,680
I was getting really tired during the
day and I remember you told me to take

1730
01:20:46,681 --> 01:20:51,630
some vitamin d and so we started taking
a multivitamin and that really helps me

1731
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:53,910
and I take a lot of b 12.
That helps.

1732
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:57,840
And it would also help you in a big way,
cut out all the bread and sugar and

1733
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:01,500
carbs and all that stuff because then
the insulin spikes,

1734
01:21:01,501 --> 01:21:04,600
you're not getting these big spikes,
which is a big reason why people crash

1735
01:21:04,601 --> 01:21:05,434
the other day.

1736
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:07,200
It's bread,
bread,

1737
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,850
pasta,
all that stuff.

1738
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,720
Like your body goes too far and your
body has to process that and you get

1739
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:15,330
this big slump is soon as you cut all
that out.

1740
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,900
You experience a much,
even much more even flow of energy

1741
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:19,790
through the day.
Yeah.

1742
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:24,360
So if I could just learn to um,
do like that.

1743
01:21:24,361 --> 01:21:26,400
Like I'm like,
I'm again,

1744
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:31,520
I'm such a glutton man.
A bread when the kids were,

1745
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,540
my wife has making,
gives you a fresh loaves of this artist

1746
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:39,690
and bread that she has.
Then steve may bring peanut butter and

1747
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:42,450
jelly and it seems like I just like a
scavenger.

1748
01:21:42,451 --> 01:21:44,540
I'm a family goat.
Like I'll just cross

1749
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:50,160
out all the kids leave behind.
Sometimes it's stuff dealing with

1750
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,900
ordering food for myself at a restaurant
because I know that everyone's going to

1751
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:58,620
leave half their shit or all order
myself a full entree and then somebody

1752
01:21:58,621 --> 01:22:01,950
will have half a chicken parmigiana or
something over on it because my son and

1753
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,830
daughter and system ordering off the
kid's menu.

1754
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:07,770
And so now I got somebody eating a full
chicken parmesan,

1755
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:10,560
but they'll only eat half of it and I'm
not going to let that go to waste.

1756
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:13,620
And so I'll start digging into that and
then there's pasta.

1757
01:22:13,621 --> 01:22:15,780
They're like,
let me just try one of those raviolis

1758
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:18,330
and then all of a sudden I eat like
fucking three dinners.

1759
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,800
So I weigh more than i ever have weighed
in my entire life right now.

1760
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,450
Wow.
One 93,

1761
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:25,500
five,
10.

1762
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,730
Yeah.
Wow.

1763
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,960
I think again,
I go to the gym on a regular basis and I

1764
01:22:30,961 --> 01:22:32,940
left and said like that.
But yeah,

1765
01:22:32,941 --> 01:22:35,800
I fucking 193 pounds.
Yeah,

1766
01:22:35,801 --> 01:22:38,340
it's the pasta and bread man.
If you just cut all that stuff out,

1767
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:39,940
you'll drop a shitload of weight right
away.

1768
01:22:39,941 --> 01:22:41,970
I could be in the family goat.
That'll help.

1769
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:45,180
That was one of the things when we were
talking about that I think is kind of

1770
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,760
reporting like when you're talking about
um,

1771
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,980
immigration and bad apples and stuff
like that.

1772
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,410
I look at immigration that same way.
I look at gun control,

1773
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:56,010
like most people that have guns are laW
abiding citizens.

1774
01:22:56,011 --> 01:22:57,780
And it's not going to be a problem.
The vast,

1775
01:22:57,781 --> 01:23:00,810
vast majority.
And I think that's the same case with

1776
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,050
immigration and the same case with
people coming to America,

1777
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:06,160
even illegally,
they want to do Better.

1778
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,690
That's why they're coming here.
They're not coming here because they

1779
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:11,800
want to start crying and they,
most of them are coming here because

1780
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:14,770
they want opportunities with guns.
I totally agree.

1781
01:23:14,771 --> 01:23:17,610
I want a shotgun so badly when I needed
a double barrel.

1782
01:23:17,611 --> 01:23:21,240
Like I want a shotgun and uM,
I've shot a lot of guns should,

1783
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:24,310
especially with the daily show.
I've done chuck jones for the daily

1784
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:25,740
shot.
Got tori.

1785
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:27,740
Yeah.
I was going to be telling jokes,

1786
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:30,900
going to have to learn how to fucking
clear room and defend yourself.

1787
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,090
Okay.
All right.

1788
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:36,610
Now this is a thompson machine gun
discipline.

1789
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:38,430
Very important for the dailies.
Cheryl,

1790
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:43,310
a 50 caliber sniper busters.
50 calibers are ridiculous.

1791
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,010
Dude,
I will show you a video after this.

1792
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:50,000
Actually,
maybe this hasn't really even aired

1793
01:23:50,001 --> 01:23:52,410
because it was part of a pilot that I
did that did.

1794
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:55,260
I did a pilot for comedy central when I
left the daily show.

1795
01:23:55,261 --> 01:23:57,460
It was an anti travel show called
displaced.

1796
01:23:57,461 --> 01:23:58,294
Sucks.

1797
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:02,730
Didn't go through.
I'll send it to you.

1798
01:24:02,731 --> 01:24:03,780
Great idea.
Just the con

1799
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,420
dude.
It's the fucking funny.

1800
01:24:05,421 --> 01:24:06,510
You know what they said?
Well,

1801
01:24:06,511 --> 01:24:09,110
I mean,
everybody said it was too mean.

1802
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,630
It's fucking hilarious.
I go,

1803
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,010
we stayed in Kansas city.
I go,

1804
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:14,270
hey everybody.
My name's al madrigal.

1805
01:24:14,271 --> 01:24:16,190
I'm in Kansas city.
I'm going to tell you why this place

1806
01:24:16,191 --> 01:24:17,024
sucks.

1807
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,840
Just shit all over it and it to just do
that online.

1808
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,220
Oh yeah.
I should just put them out.

1809
01:24:23,221 --> 01:24:25,350
Soy diet is a great idea for all things
comedy.

1810
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:27,320
why don't you just like buy our main
idea?

1811
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:29,160
I totally just,
you own the idea,

1812
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,050
my idea.
Oh my god,

1813
01:24:31,051 --> 01:24:33,000
that's a great idea.
so the idea,

1814
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:35,000
like as soon as you set it up,
you know,

1815
01:24:35,001 --> 01:24:37,980
someone says an idea in a light bulb
goes off a real idea,

1816
01:24:37,981 --> 01:24:41,640
and I do it in san francisco when I do
it at san francisco is fucking filthy.

1817
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:44,250
It is one of the dirtiest cities I've
ever been in my entire life.

1818
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:48,720
And also it's like filled with rich
douche bags now because of the internet.

1819
01:24:48,721 --> 01:24:51,720
Boom.
And then all this tech boom and the poor

1820
01:24:51,721 --> 01:24:54,090
people are getting moved out.
There's so much stuff to make fun of.

1821
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,340
So anyway,
I'm paid fun of aI.

1822
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:58,350
went to this place,
omb,

1823
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:02,730
guns and I shot machine guns,
handguns,

1824
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,720
like a shot,
everything.

1825
01:25:03,721 --> 01:25:07,290
And then for the daily show I went and I
drove a tank.

1826
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:11,370
I got to drive tanks.
I was doing this chieftain tanks that I

1827
01:25:11,371 --> 01:25:14,400
was driving.
I got to run over to saturn's in a tank.

1828
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:17,280
Really fucking awesome.
How do you drive a tank?

1829
01:25:17,281 --> 01:25:18,360
Like What do you,
what do you,

1830
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,070
you know?
Yeah,

1831
01:25:20,071 --> 01:25:23,160
it's levers and there's a.
So um,

1832
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:25,170
yeah,
you could watch and there was this hot

1833
01:25:25,171 --> 01:25:30,171
chick that they had that was working
there that was on it with me and at the

1834
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:33,210
same place I got to fire machine guns.

1835
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:38,210
But I feel like when it comes to
automatic weapons and a 50 caliber

1836
01:25:38,521 --> 01:25:43,050
sniper buster and all that shit,
I don't understand why you need to own

1837
01:25:43,051 --> 01:25:44,760
that.
I liked shooting it.

1838
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:47,490
I'll go shoot that stuff again.
I really enjoyed it.

1839
01:25:47,491 --> 01:25:49,500
And you can see me shoot that 50 caliber
thing,

1840
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:53,220
like there was a shockwave,
like your,

1841
01:25:53,221 --> 01:25:57,420
your head flies,
but you couldn't watch my arms and the

1842
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:02,480
skin on my arms ripple after I fucking.
Because I wore a sleeveless shirt.

1843
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:06,170
Shoot It.
Boom.

1844
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,910
Wow.
And uh,

1845
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,250
I enjoyed it.
I liked shooting that shit.

1846
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:14,360
I want the shotgun to defend my house
when everything goes to hell.

1847
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:16,700
I'll be approximate zombie apocalypse
and nice shotgun.

1848
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:21,530
I want just somebody to here get the
fuck away from the door.

1849
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:24,050
You know,
I have by my bed right now.

1850
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,870
Hammers,
hammer.

1851
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:31,100
I have a hammer like bill makes it
thinks it's the craziest thing.

1852
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:34,250
Like you keep it by your bed.
I keep a hammer under my bed.

1853
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:37,640
Like I'm going to fucking get up and
close contact.

1854
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:39,470
Like hammering somebody with death.
Yeah.

1855
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:43,460
It seems like you've thought it through,
like really,

1856
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:49,280
really like on a surface level.
I have a magnum flashlight and high flat

1857
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:50,510
magnum flashlight.
Yeah.

1858
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:51,590
Peter,
that always kIlls me.

1859
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:53,420
That people think they're going to club
somebody with flashlight.

1860
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:53,900
No,
no.

1861
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,300
I want to.
I'm a flashlight in one hand.

1862
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:59,150
So lined him and then fucking run in and
my hammer.

1863
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:03,140
why not a real weapon?
I want a real one.

1864
01:27:03,141 --> 01:27:05,360
I got knives.
I have all closed.

1865
01:27:05,361 --> 01:27:08,300
Contacted me.
Never got a gun on my wife second.

1866
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:09,500
Oh,
one of them.

1867
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:11,450
Yup.
I'll get one.

1868
01:27:11,451 --> 01:27:12,690
I'm working on her.
She's good.

1869
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:13,580
She gets it.
Yeah.

1870
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:15,590
We've got to do as a false flag in the
house.

1871
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,960
Hire some friends of brick in.
Oh yeah,

1872
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:18,853
that's a good idea.

1873
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,680
Not false flag.
The dick cheney of households.

1874
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:26,370
Oh zero.
Um,

1875
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:29,120
yeah.
I want the gun badly.

1876
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:34,180
But I feel like with an ak 47 and maybe
people can write like only bad things

1877
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:38,990
have happened with people.
You know a district is responsible gun

1878
01:27:38,991 --> 01:27:40,800
owners.
But you look at dylan roof and you look

1879
01:27:40,801 --> 01:27:44,360
at columbine,
you look at all these people getting

1880
01:27:44,361 --> 01:27:48,470
shot up everywhere and seeing the hook.
Like I don't want that to happen.

1881
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,600
I don't want my kids.
I was walking away.

1882
01:27:50,601 --> 01:27:52,670
I was safe.
You put your guns in a safe.

1883
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:57,380
Why do you need an ak 47?
Don't you don't need an ak 47.

1884
01:27:58,410 --> 01:28:00,580
I'm saying to have all the handgun,
but the thing is like,

1885
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:02,810
who should be able to decide who gets
what.

1886
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,090
That's where it gets weird.
yeah.

1887
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:08,120
And what about silencers to.
Well,

1888
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:10,070
here's the thing in,
in europe,

1889
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:15,190
silencers are thought of as a polite
thing because we're over in America

1890
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:16,850
worried about shooting people.

1891
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:19,040
They're worrying about noise.
So like if you have a,

1892
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,070
what they call suppressor,
that suppressor,

1893
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,540
like if you're hunting,
you would hunt with a suppressor on

1894
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:25,010
because you don't want to blow your
fucking ears.

1895
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,110
Man.
I'll put the links out to these two

1896
01:28:27,111 --> 01:28:30,860
pieces that I did a daily show spots.
I'll do the one.

1897
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,980
If you go to my thing that twitter,
uh,

1898
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:34,814
I'll,
uh,

1899
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:36,620
I'll put it on.
I'll send them to you.

1900
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:39,260
That when I drove a tank and fired all
those guns.

1901
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,370
And then I did a silencer piece as well.
And the guy was saying he wanted to

1902
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:48,371
protect kids ears with the silencers.
And that's what Donald Trump is saying.

1903
01:28:49,281 --> 01:28:51,410
Kids.
And I'm worried.

1904
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,360
the reality is though,
and this is true,

1905
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:57,950
I know a lot of friends that are hunters
that shot guns as kids and they're

1906
01:28:57,951 --> 01:29:00,050
fucked up now.
They're ears are a mess.

1907
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,370
They the.
They should,

1908
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:05,130
but they didn't when they were younger
because they didn't know any better.

1909
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:08,900
See,
20 years ago people didn't know that you

1910
01:29:08,901 --> 01:29:10,620
were going to do permanent damage to
your ears.

1911
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:11,520
They didn't.
You didn't need.

1912
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:13,890
Never heard about it.
Like these people just shotguns,

1913
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:18,930
but I think also the uNfortunate reality
now is that you Could have somebody

1914
01:29:18,931 --> 01:29:23,880
walking around undetected shooting,
shooting people in a college and you

1915
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:28,500
could call it why I did,
I was on kcrw and walking around the

1916
01:29:28,501 --> 01:29:32,100
Santa monica campus and I really did
think I'm like,

1917
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:35,180
okay,
who's the shooter Coast water?

1918
01:29:35,181 --> 01:29:38,260
And then it shouldn't be a thought that.
No,

1919
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:39,480
it shouldn't.
Yeah.

1920
01:29:39,481 --> 01:29:42,990
I mean it's a mental health issue when
he was like the only person that's

1921
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:44,790
capable of doing that as a person who's
sick.

1922
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:45,661
Yeah.
You know,

1923
01:29:45,661 --> 01:29:49,440
and that's the other thing that doesn't
come up when you're talking about mass

1924
01:29:49,441 --> 01:29:52,530
shootings is whenever you hear about it,
the news,

1925
01:29:52,531 --> 01:29:56,010
nobody makes the correlation,
the inescapable correlation between

1926
01:29:56,011 --> 01:30:01,011
psychoactive drugs and mass shootings
because there's a lot of fucking mass

1927
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:03,660
shooters,
like almost all of them that are either

1928
01:30:03,661 --> 01:30:08,661
on pharmaceutical drugs like ssri
disassociative drugs or they're getting

1929
01:30:09,091 --> 01:30:11,250
off of um,
anti psychotic drugs.

1930
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:14,490
There's what can be done is you're like,
there is no common ground.

1931
01:30:14,491 --> 01:30:17,550
We started having people make.
We live in this country where you should

1932
01:30:17,551 --> 01:30:22,551
be able to do whatever you want and hAve
whatever you want.

1933
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:26,430
But then who gets to decide who gets
crushed in what guns?

1934
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:30,150
Well,
Texas has sort of taken the idea that

1935
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:34,260
just everyBody has a gun,
a well armed society is a polite

1936
01:30:34,261 --> 01:30:35,350
society.
Well,

1937
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:39,270
my ron white all of a sudden,
and then teachers should have guns in

1938
01:30:39,271 --> 01:30:41,010
the classroom.
And bulletproof helmets,

1939
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:43,710
full vests.
Jesus,

1940
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:45,690
ak,
47 is right there,

1941
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:46,830
right there.
Put down the truck.

1942
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,450
I don't know man.
It sucks yet.

1943
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:52,500
Think about it.
There's no easy solution.

1944
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:54,480
Yeah,
well it just,

1945
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:57,000
every time.
one of those things happens,

1946
01:30:57,001 --> 01:31:00,240
everybody buckles down and wants to take
away guns and try to figure out

1947
01:31:00,241 --> 01:31:04,080
legislation and I just feel like the
root of the problem is not the tools

1948
01:31:04,081 --> 01:31:04,870
that people are using.

1949
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:07,020
It's the fact that someone's willing to
use those tools,

1950
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,700
the fact that someone is willing to do
that,

1951
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:13,230
the fact that those guns are more
accessible is a genuine issue.

1952
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,440
But I think we can all agree that no one
came for the guns.

1953
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:17,760
Uh,
obama,

1954
01:31:17,761 --> 01:31:20,110
every single obama's coming for the guns
will.

1955
01:31:20,111 --> 01:31:22,020
Do you know why he knows deanna,
right?

1956
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:24,810
Because the nra is too strong.
The lobbies too strong,

1957
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,390
they,
they've spent a shitload of money and

1958
01:31:27,391 --> 01:31:29,970
continue to spend a shitload of money to
make sure they protect the second

1959
01:31:29,971 --> 01:31:32,780
amendment rights.
So you're saying if they will,

1960
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:37,260
if not for the nra,
dash a hundred percent have taken all

1961
01:31:37,261 --> 01:31:38,610
the guns,
they would have definitely done

1962
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:42,510
something similar to what Australia did.
Australia essentially made gun ownership

1963
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,410
very,
very,

1964
01:31:43,411 --> 01:31:45,900
very difficult.
They took away guns.

1965
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:48,420
They,
they enact a very strict laws and they

1966
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,810
had like one mass shooting at a long
time ago.

1967
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:53,010
Had a big mass shooting a long time ago.
That's the thing.

1968
01:31:53,011 --> 01:31:55,840
That's the only habit is like these big
mass shootings,

1969
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,060
you know,
when you see.

1970
01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:00,730
But Australia has the same amount of
people's California and it's the size of

1971
01:32:00,731 --> 01:32:02,410
the United States.
Yeah.

1972
01:32:02,411 --> 01:32:03,730
They just,
I just saw the thing.

1973
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:06,370
There was a map comparisons until your
mind is like,

1974
01:32:06,371 --> 01:32:10,210
it's the exact same says yeah,
it's crazy and people are spread way

1975
01:32:10,211 --> 01:32:14,230
spread out and it's the same amount of
people's los angeles and it's in this

1976
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:17,770
giant ass fucking country.
So when you think about being able to

1977
01:32:17,771 --> 01:32:21,070
take people's guns in Australia,
it's different.

1978
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:22,210
The culture is different.
The,

1979
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:24,400
the idea of independence is different
over there.

1980
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:26,600
we have a different attitude over here.
yeah.

1981
01:32:26,601 --> 01:32:28,170
I just don't want to.
um,

1982
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,510
yeah.
When you have little kids again.

1983
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,750
Yeah.
Your changes,

1984
01:32:33,751 --> 01:32:34,570
you know,
or just like,

1985
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:35,500
I don't want ever.

1986
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:39,310
Why worry about them growing up in a
society where a teacher does have to

1987
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:41,470
think about wearing a fucking helmet.
Of course,

1988
01:32:41,471 --> 01:32:43,210
of course.
I mean nobody wants to think that.

1989
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:46,270
I don't know what the solution is,
but the solution.

1990
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:50,410
Look,
getting the guns away from the people.

1991
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:55,240
There's more guns than there are human
beings in America and they're not.

1992
01:32:55,450 --> 01:33:00,450
They're not going to stop making guns.
No good business guns of the problem.

1993
01:33:00,881 --> 01:33:02,080
I really don't.
I mean,

1994
01:33:02,081 --> 01:33:03,890
I support gun ownership.
I really do.

1995
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:08,350
I don't think that's the issue.
I think the issue is that we saw in

1996
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:12,670
France and nice that some crazy fucking
take a car and kill 100 people by

1997
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:16,060
plowing over pizza and just started
stabbing people to get out of the car

1998
01:33:16,061 --> 01:33:18,190
and just fucking start stabbing folks.
There's,

1999
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,910
there's ways that people lose their
fucking minds and do horrible things to

2000
01:33:21,911 --> 01:33:24,490
people and the ways are not things you
have to take away.

2001
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,950
You have to figure out a way and not
take away all hammers.

2002
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:29,440
No,
I don't know what the solution is,

2003
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:33,790
but I don't think anybody does.
But I think what you're getting at with

2004
01:33:33,791 --> 01:33:36,340
the mental health stuff is there.
I'm not opposed to there being a

2005
01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:39,850
screening process and seeing if you have
a history of violence.

2006
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,713
Of course.
Yeah.

2007
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:41,770
And,
uh,

2008
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:45,820
if you are show up on a terrorist watch
list and that's where I think the nra

2009
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:49,120
goes overboard,
like if you're on a fucking terrorist

2010
01:33:49,121 --> 01:33:51,490
watch list,
who doesn't agree with that?

2011
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:53,710
Well,
the only problem with thAt is who gets

2012
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:56,500
to decide who's on the terrorist watch
list because there was people that were

2013
01:33:56,501 --> 01:33:57,970
um,
from uh,

2014
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:02,620
the green party that were put on
terrorist watch list after nine slash 11

2015
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:06,070
because they were anti war protesters
and they were put on no fly list.

2016
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:09,120
There was a lot of weird shit that
happened where people were put on lists

2017
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,440
because they pissed off the wrong
people.

2018
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:14,560
And you know,
in 2001 it was way easier to do

2019
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:17,710
something like that,
but it is to go to buy a gun and then

2020
01:34:17,711 --> 01:34:19,570
they say,
I'm sure he can purchase his weapon

2021
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:23,170
because you're on that list.
And then you go to a gun show that's

2022
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:25,690
part of the problem.
You go to a gun show and you can buy a

2023
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:28,960
gun far easier in Kansas city trying to
tighten that down though.

2024
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:30,310
Kansas,
Kansas,

2025
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:35,320
you can go and correct me If I'm wrong,
it didn't choke up.

2026
01:34:35,321 --> 01:34:40,321
This place sucks.
What am I still go to Kansas and then

2027
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:43,360
you can get a gun with.
No,

2028
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:48,110
you don't.
You can just an id Kansas id and get it

2029
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:50,830
in maybe like five minutes.
Zero traIn.

2030
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:51,640
It's nothing.

2031
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,920
Just you get it right away.
You don't have to have a background

2032
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:54,754
check.
Nothing.

2033
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:56,260
So is that true?
Yes.

2034
01:34:56,710 --> 01:35:00,340
Was that like when you did in 2014?
I did this Piece yet.

2035
01:35:00,341 --> 01:35:01,300
But you can look at it.
Can we,

2036
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,610
can we check the gun laws?
Kansas?

2037
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:06,170
No background check.
No background check.

2038
01:35:06,171 --> 01:35:09,680
I'm pretty certain.
So why wouldn't you have to disclose in

2039
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:11,300
Kansas?
Listening to this guy he does with his

2040
01:35:11,301 --> 01:35:15,080
grandma,
he walks into this place and he goes,

2041
01:35:15,081 --> 01:35:17,240
uh,
I can't.

2042
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:22,010
The guy says I caN't buy the gun,
but she can like that he buys these four

2043
01:35:22,011 --> 01:35:24,230
guns or something.
Kills a bunch of people.

2044
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,020
So federal law requires federallY
licensed firearms dealers but not

2045
01:35:30,021 --> 01:35:34,970
private sellers to initiate a background
check on the purchase purchaser prior to

2046
01:35:34,971 --> 01:35:36,440
sale a firearm.
As a result,

2047
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:39,890
concealed weapons license holders in
Kansas are exempt from the federal

2048
01:35:39,891 --> 01:35:41,270
background check requirement.

2049
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:42,200
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2050
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:43,730
No training,
no background check hold on.

2051
01:35:43,731 --> 01:35:47,150
A second.
Concealed weapons license holders like

2052
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:48,920
you have to have a concealed weapons
license,

2053
01:35:48,921 --> 01:35:53,240
which is difficult to acquire and it's
not easy to get a concealed weapons

2054
01:35:53,241 --> 01:35:55,610
license unless they have a different
law,

2055
01:35:55,611 --> 01:35:58,430
theIr background checks and cans,
concealed weapon,

2056
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:02,240
but I think concealed weapons is like
the hardest thing to get is a concealed

2057
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:05,390
carry.
Federal law provides states with the

2058
01:36:05,391 --> 01:36:09,230
options of serving as state.
Kansas has no law requiring firearms

2059
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:12,890
dealers to initiate background checks
prior to transferring a firearm.

2060
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,610
As a result in Kansas,
firearms dealers must initiate the

2061
01:36:16,611 --> 01:36:18,770
backgrouNd check required by federal
law,

2062
01:36:18,771 --> 01:36:23,771
bY contacting the fbi directly.
Kansas is not a point of contact state,

2063
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:27,650
huh?
So they have to contact the fbi.

2064
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:31,130
A federal law does not require dealers
to conduct a background check of a

2065
01:36:31,131 --> 01:36:33,680
firearm.
Purchaser presents a state permit to

2066
01:36:33,681 --> 01:36:35,270
purchase or possess firearms.

2067
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:39,800
It meets certain conditions.
So it seems like tHere's definitely some

2068
01:36:39,801 --> 01:36:40,940
wiggle room.
Yeah,

2069
01:36:40,941 --> 01:36:41,421
yeah,
for sure.

2070
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:43,250
And then you know,
that's an area is talking about these

2071
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:47,360
gun shows where you can just go gobble
up a bunch of firearms and that he can

2072
01:36:47,361 --> 01:36:49,250
bring them into.
That's what they just transport them

2073
01:36:49,251 --> 01:36:53,690
across state lines and it's one of those
things like many human issues where

2074
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:57,290
there's not a whole lot of like clear
paths.

2075
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:00,560
It's like there's so many guns.
You're never going to take them all away

2076
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:02,520
from people.
And should you take them all away from

2077
01:37:02,521 --> 01:37:04,490
him?
Like if a guy like you as a gun,

2078
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:09,110
I don't feel like danger a threat unless
you get in one of your god damn tirade.

2079
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:11,570
He might maybe have another best example

2080
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:14,960
that hack
fucking stealing.

2081
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,153
So

2082
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,190
did you hear that?
Bit like a.

2083
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,340
Not a bid.
The video.

2084
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:26,260
Carlos min sia was on joey diaz a show
saying that he thought about bringing a

2085
01:37:26,261 --> 01:37:28,360
gun around,
going to the comedy store and shooting

2086
01:37:28,361 --> 01:37:29,990
people and he was carrying a gun in his
car.

2087
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,590
Like,
no way,

2088
01:37:31,591 --> 01:37:35,190
I'm crazy while there maybe you
shouldn't have a gun.

2089
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:38,000
That'S where I started thinking about
Ohio,

2090
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,510
which brings me back and then started
thinking about,

2091
01:37:40,810 --> 01:37:42,040
you know,
I look at redfin,

2092
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:43,570
trulia.
I would go to,

2093
01:37:43,571 --> 01:37:44,980
oh,
I'm living out there and you live in

2094
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:47,380
Ohio was weird.
Checking out.

2095
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:49,150
I was in Ohio recently.
It's weird.

2096
01:37:49,151 --> 01:37:50,470
Really?
Yeah.

2097
01:37:50,471 --> 01:37:52,930
Everybody talks about how great it is.
I think the resort is great.

2098
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:56,000
Oh yeah.
We did an airbnb out there in Ohio

2099
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:57,450
was like,
eh,

2100
01:37:57,451 --> 01:38:00,180
that's true.
Not feeling would have been nice

2101
01:38:00,181 --> 01:38:04,160
restaurants.
What about when you get out to like

2102
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:05,640
cdot?
Oh,

2103
01:38:05,641 --> 01:38:09,150
that's fucking beautiful.
That's like one percent or that's like

2104
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:12,990
$12,000,000 house territory.
That's really a saudi arabian.

2105
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:17,210
Sheik has a beautiful rich people found
a good spot.

2106
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:19,380
Yeah,
they really did have.

2107
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:20,970
I liked that.
Santa barbara.

2108
01:38:20,971 --> 01:38:24,120
I liked it.
See any as I like to go up the coast to

2109
01:38:24,121 --> 01:38:26,080
verbally looks this.
You want to go look at deck kane?

2110
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:27,810
Bria,
where's that?

2111
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:31,200
That's in the middle of California.
It's Just a coastal town.

2112
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:33,050
There's a place called avalon beach.
It's all.

2113
01:38:33,051 --> 01:38:35,040
It gets into like san louis obispo
county,

2114
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:39,240
a random middle of people haven't.
It's a little bit too far to drive.

2115
01:38:39,241 --> 01:38:41,690
It'll take like three and a half hours
at la.

2116
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:44,790
Little town.
Walked to the coffee place with the

2117
01:38:44,791 --> 01:38:47,490
dogs.
My buddy john hackleman lives in san

2118
01:38:47,491 --> 01:38:49,290
luis obispo,
who's a chocolate.

2119
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:54,530
So I'm a karate training.
I would say accounts probably with a

2120
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,550
chocolate down.
Did you really didn't know him or

2121
01:38:56,551 --> 01:38:58,590
anything?
I just knew that fuckIng guy.

2122
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:04,110
What is this?
Tambria is pretty.

2123
01:39:04,410 --> 01:39:05,430
Yeah,
just the one.

2124
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:06,330
Oh,
yep.

2125
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:07,740
Yeah,
that's pretty.

2126
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:09,960
It looks quiet.
But uh,

2127
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:12,810
san luis obispo for fucking great.
There's no one there.

2128
01:39:12,811 --> 01:39:15,180
It's just the college and it's real
quiet.

2129
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:20,250
morro bay is also another big rock and
then you can just go fish.

2130
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:23,370
You can do a bunch of shit like that.
So that's again,

2131
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:28,440
I'm,
I am so high strung and I do feel like

2132
01:39:28,441 --> 01:39:32,790
I'm prone to like I can't be walking
around telling dads at my school to fuck

2133
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:35,670
off and do that.
I told one guy to go find go,

2134
01:39:35,671 --> 01:39:37,950
you're a fucking asshole.
You know what happened?

2135
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:41,160
You're just re.
He's a fucking dick to my son.

2136
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:42,870
The dad was,
dad was,

2137
01:39:42,871 --> 01:39:45,120
he was a basketball coach and I saw him.

2138
01:39:45,150 --> 01:39:45,983
I go,
hey,

2139
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:47,880
real asshole,
you know that.

2140
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,820
Well,
and uh,

2141
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,930
because no dad's talked to each other
like that,

2142
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:57,300
and I call this guy an asshole and I
felt bad.

2143
01:39:57,301 --> 01:39:59,940
I can feel fucking band.
I don't want to do it,

2144
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:04,470
but I did it.
And he's a dick and everybody knows he's

2145
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:07,200
a fucking dick in your coach.
Hey,

2146
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:08,480
coach at a school.
Yeah.

2147
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:11,460
Is it still there or is it done and he's
done.

2148
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:12,563
He's done.
Yeah.

2149
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:14,340
well,
it's a lot of people that can't let the

2150
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:15,690
stress of being a comic.
Right.

2151
01:40:15,691 --> 01:40:18,270
It's one kras trust.
Imagine the stress of dealing with

2152
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:22,530
hormonally active seventeen-year-old
every fucking year.

2153
01:40:22,531 --> 01:40:27,330
New ones coming in.
Just chaos younger team now.

2154
01:40:27,331 --> 01:40:30,000
Not even that.
Just being an asshole to an 11 year old.

2155
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:30,481
Oh,
well,

2156
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:31,520
he's a piece of shit.
Yeah,

2157
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,433
exactly.
Yeah.

2158
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:36,690
Well there's a lot of fucking stress and
raIsing people and teaching kids and

2159
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,700
dealing with the problems that kids
present.

2160
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,370
You know,
a lot of people that just.

2161
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:41,940
Here's another thing that's going on
today.

2162
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,810
People think that they can have a kid
and then have careers too,

2163
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:48,840
and everyone's having a career at the
mom has a career that data as a career,

2164
01:40:48,841 --> 01:40:52,140
but he has a career and when you're
watching the kid who's paying attention

2165
01:40:52,141 --> 01:40:54,070
to the kid.
I went to a party and I've talked

2166
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,290
about this in the podcast before.
This one little kid was just running

2167
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:59,890
around hitting everybody and do it.
The parents are inside drinking there in

2168
01:40:59,891 --> 01:41:02,710
the party drinking and the kids out
there with the other kids and then

2169
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:04,630
finally the guy comes down to apologize.
I'm sorry.

2170
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,250
He's a good kid.
He's not a good kid.

2171
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,990
like he's hit three kids.
Yeah,

2172
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:08,381
yeah,
yeah.

2173
01:41:08,381 --> 01:41:09,610
I told them when he,
what the kid did,

2174
01:41:09,611 --> 01:41:10,510
he goes,
he never did that.

2175
01:41:10,511 --> 01:41:12,100
I go,
I saw him do that.

2176
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:14,050
Watch your son being and the guys,
like I said,

2177
01:41:14,051 --> 01:41:14,831
I'm sorry.
I'm like,

2178
01:41:14,831 --> 01:41:16,420
oh my god,
I want to kill you.

2179
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:19,030
Do you understand?
I want to grab your neck and choke the

2180
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:20,830
life out of you.
I'm containing mySelf.

2181
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:21,900
You fucking cunt.
Yes.

2182
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:23,440
So I get into putting those seeds.
Yeah,

2183
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:26,470
but I keep it cool.
I keep it called magic.

2184
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:29,260
How do you do it?
I don't know if i.

2185
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:31,420
Because I practice murder on a daily
basis.

2186
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:34,480
oh my god.
I just murdered a punching bag or run up

2187
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:36,040
hills.
I get it out of my system.

2188
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:41,070
Birch just told me this story about you
exercising sets come a un tate and that

2189
01:41:45,821 --> 01:41:49,900
guy with his shirt off that was trying
to get into your hotel room.

2190
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:54,220
Oh yeah.
And I would've fucking.

2191
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:56,480
I don't know what I would've done if I'm
not going to,

2192
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:57,530
you know,
that's the other thIng.

2193
01:41:57,531 --> 01:42:00,580
It's like I would just put it,
that guy wound up being unconscious

2194
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,400
tape,
put them to sleep to choke them

2195
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:05,590
unconscious.
But it was nice to him.

2196
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:08,320
He could have taken his life.
That guy was a real piece of shit.

2197
01:42:08,321 --> 01:42:12,010
He was a big giant dude.
He was like six foot six and he was a

2198
01:42:12,011 --> 01:42:14,410
bully and he thought because he was so
tall,

2199
01:42:14,411 --> 01:42:15,700
he thought that people were scared of
him,

2200
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:19,960
but you know he fucked with the wrong
guy in tate.

2201
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:23,590
First of all,
a guy who's been arrested,

2202
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:27,400
been around bad people his whole life,
been in numerous treat.

2203
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:30,310
fights was a professIonal fighter,
was on the ultimate fighter,

2204
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:34,450
was a black belt In jujitsu,
mean everything was wrong and tate was

2205
01:42:34,451 --> 01:42:39,230
trying to be calm with the guy and the
way tate handled it like he it.

2206
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:44,170
They fought in a hotel lobby right in
front of the elevator and the guy was

2207
01:42:44,171 --> 01:42:46,270
pounded on his door saying,
you're in my fucking room.

2208
01:42:46,271 --> 01:42:49,630
I think I was just a cunt.
And a tape was like,

2209
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,231
no,
look,

2210
01:42:50,231 --> 01:42:52,030
my key works here.
It's definitely my room.

2211
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:53,580
And he shuts the door and he was,
hey,

2212
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:55,650
fucking faggot.
you think you can get away with shutting

2213
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:57,990
this fucking door?
Who was open this fucking door?

2214
01:42:58,010 --> 01:43:01,510
Told you in my room and then we all went
outside.

2215
01:43:01,511 --> 01:43:03,630
It was me and eddie,
bravo and tate.

2216
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:05,890
We're looking at this guy and we're
lookIng at his friend and we're trying

2217
01:43:05,891 --> 01:43:08,280
to figure out how we're going to do this
like this.

2218
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:09,550
This has to be dealt with.
Like,

2219
01:43:09,551 --> 01:43:10,960
this is not a guy that's going to go
away.

2220
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:16,050
He was a big drunk dumb guy and tate
decides the way to handle it is,

2221
01:43:17,810 --> 01:43:18,370
um,
you know,

2222
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:19,900
there's a bunch of words being
exchanged.

2223
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,690
So tate decides he,
uh,

2224
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:27,750
he kicks the guy in a legs in the leg
and then he grabs them and pulls him on

2225
01:43:28,031 --> 01:43:31,510
top of him.
So the guy like literally has no idea,

2226
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:34,840
like why?
So he kicks his leg,

2227
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:38,740
grabs them and pulls them on top of them
and pulls them into what's called the

2228
01:43:38,741 --> 01:43:39,510
guard,
you know,

2229
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:43,330
like in jujitsu and then wraps them up
and something called an omoplata,

2230
01:43:43,331 --> 01:43:45,070
which is a shoulder lock.
So he throws,

2231
01:43:45,071 --> 01:43:48,280
I mean,
this is all instantaneous kick pole

2232
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:50,380
throws his shoulder over them.

2233
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:54,680
Then the security guard show up,
the security guard show up and they go,

2234
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:55,161
hey,
hey,

2235
01:43:55,161 --> 01:43:56,870
hey,
what the fuck is going on?

2236
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:58,730
And I go,
relax.

2237
01:43:58,731 --> 01:43:59,780
I go,
everything's gonna.

2238
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:02,120
Be fine.
He's just going to choke him to sleep

2239
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:04,580
and they got the security guard goes.
Joe rogan,

2240
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:06,260
joe rogan.
Holy shit,

2241
01:44:06,261 --> 01:44:08,360
man.
What are you doing here while I said

2242
01:44:08,361 --> 01:44:09,790
this,
like he's just gonna choke him asleep.

2243
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:10,790
Take goes.
All right.

2244
01:44:10,791 --> 01:44:12,110
I guess I'm going to choke them asleep
now.

2245
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:15,260
I mean this is all happening.
Within seconds.

2246
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:19,310
Tate sinks in a rear naked choke on this
guy and just squeezes them unconscious,

2247
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:22,130
gets off of them.
Doesn't hurt the guy at all.

2248
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:24,950
It doesn't hit him all.
He does kick his leg out from under him.

2249
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:26,990
Take them down,
choke them unconscious.

2250
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,050
The guy,
his friend picks his friend up.

2251
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:33,810
I and I go get your fucking friend and
get sober him up and get him out of

2252
01:44:33,811 --> 01:44:34,010
here.

2253
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:36,260
And he's lucky.
Nothing happened and he's like,

2254
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:37,430
sorry man,
my friends,

2255
01:44:37,431 --> 01:44:38,420
piece of shit.
I'm sorry.

2256
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:42,020
his friend picks his friend up.
the guys like delirious.

2257
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:45,020
They push them in an elevator elevator
door closes.

2258
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:47,600
He disappears from life.
Never seen him again.

2259
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:48,800
That's it.
The end of it.

2260
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:52,100
I'd take pictures with the fucking
security guards there smiling like it

2261
01:44:52,110 --> 01:44:53,600
was fine.
It goes a drunk asshole.

2262
01:44:53,610 --> 01:44:54,830
Just think we should call the cops.
I go,

2263
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:56,030
no,
I go,

2264
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:58,580
that guy's humiliated.
Like unless he comes back,

2265
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,680
he comes back,
he's going to get fucked up,

2266
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:03,440
but right now everything's fine.
Don't call the cops.

2267
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:05,350
So they laughing and everyone's
laughing.

2268
01:45:05,351 --> 01:45:07,940
We took a couple pictures together,
went back in the room,

2269
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,710
went and got some dinner and we were
laughing.

2270
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:14,320
Yeah.
But when that dad is in your face at the

2271
01:45:14,321 --> 01:45:16,780
party,
that exercise that come,

2272
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,080
uh,
is,

2273
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:19,270
is,
that's again,

2274
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:24,130
that's the thing that I struggled with
when mike costa is onstage and I'm being

2275
01:45:24,131 --> 01:45:26,380
completely honest.
Like again,

2276
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:30,250
this is how I feel and it's just
somebody that takes over and I'm like,

2277
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:32,110
I can't help but say,
hey,

2278
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:34,300
your son is hitting that guy.
Like,

2279
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:36,700
this is not cool.
This is not okay.

2280
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:40,810
Parents don't want their kids and their
kids are just compLete asshole.

2281
01:45:40,811 --> 01:45:42,400
Well,
they go to parties and they drink and

2282
01:45:42,401 --> 01:45:45,190
they leave the kIds outside and this
parents,

2283
01:45:45,191 --> 01:45:47,950
these particular parents,
they don't watch the kid ever.

2284
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:49,780
They.
This is like what they're famous for

2285
01:45:49,781 --> 01:45:52,210
apparently in their group that just
don't watch this kid.

2286
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,160
They just,
they don't want to be parents.

2287
01:45:54,161 --> 01:45:56,620
They became parents in their forties.
They didn't

2288
01:45:56,740 --> 01:46:00,250
really planned it out that I don't know
if the parents get along.

2289
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:02,380
I dunno.
I dunno how we put the whole thing looks

2290
01:46:02,381 --> 01:46:05,830
like a disaster and the kids a little
monster and they just are not.

2291
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:09,190
They're not disciplining him,
paying attention and like he literally

2292
01:46:09,191 --> 01:46:11,950
went out and talked to the kid and there
was some commotion going on.

2293
01:46:11,951 --> 01:46:14,080
Were people complaining about the kid
hitting somebody?

2294
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:17,320
He talked to the kid and then he high
fived him and then the kid went back to

2295
01:46:17,321 --> 01:46:19,640
doing it again.
I mean literally he went back inside to

2296
01:46:19,641 --> 01:46:21,250
drink.
The kid went back outside again.

2297
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:25,020
So at the end of the night when this guy
apologized to me like it,

2298
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,500
if the kid was doing it all,
now I go,

2299
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:28,090
hey man,
your kid is really aggressive.

2300
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:29,410
And he's like,
I'm sorry.

2301
01:46:29,411 --> 01:46:31,640
I'm sorry about the kid I go,
your kid is really aggressive with no,

2302
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,810
he's a good kid.
I go,

2303
01:46:32,811 --> 01:46:33,501
don't look.
He hit,

2304
01:46:33,501 --> 01:46:35,590
he hit three people.
I saw him hit people,

2305
01:46:35,770 --> 01:46:37,600
I saw them push a kid and call him a
loser.

2306
01:46:38,110 --> 01:46:40,450
I go,
he's fucking six and he's doing this.

2307
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:41,530
He goes,
that never happened.

2308
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:46,900
You know,
I had to understand consequences.

2309
01:46:46,901 --> 01:46:49,010
This is why I bite my tongue.
I understand like the,

2310
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:52,890
the actual consequences of,
of smacking this guy and his fucking

2311
01:46:52,891 --> 01:46:54,480
mouth,
which is what I wanted to do,

2312
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:55,513
you know?
Of course,

2313
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:58,620
if there was no consequences to doing
anything and I didn't think of him as a

2314
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:02,150
person.
I didn't think of him as a guy who just

2315
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,350
never raised the kid before,
hasn't really thought about it.

2316
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:06,180
Well,
has a big career,

2317
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:09,120
probably busy all the time.
Wife's busy all the time.

2318
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:11,940
Just not doing a good job raising a
little monster,

2319
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,270
you know,
drinking to try to drown out the facts.

2320
01:47:15,271 --> 01:47:16,470
Who knows why,
you know,

2321
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:18,390
drinking because he doesn't like being
married,

2322
01:47:18,391 --> 01:47:19,770
drinking because he doesn't like being a
dad.

2323
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:22,230
Drinking because he doesn't like being
sober.

2324
01:47:22,231 --> 01:47:23,220
Who knows?
I don't know.

2325
01:47:23,221 --> 01:47:25,860
I don't know the guy,
but in that moment when he's looking at

2326
01:47:25,861 --> 01:47:27,060
me and going,
that never happened.

2327
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:32,570
I just did just to the fucking sheer
ignorance and incompetence and

2328
01:47:33,901 --> 01:47:37,950
irresponsibility was just so infuriating
because I've watched my kids,

2329
01:47:37,990 --> 01:47:40,200
like I've watched them,
I talk to them,

2330
01:47:40,201 --> 01:47:42,720
I communicate with them.
I know I didn't have a good childhood,

2331
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:46,710
so for me it's important to be a good
dad and spend as much time as I can.

2332
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:48,870
Communicate,
explaining shit,

2333
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:51,090
talk to them,
treating them like I'm not just their

2334
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:52,890
dad,
but also I'm their friend and I care

2335
01:47:52,891 --> 01:47:53,600
about them.

2336
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,380
My wife is a first grade teacher and
she's become a educational therapists

2337
01:47:57,381 --> 01:48:01,430
right now,
so I'm like living with just the master

2338
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:04,910
at consequences.
Like if you don't eat in our house or

2339
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:08,480
decide you don't like broccoli,
nothing else is coming.

2340
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:15,230
Good kitchen is closed and that's when
people create monsters.

2341
01:48:15,231 --> 01:48:17,930
When they cater to them so much.
That's okay.

2342
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:21,380
Let me in and that's where you like your
kid only eats fucking rice.

2343
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,440
I have a friend who and he keeps feeding
this fucking kid sugar.

2344
01:48:24,441 --> 01:48:26,960
This kid just eats nothing but sugar all
day because he doesn't need.

2345
01:48:26,961 --> 01:48:27,581
He doesn't eat.
I go,

2346
01:48:27,581 --> 01:48:29,870
what do you mean he doesn't eat?
He's always eating cookies because he

2347
01:48:29,871 --> 01:48:30,704
won't eat his food.

2348
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:31,980
I got to feed him something.
I go,

2349
01:48:31,981 --> 01:48:32,814
no,
dude,

2350
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,430
you got to tell them you can't eat the
cookies.

2351
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,560
You've got food.
You've got actual food.

2352
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,840
This fucking kid is just eating nothing
but candy.

2353
01:48:39,841 --> 01:48:41,340
I mean it's.
It's bananas.

2354
01:48:41,341 --> 01:48:43,210
He's always got a soda in his hand.
Oh

2355
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:44,190
good.
He's six.

2356
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:47,790
He's fucking six and he's drinking a
full coke or you go over the house.

2357
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,850
The kid has a root beer.
We sell these kids.

2358
01:48:49,851 --> 01:48:54,851
We were on a flight and a saudis to
parents sit in first class and then come

2359
01:48:58,141 --> 01:48:59,880
back and check.
We didn't know what was going on and

2360
01:48:59,881 --> 01:49:02,910
coach.
They put three next to each other and

2361
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:06,090
coach some motherfuckers I know.
Crazy.

2362
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:07,920
Right?
And then everybody else has to do with

2363
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:10,260
their kid.
They gave each of them my pants.

2364
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:14,130
Right.
And then they waitress,

2365
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:18,870
the waitress or the stewardess comes by
and she looks at these three kids and

2366
01:49:18,871 --> 01:49:22,020
looks around for who they're with and
the one that will have the kids.

2367
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:27,080
I'm telling eight is the oldest one,
a maybe six and four.

2368
01:49:28,981 --> 01:49:31,290
Three just in a row.
Jesus christ,

2369
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:35,990
the oldest one goes three sprites,
sprites.

2370
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:38,370
This is a red eye,
is an overnight flight.

2371
01:49:38,910 --> 01:49:40,890
They're on ipads,
like just animals just

2372
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:48,670
don't stop trying to win something.
And then,

2373
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:51,190
um,
my wife were sort of laughing at first,

2374
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:54,880
but everybody in our family wants to go
to sleep.

2375
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:58,030
They already exhausted from being out
all day.

2376
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:01,270
I've never is a while ago.
I'll never be on this flight again.

2377
01:50:01,271 --> 01:50:03,220
No red eyes for me.
This horrible,

2378
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:05,260
horrible,
ruined for days,

2379
01:50:05,261 --> 01:50:06,520
two days afterwards.
You're fucked.

2380
01:50:06,610 --> 01:50:09,280
Yeah.
Tried to do anything in your power to

2381
01:50:09,281 --> 01:50:11,860
avoid a read.
I also try to do everything in your

2382
01:50:11,861 --> 01:50:16,780
power to avoid.
I'm looking at if you can fly nonstop,

2383
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:19,100
that's 100 percent.
Yep.

2384
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:24,690
So they get in a fight after a while,
start fighting because they're all

2385
01:50:25,391 --> 01:50:29,050
hopped up on sugar and they were staring
at the screen and fucking so then they

2386
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:33,900
started fighting and I think the mom or
the dad hears or somebody has to tap

2387
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:35,770
them to get up and me and my wife was
like,

2388
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:37,750
this is not okay.

2389
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:44,190
Nothing was said because again,
we just want to monitor on business.

2390
01:50:44,591 --> 01:50:46,390
Ideally,
again,

2391
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,120
ideally everyone minds their own
business.

2392
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:52,600
This is a new world though.
This world of electronic babysitters and

2393
01:50:52,601 --> 01:50:56,070
the world of putting the kids and coach
and you go into first class,

2394
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,840
like ignoring kids and it's these career
people.

2395
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:03,100
There's a lot of people that look,
they their career requires all their

2396
01:51:03,101 --> 01:51:04,630
time.
They justified by go look,

2397
01:51:04,631 --> 01:51:06,850
someone's gotta make the money in this
household so we can keep up this

2398
01:51:06,851 --> 01:51:08,500
lifestyle.
And so they're out there fucking

2399
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:10,630
grinding all day and then the kids are
just,

2400
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:15,160
what do I do?
It be me full circle to my dad passing

2401
01:51:15,161 --> 01:51:18,070
away.
He's at every single weekend and this is

2402
01:51:18,071 --> 01:51:22,900
why I bought that fj 62 lane cruiser
because every single weekend we went on

2403
01:51:22,901 --> 01:51:27,901
a little family trip and I looked at
myself and we'd go on family vacations

2404
01:51:28,331 --> 01:51:30,820
and stuff,
but the amount of time that my family

2405
01:51:30,821 --> 01:51:33,940
really spent together like a mom and a
dad,

2406
01:51:33,941 --> 01:51:35,740
like he would take us to yosemite.

2407
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:37,990
He would take us up the coast of
mendocino,

2408
01:51:37,991 --> 01:51:41,380
we'd go to marin or stinson beach and
all these places,

2409
01:51:41,381 --> 01:51:44,290
even in golden gate park.
Like he would just take us places,

2410
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,730
little adventures,
you know.

2411
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:51,120
And so I feel like we need to,
I get caught up in work working because

2412
01:51:51,410 --> 01:51:56,410
it just nonstop and I got to take a step
back and really spend as much time as I

2413
01:51:58,361 --> 01:52:00,130
possibly can.
So after that happened,

2414
01:52:00,131 --> 01:52:02,170
and this is june,
so almost a year ago,

2415
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:07,660
just really tried trim back.
I go to every single volleyball game.

2416
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:11,740
I go to every practice I possibly can,
you know,

2417
01:52:11,741 --> 01:52:14,770
and just force yourself to say this is
not,

2418
01:52:15,290 --> 01:52:18,010
it doesn't matter that much because you
look at all these deathbed.

2419
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:20,440
That's what I started looking at all
these deathbed regrets.

2420
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,060
Those are a bunch of lists that are out
there.

2421
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:25,600
Jesus,
too much time spent at work.

2422
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:29,770
yeah.
not enough time spent with people that I

2423
01:52:29,771 --> 01:52:30,700
love,
you know,

2424
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:32,560
and look at all these things and it's
like,

2425
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:35,320
fuck it,
I'm not having any of these regrets.

2426
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:38,650
So that's What I'm thinking.
I started looking at the real estate and

2427
01:52:38,651 --> 01:52:40,600
trying to look at getting away,
you know,

2428
01:52:40,601 --> 01:52:43,690
just really check it out.
And that's what I'm trying to hustle and

2429
01:52:43,691 --> 01:52:47,450
make as much money as I and kids who are
in a house.

2430
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,650
Where are you going to go?
That's what I'm checking into.

2431
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:52,250
That's what I know a lot about
cambridge.

2432
01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:56,980
That's a big sur or one of those places
I could go up there and you're,

2433
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,720
you're away and just live on the coast
and then be able to come back.

2434
01:52:59,721 --> 01:53:01,850
Like if I get an acting gig,
I love acting.

2435
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,170
I like,
I really enjoy it.

2436
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:08,590
I love writing too.
I was luckily had some success recently

2437
01:53:08,591 --> 01:53:13,591
as a comedy writer and um,
it's one of the cbs people I was trying

2438
01:53:15,201 --> 01:53:19,580
to match up with the latino show runner
and two years ago they go,

2439
01:53:19,590 --> 01:53:20,120
no,
no,

2440
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,270
that's,
that's you,

2441
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:22,520
you're going to be that guy.

2442
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:25,570
There aren't really any,
but we're grooming you to be that.

2443
01:53:25,571 --> 01:53:29,120
And I wrote too big scripts and then
that business background,

2444
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:33,350
I have the ability to do that.
I like,

2445
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:38,380
I like working with people and I think I
could staff up and do all that shit so I

2446
01:53:38,601 --> 01:53:42,940
could see myself splitting my time,
keeping my little house in la and then

2447
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:47,330
having a place in cambria or santa
barbara and just fucking go back and

2448
01:53:47,331 --> 01:53:48,470
forth.
Santa barbara is easy.

2449
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:51,560
It's only an hour,
hour and 10 just living on the beach and

2450
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:56,590
have a blue heeler be able to sit back
and watch the ocean.

2451
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,200
Just calm yourself,
calm yourself,

2452
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:02,090
you know.
And that's what,

2453
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:05,270
again,
fucking ari shaffir said that when he

2454
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:09,920
was walking on a beach and he needed to
walk to a restaurant,

2455
01:54:09,921 --> 01:54:14,240
40 minutes,
that he had this feeling in his head

2456
01:54:14,570 --> 01:54:16,700
that oh,
I need to be doing something right now

2457
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:21,350
and that he needed to curb that and he
needed to just watch the waves.

2458
01:54:21,870 --> 01:54:23,060
Yeah.
That was it.

2459
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:27,470
Not think about.
And that's what I have is the problem I

2460
01:54:27,471 --> 01:54:30,710
have is I have a.
When you try to meditate,

2461
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:35,600
people have said there's a river of
20,000 thoughts that you get just

2462
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:38,450
nonstop.
And I've been waking up every single

2463
01:54:38,451 --> 01:54:40,580
night at 2:00 in the morning every
night,

2464
01:54:40,810 --> 01:54:42,380
almost.
Not every night,

2465
01:54:42,381 --> 01:54:44,690
but four or five nights a week.
Why

2466
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:51,830
different reasons to think about
thoughts just and then just thinking

2467
01:54:51,831 --> 01:54:53,890
about stuff nonstop.
Well,

2468
01:54:53,891 --> 01:54:56,930
let's just see what you're saying to me.
Two different contradictory things.

2469
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:01,130
You're saying that you want peace and
you want calm and then you're saying you

2470
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:05,030
want to start running shows and then
you're saying you want to start having

2471
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:09,440
multiple careers.
I want to be able to work on coming into

2472
01:55:09,441 --> 01:55:11,090
town.
Do a gig,

2473
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:13,070
right?
You caN't be a show runner.

2474
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:18,130
Work on a thing for like you sAid,
the show that I'm on is 10 episodes and

2475
01:55:18,410 --> 01:55:22,940
we worked on that for five months and
then I wanted to do nothing else.

2476
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,070
Right.
But you know that when you work on a

2477
01:55:25,071 --> 01:55:27,170
show,
you're working 16 hour days.

2478
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:30,560
Like if you want to be a show runner for
a successful show that the amount of

2479
01:55:30,561 --> 01:55:34,530
time that's required to actually make
something take off sure was massive.

2480
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:37,910
We you have to manage a bunch of
different people and expectations and.

2481
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:41,180
but it's a.
It's a portion of your year,

2482
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:45,180
so it'd be like working seasonal work
almost secret.

2483
01:55:45,181 --> 01:55:47,190
You just.
That's It for me.

2484
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:52,191
That's the ideal version.
Has to act on a show that has a episode

2485
01:55:53,551 --> 01:55:58,200
order and then go back to santa barbara
and then do nothing,

2486
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:03,590
saw a bad idea and then come back and be
able to just control your own work is

2487
01:56:04,321 --> 01:56:08,670
really what I want to do.
You need to financial freedom to be able

2488
01:56:08,671 --> 01:56:12,390
to do that and then those shows pay
really well.

2489
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,180
So I'm just trying to map out and I
don't have the answer.

2490
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:17,520
I'm thinking,
and this is certainly not something I'm

2491
01:56:17,521 --> 01:56:19,410
doing right now,
but again,

2492
01:56:19,411 --> 01:56:23,850
when you work seasonally and then you
can really take some time to just hang

2493
01:56:23,851 --> 01:56:28,230
out and read on a deck and make dinner
and that's your go shop for an

2494
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:31,830
individual meal every day.
Go and fish and do shit like that.

2495
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:34,890
yeah.
You seem like you're longing for this.

2496
01:56:34,891 --> 01:56:39,891
I'm idealistic view of peace and quiet
while pursuing chaos.

2497
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:43,600
Yeah,
they're very contradictory.

2498
01:56:43,601 --> 01:56:44,520
You understand what I'm saying?

2499
01:56:44,710 --> 01:56:47,570
Totally will.
ThiS is something that I promised myself

2500
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:51,260
I was going to bust my ass until I was
50 and I'm 48.

2501
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:56,261
I'm about to turn 46 and then just take
it as it comes when realistically as she

2502
01:56:57,121 --> 01:57:01,250
just take it as it comes right now and
not now.

2503
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:03,310
I hustle really hard.
You know?

2504
01:57:03,311 --> 01:57:05,670
I have 10 things going on.

2505
01:57:06,250 --> 01:57:08,260
Yeah.
It's a weird balancing act trying to

2506
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:10,300
figure out,
figure out how to manage your life for

2507
01:57:10,301 --> 01:57:15,301
ultimate happiness and then sometimes
like that the real ultimate happiness

2508
01:57:15,611 --> 01:57:20,611
comes after you've had struggle.
Like you only really appreciate sunlight

2509
01:57:20,771 --> 01:57:23,030
if you get a lot of rain,
like we don't have.

2510
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:28,120
Like I went to prince of wales island in
Alaska for six days once and we were up

2511
01:57:28,121 --> 01:57:30,940
there camping.
It's fuckiNg miserable pouring rain

2512
01:57:30,941 --> 01:57:33,690
every day.
But when I came back to la,

2513
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,530
God damn,
I was happy.

2514
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:39,790
The sunlight felt so good.
I mean it felt like the sunlight's out

2515
01:57:39,791 --> 01:57:41,710
there right now.
It doesn't feel like shit.

2516
01:57:41,711 --> 01:57:42,560
I get mY car,
god,

2517
01:57:42,561 --> 01:57:43,900
it's hot.
I drive off.

2518
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:47,230
I don't appreciate it,
but when I came back from Alaska I

2519
01:57:47,231 --> 01:57:51,970
really fucking appreciate it and I feel
like some amount of the peace and quiet

2520
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:54,430
that we seek and we enjoy.
You're only gonna.

2521
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:57,120
Appreciate it.
If you struggle like you're only going

2522
01:57:57,121 --> 01:58:02,080
to appreciate like real relaxation feet
up out the beach if you've been busting

2523
01:58:02,081 --> 01:58:02,730
your ass.

2524
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:07,730
For me,
What I think a tremendous amount of calm

2525
01:58:08,071 --> 01:58:09,890
comes from is,
and this is,

2526
01:58:09,891 --> 01:58:13,500
I don't know,
you can tell me is just financial

2527
01:58:13,501 --> 01:58:15,570
freedom.
like I don't have a house payment

2528
01:58:15,571 --> 01:58:18,990
hanging over my head and I don't have
all this stuff that I'm just worried

2529
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:23,760
about and I,
I tend to worry a lot about that stuff.

2530
01:58:23,761 --> 01:58:26,910
That's why I worked my ass off.
Like I really want to just.

2531
01:58:26,911 --> 01:58:30,870
And I'm over complicating my life,
but I am and,

2532
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,370
and david really big.
You see me?

2533
01:58:32,410 --> 01:58:33,960
I'm Like,
I'm a happy guy,

2534
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:37,590
but I just,
when we waken up in the middle of the

2535
01:58:37,591 --> 01:58:39,930
night at 2:00 in the morning thinking
about all the shit that you have to do,

2536
01:58:39,931 --> 01:58:41,740
you had to pare some stuff.
Yeah,

2537
01:58:41,741 --> 01:58:45,040
there's that for sure.
When you're a financially free,

2538
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:49,480
it removes a gigantic burden.
I remember my first development deal.

2539
01:58:49,481 --> 01:58:52,540
That was the first thing I felt.
I got a development deal way back in the

2540
01:58:52,541 --> 01:58:54,400
nineties and the first thing that
happened,

2541
01:58:54,401 --> 01:58:58,180
they sent me thIs big fat check and all
of a sudden I felt lighter.

2542
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:59,320
Like,
like something.

2543
01:58:59,321 --> 01:59:01,540
Like I took a backpack off,
filled with rocks.

2544
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:05,200
Like ugh.
Now I knew that I could paY my bills for

2545
01:59:05,201 --> 01:59:08,380
the foreseeable future.
I was going to be able to pay my bills

2546
01:59:08,381 --> 01:59:11,170
for the next,
like more than a year if I wanted to do

2547
01:59:11,171 --> 01:59:13,390
nothing,
sit back for a year and live the way I'm

2548
01:59:13,391 --> 01:59:15,130
living,
I'd have no problem paying my bills.

2549
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:19,420
And uh,
it was a very tangible feeling like,

2550
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,850
okay,
now that I have this momentum,

2551
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:24,400
I've got to keep this going because I
don't ever want to go back to that

2552
01:59:24,401 --> 01:59:28,690
feeling of not being able to pay my
bills because that's the real struggle.

2553
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:31,510
The real struggle is like financial
independence.

2554
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:35,410
Once You become financially independent,
then there's levels to it,

2555
01:59:35,450 --> 01:59:36,700
you know,
like you want to have one of those

2556
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:40,210
monosito houses or have a fucking
private jet or you want to get crazier

2557
01:59:40,211 --> 01:59:42,610
and crazier and crazier.
You're just so overly confident.

2558
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:46,850
That's like the assistant thing.
Exactly.

2559
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:50,450
That's kind of.
So I feel like this level right here.

2560
01:59:50,451 --> 01:59:53,390
So I'm living in the house that I want
to live in.

2561
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:57,080
I'm not,
I'm never moving and we're good to,

2562
01:59:57,081 --> 02:00:00,490
in terms of the la sort of raising my
kids house like a,

2563
02:00:00,620 --> 02:00:02,900
we're in a great little place.
I love it.

2564
02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:07,040
I live in pasadena second.
There's the wildlife in your yard.

2565
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:08,660
You send me pictures of deer in your
yard.

2566
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:10,400
Exactly.
There's deer,

2567
02:00:10,730 --> 02:00:14,840
coyotes,
bobcats jumped out behind me the other

2568
02:00:14,841 --> 02:00:15,770
day.
Jesus.

2569
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:17,720
Yeah.
It was running as bears and in the past

2570
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:21,390
dean happened to people's pools only in
the black neighborhooD.

2571
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:25,250
So yes.
Black bears too weird.

2572
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:27,770
It totally.
And so what they.

2573
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:29,730
I'm,
I'm,

2574
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:31,160
I'm cool.
I don't want,

2575
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:33,950
I don't need to fly private.
I don't need to.

2576
02:00:33,951 --> 02:00:36,560
I'm sure that's nice.
I have no aspirations.

2577
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:39,380
I again,
I just want to live comfortably,

2578
02:00:39,381 --> 02:00:44,381
but once you fly in first class,
it's difficult to go sit by the bathroom

2579
02:00:44,721 --> 02:00:46,840
in between two other people like,
you know,

2580
02:00:46,850 --> 02:00:50,480
so there's certain luxuries that I want
to be able to afford.

2581
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:54,200
But again,
I just want to chill out,

2582
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:57,300
hang out in the backyard and have a
drink with my wife and fucking have

2583
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:59,750
people over and barbecue.
That's it.

2584
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:03,170
That's all after you totally do that.
That's,

2585
02:01:03,171 --> 02:01:05,000
that's very peaceful and that's a great
tHing.

2586
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:09,710
And then also getting satisfaction out
of creating stuff and making stuff and

2587
02:01:09,711 --> 02:01:14,300
working at the same time.
And even if it's shit that I'm this guy

2588
02:01:14,301 --> 02:01:18,320
that I bought this house from the left
knee as table saw and all a bunch of

2589
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:21,680
wood
furniture.

2590
02:01:21,710 --> 02:01:23,210
What are you doing?
Are you making furniture?

2591
02:01:23,211 --> 02:01:25,190
I'm not doing anything with it.
Are you thinking about doing something

2592
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:26,380
like thinking about like,
I got,

2593
02:01:26,410 --> 02:01:28,670
use this stuff.
We know how to use a table.

2594
02:01:28,671 --> 02:01:29,430
Saw.
No,

2595
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:31,040
we'll learn.
Don't cut your fucking face.

2596
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:32,133
Never know.

2597
02:01:34,730 --> 02:01:35,570
Sure.

2598
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:39,600
Now I'm gonna make.
Um,

2599
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,350
he left like a,
some birdhouse stuff there.

2600
02:01:42,351 --> 02:01:46,750
I've just wanted to be the old man that
like tinkers and makes shelves and stuff

2601
02:01:46,751 --> 02:01:48,570
like that for people.
And uh,

2602
02:01:48,970 --> 02:01:49,690
my,
my,

2603
02:01:49,690 --> 02:01:54,180
my dad was an artist and my uncle john
is an artist and um,

2604
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:57,230
you know,
put together the sculptures with all

2605
02:01:57,231 --> 02:01:59,570
wood and he was like a very skilled
carpenter.

2606
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:04,630
So I always like looked at those guys
thinking I gotta do this shit.

2607
02:02:04,830 --> 02:02:06,020
Then I just want to like,
yeah,

2608
02:02:06,230 --> 02:02:07,820
there's a bunch of shit I like to do
like that.

2609
02:02:07,821 --> 02:02:10,280
Like I want to tinker,
I want to fly fish.

2610
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,990
Fly fishing is fun.
See,

2611
02:02:12,350 --> 02:02:16,310
I used to fly fish a lot.
There's a casting thing in the arroyo in

2612
02:02:16,311 --> 02:02:20,150
pasadena where there's a big arroyo
casting club.

2613
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:23,600
Was all these old men just practicing.
Where do they fly fishing.

2614
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:25,790
Pasadena's needs.
Is there a river there now?

2615
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:28,580
There's a whole place where it's like
they've,

2616
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:33,920
it's just a body of water where they
made me like a little pond.

2617
02:02:33,921 --> 02:02:35,930
Yeah.
so then they go out,

2618
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:38,430
they take trips to places that I'll go
out and go to,

2619
02:02:38,431 --> 02:02:41,780
go to sierra and I was in bozeman this
center this summer,

2620
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:42,710
bozeman,
Montana.

2621
02:02:42,711 --> 02:02:43,280
And we,
uh,

2622
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:46,070
we went by this,
a place where all these people were fly

2623
02:02:46,071 --> 02:02:48,560
fishing and then maybe so excited.
I'm like,

2624
02:02:48,561 --> 02:02:49,730
god,
I want to go back and do that.

2625
02:02:49,731 --> 02:02:53,660
But it was weird because they catch and
release and I was like,

2626
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:55,970
okay,
now you're weirding me out because

2627
02:02:55,971 --> 02:02:57,680
you're just putting a hole in that
fish's face.

2628
02:02:57,740 --> 02:03:00,120
Then you'll let them back.
Like this is kind of fucked up.

2629
02:03:00,121 --> 02:03:03,080
My buddy,
a daily show guy just went to Russia to

2630
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:05,690
go fly fishing.
He's super into it and they bought a

2631
02:03:05,691 --> 02:03:08,420
place in upstate New York that has a
river right by it.

2632
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:11,170
And just time,
that's because up for,

2633
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:14,300
well,
if you can do like a place where you can

2634
02:03:14,301 --> 02:03:17,360
catch the fish and eat it.
God damn on the shore if you have a

2635
02:03:17,361 --> 02:03:20,700
little cast iron frying pan,
make little campfire and have some shore

2636
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:23,540
lunch.
Oh so delicious for me.

2637
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:28,460
That is the sort of ultimate hanGing out
with my wife having a glass of wine,

2638
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:31,400
doing that.
reading and then going to bed.

2639
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:35,510
But yOu really want to do it or do you
like the romantic idea of doing it?

2640
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:39,440
We're going to fucking find out.
But right now it's just the romantic

2641
02:03:39,450 --> 02:03:40,520
ideal.
Totally.

2642
02:03:40,521 --> 02:03:41,720
Yeah.
But I do like going,

2643
02:03:41,721 --> 02:03:43,580
we've gone away in a couple of times,
like um,

2644
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:47,360
my kids are just at the point where they
went away for a sleepover and this only

2645
02:03:47,361 --> 02:03:52,361
happened one time and me and my wife
drove up into altadena and heard about

2646
02:03:53,631 --> 02:03:55,610
this hike that people do and took the
dogs,

2647
02:03:55,611 --> 02:03:57,440
went on this hike and we had a blast.

2648
02:03:57,530 --> 02:04:02,530
And I know that if I could mix it in a
proper amount of work and the proper

2649
02:04:02,931 --> 02:04:05,120
amount of just chilling out,
I'll love it.

2650
02:04:05,121 --> 02:04:08,000
I have three hammocks in my backyarD
that I don't use.

2651
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:09,340
I barely lanD them.
Yeah.

2652
02:04:09,341 --> 02:04:10,640
See,
this is what I'm getting out of you.

2653
02:04:10,850 --> 02:04:14,420
I'm getting that you're,
you're thinking about like this romantic

2654
02:04:14,421 --> 02:04:19,421
idea of relaxation and peace and quiet,
but look at our constantly vacation

2655
02:04:19,911 --> 02:04:22,250
homes non,
but meanwhile you're also planning on

2656
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:26,810
doing a bunch of shows and being an
executive producer and a show runner and

2657
02:04:26,811 --> 02:04:30,710
a writer and a standup performer and
you're actinG and.

2658
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:32,840
Yeah,
I've got a ton of shit going on and

2659
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:37,800
you're yelling at people yelling
necessarily talking about eventually

2660
02:04:37,801 --> 02:04:38,100
getting

2661
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,880
to a cognitive therapist and potentially
starting meditation.

2662
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:43,860
It's like you have this.
I just do it noW.

2663
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:44,491
Yeah,
well,

2664
02:04:44,491 --> 02:04:45,330
yeah,
for sure.

2665
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:46,620
Yeah.
You should have already done it like

2666
02:04:46,621 --> 02:04:47,060
you,
you,

2667
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:48,570
you,
all these things you should should've

2668
02:04:48,571 --> 02:04:50,800
already done.
So this is the problem with me.

2669
02:04:50,801 --> 02:04:51,960
He's money.
Okay.

2670
02:04:51,961 --> 02:04:55,830
So the atc I don't do for anyone.
I have nothing but money in.

2671
02:04:55,831 --> 02:04:58,860
So that's not about money at all.
So that's starting like I started my

2672
02:04:58,861 --> 02:05:02,070
standup career eventually.
That'll be great.

2673
02:05:02,770 --> 02:05:03,603
No.
Well,

2674
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:06,690
it takes a lot of work,
but that's just what is the idea behind

2675
02:05:06,691 --> 02:05:07,500
it?
Okay.

2676
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:12,500
So we things comedy by the way.
So this is all things comedy is me and

2677
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:17,700
bill came up with the idea that
comedians should own and distribute all

2678
02:05:17,701 --> 02:05:20,910
of their own content.
When I first showed up in la,

2679
02:05:22,630 --> 02:05:25,830
worked on tv.
So cheech from cheech and chong who told

2680
02:05:25,831 --> 02:05:29,640
me to do two things,
it would be nice to every single person

2681
02:05:29,641 --> 02:05:31,640
you meet out in the public,
uh,

2682
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:34,590
every busboy is going to have the
teacher's an asshole story if you're

2683
02:05:34,591 --> 02:05:34,950
addicted.

2684
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:37,140
Anybody.
So try to be as nice to as many people

2685
02:05:37,141 --> 02:05:39,420
as you can.
And then he goes,

2686
02:05:39,421 --> 02:05:42,300
also,
you want to own every single piece of

2687
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:45,600
content you ever put out there because.
And he goes,

2688
02:05:45,601 --> 02:05:47,880
I owned all the movies and I owned all
the albums.

2689
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:53,390
So every single day is all this mailbox
money and now we get put as comedians,

2690
02:05:54,001 --> 02:05:57,270
restarting I everybody starting all
these podcasts and this is 2010.

2691
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:02,070
So we do all the paperwork,
we finally get the company and we take a

2692
02:06:02,071 --> 02:06:04,620
big chunk of the company.
And we say,

2693
02:06:04,621 --> 02:06:07,710
okay,
everyone that participates in this

2694
02:06:07,711 --> 02:06:09,480
network,
this is the board of directors,

2695
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:10,713
thompson,
agora,

2696
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:12,413
bert,
kreischer,

2697
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,370
ari shaffir,
dave anthony,

2698
02:06:14,430 --> 02:06:15,420
myself,
bill burr,

2699
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:20,400
and we help guide this place in the
right direction.

2700
02:06:20,401 --> 02:06:23,480
So when new comic wants to come on,
all of us sort of go,

2701
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:24,900
do we want this person on?

2702
02:06:25,350 --> 02:06:27,900
For example,
john repin and tiana are going to start

2703
02:06:27,901 --> 02:06:31,920
a podcast.
I approached John Reed called me and I

2704
02:06:31,921 --> 02:06:34,550
talked to sarah and put them together.
Felipe esparza,

2705
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:37,620
uh,
saw that no latinos are doing podcasts.

2706
02:06:37,621 --> 02:06:41,430
I know philippe's fucking hilarious.
And instead of like being all like to

2707
02:06:41,431 --> 02:06:43,530
the other latino comedians,
all competitive,

2708
02:06:43,580 --> 02:06:45,780
it's like fleabag,
you got to do fucking podcast.

2709
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:48,660
And he started one called what's up?
Fool does great,

2710
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:52,260
and it's helped out as numbers and
everything like that.

2711
02:06:52,261 --> 02:06:57,090
So we all collectively owned this
company together that distributes our

2712
02:06:57,091 --> 02:06:59,700
content.
So in this content starts with podcasts

2713
02:06:59,701 --> 02:07:01,500
would then eventually we started our own
studio.

2714
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:07,160
We are redoing our website right now.
We're going to start selling our own tv

2715
02:07:07,441 --> 02:07:11,130
shows.
Burt did a cooking show called

2716
02:07:11,131 --> 02:07:12,490
something's burning.
Why?

2717
02:07:12,491 --> 02:07:17,070
It's fucking a tom.
And bill watching to most unsanitary

2718
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:21,630
ever seen him play with his nose
touching is no,

2719
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:25,100
quit fucking touch your nose one more
time.

2720
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:27,920
I'm not going to eat any of that shit.
No one's going to eat that shit.

2721
02:07:28,270 --> 02:07:31,760
And they're fucking yelling at each
other while they're cooking and bert and

2722
02:07:31,761 --> 02:07:34,220
just dumped a bunch of oil down the sing
can.

2723
02:07:34,450 --> 02:07:39,450
Yeah.
You were making that and we shot for an

2724
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:42,280
hour and tom and bill were hunched over
laughing.

2725
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:45,970
I was in the back just cracking up
because he couldn't believe what I was

2726
02:07:45,971 --> 02:07:48,220
watching.
But what are you doing with it?

2727
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:51,670
That should be a show.
Is it on anything right now?

2728
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:56,700
So it's going to be on abc.com or we're
going to sell it as an individual.

2729
02:07:56,820 --> 02:07:58,120
You did it a long time ago?
No,

2730
02:07:58,121 --> 02:07:59,740
we just shot.
It was distance three.

2731
02:07:59,741 --> 02:08:00,820
Couple of months ago.
Weeks ago?

2732
02:08:00,821 --> 02:08:01,720
yeah.
Two weeks ago.

2733
02:08:01,721 --> 02:08:02,710
Three weeks.
Not two weeks.

2734
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:03,790
Three,
four weeks ago.

2735
02:08:04,450 --> 02:08:07,000
And just haven't edited it or editing it
right now.

2736
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:08,890
They're just putting it together.
So do you have like a,

2737
02:08:08,910 --> 02:08:12,310
a group of editors and stuff?
So we partner with this company called

2738
02:08:12,311 --> 02:08:15,460
soapbox films that has 15 editors,
animators,

2739
02:08:15,461 --> 02:08:18,730
all these people on staff.
So when you come by you'll see that we

2740
02:08:18,731 --> 02:08:21,280
have two full stages.
We have a green screen,

2741
02:08:21,281 --> 02:08:24,130
white cyc,
if color corrections,

2742
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:28,090
you know,
a sound mixing studios.

2743
02:08:28,091 --> 02:08:33,091
And then they gave us our podcast studio
to different offices and then other

2744
02:08:34,151 --> 02:08:37,210
meeting rooms as part of like an
investment in us.

2745
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:39,430
Wow.
So anyway,

2746
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:43,030
but everybody owns everything.
We have atc records that again,

2747
02:08:43,031 --> 02:08:45,970
I haven't had the time.
We're just staffing up right now because

2748
02:08:45,971 --> 02:08:49,420
we took on a little bit of money.
But you took on money.

2749
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:50,520
You know,
we've got an investor's.

2750
02:08:50,521 --> 02:08:51,480
Yeah,
we got investors.

2751
02:08:52,250 --> 02:08:55,360
Did somebody get out and given us a
million bucks?

2752
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:56,583
Jesus.
yeah.

2753
02:08:56,770 --> 02:09:00,490
So the idea behind it is you're kind of
acting as a network.

2754
02:09:00,550 --> 02:09:02,290
We're going to turn into our own
network.

2755
02:09:02,291 --> 02:09:07,291
It's going to be like united artists and
when shows sell,

2756
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:11,710
it's going to be full transparency.
When let's say something's burning goes

2757
02:09:11,711 --> 02:09:16,711
up and people start buying it.
Burt just gonna look at his back end and

2758
02:09:17,531 --> 02:09:19,000
know exactly.
You know,

2759
02:09:19,001 --> 02:09:21,520
the money has to be recouped and then
you know,

2760
02:09:22,210 --> 02:09:24,370
the money is split.
Interesting.

2761
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,710
He'll just get access.
Like burt will own that if there's,

2762
02:09:26,711 --> 02:09:31,711
if there's a tv show that gets made out
of that and it becomes popular and then

2763
02:09:32,441 --> 02:09:35,430
there's the idea behind it that there's
strength in numbers and yeah,

2764
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:37,510
we all,
we all really help each other out too.

2765
02:09:37,511 --> 02:09:38,800
Like if I'm,
for example,

2766
02:09:38,801 --> 02:09:42,280
I got this special coming out and
everyone's going to help me get behind

2767
02:09:42,281 --> 02:09:42,370
it.

2768
02:09:42,370 --> 02:09:44,420
When burt special comes out,
everybody says,

2769
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:45,730
you know,
goes crazy.

2770
02:09:45,740 --> 02:09:47,050
We sort of do that.
Anyway.

2771
02:09:47,051 --> 02:09:47,860
We all do that.
Anyway,

2772
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:50,140
that's the collection.
This is like,

2773
02:09:50,141 --> 02:09:55,141
um,
this is an association of comics working

2774
02:09:56,621 --> 02:10:00,220
together to promote each other.
And so like if you guys have a podcast

2775
02:10:00,221 --> 02:10:02,650
on the all things comedy label,
everyone knows,

2776
02:10:02,651 --> 02:10:06,610
well this is going to be pretty high
quality because comedians are going to

2777
02:10:06,611 --> 02:10:09,340
be a better show.
We're going to reign that in a little

2778
02:10:09,341 --> 02:10:13,270
bit like you said,
but for the most part we have a lot of

2779
02:10:13,271 --> 02:10:17,080
people contacting us and it's all
community of our peers.

2780
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:20,530
We all really like and really enjoying
that or is that bringing you extra

2781
02:10:20,531 --> 02:10:22,720
stress?
It brings you a little extra stress

2782
02:10:22,721 --> 02:10:25,390
because they've put some money in.
It's definitely something I'm looking

2783
02:10:25,391 --> 02:10:28,300
at.
I'm getting to a point and empowering

2784
02:10:28,301 --> 02:10:32,590
other people that have some other comics
coming into help me work on creative

2785
02:10:32,591 --> 02:10:34,160
stuff.
But is it making money

2786
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:35,620
or is it.
Oh yeah.

2787
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:37,490
So we just um,
you know,

2788
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:39,500
we haven't put out any of our tv shows
yet.

2789
02:10:39,501 --> 02:10:41,420
I mean I hope to have tv shows on the
air.

2790
02:10:41,421 --> 02:10:44,960
Let's just like funny or die makes money
off of unbranded.

2791
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:50,920
I got to have companies come to us and
want scripts written and I was able to

2792
02:10:51,471 --> 02:10:56,471
give gigs to guys I knew on a daily show
where they get paid like $45,000 to

2793
02:10:56,871 --> 02:11:00,800
write a script for a corporation.
Oh wow.

2794
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:04,700
And all those times you get gigs,
like we can serve as the agency for

2795
02:11:04,701 --> 02:11:05,780
that.
We can do,

2796
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:10,870
I can match tom papa up with a company
so he can write their ad copy just to

2797
02:11:12,411 --> 02:11:17,411
bring him extra side money.
Like we can do branded content

2798
02:11:17,601 --> 02:11:19,280
integrated marketing.
And all that shit.

2799
02:11:19,281 --> 02:11:21,270
And have the comedians on the company
that does that.

2800
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:23,840
Comedians are responsible for so much
fucking content.

2801
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:26,090
It's books,
it's tv shows,

2802
02:11:26,091 --> 02:11:28,220
it's movies.
It's just like you're thinking about all

2803
02:11:28,221 --> 02:11:31,520
these comics are producing so much great
shit.

2804
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,280
Then why shouldn't all the comics have a
company that distributes on it?

2805
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:38,340
Well,
it's interesting because there's a bunch

2806
02:11:38,341 --> 02:11:40,620
of groups that are coming along right
now that are trying to capitalize on

2807
02:11:40,621 --> 02:11:42,210
podcasting.
And one of the things that's

2808
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:45,540
fascinating.
I had a conversation with a friend of

2809
02:11:45,541 --> 02:11:50,541
ours who's got a podcast and his agency
or his management company that suck now

2810
02:11:51,481 --> 02:11:53,730
are telling him they want a piece of the
podcast,

2811
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:56,460
fuck you.
And for the longest time they were

2812
02:11:56,461 --> 02:12:00,090
telling him he was wasting his time
doing a podcast and they were saying you

2813
02:12:00,091 --> 02:12:03,690
need to worry about like put,
getting a scripted show getting of this

2814
02:12:03,691 --> 02:12:05,040
and a dad.
And he was like,

2815
02:12:05,041 --> 02:12:07,560
I really think that there's something in
podcasts.

2816
02:12:07,650 --> 02:12:11,310
So they.
They were negative and they were

2817
02:12:11,311 --> 02:12:15,720
criticizing his efforts and now they
want a piece of it and he's baffled and

2818
02:12:15,721 --> 02:12:16,650
he doesn't know what to do.
I'm like,

2819
02:12:16,651 --> 02:12:17,880
you got to leAve them.
no,

2820
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:19,980
you gotta leave them.
Absolutely not.

2821
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:22,110
They're not doing anything.
Before I even talk to me.

2822
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:24,780
I could have just a thursday.
No

2823
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:25,980
sense in you.
You're doing it.

2824
02:12:25,981 --> 02:12:30,981
It's like this is something just like
your standup career than you really

2825
02:12:31,351 --> 02:12:33,120
don't.
Now because of the technology,

2826
02:12:33,121 --> 02:12:37,110
you don't need an intro to the
establishment.

2827
02:12:37,111 --> 02:12:40,530
When you're a young standup comedian,
you need a management manager and an

2828
02:12:40,531 --> 02:12:45,531
agent to usher you into the established
group of decision makers.

2829
02:12:48,030 --> 02:12:50,220
Right?
when you're a podcaster and you're

2830
02:12:50,221 --> 02:12:54,450
podcast becomes popular,
it's you and a room and that microphone

2831
02:12:54,451 --> 02:12:57,360
and people did listen and there's
really.

2832
02:12:57,361 --> 02:12:59,130
Because you're putting out a good
product,

2833
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:04,140
you don't need somebody to tell you like
it's okay to do it or you're going to be

2834
02:13:04,141 --> 02:13:07,620
on this network like that's.
It doesn't matter.

2835
02:13:07,650 --> 02:13:10,860
You can do it by yourself and that's
another thing that I encourage all

2836
02:13:10,861 --> 02:13:13,820
people to do and this is a why am able
to like,

2837
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:17,250
even though I am stressed out,
I wake up in the middle of the night,

2838
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:19,570
I usually,
there's a lot of contradictory shit

2839
02:13:19,590 --> 02:13:21,660
going on and I'm looking at vacation
homes.

2840
02:13:22,050 --> 02:13:25,860
I love it.
I fucking love doing what I'm doing.

2841
02:13:25,950 --> 02:13:27,540
I really do.
It was great.

2842
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:30,150
I love doing standup below the acting
like I just,

2843
02:13:30,151 --> 02:13:33,420
I love it all.
And to follow your bliss,

2844
02:13:33,421 --> 02:13:34,560
you know,
and to really,

2845
02:13:34,561 --> 02:13:37,650
I was fIring people and like you said,
do you have to be up In the rain to

2846
02:13:37,651 --> 02:13:41,190
appreciate the sunshine sake?
That's where I was when I was working

2847
02:13:41,191 --> 02:13:43,170
for somebody else,
even though that somebody else was my

2848
02:13:43,171 --> 02:13:47,280
parents and so I got down into standup.
I'm like dry,

2849
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:49,320
look at all this great shit.
I looked right.

2850
02:13:49,321 --> 02:13:51,300
Even writing jokes are free for tim
allen.

2851
02:13:51,301 --> 02:13:52,740
Like I didn't have to do that.
Like,

2852
02:13:53,210 --> 02:13:57,930
I love doing all this stuff and so I'm
really thrilled like the people that we

2853
02:13:57,931 --> 02:14:02,310
get to associate with and the people we
get to meet and what happens when you do

2854
02:14:02,311 --> 02:14:04,650
something you love,
It all just sort of comes together.

2855
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:10,040
So I feel very fortunate that way that I
get to do all this shit and even though

2856
02:14:10,081 --> 02:14:12,630
I need to say no,
I need to pare it down.

2857
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:14,060
I'm still having a hard time.

2858
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:15,580
Well it's good that you're having a
blast,

2859
02:14:15,581 --> 02:14:18,490
but uh,
my advice to you is just do all those

2860
02:14:18,491 --> 02:14:21,070
things that you're talking about,
like especially do all those things as

2861
02:14:21,071 --> 02:14:23,310
far as like meditation,
do all those things,

2862
02:14:23,311 --> 02:14:26,230
like whatever the cognitive therapy
issue that you have to deal with.

2863
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:27,400
Just go do that.
Yeah.

2864
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:29,410
because you,
you talk about it too much.

2865
02:14:29,530 --> 02:14:30,520
I know.
Yeah.

2866
02:14:30,521 --> 02:14:34,380
Like you and I have had like 30
conversations about your temper,

2867
02:14:34,780 --> 02:14:36,850
you know,
over like 10 years.

2868
02:14:37,290 --> 02:14:42,290
Like that's crazy and nothing's changed.
It's less because she got more and more

2869
02:14:45,281 --> 02:14:46,120
aware of it.
Right.

2870
02:14:46,121 --> 02:14:47,470
I'm totally aware of.
Right.

2871
02:14:47,930 --> 02:14:50,050
Yeah.
I've been so cool.

2872
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:55,300
There has not been an incident in a
while except another night with steve

2873
02:14:55,301 --> 02:14:56,200
up.
Well,

2874
02:14:56,201 --> 02:14:59,950
that was a long time ago.
That was the other night we were talking

2875
02:14:59,951 --> 02:15:01,600
about the person that cut into applause
break.

2876
02:15:02,410 --> 02:15:07,360
Oh yeah.
Last week.

2877
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:12,340
But it was just fucking reba
and again also,

2878
02:15:12,341 --> 02:15:13,210
you know,
it for a long time.

2879
02:15:13,211 --> 02:15:16,780
I'm not a in sync.
It gets also you caring about comedy.

2880
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:17,680
It's terrible.

2881
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:21,410
Really caring too much about comedy.
It's me being again,

2882
02:15:21,740 --> 02:15:26,450
sacrificing a lot to do what I'm doing
and then seeing other people are just

2883
02:15:26,451 --> 02:15:29,330
trying to fucking take advantage,
you know?

2884
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:32,160
Yeah.
Like I love the idea of all things

2885
02:15:32,161 --> 02:15:33,040
comedy,
um,

2886
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:34,980
but I don't want to do anything like
that myself,

2887
02:15:34,990 --> 02:15:36,150
which seems to me like,
god,

2888
02:15:36,151 --> 02:15:38,940
you're invested in yourself in a whole
bunch of other people's problems.

2889
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:42,120
You know,
what I've kind of done is form a network

2890
02:15:42,121 --> 02:15:45,570
without having an actual network or all
the people that I'm friends with,

2891
02:15:45,571 --> 02:15:50,100
whether it's tom or joey or duncan,
I helped them.

2892
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:55,210
I promote them just by just doing it.
I don't want any connection on.

2893
02:15:55,370 --> 02:15:57,600
I don't want any financial connection to
it.

2894
02:15:57,740 --> 02:15:59,210
You know,
I don't even have a fucking contract.

2895
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:02,620
My manager,
we've been together for so long like I

2896
02:16:02,621 --> 02:16:05,430
don't either.
Our contract came up and I go,

2897
02:16:05,431 --> 02:16:07,380
I don't need a contract.
You need a contract.

2898
02:16:07,381 --> 02:16:08,214
He's like,
no.

2899
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:09,580
Well good.
shook hands.

2900
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:13,890
Gave him a hug so don't have to fucking
nonsense legal shit.

2901
02:16:13,891 --> 02:16:16,720
I'm never leaving him.
Been with him since I was an open mic or

2902
02:16:16,721 --> 02:16:17,840
I'm not.
I'm not going anywhere else.

2903
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:21,690
No,
and that's also when we shot that a

2904
02:16:22,170 --> 02:16:24,870
pretty,
I'd say read this bird thing again.

2905
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,580
There's no contract.
Beautiful.

2906
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:30,340
Shake hands again.
I would die

2907
02:16:30,670 --> 02:16:33,270
before I fucked anybody overlay.
I'm really would die.

2908
02:16:33,271 --> 02:16:37,000
And so there's no contracts with us.
It's like we're going to make to put

2909
02:16:37,001 --> 02:16:40,390
that out there,
whether it's for free or whatever,

2910
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:42,760
you know,
just we're going to start making shit.

2911
02:16:42,761 --> 02:16:44,380
And the most important thing is you're
having a good time.

2912
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:45,990
Have a great time.
That's awesome.

2913
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,960
Stover.
Laughing.

2914
02:16:46,961 --> 02:16:48,330
Couldn't stop.
Like.

2915
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:50,470
It's not like.
The best part about this whole thing is

2916
02:16:50,471 --> 02:16:52,300
that you get a chance to hang out with
comics,

2917
02:16:52,350 --> 02:16:55,630
get a chance to have a good time.
Just in the more you do that,

2918
02:16:55,690 --> 02:16:57,670
the better stuff you put out,
you know,

2919
02:16:57,820 --> 02:16:59,830
the more you're in that vibe in that
group,

2920
02:16:59,831 --> 02:17:01,460
but humans,
you know,

2921
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:04,210
just having a good time,
but you're putting out those good vibes,

2922
02:17:04,211 --> 02:17:07,150
you're getting them back,
everybody's producing good stuff.

2923
02:17:07,570 --> 02:17:10,120
Again,
I can't stress enough to people

2924
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:15,121
listening and just finding that thing
that you really liked to do and doing it

2925
02:17:16,690 --> 02:17:18,340
is so fucking important.

2926
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:21,070
I don't know what it is,
but if you really like something itching

2927
02:17:21,071 --> 02:17:22,990
at you because that's the thing with my
parents,

2928
02:17:22,991 --> 02:17:25,420
family business and even knowing I
wanted,

2929
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:30,480
I knew I wanted to be a standup comic
forever and it took me awhile to figure

2930
02:17:30,971 --> 02:17:33,820
it out and so that's why I come down
here and I'm racing around,

2931
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:36,760
like really trying to cram it all in or
whatever's behind it.

2932
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:40,600
But I just wish that's a regret.
I do have.

2933
02:17:40,601 --> 02:17:44,040
I just started earlier.
How old were you when you started

2934
02:17:44,050 --> 02:17:46,930
telling?
Tell you I was 21.

2935
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:51,010
That's one of those things though.
I mean robert schimmel started when he

2936
02:17:51,011 --> 02:17:53,470
was 36.
Start whenever you start.

2937
02:17:53,660 --> 02:17:54,450
Yeah.
No,

2938
02:17:54,450 --> 02:17:58,150
it doesn't matter.
I think oftentimes whatever extra life

2939
02:17:58,151 --> 02:18:02,500
that you have before you start,
it's probably going to help you was when

2940
02:18:02,501 --> 02:18:04,120
I started,
I was a baby,

2941
02:18:04,490 --> 02:18:06,130
you know,
I didn't know shit about life.

2942
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:08,560
Yeah.
When I did start I was doing sales and

2943
02:18:08,561 --> 02:18:11,110
shit.
Like that was cool and Met life,

2944
02:18:11,830 --> 02:18:13,450
met life.
you've hung out with life.

2945
02:18:13,980 --> 02:18:16,570
He'D been there.
You've got down to nitty gritty.

2946
02:18:16,900 --> 02:18:20,620
I went and essentially like a couple of
years out of high school I became a

2947
02:18:20,621 --> 02:18:21,850
comic,
you know,

2948
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:25,700
and I was out there doing the life.
I've never done anything but they have a

2949
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:29,560
bunch of shit along with it,
but if there was ever a question,

2950
02:18:29,561 --> 02:18:30,041
someone said,
oh,

2951
02:18:30,041 --> 02:18:32,170
you have to quit everything except one
thing.

2952
02:18:32,171 --> 02:18:33,170
What's it going to be?
I'm like,

2953
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:35,890
that's easy.
Stand up.

2954
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:37,670
Everything else can go fuck itself.
Yeah.

2955
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:38,710
Yeah.
without a doubt.

2956
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:40,660
For sure,
because that's the thing.

2957
02:18:40,661 --> 02:18:44,020
As a standup comic,
we just always have this,

2958
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:48,280
the skills to go out and earn a living
for all jay leno's faults.

2959
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:51,190
He danced with some pretty great stuff
about.

2960
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:56,190
There's a book called comic insights by
franklin and gi where he used to teach

2961
02:18:56,360 --> 02:18:58,930
at ucla and if you go through as
interviews with richard,

2962
02:18:58,931 --> 02:19:03,931
jenny and chris rock and jay leno and
jalen was says takes you seven years,

2963
02:19:05,350 --> 02:19:08,170
it's like a law degree,
takes you seven years to get your law

2964
02:19:08,171 --> 02:19:12,420
degree and then it takes you another
seven years to be a good lawyer and then

2965
02:19:12,430 --> 02:19:16,270
it takes you seven years to sort of
figure out who you are as a comic and

2966
02:19:16,271 --> 02:19:18,580
then another,
another seven years to be a great comic.

2967
02:19:18,581 --> 02:19:20,380
So around your 14,
15,

2968
02:19:20,381 --> 02:19:23,290
you really started hitting your stride
because you're great at it.

2969
02:19:23,291 --> 02:19:25,770
You're getting better at it.
And uh,

2970
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:29,720
to do that at around seven years he
goes,

2971
02:19:30,010 --> 02:19:32,700
started making a living.
You can start really,

2972
02:19:32,701 --> 02:19:37,040
you can quit your day job and really
start making a fine living for your

2973
02:19:37,041 --> 02:19:40,670
family because you're making a least
like 70 to 100 is a long time ago at 70

2974
02:19:40,671 --> 02:19:41,504
grand a year.

2975
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:42,800
Oh yeah.
Great.

2976
02:19:42,801 --> 02:19:44,540
Living just a,
you could live.

2977
02:19:45,020 --> 02:19:49,100
I'm going to a bunch of comics on the
road that just living in Indiana fucking

2978
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:53,780
house costs $180,000.
A couple of kids.

2979
02:19:53,930 --> 02:19:55,610
Yeah,
totally can be done.

2980
02:19:55,740 --> 02:19:58,970
Total question and it's certainly better
than doing something that you don't want

2981
02:19:58,971 --> 02:19:59,810
to do.
Exactly.

2982
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:01,580
For whatever.
You know the people that are listening

2983
02:20:01,581 --> 02:20:04,130
to this and they're like,
what is my thing?

2984
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:05,630
It's gotta be something,
man.

2985
02:20:05,650 --> 02:20:08,300
You've got to be something.
It might be making canoes one of those.

2986
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:11,330
What the fuck it is.
I was so miserable doing that family

2987
02:20:11,331 --> 02:20:13,940
business.
I started doing stained glass.

2988
02:20:14,210 --> 02:20:15,590
Stained glass is cool.
Yeah.

2989
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:18,880
My dad did it and then I started doing.
I was looking for things.

2990
02:20:18,881 --> 02:20:21,140
I volunteered with the big brothers,
big sisters.

2991
02:20:21,530 --> 02:20:26,530
I was just held there like really?
And this is again where I single and had

2992
02:20:26,661 --> 02:20:28,790
the extra time to do anything.

2993
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:32,780
Like this is what I'm out and I was just
looking for it and then I knew when if I

2994
02:20:32,781 --> 02:20:36,800
turned 30 and I didn't try stand up
because it always had been itching at me

2995
02:20:36,801 --> 02:20:38,630
and people always told me I should do
it.

2996
02:20:39,170 --> 02:20:41,180
Then I would never be able to live with
myself,

2997
02:20:41,310 --> 02:20:44,150
you know,
so I forced myself to do it and even

2998
02:20:44,151 --> 02:20:45,240
though it was sort of,
you know,

2999
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:48,560
uncomfortable,
well this life is like this weird quick

3000
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:51,110
blip and it seems long when you're
young,

3001
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:54,950
but as you get older now I'm pushing 50,
I'll be 50 this year.

3002
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:58,970
It just happens fast.
It happens very fast and if you're not

3003
02:20:58,971 --> 02:21:01,790
doing what you want to do,
it's not a fun time.

3004
02:21:02,030 --> 02:21:04,730
It's not a good feeling and you,
we all know that person.

3005
02:21:04,731 --> 02:21:07,790
We all know that one person that's not
doing what they want to do and it eats

3006
02:21:07,791 --> 02:21:11,600
away at them all the time instead of the
people that you know that are fulfilled,

3007
02:21:11,630 --> 02:21:14,480
that are doing things they enjoy and
they're working hard and they're

3008
02:21:14,481 --> 02:21:16,640
pushing,
but they get that good feeling out of

3009
02:21:16,641 --> 02:21:16,730
it.

3010
02:21:16,730 --> 02:21:18,320
They're actually pursuing what they
love.

3011
02:21:18,321 --> 02:21:20,480
They actually feel like they're making a
difference in their life.

3012
02:21:20,481 --> 02:21:24,560
They're actually creating something or,
or accomplishing something.

3013
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:26,150
That's what you want to do,
man.

3014
02:21:26,151 --> 02:21:29,270
that's the key to getting those good
brain chemicals,

3015
02:21:29,271 --> 02:21:32,120
those good feelings,
having good people in your life.

3016
02:21:32,121 --> 02:21:34,970
Having good friends,
being kind to people,

3017
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:39,380
enjoying your time in this life and then
doing that thing that is actually

3018
02:21:39,381 --> 02:21:41,270
interesting to your personality and your
mind.

3019
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:46,450
So important.
And I'm taking a step away from work.

3020
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:49,910
Again,
those deathbed lists.

3021
02:21:49,911 --> 02:21:51,710
You kind of look at these death bed.
I don't want to.

3022
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:53,053
No,
nope.

3023
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:55,610
Don't want to look at regret.
I get it.

3024
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:59,000
I get it.
I work hard.

3025
02:21:59,090 --> 02:22:02,210
I know what I'm doing.
I'm no perfect person by any stretch of

3026
02:22:02,211 --> 02:22:04,130
the imagination,
but I don't need to look at regret.

3027
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:05,151
I'm,
I'm,

3028
02:22:05,151 --> 02:22:08,300
I'm focused on tHat all the time.
I'm trying to focus on positive things.

3029
02:22:08,301 --> 02:22:10,670
I am absolutely aware of the
consequences.

3030
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:11,601
You know,
I've,

3031
02:22:11,601 --> 02:22:13,340
I've,
I've contemplated it enough.

3032
02:22:13,341 --> 02:22:16,070
It's just not.
I think you could spend enough time

3033
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:20,480
focusing on negative shit like what
people should have done and it can fuck

3034
02:22:20,481 --> 02:22:23,090
with your head.
You don't want to look up when I'm

3035
02:22:23,091 --> 02:22:25,740
Seventy and go where?
I

3036
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,210
don't know.
You won't,

3037
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:30,990
you won't.
I'm not gonna iF I died tomorrow,

3038
02:22:30,991 --> 02:22:32,820
wouldn't.
I'm good.

3039
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:35,580
You just kinda keep going.
You just gotta keep enjoying it.

3040
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:37,530
You know?
And who knows what this thing really

3041
02:22:37,531 --> 02:22:40,200
even is so weirdest thing about this
life.

3042
02:22:40,230 --> 02:22:41,550
It's like what?
What is it?

3043
02:22:41,830 --> 02:22:42,870
I mean we,
we,

3044
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:47,900
we look at it in terms of this like a
sort of solidified structure of waking

3045
02:22:48,241 --> 02:22:50,910
up with the alarm clock,
getting your car driving to work.

3046
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:52,800
Meanwhile the entire time this is going
on,

3047
02:22:52,801 --> 02:22:57,450
you're a finite life form on a planet in
an infinite universe.

3048
02:22:57,451 --> 02:23:00,540
I mean all of it is preposterous from
the beginning to the end.

3049
02:23:00,570 --> 02:23:04,290
All of it's ridiculous and the more you
look into it and the more you really

3050
02:23:04,291 --> 02:23:09,291
contemplate the absolute,
just massive scale of this universe that

3051
02:23:11,851 --> 02:23:14,680
we live in,
the more it seems ridiculous and the,

3052
02:23:14,681 --> 02:23:18,030
the little things that are keeping you
up at night and waking up at 2:00 in the

3053
02:23:18,031 --> 02:23:20,460
morning,
the ame zion insurance,

3054
02:23:20,461 --> 02:23:21,294
ridiculous.

3055
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:22,590
It's ridiculous.
Shit.

3056
02:23:22,650 --> 02:23:25,020
Ridiculous shit.
Just a matter of perspective.

3057
02:23:25,170 --> 02:23:27,300
But I think it's also a matter of the
human body.

3058
02:23:27,610 --> 02:23:30,720
I think the human body is designed to
have a certain amount of stress.

3059
02:23:30,721 --> 02:23:33,840
You certain amount of worries.
The reason why we survived is because we

3060
02:23:33,850 --> 02:23:36,630
worried about predators are invaders and
all these different things.

3061
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:40,390
Those things don't exist anymore,
so we give ourselves issues,

3062
02:23:40,710 --> 02:23:45,710
we give ourselves problems and I think
the way to mitigate that is to exercise

3063
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:48,990
both in the sense of like a physical
sense,

3064
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:54,200
but also like almost in like a demonic
extra cyst like get the exercise,

3065
02:23:54,271 --> 02:23:57,900
all that stress out of your body,
like you're there.

3066
02:23:57,901 --> 02:24:02,901
Your body does not want to be like this
overflowing battery of stress and

3067
02:24:03,841 --> 02:24:08,250
tension and energy and when it is,
it starts fucking with you to try to

3068
02:24:08,251 --> 02:24:12,180
give you pressure and stress and give
you like consequences for this,

3069
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:17,360
for this anxiety.
I just have this insatiable drive that

3070
02:24:18,031 --> 02:24:23,031
leads to that.
A debilitating stress and anxiety that I

3071
02:24:25,111 --> 02:24:28,320
don't like.
So I think it's like what we're talking

3072
02:24:28,321 --> 02:24:29,730
about.
This is actually very helpful because

3073
02:24:29,740 --> 02:24:30,573
you don't.
I don't.

3074
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:34,350
I'm talk to anybody about this shit.
I just talked to a doctor about it for

3075
02:24:34,351 --> 02:24:35,670
the first time talking to the whole
world.

3076
02:24:35,671 --> 02:24:36,504
Then

3077
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:40,940
5 million people are going to listen to
jesus christ.

3078
02:24:41,030 --> 02:24:42,910
Alright,
I'm working on it right?

3079
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:46,370
I know the absolute mess.
If you listened this far,

3080
02:24:46,371 --> 02:24:48,870
I'm definitely on an absolute mess.
I'm working.

3081
02:24:48,871 --> 02:24:50,270
You'd like.
All of us have issues.

3082
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:51,710
You.
Everybody listening has issues.

3083
02:24:51,740 --> 02:24:53,720
There's no,
there's no perfect person and I,

3084
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:58,880
I really did at this doctor's
appointment and I just flipped and I waS

3085
02:24:59,391 --> 02:25:01,640
telling.
My wife is aware of all of this and

3086
02:25:01,641 --> 02:25:05,360
close Friends are.
But I talked to his doctor for the first

3087
02:25:05,361 --> 02:25:06,530
time.
It was like talking to a complete

3088
02:25:06,531 --> 02:25:10,280
stranger about it and all you people
about it is very,

3089
02:25:10,281 --> 02:25:13,290
very new.
I don't and people are always wearing

3090
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:13,730
that.
You know,

3091
02:25:13,730 --> 02:25:16,460
everybody laughs at me,
fucking stories of me telling People to

3092
02:25:16,461 --> 02:25:20,360
go fuck off
and they're funny.

3093
02:25:21,570 --> 02:25:23,980
They're not violent.
If

3094
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:27,860
you meet me,
you by the way at the comedy store and

3095
02:25:27,861 --> 02:25:30,550
it's like I really am the fucking nicest
guy.

3096
02:25:30,790 --> 02:25:35,440
I am a very nice dude.
But wHen pushed and pushed and pushed,

3097
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:40,530
I fucking lose my mind.
And when I see like the comedy injustice

3098
02:25:42,251 --> 02:25:43,210
going on,
I'm like,

3099
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:45,550
fuck that asshole.
Fuck that dick.

3100
02:25:46,570 --> 02:25:50,710
Because it's important to you.
It is a consequence of all your

3101
02:25:50,711 --> 02:25:51,431
ambition.
I mean,

3102
02:25:51,431 --> 02:25:52,810
that's where all the stress is coming
from.

3103
02:25:52,811 --> 02:25:55,420
It's a consequence of view and it's also
one of the reasons why you've been so

3104
02:25:55,421 --> 02:25:58,270
successful that you're constantly
pushing and making things happen and

3105
02:25:58,271 --> 02:26:00,370
getting things done.
But occasionally you're going to spend

3106
02:26:00,371 --> 02:26:01,990
your wheels.
I'd like to come back.

3107
02:26:04,270 --> 02:26:05,830
Complete person.
No,

3108
02:26:05,930 --> 02:26:09,340
I'm not going to happen,
but the next time I come back on this

3109
02:26:09,341 --> 02:26:10,174
show.
Okay,

3110
02:26:10,810 --> 02:26:14,350
you're going to the timeline.
There's gonna be a little timeline.

3111
02:26:14,770 --> 02:26:17,780
Timeline.
I'm shit.

3112
02:26:18,730 --> 02:26:21,040
I'm going on vacation.
A long vacation.

3113
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:24,340
I used to flip out on vacation.
How long are you on vacation for him to

3114
02:26:24,341 --> 02:26:28,640
go away for 10 days is a long time or a
date?

3115
02:26:28,641 --> 02:26:30,100
Three.
I start getting fidgety.

3116
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:32,170
Do you start feeling like you have work
to do?

3117
02:26:32,970 --> 02:26:37,970
I should be doing work every single day.
If you go on vacation in los angeles,

3118
02:26:37,991 --> 02:26:42,670
you will get a call to be in a movie.
You can get a call to do all this other

3119
02:26:42,671 --> 02:26:44,740
shit.
And um,

3120
02:26:45,430 --> 02:26:47,060
that's always what I haven't seen their
seat.

3121
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:50,560
I've gotten past that because I don't do
anything anymore.

3122
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:55,800
I just do podcast and stand up and then
10 times a year and that's it.

3123
02:26:55,990 --> 02:26:58,060
I worked for the ufc.
That's all I brought.

3124
02:26:58,061 --> 02:27:01,480
I brought it down to 10 times a year.
Very great spot.

3125
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:06,540
Your spot is the spot that a lot of us
comics want to get to.

3126
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:07,840
I mean,
let's be honest,

3127
02:27:07,870 --> 02:27:11,800
you because you are able to do those
things because you have,

3128
02:27:11,950 --> 02:27:14,310
you know,
worked and you'd put it in all of you.

3129
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:19,320
Put it in a lot of time to that and I
mean you working on talk radio and then

3130
02:27:21,431 --> 02:27:23,500
working on his radio news radio.
Sorry.

3131
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:28,230
Newsradio working on a fear factor for
your,

3132
02:27:28,430 --> 02:27:29,320
you know,
ufc.

3133
02:27:29,570 --> 02:27:32,830
I like the gin being a great comment
because led to this,

3134
02:27:32,831 --> 02:27:37,540
you were able to be independent and
that's fantastic.

3135
02:27:37,630 --> 02:27:42,130
I hope to get you definitely tend to.
This fear factor thing taught me a lot

3136
02:27:42,131 --> 02:27:45,430
because it was an independent and I
didn't like doing it and it was a great

3137
02:27:45,431 --> 02:27:47,740
job and it was a lot of money and I
would definitely do it again,

3138
02:27:48,010 --> 02:27:51,130
but it taught me the consequences of
doing something that you don't really

3139
02:27:51,131 --> 02:27:51,700
enjoy.

3140
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:53,800
It's not pAt,
I don't have a passion for.

3141
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:55,840
I love the people I worked with and
again,

3142
02:27:55,841 --> 02:27:57,700
it was a great job.
I'm not complaining like,

3143
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:59,050
oh,
woe is me.

3144
02:27:59,051 --> 02:28:02,290
I had a tv gig that went 148 episodes.
Crazy.

3145
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:04,780
Yeah,
I mean this crazy successful show,

3146
02:28:04,781 --> 02:28:06,940
but it wasn't what I wanted it to do
now.

3147
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,100
So while I was doing it,
it made me realize like,

3148
02:28:09,101 --> 02:28:10,990
okay,
this is not the good feeling.

3149
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:13,300
The good feeling is when you're doing
things you want to do,

3150
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:16,030
so figure out a way to when this is
over,

3151
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:19,450
never do this again.
And so when fear factor was over,

3152
02:28:19,570 --> 02:28:21,530
of course I did it again when it came
again,

3153
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:23,270
that they.
Because they came uP,

3154
02:28:23,271 --> 02:28:27,650
they came with the money so hard to
start thinking I'm a squirrel that money

3155
02:28:27,651 --> 02:28:28,910
away.
And then you know,

3156
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:30,080
it's only three days a week.

3157
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,790
What's the big deal?
You work four days,

3158
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:34,040
you know you have four days off,
you worked three days,

3159
02:28:34,310 --> 02:28:37,460
you know that guy who's on big bang,
the show,

3160
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:39,800
big bang theory.
The six lead.

3161
02:28:39,801 --> 02:28:41,660
The guy,
if you guys know the guy with the bowl

3162
02:28:41,661 --> 02:28:44,860
cut is even as like simon helberg think.
Um,

3163
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:47,750
he,
I heard that he got his,

3164
02:28:47,751 --> 02:28:52,220
uh,
his deal for syndication.

3165
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:56,180
They wrote him a check for $85.
Million dollars.

3166
02:28:57,210 --> 02:28:59,810
Yeah.
And uh,

3167
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:01,640
started here,
but it's

3168
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:06,110
not the two.
There's the two guys that are the main

3169
02:29:06,111 --> 02:29:06,944
guys,
right?

3170
02:29:06,950 --> 02:29:11,340
There's the indian guy and then he's
like the fifth or fourth.

3171
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:14,750
Yeah.
And you hear about all these shows and

3172
02:29:14,751 --> 02:29:17,930
like backing up the money truck.
Just not a lot of those shows anymore

3173
02:29:17,931 --> 02:29:19,550
though.
They used to be like friends,

3174
02:29:19,551 --> 02:29:21,710
seinfeld shows.
Yeah.

3175
02:29:21,740 --> 02:29:25,420
All those shows,
those shows when news radio went to

3176
02:29:25,430 --> 02:29:28,370
syndication,
but new news radio was never the kind of

3177
02:29:28,430 --> 02:29:29,510
commercial success.

3178
02:29:29,510 --> 02:29:32,570
And then these other shows where it
actually became a success in

3179
02:29:32,571 --> 02:29:36,740
syndication.
When news radio was on television.

3180
02:29:36,741 --> 02:29:38,840
This was when,
there was not a lot of shows on tv by

3181
02:29:38,841 --> 02:29:41,570
the way.
There was one time where my friend lou

3182
02:29:41,571 --> 02:29:42,740
morton's,
one of the writers,

3183
02:29:42,741 --> 02:29:45,500
he would,
lou would wear a tee shirt that had the

3184
02:29:45,501 --> 02:29:48,510
number that we were ranked for the week.
Uh,

3185
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:49,271
you know,
like our,

3186
02:29:49,271 --> 02:29:52,040
our,
our ratings and he came in with a number

3187
02:29:52,041 --> 02:29:53,690
88 on his shirt.
I went,

3188
02:29:53,691 --> 02:29:55,460
fuck dude,
where 88th,

3189
02:29:55,461 --> 02:29:59,060
he's like 88th,
like god down are we going to get

3190
02:29:59,061 --> 02:30:02,030
canceled?
And the only time we got cancels when I

3191
02:30:02,031 --> 02:30:03,560
didn't think we were going to get
canceled,

3192
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:06,590
which is crazy.
But um,

3193
02:30:07,020 --> 02:30:10,750
I don't remember what my point was,
no issue working on all these shows and

3194
02:30:10,751 --> 02:30:13,100
that you're not doing ideally what you
want,

3195
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:15,160
but then you know,
you have a,

3196
02:30:15,161 --> 02:30:17,750
a wife and kids and the money's so good.

3197
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:21,830
I was thinking for the longest time they
didn't want it to be like an ethnic lab

3198
02:30:21,831 --> 02:30:26,760
brand on it and one of those in cis
shows where I are,

3199
02:30:26,770 --> 02:30:30,590
the worst guy just comes to come in and
the cops come in and I go,

3200
02:30:30,591 --> 02:30:35,591
you guys aren't gonna like this
sperm came back not to sperm the sperm

3201
02:30:38,931 --> 02:30:41,210
you think it is to.
I always think of guys like david

3202
02:30:41,211 --> 02:30:43,240
caruso.
I want to think of those shows where

3203
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:45,460
they just kind of send it in.
Yeah,

3204
02:30:45,530 --> 02:30:48,150
they just mailing it in,
do that thing with his phone and get in.

3205
02:30:48,151 --> 02:30:50,360
Yeah,
every time you ever see that compilation

3206
02:30:50,361 --> 02:30:54,470
of him to just take him off of just
saying corny one liners and pulling off

3207
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:56,440
the glasses.
Yeah,

3208
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:59,750
that's what happens to you here when you
do one of those shows,

3209
02:30:59,870 --> 02:31:04,010
those shows are just designed to keep
grandma awake for another hour to sell

3210
02:31:04,011 --> 02:31:08,580
her tied and toyota trucks or whatever
the fuck they're selling the commercials

3211
02:31:08,581 --> 02:31:10,700
and then just brings me back to all
things count.

3212
02:31:10,710 --> 02:31:15,710
So atc is going to allow Just funny
people to make their own shit and make

3213
02:31:18,471 --> 02:31:20,100
it and sell it directly

3214
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:23,040
to the people without having to do,
you know,

3215
02:31:23,041 --> 02:31:28,041
worry about this network rigmarole that
we've all been piped into the network

3216
02:31:28,711 --> 02:31:30,390
rigor bar,
all that was like a real.

3217
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:32,190
There was,
there was that option at one point in

3218
02:31:32,191 --> 02:31:34,470
time that you thought that there was
going to be a pot of gold at the end of

3219
02:31:34,471 --> 02:31:37,560
the rainbow,
like a syndication deal and now that

3220
02:31:37,561 --> 02:31:41,160
stuff is almost nonexistent.
They cut all those deals out.

3221
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:42,540
Yeah,
for good reason.

3222
02:31:42,541 --> 02:31:44,000
Awesome.
Ray romano story.

3223
02:31:44,001 --> 02:31:46,910
Yeah.
About him getting his check and he

3224
02:31:46,911 --> 02:31:51,911
sitting in one of these daily grill type
places like beverly hills lunch spots

3225
02:31:52,691 --> 02:31:57,691
where all the agents go and they go,
is agency does is check that you need to

3226
02:32:00,910 --> 02:32:05,910
probably want to just go walk away,
take a look at privately,

3227
02:32:06,011 --> 02:32:10,510
just walk away and he goes into the
bathroom and he goes in and opens up the

3228
02:32:10,511 --> 02:32:13,180
check and he looks at it and he puts it
back in and it's for,

3229
02:32:13,980 --> 02:32:16,150
you know,
over $10 million type of thing.

3230
02:32:16,750 --> 02:32:19,930
And he washes his face and he can't
believe it,

3231
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:21,300
you know,
because this is a guy that was working

3232
02:32:21,370 --> 02:32:26,370
at a bank and then he was walking back
to the table and two for old ladies are

3233
02:32:28,271 --> 02:32:32,410
sitting there and they go,
excuse me,

3234
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:34,540
and he thinks so everybody loves
raymond.

3235
02:32:34,541 --> 02:32:39,541
He's fenced and these ladies say,
could you get us some more bread please?

3236
02:32:39,711 --> 02:32:44,711
When you have a chance.
And it sort of tracking made him feel

3237
02:32:45,651 --> 02:32:46,160
like,
oh,

3238
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:48,390
okay,
how could jesus like,

3239
02:32:48,650 --> 02:32:52,880
this is crazy that this is happening.
These Ladies have no idea who the fuck I

3240
02:32:52,881 --> 02:32:53,930
am.
They think I'm a waiter.

3241
02:32:53,931 --> 02:32:58,150
They're asking me for more water or
bread and it really took the air out of

3242
02:32:58,151 --> 02:33:01,430
everything and made them laugh because
you just got the fucking sweats.

3243
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:06,770
Like this is a crazy thing.
There is this pot of gold for some and

3244
02:33:06,820 --> 02:33:10,220
when I started doing standup and I still
have all these deals,

3245
02:33:10,221 --> 02:33:13,340
that's what's happening with cvs and
there it's like I'm getting.

3246
02:33:13,341 --> 02:33:18,341
I've had my own family sitcom script
seven times and so like are the

3247
02:33:19,881 --> 02:33:22,180
development deals that give you a bad
deal.

3248
02:33:22,190 --> 02:33:26,230
Slava cash slab,
a cash and a script and matched up with

3249
02:33:26,231 --> 02:33:27,850
the show runner.
Show runners.

3250
02:33:27,970 --> 02:33:32,140
Last one is called call me al.
Then I wrote another one called mr

3251
02:33:32,230 --> 02:33:34,960
macho.
Mr. Macho is a good idea.

3252
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:37,330
Is a good script.
Why the name though?

3253
02:33:37,410 --> 02:33:41,820
Oh,
so flip out a mexicans making fun of me.

3254
02:33:42,110 --> 02:33:44,760
Was it mr macho?
what's up bro?

3255
02:33:46,850 --> 02:33:49,250
Me,
me living in latino neighborhoods.

3256
02:33:49,251 --> 02:33:53,240
So then good stuff that could be a show
and you want to do that?

3257
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:56,960
Oh man.
Right now I have my own like single

3258
02:33:56,961 --> 02:34:00,190
camera comedy on the air and yeah,
you like that as much as standup.

3259
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:02,720
I love acting.
I love writing,

3260
02:34:02,721 --> 02:34:03,590
making shit.
Yeah.

3261
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:04,800
That's awesome.
Then.

3262
02:34:05,140 --> 02:34:06,770
Yeah,
and I really enjoy it.

3263
02:34:06,830 --> 02:34:09,050
Like it's got to be in the writer's room
on.

3264
02:34:09,051 --> 02:34:11,720
I'm dying up here.
There's one of the best experiences are.

3265
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:14,930
And when does that come out?
When it's on showtime.

3266
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:16,153
Beautiful hair.

Love it so much I'm sure.
And it's kind of sexy bitch.

3268
02:34:20,710 --> 02:34:24,130
Look at you and that god damn amazing
outfit and that beautiful mustache.

3269
02:34:24,220 --> 02:34:25,810
Whoa.
I love it.

3270
02:34:26,220 --> 02:34:29,990
When you start dressing like that again.
Totally feel they look better with

3271
02:34:30,050 --> 02:34:31,060
beautiful apelles.

3272
02:34:32,070 --> 02:34:32,821
Alright brother.
So,

3273
02:34:32,821 --> 02:34:34,200

3274
02:34:35,550 --> 02:34:37,950
which is tomorrow,
I'm shrimping,

3275
02:34:37,951 --> 02:34:41,340
ain't easy on showtime.
Is it going to be available online at

3276
02:34:41,341 --> 02:34:41,920
all?

3277
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:43,360
Well,
this is the thing,

3278
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:48,420
they gave me a code.
So if you go to showtime or show.com

3279
02:34:49,720 --> 02:34:52,630
forward slash shrimping and I put this
up.

3280
02:34:52,631 --> 02:34:56,080
So this is on my twitter,

3281
02:34:56,290 --> 02:34:56,970
Oh,

3282
02:34:56,970 --> 02:34:57,500
Beautiful.
Launch.

3283
02:34:57,500 --> 02:35:00,190
A special.
You can watch it on the amp and then

3284
02:35:00,191 --> 02:35:04,030
that's the same is true for.
I'm dying up here.

3285
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:06,160
I think I'm going to have another code
for that.

3286
02:35:06,161 --> 02:35:10,210
so you could really get two months.
Is showtime free out of this thing if

3287
02:35:10,211 --> 02:35:10,720

I,

3288
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:13,190
paul put the codes up and people can
just grab the code.

3289
02:35:13,191 --> 02:35:17,390
Do you know what I'll do is I'll throw
the codes in my instagram and my twitter

3290
02:35:17,391 --> 02:35:20,770
