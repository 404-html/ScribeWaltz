1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,790
We give zero fucks.

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:04,800
Your Ratha drove Joe Rohde.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,510
The experience for people
who don't understand what
you're talking about here at

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,310
[inaudible]

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,310
your premise or a big part of it
is that there is somewhere around,

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,071
what is it,

7
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:17,750
10,000 years ago,

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,360
somewhere around then towards
the end of the last ice age,

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,130
humanity was probably mostly wiped
out or wiped out in a big way.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,720
And we had to rebuild from there

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,510
build.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:27,850
And we,

13
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,530
and I believe that we lost,

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,220
uh,

15
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,260
a civilization at that time,

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,460
the entire civilization,

17
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,230
which is not being recorded by history,

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:35,970
uh,

19
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,650
and that it went underwater
with the rising sea levels.

20
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:43,270
And what led me to this [inaudible] the
reason I became interested in pursuing

21
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:46,930
that line of inquiry was the Ark of
the covenant because it seemed to me,

22
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,680
it seemed to me like a piece of technology
that was out of its place in history,

23
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,060
in the way that it was described.

24
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,480
I'm not wishing to put down the
spiritual aspects because they are there.

25
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,150
Uh,

26
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,960
but there were definite
technological aspects to this device.

27
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,550
And then I had to ask myself,

28
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:00,731
well,

29
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:02,680
where could that knowledge have come from?

30
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,060
And through Egypt,

31
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,140
we then start to find that Egypt
itself looks back to an older time.

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,070
The ancient Egyptians did
in regard themselves as the
beginning of their story.

33
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:14,680
They regarded themselves as quite
a late point in their story.

34
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,080
And they look back to
the time of the gods,

35
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:20,980
which they called Zep Tepi the first
time when there was a golden age.

36
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:21,611
And they speak,

37
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,480
and there are texts,

38
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:22,841
the head,

39
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:23,690
foot building texts,

40
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:25,750
which speak of the guards
living on an island,

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,850
a gigantic flood coming.

42
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,470
Most of the guards are killed.

43
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:30,730
Odd thing to happen to gods.

44
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,050
And then they,

45
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:32,500
uh,

46
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,730
come and settle in Egypt.

47
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,530
The survivors come and settle in Egypt.

48
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,393
Um,

49
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,320
Egypt is the product of an
even far earlier civilization,

50
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,770
but,

51
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,680
but the history of Egypt goes back way,

52
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,900
way further than people think it does.

53
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,590
That's my view.

54
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,250
That's my view.

55
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,840
I support that view.

56
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,850
And I was astonished when you had,

57
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:51,420
um,

58
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,490
Robert Schoch and John Anthony West,

59
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:56,490
when they brought their findings
about the erosion on the,

60
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:56,970
the,

61
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,230
the temple of the Sphinx.

62
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:58,650
Yes.

63
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,830
They brought these findings to
these academics and just the,

64
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,630
the tone of their voice,

65
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,360
the way they were
approaching the information,

66
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:06,810
the,

67
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,150
the mocking attitude that they had of it.

68
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:09,301
Well,

69
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,880
where is the civilization you speak
up because they're talking about a

70
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,770
civilization that was possibly what,

71
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:15,620
10,000 BC or something?

72
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,513
Yeah,

73
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:16,850
well,

74
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,380
I would put the finger
right about 10,500 BC.

75
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,273
What people,

76
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,420
if you don't know the,

77
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:21,661
the,

78
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:21,961
the,

79
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,980
the story behind it.

80
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:26,460
There's water erosion on the edge of the,

81
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:26,661
uh,

82
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:26,911
the,

83
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:30,240
the tempo of the Sphinx has done that
could only be attributed to thousands of

84
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,073
years of rainfall.

85
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,600
The last time there was rain
fall in the Nile Valley was,

86
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:33,871
what is it,

87
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:33,960
the

88
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,540
breakthrough work that John
Anthony West and Robert Schoch did?

89
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,430
Did it the initial observation,

90
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,210
um,

91
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,290
what came through John,

92
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,281
um,

93
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:41,881
who is,

94
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,640
uh,

95
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,420
an astonishingly knowledgeable
man about ancient Egypt.

96
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:47,660
He's not a official Egyptologist,

97
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:50,040
but he spent his whole life
working in ancient Egypt.

98
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,960
And through his research
and his background,

99
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:52,441
he came to,

100
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:56,760
he came to realize that the erosion
patterns on the Sphinx are really odd.

101
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:01,360
And he then went to shock a Robert Schoch
at the University of Boston who is a

102
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,550
geologist and an open minded one.

103
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,421
And he said,

104
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:07,660
would you come to Egypt with me and
give me your geological opinion on this

105
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,091
monument?

106
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:09,510
So shock went there and,

107
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,060
and it was immediately clear to him
that this monument had been subjected to

108
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,360
thousands of years of heavy rainfall
at some point in its history.

109
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,890
And that's where the mystery begins
because the study of ancient climates is

110
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,000
quite well advanced.

111
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,800
And we know that 5,000 years ago,

112
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,000
four and a half thousand years ago,

113
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,860
when the Sphinx is supposed
to have been built,

114
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,610
Egypt was as bone dry as it is today.

115
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,420
And you have to go back some
thousands of years before that,

116
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,480
at least to about 9,000 years ago to get
the very heavy rainfall that would have

117
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,280
caused the erosion of the Sphinx.

118
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:46,270
But that only means that the Sphinx was
standing there 9,000 years ago to be

119
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,104
rained on.

120
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,890
Uh,

121
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,080
it may be much older than that.

122
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,690
A shock is cautious and he will not,

123
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,250
he will not push the date back beyond
what the hard evidence suggests.

124
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:57,761
He's willing to,

125
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:00,940
he is what he does except that the
Sphinx may well have stood there,

126
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,540
uh,

127
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,250
before the heavy rains began.

128
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,780
But how long before is a,

129
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,060
is a matter that he cannot be certain on.

130
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:07,894
And that's where,

131
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:08,710
uh,

132
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:13,710
Robert Bovard and I were able to take
the matter on a little further with the

133
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,620
astronomy of the Giza plateau.

134
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,810
And you find there's this,

135
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:22,360
just this stunning thing
that happens in the sky.

136
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,110
I mean,

137
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,830
this is one of,

138
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,550
one of the,

139
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,241
the great things.

140
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:27,010
I have some problems with technology,

141
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,100
but I have to say one of the great things
about computer technology is the way

142
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:34,390
that it can speed up access to information
in an incredibly efficient way.

143
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,790
And there are computer programs now,

144
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,560
which we'll show you exactly how the
stars were positioned at any time in the

145
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,000
last 30,000 years over.

146
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,560
At any point on the earth's surface,

147
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:47,860
you can literally wind back
the ancient skies and see them.

148
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:52,180
And this skies do change because the earth
is the viewing platform from which we

149
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,200
observe the stars.

150
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,300
There's a wobble on the axis
of the earth course session.

151
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,221
That's right.

152
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,700
And the wobble takes 20 to
26,000 years to complete a cycle.

153
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,740
So it's a cyclical process.

154
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,070
Eventually the stars will all return
to starting point and begin the cycle

155
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:06,640
again.

156
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,600
And because of that,

157
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,070
we can say that the Sphinx was gazing
at his own celestial counterpart,

158
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:16,510
the Constellation of Leo at dawn
on the Spring Equinox in 10,000 BC,

159
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,670
while 90 degrees away,

160
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Jews south or Ryan was lying on the
Meridian in exactly the pattern of the

161
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,540
pyramids on the ground.

162
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,081
It doesn't,

163
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,940
John Anthony West go even deeper.

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,040
He believes it's like 30,000 BCE.

165
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,600
John John thinks it might be pushed
back another processional cycle.

166
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,201
See the we,

167
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,520
we take it back to,

168
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,460
to that 12 and a half thousand years ago.

169
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,910
Uh,

170
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,140
but you would have the same alignments
and now they're 26,000 years earlier.

171
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,790
So 38,000 years ago,

172
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,790
you would have the same alignments as
you had 12 and a half thousand years.

173
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,970
Doesn't he based it on actual hieroglyphs
to depict the inches of the pharaohs?

174
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,701
And absolutely.

175
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:55,120
Right.

176
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,780
There's the,

177
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,381
and again,

178
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,910
this is the area where the Egyptologists,

179
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,260
the academic Egyptologists are incredibly
annoying because they will not listen

180
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,540
to what the ancient Egyptians
themselves have to say.

181
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,351
It's as though they,

182
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:10,100
the academics know more about ancient
Egyptian history than the ancient

183
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,180
Egyptians did themselves.

184
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:14,120
And the ancient Egyptians
were really very clear.

185
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:14,830
They,

186
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,310
they push their history back,

187
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:19,260
well plus 30,000 years offensive.

188
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,820
Why don't they,

189
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,390
why,

190
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,940
why won't they buy a dryer?

191
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,111
They,

192
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:22,944
so again,

193
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,740
I wondered that myself.

194
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,220
Uh,

195
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,540
when I first got into this,

196
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,070
I initially couldn't understand it,

197
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:28,701
but I think,

198
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,010
I think it's a problem
with science in general.

199
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:31,580
Uh,

200
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,413
I think that,

201
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,740
was it a late discovery?

202
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,420
Did they have an established timeline?

203
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:35,800
They,

204
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,620
I'm ready.

205
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,340
Just the timeline.

206
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,890
The timeline was set literally in stone,

207
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,150
uh,

208
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,640
over the last sort of last 50,

209
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:44,930
50 years of the 20th century.

210
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:48,200
I mean really burdened by the
beginning of the 20th century,

211
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,220
a timeline had been worked
out and by the 1950s it was

212
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,290
very much set.

213
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,240
So they are just not willing
to consider any previous day.

214
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:59,460
There would anything goes
the whole timeline out.

215
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,140
And because they've been
teaching it for so long,

216
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:02,770
they're reluctant to open up to new ideas.

217
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:03,741
But,

218
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:03,920
uh,

219
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,210
but also they themselves,

220
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm,

221
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,821
I'm,

222
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,910
I'm not suggesting any
dishonesty on their part.

223
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:11,120
They themselves absolutely
believe their version of the past.

224
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,060
And in all fairness,

225
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:12,301
you know,

226
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:12,991
Robert Shocks,

227
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:14,520
depiction of the erosion,

228
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:15,750
there have been dissenters,

229
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:16,584
and I've read some,

230
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,760
some different people's pavers,

231
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:19,530
but they seem very logical.

232
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,890
I mean,

233
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,300
I looked at it myself,

234
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:22,830
I know what water erosion looks like.

235
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:24,000
Obviously I'm not a geologist,

236
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,340
but when I look at it and you
say that that's wind and sand,

237
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:29,610
and then they showed extreme
examples of wind in Santa Rosa.

238
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:29,890
Well,

239
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,840
it doesn't look the same.

240
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:31,290
There's,

241
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,030
it looks like there's crevices.

242
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:34,410
It's been created by water.

243
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:35,460
It's really obvious.

244
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,353
It really does.

245
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,690
And,

246
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,450
and then there's so much else,

247
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,220
uh,

248
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,480
that,

249
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,340
that adds to that.

250
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,620
I mean there's this
thinks is not alone there.

251
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,461
There are other,

252
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:48,450
whether it's structures out there on the
Giza plateau or the ones under deep and

253
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:53,000
they find ones that are underground that
are these old style construction ones

254
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,140
that were built much like this,

255
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:55,710
the temple,

256
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,220
the Sphinx,

257
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,690
but not like the later stuff.

258
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,600
Then it looks like two
different areas of construction.

259
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,101
It does.

260
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,750
It looks like two phases of construction.

261
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:03,680
One very ancient,

262
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:07,030
one more recent and they've got
muddled up in the academics mind

263
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,410
watching doctor shock.

264
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,620
Try to talk to the
Egyptologists about that was,

265
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,840
it was a fascinating thing because the
guy got super defensive and he was like,

266
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:18,201
where?

267
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:20,950
Where is this civilization you're
speaking of this 10,000 Polo?

268
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,640
Quick Glance,

269
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:21,990
right?

270
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,823
It was like this,

271
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,330
Marx was mark Laner who's an Egyptologist
at the Oriental Institute in Chicago

272
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,830
and one of the lead Western
archeologists working in Giza,

273
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:32,071
you know,

274
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:32,791
and his remark,

275
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,780
which we call it often was,

276
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:34,614
you know,

277
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,180
show me the pot shirt,

278
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,800
whereas the pot shit from this,

279
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:38,970
from this lost civilization.

280
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,660
Well,

281
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,660
the argument was at that time that the
Sphinx cannot possibly be of that age

282
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,130
because there's nothing else
in the world of that age.

283
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:49,260
How could it just be
this one unique thing,

284
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,410
which is 12 and a half thousand
years old or maybe older?

285
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,160
Uh,

286
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,480
there's amazing the monument.

287
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,580
How can that alone then?

288
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,350
So show me the pictures of
the rest of that civilization.

289
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,460
Well,

290
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,810
some years later those
poachers have started to turn
up and they've turned up in

291
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:04,644
Turkey,

292
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,041
uh,

293
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,410
in the form of a Jaguar,

294
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,320
the a gigantic megalithic circle,

295
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,010
uh,

296
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,100
which dates back to
precisely 12,000 years ago

297
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,610
and even has carvings of animals that
don't exist anywhere near Turkey on the,

298
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,623
on this thing.

299
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,200
And they're trying to attribute
it to hunter gatherers,

300
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,270
which is hilarious.

301
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:23,761
It's really,

302
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:24,690
it's really hilarious.

303
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,050
The,

304
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,401
these,

305
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,130
these were people who had a,

306
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:30,390
an organized and systematic,

307
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,410
a civilization,

308
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,740
and it was somehow or another
intentionally covered up,

309
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,250
right?

310
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,000
They buried it.

311
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,750
They buried these gigantic,

312
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,990
like 12 foot tall,

313
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,050
beautiful stone carvings were
like lizards on them and stuff.

314
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,920
By the way that the ancient Egyptians
themselves decommissioned some of their

315
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,260
temples when they knew
their system was going down.

316
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,060
They knew it was going down.

317
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,220
The Romans were the end of it for Egypt.

318
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,210
Egypt thrived through the Greek period.

319
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,950
When the Greeks arrived in Egypt,

320
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,690
what happened was the Egyptians colonize
the Greek mind and the Greeks became

321
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:05,524
Egyptians,

322
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,970
but when the Romans took over,

323
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,260
it was a different story.

324
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,190
That's my people.

325
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,750
They fat everywhere still.

326
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,681
We're still,

327
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:12,100
yeah.

328
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,020
That when the Romans made this
alliance with Christianity and the the,

329
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:17,311
the,

330
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:17,561
the,

331
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:20,200
the Christian Church pulled
on the Jackboot of Rome.

332
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,350
It was Christians who really
wanted to take Egypt apart.

333
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,680
They wanted to destroy everything and
the Egyptian priests themselves rather

334
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:29,260
than let their temples fall
into their hands in that way,

335
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,010
they went around and destroyed certain
things in the temples and they did so

336
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:33,341
quite,

337
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,540
quite deliberately to remove that power
from the others who were going to come

338
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,310
and take it in.

339
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,140
I sit down,

340
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,820
I've only been to a couple places.

341
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,770
I've been to teach an EATSA.

342
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,350
Yeah.

343
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,020
I've never been to Egypt,

344
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:45,990
but I've been to a,

345
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:46,461
at the,

346
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:46,970
um,

347
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,540
one of the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston had an Egyptian exhibit.

348
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,050
They had all this
amazing old shit and the,

349
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,190
it is so hard to wrap your head around
even the established timeline of 2,500 BC

350
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,270
when you're looking at the structures,

351
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,010
it's so hard to wrap your head around.

352
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,600
Like when you're looking at a beautiful
gold and covered sarcophagus that you

353
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:07,730
know,

354
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,260
had king tut inside of it.

355
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,041
It's like,

356
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:10,610
what,

357
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,410
what was that like?

358
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,041
You know,

359
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,430
what kind of a weird
alternative way to live.

360
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:21,431
Did these guys figure out where they
[inaudible] ends of years ago figured out

361
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,670
how to build these almost perfect
geometric structures of 2 million,

362
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:30,170
300,000 stones where if you fuck
up just a little bit here or there,

363
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
by the time you get to the top it's done.

364
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:32,451
And they're like,

365
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:32,571
well,

366
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:33,770
they did screw up a few of them.

367
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:34,311
There's a few of them.

368
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:34,970
The lopsided.

369
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,211
Yeah,

370
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:35,361
yeah,

371
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:35,570
yeah.

372
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,770
But they got them right to who knows
who the hell was doing the screw up ones

373
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:41,030
that could have been imitators hands

374
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,020
were done later.

375
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:42,700
Uh,

376
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,070
by,

377
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,180
by um,

378
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,133
the copiers.

379
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,180
Yeah.

380
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,310
Basically that's the mystery
of Egypt is that that a,

381
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:50,960
and John West makes this point,

382
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,940
but that it's perfect at the,

383
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,120
and it slowly declines.

384
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,740
This is not what we expect.

385
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,410
We expect to see
civilizations slowly rise.

386
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,970
We don't expect to see them perfect,

387
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,970
fully formed at the beginning
and then take 3000 years to end.

388
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,380
Right.

389
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,830
Well even when you push back the
established timeline and you know,

390
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,110
we,

391
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,430
we can't even wrap our head
around a thousand years.

392
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:11,761
I mean,

393
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:14,010
a thousand years is very
difficult to wrap her head around.

394
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,050
Why do you think it's so difficult
for them to embrace the pretty obvious

395
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,780
possibility that things get wiped out?

396
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:21,961
I mean,

397
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:23,700
there's the craters all over the moon.

398
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,550
We know there's all
sorts of spots all over,

399
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:26,881
you know,

400
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,520
you'll go drive by the giant crater,

401
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:28,921
Nevada,

402
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:29,910
it's a mile wide,

403
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,331
boom,

404
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:31,164
something hits,

405
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,310
everybody gets fucked.

406
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,670
And I mean that easily could have
happened over and over again throughout

407
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,260
history.

408
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,140
And just the s that seems to me to be
way more likely then we made it all the

409
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:42,150
way from caveman to here without a hiccup,

410
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,190
without a single hiccup.

411
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,173
That's crazy.

412
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,380
And this leads,

413
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:45,651
you know,

414
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:45,891
this,

415
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:46,161
this,

416
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:47,360
this leads to,

417
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:47,470
it's,

418
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:47,880
it's an,

419
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,250
it led me to conclude that
that academic history,

420
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,150
um,

421
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,961
is part of,

422
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:54,794
uh,

423
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,970
this sounds a bit paranoid,

424
00:12:55,971 --> 00:13:00,320
but part of an overall system of kind
of mind control that that operates.

425
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,010
There are certain things
that we're allowed to think
and certain parameters that

426
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,200
we are allowed to think
within in our society.

427
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,531
And,

428
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:08,090
and when it comes to the past,

429
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:11,480
those parameters I set by academics
and they'd get so territorial,

430
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:14,180
it's so defensive when you
try to break out of that,

431
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:14,850
uh,

432
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,141
and,

433
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:16,260
and suggest other parts.

434
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,401
See,

435
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:17,600
I thought naively,

436
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:20,140
when I got into this at first that,

437
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:20,310
uh,

438
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,260
those who were specialists in this
field would welcome some new ideas.

439
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,800
Um,

440
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,390
they might throw them out in the end,

441
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,090
but they would want to see whether
there was any merit to the ideas.

442
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,060
And so initially I was really
shocked that the attitude is,

443
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,241
oh,

444
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:33,530
this idea doesn't agree with us.

445
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,900
We are going to destroy this
idea in any way we can add.

446
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,280
Not only that we're going to destroy the
individuals associated with this idea.

447
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:42,020
We will attack the man and the idea.

448
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,880
Exactly,

449
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,391
exactly.

450
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,860
And a very dirty tricks kind of way.

451
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,970
It's only later on actually that I came
to realize that academic soul treat each

452
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:50,930
other this way as well.

453
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:51,764
They're all there.

454
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,750
They're all very at very territorial.

455
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:54,830
They are all ego driven.

456
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:59,420
They have their power base in a particular
view and they defend that view to

457
00:13:59,421 --> 00:13:59,900
the,

458
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,600
to the death.

459
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,810
Now when you say the doctor's
shock is a very conservative,

460
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,220
you're,

461
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,260
you're not joking around about that and
I always wonder when I hear some of the

462
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,660
things that he says about
other ancient structures,

463
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,401
I was wondering,

464
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:10,591
wow,

465
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:14,100
I wonder if he took too much heat from
the Sphinx and now he like backs off on

466
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:14,720
stuff.

467
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,070
He's very,

468
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,930
the Bosnian pyramid and
even the Japanese structure.

469
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,330
Yes,

470
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:18,851
I went there.

471
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:19,900
I went there with shock.

472
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,100
He's crazy and shock would not,

473
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,560
that's crazy.

474
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,430
He shut when the shark,

475
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,500
a shark would not accept that it was a,

476
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,070
a manmade structure bed.

477
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,970
But I have to say that at that point,

478
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,920
um,

479
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,460
[inaudible] is a very difficult dive.

480
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,090
It's a very difficult diet.

481
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,220
The seas are wild.

482
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,910
There's a huge current flows right in
front of the monument and you have to be

483
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,850
an accomplished diver to do any work.

484
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,600
Uh,

485
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,600
shock was on his second open water dive
at this point and a on those initial

486
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,870
dives that we did on Yana Goonie.

487
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,800
Um,

488
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,140
he was largely fighting for his life.

489
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,600
You guys are balls.

490
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,823
I love it.

491
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,113
It's very,

492
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,843
yeah.

493
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,130
My wife Santha who's a photographer
and I sent this right here with us,

494
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,440
have done um,

495
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:07,990
uh,

496
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,740
more than 200 plus dives on
the Yana Goonie monument.

497
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,210
We went through the process of learning
to dive and really getting the skills to

498
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:17,860
be able to handle that kind of current,

499
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:21,490
which is literally going to rip your mask
off your face and take your regulator

500
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:22,324
out of your mouth.

501
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,070
Um,

502
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:23,520
it's,

503
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,590
it's like swimming in a river
against the current actually.

504
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,610
So what I would say is that I think
shock was a little premature with that

505
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:31,960
conclusion and I think,

506
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:32,200
uh,

507
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,401
he,

508
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:32,651
he's,

509
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:34,280
I have huge respect for Robert Schoch.

510
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,630
I have huge respect for his openness
of mind at his geological acumen,

511
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,170
but it not enough time was spent on
the monument to reach that decision.

512
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:42,400
And it's not just one monument.

513
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,930
It's a whole complex of monuments.

514
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:48,670
And further north of settles
it for me off a Okinawa,

515
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,620
which is about four or
500 miles north of yonder.

516
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,550
Goonie dairy's a majestic stone circle,

517
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,590
110 feet beneath the water.

518
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:57,041
Which again,

519
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,290
something I've dived on extensively,

520
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,420
which shock has not seen a,

521
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:05,520
which is there's just no way on earth
that that monument could have been two

522
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,550
photos of this online.

523
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:06,881
Yes,

524
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:07,241
we do.

525
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:08,170
We have photos on my words.

526
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,023
What I look for.

527
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,850
Um,

528
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,121
okay.

529
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:12,270
You go onto www dot.

530
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,720
I'm sure if I just Google it,

531
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,010
go to Graham hancock.com.

532
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,993
Okay.

533
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,590
And then go to gallery.

534
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,813
Okay.

535
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,750
And then go to underwater.

536
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:24,130
We have underwater on the gallery

537
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,973
underwater.

538
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,880
Yes.

539
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,930
And in the underwater section you're going
to see a stone circle somewhere there

540
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,500
with uh,

541
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,660
with somebody above it
holding a video camera.

542
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:38,950
That's me holding the video camera.

543
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,900
Oh yeah.

544
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,021
And down on the,

545
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:44,950
down below you is a stone circle and
there's probably some more shots of it.

546
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:46,750
I'm going to just come around and
see what you're looking at there.

547
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,940
I was looking at this right here.

548
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:49,391
Is that okay?

549
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:49,630
Yeah,

550
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,680
that's the stone circle.

551
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,950
This is the central upright and these are
the surrounding uprights that somebody

552
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:57,610
made that get out of this thing.

553
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,080
This thing is 12 feet high.

554
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,610
Wow.

555
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,190
And it's 110 feet beneath the sea.

556
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
That's so cool.

557
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,080
Wow.

558
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,980
That's incredible.

559
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,660
That's amazing.

560
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,190
It's the most extraordinary thing.

561
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,000
Um,

562
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and 110 feet beneath the sea tells us
that it was made at least 13,000 years ago

563
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,560
because that's the last time that
110 foot level was above sea level.

564
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:21,321
So.

565
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:22,101
Well that makes sense.

566
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:24,590
With Robert Schoch about these ruins,

567
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,050
the Japanese ruins cause there's one
of them that really freaked me out.

568
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:29,090
I watched a documentary on
it where they showed this,

569
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,370
these two monolith,

570
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:30,611
so we,

571
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:31,251
we talked earlier,

572
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,850
I described them as pizza boxes there
with the giant stone pizza boxes.

573
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,880
There were so perfectly cut and
laying right next to each other.

574
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,520
I would just think you would look at
that and you'd have to throw everything

575
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:40,971
else away.

576
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:41,700
You look at that anyway.

577
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,340
That's not a natural phenomenon.

578
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,880
Somebody,

579
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,160
there's right angles
everywhere that sends off.

580
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,250
It does.

581
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:47,470
I mean

582
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:47,520
the,

583
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:47,730
the,

584
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:47,910
the,

585
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,110
the beauty and the perfection.

586
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,771
The thing is,

587
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:50,880
is is part of it,

588
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:54,630
but part of it which needs to be
needs to be taken into account.

589
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,660
I can understand why some geologists
feel that it must be natural and this is

590
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,460
the,

591
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,640
this is the reason that the stone is a
sedimentary stone is laid down in layers

592
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,910
and some of the layers are
soft and some of them are hard.

593
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,470
And their argument is that the sea
battering against these less selectively

594
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:17,850
removed the soft layers and left the
hardware's producing this step defect.

595
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,240
The problem with that is
that if that happened,

596
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,530
then you would expect to see the very
large amount of rubble which was created

597
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,120
by removing all these layers.

598
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,620
You would expect to see it lying in a
disorganized mass down at the bottom of

599
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:32,454
the monument,

600
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,061
uh,

601
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,100
which the tea from top to bottom,

602
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:36,870
the monuments about 70 feet high.

603
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,310
So 70 feet down and all of
it's underwater because the,

604
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,810
it's the bottom is about
110 feet below the sea.

605
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,920
So you would expect to find that rubble
lying at the base of the monument.

606
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,390
Actually what you do find is a beautiful
path cut out of solid rock at the base

607
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:56,391
of the monument and all the rubble cleared
to the side pushed away a forming a

608
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,270
bank,

609
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,330
which is no way on earth that
could have been done by nature.

610
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,470
It had to be done by men.

611
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:01,911
That's what peer,

612
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:02,790
that's what people do.

613
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,661
They clear away,

614
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:04,020
rubble,

615
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,940
tidy it up and leave a nice looking site.

616
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,870
And that's what,

617
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,560
that's what is,

618
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,191
that's what is there.

619
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,600
So it's little details like that.

620
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,260
Plus the fact that there
isn't just one monument,

621
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:14,700
there's actually about five,

622
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,521
uh,

623
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,240
along a good four miles of the coast,

624
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,050
uh,

625
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,690
makes it impossible for me to accept
that it's a natural phenomenon.

626
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,640
And I guess the question
comes up when you,

627
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:29,320
when you talk about ancient monuments
are ancient civilizations for 14,000 plus

628
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:29,950
years ago,

629
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,780
how much really would be left?

630
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,041
It's a long time.

631
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,860
The sole long aren't.

632
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,730
We are to put it in perspective,

633
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:40,330
the House that we're in and 14,000
years will absolutely not be here.

634
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,260
Now if we leave,

635
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,910
it's going to be completely gone.

636
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:44,050
There'll be almost no evidence.

637
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,270
The earth will devour these computers.

638
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:49,990
It will devour the leather and the table
and the chairs to rueful cave in and

639
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:51,280
we'll all go into dirt,

640
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:51,551
dirt.

641
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:52,540
We'll fill it over.

642
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,860
Lava will come.

643
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,491
Earthquakes,

644
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:55,750
we'll shift things.

645
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,530
He'll be gone,

646
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,363
will be forgotten,

647
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:57,881
forgotten,

648
00:19:57,881 --> 00:19:58,630
forgotten.

649
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,170
Um,

650
00:19:59,170 --> 00:19:59,921
it would be very,

651
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:01,120
very easy for that to happen.

652
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,700
So then consider the effect of ice,

653
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,661
uh,

654
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,201
considered it.

655
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,340
Consider the fact that,

656
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:06,700
uh,

657
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,990
during the last ice age,

658
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:13,350
North America and northern Europe were
covered with these gigantic ice caps that

659
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,531
you're talking ice,

660
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,300
which is two to three miles deep.

661
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,430
Your website's getting crushed right now.

662
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,100
Generally do it on your website.

663
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,810
Sorry,

664
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,300
what were up to you?

665
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,420
It's getting smashed.

666
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:26,970
Could use.

667
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,190
Yeah.

668
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,630
There's a lot of people on that soccer.

669
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,493
Glad to hear it.

670
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,300
Um,

671
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,031
you know,

672
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:31,331
so,

673
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,410
so I'm sorry,

674
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:33,244
I lost my thread there.

675
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,803
North America.

676
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,220
So the ice forms on the continental
land mass of the u s end of Europe,

677
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,030
it builds up to a depth of
two miles and it's in motion.

678
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,930
Consider what's to anything underneath
that under two miles of ice.

679
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,320
It's being ground to a
powder to a fine powder.

680
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:53,651
It's like,

681
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:54,010
uh,

682
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,110
it's like just wiping out,

683
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,030
literally wiping out the past.

684
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:05,850
Okay.
