1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,660
Have you heard of a guy
named Peter pop off?

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,040
He's a pastor.

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,750
Was televangelists guys,

5
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,663
what did he do?

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,631
I saw him the other day.

7
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:10,290
I watched a,

8
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,480
I was sleeping on the
couch and I woke up in his,

9
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,510
he had one of those shows on a page
shows commercials and I was amazed what,

10
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,790
what woke me up cause I was kind of
like half listening to while sleeping.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,970
What was amazed as how the
things that they say in it,

12
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,320
it just seemed to illegal.

13
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,303
Like they were like,

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,110
you like,

15
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,520
oh you know we're going to
send you some miracle water.

16
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:30,211
This water is,

17
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:30,420
you know,

18
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,290
miracle water,

19
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,910
you're going to open up these envelopes.

20
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,270
And then they start showing
like testimonials like of
people and they're like,

21
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:36,870
you know,

22
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,950
I sent in my,

23
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,720
or I read the letters and then just a
week later I got a new house and a car and

24
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,710
then the next person was like,

25
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,730
I got $200,000 and then
there's other ones,

26
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,160
like a guy just walked up and
gave me a check for $15 million.

27
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:50,850
And it was,

28
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,620
it was like the most fake as shit ever.

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,730
And so then I started really researching
this guy and there's all these videos

30
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:57,600
about him online,

31
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,990
I guess he's been ripping
people off for a long time,

32
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,740
and one of the best videos is one
where he just goes up and he goes,

33
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,280
where's we're so Ansel,

34
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,051
so and so's here.

35
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:07,260
Like,

36
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:07,530
listen,

37
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,520
let's say Tina,

38
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,151
Tina Fey,

39
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:09,541
where are you?

40
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,320
Where are you at?

41
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,310
And comes up and goes,

42
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,180
I heard you have arthritis and you're
here because you want to get rid of this

43
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:15,481
author.

44
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:16,530
Itus and stuff like that.

45
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,780
And the whole time his
wife is just pumping,

46
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,060
she had a thing on,

47
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,190
it was on one of those 2020
or something like that.

48
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,880
Yeah.

49
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,230
I know we talked about this in the past.

50
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm pretty sure maybe it
was on another podcast,

51
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,960
but I was amazed that he's
still allowed to do this.

52
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:30,121
Yeah,

53
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:30,360
yeah,

54
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,170
yeah,

55
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,530
yeah.

56
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,363
Well that guy

57
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,460
named one is not,

58
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,990
but it's almost like,

59
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,280
it's so ridiculous.

60
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,020
It's like the most
ridiculous hustle lever.

61
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,501
It's like,

62
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,460
who are they tricking?

63
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,750
The only people that tricking or like
they're almost like mentally challenged.

64
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:46,740
Oh yeah.

65
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,300
People with no hope when you're,

66
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:48,780
when you're done,

67
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,230
we just robots when you're down to being
convinced that there's a miracle water

68
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,120
out there that is going
to come in the mail,

69
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,590
be of the postal service
and it's going to look,

70
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,260
it's going to change your fortune,

71
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:58,800
right?

72
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,011
Yeah.

73
00:01:59,011 --> 00:01:59,820
That's the one,

74
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,080
one of these things somewhere along the
line they used to ask for donations but

75
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,850
then somewhere along the line they,

76
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:06,090
uh,

77
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,620
they realized that they could sell
things and they started like selling like

78
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:14,720
holy water and selling
like prayer services and,

79
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,470
and,

80
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:15,750
and,

81
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,810
and telling people that
you would plant a seed.

82
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,191
So I'll be like,

83
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,024
spend $90,

84
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,410
Jill,

85
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,280
last $90.

86
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:24,070
He would come back to you in 10 fold.

87
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,050
The Bible says,

88
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:28,050
and it would come out with
some crazy fucking was that,

89
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:28,470
um,

90
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,470
the Guy Creflo dollar is my favorite
because it's got a dollar in his name.

91
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,200
I mean,

92
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,240
you're a pastor and your
fucking name is dollar.

93
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,800
What's your real name or names like that?

94
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,020
Peter Popoff.

95
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,710
Have you ever met any
other pop offs before?

96
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,000
This guy's got to have a
different real name though.

97
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,710
He must have a real name.

98
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,544
What's his real name?

99
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,481
Wow.

100
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,450
His real name is Creflo
Augustus dollar junior.

101
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,680
Wow.

102
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,730
This is real fucking name.

103
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,130
It's got a bachelor of
science and education

104
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,110
south.

105
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,140
Their target shit.

106
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,760
Smacking people.

107
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,920
My favorite Robert Tilton,

108
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,783
you know he is,

109
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,200
he,

110
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,410
he probably seen him the,

111
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,270
there's a um,

112
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,230
a viral video of him farting.

113
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,610
Like he's like,

114
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,680
he talks to tons a lot on a show too.

115
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,693
He'll go,

116
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,950
it's hilarious.

117
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,760
See if he could pull up Robert Tilton
talking in tongues because it's some of

118
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,870
the most ridiculous shit ever.

119
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,980
But a one,

120
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,420
I'll never forget this
one thing that he said.

121
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:28,931
He said,

122
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,460
every time you write a check to me,

123
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,650
Satan gets a black.

124
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,173
Wow.

125
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,160
But it doesn't,

126
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:39,580
part of you think that if you're dumb
enough to to send him that money,

127
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:39,881
like,

128
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:40,714
so what?

129
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,390
So a guy got you with the
dumbest trick of all time.

130
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,490
Like you really thought that
money was going to gone.

131
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,890
You really thought that money is
going to give the devil a black guy.

132
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,730
If you really thought that you,

133
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,270
you're fucking stupid and
we're not looking after you.

134
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,760
Right?

135
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,280
One of the sky things that
this Peter Popoff does,

136
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,150
he also sends you a barley cake from,

137
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,390
you know the Bible where it's like
kind of like that little bread you eat.

138
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,430
And he goes,

139
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:03,710
ah.

140
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,120
He goes in this commercial,

141
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:09,830
he goes and we make it with the exact
ingredients that they say in the Bible and

142
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:09,981
Blah,

143
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:10,191
blah,

144
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:10,610
blah.

145
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,390
Well then if you look up his
zeal for 12 in the Bible,

146
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:15,020
it says,

147
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,070
and you should eat it as barley cakes
and bake it using fuel of human waste.

148
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,770
So human way.

149
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,010
So,

150
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,650
so in the,

151
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,071
wait a minute,

152
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:22,431
wait a minute.

153
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:23,264
When they know it does,

154
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,300

00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,081
you're,

170
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:38,280
you're thinking about the weed law,

171
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,740
but he killed for 12 hours since
I read up on my good old days.

172
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,550
He keels so this is all new to me.

173
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,340
Bake it with Dung that cometh
out of man in their sight.

174
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,180
Hold on a second or cooked with,

175
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,853
oh my God,

176
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,450
thou shalt bake it with Dung that
cometh out of man in their sight.

177
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,300
You mean to study the Bible
and Cook You bread with Shit?

178
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,280
Have you ever tried my purple barley cake?

179
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,530
You fucking imagine how dumb people are.

180
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,060
That really hurts my brain.

181
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,630
Do you know what [inaudible] might've
been a tripper cause the Zico was also

182
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:23,120
where the first depictions
of Ufos came from.

183
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,590
Here.

184
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,423
Let me pull that up.

185
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,390
[inaudible] was known for,

186
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,253
there's um,

187
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,423
there's a,

188
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,000
like a bible quote that
people bring up all the time.

189
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,811
We see a Ufo.

190
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:32,990
Oh,

191
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,050
I bet people were seeing a lot of
things after eating a bunch of shit.

192
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:36,770
Males,

193
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,720
they're eating fucking shit cakes all day,

194
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,831
throwing up.

195
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:43,160
Almost time it was a wheel within a wheel.

196
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:46,400
It was God's chariot guys with boats.

197
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:47,420
They had all the animals.

198
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,970
You think we should prepare the
barley cake in a different way?

199
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,331
No,

200
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:50,630
no.

201
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,463
It's great.

202
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,760
I'm kind of trying to find
what a stupid fucking culture.

203
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,140
Yeah,

204
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,200
I cook it with Shit.

205
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,591
Okay,

206
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,040
dad,

207
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,300
should I write that down on paper?

208
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,650
I fit something for my son because I
got so obsessed with this administered

209
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:03,801
that.

210
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,030
So when I found that out,

211
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,260
I,

212
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,350
I had tweeted something like olive
garden was like [inaudible] oh four 12 or

213
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:12,630
something like that and all these
people got pissed off that I was doing.

214
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,420
I didn't doing Bible scriptures.

215
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:14,751
Oh,

216
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,470
that's hilarious.

217
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,520
Well they read that though.

218
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,750
Yeah,

219
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,583
they figured it out.

220
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,400
How do you not read that
and just start laughing?

221
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,660
You telling me to Cook Shit.

222
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,200
Cakes.

223
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,800
Fuck.

224
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,450
The Bible says Cook Shit cakes.

225
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,430
That's just one more
dumb thing in the Bible.

226
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:25,991
God down.

227
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:28,070
I was so tired of people
pretending that book's awesome.

228
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,010
I'm so tired.

229
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,200
You stop that shit stupid.

230
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,831
Okay,

231
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:34,100
here.

232
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,620
Here's the,

233
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,280
here's a quote.

234
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,630
And I looked and behold,

235
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:38,310
a whirlwind came out of the north,

236
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,370
a great cloud and a fire enfolding itself
in brightness was about it and out of

237
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:50,391
the midst thereof as the color of
amber out of the midst of the fire.

238
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,051
Okay.

239
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:52,884
How was that Efl?

240
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,140
Hmm.

241
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,973
That's okay.

242
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,130
Somebody putting two points
together that don't go together.

243
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,620
Oh,

244
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,041
wait a minute.

245
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,420
This stuff.

246
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,180
Hold on.

247
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,960
Listen to this.

248
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,411
Also,

249
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:06,880
out of the midst thereof came the likeness
of four living creatures and this was

250
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:07,714
their appearance.

251
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,660
They had the likeness of a man woe.

252
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,860
After everyone had four faces in,

253
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:18,820
every one had four wings and their feet
were straight and the sole of their feet

254
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:24,030
was like the soul of a calf's foot and
they sparkled like the color of burnished

255
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:25,294
brass.

256
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,860
What a trippy book.

257
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,701
People are like,

258
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:28,091
oh my God,

259
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:28,924
it's so real.

260
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,450
I hear God's words when
you're saying these things,

261
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,460
God is speaking to me through your words.

262
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:34,300
Please run on.

263
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,540
And they had the hands of men under
their wings on their four sides and they

264
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:40,240
had,

265
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,800
and they four had their
faces and their waste.

266
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,680
Somebody might have just made all this
up and me like an asshole as reading

267
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,970
these fake Bible quotes shitting
all over the Bible and the aliens.

268
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,730
But guess what?

269
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,450
I don't care.

270
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:52,751
I'm not,

271
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm not reading any further.

272
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:54,460
It's,

273
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,050
it seems like if this is,

274
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,080
if this really is as
he kills it says it is.

275
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,033
God dammit.

276
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,940
It's all nuttiness.

277
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,980
They walked up with their
four faces and they said,

278
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:05,200
why are you guys cooking things in Shit?

279
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,160
And the living creatures ran in,

280
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,850
returned as the appearance
of a flash of lightning.

281
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,050
Now as I behold,

282
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:11,890
the living creatures,

283
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:16,690
behold one wheel upon the earth by the
living creatures with his four faces.

284
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,150
These guys were tripping hard eating shit.

285
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:19,640
Cakes.

286
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,200
Yeah,

287
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,033
losing their mind.

288
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,180
What grows on shit.

289
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,771
Mushrooms.

290
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:24,251
That's right.

291
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:24,761
Leave your shit.

292
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,770
Kicks out the cover with mushrooms.

293
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,030
Eat your shit cakes.

294
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,410
Chop your balls off.

295
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,300
Start talking nutty man.

296
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,280
When those went,

297
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,143
these went,

298
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,530
and when those stood still these stood
and when those were lifted up from the

299
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:39,040
earth,

300
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,180
the wheels were lifted up.

301
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,340
That guy is this gloss of Lelea.

302
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,120
That guy's just,

303
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,930
that's a word salad.

304
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:44,860
That guy's high as fuck.

305
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,450
He just rambling.

306
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,660
Highest fuck on shit.

307
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,510
The same thing in Joshua tree one time.

308
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,620
This is the stuff,

309
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:51,071
by the way,

310
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,150
that they kept in.

311
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,073
Okay.

312
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:15,963
Okay.

313
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,351
Oh,

314
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:24,184
it is already,

315
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,240
what the fuck's on?
