11
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:47,300

things are explained@onnit.com far better

12
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:49,400
than I'm going to be able to

But our goal is just to provide you
with all the different shit that we use.

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,250
Um, all the different things that I use
as far as like strength and conditioning

15
00:00:58,251 --> 00:01:02,550
equipment like kettlebells, things that
can improve athletic performance, um,

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,470
steel, maces and steel clubs. All
these different things are all, again,

17
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:10,160
explain far better at [inaudible] dot
com if you're a person who doesn't

18
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:12,560
exercise and you've never tried
anything like this before,

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,370
I cannot stress enough to take it lightly.
Start slow,

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,340
hire a trainer if you can
afford one and you just,

21
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,120
you don't need to do like
every workout with a trainer.

22
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:26,630
Just have somebody show you the
correct emotions, the correct way,

23
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:30,320
the correct form to do like various
physical exercises so that you don't hurt

24
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:31,750
yourself.
Because a,

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,510
the whole goal of exercise obviously
is to improve the way your body works.

26
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:39,860
And if you break it along the way, that
shit ain't improve and nothing. That said,

27
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,600
we sell a wide variety of
weights, um, of kettle bells.

28
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:49,600
We sell packages from like beginner
Kettlebell packages, which uh, have, uh,

29
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,740
three different weight sizes, 20
kilograms, 16 kilograms and 12 kilograms,

30
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,040
which are um, what is
20. He was at 35 out,

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,480
50 pounds to 44,
46 pounds.

32
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,180
Yeah. Um, I don't know
why we doing kilograms.

33
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,450
This is something that because they were
created in Russia, it's a would kill.

34
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,020
Kettle bells are, is an ancient
Russian method of lifting weights.

35
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,280
It's like a cannon ball with a handle on
it and and using momentum and swinging

36
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:20,750
these things that the goal
of the Kettlebell is to
strengthen the entire body as

37
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:25,010
one individual unit. Like a lot of times
when you see people lifting weights,

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,400
they do things like if you go
to the standard gym set up,

39
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,110
a lot of times people are doing what you
call isolation exercises like curls or

40
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:37,070
things along those lines.
Tricep extensions that are
really just working one,

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,400
one body muscle group.
Um,

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,080
and the idea behind something like
kettle is to work the entire body as one

43
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,370
individual thing.

44
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,450
So it strengthens the body all is
one unit and also enhances athletic

45
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:54,350
performance because of that, because if
you just get developed strong biceps,

46
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:55,970
like you're only working your bicep,

47
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:58,690
you're not working your legs and
your back at the same time, you're,

48
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,060
you're kind of doing yourself a disservice
because you're going to create an

49
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:04,750
imbalance. It's not natural to just
have really strong biceps for no reason.

50
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,830
It looks sexy while some
fucking guns with a beach kid,

51
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,530
but you're going to get hurt.
Um,

52
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,130
but we carry all the way up
to a very heavy cattle bells.

53
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:19,330
We just started getting some really
big ones. Then, um, we have, um,

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,280
the strong man kettle bells that just
came in, uh, which I think go up to 90,

55
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,620
48 kilograms. What the fuck is that?
It's over a hundred pounds. Yeah,

56
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,320
it's a lot of weight, bitch. It's too
much for you. Start slow workout. Uh,

57
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,700
just, just do it smart
please. Whatever you do.

58
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,570
I hear hearing people are just to build
because you should her fucking tore my

59
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,590
shoulder report.
Don't do that extra size.

60
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,940
Eat correctly.

61
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,970
Get your fucking shit together people
and start it all at Onnit Dotcom.

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,540
There's a wide variety of things
including workout DVDs. Uh, the,

63
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,970
I can't stress this one enough.
I talk about it all the time,

64
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,230
but it's just because it's so good.

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,010
The extreme kettlebell cardio workout
DVD by man named Keith Webber.

66
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,850
Keith will be here in October.
We're working out the dates right now.

67
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,410
I'm very psyched to sit
down and talk to him.

68
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:13,411
He's a good dude and he has a great
workout regimen that you can follow.

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,080
A also strength and conditioning. Besides
strength and conditioning equipment,

70
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,360
we have a massive amounts of supplements,

71
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:23,530
healthy foods including the hemp force
protein bar, a hem force protein bar,

72
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,370
which contains the finest quality
hemp protein, very delicious,

73
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,380
very low in fats. It's got healthy
fats, minerals, fiber, protein,

74
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,790
all pressed into a shape that's perfect
to just stuff in your pocket or your bag

75
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:41,570
and get the fuck out of there and have
healthy protein and have something that

76
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,671
fills your stomach up.

77
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:47,230
It doesn't make you feel like an asshole
for doing it on a Dotcom o. N n I.

78
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,880
T use the Codeword Rogan
and save yourself 10% off.

79
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,510
We're also brought to you by a new
sponsor and it's called me undies.

80
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,680
Why did they decide to call their
company? Me undies? I don't know man.

81
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,610
I don't know,

82
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,610
but the idea behind it is they have the
finest underwear that you can buy and

83
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:09,400
they will deliver it to you.
Order it online and have it sent to you.

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,850
I personally do not like
going to a store and shopping.

85
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:17,680
I don't like going shopping. Why
is that? Um, I dunno. It's just me.

86
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,900
I hate it too. It's not
fun. It's a chick thing.

87
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Chicks like chopping chicks like going
places and trying things on and I don't

88
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:28,600
know. What do you think? And
then they step out station.

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,040
I do almost all my shopping online now if
I can. I love it. Love shopping online.

90
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,980
And um,
me undies is a,

91
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,670
a company now that has the most
comfortable underwear you have ever tried.

92
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
They're fantastic underwear.
Does that, what does that mean?

93
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,890
If you ever had bad underwear?
Yes I have.

94
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,190
I've had weird underwear where you
cannot keep your balls from coming out of

95
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:55,570
that hole in the front.
Like what is that man figure that shit up.

96
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,030
That's wack underwear and black underwear,
really annoying.

97
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,150
But the me undies brand, they just
sent me a box of them two weeks ago.

98
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,073
They fit great.

99
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,610
They don't ride up on you and they
actually literally pull moisture away from

100
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,660
your skin so that your cool all day long.
Um,

101
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,650
so they've designed these
things like actually sat down
and thought about it. Um,

102
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,960
they're all working out of
a small warehouse in La.

103
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,390
They're not a bunch of
pretentious designers.

104
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,140
They don't take themselves too seriously
and they make their big great underwear,

105
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:28,040
great underwear. That looks great. If you
go to the [inaudible] a website though,

106
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,920
it'll confuse the shit out of you
as to what exactly they're doing.

107
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,470
If you go to the me on the website,
first of all,

108
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,100
everything is people in their underwear
walking around the street doing normal

109
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,290
things. Uh, which I don't recommend.

110
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:44,030
Like this one with these two guys
and their underwear with guns. Yeah.

111
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,610
What, what are you guys doing? Fuck.

112
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,050
Why are you guys in your underwear
with guns? What are you planning?

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,820
Wow. Fasten. Yeah. And
they also, not only,

114
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:59,330
it's so homoerotic they're not
just in their underwear with guns,

115
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,690
but the two guys have their shoulders,

116
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:06,740
like their elbows on the shoulder
of this other guy who has a gun.

117
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,180
You know,

118
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,260
if I was a psychologist and I was like
really deep into reading into shit,

119
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,470
I could go off on that.
Just one photograph.

120
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,960
Like what kind of a gang bang or
are you guys planning? You know,

121
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,960
it seems like one guy
has ear plugs on too.

122
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,930
I don't know what is Cammo Andy's on to.
Yeah.

123
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,280
And what are the things around their
necks? I was going to say something.

124
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,390
Those are your plugs for guns.
Big Guns. Okay. So they're just,

125
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,950
they're firing off guns in their
underwear. I don't recommend that ever.

126
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,920
I don't think you should shoot guns in
your underwear unless someone's breaking

127
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,720
into your house and you happen
to be in your underwear.

128
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,910
But it seems like these
dudes plan this shit out. Um,

129
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,430
I guess they just trying to let you
know that these are super comfortable

130
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,730
underwear and you can use them to
do anything. Uh, I support them.

131
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:59,780
I think they are excellent underwear
and a, if you go to meet undies.com,

132

136
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:17,750

the shit out of you. Most guys, uh,

137
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,190
when they were surveyed,

138
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,640
how long does it take before you change
your underwear or before you buy new

139
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:24,200
underwear?
How long do your underwear's last?

140
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,230
How long would you think I saw it on
seven years due to keep drawers for seven

141
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:33,860
fucking years.
Seven years of farts and Dick drippage.

142
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,400
Yeah,

See I grew up the house I grew up and
was named southern comfort real quick

185
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,480
while we're on the audible thing,
by the way, I wanted, I just was a,

186
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,930
I'm huge audio book fan.

187
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,350
I will tell you a a hilariously awesome
and creepy experience is at the highly

188
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:27,900
recommend if anyone has like an hour
and they're, they're your buddies thing.

189
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,520
They have listened to that book. Get
dianetics the audit. I'm serious, man.

190
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:36,930
It's so creepy. It's like being
a fucking Philip k Dick Movie.

191
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:39,480
It's like being in total
recall or is it really, oh man.

192
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,420
The way that the guy who reads it, the
whole thing and like the whole package.

193
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,630
It's so cool man. You're like, oh,

194
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:48,510
and then you know the read
the book commercials like
my whole life I had always

195
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:51,210
heard that shit and I was like, I'm
going to get the audio book of dianetics.

196
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,140
I bet that shit's wack and
highly recommended just for
wackiness for wackiness,

197
00:11:56,141 --> 00:12:00,370
but by the end of it you're like,
hmm. That's what's fucked up about it.

198
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,380
It's like the,
the concept of what,

199
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,620
because I guess dianetics like I kind
of assessed the Scientology because it's

200
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:12,280
so fucking retarded and in one sense
to me, but in the other sense like,

201
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,310
because it's so serious and
all the craziness you hear
about, so I've like read,

202
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,660
I've like really looked into it.

203
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,310
I'll Ron Hubbard and if you know about
Excalibur, do you know about that?

204
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,810
What does Excalibur, okay, he wrote,
he wrote a book called the Excalibur.

205
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,630
Supposedly the big rumor is,
is that this book,

206
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,130
there was like the foreshadowing
for Scientology and uh, and that,

207
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,460
that like he tried to get it published
and like three or four people that read

208
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:40,570
it committed suicide. So he locked
it and evolved and there's like,

209
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,510
I see of it and no one would
ever knows where that is.

210
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,390
But that was like where
Scientology was born from. So like,

211
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,800
I'm so fascinated by it. So like dianetics
was his new book like that he wrote,

212
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,810
he's like, wait, I've got
it figured out. Like it's,

213
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:55,560
it's more like this and kind of like,

214
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,520
it's a dianetics was kind of like the
way of introducing what was in the

215
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:02,800
Excalibur book too, like the mass
population. It's pretty fascinating.

216
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,880
That sounds like one of those, uh,
in the mouth of madness. Totally.

217
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:11,830
It's like the John Carpenter book where
love that the movie where the guy wrote

218
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:15,100
a book and a bunch of people were
killing themselves and going crazy and

219
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:19,720
murdering people. Sam Neil. Neil was
in it, right? Yeah, that was exactly,

220
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:23,460
that's what the whole rumor about it
is. And if you've seen the master, uh,

221
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,920
with uh, Phillip Seymour Hoffman when
he played like the l Ron Hubbard Guy,

222
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:31,921
he had a book in that it was called
like the sword or something instead of

223
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:34,600
Excalibur. But, but like, uh, yeah,

224
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,930
supposedly he like showed it to a bunch
of people and they like went crazy.

225
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:40,210
And apparently what the book is about,

226
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:42,970
and I don't mean to derail our entire
conversation in this direction,

227
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,820
but don't worry,
there's no derailing the conversation.

228
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,110
This is the kind of Shit I like
to talk about. I say like two man,

229
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,900
this supposedly there's, um,
what the whole concept was,

230
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,480
was about the mob mentality and
breaking that apart. So like that,

231
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,060
that no matter what everyone is,
is really always alone,

232
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,310
no matter if they're in a group,
but when they're in a group,

233
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:06,950
they act a certain way that's different.
So there's like, there's, there's,

234
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,460
it's supposedly there's a guy being hung,

235
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:12,220
there's a scene in it where there's a
guy being hung and then there's the mob

236
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:14,930
that wants him hung and
it goes and like analyzes,

237
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,300
like the people in the mob and the
analyzes the executioner analyzes the guy.

238
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,390
He's getting hung. Like, I dunno, you
know, I'm very fascinated with that,

239
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,370
that kind of like psychology and it's
one that's why the whole, you know,

240
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,660
uh, Scientology thing to me is
so fascinating because I'm like,

241
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,980
how do these people,

242
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,690
they pay money to join this fucking
club that's like, you know, real.

243
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:40,990
It's real like Aa and all that stuff in
the sense that it's like you know your

244
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:44,140
new friends and your old friends and they
have like they assigned people to you

245
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,720
and then eventually you kind of
weed out all those other people.

246
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,730
But the whole concept of it is,

247
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,790
is taking the whole concept of dianetics
is taking like when you're a little kid

248
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:58,310
and a dog bites you and then for the
rest of your life you're scared of dogs.

249
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,420
Like the whole concept behind dianetics
is that they can take the memory,

250
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,750
what they call a reactive memory,
which is like the dog thing,

251
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,550
and they can turn it into a like a regular
memory so that you won't like the get

252
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:10,791
rid,

253
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,420
get rid of all of those kind of little
things that fucked you up through life.

254
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,520
That's what the concept of Cleary is.
So that when those things become,

255
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,530
you're not reactive anymore.
So if like you're,

256
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,490
you hate your dad and then for that reason
you like react certain way to people

257
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,890
your whole life. Like you cannot
even get that out of there.

258
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:30,590
So you'll never like act and calm,
you know what I mean?

259
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,640
But then you have to pay them a lot of
money to have an auditor to go through

260
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,710
your life and figure all
that shit out for you.

261
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:38,300
That's where they make all their cash.

262
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,990
Well the give you give them a certain
percentage of your income. Right.

263
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,660
It's just like tithing,
tithing in a regular church.

264
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,080
I think you give them 10% especially
at the highest levels. Really.

265
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,780
I didn't even know that timing is a big
one. That's a big one with religion.

266
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,670
That's the way they get shy. Well, I knew
that, I knew that when the other ones,

267
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:59,030
but I didn't know that there was a, there
was like a tithing process. I, I didn't,

268
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,210
I know that they do a lot of things.
Like I used to rehearse, I've been here,

269
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,670
I wouldn't live in here for 15 years.
And my old band,

270
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:08,420
we used to rehearse on Hollywood and vine
in this place and there was a daycare

271
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:12,650
next door and someone told us later,
Hollywood and vine. Yeah, right.

272
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,120
Oh Shit. Right. And it was
like, do you remember? Well,

273
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:17,630
you know it's right across the street
from the l Ron Hubbard exhibit and all

274
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:21,890
that. And uh, and somebody was like, yeah,

275
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:25,210
that's a Scientology daycare. They're
like real hush hush about it. But it's,

276
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:29,390
it's Scientology. So like, you know, like
there are a lot of that shit going down.

277
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,010
I'm probably gonna get murdered tonight.
Scientology's becomes such a joke.

278
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,880
I know, I know. Last few years, if this
was 20 years ago, you'd have an issue,

279
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:41,990
but the internet is sort of expose
them in a way that's made them seem so

280
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:46,310
preposterous. Like seriously
preposterous. It's funny though,

281
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,290
they have that big, a psychiatry
kills thing to that big exhibit.

282
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,020
Is that on sunset too? Or is it,
where are the fuck is that hey,

283
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:57,740
is that what that is? Yeah, that's
exactly what that is. It's, it's on,

284
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,480
is it unsensitive or Hollywood?

285
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,750
Because there was a mock store that I buy
hard drives and I saw that it must the

286
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:07,300
street. I didn't know that was a, wow,

287
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,550
I've got to go in there and check that
out because they don't believe in that.

288
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:11,670
And they don't believe a lot of medicines,

289
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:14,280
but in in certain ways like I can sign it.

290
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,330
I kind of see their point in certain
ways. Like, I mean I've been,

291
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,580
I've talked to psychologists
before in my life.

292
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,200
I mean I went to one for like
relationship counseling and,

293
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:27,560
and of course like it becomes like they
want to talk about you and I'm like,

294
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,820
I'm the kind of guy,
he's like,

295
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,490
I don't like whatever problems
and issues I've had in my life.

296
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:33,160
I worked through them. I
got, I've never need it.

297
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,570
I've never seen the need to really
kind of, I don't know. I'm not,

298
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm like an angry guy. There's not shit
I'm angry at from when I was little.

299
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,720
I've kind of dealt with all that,
you know what I mean?

300
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,800
So sometimes when I see Scientology,
like Tom Cruise being like,

301
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,920
screw all that stuff, I'm like, yeah,
Tom Cruise is like, that's cool.

302
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,040
Even though you're weird, you know, you
invited him to your show yesterday. To me,

303
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,610
we're right in line. It's
like you, you do come on down,

304
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,730
come on down. Tom Cruise. Don't want to
talk to you about your fucking magic.

305
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,250
I was like Joe Rogan and I was
real serious about the other three.

306
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,700
Billy Ray Cyrus and Marilyn Manson.

307
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,560
It's like come on down like Tom Cruise.
That would be odd if he showed up.

308
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,830
It would have been awesome. And he
had talked to him. Stop being so Glib.

309
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,350
Have you seen the guy on and I'm,

310
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,780
I'm supposed to not like
this guy because he did.

311
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:26,040
He did dis my best friend and manager,
which is not cool. But besides that,

312
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,680
previous to that, when before it got
sticky, there's a guy on Twitter named,

313
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:32,910
not Tom Cruise. Do you know this kind
of no dude, he's hilarious. He can.

314
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,890
He just talks about,
he's like blowing rails.

315
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,780
Was Britney Spears all
day long and drive down.

316
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,990
He just talking about being on coked
out his phone and like how he's like

317
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:43,920
Scientology rules and he's like looking
for bitches and like hanging out with,

318
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:47,980
you know, Travolta and doing rails and
shit. He keeps graduating. He's like,

319
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,990
I think that their stance
against psychiatry, it's,

320
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,360
they've got some good points,
but there's,

321
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,690
it's like all things this probably,

322
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:59,640
it's not a complete black and white issue.

323
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:04,641
It's not like psychiatric drugs are all
bad or that antidepressants are all bad

324
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,510
because I personally know people that
were like close to suicide. Yes. Oh yeah,

325
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:13,050
I agree. I agree with that too. I
think that that, that stuff is good.

326
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,500
It can be good, can be bad. It can also
be a crutch, you know, in that way.

327
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:19,860
And I think a lot of times, man, here's
the, here's the thing, I have it,

328
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,750
like one of my dearest
friends guy work for me,

329
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:22,860
I'm not trying to be a downer with this,

330
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,380
but his brother has got fair in
Miller who actually co right.

331
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,090
One of the songs on this
George record and dude,

332
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:30,420
I walked out of my house without my
vinyls. I have a stack of vinyls for you.

333
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,490
So we've got this means we
have to hang out. Oh, hang
out man. To be happy too. Um,

334
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,430
but, uh, Faron Miller cowrote
uh, living in a minor key,

335
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:42,810
which was on the George record and,
and Ferran worked for me for nine years.

336
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,120
Still does, but he's in a band
now and he's doing awesome.

337
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,160
His brother was on those,

338
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,250
those medicines and stopped
hard like cold Turkey Woo.

339
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,980
Cause it went just crazy. You know
what I mean? So like you have to like,

340
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,720
you have to really,
really be responsible with psych.

341
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,030
Like those kinds of drugs that
change your mental, you know,

342
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,380
and sometimes like you said,

343
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,100
sometimes it does wonders for people
and it changes their life and then

344
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:11,070
sometimes it can be really damaging.
So, you know, you have to be careful.

345
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:15,150
But at the same time, Scientology,
they're like no drug stance. Like,

346
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,390
I don't know. Yeah, I don't
think that's responsible either.

347
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,540
I think there's a reason why they've come
up with a lot of these drugs and some

348
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,860
people have benefited tremendously.

349
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:26,160
There's people that just have natural
chemical imbalances in their brain.

350
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,050
And the idea that someone who doesn't
know how your brain works can say,

351
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,690
you know, Oh, you don't need
it because I don't need it.

352
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,660
You don't need it because Mike doesn't
need a Tom cruise doesn't need it.

353
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,980
So you know, John, fuck over here. He
doesn't need it either. That's crazy.

354
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:45,900
Some people benefit from tremendously
and sometimes they can use,

355
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,740
you can use those things as a bridge.

356
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,600
He got really tough times in your life.

357
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,840
You can use the psychiatric drugs as a
bridge and then get to a healthy place

358
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,850
and then wean yourself off.
Get your life in order.

359
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,190
I've read stuff about
people doing that too.

360
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,140
I don't necessarily think they're all bad,

361
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:06,760
but I think that there's a lot of people
that don't take care of themselves and

362
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:09,400
then just to get depressed and just
take a pill and then now they're better.

363
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,960
Well maybe not.

364
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,730
Maybe you would have been better off if
you start eating better and maybe stop

365
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,980
drinking as much and doing a little
bit of exercise every now and then and

366
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:21,840
probably you'd feel better.
It would help. You know? So I,

367
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,590
and also the t the Scientology thing,

368
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:28,591
like we see a guy like Tom Cruise who
is undeniably wacky but also undeniably

369
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,780
successful. The guy is,
uh, always positive.

370
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,290
Like he does his interviews, he's got a
lot of great energy and it's like, man,

371
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,900
there's a benefit to that.
There's definitely something to that.

372
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,620
I ended,
there's definitely something to that.

373
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:46,010
And especially when you get a guy who was
in that much, I mean, that much power.

374
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:48,500
And has that, has that had that
much success? You know, an,

375
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,450
it has that much influence. Like, I
mean, you know, either they're like,

376
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:57,530
I know that they treat him like,
like he's the, he's the, you know, l,

377
00:21:57,531 --> 00:22:02,030
Ron Hubbard junior or something. So I'm
sure he, he's loving that side of it.

378
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:06,050
But the reality is, is like he, for
him to have stuck by it, I mean,

379
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,590
there's gotta be something
to, I mean, like I said,

380
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,870
that [inaudible] the audio book of
Dianetics as funny as that is, it is,

381
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:15,620
it is so fascinating because it explains
why he's always a fucking good mood all

382
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:19,790
the time. He's like, he's like, I'm
really good at this clear thing. You know?

383
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:20,061
He's like,

384
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:23,300
he's really figured it out and he's like
really happy all the time and nothing,

385
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,540
you know,
who knows?

386
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,670
He might be or you know,

387
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,700
he might just shut the door when the
day is done and it's fucking whale cream

388
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,080
and fucking fish all over the ground,
flopping around like a fucking animal.

389
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,790
I mean, you know guys like that. Right?

390
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,520
I have a couple of friends where I'm
like somebody getting beat somewhere on

391
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:44,220
this guy because they're so nice,
you know,

392
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:47,340
somewhere he's gone on pack
a punch in Soda, lights out.

393
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,940
Well there's people that you can tell
they're holding back and you could tell.

394
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:54,300
Yeah, okay. All right, fine. You know, and
you'd tell as soon as this guy gets away,

395
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:56,070
he's going to fucking do something crazy.

396
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,030
There's some people that are actually
calm and then there's some people you can

397
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:01,740
tell they're keeping it together,

398
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,110
but there's a monster inside
just raging at the cage. No,

399
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,560
fucking get out. Yeah.
That's uncomfortable when
you, you like, you know,

400
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,960
if you tried to explain to
someone, you're like, well listen,

401
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,050
everything you said was good. He, uh, he
used all the right words. He was very,

402
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,410
but I knew this motherfucker was hating
it inside side and they'd be like, oh,

403
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:26,400
that's just your perception, sir. I
mean, you can't prove that. No you can't.

404
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:31,110
But everybody knows that one dude
that's like that. Yeah, of course, man.

405
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,870
It's like, yeah, that's so
funny. It's true though.

406
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,830
My next door neighbor in my old house
was a scientologist. He's a nice guy.

407
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,700
Super Nice Guy. Why be a scientologist
when you're just some guy?

408
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,150
Like that's what I want to know. Cause
they worship actors and they worship.

409
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,320
So why I think they worship to actors
and they worship artists because that

410
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,120
influences others to become
Scientologists. I think
that's the strategy, right?

411
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,780
I mean, yeah, and they, and they,
you know, they kinda deify like,

412
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,940
like anyone who does any kind of art
has kind of a superior being. Well,

413
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,330
in a way, look, listen, okay.
I'm a shooter Jennings Fan. If a,

414
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:12,190
if I found out that shooter Jennings
is really into Scientology, I go, oh,

415
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:15,180
well that guy is cool, man, man,
the fuck is up with this. That'd be,

416
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,620
then he started reading into
it and you'd go, oh, I see.

417
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:23,270
So it keeps him positive and that keeps
putting out badass music. Oh, okay.

418
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,590
Okay. Maybe I'm fucking try
this. And that's all you
need. Like Scientology, man,

419
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,130
look, Tom Cruise is a bad motherfucker.
Okay. Tom Cruise doesn't take any drugs.

420
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,160
Tom Cruise drinks water every day.
Tom Cruise runs marathons.

421
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,280
Tom Cruise is a fucking beast.
I want to be like Tom Cruise.

422
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,270
And next thing you know,

423
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:41,210
you're fucking holding onto these
Campbell soup cans that are attached with

424
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:45,370
little wires and they're
honoring you. Yes. Have you
ever done that? No, I got it.

425
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,900
Yeah, I did it really well. I'll do it
with you. I would love to do it and I, I,

426
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,440
I'll do it in a heartbeat. I don't know
if they would take me and now, I mean,

427
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,800
you'd have to have someone who doesn't
know who you are and, right, right.

428
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,990
I definitely found a
dude who didn't know why,

429
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:01,640
who the guy was in his late fifties.

430
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,120
You just walk in and I was the
one that was on in um, San Diego.

431
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,200
I was down there filming for this TV
show that I was doing on CBS called the

432
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,230
game show in my head when we put these
little earpieces in someone so I could

433
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:17,960
talk to them. And then I gave them
like tasks that they had to go do.

434
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,200
Like they had a sell water to
people that came out of a hose.

435
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:25,300
Like they had to do a bunch of, like when
I did it convince people to, to tell, uh,

436
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,830
they had to play a fake news reporter
and convince people to tell them they'd

437
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,620
been abducted by aliens and all this
different Shit. But why we were there,

438
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:34,460
we're filming,

439
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,820
they had this dinette set up because it
was in this outside public place or a

440
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:39,080
lot of foot traffic was,

441
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,650
so they had the dinette set up and they
had their ear meteor or whatever they

442
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,800
call it. Is that what they call
it? And it's like two cans.

443
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,760
It looks like to like things that you
look like a Campbell soup can that you

444
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:54,070
took the wrapper off and it's connected
with these strings and so to really,

445
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,910
yeah, we'll soup can with
the yarn, hold onto this.

446
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:03,410
And so I did it and the guy wasn't very
compelling. He wasn't that good at it.

447
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,260
But, uh, I,

448
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,180
I got to ask him all sorts of questions
and read into it and it gave me some

449
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:11,640
brochures or something like that. Tried
to get me to go down there. What, what,

450
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,760
what, when he did the auditing though?
I mean, do they w how far did they,

451
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,441
they don't really,

452
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm sure because they're
trying to convince somebody
to come back that they're

453
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:20,960
not going to start delving into like
real personal shit. But I'm sure like,

454
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,600
like what do you do? What kind
of questions they don't remember.

455
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:26,380
Cause it was very unremarkable.
I remember it was big,

456
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,520
which is part of the problem,

457
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,310
which is why I was willing to do it in
the first place because otherwise I would

458
00:26:32,311 --> 00:26:36,110
have probably just hovered and watch other
people do it. But, uh, I just, you know,

459
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:37,190
it was dumb questions,

460
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:40,520
like dumb questions about your childhood
or you're happy with your career,

461
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:43,080
you know, you're happy in your
relationship. Right. You know,

462
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:44,310
and they just get a reading

463
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,190
on you allegedly from this nonscientific,
you know,

464
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,410
measuring instrument.
It's just so wacky, wacky.

465
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,280
So I see we could spend the whole thing
talking about this because it's so,

466
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,400
it's one of those things where like,
there's a bunch of people in on a joke,

467
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,180
you know, and you're like, just wanting
someone to say, okay, we're just fucking,

468
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,680
but no one does. You know what I
mean? Well, those belief systems,

469
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:11,490
the thing about having
those belief systems is that
they're very empowering for

470
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:15,720
people who believe in him. Like if you,
if you look at it and go, wait a minute,

471
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:20,340
wait a minute. Fucking planet. Xenu
really? Yeah. You know, Shit's insane.

472
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,050
Like I'm reading about this after you
brought up Excalibur while you're talking

473
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:29,190
about, and I pulled up that website,
that mock Scientology's you new.net. Oh,

474
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,680
I've never been there. But
this, oh my favorite site.

475
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,220
They have everything they have.
They have the entire Scientology like,

476
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,620
like Whoa, everything about what they
believe. All of the operating things,

477
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:45,670
male wiki leaks and was looking at that
is operating the operating Payton's

478
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,730
manual like level three,

479
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:52,440
which is apparently where I guess Tom
Cruise is like four or five or six or

480
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:55,680
something. But he was three a couple of
years. Like they have different manuals,

481
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:58,620
you know. So he was three a
couple of years ago and now
he's four or five or six.

482
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:01,530
I don't know where he's at and I haven't
been keeping up with his level what

483
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:04,800
rank he is at, but I know he's
ranked up because they've given him,

484
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,660
they made up some new award for him.

485
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,010
Did you ever see that video that leaked
when he's like using all this stuff that

486
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:13,740
was like they made up this one, they made
up this thing they'd never had before.

487
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,060
It was a guardian of the galaxy. Can
they like gave it to him and he was like,

488
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,080
he's like saying all that shit that made
no sense and using all their words and

489
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:26,190
stuff. Yeah, the Internet and people
put music to it and she had gorgeous,

490
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,490
it's so good to work of art. It is. It
is, man. I mean almost, it is almost like,

491
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,560
like something that you would,

492
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,930
you'd see from some artists who's doing
so I'm like fucking piece where he's

493
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,330
going on, man, that'd be so brilliant.

494
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:43,020
It's like he just all of a sudden
flipped and told everybody I've been just

495
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,610
listening.
It helps my acting.

496
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,670
If I can pretend to really be
into Scientology for this long.

497
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:49,780
It's like the dumb dumber me,
the new one coming out.

498
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:53,160
It'd be seen the preview for, oh my
god, it's genius. But there's like a,

499
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:56,350
there's like a whole thing where
Jim Carey character's care. Carrie,

500
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,320
Carrie's character is like in an insane
asylum. Go over this over that chick,

501
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:04,770
the Mary Samsonite as they called him
from the first one and then it turns out

502
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:09,540
he was like joking like for like
20 years and yet Lloyd Lloyd,

503
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:13,200
you mean to tell me that you've been,
you've been faking for 20 years,

504
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:17,910
all for a gag. And he's like, Yep.
It's like, that would be amazing.

505
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:20,280
If he did that, that's the only
way a good politician would work.

506
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,790
The only way that you could
have a president in this
country that was actually

507
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:27,090
going to care about the people is
they'd have to lie their way from the

508
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:28,380
beginning to the amendment.

509
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:31,860
They get an office and they didn't have
to flip and then you would have to also

510
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:34,140
have a cabinet that was in on the lie.

511
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,830
Like you don't have to have everybody
with you that was working with you. Like,

512
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:39,030
okay,
we're just fucking around.

513
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:42,040
We're going to get in there and
we're going to change and say that

514
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,420
would never,
you'd never be able to get it.

515
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:45,360
You'll never be able to
trust another person. Yeah.

516
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,400
I think the system is so far rig
though that it doesn't matter. Oh yeah.

517
00:29:50,401 --> 00:29:54,490
Yeah. Obviously because it's the same.
People are like just, we're running it.

518
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:58,330
I mean it's, it's like, you
know, it's like whoever's
who, you know, when they had,

519
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,280
when windows 95 had the fucking start me
up and the rolling stones and now like

520
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,980
whatever their commercials are like
now it's the same fucking company.

521
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:08,470
It just looks different and
everything, you know? Right. Yeah.

522
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:13,300
I think it's silly when people are like,
I think voting is silly.

523
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,550
This is, this is my whole thing
with that. Because it's like,

524
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,920
what is the fucking difference? Like first
of all, there's people who are like, so,

525
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:24,000
I mean I, I may be going against a
lot of people's opinions of this, but,

526
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,900
but like people who are so gung Ho on
these certain politicians and lobbying for

527
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:32,410
this person and they're like so excited
that Obama is going to like fucking

528
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:35,120
change everything. And it's
such, I mean, yeah, it's awesome.

529
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,780
Like our first black president.
That's awesome. But otherwise,

530
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:41,110
like it's the same fucking game.
Same Shit over and over.

531
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,740
So I look at people who are like
really gung ho about one guy. I'm like,

532
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:49,440
are you fucking crazy? Like
you're buying this? I mean, I,

533
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,620
nobody's bought anything for, so I mean
like, you know, like Bill Clinton goes on,

534
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:57,790
you know, Arsenio Hall like that change,
like, did you watch that nineties thing?

535
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:00,130
That, that has been unnatural
geographic recently. There's,

536
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:05,260
there's a series called the 90s and it's
like six hours the whole thing and I

537
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:08,170
sat and watched it one day
and it's awesome, but it, it,

538
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,030
it really reminds you how much shit you
weren't paying attention to in the 90s

539
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:15,100
and how rigged it all was like everything.

540
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:17,050
Like it was solid wood bin Ladin was on,

541
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:22,060
like they did an interview with him
and like 98 or 96 when was Oj 94 yeah,

542
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,250
it was right around there. I don't
remember if it was, if it was Oj,

543
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:32,080
I don't remember if it
was Oj or Monica Lewinsky,

544
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:37,000
but one of those things was going on at
the moment and 400,000 people watch this

545
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:41,200
interview with sound in line and he's
like, he says on the interview, he's like,

546
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:44,710
we're going to fuck you and you're going
to watch it on TV and you're going to

547
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:48,610
be crying when it happens. And in like
400 people watched it and nobody cared.

548
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,390
And like at the exact moment they were
airing it is when like Monica Lewinsky or,

549
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:56,530
or Oj was like in the prime and everyone's
like looking over here while like

550
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,371
this guy over here,

551
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:00,940
I know Sam has just as fucking bull
shitty is fucking the presidents and

552
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:04,870
everything. Like, like yeah, right,
like Osama did not fly that plane.

553
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:08,320
I mean there's some people that did that
shit and there are people involved and

554
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:11,740
we will never know the truth about
any of it. So I mean, no matter how,

555
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:14,380
how hard we dig, you know
what I mean? So it's like,

556
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:17,350
to me it all seems so silly when
people get so riled up. Like they,

557
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:19,090
they believe they have to believe.

558
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:21,940
So it's like satanism you have to
believe in God to be a satanist.

559
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,760
That seems so stupid to me.
Like you have to be Christian.

560
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,180
If you want to be in this Church of Satan,
you have to be a Christian first.

561
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,900
Cause then you have to believe that whole
thing to believe that there is a Satan

562
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:34,990
to join the Church of say it. And that's
a silly it. Is that true? Yeah. Well,

563
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:35,231
I mean,

564
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:39,350
I thought though that satanism like
really in its finest form was really just

565
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,184
about hedonism.

566
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,310
Well, yeah, that's true pleasure

567
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,330
of like of see,

568
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:51,110
I mean there's like Sally the Crowley
Church and there's like the kind of like

569
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:53,330
the [inaudible] church, which is
what you're kind of talking about,

570
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:54,650
which is just essentially like,

571
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,900
like do anything you hedonism
essentially. Yes, but,

572
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:02,900
but like the writings and the teachings
and the in the things that that where

573
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:04,910
they reference Satan as an,
you know,

574
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:08,510
and they all those kind of like rituals
and shit or silly because it's like

575
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:11,600
you've got to be in the frame of reference
of Christianity and the Bible and all

576
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:14,000
that. You know what I mean?
If it was really scary,

577
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:17,120
it'd be something you've never heard of
and some creature you've ever heard of

578
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:21,200
and you're like, be terrified. You know?
It's not the same bad guy from the Bible,

579
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,420
which is going to make it into a thing,
you know?

580
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,010
That's why it all seemed so silly.

581
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:28,520
It's just you got to believe in magic
and fairy tales and shit to make it all

582
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:31,080
happen. Well, you kind of do have
to believe in magic and fairytales.

583
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,310
We believe a guy like Obama was
kind of fix the country. Yes.

584
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,520
This system is so beyond rigged.
It's,

585
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:41,750
and it's so transparently rigged. Yes.
You have to end if to fix the system,

586
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:44,090
you have to end banking,
you have to end the Federal Reserve,

587
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:47,240
you have to get the corporations out
of control of the media and everything.

588
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:47,720
I mean,

589
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,980
and representative government and the
influence of representative government by

590
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:54,140
special interest groups and lobbyists.
Yeah.

591
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:59,141
You'd have to completely revamp everything
system that's just completely broken.

592
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,010
There's nothing working about it.
And it's so,

593
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:09,011
there's so many like fucked up pieces
of it that as it trickles down from the

594
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,800
top to the bottom, it's just,
you know how like I'm one water,

595
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,380
like water goes through, uh, when you,

596
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:17,810
when you see springs like
natural springs that come out,

597
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,250
that water's going through all this
rock and all this, this ground.

598
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,500
And in doing so,
it filters everything out.

599
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:27,230
So the water comes out really
pure and delicious to drink.

600
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,420
But it could start out, you
know, really fucked up. And
then it all gets true. Well,

601
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:34,610
the opposite is true with politics.

602
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:38,440
Like you could have a great idea and
you could have someone who, you know,

603
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:40,340
have someone who has great intentions,

604
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,840
but by the time they get through
the filter of corporations
and special interest

605
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:49,841
groups and lobbyists and this and
that and put it comes out empty,

606
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,310
it's like there's nothing left.

607
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,430
It's always going to do that because
it was all they want it to be that way.

608
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:59,450
You know that to me, like you said,
it's, it's so fucked up and it really is.

609
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,020
It's really because of that that night,
you know,

610
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:06,710
the 99% or the one percenters thing,
it's, I mean because you just had these,

611
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:10,100
you just, the corporations have
too much control and they've,

612
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:14,120
they're like the net neutrality thing and
trying to cut that out and that's like

613
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,800
their tribe. They're literally giving all
the power to like know Viacom and shit.

614
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:22,030
Like not only that Viacom is the,

615
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,880
any time you look at a
corporation as an individual,

616
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:27,320
which is what they keep trying to do.

617
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,330
They're doing that as far as their ability
to donate to political campaigns are

618
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:36,350
doing it as far as like
their responsibilities. Like
they're, they look at their,

619
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,610
they're trying to look at corporations

620
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,310
as if these entities should
be a given rights, like a,

621
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,660
an individual given rights,
like a human being. But that's,

622
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,710
that's crazy because in
doing so you're also doing,

623
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:53,130
when you have a corporation is you
dissolve the responsibility of each

624
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,380
individual for the actions of the group,
right?

625
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,800
If you're going to give corporations the
responsibilities or if you're going to

626
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:01,650
give corporations the
rights of an individual,

627
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,330
you should also be able to charge every
individual in the corporation as if they

628
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,990
were guilty for anything that the
corporation is in trouble for. Right?

629
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:11,100
And if you did that,

630
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,480
then it would change the actions entirely
of the corporation. Because right now,

631
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,640
like say if you,
you are part of a corporation.

632
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:21,990
This corporation likes to go to Guatemala
and build cell phones and in the

633
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:26,991
meantime you fucking shoot rabbits and
fucking poisoned the wells and you know

634
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,710
who knows what kind of horrible and anti
human shit they're doing in these third

635
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,860
world countries and
pollution and genocide and,

636
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,590
and it does have a group of people
that doesn't want them to clear cuts.

637
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,220
So they fucking gone these people down.

638
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,440
Then you find out about it all later
and everyone involved in the corporation

639
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,040
should be responsible for it and that's
the only way you would ever stop any of

640
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:51,810
that shit from going on. If you, if
you looked at BP perfect example,

641
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,740
the, the, the, the, the
oil spill in the Gulf,

642
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:59,040
which just fucked up
so many people's lives.

643
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,530
I mean there's so many people
that don't have a voice.

644
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,320
You're not hearing from the fishermen,
you're not healing.

645
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,410
Hearing from the people that had to clean
that shit up and not healing from the

646
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:09,150
people that lived in the
towns and close to the water,

647
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:12,930
they got really sick because of the
dispersants. There's so many individuals.

648
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,260
If everyone in BP was prosecuted as
fully responsible for the actions of BP,

649
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,060
I mean man, shit could get crazy. Yeah.
Like literally every single executive,

650
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,320
every single war,
everybody.

651
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:29,620
I think that's part of a corporate that
you can think of. Phrases subsidize.

652
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,540
That's what's even crazier. Oil
is subsidized, you know, the, the,

653
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,780
the amount of fuckery that's involved
when you get heavy duty money involved in,

654
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:44,370
in corporations and those corporations
have influence on politics and they have

655
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:47,640
influence on the way laws are formed
and structured the way our society

656
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,730
functions. It's just, it's
madness. It's madness.

657
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,140
And I don't know what the solution is,
but until you,

658
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,810
until you figure out a way to,

659
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,790
to not have these big groups of people
that have this disk diffusion of

660
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,600
responsibility. And now
because of your, you know,

661
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,570
shooter Jennings is a part of BP and BP
does something fucked up and you're like,

662
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:12,420
man, that's fucked up. I can't
believe my company did that.

663
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:15,300
But oh well I got a raise.
I didn't do anything.

664
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:18,780
You can sleep tight knowing that
you didn't do anything personally,

665
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,320
but you're a part of a machine that did
something that they really fight was

666
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,450
held accountable for that. I'd be
so pissed. I'd be like, you know,

667
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,250
like it'd be beyond that. I mean,
exactly. That's, that's fascinating.

668
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,440
That's fascinating point.
I mean,

669
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,740
right that all of these companies that
the courts are in the favor of the

670
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,340
corporations usually

671
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,440
and it's like the like I can't believe
three companies own 80% of them of all

672
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:44,510
television or something like that.

673
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:49,770
And in the 80s it was like 60 companies
and now it's three and it's like just,

674
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,040
and you just look at the way that the
world is, the way that we react to, to,

675
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,430
to the media, the way we react to this
shit like that, you know? I Dunno. It's,

676
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:00,400
it's amazing and feels,

677
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:03,970
it did feel like when we were younger
that like with things like the BP oil

678
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:06,970
spill happened and stuff like I think if
that happened now that we wouldn't hear

679
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:07,804
about it.

680
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,300
What do you mean? I mean oil
spill happened was how long ago?

681
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,550
EAP was just a couple of years ago.
That was like 10 years ago. No,

682
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,370
yeah, it was four years
ago. Was thought. Nevermind.

683
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,870
The big one was a,

684
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:29,290
the Exxon Valdez that happened in
1988 one we heard it was a big one.

685
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,990
That was a big one, which is by
the way, that area is still fucked.

686
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,780
Of course it is 1988 and they killed
off a massive amount of salmon and the

687
00:39:36,781 --> 00:39:40,600
battery is about to come out of there.
The best rate.

688
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:45,810
But then there's people like you and I
that drive cars and you know need gas and

689
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:48,790
you know, you buy an iPhone and how's it
going to fucking get to the apple store?

690
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,850
Someone's got to put that bitch in a
truck and it's got to drive it over there.

691
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,030
No other way.
You know the whole system has just,

692
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,240
it's been set up without a whole lot
of foresight. Like they, you know,

693
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:04,320
it was set up to deal with
what's available right now
and no one sort of saw the

694
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:07,660
future of how things are
going to get ugly and where,

695
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:11,770
where it could become problems and the
fast how much carbon he can get into the

696
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:14,350
air until it starts fucking
with the weather. And you know,

697
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:20,090
it's just so much and then there's so
much momentum also once like the thing

698
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:25,981
about like politics and the thing
about the influence of corporations and

699
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:30,310
special interests groups is that it's
sort of been this way for so long that to

700
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:31,760
come in now and try,

701
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,230
it's almost like there's a train running
through your neighborhood. John, John,

702
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:36,690
John, John, John, John, John, Matt,

703
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,060
and it's just training like we've got
to stop this train. Do you grab it?

704
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,140
Like how do you hold onto it? Well we
need to do is put some stuff on the track.

705
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,430
What's going to run over that stuff?

706
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,310
Well how the fuck do you stop the train
when you got to grab the back and put a

707
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:50,380
lot of weight on it?
Is that gonna work? No.

708
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:55,381
Well that all the things that we're
doing to try to like to reform politics,

709
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,190
like from an individual point of view,

710
00:40:57,191 --> 00:41:00,370
whether it's complaining about it
online or writing blogs or doing this,

711
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:04,760
and it's akin to trying to grab a
hold of the back of the train, dig

712
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,280
your heels. I mean, yes, I agree.

713
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,230
The only way to deal with his move where
though Iceland or somewhere, I don't,

714
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,640
I don't mean like moving to USA. I mean
in a metaphor. I mean kind of like,

715
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,510
like don't you feel like,
I mean,

716
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:23,030
I feel like the only out of the people
that I've kind of read and research that

717
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:24,920
are kind of like this
antiestablishment shit,

718
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:29,240
it seems to be that if they tell
you, you know, you've gotta,

719
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,270
you've gotta do this now you've
got to wear a blue shirt every day.

720
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:36,380
And the only way, the way to, to, to
fight any of it is just by not doing it.

721
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:38,870
You know what I mean?
Like just, just whatever.

722
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:43,871
But at this point in time that they've
convinced this entire country and they've

723
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:46,610
convinced the entire world,
this is how things work.

724
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:49,730
And you'd have to go along with it,
like jump jobs and you know,

725
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,200
they liked the fact they keep,

726
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:54,200
they liked the fact that
everyone is freaking out about
money all the time. They,

727
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:59,370
they squeezed the middle and lower
class out of that, you know, it was the,

728
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:02,780
they're freaked out all the time that
the both parents are having to work all

729
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:07,310
the time. The kids are in Shitty
daycares with education is terrible.

730
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:10,820
And it's like they, that's how they keep
that and control, you know what I mean?

731
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,290
But most people just walk through life
and accept that and just say that's the

732
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,910
way it is. And, and you know, it's,

733
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:20,300
it's very few people that actually stand
up and try and figure something else

734
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:22,270
out, but there's not really
a solution, especially that,

735
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,700
that someone like me can give
anyone. But, but at the same time,

736
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:30,320
like I can sit back and look at it and
comment on it because like with the black

737
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:33,110
ribbons record, that was
my way, you know, my,

738
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,310
my getting like it was right when the,
uh,

739
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,400
the economy fell in
2009 the very beginning.

740
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:45,620
And it had gone to 2008 2009 and George
Bush was missing and Obama was looking

741
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:48,980
real glorious at the time.
And,

742
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:52,370
but nobody was doing anything
about the collapse of the economy.

743
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:55,100
And then the bank bailouts were
happening and it was just like, man,

744
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:58,790
this is insane. It was like the
scariest little point of time, you know?

745
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,430
And that's kind of where
that album came out of. And,

746
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,960
and for me it was really my comment on
the whole thing and by having Steven King

747
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:09,080
be the Dj and do all that Shit.
Like,

748
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,710
like what hit his character was
really what the record was about.

749
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:15,530
And it was kind of like keeping
hope and in hanging, you know,

750
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:19,340
small communities and the
family and, and you know, the,

751
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:21,530
those kind of like friendships
and things like that,

752
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:25,430
that level is the only way that
people like unions, you know,

753
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:28,400
were started because it was like people
were like, I can't take this shit,

754
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:32,330
we can't take this shit anymore. And they
start like that connection, that level.

755
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:36,470
That's where you can grab the train and
you can end, you know when enough people,

756
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:38,360
it's like that occupy
thing. Man. When I was,

757
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,660
I was in New York living at the time when
the occupy Wall Street thing happened

758
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:45,950
and, and my daughter was going to
a school in the financial district.

759
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,780
So like when I drop her
off at school and I,

760
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,440
me and my buddy would walk over to the,

761
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,730
to the occupy Wall Street and just hang
out in the middle of the whole thing,

762
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:55,370
you know? And it got a bad rap and
it had all these different things,

763
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:59,600
but those motherfuckers were standing up
to the man and the man was like fucking

764
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:03,800
shooting the beanbags, Adam and shit.
And do you know it was really crazy.

765
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:07,520
Like there they had books and the cops
were burning the books and shit. It was,

766
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,370
it was like some scene.

767
00:44:08,371 --> 00:44:11,540
I like Nazi Germany when we walked
out of there is pouring rain.

768
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,810
There are people in the trees
like every 10 or 20 minutes,

769
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:18,050
like a whole bunch of cops with
those fucking guard things.

770
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:21,740
Would run through the fucking place and
knock some guy over a shields. Yeah,

771
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:26,480
the big sheet. Yeah, like the riot shit.
Like they're cops weren't right, but uh,

772
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,900
uh,
greatest scene.

773
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,010
I think someone filmed it
and I was there for it.

774
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,980
I've sitting in the middle of that thing,
that encampment,

775
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,320
the occupy Wall Street thing with my
friend Lincoln and we'd turn around,

776
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:44,330
man in this fucking cop comes running
with that fucking shield and just slips

777
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,880
because it's raining and he
just eat shit falls down man.

778
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:51,090
And it's like three or four
of these fucking hippies
are like, hey, you okay man.

779
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:54,120
You know, even though the rest of them
were like, fuck you pig, you know,

780
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,460
it was pretty funny,
man.

781
00:44:56,461 --> 00:45:01,080
This motherfucker just ate shit running
into that thing and everybody is just

782
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:03,930
laughing about it. All
that occupies stuff. To me,

783
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:07,020
it signals that this possibility,

784
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:09,520
like it wasn't entirely successful,

785
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,750
sort of awaken people to the
idea of protesting. You know,

786
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,170
that you could protest in a mass scale
to get a lot of attention and that people

787
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,950
are willing to get involved because
a lot of people did get involved.

788
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,920
But what it also said to me is
if things got real squirrely,

789
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:27,110
like remember when we almost invaded
Syria? Yeah. You know, and then the,

790
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,100
the response was so strong against it
that you don't hear a peep about invading

791
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:35,730
Syria. I mean, when Obama came on
television and gave that speech,

792
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:39,870
it was almost like invading Syria is
inevitable. And everybody was like,

793
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:44,250
fuck you man, fuck you.
And then it stopped.

794
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:46,020
There was silence in the news.

795
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:50,520
Like you literally don't hear a peep
out of the government talking about the

796
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:54,030
inevitable invasion of Syria. It just
doesn't exist anymore because the writer,

797
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,270
black [inaudible] or his wife or something
on television, hunger every, he's like,

798
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,350
Ooh, look over here.
This things happening.

799
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,580
And on the right and the
left were against it.

800
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,710
And if they had gone forward,

801
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,890
I think that an action like that,

802
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:12,570
and I think they're calculated in that
response that like when you have a

803
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,930
million people, like, like a Sha
saying, there was a one of those,

804
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,100
one of the dictators, I forget which
one it was, it was ousted. He just,

805
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,880
I forget which one it was,
was it a long time ago?

806
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:28,881
But it was because he had said that if
there was more than three people that

807
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:33,060
were, uh, together that were
protesting together as a group,

808
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:36,240
they would be shot on sight.
I forget which dictator it was.

809
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,430
And within two days,

810
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,150
3 million people were in front of
his castle calling for his head.

811
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,100
And it was like,
Oh shit.

812
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,820
Like when you have a million people in
the streets that are calling for your

813
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:51,990
head, the fucking, the Gig is
up. And the, the real, the,

814
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,420
the numbers when you deal with the,

815
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:59,100
the president and the secret service,
and then the government and the military,

816
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,420
the actual numbers of those people that
you would need to protect against a mob

817
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,930
of 5 million Americans
that have had enough.

818
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,200
And then come with rifles and guns
and just storm the gates like everyone

819
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:16,650
worries I people say, well, what do you
do? The fruit of the Second Amendment,

820
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:20,940
what do you need a gun for? What? Why
do you need a gun? You don't need a gun.

821
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,610
Like that was that was written
back when there was muskets.

822
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:28,200
Let me tell you something. If this shit
thing ever, if the shit hits the fan,

823
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,040
if the shit hits the fan like that,

824
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,840
and all of a sudden you've got three or
4 million people that are showing up on

825
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:39,841
the White House lawn and then they start
storming in mass and they literally

826
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,810
call for the president's head and
rip him apart on national television.

827
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,960
That's not outside the
realm of possibility.

828
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,420
Given a few terrible decisions,

829
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:53,710
a natural disaster or a nuclear
bomb goes off somewhere in Chicago,

830
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,890
the fucking shit hits the fan.
And then next thing you know,

831
00:47:56,891 --> 00:48:00,460
there's a million people with
guns. We'll buy as Jesus, you know,

832
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,430
anything can happen.
Any literally anything.

833
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:05,560
And that's what I got out
of occupy Wall Street.

834
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,310
I got out of like this
is this kind of descent.

835
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,920
It's manifesting itself in this form
right now where there's a bunch of people

836
00:48:13,921 --> 00:48:18,070
with fucking drum circles and they're
saying enough is enough. And that was,

837
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:20,950
it was too hippy. It wasn't that.
It was the one issue was it was too.

838
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,460
It was too too like Koombaya.
Yeah, it was. I mean they,

839
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:27,910
even though it got rowdy there at the end,
it's like it wasn't enough.

840
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:28,923
You know what I mean?

841
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,850
That's what happens when when liberals
go like go protest and, and then there's,

842
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:36,700
when the right wing is protest, they have
a whole different ritual. But it's like,

843
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,910
I feel like when you look at all of that,
like you said,

844
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,040
it's the power of it man. I mean the
Edward Snowden Shit, we get into that,

845
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:48,280
you know, you could get into the
power of like how that's changed.

846
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,710
Remember that everyone
was like, Ooh, the cloud,

847
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,170
the cloud is so fucking cool
that's going to do everything.

848
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:55,270
And then Snowden comes out
and they're like, shit,

849
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:56,980
we don't want our shit on
the cloud. Like, I mean,

850
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,880
they start changing like rebranding
the concept of the word of the cloud.

851
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,580
You know, like you go to Europe and it's
still the cloud, the cloud, the cloud.

852
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:05,920
But here I think everyone
started getting a little like,

853
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,200
well it doesn't matter if it's the cloud
because they're going right in your God

854
00:49:09,201 --> 00:49:12,820
damn. And they know they're going into
your hard drive put. They're their,

855
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:16,120
they're hacking your hard drive and they
are going right in there pulling out

856
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:19,660
all your data, pulling all your credit
card information and putting out all your,

857
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:21,430
your contacts.
You know,

858
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:25,540
if you are a person that involved
in some controversial activity,

859
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,580
every one that you call everyone that
you talk to, they get monitored. Now,

860
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,751
like if you,

861
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:34,690
if you start talking crazy shit about
the government on this podcast and then

862
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:37,990
you make a phone call,
if the NSA decides to monitor you,

863
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,730
they're gonna Monitor your buddies.

864
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,150
They're going to monitor people
you fucking play pool with,

865
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:44,920
they're gonna monitor a
guy you go drinking with.

866
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,720
Like everybody gets monitored and you
all become suspects. You all got on?

867
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,990
I got started getting monitored
after I went on this show. Oh,

868
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,830
it be before you even decided to go on
the show, when I was tweeting about you,

869
00:49:55,831 --> 00:49:57,660
you probably started getting
monetarily immediate.

870
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,540
Probably already monitored before that.
Probably. Probably. I wouldn't doubt that.

871
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:05,590
It's ridiculous. I mean it's like, look,
we're not criminals. There's not no ones.

872
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,090
These aren't criminals.

873
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,300
The idea that you're monitoring 99% of
the country or whatever the fuck the

874
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:13,180
numbers are, what does everybody
at criminal and then they're,

875
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,300
they're monitoring each other
like the Senate. They fucking,

876
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:19,920
the NSA was spying on
the Goddamn Senate man.

877
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,920
Did you read the thing about the world
Warcraft with one of the documents?

878
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:28,820
You know that game, the, the world of
Warcraft? It's like a, it's like an online

879
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,300
role playing game with like
1 million millions of players
go on around the world.

880
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:33,703
And they had,

881
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,330
they had NSA agents in there because
they were saying that that terrorists

882
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,790
groups were,
we're meeting in those games.

883
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:43,370
They would go in the game and they'd
meet and they had to talk in there.

884
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,390
So they said that they had so many in
essay agents in world of Warcraft that

885
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:52,070
they had to assign other NSA agents to
watch those NSA just inside of world war.

886
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,310
I mean,
can't you see these mother fuckers

887
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:59,070
playing like he's like a level
50 wizard. He's like, yeah man,

888
00:50:59,071 --> 00:51:03,050
we're going to bust some fucking terrorist
today. Fuck yeah, and kill it. Drag it.

889
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:03,884
And you know,

890
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,340
while they're busting other people who
are pretending to be terrorists so that

891
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,650
you bust other terrorists. And I was like,
yes, that's awesome. What a great idea.

892
00:51:13,651 --> 00:51:18,000
I'm going to go and I'm going to go on
an online game and I wonder how many

893
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:22,050
times there have been undercover sting
operations where an undercover drug

894
00:51:22,051 --> 00:51:27,051
dealer was selling drugs to an undercover
DEA h and posing as a god by drugs to

895
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,690
movie. It's a movie should write that.
Totally just write it into a movie.

896
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:34,860
They want to kill each other and then
everyone tries to cover it up and it

897
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:39,090
becomes some crazy story. It's kind of,
it must have happened before. It has to.

898
00:51:39,091 --> 00:51:41,220
If it had happened like 21 jump street,

899
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:45,810
the end of the movie with the Cameo
with uh, what's his name? Johnny Depp.

900
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:50,090
Maybe she was, did you see the new 21
jump street? No. No. That's great. Is it,

901
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,440
does a great cameo of Johnny Depp though,
just blew that for you then?

902
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,130
Well, similar to that, spoiler
alert, I think I'll be okay.

903
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,030
The undercover guy blowing it for the
other undercover guy kind of thing.

904
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,790
It's just when these guys start
spying on each other, it's like,

905
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:09,090
this is the CIA think that the Senate
is a bunch of criminals is that's what's

906
00:52:09,091 --> 00:52:13,050
going on or do you just have carte blanche
to just spy on people? So you're like,

907
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:16,050
fuck it. Let's buy on these guys. Let's
buy and everybody, I don't trust him.

908
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:18,020
Fuck that guy. Let's spy on him. Let's,

909
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,880
let's find out where his dick
pictures are hiding in his hard drive.

910
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:24,320
They said they pass those around the
office about chips they did in these and

911
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:28,170
stuff. They did it also. They like spied
the people that were in the office.

912
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:33,060
I spied on ex girlfriends.
They look fine. Ex girlfriend.

913
00:52:33,061 --> 00:52:36,630
That's the smartest thing they probably
did. You know what I mean? Man,

914
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:39,930
you could really, I'm going,
you know what? After that girl,

915
00:52:39,931 --> 00:52:42,810
I'm going to join the NSA and I'm gonna
work my way all the way to the top just

916
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:44,820
so I can fuck her for
the rest of her life.

917
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,250
It's just when the CIA
spies on the Senate,

918
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,060
I really think that they should bring
everybody involved and lock them up.

919
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,770
Just like you guys.

920
00:52:55,890 --> 00:53:00,060
You not only did you violate everything
that you're supposed to be standing for,

921
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,640
you guys are supposed to
be looking out for us.

922
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,110
The way you're looking at is by spying
on the fucking Senate. Looking in. Yeah.

923
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,900
Do you think that the Senate is bad?
Do you think that they're involved in,

924
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,150
are they terrorists?
Are they the enemy?

925
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,710
Are they working for the fucking Russians?

926
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:18,120
Like what do you toe in the fuck
are you doing wasting money?

927
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,990
Like you should go to jail just for
wasting tax dollars just for fraud.

928
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,580
Pretending that you're
here resolving democracy

929
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,980
or that you're here
protecting and serving.

930
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,070
You should go to jail just for
misrepresenting what your job is.

931
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,870
Cause you guys are gotten to him.
Crux.

932
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,810
Yeah. I mean a bunch of them, you
know, and that's why I love like I,

933
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,600
I'm on the Edward Snowden team
because it's just like fuck yeah,

934
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,580
that's what we work.
That's the kind of Shit,

935
00:53:43,581 --> 00:53:46,430
you know that like movies were
made up like that we wanted,

936
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,770
we wanted to happen and we
want some guy to be like, Yo,

937
00:53:48,771 --> 00:53:51,460
you all are getting
fucked and I'm going to,

938
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,770
I'm willing to die over this shit
and tell you about it, you know?

939
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:58,950
Yeah. And before Obama was
in office, that whole hoping,

940
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:04,410
fucking hope and change his website was
all about protecting whistle blowers.

941
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:09,460
All that shit was removed once all this
stuff started going down with Edward

942
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,690
Snowden and with Julian Assan.

943
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:15,790
But before that he was all about
protecting whistleblowers who are exposing

944
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:20,020
illegal activity. Guess what?
That's exactly what Snowden did.

945
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:25,350
Everything he did is protecting people
who are being exposed to dangerous

946
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:30,680
elements of attic control government.
I mean that's,

947
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:32,010
that's really what's going
on. I didn't, I didn't

948
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:35,670
realize that was on the, the Obama pay.
I mean, I never went to the Obama page,

949
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,240
but at the same time, like I never,
I never knew that, that he said that.

950
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:43,770
What a crock of shit. Jesus Christ. I
mean they were like, we had to say, Hey,

951
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:46,440
snow didn't come back here where we
promise we're not going to kill you.

952
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,400
Like when we, when America
has to say that, you know
what I mean? It's like fuck,

953
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:53,520
we're fucked. It's like Howard Stern
says, man, you know, he's like,

954
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:55,570
we're like the last, you know, we,

955
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:59,070
we are like the like people to
say we shouldn't police the world,

956
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,820
but the reality is, is like 90% of the
world were like murdering their own.

957
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:06,000
People are like stoning women death.
Like there's all these other countries,

958
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:09,330
like there's not many countries that
that says, Hey, fucking stop. Right.

959
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,240
That is what we want from
America is what we hope for.

960
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,190
But when you look at it and you look at
the NSA shit and all that, it's like,

961
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,530
you know, it's, it's just hard to get
all hyped up and excited about it.

962
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,600
I mean our world changed so much. Man,
I was talking to, I was talking to for,

963
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:29,310
I'm 35 and it's talking to
a friend of mine about this,

964
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,590
about how are my generation.

965
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,960
It was like our world is so
fucked compared to everybody
else's because I mean

966
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:39,600
it's probably just getting worse
for the other kids. But you know,

967
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:42,320
we saw like when we were 14 Kurt Cobain,

968
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,600
I was 14 curriculum and blew his
brains out. So like by that time,

969
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:47,100
like you're just kind of,
I was just kind of,

970
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:50,010
everybody's kind of hopeful
and then when that happens,

971
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:52,800
that's the first time that's
ever happened. It was so dark.

972
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,730
It was so like there was
photographs floating around
in my high school of it and

973
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:59,400
shit. And I remember kind of
being like, man, this is dark,

974
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:00,930
but it kind of like threw me,

975
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:05,010
I was really into nine inch nails and
Manson and shit like that and like threw

976
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:08,850
me into that world even more. And you
know, I, everybody loved the dark,

977
00:56:08,851 --> 00:56:12,660
love the dark and then fucking nine
11 happens when we were like 20,

978
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:17,370
21 and it's like, holy fuck, like
everything changed after that point.

979
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,970
Like everyone, everyone is a lot
darker. Everyone is like, realizes that.

980
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:26,530
Yeah. You know, that might
just, these massive assaults
can happen here. You know,

981
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:30,490
there was always kind of
like dreamy. It's, you know,

982
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:32,890
it's America thing.
It's like we always kind of,

983
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:36,580
even though there was a lot of corruption
with like, from Nixon to like the, the,

984
00:56:36,581 --> 00:56:40,990
you know, the Kennedy assassination and
shit, which was kind of the start of like,

985
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,830
like televise or, or public
or, uh, you know, uh,

986
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,600
broadcast in certain ways and newspapers
like death, mass death and weird,

987
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:51,850
crazy shit like that.
But you look at a,

988
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,570
there was always this kind of hopefulness
and I think like after nine 11 and

989
00:56:55,571 --> 00:56:57,620
after kind of everything that's gone,

990
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,900
like people are really like
disillusioned to it. You know, they,

991
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,230
we don't have that same,

992
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:05,700
that same kind of feeling that that was
going on in the eighties and nineties

993
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:09,700
you know what you're saying,
like the perception of what
America stands for. Yeah.

994
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,670
You used to be that. We wouldn't
know where else, you know,

995
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:15,700
everybody used to say it's the land of the
free. Like there's, they still, I mean,

996
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,220
you know, you still got to New
York and the cab driver guy who's,

997
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,970
who's by the way only driven for two
weeks because he got here two weeks ago.

998
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:26,320
Like he'll still tell you like, I'm God
damn so happy to be in America of course,

999
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:29,740
because you're in New York City and it's
beautiful and there is a beauty to that

1000
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:33,400
and, and what we offer the rest of the
world and people that are in these fucking

1001
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:35,920
terrible countries and they escape
and they come here and it's like that.

1002
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,820
That's great. But like in comparison
to the Congo were awesome. Yeah, yeah.

1003
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:43,850
Compares the Congo. We are awesome. But
at the same time we're also like, we've,

1004
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,060
we're like kids that,
you know,

1005
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,240
like I think the couple of
generations before as it was like,

1006
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:53,080
the parents stayed together and it
was like great. Like we're the kids.

1007
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:57,100
The mom shot the dad and got away
with it and we're like, all right.

1008
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:01,030
You know what I mean? Like, like
our, our, our vision of, of, uh,

1009
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:04,690
America is kind of like, yeah, we
really kind of hate our parents,

1010
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:07,800
but where I see what you're saying, you
know what I mean? Like, like I, yeah,

1011
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,580
that sounded weird when I said
it, but what I'm, what am,

1012
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,540
I know what you're saying though.

1013
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:15,310
Like I just feel like we kind of are
this weird w this world that we're in and

1014
00:58:15,311 --> 00:58:18,430
the three of us and everybody that we
know kind of now, it's like we have this,

1015
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,650
this kind of just disdain for things.

1016
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:23,620
Like you look at this fucking sandy hook
and all these terrible things that are

1017
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:24,640
happening and,

1018
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:28,450
and everyone wants to focus on the gun
rights thing when there's mental health

1019
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:30,730
issues that need to be dealt with.
There's all kinds of stuff,

1020
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,660
but there have been crazy people forever.
There have been murders forever.

1021
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,970
It's like, but changing the
system and trying to get ready,

1022
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:41,410
just everything just seems so
fucked. You know, you're like,

1023
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:44,020
you wake up and you just want to
watch cartoons. You don't want to be,

1024
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,290
definitely don't want to watch the
news and you definitely don't want like

1025
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:52,200
reasons why things are so fucked in in
as far as our perceptions is because

1026
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:55,860
we're getting more information about
the real dealings of our government now

1027
00:58:55,861 --> 00:58:59,640
than ever before because of guys like
joining a songs and because of guys like

1028
00:58:59,641 --> 00:59:03,060
Edward Snowden, one of the things that
people don't like about it is like, well,

1029
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:05,830
you know, they're exposing
American secrets. They're
putting Americans at risk.

1030
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:06,990
Well,

1031
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,830
maybe what Americans are doing is putting
Americans at risk because what they're

1032
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:14,940
doing is exposing truth,
exposing things that we don't like.

1033
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,590
I remember after September 11th,

1034
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:21,000
one of the things that I found like the
most shocking about it all was how many

1035
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:25,130
American flags were on people's cars.
Like I would drive to work.

1036
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,450
And that was crazy fucking madness, man.
Every car had an American flag on it.

1037
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:33,740
It was nuts. My friend Jay London, Jay
Lund had started selling American flags.

1038
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,600
Well, he was smart. He made a ton
because it was insane when that happened.

1039
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:40,390
You remember, he, it's like
exposing secrets, you know,

1040
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,220
Geraldo exposes secrets has put guys
in lives in danger, not Edward Snowden.

1041
00:59:44,221 --> 00:59:48,640
And that's like telling you yeah, but
the, the fucking, uh, the flags, man,

1042
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:52,110
that was insane. It was like this,
there was like a sense of, you know,

1043
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:55,960
but who knows if that was real, like the,
I mean, you know what I mean? It was real.

1044
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:59,710
People were buying the flags. That sense
of, of, of nationalism was real obviously,

1045
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:02,530
but at the same time,
like there was a side of it.

1046
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:05,720
It was just like there was marketing and
there was all these things and there,

1047
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:08,620
there was like the magic trick going
on in the right hand while there's shit

1048
01:00:08,621 --> 01:00:09,850
going over here on the left hand.

1049
01:00:09,851 --> 01:00:13,360
And then you have like the Fahrenheit
nine 11 movie and you're like, well,

1050
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:16,150
looking at that and everybody's
looking at in this loose change.

1051
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:18,970
And some people were saying it
wasn't a plane that hit the Pentagon.

1052
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:22,930
It was a missile and you got fucking
a, the wrestler. What's his name?

1053
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:25,000
It's got to tell you've been to her chair.
Uh,

1054
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,090
I feel like talking about they
got bombed paint, you know?

1055
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,640
Did you ever watch the nine 11
episode of that conspiracy theory?

1056
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,860
Here's the problem with
that conspiracy theory.

1057
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:34,570
I work with those very same people.

1058
01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:37,360
When I did the sci fi show Joe
Rogan questions, everything.

1059
01:00:37,361 --> 01:00:39,550
I loved that shit there.
That was a killer shoe.

1060
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,750
Thanks man. W W we still might
do it. We were still talking.

1061
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:46,020
I just don't want to do it the
way we did it because they,

1062
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,930
there's a lot of fuckery
involved in those shows.

1063
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:55,590
Turn the plane around, Alex Jones. Wants
to talk and it's like, wait a minute,

1064
01:00:55,591 --> 01:00:59,970
what? There's just, they
use those shows. They like,

1065
01:00:59,971 --> 01:01:04,971
they gravitate towards the
fantastic and avoid simplicity,

1066
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,620
employ and avoid, what would it be? Boring
TV, which is really the juice. Yeah.

1067
01:01:10,621 --> 01:01:15,090
I want to also avoid like other
possible scenarios that aren't as sexy.

1068
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:15,751
You know,

1069
01:01:15,751 --> 01:01:18,960
there's a lot of incompetence involved
in government and sometimes people,

1070
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:23,550
they misconstrue conspiracy,
they think of it's conspiracy.

1071
01:01:23,551 --> 01:01:27,660
It was really just a bunch of idiots that
did a shitty job of protecting people.

1072
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,120
And then you know,
the,

1073
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:34,121
the scramble afterwards and then people
that have capitalized on the scramble

1074
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,593
and made money.

1075
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:40,140
And then people look at the people
that capitalized on the event and say,

1076
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:43,480
oh well this is clear evidence that there
was a conspiracy and these people that

1077
01:01:43,481 --> 01:01:46,410
were the ones that profited off of it.
Maybe not.

1078
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,110
Maybe there was a fucking horrible event.

1079
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,530
And some people look at horrible events
as an opportunity to make money and they

1080
01:01:52,531 --> 01:01:54,930
did and they didn't have
anything to do with it happening.

1081
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,740
But they did have something to do
with profiting off of it. You know?

1082
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,540
So there's a lot of like,
and you,

1083
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:02,370
you people get involved in
these conspiracy discussions.

1084
01:02:02,371 --> 01:02:06,600
And unfortunately what happens is when
you start labeling a bunch of shit

1085
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:08,910
conspiracies that aren't
really conspiracies,

1086
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:14,300
you throw the whole thing into a tizzy
because now no one knows what the fuck to

1087
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:14,791
believe.

1088
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:18,450
And if I find out that you're wrong
about a bunch of ridiculous conspiracy

1089
01:02:18,451 --> 01:02:20,070
assumptions,
if you're wrong about

1090
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,400
those, what, what else? What
am I supposed to think about?

1091
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:26,340
All the other shit that you're
saying like I very right about that.

1092
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:31,320
And that's a real problem with conspiracy
theories is that the people who find

1093
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:33,030
them,
they're sexy to find.

1094
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,080
So people go looking for them and fucking
everything and they're not willing to

1095
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:40,980
abandon them once they have sort of
called them out once they've called that a

1096
01:02:40,981 --> 01:02:41,814
conspiracy theory,

1097
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:46,590
they stick with it and they ride that
fucker right into the rocks. You know?

1098
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:50,280
And a lot of these nine 11 guys are
like that and he's a is nine 11 guys.

1099
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,200
There's photos that people said,
look,

1100
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:56,730
it's clear that thermite it cut this
steel and the steel, that asshole,

1101
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:01,050
they cut that steel so they can move
it like this is all after the fucking

1102
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:05,100
buildings went down and you guys are
touting this as evidence that thermite was

1103
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:09,810
used. They cut the fucking girders so
that they can move that shit out of there.

1104
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:13,170
Well, you wanted to get rid of all
that waste and ship it over to China.

1105
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,990
What did you want him to do?
You want him to hang on to it?

1106
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:16,681
What do you want him to do?

1107
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:20,310
Put it in a pile so that you can go and
send your independent investigators that

1108
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:24,260
are going to go over and scan for
thermite. Yeah. Fuck man. See,

1109
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:25,480
I know you,

1110
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,500
you started talking about that in the
first thing to think about is the biggest

1111
01:03:28,501 --> 01:03:33,120
one is what happened was I bin Ladin
whole we dumped his body whenever that

1112
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:33,780
whole story.
Yeah.

1113
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,870
Everybody talks about that and it's
like people say he was not there.

1114
01:03:36,871 --> 01:03:39,720
That had nothing to do with.
There was never a situation there.

1115
01:03:39,721 --> 01:03:42,220
He was been dead for a long time.
A lot of people,

1116
01:03:42,221 --> 01:03:45,840
special ops people say that he's been
dead forever. Yeah. Yeah. Say that he,

1117
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:49,140
that he died ages ago and they just
did this to pull that dude out of the

1118
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:50,660
freezer and chucked them into the ocean.

1119
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:58,110
I don't know man. Who the fuck
knows? You're right though, man.

1120
01:03:58,111 --> 01:04:02,440
People were ride that shit down and
it's like you end up kind of like,

1121
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:06,850
he's more confusion. It is. It's like
white noise and static, you know,

1122
01:04:06,851 --> 01:04:11,640
around all the time. It's almost just
as bad as the is the is the media is,

1123
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:14,220
you know, while it, and it helps them,

1124
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,300
it helps anyone in government because
it also shows that anytime there's any

1125
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:21,090
sort of a cataclysmic disaster,
anytime there's any sort of an event,

1126
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:26,091
like a nine 11 there's so much scrambling
and there's so much chaos afterwards

1127
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:30,070
that it's impossible to get a clear
story on what exactly happened. Yeah.

1128
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,320
They love that. Yeah.
Especially if, you know,

1129
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,590
it's like when they're
involved in something.

1130
01:04:34,591 --> 01:04:37,710
That's why Edward Snowden and people
like that really terrifying because they

1131
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:41,730
tried to, you know, they planted fakes
node in stories that were like, there was,

1132
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,710
there was a Ufo one that they were trying
to plant them so he would look like a

1133
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:48,910
Kook and they weren't real real like it.

1134
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:50,550
It'd be like an article and then you know,

1135
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:54,290
some European magazine saying that
it's noted papers say that the,

1136
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:57,630
the government knew about Ufos and he's
had them for a long time and all this,

1137
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,920
those are a perfect one. Right? She
wanted to learn to cook. Perfect one man.

1138
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:05,340
I mean, I've never you, it's like I'm
obsessed with all this shit. You know,

1139
01:05:05,341 --> 01:05:08,400
I'm obsessed with all of it. But the
reality is is like I've never seen,

1140
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,480
I would love to see a ghost.
Babies never fucking seen a fucking ghost.

1141
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:15,330
I've never seen a fucking alien. I've
never seen any of it. I've tried.

1142
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:19,390
I've slept in haunted houses. I met
people that have, I've seen goat.

1143
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,360
Like anytime somebody tells
me ghost story, the first
thing I think it was like,

1144
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:24,610
you're fucking crazy. Like,
that's the first thing I think,

1145
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:25,720
because I've never seen one.

1146
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,830
Have you ever had an experience
with it goes or anything? No.

1147
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,290
I've gone to the comedy store really
late at night at the comedy store.

1148
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,970
Y'all heard about all that? I've heard
about all this shit about the murder,

1149
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,310
the killing room they had
up there or whatever. Well,

1150
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:41,170
the comedy store used to be Ciro's
nightclub and it was owned by Bugsy Siegel

1151
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:46,000
and many people were murdered there
and Ciro's nightclub, you know,

1152
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:50,620
this was back in the 1930s, I guess
in the 1940s, like whenever it was,

1153
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,690
there were the early 20th century and
that was a place where it Dean Martin and

1154
01:05:55,691 --> 01:05:57,220
Jerry Lewis would perform.

1155
01:05:57,221 --> 01:06:01,300
And the comedy store's
original form was like,

1156
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,590
essentially a mob club.

1157
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,340
It was a mob run nightclub and a
lot of people were killed there.

1158
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,730
There was a tunnel from the back
of the comedy store, main room,

1159
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:13,330
the green room in the main room where
you would go and take this tunnel up and

1160
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:17,650
do a house that was up in the hills like
they had it during the, uh, illegal, uh,

1161
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,900
bootlegging error. Wow. Yeah.

1162
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:23,680
There was a lot of wacky
shit that happened in that
place. And because of that,

1163
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:27,310
I've heard too many stories about a
person that sits in the audience or

1164
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:31,210
something. There's some lady that,
yeah, I've heard mostly bullshit.

1165
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,040
Mostly bullshit. I was there, I performed
at the comedy store for 13 years.

1166
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:40,300
Wow. And, uh, I never saw
shit. Yeah. I looked around.

1167
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,900
I went there late at night.
I would,

1168
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,220
I would sit in the main room when the
lights were out and everyone was gone and

1169
01:06:45,221 --> 01:06:50,140
just wait for shit to happen. Wow. Yeah.
Nothing happened it. See, that's what,

1170
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:53,560
that doesn't mean that
something couldn't be there.

1171
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:56,650
I just want to see some
fucking day, man. I mean,

1172
01:06:56,651 --> 01:07:00,250
these people like these fucking books
and he'd go on these talk shows and say

1173
01:07:00,251 --> 01:07:03,610
this shit. I'm like, I don't believe
a fucking word you're saying.

1174
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:07,420
I just can't believe it because I
can't, I've never seen it, man. I mean,

1175
01:07:07,421 --> 01:07:10,540
but imagine if you did
and what you saw was, uh,

1176
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:15,480
a brief but unique moment and in
that brief unique moment you saw.

1177
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:21,200
Yeah. And then it's gone and you're like,
what the fuck? But you saw it. Yeah.

1178
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,620
There's no way to measure it.
There's no way to become a cook,

1179
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:28,180
I guess you may be right. Talk shows and
be like, and then his face was, I mean,

1180
01:07:28,181 --> 01:07:29,340
I don't know man.
It's,

1181
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:32,890
I haven't completely ruled it out
because somebody brought out ghosts.

1182
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:35,740
I just want to see some proof. I
just want to see something. I mean,

1183
01:07:35,741 --> 01:07:36,850
it just seems so nuts.

1184
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:39,880
Like I got abducted by aliens and
my ass got probed and all this shit.

1185
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:41,290
Like I see these people and you're like,

1186
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:44,680
these poor people are so lonely
and they got nothing going on.

1187
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,980
And they either dream this shit up or
they're taken ambien walking around in

1188
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:51,850
their front yard, asleep, you know,
have this thing or whatever it is. Like,

1189
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,240
I just don't know.
It's like I want to man,

1190
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:57,640
me and my dad went to cause the
fire in the sky when I was a kid.

1191
01:07:57,641 --> 01:08:00,720
When that movie came out, you know, it
was just touching into mainstream all,

1192
01:08:00,721 --> 01:08:03,070
it's like alien abduction Shit,
you know?

1193
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:05,680
And I used to watch x
files every fucking week.

1194
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:09,080
I think that Travis Walton guys been
kind of called out as being a bullshit.

1195
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,660
Right. It turned out, it turned out to,

1196
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,880
there was some kind of thing
where there was fraud to it.

1197
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:16,070
It's like it always is going to,
it's like that. Have you seen

1198
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,780
that movie? It was so well done.
The well I mean the movies. Okay,

1199
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:24,890
but the fourth close,
the fourth kind. Oh yeah,

1200
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:27,710
no I didn't you see it cause it was like,

1201
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:30,590
yeah cause they had like this lady who's
supposed to be the real lady and they

1202
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:35,360
have her interviews with Mila Jovovich
and the scenes, but it was all fake.

1203
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,490
Like they set up this whole
thing. I mean, you know Blair,

1204
01:08:37,491 --> 01:08:41,810
which was the first to do this kind
of shit, but eventually like it's all,

1205
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,850
it's all coming down is fake.
I would think,

1206
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,980
well that's just entertainment,
you know? I mean it's,

1207
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,790
the real problem is
when you deal with the,

1208
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:52,710
the people that are involved in
the quote unquote Ufo community.

1209
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:56,010
Like I've interviewed a ton of those
for that television show and I sat down,

1210
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:59,280
we had the show.
Each episode was only an hour long,

1211
01:08:59,281 --> 01:09:04,281
but in that hour long episode
I had several hour plus
long conversations with a

1212
01:09:04,351 --> 01:09:06,510
lot of different people that
were involved in these things.

1213
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:11,220
And one thing that you get out of them
is that these mother fuckers only have

1214
01:09:11,221 --> 01:09:14,760
one option. That option in
their head is at you for real,

1215
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,920
even if they haven't seen shit themselves.

1216
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:21,260
And what they're not taking into account
is how many people are liars. How many,

1217
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:23,670
like I've told this story before,

1218
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:26,730
I was in the woods once
and I thought I saw a wolf.

1219
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:30,480
I thought it was a wolf for
about four seconds at the most.

1220
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:33,880
It was a squirrel saw a
squirrel. I was like, I said,

1221
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:38,610
Wolf Squirrel. What the fuck is wrong
with me? Like it was literally like that.

1222
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:42,660
Like I thought it was a wolf.
It was a squirrel and it was the woods.

1223
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:47,660
And I'm saying, and I'm also, I'm con,
I constantly check myself. I, I'm,

1224
01:09:47,661 --> 01:09:51,090
I'm a very objective like that what,
but most like what are you doing dummy?

1225
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:53,340
I'm always like saying that
to myself to make sure that,

1226
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:56,280
but some people don't ever say,
what are you doing dummy?

1227
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,690
Say I know what I saw. They're not
the joke with no punchline thing.

1228
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:03,090
You know what I mean? It's like there's
no punch line to get you out of it.

1229
01:10:03,091 --> 01:10:04,620
So you're stuck in a joke forever.
It's like,

1230
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:09,210
I know exactly you're talking about like
the other day my wife came home and I

1231
01:10:09,211 --> 01:10:14,130
was drunk with a knife because
I, because I had um, I had this,

1232
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:18,750
our doorbell fell off right at our door
bells, like, like stuck to our front door.

1233
01:10:18,751 --> 01:10:22,380
It's not like wired in some kind of
little wireless thing and it said it had

1234
01:10:22,381 --> 01:10:22,921
fallen off.

1235
01:10:22,921 --> 01:10:27,921
So I put it inside the house and my wife
was gone and I was working and I was

1236
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:29,131
drunk.

1237
01:10:29,131 --> 01:10:32,400
I was just drinking and hanging out and
like playing a video game that me and my

1238
01:10:32,401 --> 01:10:35,640
buddies play and stuff and I had been
drinking and all of a sudden the doorbell

1239
01:10:35,641 --> 01:10:39,570
rings and I'm like doorbells inside,
you know,

1240
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:44,430
like I'm like Holy Shit and
I'll get a knife out. You know?

1241
01:10:44,431 --> 01:10:47,380
Cause it's like if someone's a bad
guy to get a ring the doorbell first,

1242
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,850
where they get you, oh yeah, I'm old.

1243
01:10:48,851 --> 01:10:50,640
But they're in the house
and ringing the doorbell,

1244
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:52,640
letting me know they're in the
house. You know what, I'm not a guy.

1245
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:53,730
I'm not like a scaredy cat.

1246
01:10:53,731 --> 01:10:57,030
Like I'm always the guy that
goes downstairs to check it out.

1247
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,630
I'm got no problem with that.
I got no problems walking down the stairs.

1248
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,180
There may be somebody down that you know,
but at this moment I was like,

1249
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,120
I'm alone and the doorbell's ringing on
the inside of the house and this fucking

1250
01:11:06,121 --> 01:11:08,610
sucks and I'm hammered. So I'm like
getting the knife out, you know? But,

1251
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:12,270
but like I, again, same kind of thing.
Like, I think I'll see something,

1252
01:11:12,271 --> 01:11:14,130
I think I'll hear and my mind goes

1253
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:17,310
to these places, but at the end of the
day, I know it's ridiculous, you know,

1254
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,290
and unless it's a home
invasion of tweakers.

1255
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:21,780
That's the only thing I'm worried about.
Tweaker home invasion,

1256
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:25,140
which was rampant here when I first
moved into town in the flatlands.

1257
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:30,090
But yeah tweaker home invasions are real.
It's tweets tweakers need money.

1258
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:30,970
Bad.
They,

1259
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,560
they come up with wacky plans and that's
the number one thing that happens to

1260
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:38,010
meth heads as they lose their ability
to make good decisions. Yeah. Yeah.

1261
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:40,020
Cause it's like after a couple
of days and shit, you know,

1262
01:11:40,021 --> 01:11:44,580
you're been for like nine days, get
more. Yeah. Well they also like,

1263
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:48,720
they don't see how, it's almost
like their judgment gets cut off.

1264
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,270
Like they can only see like
a couple steps forward.

1265
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:54,090
They can't see like the
whole future. So they, they,

1266
01:11:54,091 --> 01:11:56,970
they see a co I know what I'll do,
I'll just store all the math in my ass,

1267
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,770
you know,
and no one's going to check there.

1268
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,330
And then they get arrested and they're
pulling math out of the rest. What,

1269
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,920
what are you doing back there man?
I just find it like high as I find it.

1270
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:06,600
Do you know that people
store things in their ass?

1271
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,640
Guys have stored guns in their ass.

1272
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:12,810
So there's this one article in Gq about
this guy who was a lawyer and he was

1273
01:12:12,811 --> 01:12:17,430
representing um, meth heads and
somewhat thing was juke vanity fair.

1274
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:18,990
Gq One of those.
And uh,

1275
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,980
along the way start doing meth and
then he started selling meth. Wow.

1276
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:27,360
And then he kind of,
yeah, he had his basement,

1277
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:30,120
had like buckets of meth.

1278
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,860
Like he had like made it and like was
storing it in his basement, if you like.

1279
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:38,640
Are you out of your fucking mind? Yeah,
he was. Yeah. He was out of his mind.

1280
01:12:38,641 --> 01:12:43,190
That's insane. He was a
lawyer representing meth
heads who became Heisenberg,

1281
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:46,320
like full went full retard did that.

1282
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,970
So it's saying what a great story and
now I've got to find that article.

1283
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,980
Yeah. I wish that it was
many years ago. I wish.

1284
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:57,090
But I remember reading that one of the
experts that we're interviewing was

1285
01:12:57,091 --> 01:13:01,230
talking about you're a lack of ability
to make critical decisions and that it

1286
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:04,800
goes out the window. It's one of
the first symptoms of a Matthews.

1287
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:09,150
As people start doing like rational
people started doing really irrational

1288
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:13,140
things and don't seem to understand the
consequences of it. It's like they can't,

1289
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:18,300
there's just so they don't see, you
know, you see several steps ahead.

1290
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,090
Like you say like, well, you know, um,

1291
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:23,670
if I go outside and
light that car on fire,

1292
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:27,240
well if it explodes and then what are
the tree catches on fire and then the

1293
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:29,880
building catches on fire. Fuck
man, I could start a big fire.

1294
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,500
Meth heads don't think that.

1295
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,990
All they think is I'm going to
like that fucking car on fire.

1296
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,490
Nothing's gonna happen.
You know? That's, it's, so,

1297
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,440
I know I have known plenty of people
who have gone down that path and I mean,

1298
01:13:40,441 --> 01:13:44,610
I've tried this shit if you've tried math.
Yeah, because it like, it's just like,

1299
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,310
it's like really powerful coke. It's
like if you got like I've been, I had,

1300
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:52,520
there have been times in places where
someone is, is it had that shit like,

1301
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:54,990
I mean it's,
I'm not a big,

1302
01:13:54,991 --> 01:13:57,210
I'm not like fucking dude in
blow all day long or anything,

1303
01:13:57,211 --> 01:14:00,060
but there've been times I've done shows
and shit and there's me around and be

1304
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:02,590
like, hey man, you want a party? And
I'm like, yeah, fuck it man. Yeah,

1305
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:06,120
that's the guy you like think the guy's
going to chop up some glow or something.

1306
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:07,900
Right. And then it was, it'll be like a,

1307
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,160
it's meth but I mean it's
funny to call it because it's

1308
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,210
crank or speed.

1309
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:16,990
Like when I first moved
here I was partying a bunch
and there was this guy that

1310
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:21,370
had like this yellow dog speed. It
was like yellowish powder. It wasn't,

1311
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,430
and it's the same kind of effect.
Like it like one line of it,

1312
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,710
we'll keep you up for like 10 hours.

1313
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:31,390
Like with coke you want to do more
every hour or every 30 minutes.

1314
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:35,140
And with math, like you do a line and
you're like, Ooh, like for fucking,

1315
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,210
you can stay on for like 10
hours, you know, if you want to.

1316
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:39,880
And then those guys like that's why Matt,

1317
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:43,300
like you don't need as much of it and
they'll just do some or they'll smoke it

1318
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:47,560
and do that. And you know, it's like,
that's what it is. It's like really,

1319
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:48,790
really powerful coke.

1320
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:52,090
So like I can't stay up all night and
coke and I have stayed up all night one

1321
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:52,780
time on math.

1322
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,650
Just one line of it of just being up
and you just like play the guitar and

1323
01:14:56,651 --> 01:15:00,880
you're like seeing and you're just so
into singing, you know. But like in the,

1324
01:15:00,881 --> 01:15:04,600
in the southeast where we play a lot,
it's, it's so big down there. I mean,

1325
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:05,411
I mean every,

1326
01:15:05,411 --> 01:15:09,170
like my buddies that live in Kentucky
and stuff like it's everywhere and that

1327
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:12,370
their buddies, I'll do it and they'll,
you know, fall, they'll do it.

1328
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:15,310
Sometimes they'll do it occasionally and
then one of the guys will start doing

1329
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:17,560
it too much and he'll fucking like,
you know,

1330
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:21,280
there's tons of sad stories guys with
kids and shit that are just doing it and

1331
01:15:21,281 --> 01:15:24,100
staying over eight and nine days and the
kids have no idea and they're fucking

1332
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:28,630
just wired and get, you know, so
I mean it's, it's just insane.

1333
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:32,440
It's not, it's, it, it burns like
a motherfucker too. When you do it,

1334
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,590
like when you take,
when you do it,

1335
01:15:33,591 --> 01:15:36,940
if you do a why I did it like
burns your nose like insane.

1336
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,780
Like burns the inside of your nose.
Yeah. I mean, but it's kind of awesome.

1337
01:15:40,781 --> 01:15:43,750
The burn, the burn is kind
of the addictive thing
cause it's like, it's like,

1338
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:49,480
then you're like eating Jalapenos.
Yeah. It's like snorting Jalapenos.

1339
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,800
So how many times he'd done meth?
Ah,

1340
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,540
probably going to sound like a
lot. Five. Five, Eh, don't worry.

1341
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,520
The worry that people have is that you
do it once and then you're gone. No,

1342
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:05,080
it's not like heroin in that way.
I've never done heroin, but it's,

1343
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:07,600
but I know people have been on heroin.
I know it's like the,

1344
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:12,250
there's that immediate like euphoria
thing and, and with, with, with math,

1345
01:16:12,251 --> 01:16:16,570
the reason why it's so cheap, it's
so cheap. It's so much more potent.

1346
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:20,080
And I think that's why it's such a big,
and it's like, it's such a big deal,

1347
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,040
you know,
it's,

1348
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:25,840
it's easy to make with weird shit and
Draino and all this fucking shit in it.

1349
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,000
And then in Sudafed and all that,
you know,

1350
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:30,640
I mean they got to in the south where
they had to move sudafed behind the

1351
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:33,970
counter because people were
coming in and buy and like six,

1352
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:36,280
seven packs of sudafed.
If you buy it on here,

1353
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:39,200
you have to give you your drivers on
it. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's true.

1354
01:16:39,201 --> 01:16:41,950
We did in the south where they were
like real fast. But I mean, you know,

1355
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:44,920
I mean I probably, there's
probably been times, I mean,

1356
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:46,780
there's probably been times
I've may have done it,

1357
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:49,590
like where I thought I was doing something
else and then I'm like, oh, that's,

1358
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:53,710
that's definitely, that's definitely
crank. You know what I mean?

1359
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,500
But it's like my brothers
and sisters and cousins,

1360
01:16:56,501 --> 01:16:59,440
I mean they probably hate me for saying
this, but I mean where they come from,

1361
01:16:59,441 --> 01:17:03,190
that's common. It's common that
people have done crank or, or do it.

1362
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,690
I mean it's not, it's not like weird and
it's, it's definitely not addictive. Like,

1363
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:09,531
I mean,

1364
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:12,350
if you're the type person who's never
done cocaine and you do cocaine and all of

1365
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:15,530
a sudden you're like, fuck, I gotta do
more cocaine all the fucking time. Like I,

1366
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:19,190
I know certain people that are into coke
like that, but I could never do that.

1367
01:17:19,191 --> 01:17:23,330
Like if I do have done coke, I can't do
it for another couple of days. I'm not,

1368
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,350
I'm not the guy who stays up all night
and does the whole bag and does, I'll,

1369
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:28,520
I'll do like, you know,
bump or something like that.

1370
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:31,370
But it's been a long time since
I've done it. But if I did do it,

1371
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,130
I would just do small amounts
of it, you know, here or there.

1372
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,340
But there are people that if you have
that personality where you're going to be

1373
01:17:37,341 --> 01:17:38,540
the guy who does,

1374
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:41,210
he locks himself in a hotel room
for three days and it does blow.

1375
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:44,660
It doesn't show up for your job and all
that shit because just because you got a

1376
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:46,880
bag of blow at, uh, at a party, you know,

1377
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,100
then you're going to have
a problem with crank.

1378
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:53,200
But I think it's the same kind of thing
though. It's just hardcore mandate.

1379
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:57,890
It's not my style. Like some
certain people prefer crank to coke,

1380
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,930
then I would like,
or you know,

1381
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:03,350
some people were for Adderall and do
all that and it's like kind of like,

1382
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,680
I mean none of it excites me that much,
but I would definitely,

1383
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:11,090
anything that lasts a really long time
I can't do, I've got kids and shit.

1384
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,370
You know what I mean? Like
if I'm in a party, I'm like,

1385
01:18:13,371 --> 01:18:17,000
weed is like right down my
alley. That's, I love weed.

1386
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:18,710
I can fucking do it in the studio.

1387
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:23,180
I do it at night after kids are asleep
to go to bed like it. It's kind of you.

1388
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,310
It's never going to fuck you up so much.

1389
01:18:25,311 --> 01:18:28,550
You can't snap out of it and fucking
make a good decision at times.

1390
01:18:28,551 --> 01:18:31,400
You know you can like, man, I shouldn't
have fucking ate that old pizza,

1391
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,760
but you know that it's not like,
you know,

1392
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:38,630
I went and robbed my mom's house and I
woke up two days later in a ditch and I'm

1393
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:42,740
like, fuck, probably shouldn't done that
crank. Yeah, it's still speedy ones.

1394
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:46,970
They accelerate you and they, they cut
out a lot of decision making process.

1395
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,760
They definitely do. They
definitely, I mean it just in an,

1396
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:53,180
there's no two ways about it.
After you've been up an entire day,

1397
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:57,130
you just start fucking,
I mean you start seeing stuff like I,

1398
01:18:57,131 --> 01:18:59,690
I've done that it without drugs.
You know what I mean?

1399
01:18:59,691 --> 01:19:03,950
I've stayed up days and you just start
getting delirious in like when you're

1400
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:07,560
using something that's fueling your
heart rate and keeping you there,

1401
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:11,750
your brain is still acting as if you are
not on the drugs and you've been up for

1402
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:15,350
five days and you're seeing she had,
but yet you're just wired from that shit.

1403
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:18,290
That's what they do. The home
invasion thing, like there was a, um,

1404
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:21,510
I used to live on a, what I've
lived all of this town, but uh,

1405
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,970
Santa Monica and gardener, there's
a astro burger right there. Yeah.

1406
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,790
I lived right there behind the fat burger
and there was a house there that were

1407
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:29,481
notoriously,

1408
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:33,530
had been like tweakers like kick the door
down and came in and were just fucking

1409
01:19:33,531 --> 01:19:36,460
like tied the whole family
up and Shit and money.

1410
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:40,230
Cause that's all they want is they want
money to buy more crank, essentially the,

1411
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:41,841
the,
the deal.

1412
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:44,870
But they ended up fucking killing people
and all kinds of shit over, you know?

1413
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,200
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know the
thing, we're going to get caught.

1414
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:51,170
Kelly's people will fuck it. We'll never
get caught that way. Yeah. You know,

1415
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:54,860
they're not seeing a bunch of
steps ahead. Yeah. For sure.

1416
01:19:54,861 --> 01:19:56,390
People are terrified of crank their,

1417
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,480
they're terrified of math are terrified
of anything that makes people maniacs.

1418
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:02,780
You know, that's the big fear.
Yeah. Over the bath salts craze.

1419
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:06,050
Then guy who like chewed the dude's face
off and it turns out he wasn't on bath

1420
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,160
salts like well he was,
here's the thing,

1421
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,100
they they say, oh we, all they
found in his system was marijuana.

1422
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,130
The real problem is they don't
have tasks for bath bath salts,

1423
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:17,070
so when they say huge issue in Kentucky,

1424
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:21,030
my friend because he crank is now getting
to where it's like too expensive and

1425
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:23,920
the coal miners, the coal mine, the,

1426
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:27,150
you know the tests for amphetamines show
up in their systems to the coal miners

1427
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:28,560
one and that.
That's why they,

1428
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,180
that that bath salts things started
because the, from what I heard,

1429
01:20:33,181 --> 01:20:36,840
one of one of the regions I guess was
that the coal miners are doing that and it

1430
01:20:36,841 --> 01:20:38,310
wouldn't show up on the test.
They'd go,

1431
01:20:38,311 --> 01:20:42,510
they'd fucking smoke or snort a bunch
of that shit and go down in the fucking

1432
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:46,380
coal mines and fucking work for like
three days straight. It makes sense there.

1433
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:50,160
They don't. What they do
apparently was they take a drug,

1434
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:52,110
whether it's math or
something along those lines,

1435
01:20:52,111 --> 01:20:55,980
and then they alter it slightly so
that it doesn't show up in a task.

1436
01:20:55,980 --> 01:21:00,630
But it still has some pretty significant
response. Yeah. And the human body.

1437
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,110
And then they sell it as not for
human consumption. Bath salts.

1438
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,130
Like I didn't understand it.

1439
01:21:05,131 --> 01:21:08,730
I thought it was just like people have
figured out that bath salts make you high

1440
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:10,140
when you, you do, I'm like,

1441
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,200
there's something weird about the vast
salts you snoring, but no, they just,

1442
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,890
they're selling them as bad, bad faults
because that's the way he could sell it.

1443
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,430
Yeah. There's fake pot too that they
sell. It's like something like that.

1444
01:21:20,431 --> 01:21:23,520
And I tried to back on that one time
and it was terrible. It was like,

1445
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:25,700
just give me a headache
instantly. You know, you're,

1446
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:30,120
you could've smoked a cookie and
probably done less damage. You know,

1447
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,000
I have to say like I'm,
I'm a foodie too and all this and I just,

1448
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:34,560
while we're on this,
I don't know when I punched in my head,

1449
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:38,370
but there was a tweet you sent out that
I saved the photograph and I look at it

1450
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:42,570
is that when you had like seven eggs and
it was like clearly a little butter in

1451
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:44,460
the, in the pantry. And I
cook too. And I was like,

1452
01:21:44,461 --> 01:21:46,500
I was looking at this fucking
thing and I was like, God,

1453
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:48,390
I could eat that all day and all night.

1454
01:21:48,391 --> 01:21:50,700
But the fact that you had that photograph,
the seven eggs,

1455
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:55,210
I have it in my phone right now.
I have 24 chickens. Really? Yeah.

1456
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:59,270
So those are all fresh eggs from my yard.
Yeah.

1457
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:02,610
It's so great when you can get out and
jump into that. No, no, no worries man.

1458
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,860
And it was like the eggs
are, you know, I'm getting,

1459
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:08,070
I'm like the day they come out,
come out of the chicken boom,

1460
01:22:08,071 --> 01:22:12,510
I'm frying them and it's a dark,
like an orange yolk. So dear.

1461
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:15,090
Like if I go to a restaurant, a
diner in our order, some eggs,

1462
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:18,270
and you look at the Yolk, you're like,
what did you guys feed your chickens?

1463
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,960
Like paper?
Nothing that there's nothing in this yoke.

1464
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:26,820
I think I have the fucking
photographs. I did. I did.

1465
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:28,800
I know I saved it.
It's in here so,

1466
01:22:28,801 --> 01:22:31,950
well I've been eating
nothing but farm fresh eggs.

1467
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,860
Like we're for the past year.

1468
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:39,450
My goal is by the end of this year,
to have all the meat in my house.

1469
01:22:39,451 --> 01:22:44,090
Be Wild game that I've killed our eggs.
Be the Chicco hunting La.

1470
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:48,840
Yeah. It's funny. I've never been hunting.
Really? Yeah. I'm a computer nerd.

1471
01:22:48,841 --> 01:22:53,550
Like was as a kid. Like my
dad. We went, we went out
shooting. One time I did quail.

1472
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:57,030
I did quail hunting with my buddy
when I was a kid. I mean, you know,

1473
01:22:57,031 --> 01:23:00,420
if they go out in the field
and everybody's shooting
at the fucking birds and

1474
01:23:00,421 --> 01:23:04,710
shit, but I never, I've never
even been hunting. I mean,
I've just never been my, my,

1475
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:06,190
it's never been my thing.
Like I like

1476
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,240
guns. I've, I've, I've gone shooting guns
and things like that but, but I've never,

1477
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:14,270
I've just never really
done it. I mean I, I,

1478
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,390
I can tell you like I can,
there are people around and be like,

1479
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:20,320
I can never fucking blow his brains
out or whatever. But I mean I,

1480
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:24,470
I would go with you. I would
definitely go. I'm not like,
I'm not opposed to going.

1481
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:26,800
So you wouldn't go,
but you wouldn't pull the trigger.

1482
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:30,730
I don't know if I would pull the trigger.
I never killed an animal with a gun.

1483
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:35,050
Have you ever had venison? Oh, I love it.
I love it only comes from killing deer.

1484
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:37,960
You got to kill. No, I know, I know that.
I'm just saying, you know what I mean?

1485
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:40,110
But there are certain people
that are like, I like,

1486
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,490
and I mean my wife would never kill it.
You never know.

1487
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:45,490
Go hunting or like I that I have lots
of friends. I'd probably be like,

1488
01:23:45,491 --> 01:23:48,580
I don't know if I could do it, I would
go, got no problem with it. I've, I've,

1489
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:51,070
I think that there's so many good
things that come from haunting,

1490
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:52,540
like whether it be,

1491
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:55,810
and I love that when people say that
they hunt their own their own meat and,

1492
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,650
and eat it and all that. I'm just
saying I've never done, I mean people,

1493
01:23:59,651 --> 01:24:01,750
people think that I'm
like a Harley riding.

1494
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,360
Like they think I'm tall first of all.
Then second of all,

1495
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:05,890
they think that I'm like into hunting and,

1496
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:08,710
and like all this redneck
shit and I've been like,

1497
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:12,220
I have a computer geek that
moved to La when I was 29 I said,

1498
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,960
well you sing country music.

1499
01:24:13,961 --> 01:24:17,230
Your Dad is one of the great
country icons of all time. I know,

1500
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:19,870
but he didn't really hunt or do anything
like that either. He was that he had,

1501
01:24:19,871 --> 01:24:24,310
he had a gun collection of like civil war
era guns and stuff. And he's into, into,

1502
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:27,980
into that kind of stuff, very into history
and stuff, which I was real good. He,

1503
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,680
you know, in his own way,
he was kind of Nerdy,

1504
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:33,070
forgot from being from Texas
and being who he was, you know?

1505
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,250
But he was just kind of in into
history and things like that.

1506
01:24:36,251 --> 01:24:40,840
But we went hunting with Hank jr one
time and neither one of us hit nothing.

1507
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,850
Like we would go fishing
every once in a while. Uh,

1508
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:46,060
Toni Jo White was a great artist
who used to take us fishing.

1509
01:24:46,061 --> 01:24:48,850
My Dad had said he had a curse,
like you can never catch anything.

1510
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:52,690
And I went fishing the Johnny Cash one
time too. Wow. Was just kind funny.

1511
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:56,890
But as a kid and we went fishing
with Johnny Cash. Holy Shit.

1512
01:24:56,891 --> 01:25:00,700
Johnny had like a bunch of fish that he'd
already caught and he had them rigged

1513
01:25:00,701 --> 01:25:01,680
somewhere that,
so they,

1514
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:03,790
so he was gonna try and make
it where my dad would actually,

1515
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:07,670
does he think he caught something?
Cause he couldn't ever go like we were,

1516
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:11,320
we were rural out, outdoorsy
people. Let's just hit that way.

1517
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:14,170
Like I watch way more
horror movies with my dad.

1518
01:25:14,171 --> 01:25:16,230
Like he's to wake me up in the
middle of the night. It's eight.

1519
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:19,510
There's a scary movie on TV and I go
downstairs. I was like six or seven.

1520
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:23,510
I got onto it and proceed to like it
petrified by some horrible movie that

1521
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:26,170
actually six year old
shouldn't lodge malaria.

1522
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:30,280
So I was kind of more our activity,
listened to music and watch movies.

1523
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:31,360
It's funny isn't it,

1524
01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:35,980
that country music is inexorably connected
to like hunting and fishing? Yeah,

1525
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:38,990
well I mean naturally I guess
you know, because the, the,

1526
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:42,730
the era and the like, you know,
if you go back a little bit,

1527
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:46,330
I mean not very far from
my dad's generation, me and
him growing up and all the,

1528
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,440
all of the grand old Opry and all that
hit, I mean all those guys were into that.

1529
01:25:50,441 --> 01:25:52,390
They all lived in the woods,
like the tea,

1530
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:55,520
the Nashville and less
time and say Nashville,

1531
01:25:55,521 --> 01:26:00,100
like even all of the southeast was far,
far more undeveloped.

1532
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:04,160
So like back then it was really
country folks and they were in like

1533
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,860
country music.

1534
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,490
They would roll their windows up when
they listen to it because it was frowned

1535
01:26:07,491 --> 01:26:09,500
upon. It was like a poor
people's music, you know?

1536
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:11,720
So a lot of the people
in the south and stuff,

1537
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,630
it's inevitably tied into that of course.
But I mean,

1538
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,390
you know it's funny because
now it's like someone,

1539
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:21,020
if they're critical of I like I don't
represent myself pretending to be like

1540
01:26:21,021 --> 01:26:21,771
anything.
I'm not,

1541
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:25,490
but if someone was ever critical of the
fact that I live in La and I'm not like

1542
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:27,410
a country boy and I play
like country style of music,

1543
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:31,970
it's like do you guys really think that?
You know Jason Aldeen and these fucking,

1544
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,250
these new country guys that are so big,

1545
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:38,510
like you really think those guys at daily
existence is like tailgate parties and

1546
01:26:38,511 --> 01:26:39,950
hunting and things like that.

1547
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:43,190
You guys are fucking retarded because
they're shopping for shoes on Melrose.

1548
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,660
Getting caught cheating
at the Cabo Cantina.

1549
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,220
I say shopping for shoes.

1550
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:57,110
Oh man, he's making it look
country man. These pre,

1551
01:26:57,470 --> 01:27:01,860
these genes are perfectly
pre, pre torn, right?

1552
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,900
Perfectly Praetorian is the worst.
God. It's so fucking stupid.

1553
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:09,520
There's nothing stupider than wearing
jeans that are already have holes in a

1554
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:12,570
builtin. It's so dumb. No,
of course it's so dumb,

1555
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:16,190
but it's something that everybody wants.
They want to like already be worn in,

1556
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:19,460
you know, they want to pretend
that you're like, this is,

1557
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:23,540
I'm at ease that they've,
they've been, you know,

1558
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:25,500
really really wearing it out for them.

1559
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:28,440
They don't even look
remotely like uniform.

1560
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:33,020
We worn like when people have those
genes that have holes in the knees,

1561
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:38,050
like it's obvious you didn't get those
holes working all the rest of the genes.

1562
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:39,790
Perfect.
You just got to snap.

1563
01:27:39,791 --> 01:27:44,060
And I'm like what a weird
thing to become a style. Yeah.

1564
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:48,840
Holes in your clothes is a style. Yeah,
I know. It's like seeing my jeans.

1565
01:27:48,841 --> 01:27:51,590
Like I don't, I'm the worst.
Like I don't wash my jeans.

1566
01:27:51,591 --> 01:27:52,790
Like I wear them for months

1567
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:58,400
and like they literally get holes warning
them like because of, because of that,

1568
01:27:58,401 --> 01:28:02,270
like I'll get them in the knees sometimes
I d I walk on the back of them so like

1569
01:28:02,271 --> 01:28:04,950
the backs of them are like ripped,
you know what I mean?

1570
01:28:04,951 --> 01:28:08,840
And so I eventually get holes in them
because they're just old and shitty.

1571
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:11,180
But it's so funny man.
It's like there's,

1572
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:14,150
but there's like all these weird
styles right now that are just like,

1573
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:18,530
what is happening? Like
those, um, affliction kind
of thing that was going on.

1574
01:28:18,531 --> 01:28:21,740
Like all those national guys were
wearing all the tribally looking shit,

1575
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:26,480
all the skulls and, yeah.
But not like cool looking
shirts, like your shirt, like,

1576
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:28,730
you know, that's a monkey either. Well,

1577
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:31,850
that's a chimp with a mushroom in his
mouth. That's my own one, actually.

1578
01:28:31,851 --> 01:28:34,520
This primate.com.
This is all,

1579
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:38,500
this shirt is based on Terence
Mckenna stoned ape theory. Ooh.

1580
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:43,220
That a lower hominids ate mushrooms and
then they have this ideal of a nuclear

1581
01:28:43,221 --> 01:28:48,110
power and spirituality. Yeah. That's
what the shirt represents. Interesting.

1582
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:52,550
Yeah. Kinda had this bizarre
a idea that's, it's an
interesting idea that his, uh,

1583
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,650
his brother actually, his brother
Dennis Mckenna was still alive.

1584
01:28:55,651 --> 01:28:59,570
It was a fascinating guy himself actually
substantiated with science in a way

1585
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,980
that's way better than I ever could.

1586
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,420
If you want to listen to the first podcast
that I did with Dennis Mckenna and,

1587
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:06,840
um,

1588
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:11,700
he explains the actual effect that
silicide been has on the mind and why it

1589
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:16,380
would, uh, why he would facilitate
the construction of language and that,

1590
01:29:16,381 --> 01:29:19,020
what would he would McKenna's theory was,

1591
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:24,050
was that what happened to lower
primates is that somewhere around,

1592
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:26,303
you know,

1593
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:31,330
a million plus whatever years ago
when over a period of 2 million years,

1594
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:35,670
the, uh, the size of the
human brain doubled and a,

1595
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:40,200
that's like a very substantial
event in biology and they,

1596
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:44,130
they really have no idea what caused
human beings to become so much more

1597
01:29:44,131 --> 01:29:45,630
intelligent than they were previous.

1598
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:51,060
And his theory is that this
is at the same time that the,

1599
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:51,923
um,

1600
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:56,730
these tropical rainforest receded into
grasslands climate change forced these

1601
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:00,060
tropical rain forest,
uh, to become grasslands.

1602
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:05,210
And these monkeys climb down off
trees and started experimenting with,

1603
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:07,740
uh, various food sources,
different things.

1604
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:11,880
And one thing that they do is they start
flipping over cow patties and they find

1605
01:30:11,881 --> 01:30:14,220
bugs and worms and shit
to eat underneath them.

1606
01:30:14,221 --> 01:30:17,400
But there was also things growing on
the cow patties and those things were

1607
01:30:17,401 --> 01:30:18,470
psilocybin mushrooms,

1608
01:30:18,471 --> 01:30:21,850
pals in the jungle though this is like
they've grassland robbed and they've got

1609
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,440
this, the seeded into grasslands over
the, the climate had changed. Right.

1610
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:30,560
And rain forests had become grasslands
fascinate and so these monkeys ate

1611
01:30:30,991 --> 01:30:34,740
mushrooms. Exactly. And
then got smarter. Yeah.

1612
01:30:34,741 --> 01:30:36,720
And there's a bunch of
different reasons why,

1613
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:40,660
besides the facilitation of
language, which is, uh, the,

1614
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:45,510
the very specific reaction to psilocybin
has on the human mind and why Dennis

1615
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:47,940
Mckenna described it very well.
I can't really repeat what he said.

1616
01:30:47,941 --> 01:30:50,130
I'm not smart enough.
I don't remember it either.

1617
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:54,560
But what Mckenna also
said was the silicide in,

1618
01:30:54,561 --> 01:30:59,550
in low doses increases visual
acuity. It's a, it sharpens edges.

1619
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:01,320
It makes you be able to see things better.

1620
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:05,310
It makes you hornier so it would make
you see better and make you horny or,

1621
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:06,900
so it would make you,
if you see better,

1622
01:31:06,901 --> 01:31:08,590
you'd probably be more
aware of things about you.

1623
01:31:08,591 --> 01:31:12,150
A better hunter if you're horny or
you'd fuck more. So the, the mush,

1624
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:17,180
the mushroom meaning monkeys would have
a biological advantage over the non

1625
01:31:17,551 --> 01:31:18,290
mushroom meeting.

1626
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:21,420
Montrez well you do know if a bunch of
monkeys are walking around and one of

1627
01:31:21,421 --> 01:31:25,170
them eats mushrooms and all the sudden
he's like no, there he'd be like, dude,

1628
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,610
you guys got to try this shit.

1629
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:30,930
It's like that at all the
things that make sense.

1630
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,400
As far as looking at the effect
of a substance, the, the,

1631
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,860
the effects of a
substance has on the body,

1632
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:42,660
what would cause massive consumption of
the substance over a long period of time,

1633
01:31:42,661 --> 01:31:46,200
like 2 million years. What would cause
direct changes to the human body?

1634
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:50,610
What would cause direct changes to the,
the, the actual function of the mind.

1635
01:31:50,611 --> 01:31:54,330
Psilocybins like number one,
it's so common. It's everywhere.

1636
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,680
It grows out of a cow. Shit.
It's totally edible. You, you're,

1637
01:31:58,690 --> 01:32:02,320
you're hungry. You can eat it. You eat
it, you trip balls, you trip balls,

1638
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:05,260
you think about things, you
develop language, you develop.

1639
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:10,210
Have you done DMT? Oh yeah. I've never
done it and I'm dying to try it. Uh,

1640
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:14,410
do you Sturgill Simpson is, no, he, you
should check out his record. Accurate.

1641
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:17,770
It's new. And he has a song
called turtles all the way down,

1642
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:20,570
which I heard about this DMT, right? Well,

1643
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:24,700
he apparently he did a bunch of DMT
who's doing the record and was just like,

1644
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:28,300
yeah, there's this, that song itself
talks about DMT and silicide but,

1645
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:32,560
and stuff in it. But Eh, but
it's like really old school
country. It's got tattoos,

1646
01:32:32,561 --> 01:32:36,940
a DMT molecule. Really. I didn't know
this about you see, you know, see,

1647
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:41,760
I've never experienced it and I'm sorry,
I'm so into all that too. Oh my God.

1648
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:44,940
Let's get together and duty. Do teach.
Don't say it on the radio on the,

1649
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,120
I promise I won't bring any crank.
Well,

1650
01:32:49,121 --> 01:32:52,030
DMT is one of the weirdest ones too,
because you can never be tested for it.

1651
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:55,810
I mean, really they would
have to catch this one alone,

1652
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:57,700
that kind of an experience with anything.

1653
01:32:57,701 --> 01:33:00,430
I've done mushrooms before and
I laughed a lot. I've done acid,

1654
01:33:00,431 --> 01:33:01,840
I didn't really see anything but,

1655
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,670
but I'm very fascinated with like the
payout he kind of experience and all that.

1656
01:33:06,671 --> 01:33:11,260
And I've never, I've never, never had
it. Stirs was like you gotta try it dude.

1657
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:16,090
He's like Dmt is mushrooms times
a million plus aliens. Wow. Yeah.

1658
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:17,920
What's the deal with the aliens of DMT?

1659
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:21,630
Well, there's something that happens
when you take DMT, where you, you,

1660
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:26,790
you pass through visually or spiritually,
whether it's real or mentioned.

1661
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:30,960
You pass through into some new space
and when you're in some new space, the,

1662
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:34,180
what's weird about BMC all in your
head with your eyes shut or is this,

1663
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:35,850
your eyes are shot,
but if you open your eyes,

1664
01:33:35,851 --> 01:33:38,940
you're gonna see some crazy shit too.
You'll see some crazy shit though.

1665
01:33:38,941 --> 01:33:42,090
That's also, you're better off
keeping your eyes closed though.

1666
01:33:42,091 --> 01:33:44,930
Cause then you'll get sort of
a full representation of what,

1667
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:48,420
what's going on and what you're seeing.
When your eyes are open,

1668
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:50,700
your eyes are taking
in the physical world,

1669
01:33:50,701 --> 01:33:53,700
like what you're seeing in front of you
and you're trying to combine the two of

1670
01:33:53,701 --> 01:33:57,330
them and it's very baffling, is
better. Just shut your silent darkness,

1671
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,520
close your eyes,
take it,

1672
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:04,260
and then just close your eyes and lay
back and you go on the craziest trip.

1673
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:08,190
It's, it's impossible to it
for anything to be stronger.

1674
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:13,430
It's impossible for anything to be a more
potent hallucination because it seems

1675
01:34:13,861 --> 01:34:17,460
more real than reality itself.
Like once you, once you do DMT,

1676
01:34:17,461 --> 01:34:21,140
the weirdest thing about it is
coming back like regular realities,

1677
01:34:21,141 --> 01:34:25,650
so dry and doll. It's like
that's more real. Like it's more,

1678
01:34:25,651 --> 01:34:29,010
you feel it. You also feel,
if this makes any sense,

1679
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:31,260
you feel the experience in your,

1680
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:35,400
in your essence and your in your essence
as a human and it sticks with you after.

1681
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:36,481
Fuck man,

1682
01:34:36,481 --> 01:34:40,290
I've had trips that stuck with me for
five or six years where every day I would

1683
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:44,330
think about that trip for five or
six years. Wow Man. This, that's,

1684
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:47,610
I'm very fascinated by this
man. Well, it's the very,

1685
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,050
the very components of your,
the brain itself, the very,

1686
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:56,820
the very human neural transmitters,
that power thinking that,

1687
01:34:56,821 --> 01:35:00,680
that work inside your mind mean
these are endogenous chemicals.

1688
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:01,723
These aren't like,

1689
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:05,840
it's not like something that's alien to
the human body that you put in and it

1690
01:35:05,841 --> 01:35:10,400
has this crazy effect. No DMT is
actually produced by your body itself.

1691
01:35:10,401 --> 01:35:13,130
So when you add it,
when you take it and smoke it,

1692
01:35:13,131 --> 01:35:14,870
like your body already knows what it is.

1693
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:19,310
It's one of the reasons why
it's so transient. Like,
um, it's when you take it,

1694
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:20,870
you have this extreme high,

1695
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:26,020
you have this wild ride of hallucinations
and experiences or whatever it is and

1696
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:27,770
how long dimensions.
That's the crazy thing.

1697
01:35:27,771 --> 01:35:32,300
15 minutes Max you do at time,
which goes like a short thing.

1698
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:35,950
But that's more if you do it
intravenously, if you do it intravenously,

1699
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:39,920
can last like a half hour or more.
Really? Yeah. Like Rick Strassman,

1700
01:35:39,921 --> 01:35:44,690
who was the guy who, um, he was one
of the first guys to get federal.

1701
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:48,290
Um, he got, um, federal permission,

1702
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:53,500
the Da's permission to do these
research studies on dimethyltryptamine

1703
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:54,860
intravenously and patients.

1704
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,970
He did it out of the University of New
Mexico and they did a, several of these.

1705
01:35:58,971 --> 01:36:01,070
And then they did it.
He wrote a book on it called DMT,

1706
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:04,880
the spirit molecule where these
people at these incredible,

1707
01:36:04,881 --> 01:36:09,881
incredible experiences while on this
intravenous diamond field tryptamine and a

1708
01:36:10,071 --> 01:36:13,160
repeatable experiences, they
would go to these and very, very,

1709
01:36:13,161 --> 01:36:17,750
very much mirrored the alien abduction
experiences that people would talk about,

1710
01:36:17,751 --> 01:36:22,340
like being taken the board
alien spacecrafts and being
brought to alien places

1711
01:36:22,341 --> 01:36:25,380
and alien lands, like very,
very similar reb tiles. Yeah.

1712
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:27,050
So he started connecting uh,

1713
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:31,340
dimethyltryptamine and endogenous dumps
of dimethyltryptamine to alien abduction

1714
01:36:31,341 --> 01:36:33,710
experiences. And that's what
he thinks that's all about.

1715
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:35,930
He thinks all of these
people that have these,

1716
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:38,720
like I woke up the middle of the night
and I was on a space ship. You just,

1717
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,950
your brain just dumped a bunch of DMT
in and somehow or another you got caught

1718
01:36:42,951 --> 01:36:47,420
in the middle of this world
of being awake and dreaming.

1719
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:52,550
So your body when you're dreaming is
essentially producing something that's

1720
01:36:52,551 --> 01:36:56,210
causing you to hallucinate. The
speculation is that that's DMT as well.

1721
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:59,330
They haven't totally proven that yet,

1722
01:36:59,331 --> 01:37:03,530
but they're pretty sure they've already
proven that DMT is produced by the

1723
01:37:03,531 --> 01:37:06,950
pineal gland. That's, that was a
long time for, that was speculation,

1724
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:11,450
but they proved that that in live rats
that live rats actually produce DMT in

1725
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:16,000
that glance. That's really,
yeah, it's all pretty trippy,
trippy, trippy shit. That's,

1726
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:20,660
that is very fascinating. I mean,
like I said, I honestly haven't,

1727
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:24,620
uh, I haven't, I haven't, I've
just never, I've guided to do it.

1728
01:37:24,621 --> 01:37:28,250
I've just never done it. I, I'm just
into that man. I'm into that experience.

1729
01:37:28,251 --> 01:37:32,490
I'm into that like go into
the next level US wheat.

1730
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:37,100
So yeah, this is one of the, it's
one of the weirdest ones because a,

1731
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:40,790
it's in so many different plants.
It's not like a,

1732
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:44,450
you have to go and get a
pomegranate from Brazil.

1733
01:37:44,451 --> 01:37:49,430
And that's the only way you
get this. What's the walkout?
Iowaska. Iowaska. Yeah.

1734
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:53,810
IOWASCA is essentially the way they
get out all that shit. Like, yeah,

1735
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:54,830
like the movie.
Yeah.

1736
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,960
Well what Iowasca is an orally
active form of DMT because DMT,

1737
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:03,810
when you smoke it, it goes directly
into your breads, your blood supply.

1738
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:08,811
But DMT is in so many different plants
that if you got it from eating it,

1739
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:10,560
you would be tripping your balls.

1740
01:38:10,561 --> 01:38:13,940
That every time you have a salad
because grass has it in it.

1741
01:38:13,941 --> 01:38:17,850
A lot of different thousands of different
plants evidence. So because of that,

1742
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:18,510
your,
your,

1743
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:22,380
your body produces chemicals that mitigate
that and one of them is called Mano

1744
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:26,130
Amy and Oxidase and Mano Aiming
Oxidase is produced in your gut.

1745
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:28,870
So when the Amazon,
uh,

1746
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:33,920
schamens figure out how to give people
DMT with a sleek and modern like in

1747
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:38,940
today, and you know, United
States and modern chemical world,

1748
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:42,570
there's scientists that have figured
out how to synthesize pure DMT.

1749
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:46,860
So they'd take it from plants or you know,
from various chemicals.

1750
01:38:46,861 --> 01:38:50,820
And they synthesize pure DMT. You smoke,
it goes right into your bloodstream.

1751
01:38:50,821 --> 01:38:54,270
It's pure DMT.
But you can't do that in the Amazon.

1752
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:58,170
So what they figured out how to do is
make an orally active version of it.

1753
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:02,760
So what it is is they combined the leaves
of one plant with the roots of another

1754
01:39:02,761 --> 01:39:06,930
and one of them being harming,
which is a natural Mao inhibitor.

1755
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:10,230
So it's a mano Amy and oxidase
inhibitor that they mix in.

1756
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:15,330
So it's a like a DMT trip,
but it's not quite as intense.

1757
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,820
It's s it's a slow release,

1758
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:21,960
longer version that's very hallucinogenic,
very spiritual, a lot of ways.

1759
01:39:21,961 --> 01:39:25,140
But I've only done the big one.

1760
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,230
The big one is the DMT.

1761
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:32,200
The smoking DMT is you get shot
through a cannon to the center,

1762
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:33,150
the fucking universe.

1763
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:37,860
The way I describe it as
you're communicating with
complex geometric patterns

1764
01:39:37,861 --> 01:39:41,340
that are made out of love and
understanding. Man, that's so funny.

1765
01:39:41,341 --> 01:39:45,270
Cause I've heard that. I've heard the
geometrics thing and, and you know I'm a,

1766
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:49,860
I'm a big study of like safe, sacred
geometry and all these kinds of things.

1767
01:39:49,861 --> 01:39:52,560
I'm very fascinated by this.
I'm very fascinated. Oh,

1768
01:39:52,561 --> 01:39:54,480
I'm so fascinated by geometry,

1769
01:39:54,481 --> 01:39:58,650
sacred geometry and fractals and
all those different, when you,

1770
01:39:58,651 --> 01:40:01,170
when you look at that,
just the nature of the universe itself,

1771
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:04,680
it's just the nature of cellular life,
subatomic particles.

1772
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:07,620
Adam's becoming individuals,

1773
01:40:07,621 --> 01:40:11,460
individuals being a part of a group
of individuals that live in a planet,

1774
01:40:11,461 --> 01:40:12,960
the planet being a part of the galaxy,

1775
01:40:12,961 --> 01:40:15,780
the galaxy being a part of the universe
on and on and on. I don't know.

1776
01:40:15,781 --> 01:40:17,970
I'm not like,
like it seems like there's a,

1777
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:21,600
there's a fractal geometric
nature to life itself.

1778
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:24,440
The FIBONACCI sequence that
describes like, you know,

1779
01:40:24,441 --> 01:40:29,100
like the way sunflower seeds or
develop the way a nautilus shell looks,

1780
01:40:29,101 --> 01:40:31,770
the way so many different plants grow.

1781
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:36,240
There's all this weird sort of really
don't mathematical nature to the world

1782
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:41,220
itself and like the tree
of life 33 you know,

1783
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,970
it's just, there's so many things like
that. I'm so fascinated with that.

1784
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,081
I feel like when you,

1785
01:40:46,081 --> 01:40:48,960
when you unlock those kinds of things
in your mind and your end of that stuff,

1786
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:51,600
like there's a great book called
gateway to the Gods that I ran.

1787
01:40:51,601 --> 01:40:55,270
I don't know how I ran across this
book. It's, it's about this guy.

1788
01:40:55,480 --> 01:41:00,090
It's about a lot of sacred geometry. It
talks about, uh, it really deals with the,

1789
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:03,970
the in the Bible, like the watchers and
the Nephilim and the concept of that.

1790
01:41:03,971 --> 01:41:08,960
Angels w that we're actually like
interdimensional travel and it deal,

1791
01:41:08,961 --> 01:41:11,350
it touches a little bit on
the DMT ish kind of thing.

1792
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:14,890
And it touches on some of that
kind of travel, mine travel.

1793
01:41:14,891 --> 01:41:18,900
But I'm very fascinated by
it, man. I just, I, you know,

1794
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:22,720
I think if your mind's open to it
and you do do something that I DMT,

1795
01:41:22,721 --> 01:41:25,990
it probably, it probably
enhances your, if you're like,

1796
01:41:25,991 --> 01:41:29,200
you being so knowledgeable
on so much of this,

1797
01:41:29,201 --> 01:41:33,160
probably has it enhanced your trip
when you do it because you're, I mean,

1798
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:35,710
I don't know how it probably,
I mean, are you like,

1799
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:39,460
are you able to focus on what you're
looking at or wherever you're super hard,

1800
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:43,300
so hard.
It's so crazy and it changes every second.

1801
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:46,540
Every second you look at it,
it becomes something even more impossible.

1802
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,010
That's the weirdest thing about it.

1803
01:41:48,011 --> 01:41:51,580
It's just you can't believe you're
seeing something that's like this.

1804
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:56,560
Like how is this possible or there aren't
there like enter beings that more than

1805
01:41:56,561 --> 01:41:58,540
one person that I've seen
and they're all the same.

1806
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:02,680
They all described them as the same.
See, it's hard to do that. I've seen,

1807
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:05,050
see my trips have been different
every time I've done it.

1808
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,920
That's one of the weirdest things about
it is like someone saying that they've

1809
01:42:08,921 --> 01:42:11,920
seen the same things that I've seen. I'm
not even sure I can tell you what I saw.

1810
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:15,160
Like I can tell you what I
can remember about what I saw,

1811
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:18,850
but one of the weirdest aspects
of it is that it's impossible.

1812
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,370
Like when you're seeing it,
like this isn't real.

1813
01:42:21,371 --> 01:42:26,030
This can't be possible that I can
actually see this. And then like one,

1814
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:29,400
one of the things that one of my trips,
one of the most profound ones, um,

1815
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:34,390
there was like these like
almost like children that
were in this, this dimension,

1816
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:37,030
children that were like infinitely
more intelligent than me,

1817
01:42:37,031 --> 01:42:40,990
but behave like children and communicated
like children. And they would say,

1818
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:43,720
I love you.
600 million,

1819
01:42:43,721 --> 01:42:47,590
500,000 times like something like a kid
would say like, I love you infinity,

1820
01:42:47,591 --> 01:42:52,200
I love you. 50 million south
700,015 like you know, like shit.

1821
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:56,020
They would say that. And then they would
go look at this. And they kept saying,

1822
01:42:56,021 --> 01:42:57,910
look at this. And every time
they would say, look at this,

1823
01:42:57,911 --> 01:43:01,390
they would show you something
that was so impossibly beautiful.

1824
01:43:01,391 --> 01:43:06,040
Like tears were like flowing down my
face because I was conscious. I was,

1825
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:08,200
I had my eyes closed and I was
seeing this and I was conscious,

1826
01:43:08,201 --> 01:43:11,620
but I was crying because it
was so beautiful. And then
they would say it again.

1827
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:16,330
I love you. 600 million,
500,000 times, look at this.

1828
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:18,640
And then they would show you
something even more insane,

1829
01:43:18,641 --> 01:43:23,200
like a million times more insane.
What? She didn't make any sense.

1830
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:24,830
It was just,
you can't describe it.

1831
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:29,850
It just the fractal nature of
the universe embodied in imagery,

1832
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:35,530
which also had meaning and love connected
to it. So when you were seeing it,

1833
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,950
you weren't just seeing something
beautiful but you were feeling it.

1834
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:41,830
And it was like almost like it
was running through your soul,

1835
01:43:41,831 --> 01:43:43,870
like it was cleansing you as you saw it.

1836
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:47,110
Like everything that I saw
made me every time I saw it,

1837
01:43:47,111 --> 01:43:50,830
every new thing made me love people more.
May me Love Life,

1838
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:54,080
may be more appreciative,
made me want to hug more.

1839
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,900
And then I thought that was over it and
it would it go look at this and then

1840
01:43:56,901 --> 01:44:00,900
you'd get hit with a new wave and it
was just overwhelming. I'm just crying.

1841
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:05,520
I couldn't, couldn't hold it in. It
was just so unbelievably intense.

1842
01:44:05,521 --> 01:44:08,390
It had a negative experience.
No, not on DMT now.

1843
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:11,070
I've had never had negative
experiences in that. Um,

1844
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:15,020
DMT is sort of exposed that I was maybe
a little out of control of my life,

1845
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:19,150
like maybe too stressed out or maybe uh,
you know,

1846
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:24,500
taking too much time, devoted too much
time to work and bullshit related things.

1847
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:25,940
It really didn't matter in the long,
like,

1848
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:29,390
like the negative aspect was it like
after it was over, it's like, hey,

1849
01:44:29,391 --> 01:44:33,800
I need to just fucking chill out.
Like I need to just smelled the daisies.

1850
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:38,750
I need to just enjoy this
experience, you know? And this, wow.

1851
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:41,300
Not 15 minutes. Yeah, but wasn't,

1852
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:45,050
I've never had a negative experience in
that. Like while it was in, it was like,

1853
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:48,200
this is negative, but I've seen it.
I've seen people freak out. You have,

1854
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:49,630
have you been with
someone that freaked out?

1855
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,980
My friend Eddie freaked the fuck
out the first time he did it,

1856
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:56,070
but I think it was because he was trying
to control it. You can't control it.

1857
01:44:56,071 --> 01:44:57,410
You can't,
you can't like saying,

1858
01:44:57,411 --> 01:45:01,430
I'm going to pull myself out of this and
sober up. Good luck. You have to give in.

1859
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:02,870
You have to be willing to give in.

1860
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:06,550
But I mean, I'm, that's the thing
is man, it's like I'm, I'm that,

1861
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:11,210
I think you and I are a lot alike in that
way. That it's like, like I, you know,

1862
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:15,560
I want something more out of this
experience. Like I love, I love life.

1863
01:45:15,561 --> 01:45:19,580
Like I'm a positive guy. I've got two kids
who I love. I love the time with them,

1864
01:45:19,581 --> 01:45:21,930
you know, everything like
that. And that's why it's like,

1865
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:24,360
I'm so fascinated with like the,
hey,

1866
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:27,200
I don't believe all the bullshit on
the media and I don't believe all the

1867
01:45:27,201 --> 01:45:29,930
fucking, you know, all the shit that
we've been talking about this whole show.

1868
01:45:29,931 --> 01:45:32,870
Like that's why I'm into the bitcoin
thing, which we didn't even gotten into.

1869
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:37,700
And I'm, I'm mind those things. I'm into
the technology of it. Am I am. Yeah, I do.

1870
01:45:38,270 --> 01:45:40,280
I mean, I'm just into the
technology of it. I'm into the,

1871
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:45,020
to the programming side of it, in the,
in the cryptology and all that. But,

1872
01:45:45,530 --> 01:45:47,590
uh,
but like I,

1873
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:52,600
I am into understanding the full
aspect of life while I'm here and,

1874
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:58,400
and it's like I'm fascinated by religions
and I, my mom, I was raised Christian,

1875
01:45:58,401 --> 01:46:02,630
my mom's that way. Like I, I, you
know, it's hard for me to say that I'm,

1876
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:06,380
that I'm like, uh, I'm not a church
going Kinda guy, but, but it's like,

1877
01:46:06,381 --> 01:46:09,040
I believe when you're here,
you're supposed to be you.

1878
01:46:09,041 --> 01:46:13,070
If you could leave being good, you
know, and I haven't been a good guy,

1879
01:46:13,071 --> 01:46:13,641
that's the thing.

1880
01:46:13,641 --> 01:46:18,641
But I'm into the knowledge I'm into like
discovering where things come from and

1881
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:19,940
you know,

1882
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:24,330
studying like the Egyptians and studying
the fucking artwork that they're always,

1883
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:27,200
you know, I'm just into it. So
that's why like semantic DMT, like,

1884
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:32,120
like if I could travel to other dimensions
and party with reptiles I was doing

1885
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,560
right now.
You can.

1886
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:36,500
Yeah. Well you can with DMT.
I don't know about reptiles,

1887
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:38,600
I've never seen a reptile while on it,

1888
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:43,040
but I've seen things that are somehow
or another consciousness or appear to be

1889
01:46:43,041 --> 01:46:48,041
conscious or are representations of your
own consciousness and some sort of a

1890
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:52,470
much have much, a much
greater form. But you know,

1891
01:46:52,471 --> 01:46:55,740
who else was in a church going person.
Jesus.

1892
01:46:56,450 --> 01:46:58,500
See Jesus didn't have a fucking church.

1893
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:02,190
Churches are human creations and humans.

1894
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:05,170
The problem with any sort
of power structure, um,

1895
01:47:05,190 --> 01:47:10,020
any top down power structure is that
people want to contain that once,

1896
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:12,150
once they have power,
they want to retain that power.

1897
01:47:12,151 --> 01:47:15,210
They want to contain the
people that contained the
ideologies of the people that

1898
01:47:15,211 --> 01:47:19,470
are involved in that group. And then
you know, to have a, an open minded,

1899
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:24,090
completely open situation where you have
a group but there's no structure to it

1900
01:47:24,091 --> 01:47:26,460
and everyone's just loving and
able to do whatever they want.

1901
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:30,510
There's no one person that's the leader.
No, that's not what we do. Human beings.

1902
01:47:30,511 --> 01:47:34,980
Everything sort of falls into that
weird Alpha male monkey category where

1903
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:37,980
there's one person that talks
and everyone else listens.

1904
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:42,090
And that's what you find in churches.
That's what you find at political rallies.

1905
01:47:42,091 --> 01:47:45,300
That's what you find when the
president gives a speech on television,

1906
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:49,200
there's the one and then there's the
listeners and is, it's not a dialogue,

1907
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:53,040
it's one person talks and there's a, you
know, everyone comes in and sits down,

1908
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:56,690
open up to page three 24 we're going to
read from the Gospel. And then it was,

1909
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:59,040
but this was one person that's doing this.

1910
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:03,810
It's one person that's guiding this whole
thing and that's sort of contrary to

1911
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:08,760
the very like nature of like a
cooperative and open group of humans.

1912
01:48:08,761 --> 01:48:09,900
A a community.

1913
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:14,910
And that's also the best way to control
people to ensure that this one person

1914
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,110
disseminates the rules.

1915
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:20,060
It's one person gets to talk and this one
person keeps everybody in a control of

1916
01:48:20,061 --> 01:48:24,120
the preachers here. Everyone all rise.
The honorable judge is here, you know,

1917
01:48:24,121 --> 01:48:26,050
all the, I mean, court court itself,

1918
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,830
you have to stand up when this
asshole who's wearing robes,

1919
01:48:28,831 --> 01:48:31,110
like why you wearing
robes, man, you can't,

1920
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:34,650
you can't give the law out
with a tee shirt and jeans on.

1921
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,320
You have to wear like
special fancy clothes.

1922
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:39,300
And in order to to understand the law,

1923
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:43,860
the way the powdered wigs better way
crazy curly white wigs, you know,

1924
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,140
people are mad,
they're mad,

1925
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:51,170
and they're also running on momentum of
an ignorant past running on the momentum

1926
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:55,110
essentially of people that we used
to write shit down on animal skins.

1927
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:59,160
That same momentum is still
propelling society. So, yeah.

1928
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:03,580
Yeah. And it's, yeah, you're
right. You're right. It's, I mean,

1929
01:49:03,581 --> 01:49:07,000
we could get into that forever because
I've, you know, just conceptually,

1930
01:49:07,001 --> 01:49:11,350
the way that the control
is, is, is, you know,

1931
01:49:11,351 --> 01:49:16,300
doled out, it's pretty pretty. I mean,
it's pretty easy. It's pretty math,

1932
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:20,110
mathematical one plus one equals two.
Like you just like I was saying,

1933
01:49:20,111 --> 01:49:22,090
you keep the, keep, keep everybody pour,

1934
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:25,990
keep everybody uneducated
and then convinced them that
if they don't do what we

1935
01:49:25,991 --> 01:49:28,030
want them to do,
they're going to burn in hell.

1936
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:31,570
Yeah. Even better than poor. Now they have
a new thing. It's called being in debt.

1937
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:32,890
Yeah.
Everyone's in debt.

1938
01:49:32,891 --> 01:49:36,820
It's way better than poor because poor
you could just deal with being poor,

1939
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:40,660
but debt you never going to have, you
can't stop working. You owe money.

1940
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:44,070
You're not even, yeah, that's
true. That's exactly it, man. Man.

1941
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:47,430
It's like, you know, separate
the family. Have you, uh,

1942
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:51,700
you're getting the bright eyes that
man pride eyes know Conor Oberst.

1943
01:49:51,701 --> 01:49:54,520
Have you heard of him? No.
You know that those guys,

1944
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:58,540
they have a great record called the
people's key, but the, uh, the opening,

1945
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:03,160
the opening La, the opening thing is this
guy, I don't even know who it is. He's,

1946
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:05,980
he's talking about exactly what
we're talking about it and how they,

1947
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:08,140
how they control the masses and stuff.
Man,

1948
01:50:08,141 --> 01:50:11,080
it's a great speech in the beginning
of this thing. But you know,

1949
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:14,650
it's like keeping like keeping the mom
and dad separate because they both have

1950
01:50:14,651 --> 01:50:15,700
to work.
Like,

1951
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:20,720
can you make it so hard for a normal
like lower income family to even be

1952
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:25,690
together so that you can disseminate
information to each one of them? Exactly.

1953
01:50:25,691 --> 01:50:28,260
Like you want it and they don't have
a lot of time together. You know,

1954
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:32,500
that's a big part of it and it's, it's
so insane. It's just, it just is insane.

1955
01:50:33,330 --> 01:50:37,360
It just like the wages and the way they
control that and the people who make the

1956
01:50:37,361 --> 01:50:39,820
money. It's like, like the banking thing.

1957
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,910
This is why the bitcoin thing is so
brilliant. I mean, you know, I mean,

1958
01:50:42,911 --> 01:50:46,900
you talked to the, to uh, Andrea's
who's like, he's like the man,

1959
01:50:46,901 --> 01:50:48,130
but um,

1960
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:52,660
Andreas Antonopoulos who we were talking
about this before the podcast left that

1961
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:56,350
bitcoin foundation. Yeah. I don't,
we need to have him on again.

1962
01:50:56,351 --> 01:50:58,000
Find out what that was all,
what that is.

1963
01:50:58,001 --> 01:51:01,480
See that the foundation has never been
needed. This is what's weird about it,

1964
01:51:01,481 --> 01:51:05,040
because they've, they're, you know,
the bitcoin itself is the protocol.

1965
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:06,760
So it's like,
that's what's brilliant.

1966
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:11,440
The foundation was created as something
that was supposed to kind of drive the

1967
01:51:11,441 --> 01:51:15,790
development of it, but it's become,
it's become a corporation essentially.

1968
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:19,150
You know, it's, it's got a, had
a lot of negative, uh, but the,

1969
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:23,110
the people who were in charge of
it now, or even more, more so,

1970
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,960
people are like,
they're kind of crooks and shady and,

1971
01:51:26,230 --> 01:51:28,630
but there's really no need for it.
There's no need. There's not like,

1972
01:51:28,631 --> 01:51:31,840
there's a bit coin company that
people work for. You know, the thing,

1973
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:35,590
it's like more like a virus that was set
into the world and then just like the

1974
01:51:35,591 --> 01:51:37,070
Internet was, you know,
there's not like the,

1975
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:40,360
they're an internet company that there's
the president of the Internet who can

1976
01:51:40,361 --> 01:51:42,760
decide like that today.
But you know what I mean?

1977
01:51:42,761 --> 01:51:45,400
That's a beautiful thing about the
internet, isn't it? It is amazing,

1978
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,440
but that's why they're trying to do this,
this,

1979
01:51:47,441 --> 01:51:50,530
this net neutrality thing is such a
big issue because they're trying to,

1980
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:54,430
they're trying to can't, like right
now time Warner cable can already,

1981
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,950
like if they don't like
the Joe Rogan show,

1982
01:51:57,310 --> 01:52:00,820
they can slow down when
people go to your site,

1983
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:06,280
they can slow it down on purpose, but,
but that's, that's shitty enough already.

1984
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:10,120
But like with the net neutrality
thing they're trying to get rid of,

1985
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:15,180
then then time Warner can say, hey, um,

1986
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,290
Google, we're, Shit's going to be
real slow unless you pay us money.

1987
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:24,490
And so then they're going to start
extorting money out of, do you know,

1988
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:26,800
to go back into their own
pocket to actually do,

1989
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:30,850
to alter what sites and even
blocking sites and that and when,

1990
01:52:30,851 --> 01:52:34,060
when Time Warner owns all the internet,

1991
01:52:34,061 --> 01:52:36,720
I mean there's a giant portion
of the Internet. I mean,

1992
01:52:36,721 --> 01:52:39,760
I don't know what the actual numbers are,
but it's over 50% of the,

1993
01:52:39,761 --> 01:52:44,761
of the service provider and the service
provider can then charge companies and

1994
01:52:45,171 --> 01:52:49,670
decide what people can see.
Then that's like the Internet is the,

1995
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,410
the purpose of it is, is you're getting
fucked big time. You know what I mean?

1996
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,680
They're trying to corporatize it.

1997
01:52:54,681 --> 01:52:57,380
They're trying to control it the same
way they've controlled the airwaves.

1998
01:52:57,780 --> 01:53:02,450
Like CBS chipped and they cut,
they cut the internet, you know,

1999
01:53:02,451 --> 01:53:06,080
and shit like that. That's what we're
like three steps away from happening.

2000
01:53:06,081 --> 01:53:08,660
And that's, that's the Internet.
The Internet is decentralized.

2001
01:53:08,661 --> 01:53:11,990
There is no one in charge of it.
And they know that, you know,

2002
01:53:11,991 --> 01:53:15,070
and the reality is is like if they,
if you know,

2003
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:17,210
if time Warner becomes that big of a deal,

2004
01:53:17,211 --> 01:53:20,630
somebody will come out there and run
their own wires and fucking set up their

2005
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:25,160
own fucking statewide wifi and
it'll be fine, you know? But it, it,

2006
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:27,290
it's just tough man.
But you know that like,

2007
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:31,870
did you ever get into discussion about
bitcoin? About how you can use the in a,

2008
01:53:31,871 --> 01:53:32,690
in a,

2009
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:36,260
if I send you money you can attach a
message to it or you could actually like

2010
01:53:36,261 --> 01:53:39,170
attach a deed or I could write a song
and it would be in the blockchain

2011
01:53:39,171 --> 01:53:42,680
copyrighted, but you can actually
embed a message in the transaction.

2012
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:43,670
And that the first,

2013
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:47,690
the first transaction ever done
by the guy who made it had the,

2014
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:52,430
the like Washington, like the Washington
Post or like Wall Street Journal.

2015
01:53:52,431 --> 01:53:57,350
The headline was like the government
approves second bailout for banks.

2016
01:53:57,490 --> 01:54:00,950
Like that was encoded in the first
transit transmission cause it was like

2017
01:54:00,951 --> 01:54:05,030
they're saying like enough,
like this shit is so fucked.

2018
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:08,380
The banking, the Federal Reserve,
the government, everything.

2019
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:12,260
Like we've got a solution that way
you don't need a banks anymore.

2020
01:54:12,261 --> 01:54:14,400
You know what I mean? You don't, I mean
it would change. It changes the escrow.

2021
01:54:14,401 --> 01:54:15,880
It changes everything like it.
Yeah.

2022
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:18,290
You don't need banks if
you have digital currency.

2023
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:22,910
I mean that's the most party is, is
the mining community. So like it's,

2024
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:27,380
there's no need, there's no way to rig
it, you know? Yeah. I think that if,

2025
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:32,330
if it can continue and
it can grow and evolve,

2026
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:35,630
I think it can be definitely,
well definitely I think it will as well.

2027
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:40,130
I think there's definitely powers that
are trying to solve or Horace Mann of

2028
01:54:40,131 --> 01:54:43,100
course, because can you imagine?
But, but here's the reality, man.

2029
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:48,550
Banks are record stores and our big
record companies and Bitcoin is Napster.

2030
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:53,900
That's it. That's what it is. When
you, what would the tower records, man,

2031
01:54:53,901 --> 01:54:56,180
I used to fucking go there
at all the fucking time.

2032
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:58,040
It's not there anymore and the,

2033
01:54:58,041 --> 01:55:01,460
and all of these fucking city national
banks on every corner that's going to

2034
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:03,740
happen. Mark my words, they
will not be there anymore.

2035
01:55:03,741 --> 01:55:06,860
That would be the same fate as tower
because people will figure out how to send

2036
01:55:06,861 --> 01:55:08,040
their money around, you know? Yeah.

2037
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:10,880
And once you get used to
buying things with your phone,

2038
01:55:10,881 --> 01:55:14,580
which is probably the future, and I do
it all, I bought a fucking computer.

2039
01:55:14,581 --> 01:55:17,300
Like I'm such a nerd that I buy old.

2040
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:21,290
I bought an old four 86 PC with like a
disk drive in it because I just wanted to

2041
01:55:21,291 --> 01:55:25,620
play my old games that I liked. I bought
one on my phone on the way in here. Wow.

2042
01:55:25,621 --> 01:55:26,870
I need on Ebay though.
I bet.

2043
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:30,290
But like that's paypal and you're like
paying all kinds of money for that.

2044
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:32,990
But like if you know,
I can go on right now.

2045
01:55:32,991 --> 01:55:37,550
I could go to anywhere and PR.
I mean right now,

2046
01:55:37,551 --> 01:55:39,770
like with Dell,
like start accepting bitcoin.

2047
01:55:39,771 --> 01:55:43,890
Like I bought my manager a computer like
with some bitcoin than I had and it was

2048
01:55:43,891 --> 01:55:47,280
fucking cheap and it was like
I sent Alex upset. Now Dell,

2049
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:49,850
it started accepting it just
recently. Wow. You know,

2050
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:52,260
overstock.com was the first one and now,

2051
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:57,290
now Wiki Wikipedia takes it for donations
and it's slowly becoming adopted.

2052
01:55:58,021 --> 01:56:02,550
And I think it's, you know,
back in [inaudible] 94 93
when the Internet was out,

2053
01:56:02,551 --> 01:56:04,350
people were like,
no one's ever going to do this.

2054
01:56:04,351 --> 01:56:07,920
www.somethingorother.com they're going
to have to come up with some easier way

2055
01:56:07,921 --> 01:56:12,240
to do it. No one's going to ever, this
will never become normal. And you know,

2056
01:56:12,530 --> 01:56:12,751
it's like,

2057
01:56:12,751 --> 01:56:16,410
here we are 20 years later and it's
like there's no way that anyone could

2058
01:56:16,411 --> 01:56:19,620
function. Any of our devices
could function without the
Internet being involved.

2059
01:56:19,621 --> 01:56:23,550
Everyone would prefer to go to
a website then call the number.

2060
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:27,450
It's like people download their music,
they don't buy it. Really. I mean they do.

2061
01:56:27,451 --> 01:56:30,450
But you know, I mean it's
like, so I think that the,

2062
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:33,930
all the talk around bitcoin right now is
the same kind of talk that we're having

2063
01:56:33,931 --> 01:56:36,110
around the internet then.
But I don't think it will be,

2064
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:40,980
there's like messaging programs, uh, where
you can send money in the, in the text,

2065
01:56:40,981 --> 01:56:43,650
like a on, on an iPhone.
So like if I was like,

2066
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:45,630
hey can you go pick up this and you know,

2067
01:56:45,631 --> 01:56:49,200
here's 40 bucks worth of it or whatever,
or you know, whatever it costs,

2068
01:56:49,201 --> 01:56:51,390
I can just send it to you
instantly and not being,

2069
01:56:51,391 --> 01:56:53,630
so you could just like say if I'm,

2070
01:56:54,770 --> 01:56:58,400
say if we were living together and you
wanted me to go pick up a steak, yeah.

2071
01:56:58,410 --> 01:57:02,220
Hey Man, your store. And go get some
food and here's the money. Yeah,

2072
01:57:02,230 --> 01:57:05,370
just like that. I mean there'd be
no, there's like a couple cents,

2073
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:08,580
maybe a charge for the transaction fee,
but there's,

2074
01:57:08,581 --> 01:57:12,810
I mean such an if there is one, it's such
a small amount and that money goes to,

2075
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:16,080
it's like a four o one k plan for
the mining system cause it's going to

2076
01:57:16,081 --> 01:57:18,570
eventually hit the mark
where it can't make anymore,

2077
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,250
can't generate any more bitcoin.

2078
01:57:20,251 --> 01:57:24,060
And then after that there'll be living
off the transaction fees. But um,

2079
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:27,360
it's kind of interesting to
see like the mining thing, man,

2080
01:57:27,361 --> 01:57:28,620
it's like some people
think of and they're like,

2081
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:31,590
oh it's like people who want to just
like make free money, which is not,

2082
01:57:31,591 --> 01:57:34,260
is not the way it works.
It's like what it actually is is,

2083
01:57:34,261 --> 01:57:38,730
and this is the nerd part of me. Like I
also run a full node, a bitcoin at home,

2084
01:57:38,731 --> 01:57:39,000
which,

2085
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,000
which means like I'm part of the
network of transactions that happen.

2086
01:57:44,431 --> 01:57:47,970
It's kind of complicated, but at
the same time like the, the, the,

2087
01:57:47,971 --> 01:57:51,810
the technology behind the whole
transaction confirming process,

2088
01:57:51,811 --> 01:57:55,350
which is the Aka the mining is what
is so fascinating to me. And I like,

2089
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,940
I mean I'll go on the Internet and uh,

2090
01:57:57,941 --> 01:58:01,260
an IRC and hang out and talk to the
developers and shit cause I'm just,

2091
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:06,500
I think that someone has to in is going
to use this technology in the way that

2092
01:58:07,351 --> 01:58:12,270
bitcoin is and make finally
a decentralized entertainment
distribution platform

2093
01:58:12,570 --> 01:58:17,570
because eventually like iTunes takes
30% like they've been good to me in

2094
01:58:17,881 --> 01:58:19,320
different moments.
But here's the reality.

2095
01:58:19,321 --> 01:58:22,920
You make something that costs nothing
to duplicate because digital and they're

2096
01:58:22,921 --> 01:58:25,830
taking 30% of it plus a
company like tune core,

2097
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:30,750
like jabs you in Rob's you to get eat to
even get your shit on iTunes if you're

2098
01:58:30,751 --> 01:58:34,290
just a new band. You know, he was like
I, how do I get measured on iTunes?

2099
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:38,940
Somebody going to collect some money
for them to just email your song over to

2100
01:58:38,941 --> 01:58:43,941
iTunes in the correct format and then
iTunes takes 30% like if you got rid of

2101
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:48,760
that and you've got it where I was like
I say I gave you a David Bowie song.

2102
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:52,300
If there was a way to just have a
proof of ownership and have like,

2103
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:55,870
like a transaction fee like
there is in bitcoin where I've,

2104
01:58:55,871 --> 01:59:00,871
I just gave you an album that would like
somehow pay David belly when you get

2105
01:59:02,651 --> 01:59:06,520
it. You know they're not there doesn't
need to be the, the, the Itunes,

2106
01:59:06,521 --> 01:59:08,350
the store you go to to get it.

2107
01:59:08,351 --> 01:59:11,350
It's like really if I'm
sending you a song via email,

2108
01:59:11,351 --> 01:59:13,420
there should be a way to like build it,

2109
01:59:13,570 --> 01:59:16,960
build a decentralized
distribution platform like that.

2110
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:22,120
It's crazy that Amazon takes that
much or if it takes that much,

2111
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:25,570
yeah. How can they do that? I'll
tell you why, because there was,

2112
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:29,350
everyone said the Internet is never going
to be a way that people buy music and

2113
01:59:29,351 --> 01:59:30,184
iTunes said,

2114
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:34,210
we're here and we're putting our flag
down and you guys are going to be sorry.

2115
01:59:34,211 --> 01:59:36,430
And that's what happened.
They jumped in when nobody cared.

2116
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:38,530
There were meetings that were,
they said, we don't care.

2117
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:41,290
Don't talk to us about
MP3. He's like, Sony said,

2118
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:44,740
don't talk to us about mp3s
until it's 30% of the market.

2119
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:48,700
And by the time it was 30% of the market,
iTunes was fucking,

2120
01:59:48,701 --> 01:59:53,701
Wa had iPods and it was weighed 30% seems
like a lot of money because it's not

2121
01:59:54,011 --> 01:59:57,160
even like they're storing it on their
website and then you download it from

2122
01:59:57,161 --> 02:00:00,340
their servers. Like they need all the
bandwidth. And so you're, you know,

2123
02:00:00,341 --> 02:00:04,760
because your album is, you know,
x amount of gigs that, I mean,

2124
02:00:04,761 --> 02:00:07,930
that's not what's going on.
They're not doing it. Well. I mean,

2125
02:00:08,330 --> 02:00:12,060
you have to have a host. They do store
it. I mean, well, they don't do it with,

2126
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,320
for podcasts,
for podcasts.

2127
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:18,070
Podcast gets downloaded from
a host like a torrent. Yeah,

2128
02:00:18,071 --> 02:00:21,130
I have a of a company called the
company's called Libsyn and Libsyn's.

2129
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:24,480
Tunecore is,
so that's what tune core.

2130
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:27,610
That's the way tune core or like
reverb nation and all those things.

2131
02:00:27,611 --> 02:00:30,760
Work is you can get yourself,
I mean that's essentially yet,

2132
02:00:30,761 --> 02:00:33,640
but I believe that it goes
into the back end and iTunes.

2133
02:00:33,641 --> 02:00:35,770
I think a lot of those companies,
like,

2134
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:41,550
like if I don't pay tune core,
after five years they're going to,

2135
02:00:41,551 --> 02:00:45,820
in my music will go off iTunes.
So like they have the control over that.

2136
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:48,790
But I've also seen labels
go directly to iTunes,

2137
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:53,530
not be those things and go use the
backend there. I mean, I, I dunno,

2138
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:56,440
I thought they did store the
shit, but you know, I mean,

2139
02:00:56,441 --> 02:01:00,370
I should probably know that and I don't
know that, but the reality is 30%,

2140
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:04,810
I don't care what you call it. [inaudible]
it's a duplicate of a digital file.

2141
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:09,730
Yeah. It cost nothing to replicate.
That is, it is kinda crazy.

2142
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:13,300
Yeah. That's why so many artists held
out for so long on it, but then they had,

2143
02:01:13,301 --> 02:01:14,470
they just buckled and went.

2144
02:01:14,471 --> 02:01:17,350
But I know that there's dirty deals and
went down in the back room where like,

2145
02:01:17,351 --> 02:01:21,100
like certain people got better cuts off
that. Like the Beatles, I bet you money,

2146
02:01:21,101 --> 02:01:24,490
they're not taking 30% of the vehicles,
but they would never admit to that.

2147
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:27,040
But dude, everything's a dirty
deal. Listen to this shit.

2148
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:30,040
Bilborough billboard charts. You
think about it, you're like, oh,

2149
02:01:30,041 --> 02:01:31,480
this album number one on billboard.

2150
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:36,910
There are certain artists that I've
heard about where they've had that like

2151
02:01:36,911 --> 02:01:41,270
sponsorships with like say
Coors light and the red,

2152
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:42,680
they're weak,
the record comes out.

2153
02:01:42,681 --> 02:01:47,240
Coors light buys 300,000 copies of
the record so that it goes number one.

2154
02:01:47,241 --> 02:01:50,810
I mean it's all rigged financially.
It's all rigged by money,

2155
02:01:50,811 --> 02:01:54,380
so it's like none of it's real. The
Grammy's aren't real, you know, it just,

2156
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:59,240
it's to me it's all sister the Gig.
The Grammy's aren't real. Yeah,

2157
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:02,820
none of that's real. Do you think any of
that's real? Do you know what way Paul?

2158
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:08,120
There are people that charge that are
services that are people that were at one

2159
02:02:08,121 --> 02:02:12,350
point worked for the Grammy Organization
and they have the email addresses of

2160
02:02:12,351 --> 02:02:13,790
all the people that they know that vote.

2161
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:19,150
So there are people that will charge you
like five grand to bombard these people

2162
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:23,930
with emails all year so that by the time
they see the voting sheet they're like,

2163
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:27,710
oh that fucking person, I'll
vote for that. Like there's,
there's things like that,

2164
02:02:27,711 --> 02:02:29,990
but besides that dude,

2165
02:02:29,991 --> 02:02:34,991
it's like the Grammy's are a self
contained operation of like the old media.

2166
02:02:35,061 --> 02:02:39,620
Like it's, it's like Clive Davis and all
those people and they're all like, like,

2167
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:45,380
like a random band from
nowhere who nobody's ever
heard of is never going to win

2168
02:02:45,381 --> 02:02:49,310
a grammy and less they've got money
behind them. Do you know what I mean?

2169
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:50,780
So like the whole show,

2170
02:02:50,781 --> 02:02:53,270
like what I mean like the billboards
are fake and all that shit.

2171
02:02:53,271 --> 02:02:55,280
All that Shit's not real.
It's not like,

2172
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:59,570
it's not like the 50s were like muddy
waters puts out something and it goes

2173
02:02:59,571 --> 02:03:02,810
straight to the top of the charts and
all of a sudden like race music becomes

2174
02:03:02,811 --> 02:03:04,670
like this big thing.
It's not that way anymore.

2175
02:03:04,671 --> 02:03:07,520
It's all corporate controlled by
the 1% it's controlled by the,

2176
02:03:07,521 --> 02:03:10,670
by coms of the world who are putting
it on the television, who are,

2177
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:12,440
who are deciding who's going to win.

2178
02:03:12,441 --> 02:03:16,250
Like arcade fire wins a fucking grammy
because they think that that like,

2179
02:03:16,251 --> 02:03:18,810
you know, everyone feels like
it's been two pop away in it,

2180
02:03:18,811 --> 02:03:21,230
so let's give one to arcade
fire this year. And it's like,

2181
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:23,090
as much as I want to
believe that there are,

2182
02:03:23,091 --> 02:03:27,110
like the fans are in any way
involved in these kinds of processes.

2183
02:03:27,111 --> 02:03:29,450
They're totally not, it's just
all the marketing. There's,

2184
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:33,440
there's fucking five people calling all
the radio station programming for the

2185
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:34,440
year. There's, you know,

2186
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:38,750
people buying their way to the top of the
buying grammys and buying their way to

2187
02:03:38,751 --> 02:03:41,120
the top of the billboard.
It's like if everybody's,

2188
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:45,050
if rich people are the only people that
have the ability to buy their way in top,

2189
02:03:45,051 --> 02:03:48,560
like why would, why would some,
why would muddy waters even care?

2190
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:52,160
Do you know what I mean? But it's just
the system has changed so much like,

2191
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:57,500
but that isn't that just the system as
far as like the awards and award shows

2192
02:03:57,501 --> 02:04:00,980
and Samsung and all those kinds of things
that the accolades that that go along

2193
02:04:00,981 --> 02:04:03,110
with being a musician, like the, you know,

2194
02:04:03,111 --> 02:04:05,840
going out and playing a show
and having a grassroots thing.

2195
02:04:05,841 --> 02:04:07,370
Like that's one thing that's real,

2196
02:04:07,371 --> 02:04:11,120
but like all the accolades that the
billboards and the awards and all that,

2197
02:04:11,121 --> 02:04:15,410
all that stuff is just for show
and it's highly manipulated so,

2198
02:04:15,710 --> 02:04:18,530
well it makes sense. I mean
it totally makes sense. Move.

2199
02:04:18,531 --> 02:04:21,050
Why wouldn't they manipulate
it if they could manipulate it?

2200
02:04:21,051 --> 02:04:24,440
If it led to financial gain? Of course,
if they're scratching each other's backs,

2201
02:04:24,441 --> 02:04:25,274
like,
you know,

2202
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:28,900
kind of Davis is going to make a record
and he's going to give it to the, to the,

2203
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:32,750
when they go to their Bohemian Grove
little party that they do or whatever,

2204
02:04:32,751 --> 02:04:36,370
they're going to fucking,
he's going to say, Hey, I'm
going to send you the new, uh,

2205
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:38,280
you know,
Kanye record or whatever,

2206
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:42,150
miss any of the new Alicia Keyes record
and it's radio stations are going to

2207
02:04:42,151 --> 02:04:45,980
fucking, you know, they're gonna get,
you know, they're not getting Pale love,

2208
02:04:45,981 --> 02:04:48,930
but they're fucking getting free trips
to Disneyland for their whole family and

2209
02:04:48,931 --> 02:04:50,100
like five of the people you know,

2210
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:53,520
don't fucking play like this record
that sound says invested in. So

2211
02:04:55,170 --> 02:04:57,930
to me it's all a kind of a joke.
And that's probably why I'm not,

2212
02:04:57,931 --> 02:05:01,260
why I'm not a rich man is
because I fucking, I mount,

2213
02:05:01,261 --> 02:05:05,190
I spout off about this shit all the time
on my radio show too. And I'm like, like,

2214
02:05:05,610 --> 02:05:09,210
fucking, where's your, what's
your radio show on Sirius?

2215
02:05:09,211 --> 02:05:13,740
On Sirius Xm on a outlaw
country? A channel 60. I'm on.

2216
02:05:13,770 --> 02:05:17,790
Is that the xxx channels? I would, it
is, oh, let's call it electric Rodeo.

2217
02:05:17,791 --> 02:05:21,460
The triple x thing was something
where I was trying to actually, uh,

2218
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:24,870
it's kind of defunct in a way now. I
mean, I still play all those bands,

2219
02:05:24,871 --> 02:05:29,190
but there's this whole like underground
country underground kind of roots blues

2220
02:05:29,191 --> 02:05:33,420
thing that was happening and it was
getting boxed into this Americana Shit.

2221
02:05:33,421 --> 02:05:36,150
It was getting real, like Americana
and contrary and everything.

2222
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:39,600
There was this real big gap in the
middle and there was all these bands that

2223
02:05:39,601 --> 02:05:41,160
were falling in the gap.
So I was like,

2224
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:45,810
I started a website with that and it was
kind of just a play on triple a radio.

2225
02:05:45,811 --> 02:05:49,380
And I was like, I don't know. I
got more heat over it. I mean,

2226
02:05:49,381 --> 02:05:51,600
it helped a lot of artists
and I know it did because,

2227
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:54,900
because I'm friends with
them and it definitely, I, I,

2228
02:05:55,450 --> 02:05:58,500
I've now started producing a lot of
other people and started working in the

2229
02:05:58,501 --> 02:06:01,680
studio with them more as
opposed to promoting them,
which has been really good.

2230
02:06:01,681 --> 02:06:02,730
But,
um,

2231
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:06,120
it was just a way of trying to promote
all these really great bands that really

2232
02:06:06,121 --> 02:06:08,970
just weren't getting any chance.
But I still play.

2233
02:06:08,971 --> 02:06:12,060
All those bands were ready to show,
but it's called electric Rodeo.

2234
02:06:12,061 --> 02:06:14,820
I've been doing like nine years now,
which is kind of insane.

2235
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:17,970
But I don't do it like this. I
do it on the fly. I was like,

2236
02:06:17,971 --> 02:06:19,230
looking at this then I'm like,
man,

2237
02:06:19,590 --> 02:06:21,540
I think I've been doing my show
for nine years. I was like that.

2238
02:06:21,541 --> 02:06:24,030
I would actually have
something to show for it.

2239
02:06:24,270 --> 02:06:28,070
You guys are smarter than I am as a,
you know,

2240
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:31,380
I do mine on the fly on my laptop,
like wherever I'm at.

2241
02:06:31,381 --> 02:06:34,110
Sometimes I've done it on the
airplane when I'm flying, you know,

2242
02:06:34,590 --> 02:06:38,370
just when I got to get it in by the end
of the week. So. Well this thing is just,

2243
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:42,620
I mean, we need other people here.
This is like a location to do it from,

2244
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:47,680
but fucking what a great location when
the fucking wolf and Predator and fucking

2245
02:06:47,791 --> 02:06:52,260
lava lamps and fucking antlers
at this place is insane.

2246
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:56,520
Well, we've turned it into this. We
first moved in here. It was the opposite.

2247
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:57,720
It was like a board room or something.

2248
02:06:57,940 --> 02:07:01,110
It was just a regular or even the
covers over the fluorescent lights.

2249
02:07:01,110 --> 02:07:05,070
I've never seen that shit before.
Oh, their space. Yeah. Yeah man.

2250
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:08,340
I mean it's the vibe in this room.
It's like I would never, if I were you,

2251
02:07:08,341 --> 02:07:10,710
I would just stay in
this room all the time.

2252
02:07:10,950 --> 02:07:15,060
Just narrowing the pool table
outside of that. It's a good spot.

2253
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:17,720
Great Spot, man. Yeah, I, uh,

2254
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:22,630
I think it's important to have a space
where you feel comfortable. You know,

2255
02:07:22,631 --> 02:07:26,070
you feel like you could just chill out.
It doesn't feel corporate.

2256
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:30,270
I think it enhances the conversations and
a lot of ways for sure, man. You know,

2257
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:33,810
and also it just,
it's a creepy secret spot.

2258
02:07:34,050 --> 02:07:37,840
It feels like a creepy spot. It's
great man. It's great. I love it.

2259
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:42,130
So you think that you doing your radio
show and being honest about all these

2260
02:07:42,131 --> 02:07:44,500
things that held you back?
Yeah, I dunno. I mean,

2261
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:49,250
I do know like one time I said that
thing about, about the billboard and I,

2262
02:07:49,310 --> 02:07:52,210
I had evidence of this and I'm not gonna
say what artist it was cause I'm not in

2263
02:07:52,211 --> 02:07:55,150
the business to doing that.
But there was this big name artists,

2264
02:07:55,151 --> 02:07:57,040
we had this new record
coming out in his sponsor.

2265
02:07:57,041 --> 02:07:59,800
Companies bought 300,000
copies of it first week.

2266
02:07:59,801 --> 02:08:01,480
So they would make sure
that it went number one.

2267
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:06,850
And I said that on the radio and, and my
boss says any, they've teased, told me,

2268
02:08:06,851 --> 02:08:09,900
I've gotten a lot of calls that they'd
call him and they say he's saying this

2269
02:08:09,901 --> 02:08:13,030
shit and it's irresponsible because it's
not true. And I'm like, yes it is true.

2270
02:08:13,031 --> 02:08:15,220
I know it's true.
I've seen the paper that said it was true,

2271
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:18,370
but I mean I think they'd get
pissed that I said, but I,

2272
02:08:18,371 --> 02:08:19,570
a lot of people don't like me.

2273
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:22,420
They blackballed me a long time ago
anyway because I was just always,

2274
02:08:22,450 --> 02:08:23,650
I've always been that way,
man.

2275
02:08:23,651 --> 02:08:27,520
I'm at to my disadvantage a lot of ways.

2276
02:08:27,521 --> 02:08:32,380
But like if someone's a phony, I hate
that more than anything in the world, man.

2277
02:08:32,410 --> 02:08:33,041
And you know,

2278
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:36,930
there've been times in my life when I was
a phony growing up they girls and with

2279
02:08:36,931 --> 02:08:40,480
things like, you know, we
tried to try to get into that.

2280
02:08:40,481 --> 02:08:42,730
But as you get older and as
I've gotten older, it's just,

2281
02:08:43,210 --> 02:08:45,070
there's so much insincerity in,

2282
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:47,980
especially in the music business
that I have such a disdain for it.

2283
02:08:47,981 --> 02:08:51,500
It's just like,
like the way that the writers were.

2284
02:08:51,501 --> 02:08:55,930
Cause I mean what's happened to country
music is, is directly responsible.

2285
02:08:56,110 --> 02:08:58,480
I mean directly related
to like the exact same,

2286
02:08:58,510 --> 02:09:00,310
you know what we're talking
about corporate America,

2287
02:09:00,311 --> 02:09:01,870
it's like the same kind of shit.
It's just,

2288
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:05,680
it's just gotten to where
these corporations are in
so much power and they have

2289
02:09:05,681 --> 02:09:09,100
so much money that it's really hard for
like the little man to beat it, you know?

2290
02:09:09,101 --> 02:09:11,260
And so I just get really,

2291
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:16,490
I see people who pretend to be
for the little man and, or they,

2292
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:19,720
but yet they're playing this
fucking ballgame over here.

2293
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:22,630
And it like to talking out of both sides
of her mouth. And it just kills me,

2294
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:26,140
you know what I mean? So I'm the halt.
Say It, I'll happily say it all day long,

2295
02:09:26,141 --> 02:09:30,890
you know, but uh, but yeah,
like I definitely think that it,

2296
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:35,140
there, there are groups I just found
out about a group in Nashville,

2297
02:09:35,141 --> 02:09:35,974
but there are groups,

2298
02:09:36,010 --> 02:09:41,010
much like the Bilderberg group where they
are in music and in movies and things.

2299
02:09:41,261 --> 02:09:44,210
I mean, I know that everybody knows they
kind of had that kind of thing, but,

2300
02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:46,330
but there are actual groups where they,

2301
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:50,470
where they orchestrate kind
of who they're going to,

2302
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:53,230
who they're going to lend their
support too. I mean, they,

2303
02:09:53,231 --> 02:09:55,870
they never played me on the radio thought
like that are going to have a meeting

2304
02:09:55,871 --> 02:09:58,060
and they'll say, we're not wearing
it. I purposely keep shooter out.

2305
02:09:58,060 --> 02:10:01,920
It's not like that. Not that
paranoid, but, uh, but I, I'm,

2306
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,640
I do know that they have meetings about,
uh,

2307
02:10:04,810 --> 02:10:09,490
where the studio heads and the local
community and the congress and city

2308
02:10:09,491 --> 02:10:14,050
planners and developers and certain
record labels, mostly independent.

2309
02:10:14,090 --> 02:10:18,040
The independence of kind of choke, hold
it out. The corporate ones a little bit.

2310
02:10:18,041 --> 02:10:20,770
They've in a weird way,
especially in in Nashville,

2311
02:10:20,771 --> 02:10:25,720
but in the songwriters and the radio
people and they have these retreats that

2312
02:10:25,721 --> 02:10:28,720
they go on together and it's like,
Duh.

2313
02:10:28,750 --> 02:10:31,020
Like of course they're all
scratching each other's backs.

2314
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:32,920
And then of course like the little guy,

2315
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:36,890
they have to pay like 15 grand to join
this group to go on these retreats,

2316
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:40,670
you know, and keep paying.
And it's like, like, uh,

2317
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:43,870
it's fascinating to me.
You know, like when people,

2318
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:45,980
like that's the dumbest thing I've
ever heard. That doesn't happen.

2319
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:48,440
It's like if you think that
doesn't happen, then you are dumb.

2320
02:10:48,441 --> 02:10:51,980
Because of course these people want,
they want the keep their job,

2321
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:54,740
they want to stay in there, they want
to keep making the money they're making.

2322
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:59,840
So they'll do anything it takes to keep
that position. Yeah. It's unfortunate,

2323
02:10:59,841 --> 02:11:03,740
right? The people that are
in that sort of a position,

2324
02:11:03,741 --> 02:11:06,080
they're making a shitload of
money don't realize like, man,

2325
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:09,900
this is kind of bad for the
art form itself to do this.

2326
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:13,600
Like the very art form that we
need. Sellen. Yeah, they wouldn't.

2327
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:17,220
It's the short term victory that
they want and it's like the longterm,

2328
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:21,640
like people like us, you know, like I'm
a movie Fan, like I'm a blade runners,

2329
02:11:21,650 --> 02:11:26,270
my favorite movie of all time, but I raise
the, Oh man, I watched it the other day.

2330
02:11:26,770 --> 02:11:30,290
Watch. How many times have you
watched it? I mean hundreds at least.

2331
02:11:30,291 --> 02:11:32,540
I mean I just bought all these prints,
these posters.

2332
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:35,780
Is that all fulfill Philip k
Dick Novel? Yes. Yeah, I do.

2333
02:11:35,781 --> 02:11:38,990
Androids dream of electric
sheep is if the book,

2334
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:40,940
what a great fucking moving man,

2335
02:11:40,970 --> 02:11:44,570
great movie and stands up stands
up at the end of the movie.

2336
02:11:44,571 --> 02:11:46,270
The original version was Harrison Ford.

2337
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:50,030
Ford supposed to find out that he's
a robot to, well that's the kind of,

2338
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:53,000
that's kind of the point of the
divide. It's like the, the kind of,

2339
02:11:53,001 --> 02:11:57,290
the point of the movie a little bit is,
is that, I mean it's implied in that,

2340
02:11:57,291 --> 02:12:00,920
especially when at the very end of the
movie, Edward James Almost as character,

2341
02:12:00,921 --> 02:12:03,500
like he's been leaving these
origami all over the place,

2342
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:06,500
but he leaves the Unicorn.
But see in the original one,

2343
02:12:06,501 --> 02:12:09,620
I just watched the theatrical one for
the first time. I had never seen it.

2344
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:13,790
The one where, um, Harrison Ford
narrates the film. Oh that's the,

2345
02:12:14,050 --> 02:12:17,240
the original director's cut. No, the
director's cut is when he does not.

2346
02:12:17,241 --> 02:12:20,780
They took his voice off and then they
took the last scene out of the movie where

2347
02:12:20,781 --> 02:12:24,590
they drive away. That's the only
one you've seen the one till now.

2348
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:27,800
Which one's the director's cut. Yeah.
Cause that's the only one you can buy.

2349
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:31,400
They would, they would, the minute it was
available on DVD, I don't know about VHS,

2350
02:12:31,401 --> 02:12:35,300
but like the minute the DVDs came out,
the director's cut saturated the market.

2351
02:12:35,301 --> 02:12:37,580
So like I on, um, Voodoo, I bought it.

2352
02:12:37,610 --> 02:12:41,630
I was like trying to figure out a way
when I was traveling on the road and a car

2353
02:12:41,631 --> 02:12:44,570
and to venue to venue,
I was trying to figure out a way to,

2354
02:12:44,780 --> 02:12:47,900
I don't have enough space on my fucking
iPhone cause the fucking iCloud and the

2355
02:12:47,901 --> 02:12:50,000
pictures and all this
shit and it's always full.

2356
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,270
And I don't want to throw it against
the fucking wall, you know. But I, uh,

2357
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:55,910
the Voodoo app lets me watch
movies. So I was like, oh,

2358
02:12:55,911 --> 02:12:58,150
I'm going to watch blade runner.
And then I pulled it up and it was that,

2359
02:12:58,180 --> 02:13:00,780
that version,
which I had never seen there.

2360
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:05,240
Then there was a final cut that was
made about seven or eight years ago.

2361
02:13:05,241 --> 02:13:10,241
They came out and that one has
the deleted Unicorn scene in it.

2362
02:13:10,251 --> 02:13:15,200
And what, what, what that
is, is that I guess that,

2363
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:19,790
that uh, Harrison Ford's
character has some kind of a,

2364
02:13:19,791 --> 02:13:23,450
like there's a unicorn thing
in his past and his memory,

2365
02:13:23,451 --> 02:13:26,570
he has a memory of a Unicorn and
there's this scene where in the movie,

2366
02:13:26,571 --> 02:13:30,680
in the final cut where he shoots that
chick that had the snake around her neck

2367
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:32,040
when he shoots her,

2368
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,710
there's this shot of this Unicorn because
it reminded him of this thing and it

2369
02:13:35,711 --> 02:13:39,210
is kind of like connecting the dots that
he has this weird memory of a unicorn

2370
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:42,840
in the woods.
And at the very end of the film,

2371
02:13:42,841 --> 02:13:44,820
Edward James Almost makes a unicorn.

2372
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:48,570
He walks out the front door of his house
and there's a unicorn out of origami

2373
02:13:48,571 --> 02:13:51,960
sitting in there. And that's like Edward
James almost saying, hey, you know, we,

2374
02:13:52,130 --> 02:13:55,440
you're actually one too.
So that was kind of the implied,

2375
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:59,090
but the whole thing is like, you know,
if she's one, if he's wanting, you know,

2376
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:01,680
anyone could be one. And that
was the kind of, you know,

2377
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:06,720
I robot or we all robots. Like, you know,
that's kind of the, the ultimate story,

2378
02:14:06,721 --> 02:14:09,270
but it never confirms that.
But in the, in the book,

2379
02:14:09,271 --> 02:14:13,800
they run away together and she ends up
dying and it's like a love story. And,

2380
02:14:13,860 --> 02:14:17,880
and he, he, it, it ends up not mattering
if he has one or not. Because you know,

2381
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:20,860
well, in the real world
that we live in right now,

2382
02:14:20,890 --> 02:14:24,880
that seems like much more likely and
possibility than it ever did when blade

2383
02:14:24,881 --> 02:14:27,580
runner came out. Yeah,
man. Like back then,

2384
02:14:27,581 --> 02:14:31,270
like the idea of a robot that
looks exactly like a person,
like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2385
02:14:31,271 --> 02:14:34,660
Might as well be traveling to the moon.
Might as well be fucking, you know,

2386
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:38,740
Battlestar Galactica or something
like Xenu. Yeah. But now you,

2387
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:43,570
when you see the artificial bodies
that they're able to create now,

2388
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:47,800
like these robot faces that move and
articulate just like a human face,

2389
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:50,260
like really similar though.
Some of those Japanese ones,

2390
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:53,980
they're so similar and you just imagine
what's a hundred years from now I'm

2391
02:14:53,981 --> 02:14:55,420
going to be like, and like, it's uh,

2392
02:14:55,490 --> 02:15:00,410
the company that Hologram the company
that made the Tupac Hologram and then they

2393
02:15:00,411 --> 02:15:00,740
reached

2394
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:04,790
out to me and I met the guy yesterday.
It's got Gary and that he, I'm, I'm,

2395
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:05,900
I may be going there,

2396
02:15:05,930 --> 02:15:09,530
I have to go get my kids from here and I
made to be taking them to this guy. He,

2397
02:15:09,531 --> 02:15:12,940
cause he's contacted me about
wanting to do like a Whalen holiday.

2398
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:16,370
Like I think that they're trying to talk
about getting a bunch of the guys and

2399
02:15:16,371 --> 02:15:21,140
making a Hologram of like cash and La,
who knows.

2400
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:24,540
But like he wants to give
me the demonstration, but
I was talking to him about,

2401
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:26,270
and he said, man, you know the shit on TV.

2402
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:29,870
Like when it's not lit a certain way.

2403
02:15:30,190 --> 02:15:32,530
Like he didn't like the lighting
on the Michael Jackson one.

2404
02:15:32,540 --> 02:15:33,470
He said it wasn't right,

2405
02:15:33,471 --> 02:15:37,610
but he said that when they
do it correctly that that,

2406
02:15:38,810 --> 02:15:41,090
see,
it's like with Michael Jackson,

2407
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:46,120
they have a body double and then they
had this face technology that like that

2408
02:15:46,580 --> 02:15:51,380
does the face on top of someone
else's face. So it, it looks like,

2409
02:15:51,381 --> 02:15:55,430
right. But like you don't really have
to do that. Like it's not CGI people.

2410
02:15:55,640 --> 02:16:00,440
So they have the ability right now they
have the ability to do the help me,

2411
02:16:00,441 --> 02:16:03,470
Obi wan like I can,
they can,

2412
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:06,500
they have one thing that's got these
three d cameras and I can be in that room.

2413
02:16:07,170 --> 02:16:12,170
He was telling me a story about an
Indian guy in India who's running for

2414
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:17,390
president or whatever their fucking thing
is over there and that, that he, he,

2415
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:22,400
he told people he was really rich and
he had like 3% of the vote and he set up

2416
02:16:22,401 --> 02:16:22,621
these,

2417
02:16:22,621 --> 02:16:26,090
the hologram things and like every town
and he paid for them to all be over

2418
02:16:26,091 --> 02:16:28,370
there and said like, hey,
come see me. I'm going to,

2419
02:16:28,371 --> 02:16:33,220
I'm going to talk your town and he and
he likes stood at home in this thing and

2420
02:16:33,221 --> 02:16:36,670
he appeared in like 50 towns and they
didn't even know it was a hologram.

2421
02:16:36,990 --> 02:16:39,550
He thought he was really there and he
never told them so they thought he really

2422
02:16:39,551 --> 02:16:42,220
came to their fucking shit
town and there's nothing to do.

2423
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:45,400
Like you know they're little village
and it was like this guy and like he's a

2424
02:16:45,401 --> 02:16:49,390
right now like I could go over there and
they can have like a hologram thing set

2425
02:16:49,391 --> 02:16:52,090
up in Japan and I could like literally
walk in front of the cameras and I'd be

2426
02:16:52,091 --> 02:16:57,091
in Japan and I'd be talking
to motherfuckers and
totally like help me Obi wan

2427
02:16:57,131 --> 02:17:00,280
and say we all we want or like the fucking
sit lord guy appearing like talking

2428
02:17:00,281 --> 02:17:03,010
about it.
But it doesn't even look like that.

2429
02:17:03,011 --> 02:17:06,670
He said when it's in a normal room it
looks like you can't tell the difference

2430
02:17:07,090 --> 02:17:07,830
from a Hologram.

2431
02:17:07,830 --> 02:17:11,530
I will report to you on this after
I go to it if after I go see this

2432
02:17:11,531 --> 02:17:12,200
demonstration.
Yeah.

2433
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:16,970
Do you remember when they had that on
television for CNN when they were covering

2434
02:17:16,971 --> 02:17:21,230
the news and Wolf Blitzer would like
stand the CNN hologram. The holodeck?

2435
02:17:21,710 --> 02:17:25,280
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They uh,

2436
02:17:25,281 --> 02:17:29,450
they experimented with it during
elections. You got a video of a Jamie,

2437
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:34,310
he's got a good guy. Let's see
the Indian guy. Oh, you found it?

2438
02:17:34,460 --> 02:17:37,130
Yeah,
that sounds

2439
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:43,760
long. It's like 45 minutes. So
that dude right there as a hologram

2440
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:51,320
so he's not really there. I got
it. It got so hot in the last, wow.

2441
02:17:51,650 --> 02:17:55,620
How's, he appeared dope. If he fucking
appeared out of smoke coming out of that.

2442
02:17:55,820 --> 02:17:57,050
They're saying and demonstration.

2443
02:17:57,100 --> 02:18:01,210
They gave that guy, he was like,
I don't like presenting an award.

2444
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:05,830
And he was standing in the room and this
whole family walked in the room and uh,

2445
02:18:06,370 --> 02:18:09,250
and he was standing there and he talked
to them and they were like talking to

2446
02:18:09,251 --> 02:18:12,490
him back and everything and then he just
busted into flames and they were like

2447
02:18:12,491 --> 02:18:15,130
all freaked out because they
thought he was real. Look at it.

2448
02:18:15,170 --> 02:18:19,160
This looking at weed comes
in, first of all, how strange.

2449
02:18:19,161 --> 02:18:23,000
Let them walk in and get Jamie back it
up a little again because that guy's got

2450
02:18:23,001 --> 02:18:25,950
the fakest hand wave ever.
I would never vote for that motherfucker.

2451
02:18:26,060 --> 02:18:30,220
Just by the way, maybe this is like
an Indian thing, but I understand.

2452
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:33,710
We'll look at it. They're
introducing homeboy. Look,

2453
02:18:37,730 --> 02:18:39,950
first of all, he's wearing a
dress. What's that all about?

2454
02:18:40,340 --> 02:18:42,830
Are you a school teacher?
Your Old Lady school teacher.

2455
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:49,780
He's got a theme song to look.
Yeah.

2456
02:18:55,070 --> 02:18:57,560
That's hilarious.
Just fucking waving his hands.

2457
02:18:57,860 --> 02:19:01,850
He's wearing white tights and address.
This guy's a freak.

2458
02:19:02,930 --> 02:19:03,770
He's a Hologram.

2459
02:19:03,771 --> 02:19:07,010
He's wearing white tights and addressing
is going to sit down in a chair.

2460
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:13,580
White tights. So bizarre.
Man. That's so bizarre.

2461
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:17,700
It man, isn't it? Isn't it crazy? I mean
the technology that you can, that pot,

2462
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:21,910
the fact that you can do that.
It's just like, it's so amazing.

2463
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:25,070
Like I would love to not have to
ever do a show like travel to do.

2464
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:28,130
Should I just stand in my fucking
people want you to be there

2465
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:31,490
though. They want you to be there
physically. They didn't know. Yeah,

2466
02:19:31,491 --> 02:19:36,140
but isn't it something about actually
no one that's the guy there? Yeah,

2467
02:19:36,141 --> 02:19:39,710
of course. It's like, did you ever
hear that band man or astro man? No

2468
02:19:40,230 --> 02:19:44,850
band. Like in the like early two
thousands late nineties but they'd had,

2469
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:48,900
they had cloned bands, they had
wore masks, they wear these hoods.

2470
02:19:49,230 --> 02:19:52,410
So they had like five clone bands and
they'd send them out on the road and you

2471
02:19:52,411 --> 02:19:55,170
would never know if it was the real
band or not because they always had the

2472
02:19:55,171 --> 02:19:57,540
hoods on and shit, but they would
have like five different bands.

2473
02:19:57,541 --> 02:20:00,980
They would just send up
touring. Oh, that's silly. Yeah.

2474
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:02,450
You know people didn't know it.

2475
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:07,010
I know, but isn't that like half
the thing if the pay to see,

2476
02:20:07,011 --> 02:20:10,150
do you want the guy to be right
there? You know, like yeah,

2477
02:20:10,170 --> 02:20:13,750
your reputation will be really damaged
if they found that you were actually in

2478
02:20:13,751 --> 02:20:14,870
your living room and the shit

2479
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:20,890
it like started fucking up while
you're doing it, man. That'd be,

2480
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:23,860
that would be righteous though. If I was
watching fucking, I'm like, you know,

2481
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:29,100
nails, CNN, the CNN thing that they
did during the wolf blitzer. Yeah.

2482
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:33,130
They only did it during the elections.
And it's like, everybody's like, Ooh,

2483
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:37,990
they're busting out the fucking hologram.
This is crazy. Wow. And he wouldn't,

2484
02:20:38,170 --> 02:20:42,610
you know, be in another location and
they, you know, they would appear,

2485
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:46,520
started it with a will.
I am the guy from the black eyed peas.

2486
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:49,550
They started with him and
then they used it with him.

2487
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:53,480
They use it. It was it an
Obama event. It wasn't it.

2488
02:20:53,481 --> 02:20:56,060
A John will know and pull out the,

2489
02:20:56,110 --> 02:20:58,790
see the CNN reporters did it

2490
02:20:59,610 --> 02:21:03,350
see like there is a beautiful time
in Los Angeles. My mom texted me,

2491
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:07,550
telling me how proud she is of me and
pull it back so you could see him appear.

2492
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:11,840
That's fascinating. You a brand
new day and applied in Grand Park.

2493
02:21:11,841 --> 02:21:15,260
Let's see if he came
me and now here we go.

2494
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:20,930
Let's make it look as much like star
trek is, we can be appearing process. Oh,

2495
02:21:20,931 --> 02:21:25,070
this is great. You know, we're at an
eve of a, a brand new day in America.

2496
02:21:25,130 --> 02:21:28,600
How weird is that being here in Chicago?
Uh,

2497
02:21:30,510 --> 02:21:34,480
former and Obama supporters
basically like exactly like in a,

2498
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:36,340
in star trek when they
would be and people down.

2499
02:21:36,341 --> 02:21:40,120
That's what it looks like right here.
Yeah. But yeah, but this is, it's a,

2500
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:44,460
it's a beautiful time here.
Um, in Chicago. It's a
beautiful time in Los Angeles.

2501
02:21:44,461 --> 02:21:45,110
My mom,

2502
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:48,920
the purpose of this just to show
up, show up the technology, well,

2503
02:21:48,921 --> 02:21:50,660
to just didn't add an element.

2504
02:21:50,870 --> 02:21:55,250
They did it with Wolf Blitzer and
remember he was a, he was a hologram too.

2505
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:58,640
Isn't it funny though to listen to
that guy? It's a beautiful time.

2506
02:21:58,641 --> 02:22:01,970
Everything's amazing. Cut to
everybody. Fucking hates him.

2507
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:07,000
Six years later you fucking piece of shit.
All of you.

2508
02:22:07,001 --> 02:22:10,460
You fuck heads even will I am right.
Didn't you like run for a,

2509
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:13,880
he was going to be the president of
Haiti or some shit like that? No, no.

2510
02:22:14,670 --> 02:22:18,290
That was the other guy. The
guy from a will. I am with,

2511
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:23,850
what's his name? Wyclef Sean.
The same guy to me. Yeah, it's,

2512
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:26,190
I was about to make that joke when he said

2513
02:22:26,290 --> 02:22:30,060
that about it being like my John and then
he said it. Yeah, there was this broad,

2514
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:34,800
we're going to be
another one.

2515
02:22:35,750 --> 02:22:38,930
She's some chicken where I am was
paying like 20 minutes before.

2516
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:42,260
Did you hear the, did you, you're the guy,

2517
02:22:42,261 --> 02:22:47,040
do you know all the controversy about
the dude who bubba buoyed or no, no,

2518
02:22:47,130 --> 02:22:51,480
no, he didn't [inaudible] he
quit the MSN BC thing recently.

2519
02:22:51,481 --> 02:22:54,420
The Howard stern thing.
No, what happened? MSNBC.

2520
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:58,500
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's this guy, there was a guy who, uh,

2521
02:22:58,530 --> 02:23:00,660
I kept trying to remember
his whack pack name on there,

2522
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:05,190
but like he had gone into retirement
from doing prank calls. Well,

2523
02:23:05,191 --> 02:23:08,010
one day recently on,

2524
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:12,750
they were talking about the Malaysia air
thing and this guy calls in and they're

2525
02:23:12,751 --> 02:23:16,950
like, we've got this soldier from the
war on the phone. And he goes, yes,

2526
02:23:16,951 --> 02:23:19,320
I believe I saw something.
I, you know, I saw it.

2527
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:21,030
I was driving and I
looked out of my passion,

2528
02:23:21,031 --> 02:23:25,290
which I saw something I believe it was a
giant burst of wind from Howard Stern's

2529
02:23:25,291 --> 02:23:29,910
ass that hit Malaysia plane and all of a
sudden like the lady's like, excuse me.

2530
02:23:30,030 --> 02:23:34,100
She's like, so can you tell me what you
like? She starts to it and he goes, well,

2531
02:23:34,110 --> 02:23:36,390
you're fucking dumb,
aren't you the girl?

2532
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:38,750
And they like cut the transmission
and there was like he,

2533
02:23:38,751 --> 02:23:41,520
and he turns out he wrote an email
to Howard Stern, his people. He said,

2534
02:23:41,521 --> 02:23:44,590
this is how I got in there. He said,
he called and he said that he was a,

2535
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:48,750
he was a soldier in the air force or
something and they put him on the phone

2536
02:23:48,751 --> 02:23:53,680
with a guy, another guy who then
like it was trying to quiz him on,

2537
02:23:53,970 --> 02:23:58,260
on him being legit. Totally
said he bullshitted his
way all the way through it.

2538
02:23:58,410 --> 02:24:02,520
The guy let him through, they let
him on fucking MSNBC in this moment.

2539
02:24:02,521 --> 02:24:04,560
And this chick,
her name was crystal ball,

2540
02:24:04,561 --> 02:24:08,010
was the name of the check as I can
reason why I can remember it that.

2541
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:12,720
And she was just like, you know, I
had no idea what to do with that.

2542
02:24:12,721 --> 02:24:15,270
When the guy said fucking high
burst of wind from Harrison,

2543
02:24:15,310 --> 02:24:19,680
his ass is what hit it. Like, you know
Msnbc like is that all this trouble?

2544
02:24:19,681 --> 02:24:24,681
Cause like no one was paying attention
while it went down for so long for a

2545
02:24:24,990 --> 02:24:26,670
couple of minutes. And then they
cut it and it was like, man,

2546
02:24:26,671 --> 02:24:31,140
everyone got fired because it was like,
I mean they, not only did he get through,

2547
02:24:31,141 --> 02:24:35,130
but they didn't even catch that. He said,
Howard Stern's asked for a long time.

2548
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:37,650
When you're doing those
things and those remotes,

2549
02:24:37,651 --> 02:24:40,530
you have an ear piece in and a lot of
times it's hard to understand what the

2550
02:24:40,531 --> 02:24:41,610
fuck anybody saying.

2551
02:24:41,611 --> 02:24:44,300
And there's a bit of a delay and
them saying it and you hearing

2552
02:24:44,490 --> 02:24:46,980
crystal ball, I can, I
can, I can forgive her.

2553
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:51,240
But the guy sitting over there watching
the fucking broadcast or supposedly

2554
02:24:51,241 --> 02:24:55,020
watching the broadcast when it goes down
and in editing on the fly and all that,

2555
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:59,450
that guy should have been
like, uh, cut it. You know,

2556
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:03,690
cut it now. But I don't remember
the some ting long when the,

2557
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:06,690
when the plane crashed. Oh
yeah. That was another one.

2558
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:10,850
Four different names and they all got
fired cause some editor fucked up and yes

2559
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:13,400
it is something Wong.
Did she think that? Yeah,

2560
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:18,440
there was something recently the,
the New York Daily News.

2561
02:25:18,441 --> 02:25:22,280
Let some fake story go through and uh,

2562
02:25:22,310 --> 02:25:23,980
didn't do any checking.
It

2563
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:27,910
was all over the news.
I forget what New York Daily News.

2564
02:25:27,911 --> 02:25:32,170
Hoaxed daily.
That's funny man.

2565
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:36,640
They all are, it happens all the
time. People were trying so hard,

2566
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:40,180
you know,
it's with fake news comes through.

2567
02:25:40,181 --> 02:25:43,210
That's like the most real
thing we're getting. Yeah.

2568
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:47,200
Well you know we live in strange times
where anybody can get information out.

2569
02:25:47,740 --> 02:25:52,390
You can. But especially with these
legacy media, places like that,

2570
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:54,320
like, like news, like we're,

2571
02:25:54,321 --> 02:25:58,150
we're getting someone who's live on the
scene and like that's like those are

2572
02:25:58,151 --> 02:26:01,060
targets for people fucking
with people. Yeah. It's like,

2573
02:26:01,061 --> 02:26:02,770
cause you know that
everyone's looking at this,

2574
02:26:02,771 --> 02:26:05,830
everyone's paying attention to this. If
you can get on there and Baba booey yet.

2575
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:08,530
He'll definitely get like
some play on the radio show.

2576
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:13,000
People will do things like that.
I don't know. Gosh, turns pain is,

2577
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:17,590
yeah, it's uh, we're, we're in
weird times when it comes to that.

2578
02:26:18,010 --> 02:26:21,070
We're also weird times when it comes
to those things being relevant at all

2579
02:26:21,071 --> 02:26:24,010
because at a certain point
in time you've got people,

2580
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:27,580
they're realizing that more people are
paying attention to online sources than

2581
02:26:27,581 --> 02:26:31,270
they are. Yeah. Facebook,
Twitter, all of the above.

2582
02:26:31,271 --> 02:26:35,710
There's so many different things. The
nightly news, like who, I mean I'll watch,

2583
02:26:35,711 --> 02:26:37,510
I do, I will say like if, if I,

2584
02:26:37,570 --> 02:26:41,110
if I'm cruising the channels and I'm home
and like the five, six o'clock news on,

2585
02:26:41,260 --> 02:26:44,160
I'll turn it on because
I cause it locally de la,

2586
02:26:44,161 --> 02:26:46,660
like if there's anything going on
I'll kind of be interested in that.

2587
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:50,870
But otherwise like who watches the
news on like Channel Two? Yeah,

2588
02:26:50,980 --> 02:26:52,630
I mean who are just fucking scene.

2589
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:55,900
The only reason why they watch
CNN is because of, you know,

2590
02:26:55,901 --> 02:26:58,510
it'll be something massive has happened
and people want to tune in and like

2591
02:26:58,540 --> 02:27:03,220
watch it 24 seven otherwise it's like
you don't really, it's going away.

2592
02:27:03,490 --> 02:27:06,580
It's going away slowly but surely.
And also the format is so bizarre.

2593
02:27:06,581 --> 02:27:10,240
The like the, the evening news,
like the Los Angeles Evening News,

2594
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:13,210
those are the fakeness
broadcast in the world.

2595
02:27:13,211 --> 02:27:17,920
The way that everyone talks is fake. You
don't get, you don't see any personality,

2596
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:20,350
you don't have any connection
to those people. You know,

2597
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:23,490
if you had someone like shooter
Jennings reads the news, like Dan,

2598
02:27:23,491 --> 02:27:26,230
this some shit went down
today, you know, and you start,

2599
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:29,290
people would connect to
that in a way like, oh,

2600
02:27:29,291 --> 02:27:32,500
this is a real guy and he's
telling me about some real stuff.

2601
02:27:32,530 --> 02:27:36,940
But if you watch the average broadcast,
it's on the local news show.

2602
02:27:37,090 --> 02:27:42,040
There's so it's so fake and, yeah,
and so like uptight and, and weird.

2603
02:27:42,041 --> 02:27:46,600
Yeah. And it's just the same garbage
duct to you. Like it's not updated.

2604
02:27:46,601 --> 02:27:48,940
That's why people like,
you know, I don't like,

2605
02:27:48,941 --> 02:27:51,640
I look at my Twitter feed for that.

2606
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:54,730
Like if I hear something's
going on or if I like, you know,

2607
02:27:54,760 --> 02:27:55,720
if I see something like,

2608
02:27:55,721 --> 02:28:00,721
it's like the culmination
of all the people I follow
kind of provide the correct

2609
02:28:00,821 --> 02:28:04,770
information. Do you know what I mean?
That seems more effective to me. Yeah.

2610
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:08,650
And even then you still have to process
stuff. There's so much bullshit.

2611
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:12,550
It's so difficult to figure out
what's right, what's wrong and,

2612
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:16,210
and then when you have this information
thrown into the mix, I mean,

2613
02:28:16,510 --> 02:28:19,300
it's been proven that
government organizations will,

2614
02:28:19,301 --> 02:28:22,160
when there's something bad goes down,
they'll throw a bunch

2615
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:26,480
of wacky shit into the news as
well to sort of counter balance.

2616
02:28:26,690 --> 02:28:30,230
Like there's a lot of people out there
that believe that a lot of the conspiracy

2617
02:28:30,231 --> 02:28:34,280
theorists that like say the most
ridiculous shit that they're,

2618
02:28:34,310 --> 02:28:39,310
they're being hired to say ridiculous
shit because it makes all conspiracies.

2619
02:28:39,530 --> 02:28:43,280
Conspiracies sound silly. Yeah.
Yeah, of course. I believe that 100%.

2620
02:28:43,330 --> 02:28:45,950
I believe that their misinformation
agents all over the place.

2621
02:28:46,410 --> 02:28:51,410
He Hall was one who only manly p hall
famous writer and wrote a lot of books

2622
02:28:51,861 --> 02:28:56,270
about a lot of conspiracy type thing and
he was a straight up a disinformation

2623
02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:00,320
agent for the masons.
Really? Yeah. He was like,

2624
02:29:00,321 --> 02:29:05,321
he was out there trying to cloud up
the religion side of things but for the

2625
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:08,050
Masons Bay via the conspiracy
where I'll mainly be all,

2626
02:29:08,051 --> 02:29:11,990
it's like famous and a lot of people swear
by his shit but he was really a mason

2627
02:29:11,991 --> 02:29:15,800
and he was like in bed with that. What
did they ever figure that William? Uh,

2628
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:19,400
what's the guy who wrote behold a pale
horse man and we could talk about this

2629
02:29:19,401 --> 02:29:23,190
guy a lot. Have you Cooper
Cooper man. I love his shit dude.

2630
02:29:23,350 --> 02:29:28,350
[inaudible] really nutty shit about
like alien bases on the moon and yeah.

2631
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:31,730
Yeah, he got into some shit like
that in there. But man, if you,

2632
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:35,420
did you ever listen to his radio show?
You can download every episode of it.

2633
02:29:35,450 --> 02:29:38,420
I've been trying,
I've been in contact with is a estate,

2634
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:42,650
because I'm trying to take the hour of
the time is the name of the show and

2635
02:29:42,651 --> 02:29:44,060
every, every single episode, you know,

2636
02:29:44,061 --> 02:29:47,260
he was killed in the 5th
of November in 2001, Waze,

2637
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:51,950
he was in the UFC fight or a gunfight.
He sat on the air,

2638
02:29:51,951 --> 02:29:53,170
he was like, look, because it,

2639
02:29:53,171 --> 02:29:57,720
Bill Clinton is labeled in
the most dangerous person
on a radio. And he said it,

2640
02:29:57,930 --> 02:30:00,020
he said, they're going to
come after me. And he goes,

2641
02:30:00,021 --> 02:30:02,990
and I bet you money that they're
going to use the IRS is the reason.

2642
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:05,170
And so they did.
They had it.

2643
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:09,170
So he moved his family away and then
they came after her for tax evasion and,

2644
02:30:09,171 --> 02:30:10,970
and when he wouldn't comply,

2645
02:30:10,971 --> 02:30:14,330
they sent the US
Marshall's in there and uh,

2646
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:18,740
and they shot at him and he shot one of
them and they killed him. Really? Yeah.

2647
02:30:18,741 --> 02:30:20,120
But he's, man, that story,

2648
02:30:20,121 --> 02:30:25,040
that dude is very fascinating because he
is the real life. Like, like, like dude,

2649
02:30:25,041 --> 02:30:27,170
I mean the,
in my than black ribbons where I could,

2650
02:30:27,171 --> 02:30:29,120
the Stephen King character gets
killed and everything in the end.

2651
02:30:29,121 --> 02:30:30,800
I mean he's the real
life character of that.

2652
02:30:30,801 --> 02:30:34,880
Like this guy was out there and his radio
show is awesome and he was just like

2653
02:30:34,881 --> 02:30:38,300
telling you, it's like the first person
talking about the Bilderberg group,

2654
02:30:38,301 --> 02:30:42,050
the first person talking about all these
people and just laying it out there no

2655
02:30:42,051 --> 02:30:44,150
matter what it,
who had pissed off.

2656
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:48,680
And eventually it pissed off enough people
to get him killed. But he, but he, uh,

2657
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:52,700
he's very fascinating and the hour of
the time I wanted to take the first

2658
02:30:52,701 --> 02:30:56,900
episode of it and print it on a 12
inch vinyl cause it's just long enough.

2659
02:30:56,901 --> 02:31:01,220
I wanted to put music under it and, and,
and, and make a record on a record label.

2660
02:31:01,221 --> 02:31:04,430
And I was trying to get the family to
let me do that, but they were interested.

2661
02:31:04,431 --> 02:31:05,750
But then they kind of disappeared on me.

2662
02:31:05,770 --> 02:31:09,620
But have you ever looked into
William Cooper debunked? I have.

2663
02:31:09,621 --> 02:31:11,900
I've looked into some of that
stuff, but I mean it, it,

2664
02:31:11,901 --> 02:31:14,480
it seemed to me William Cooper,

2665
02:31:14,481 --> 02:31:18,050
I mean obviously he was hitting
on some pretty harsh things if,

2666
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:19,980
if he was killed by the United States

2667
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:20,990
government.
I mean they didn't,

2668
02:31:21,350 --> 02:31:24,950
maybe he owed a lot of taxes and he got
in a shoot out with the federal marshals

2669
02:31:24,951 --> 02:31:28,400
who came to arrest him. Is
that possible too? Yeah,

2670
02:31:28,401 --> 02:31:32,330
but I bet if you got,
if you listened to his show,

2671
02:31:33,080 --> 02:31:37,930
he's very saying he's not, he doesn't,
he's, he seems, he's very collected.

2672
02:31:37,940 --> 02:31:41,010
He's very smart, very educated.
Like it'd be one thing.

2673
02:31:41,230 --> 02:31:43,420
It was like full of shit,

2674
02:31:43,990 --> 02:31:47,350
but he's not like his, if you
listen to his show, he's, he was,

2675
02:31:47,380 --> 02:31:49,540
he was very wise to things and he was,

2676
02:31:49,541 --> 02:31:52,180
and he was saying a lot of shit
that would piss a lot of people off.

2677
02:31:52,181 --> 02:31:53,530
And I know for a fact a lot of it,

2678
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:56,620
I read his book and halfway
in the book I was like, Bitch.

2679
02:31:56,650 --> 02:32:01,390
And I tossed it across the room. Yeah.
There was some wacky shit in there.

2680
02:32:01,910 --> 02:32:05,260
If you go to rational Wiki,
yeah. You got a rational wiki.

2681
02:32:05,530 --> 02:32:09,670
He believed that Ufo people
were controlling the world
that UFL technology had

2682
02:32:09,671 --> 02:32:12,550
been used in Vietnam. He became, uh,

2683
02:32:12,610 --> 02:32:16,480
one of the stars in the Ufo lecture
circuit writing books that alleged that

2684
02:32:16,481 --> 02:32:18,790
space aliens were part
of the new world order.

2685
02:32:19,210 --> 02:32:22,360
He later believed that he had been tricked
into believing in aliens and it was

2686
02:32:22,361 --> 02:32:23,920
all part of an Illuminati plot,

2687
02:32:23,921 --> 02:32:28,900
including the JFK assassination and
the fake moon landings. Uh, yeah,

2688
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:30,510
he,
you know about the Cooper

2689
02:32:30,590 --> 02:32:34,300
and landing thing. Right. What about
it, but about how the, there's a,

2690
02:32:34,301 --> 02:32:39,200
there's a theory that, that uh, that
the u s government wanted the, the,

2691
02:32:39,201 --> 02:32:41,910
the technology that he developed during
doctor strange love and he used it in

2692
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:45,940
2001 for the monkeys and
in the backgrounds and the
way he shot that stuff,

2693
02:32:46,370 --> 02:32:50,800
that they came to him to film the,
to fake the moon landings. Yeah.

2694
02:32:50,801 --> 02:32:54,760
I've heard that they would fund, they
would give him on unlimited access to the,

2695
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:58,990
to NASA and everything for 2001
and fund every film forever.

2696
02:32:59,290 --> 02:33:04,180
I said that supposedly like he was
hinting at a lot of it in 2001 and an eyes

2697
02:33:04,181 --> 02:33:04,780
wide shut,

2698
02:33:04,780 --> 02:33:08,650
especially in eyes wide shut that he was
hinting to like what he'd done in the

2699
02:33:08,651 --> 02:33:09,410
movie a lot.

2700
02:33:09,410 --> 02:33:11,760
Well there's documentaries
that show all the secrets,

2701
02:33:11,870 --> 02:33:14,000
symbolism that he put
him into the shining.

2702
02:33:14,001 --> 02:33:17,300
That movie's terrible because see
I had studied all that shit man.

2703
02:33:17,301 --> 02:33:21,260
And it's so true. There's such cool
shit in it. And that movie was like,

2704
02:33:21,590 --> 02:33:22,550
they were like review.

2705
02:33:22,580 --> 02:33:26,120
They were like interviewing the craziest
people on the planet earth with no

2706
02:33:26,121 --> 02:33:28,160
frame of reference to what
they were talking about.

2707
02:33:28,161 --> 02:33:30,800
And like when you watch that
movie it's like why didn't,

2708
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:31,970
it sounds like they're crazy.

2709
02:33:31,971 --> 02:33:34,790
It's not like everything about that movie
is bullshit because these people who

2710
02:33:34,791 --> 02:33:37,150
are talking are clearly insane and,

2711
02:33:37,250 --> 02:33:41,840
but the people who who like actually did
the research before those Kooks are the

2712
02:33:41,841 --> 02:33:45,110
people that it was kind of fascinating
about. But I'm big Kubrick nerd anyway,

2713
02:33:45,111 --> 02:33:48,260
so like Kubrick was definitely a
genius and definitely fascinating guy.

2714
02:33:48,261 --> 02:33:50,780
If anybody was capable of faking anything,

2715
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:53,780
which is a website reality sandwich.

2716
02:33:53,781 --> 02:33:58,580
There's an article I read that I
read the Atlantic. I'm not convinced,

2717
02:33:59,020 --> 02:34:02,780
I'm fascinated. I'm not convinced, you
know, I'm not convinced about any of it.

2718
02:34:02,781 --> 02:34:05,300
To me, honestly, I'm not convinced about
the Midland. I'm not convinced about this.

2719
02:34:05,301 --> 02:34:06,800
So it'd be not,
I don't know.

2720
02:34:06,830 --> 02:34:10,280
You ever heard Bill Clinton's taken the
moon landing? No. This is one of the best.

2721
02:34:10,281 --> 02:34:14,170
Bill Clinton wrote this book
called my life. And, uh,

2722
02:34:14,180 --> 02:34:18,370
in his book my life, he had
a whole quote about, um,

2723
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:23,710
about the moon here. I'll pull it
up. Oh, I know that my life book, uh,

2724
02:34:23,740 --> 02:34:24,630
this is,
uh,

2725
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:29,290
this is the quote he wrote in his quote
he wrote about when he was young, um,

2726
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:34,390
uh, and he had seen the moon landing. He
goes, this is a, I forget what page it is,

2727
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:37,270
or it's just says, just a
month before Apollo, uh,

2728
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:42,420
11 astronauts buzz Aldrin and Neil
Armstrong had left their colleague Michael

2729
02:34:42,730 --> 02:34:47,730
Collins above a board starship Colombia
and walked on the moon beating by five

2730
02:34:48,431 --> 02:34:48,791
months.

2731
02:34:48,791 --> 02:34:53,740
President Kennedy's goal of putting them
on a man on the moon before the end of

2732
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:58,660
the decade. Um, the old carpenter asked
me if I believe that it happened. I said,

2733
02:34:58,661 --> 02:35:01,600
sure. I saw it on
television. He disagreed.

2734
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:05,920
He said that he didn't believe it for a
minute and that them television fellers

2735
02:35:05,921 --> 02:35:10,921
in quote could make things look
real that weren't back then.

2736
02:35:10,991 --> 02:35:14,140
I thought he was a crank during
my eight years in Washington.

2737
02:35:14,141 --> 02:35:18,100
I saw some things on TV that made me
wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time.

2738
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:21,480
That's fucking crazy.

2739
02:35:21,810 --> 02:35:25,890
That's crazy that a president would say
that of the United States would say,

2740
02:35:27,030 --> 02:35:32,030
I saw some things on television during
my time in Washington that made me wonder

2741
02:35:32,101 --> 02:35:36,150
if he wasn't ahead of his
time specifically talking
about a guy claiming the

2742
02:35:36,151 --> 02:35:38,750
moon, that the moon landings
were fake. See, I could

2743
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:40,400
totally buy it too,

2744
02:35:40,430 --> 02:35:44,020
because of the fact that especially in
the in then and we're technology is,

2745
02:35:44,021 --> 02:35:47,960
I mean, look at us now, like we
haven't gone back and we're trying,

2746
02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:50,800
we've sent a rover to Mars,
but we have not yet.

2747
02:35:50,830 --> 02:35:54,790
The rovers are easy. Here's the real
thing is biological life in space.

2748
02:35:54,791 --> 02:35:57,700
That's the really difficult
thing because of the radiation,

2749
02:35:57,701 --> 02:36:02,560
because of the solar flares,
because of all sorts of micro meteors,

2750
02:36:02,561 --> 02:36:05,440
there's all sorts of things that can
happen to someone when they're outside.

2751
02:36:05,670 --> 02:36:07,600
Yeah. You know, you're,
you're out there in space.

2752
02:36:07,601 --> 02:36:11,080
You're not protected by the environment.
You're not protected by the atmosphere.

2753
02:36:11,081 --> 02:36:11,980
So there's no,

2754
02:36:12,190 --> 02:36:16,900
no protection from like micro meteors
asteroidal impacts like all the different

2755
02:36:16,901 --> 02:36:18,460
things like when you see shooting stars,

2756
02:36:18,461 --> 02:36:22,480
those are fucking rocks that were in
space then made their way down to earth.

2757
02:36:22,481 --> 02:36:26,590
But they get eaten up in the
atmosphere and they burn out. Yeah,

2758
02:36:26,591 --> 02:36:28,540
I mean the radiation is the big one.

2759
02:36:29,060 --> 02:36:29,893
Here's the thing,

2760
02:36:30,020 --> 02:36:32,750
I think that will Willard we're going to
know and I tell you when we're going to

2761
02:36:32,751 --> 02:36:37,590
know is, is these independent
contractors or trying to get to the moon,

2762
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:38,423
Google and being one of them.

2763
02:36:38,690 --> 02:36:42,500
When someone else asks someone else
besides the government goes to the moon,

2764
02:36:42,530 --> 02:36:45,680
I don't mean the Russian government and
the bread around the same time. Like,

2765
02:36:45,681 --> 02:36:46,151
if someone,

2766
02:36:46,151 --> 02:36:49,970
someone independent goes to the moon and
it looks way different than it did when

2767
02:36:49,971 --> 02:36:53,190
they did it in the 60s you know,
and it's like, oh, like really,

2768
02:36:53,191 --> 02:36:57,560
you don't float when we walk in here. You
know what I mean? Like then we'll know.

2769
02:36:57,590 --> 02:37:00,500
You know, there's, there's a lot of
fucking things about that. There's,

2770
02:37:00,910 --> 02:37:03,790
if you know on that one website with the
Kubrick thing and they're like, dude,

2771
02:37:03,791 --> 02:37:07,990
this contrast thing where it kind
of compares the 2001 monkey scenes.

2772
02:37:08,700 --> 02:37:12,240
Yeah. Well that was the word
comparing a style of filming, calling,

2773
02:37:12,241 --> 02:37:15,980
I think it was called front screen
projection. Yeah. Something along

2774
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,630
those lines.
That's exactly what it is.

2775
02:37:17,631 --> 02:37:21,140
That front screen rear screen or
whatever it is, it's he, he had a,

2776
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:26,180
it's like a two way mirror and there's
these certain kinds of beads and there's

2777
02:37:26,181 --> 02:37:29,780
the projection coming from a
different angle and is able to like,

2778
02:37:29,781 --> 02:37:33,220
you're able to film the actors on the
stage at the same time as the background.

2779
02:37:33,221 --> 02:37:35,270
Is that adding it later?
So that's why it looks real.

2780
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:37,420
Yeah. The Reality Sandwich, uh,

2781
02:37:37,810 --> 02:37:42,790
title is how Kubrick faked
the moon landing. Yeah. Uh,

2782
02:37:42,940 --> 02:37:45,880
you know, I think, I don't
know if this is this,

2783
02:37:45,910 --> 02:37:49,620
I believe in it wholeheartedly
for a long time. And, uh,

2784
02:37:49,630 --> 02:37:52,290
this reality sandwich article shows,
um,

2785
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:56,980
the use of this front screen projection
method and how it, it mimics,

2786
02:37:56,981 --> 02:37:57,940
I think that's what it's called,

2787
02:37:58,180 --> 02:38:01,720
how it mimics what the shots
looked like from the moon landings.

2788
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:05,380
The real issue with the moon
landing says how few, if you,

2789
02:38:05,470 --> 02:38:09,460
if you stop and think
about between 1969 in 1972,

2790
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:15,190
that's when all these took place and
that no one has been more than 400 miles

2791
02:38:15,191 --> 02:38:16,630
above the earth's surface since then.

2792
02:38:16,670 --> 02:38:19,620
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's
what I'm saying. That's what seems so,

2793
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:21,110
so ridiculous to me

2794
02:38:21,930 --> 02:38:25,280
knowing that. How about
when Neil Armstrong, he's a,

2795
02:38:25,310 --> 02:38:28,920
there's a 20th anniversary
of the moon landing, uh,

2796
02:38:28,940 --> 02:38:33,770
for NASA and uh, he, he gives a speech or
25th anniversary, I think it was. Yeah.

2797
02:38:33,830 --> 02:38:34,640
That's what it was.

2798
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:39,640
And he gives this speech at the
White House and his words were,

2799
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:41,360
there are great ideas,

2800
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:45,140
undiscovered breakthroughs available
to those who can remove one of truth

2801
02:38:45,141 --> 02:38:49,460
protective layers. That's, that's
the quote that he gives. He's,

2802
02:38:49,550 --> 02:38:53,810
he's speaking to America's
a honor students,

2803
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:54,770
like all the,
uh,

2804
02:38:54,771 --> 02:38:58,460
the high school students that get the
best grades and science and math and all

2805
02:38:58,461 --> 02:39:01,460
these different things and they're all
there listening to this guy was the first

2806
02:39:01,461 --> 02:39:05,120
man on the moon talk. And this is the
thing he says, there are great ideas,

2807
02:39:05,330 --> 02:39:08,540
undiscovered breakthroughs available
to those who can remove one,

2808
02:39:08,541 --> 02:39:10,810
a truth protective layers.
Yeah.

2809
02:39:10,850 --> 02:39:14,420
But the fuck does that mean like
that's between him and Clinton.

2810
02:39:14,421 --> 02:39:17,210
It's almost like if the
moon landings were real,

2811
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:22,070
like they're clearly fucking
with everybody begging for
people to read into it.

2812
02:39:22,190 --> 02:39:25,350
Yeah. But if it wasn't real,
it's almost like poetic how,

2813
02:39:25,370 --> 02:39:28,070
how they're dropping these truths.

2814
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:31,070
Yeah. That was how the, with Kubrick,
like they said that they didn't,

2815
02:39:31,071 --> 02:39:34,970
a lot of the films, like he was
dropping the guilt of the fact that he,

2816
02:39:34,971 --> 02:39:38,540
that he'd lied, that he did this
thing and that it's a, you know,

2817
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:43,130
that he was trying to,
trying to admit it and a lot of the films,

2818
02:39:43,220 --> 02:39:47,130
it is pretty crazy with the last
time people went, it was 1972 yeah.

2819
02:39:47,250 --> 02:39:51,050
Like fucking clothes since then.
And not only have we not come close,

2820
02:39:51,051 --> 02:39:54,170
we've never gone further than 400 miles.
That's,

2821
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:58,820
that's the thing about every single space
shuttle mission, every space station,

2822
02:39:58,821 --> 02:39:59,151
mission,

2823
02:39:59,151 --> 02:40:03,590
everything is inside of 400 miles from
the earth's surface except the Apollo

2824
02:40:03,591 --> 02:40:08,060
missions.
All those were 260,000 miles and back,

2825
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:13,740
you know, so it's hard to believe
it is hard to believe in. I mean,

2826
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:16,440
it's like you're like cad.
No one's ever gonna make it to the middle.

2827
02:40:16,441 --> 02:40:17,640
They're never going to prove it.
And we'll be,

2828
02:40:17,641 --> 02:40:20,700
I'll be dead by the time they do
anyway. So who cares? The big mind fuck

2829
02:40:20,720 --> 02:40:22,610
for me is when you look
at the moon itself,

2830
02:40:22,611 --> 02:40:25,280
like you're sitting at home and you look
up, you see the moon and you're like,

2831
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:27,710
bitch,
nobody went there.

2832
02:40:27,830 --> 02:40:32,540
Yeah. I feel like you did not
no way. Look at that shit.

2833
02:40:32,541 --> 02:40:36,410
That's bullshit. But we know that they
did go to space, so if they go to, I mean,

2834
02:40:36,411 --> 02:40:38,300
I couldn't believe that they
could go to space and a fuck.

2835
02:40:38,301 --> 02:40:41,160
I just went around from 1960 9:00 PM

2836
02:40:41,910 --> 02:40:44,610
yeah, I dunno. I Dunno. I would look,

2837
02:40:44,611 --> 02:40:48,430
I love sexy ideas and the big
sexy idea is that they didn't go,

2838
02:40:48,470 --> 02:40:50,940
that they faked it all and they somehow
or another captain for the American

2839
02:40:50,941 --> 02:40:55,270
people. That's the big sexy idea. That's
the fun one. That's, you know, it's also,

2840
02:40:55,360 --> 02:40:58,650
that time was just so
filled with bullshit.

2841
02:40:58,890 --> 02:41:02,940
That was the time of the Nixon
administration, Watergate fucking,

2842
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:07,050
I mean that was just lying. The Gulf of
Tonkin incident, they'd already faked.

2843
02:41:07,080 --> 02:41:10,860
They got us into Vietnam with
a fake fucking attack. Yeah.

2844
02:41:10,890 --> 02:41:12,420
I mean that's wild.

2845
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:17,600
Widely accepted now that the Gulf of
Tonkin incident [inaudible] didn't really

2846
02:41:17,761 --> 02:41:22,530
happen and that's, that caused more than
a million deaths. Yeah, they got us into,

2847
02:41:22,550 --> 02:41:26,970
I mean that's way crazier than the
idea of just faking a trip. Yeah.

2848
02:41:27,110 --> 02:41:31,770
Nearby it's planet. You're so right
man. And you know, as time goes on,

2849
02:41:31,771 --> 02:41:33,690
like these things do get exposed.

2850
02:41:34,300 --> 02:41:37,210
That would be a motherfucker
of a mind fuck though.

2851
02:41:37,480 --> 02:41:41,950
If they did find out that it really was
all bullshit that no one did land on the

2852
02:41:41,950 --> 02:41:46,120
moon. Yeah. Or like, or like what if

2853
02:41:46,410 --> 02:41:49,710
everything was true. All the conspiracy
shit was true. You know what I mean?

2854
02:41:49,711 --> 02:41:53,170
Like you just start finding that shit
out. I mean, look man, if, if, if,

2855
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:54,990
what's his name,
Virgin Galactic,

2856
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:59,280
you can pay in Bitcoin to get on
a fucking trip to space right now.

2857
02:42:00,310 --> 02:42:04,240
Like take me to the moon. Yeah, that's
too far. They can't really do that.

2858
02:42:04,241 --> 02:42:09,220
Did you ever hear about the fake moon
rock that was given to Holland by Neil

2859
02:42:09,220 --> 02:42:13,300
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin? No.
It was fake. Yeah, pull it up.

2860
02:42:13,301 --> 02:42:16,000
It's kind of interesting,
Jamie. It was, wait a minute,

2861
02:42:16,001 --> 02:42:19,780
it was a moon rock that was giving to
the Dutch prime minister by the Apollo 11

2862
02:42:19,781 --> 02:42:24,490
astronauts. Um, and, uh, once
they examined it, like many,

2863
02:42:24,491 --> 02:42:27,400
many years later, they were,
um, they were doing it for,

2864
02:42:27,401 --> 02:42:29,440
I believe it was for an
insurance investigation.

2865
02:42:29,710 --> 02:42:34,550
And it was actually just
petrified wood. Yeah. It was,

2866
02:42:34,570 --> 02:42:39,490
it was attached to a, you know, a whole,
a plaque that said it was there from,

2867
02:42:40,090 --> 02:42:40,421
you know,

2868
02:42:40,421 --> 02:42:45,210
Apollo 11 and Neil Armstrong and buzz
Aldrin and taking this from the moon.

2869
02:42:45,211 --> 02:42:46,044
And this is,

2870
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:49,390
and they, and they said in Buzz
Aldrin and Neil said, yeah,

2871
02:42:49,391 --> 02:42:52,630
this is really for the man. Oh yeah,
that's what it said on the plaid.

2872
02:42:53,010 --> 02:42:57,530
Well, you know, whoever gave
them the rock, I mean, it's,

2873
02:42:57,960 --> 02:43:02,960
I don't know if the actual rock was
handed to them by Neil Armstrong and buzz

2874
02:43:03,361 --> 02:43:03,871
Aldrin,

2875
02:43:03,871 --> 02:43:08,871
but it was supposedly a rock that was
given to the Dutch prime minister from the

2876
02:43:09,751 --> 02:43:14,200
Apollo ever. And astronauts
1969. And uh, it was fake.

2877
02:43:14,930 --> 02:43:17,080
Wow. Yeah, it was,

2878
02:43:19,650 --> 02:43:24,270
it was during a global tour then.
It was, it was given to them.

2879
02:43:24,630 --> 02:43:27,860
Um, 50 years. Uh, okay.

2880
02:43:27,900 --> 02:43:30,780
It says the Rock was
given to William Drees,

2881
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:34,440
a former Dutch leader during a
global tour by Neil Armstrong.

2882
02:43:34,740 --> 02:43:38,340
Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin
following their moon mission.

2883
02:43:39,930 --> 02:43:40,763
Yeah.

2884
02:43:42,130 --> 02:43:45,730
The Rock was then donated to a museum,
uh,

2885
02:43:45,790 --> 02:43:50,110
after the Dutch prime minister,
his death in 1988. And so then, uh,

2886
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:54,760
after that, I guess, uh, they had decided
to test it and when they tested it,

2887
02:43:54,761 --> 02:43:57,070
they found out that it was
actually just petrified wood.

2888
02:44:05,220 --> 02:44:06,053
Yeah.

2889
02:44:06,070 --> 02:44:08,650
I mean, who knows. I mean, maybe
it's just like they're like,

2890
02:44:08,651 --> 02:44:11,760
fuck this guy's giving. Maybe we did
go to the moon, but it's, you know,

2891
02:44:11,770 --> 02:44:12,970
rocks are valuable.

2892
02:44:13,150 --> 02:44:16,960
Sky's the Dutch prime minister given
we got some shit that looks like a moon

2893
02:44:16,961 --> 02:44:19,660
rock. Yeah. It's a symbolic gesture

2894
02:44:19,750 --> 02:44:21,790
either way that either way,

2895
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:26,620
if buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were
in the know than the men landings faked.

2896
02:44:26,710 --> 02:44:27,520
I mean,

2897
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:28,810
who knows if they were in the know,

2898
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:33,150
but if they weren't in the know then, then
even further, if they were like, dude,

2899
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:38,100
have you and I walked on the moon together
and it was just the two of us and we

2900
02:44:38,101 --> 02:44:41,040
came back. We were the only two
humans that walked on the fucking man,

2901
02:44:41,070 --> 02:44:43,770
first of all, when you think that we
would like look around and be like, man,

2902
02:44:43,771 --> 02:44:47,160
look at this shit. I mean you don't think
we would've been like, wow, whatever.

2903
02:44:47,180 --> 02:44:50,820
Some man, just what? Another place.
So by the time you get to this,

2904
02:44:50,850 --> 02:44:54,360
if somebody hands you a fucking piece
of wood is petrified wood and says, Hey,

2905
02:44:54,361 --> 02:44:56,620
this is from your moon trip,
first of all,

2906
02:44:56,650 --> 02:45:00,180
neither one of you picked
it up and brought it back
because you know that second

2907
02:45:00,181 --> 02:45:02,940
of all like wouldn't do anything.
We would know that it's not.

2908
02:45:02,941 --> 02:45:07,941
Especially if our whole life was meant
to get to this point and somebody hands

2909
02:45:08,551 --> 02:45:10,860
you this rock that you're supposed to
give to someone that has a moon rock.

2910
02:45:10,861 --> 02:45:11,730
Don't you think that?

2911
02:45:12,650 --> 02:45:14,060
I don't know.
I'm not a geologist,

2912
02:45:14,061 --> 02:45:17,270
so I could never even speculate is that
whether or not it'd be able to tell

2913
02:45:17,300 --> 02:45:18,500
where rock came from.

2914
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:21,530
Well, you'd know for sure that you
didn't pick it up and bring it back.

2915
02:45:21,870 --> 02:45:22,441
Maybe,

2916
02:45:22,441 --> 02:45:25,650
but maybe it looks a lot like a rock
that you brought back and you'd think it

2917
02:45:25,651 --> 02:45:27,630
was,
you know,

2918
02:45:27,631 --> 02:45:32,100
I don't know what the Fuck I'm moon rock
actually looks pull up a real moon rock.

2919
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:35,280
Let's, we just saw that
image is a real moon rock.

2920
02:45:35,490 --> 02:45:39,660
Well they definitely got moon rocks that
came from asteroidal impacts and that

2921
02:45:39,661 --> 02:45:44,661
was actually one of the big points of
contention because Wernher von Braun who

2922
02:45:44,821 --> 02:45:49,200
was a Nazi, a straight up
Nazi, ladies and gentlemen,

2923
02:45:49,350 --> 02:45:52,890
that's a real moon rock. Wow.
It looks like an asteroid.

2924
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:58,020
It looks like it came from,
uh, from space. It's, that's
the, the thing about, um,

2925
02:45:58,220 --> 02:45:59,670
uh,
the Werner Herzog thing.

2926
02:46:00,030 --> 02:46:05,030
Wernher von Braun rather a Wernher von
Braun was in Antarctica in 1969 before

2927
02:46:05,641 --> 02:46:10,250
the actual or 67, one of
those, um, before the actual,

2928
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:13,730
um, Moon landings took
place collecting asteroids.

2929
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:17,510
They had gone to Antarctica because
Antarctica is one of the places where they

2930
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:21,650
could be assured that a lot of the
asteroids that had landed there,

2931
02:46:21,651 --> 02:46:25,880
for whatever reason they knew were still
there, were from the moon themselves.

2932
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:29,960
So they, uh, they collected a lot of
these to examine them. Interesting. Yeah.

2933
02:46:29,961 --> 02:46:33,530
There's pictures are Wernher
von Braun in Antarctica.

2934
02:46:33,560 --> 02:46:35,630
He had a broken arm at the time.
I don't know what happened to him.

2935
02:46:36,050 --> 02:46:37,940
Maybe he's thinking about
not faking the moon. They,

2936
02:46:42,890 --> 02:46:43,723
huh?

2937
02:46:44,110 --> 02:46:48,190
There's missing moon rocks and they're
worth a lot of money on the black market.

2938
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:51,730
Yeah, I would imagine. Fucking
moon rocket will moon rocks.

2939
02:46:51,731 --> 02:46:53,860
This is what it's called. You're going
to have a moon rock in your house.

2940
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:59,410
People come over, they be fucking,
they'd think you're the shit you do then.

2941
02:46:59,890 --> 02:47:00,710
Well that's,
there's a,

2942
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:04,660
there's a whole black market for stolen
art because there's a lot of people that

2943
02:47:04,661 --> 02:47:06,790
just, they don't give a fuck.
They just want that art,

2944
02:47:07,030 --> 02:47:11,440
whether it's stolen or not stolen, you
know, they just, they just want that art.

2945
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:13,240
They could hide it and you know,

2946
02:47:13,241 --> 02:47:15,910
have people come over and bring
them to their secret layer and look,

2947
02:47:15,911 --> 02:47:20,290
this is from Egypt. This is some shit
they stole during the, yeah, Iraq.

2948
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:25,080
Oh, that's a sudden. It's
like Reagan, Reagan and the
wolf up there. That was fun.

2949
02:47:25,150 --> 02:47:28,350
We're uh, we're running out of time here
in 10 minutes we turn into a pumpkin.

2950
02:47:28,730 --> 02:47:33,670
Oh yeah, yeah. We just did three
hours and not fast man. It's,

2951
02:47:33,690 --> 02:47:36,600
it's great doing this.
I see why it zooms by.

2952
02:47:36,601 --> 02:47:39,340
It's just fun just to talk and yeah,
I mean that's it.

2953
02:47:39,350 --> 02:47:43,020
You've got the skill of being,
being like it. Your mind is alive.

2954
02:47:43,021 --> 02:47:45,990
So it's like when you talk to you,
it's like, it just, it just rolls.

2955
02:47:45,991 --> 02:47:49,450
It's like seamless information flying
all over the place from, you know,

2956
02:47:49,470 --> 02:47:50,150
back and forth.

2957
02:47:50,150 --> 02:47:55,080
Think we started talking about Scientology
and did not take one breath and got

2958
02:47:55,081 --> 02:47:58,020
all the way to the fake moon
landing and well, there's so much

2959
02:47:58,050 --> 02:47:59,940
to talk about. You know, that's the thing,

2960
02:47:59,941 --> 02:48:02,640
the beautiful thing about this world
today is there's so much God damn

2961
02:48:02,641 --> 02:48:05,580
information. Yes. It's
constantly coming at you.

2962
02:48:05,581 --> 02:48:08,850
And you can't pay attention to all of
it. If you do, you'll go mad. Like I,

2963
02:48:08,851 --> 02:48:13,290
the one thing I've get done to myself
lately is forced myself to stay offline

2964
02:48:13,291 --> 02:48:14,610
for like many,
many hours.

2965
02:48:14,810 --> 02:48:19,150
He's at a time nothing to do it. I W I
mean, I mean I would be happy not to.

2966
02:48:19,160 --> 02:48:23,210
I'm happy to throw my phone aside
cause I like, I run my own business,

2967
02:48:23,211 --> 02:48:26,290
I run the record label that we
do with my manager and like,

2968
02:48:26,670 --> 02:48:29,300
like I was packing like Sunday night,
me and my wife,

2969
02:48:29,301 --> 02:48:33,020
we're literally packing all the preorders
of like our vinyl that we did in boxes

2970
02:48:33,021 --> 02:48:34,040
and shipping them and shit.

2971
02:48:34,041 --> 02:48:36,170
And we've set up a warehouse
and we've done all this shit.

2972
02:48:36,171 --> 02:48:40,730
So like I'm stressed out all the fucking
time and I'm in the studio all the time

2973
02:48:40,731 --> 02:48:41,770
and I've got my kids autistic,

2974
02:48:41,771 --> 02:48:44,330
like when I get my kids
loved her on my phone inside.

2975
02:48:44,331 --> 02:48:49,250
But I would be real bummed if I
didn't have like didn't have, no,

2976
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:52,490
if I wasn't able to get on the Internet
because it's like part of my favorite,

2977
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:57,290
my non stress time is, is uh,
there's a game called combat arms.

2978
02:48:57,290 --> 02:48:58,190
It's like a free,

2979
02:48:58,340 --> 02:49:02,900
like first person shooter game that like
online only that me and my manager and

2980
02:49:02,901 --> 02:49:03,201
buddies,

2981
02:49:03,201 --> 02:49:06,890
we go in there and play and kill each
other and like do that kind of stuff or

2982
02:49:06,891 --> 02:49:11,550
like said on IRC and talk about shit or
like IRC dude, you're a serious game.

2983
02:49:11,790 --> 02:49:16,140
I'm on IRC all the time. I'm on there.
Right. I mean, I'm just, you know,

2984
02:49:16,530 --> 02:49:19,010
sit on there all the time and I go on.
Yeah.

2985
02:49:19,170 --> 02:49:23,310
Late at night I'll go in the bitcoin
channels, uh, on the freenode thing,

2986
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:24,330
which is there,

2987
02:49:24,330 --> 02:49:28,410
there is some kind of communication server
and talked to a lot of developer guys

2988
02:49:28,411 --> 02:49:32,940
and stuff. Like, I like a man. It's like,
that's my favorite thing to do. You know,

2989
02:49:32,970 --> 02:49:36,470
I don't do Facebook. Nah. I mean I have a,

2990
02:49:36,870 --> 02:49:39,180
I have an official page,
but I don't use it.

2991
02:49:39,181 --> 02:49:43,200
I don't like do it socially.
I'll do Twitter.

2992
02:49:43,690 --> 02:49:47,350
I always liked Twitter cause it's kind
of like a one way thing in a weird way.

2993
02:49:47,351 --> 02:49:49,890
And then I always liked
that communication better,

2994
02:49:49,891 --> 02:49:52,630
but then I got over a
little overwhelmed by it.

2995
02:49:52,631 --> 02:49:56,720
Like I used to be on all the time and
I used to like do shit all the time and

2996
02:49:57,460 --> 02:50:02,460
kind of like when I went through my
split up with my last ex or whatever and

2997
02:50:03,001 --> 02:50:05,370
there was a like I just
got really complicated.

2998
02:50:05,371 --> 02:50:08,280
There was a lot of sudden there was
like factions of people and there were

2999
02:50:08,281 --> 02:50:11,610
people commenting and there were things
that were just became kind of like weird

3000
02:50:12,030 --> 02:50:15,210
in public. And so after that I kind
of backed it off a little bit. But

3001
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:15,750
yeah,

3002
02:50:15,750 --> 02:50:19,820
if you go through something in public
and everything like is subject to other

3003
02:50:19,821 --> 02:50:24,200
people's criticisms and evaluations with
or without any information whatsoever

3004
02:50:24,201 --> 02:50:27,220
and then you watch it all play out,
you're like, why? Yeah, I see it.

3005
02:50:27,230 --> 02:50:31,100
Right around that time I had just started
to creep into Facebook and started to

3006
02:50:31,101 --> 02:50:35,000
enjoy it and I was like posting pictures
of like skeletor and shit that I was

3007
02:50:35,001 --> 02:50:35,834
into.
You know,

3008
02:50:36,180 --> 02:50:39,140
my friends and I'm like keeping up with
my friends for the first time. I'm like,

3009
02:50:39,170 --> 02:50:40,100
oh this is kinda cool.

3010
02:50:40,310 --> 02:50:43,580
And then I'll like this wave of negativity
hit me and I'm like, fuck that thing.

3011
02:50:43,581 --> 02:50:48,440
And you know what I mean? So I've
never done Facebook. And then Twitter,

3012
02:50:48,470 --> 02:50:52,910
Twitter, I kinda, I backed off
a little bit on, but you know,

3013
02:50:53,210 --> 02:50:56,720
but I like it a lot better. Like
I think, I definitely think it's,

3014
02:50:56,770 --> 02:51:01,280
it's more my speed, but like, you know,
if I had it my way, everybody be an IRC,

3015
02:51:01,610 --> 02:51:04,140
what I like about Twitter is
retweeting shit like that.

3016
02:51:04,340 --> 02:51:05,750
People Send me interesting stuff,

3017
02:51:05,751 --> 02:51:09,050
then I can send it to other people and
that motivates people to send me more

3018
02:51:09,051 --> 02:51:10,690
interesting stuff.
And so then you,

3019
02:51:10,700 --> 02:51:14,020
you got this constant network of
interesting stories coming your way. Yes.

3020
02:51:14,240 --> 02:51:15,140
That's very true.

3021
02:51:15,370 --> 02:51:19,490
There's definitely a lot of dumb shit
and gossip and stuff that people get

3022
02:51:19,491 --> 02:51:22,020
caught up in it, but that's
just human beings, man. Pete,

3023
02:51:22,040 --> 02:51:25,700
human beings love stupid shit. Yeah.
Think like to be assholes, you know,

3024
02:51:25,701 --> 02:51:30,260
and just to fuck with you to see if they
could get a rise out of you and just to

3025
02:51:30,261 --> 02:51:32,610
get you to react just so that
they know that, you know,

3026
02:51:32,660 --> 02:51:36,210
shooter Jennings is a real person on
the other end of that. Yeah, that's,

3027
02:51:36,230 --> 02:51:39,890
that's why I like to keep it where they
think I'm not real. I'm just kidding.

3028
02:51:40,210 --> 02:51:42,170
Like I don't react now.
You know,

3029
02:51:42,171 --> 02:51:45,470
it's funny like Ricky Rachman has a
buddy of mine and he was telling me that

3030
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:46,011
he's like,

3031
02:51:46,011 --> 02:51:49,850
it's funny that people write United shit
all day long and you never replied to

3032
02:51:49,851 --> 02:51:54,590
it. But like one guy says, fuck
you dude. That's why they do it.

3033
02:51:54,620 --> 02:51:57,890
You know? That's what people,
there's, there's many, many people.

3034
02:51:57,891 --> 02:52:01,580
Like sometimes someone will, I never
go back and forth with people. I just,

3035
02:52:01,670 --> 02:52:04,730
I used to, it's stupid.
It's a waste of energy.

3036
02:52:04,990 --> 02:52:07,690
But I will go online and read something.

3037
02:52:07,691 --> 02:52:11,170
If someone says something rude and then
I'll go look at their profile and I'll

3038
02:52:11,171 --> 02:52:13,320
see, even if they don't
say something rude to me,

3039
02:52:13,321 --> 02:52:15,310
I go to see if they say
rude things to other people.

3040
02:52:15,311 --> 02:52:19,890
And you find out that their whole
profile just, yeah, just, yeah.

3041
02:52:20,320 --> 02:52:24,820
Yeah. I found that out too. One time I
said something, I said that I'm a tweet,

3042
02:52:24,850 --> 02:52:27,490
this is actually, this is kind
of when I backed off of Twitter,

3043
02:52:28,090 --> 02:52:32,200
I tweeted something about John Mayer being
a giant Douche because I thought that

3044
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:33,543
like he,

3045
02:52:33,580 --> 02:52:36,880
he like all of a sudden led was the all
Hollywood and he was all played out in

3046
02:52:36,881 --> 02:52:39,790
Hollywood and then all of a sudden he
buys his place in Montana and he got a

3047
02:52:39,791 --> 02:52:41,440
Poncho and starts growing his hair.

3048
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:43,450
I'm wearing a cowboy hat and doing
all this shit. And I was like,

3049
02:52:43,900 --> 02:52:45,010
give me a fucking break.

3050
02:52:45,011 --> 02:52:47,950
But he's still hanging out at the fucking
Chateau Marmont but he's like putting

3051
02:52:47,951 --> 02:52:51,940
this image forward and I was like phony,
more of the phony shit.

3052
02:52:51,941 --> 02:52:55,500
So I just called him out on
it and like TMZ like put it,

3053
02:52:55,840 --> 02:53:00,840
I remember it was Halloween of 2012
I'll never forget it because TMZ fucking

3054
02:53:02,591 --> 02:53:06,000
puts that shit everywhere and all of
a sudden I'm getting calls from like,

3055
02:53:06,230 --> 02:53:06,870
like my,

3056
02:53:06,870 --> 02:53:10,660
like my brother and like my fan like
that they're seeing it on like the Yahoo

3057
02:53:10,661 --> 02:53:11,920
page,
like the TMZ,

3058
02:53:11,921 --> 02:53:15,630
like what says this thing
about how I called him a King
Douche and all that dude.

3059
02:53:15,640 --> 02:53:19,150
All of a sudden I had,
I'm looking at my Twitter and it says,

3060
02:53:19,151 --> 02:53:23,580
I've got like lots of mentions in the
number just keeps going up and like,

3061
02:53:23,650 --> 02:53:28,650
and like it was like 15,015 year olds
telling me what a piece of shit I was and

3062
02:53:29,250 --> 02:53:32,020
I was like, nobody and I was
doing this shit for attention.

3063
02:53:32,050 --> 02:53:35,020
I mean I've never seen.
So I just started retweeting all of them.

3064
02:53:35,021 --> 02:53:38,470
Like it was just constantly retweeting
all these people telling me what a piece

3065
02:53:38,471 --> 02:53:41,230
of Shit I was, you know? But
after that I was like, man,

3066
02:53:41,231 --> 02:53:45,040
I mean it just scared me to death.
I was like, I am as not worth it.

3067
02:53:45,190 --> 02:53:47,590
You know John Mayer? No, I've never met.

3068
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:50,870
Is it possible that he just like found
out that like having a place of Montana?

3069
02:53:50,871 --> 02:53:53,890
It's pretty cool. Probably. Are you
friends with him? I don't know him. No.

3070
02:53:53,950 --> 02:53:55,300
I already,
he's a nice guy though.

3071
02:53:56,050 --> 02:53:58,790
He hangs out at the comedy store
sometimes I have done standup.

3072
02:53:58,880 --> 02:54:02,520
I mean I know it's easy to
call him a deuce first of all.

3073
02:54:02,521 --> 02:54:05,800
He's way too pretty well I know some
girls that are brought to mind that have

3074
02:54:05,801 --> 02:54:07,530
been real fucked by only town like,

3075
02:54:07,540 --> 02:54:10,950
like some guys like you know you're
like fuck their friend and then like the

3076
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:14,020
Douche bag. So like I've kind of gotten
some wind of him that way and then,

3077
02:54:14,021 --> 02:54:17,050
but isn't that two sides of that too?
Like impossible. Those girls are,

3078
02:54:17,051 --> 02:54:19,510
is always saying and I hooked up with
him and he was like, you know what,

3079
02:54:19,511 --> 02:54:22,210
I can't deal with you anymore.
And then before you know the truth,

3080
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:27,530
Fuck John Mayer, he's an asshole. But
meanwhile he just got bored. Yeah,

3081
02:54:27,550 --> 02:54:30,190
he doesn't like them. Maybe
they're annoying, you know?

3082
02:54:30,191 --> 02:54:34,960
The same type of girls would go on
ratting them out and saying these crazy

3083
02:54:34,961 --> 02:54:37,330
things about them.
Those are also the same type of girls.

3084
02:54:37,331 --> 02:54:40,270
That would be annoying if you were John
Mayer and you were dating that girl.

3085
02:54:40,271 --> 02:54:44,740
Right? Right. Yeah, it's, he
hasn't, I mean he's ready.

3086
02:54:45,020 --> 02:54:48,340
You can say that but you could also say
like, man, I really don't like his music.

3087
02:54:48,480 --> 02:54:51,250
That's true and I really didn't like it.

3088
02:54:51,370 --> 02:54:54,730
His version of free fall on which was
like all these like 12 year old kids think

3089
02:54:54,731 --> 02:54:57,730
John Mayer this song
and then and so I had,

3090
02:54:57,760 --> 02:55:00,820
I already had issues and I'm sure that
there are people that have the same kind

3091
02:55:00,821 --> 02:55:01,451
of issues with me,

3092
02:55:01,451 --> 02:55:05,210
but it is kind of a well fact that
the John Mayer is a Douche bag.

3093
02:55:06,130 --> 02:55:10,130
I mean I can guarantee that
and it's kind of not news.

3094
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:12,410
I don't know the guy.
I don't either.

3095
02:55:12,470 --> 02:55:16,580
I will reserve judgment until I see that
makes you a better man than I and the

3096
02:55:16,590 --> 02:55:20,830
scenario, the situation, because I did
not reserve judgment. I got he, I read,

3097
02:55:20,831 --> 02:55:24,500
I'm reading this rolling saw article and
my blood is boiling because he bought a

3098
02:55:24,501 --> 02:55:28,610
ranch in Montana. Just cause he's like,
he's like putting forth this, like I'm,

3099
02:55:28,790 --> 02:55:33,470
he calls himself the new Neil young
in the article they, that he says,

3100
02:55:33,471 --> 02:55:36,380
he says, I'm this generation's Neil young
or something like that. And I was like,

3101
02:55:36,410 --> 02:55:38,300
that's what flipped the switch for me,
where I was like,

3102
02:55:38,540 --> 02:55:42,700
fuck you and your fucking body
is a wonderland. I, that's,

3103
02:55:42,850 --> 02:55:46,670
that's what it was. I mean, it's
like, you know, don't say that.

3104
02:55:46,671 --> 02:55:50,630
Don't say if he said,
if I'm this generation's Neil Neil Young,

3105
02:55:50,631 --> 02:55:55,280
the Nora Jones is this generation's
like, I don't know who he, Janis Joplin.

3106
02:55:56,440 --> 02:55:59,360
It was something, something.
So like that doesn't work.

3107
02:55:59,390 --> 02:56:02,680
It was like something even
worse that he said. But I mean,

3108
02:56:02,690 --> 02:56:04,970
just to say that just
rubbed me the wrong way.

3109
02:56:04,971 --> 02:56:09,250
I'm a huge Neil young fan and I was a lot
to learn before you're going to be new

3110
02:56:09,270 --> 02:56:10,940
young John Mayer.
Um,

3111
02:56:10,941 --> 02:56:14,330
I worked at a concert one
before I was a comedian.

3112
02:56:14,390 --> 02:56:16,760
I worked as a security
guard and great woods,

3113
02:56:17,150 --> 02:56:20,300
great woods is this place in Mansfield,
Massachusetts that has his concerts.

3114
02:56:20,690 --> 02:56:24,050
And uh, the Neil young show was the
last one I ever worked. It was like,

3115
02:56:24,051 --> 02:56:26,120
this is too fucking crazy.
I was like,

3116
02:56:26,121 --> 02:56:28,970
I got to get out because I thought I
thought it was going to get killed.

3117
02:56:28,971 --> 02:56:30,500
Like somebody who's going to get killed.
Yeah,

3118
02:56:30,501 --> 02:56:35,240
it was madness because the way
great woods works is there's um, uh,

3119
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:39,960
a covered area and then there's a
back area that's like a lawn and uh,

3120
02:56:40,280 --> 02:56:44,190
all the security people were
assigned to, uh, you know,

3121
02:56:44,270 --> 02:56:46,070
stop people from bringing in booze.

3122
02:56:46,071 --> 02:56:49,490
Like they'd bring in bottles of wine
and stuff like that, bottles of Whiskey,

3123
02:56:49,850 --> 02:56:54,720
and also, uh, to keep, keep order, like
when shit would go haywire and we'll the,

3124
02:56:54,750 --> 02:56:57,680
the lawn, the thing about the lawn
was there's no assigned seating,

3125
02:56:57,950 --> 02:57:00,500
so everybody just sat wherever
they wanted to on the lawn. Well,

3126
02:57:00,501 --> 02:57:03,470
people just started fires and
during the Neil Young concert,

3127
02:57:03,471 --> 02:57:07,220
they had to shut the concert down
because the lawn was on fire.

3128
02:57:07,720 --> 02:57:11,150
Like people would just, and then
fights broke out. And I wound up,

3129
02:57:11,151 --> 02:57:14,450
I had a security jacket on and I covered
my security jacket or it turned it

3130
02:57:14,451 --> 02:57:18,890
inside out. I remember what I did, but
I was like, fuck this job, set it up.

3131
02:57:18,891 --> 02:57:21,890
And I'm like, I'm a normal person
now, and I got the fuck out of there.

3132
02:57:21,891 --> 02:57:24,740
I remember I go, I don't even know if
I got paid for the last day of work.

3133
02:57:24,760 --> 02:57:27,110
I don't know if I punched out.
I don't remember shit.

3134
02:57:27,290 --> 02:57:30,800
But I remember saying to myself,
very, I was probably 19 at the time.

3135
02:57:30,801 --> 02:57:32,600
It was a long time ago,
but I remember saying,

3136
02:57:32,601 --> 02:57:37,010
this is the last day I work as a security
guard and it was the Neil young show.

3137
02:57:37,460 --> 02:57:39,470
Wow.
Just so crazy.

3138
02:57:39,800 --> 02:57:44,450
There was fights breaking out and fucking
bottles were flying and fire and it

3139
02:57:44,451 --> 02:57:47,000
was like,
this is what was I going to pay,

3140
02:57:47,001 --> 02:57:49,340
like 10 bucks an hour or something
stupid back then it was like,

3141
02:57:49,341 --> 02:57:53,330
this is not worth it. Wow. That's funny.

3142
02:57:53,331 --> 02:57:56,740
But it was cool that it was Neil young.
Yeah. At least you go out with a bang,

3143
02:57:56,750 --> 02:58:00,960
go out with Neil young and
that's like, you know, yeah.

3144
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:04,050
Neil Young's the shit. You know,
he lives up in northern California.

3145
02:58:04,080 --> 02:58:07,950
He's got a giant ranch ranch
up, makes his own diesel. Yeah.

3146
02:58:07,951 --> 02:58:11,280
And he's got like what he made that he
made that new iPod thing he's trying to

3147
02:58:11,281 --> 02:58:14,910
sell and he's got, yeah. What is it
like it's his own version of an MP,

3148
02:58:14,911 --> 02:58:17,670
three player. Right. I don't know how
you can jump in that game. That's,

3149
02:58:17,671 --> 02:58:20,880
that seems to me like it always seems
like a poor business decision to try it

3150
02:58:20,910 --> 02:58:24,780
because if he's not making a phone,
you're not going to beat the iPod.

3151
02:58:24,781 --> 02:58:28,800
Like nobody buys iPods. They buy
phones that have music on them now.

3152
02:58:28,801 --> 02:58:33,570
I mean there's no, it's called a Puyo
or uh, yeah, it's called Pono Pono.

3153
02:58:33,571 --> 02:58:35,190
It's like, yeah, I mean, look,

3154
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:38,850
I think it's awesome technology that
he's got some shit where it's like the

3155
02:58:38,851 --> 02:58:42,450
audio quality is way better, but I mean,
you're jumping in, that's like saying,

3156
02:58:42,900 --> 02:58:46,470
is that what the idea is? If the
audio quality's a lot better? Yeah,

3157
02:58:46,490 --> 02:58:47,850
it's is it if you're trying to Jamie?

3158
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:48,651
No,
I haven't tried it,

3159
02:58:48,651 --> 02:58:51,380
but I know that's the trying to sell
the audio files and that's, yeah,

3160
02:58:51,630 --> 02:58:53,840
but no one's listening
to music isn't made for

3161
02:58:55,730 --> 02:59:00,240
mastering for digital quality for Itunes,
so you have to breed master everything.

3162
02:59:00,310 --> 02:59:04,030
It's, it's, it's kind of weird. I mean
it seems like a losing game to jump into,

3163
02:59:04,031 --> 02:59:08,710
but yeah. Although you know,
got like him, like, I mean they,

3164
02:59:08,770 --> 02:59:12,400
they, they crowdfunded it. Yeah.
That's the weird thing, right?

3165
02:59:12,401 --> 02:59:15,640
He said it's Crowdfund,
but can you play stuff from your,

3166
02:59:16,300 --> 02:59:19,990
can you transfer stuff from your apple
from iTunes to that and will it sound

3167
02:59:19,991 --> 02:59:24,880
better? Will it play? Like how
much better will it sound though?

3168
02:59:24,881 --> 02:59:27,610
You a lot of time you're listening
to us through shitty ass. Fucking,

3169
02:59:27,970 --> 02:59:31,090
it's supposed to make an iTunes.
Tufts, I'm better. I don't believe that

3170
02:59:31,470 --> 02:59:34,860
that's what they've got some
crazy algorithm and that's
what is going on inside

3171
02:59:34,861 --> 02:59:38,550
really. But I mean, you
start getting into art.

3172
02:59:39,300 --> 02:59:42,300
This sounds better versus
just sounds better. Yeah, it
does. But I don't like it.

3173
02:59:42,390 --> 02:59:44,640
You like it. You like it.
I don't like it. Okay,

3174
02:59:44,641 --> 02:59:47,580
well let's just move on to tomorrow
because this is a silly argument.

3175
02:59:48,100 --> 02:59:48,640
Yeah,

3176
02:59:48,640 --> 02:59:52,120
but they're pointing out in this article
about it that it doesn't mean Jack Shit

3177
02:59:52,121 --> 02:59:56,230
if you don't have really good headphones
behind it, you know, it's kind,

3178
02:59:56,240 --> 02:59:58,030
kinda interesting. It will be. Well,

3179
02:59:58,031 --> 03:00:02,230
what's interesting is that like see if
people react to this and they up the

3180
03:00:02,260 --> 03:00:06,350
sound quality for phones. Video video
just died. Well we ran out of time. Yeah,

3181
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:10,450
just a heads up. Oh, all right,
well that's it ladies and gentlemen,
