1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,630
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,550
two,
one.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,090
And we're live.
Hello Denis.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,240
Hi Joe.
Great to see you.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,190
Great to be here.
As always.

6
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,740
It's great to be here.
So tell me about this,

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,160
these cards that you gave me and what 
this is all about.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,330
Okay.
Well,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,170
this is an interesting project.
This is about the RV hereclitis,

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,200
which was a,
which was associated with the Institute 

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,710
for Ecotechnics,
which is try to keep this close to your 

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:34,710
face.
Okay.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,250
There you go.
Further,

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,930
uh,
associated with,

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,140
you know,
how do I explain it?

16
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:44,340
It was actually a theater company called
the theater of all possibilities,

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,230
but the institute for Ecotechnics was 
started in the early seventies.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,480
They built the ship,
this,

19
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:52,130
this,
uh,

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,010
Chinese junk essentially with a feral 
concrete hall.

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,900
And my connection was they have Cruz 
Cruz,

22
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:05,901
the world essentially since 1973 looking
into different things relevant to global

23
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:12,111
ecology.
They've done sampling in the Antarctic 

24
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:12,111
can in 1981.

25
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:16,730
They decided to go to the Amazon and I 
was doing my graduate work in Ketosis at

26
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:22,041
that time.
So that was my connection with the 

27
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,760
Institute of Ecotechnics and uh,
you know,

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,770
at the time I thought these people are 
nuts.

29
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:33,771
I mean they were kind of nuts and they 
were very naive about what they were 

30
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:36,360
doing as far as doing ethno botanical 
work.

31
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,150
Not that I wasn't naive about it at the 
time,

32
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:42,390
but I had a better handle on it than 
they do anyway.

33
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:47,391
That was the original connection and the
same group years after I had more or 

34
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,830
less a,
you know,

35
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,910
kind of severed.
I didn't really sever my relationship 

36
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,910
but I kind of distanced myself from 
them.

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,080
But then that same group went on in the 
eighties to build biosphere two,

38
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,900
which you probably heard of.
They had financing for biosphere two.

39
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:10,670
So they've gone to a whole other level 
of ambition and,

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,180
and madness.

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,180
But um,
and biosphere two went off traveling 

42
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,120
that to people who don't know what we're
talking about.

43
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:23,121
Biosphere two was the idea of building a
terrestrial environment that was 

44
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:27,700
completely shut off from everything.
And that was self sustaining.

45
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,700
And it was a huge complex.
It was a big series of domes really.

46
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,090
Each dome replicated some earthly bio,
like the desert,

47
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,530
the rain forest,
the ocean,

48
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,170
and so on.
And the idea was that,

49
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,250
uh,
it was a,

50
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,180
it was a dry run for building a Mars 
colony,

51
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,840
you know,
or some planetary colony.

52
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:56,841
And the idea was Mars and they put 
people into this environment for like 

53
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,800
two years at a

54
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,790
to see if they could make it work,
if they could really have a balanced 

55
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:05,980
ecosystem.
Well,

56
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,290
as it turned out,
it didn't work so well,

57
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,680
but they learned a great deal from this.
And they also got a lot of adverse 

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,970
publicity because I think the,
uh,

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,980
I think the science establishment in a 
way became kind of jealous and you know,

60
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:26,131
like these people,
they don't know anything about what 

61
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:26,131
they're doing.
They got $600,

62
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:27,490
million dollars to build this.
What the hell?

63
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,490
So I got a lot of criticism,
but the fact is a lot of good science 

64
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,250
came out of this and they're still 
going.

65
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,560
And the interesting thing is they've had
their fingers in many pies.

66
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,800
You know,
they have a gallery in a hotel in London

67
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,980
called the opto October gallery.
I always stay there,

68
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,740
a fund in London,
they have a publishing company,

69
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,350
the synergetic press based in Santa Fe.

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,130
That's who published this book 
ultimately.

71
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:02,131
So it's kind of like 30 years later what
goes around comes around in the book is 

72
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Ethno pharmacologic search for 
psychoactive drugs and it's from.

73
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,690
It's labeled from 1967 to 2017.
Right.

74
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,810
And the.
And the story behind this is,

75
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,870
I'm just too,
but just to complete the hereclitis 

76
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,201
story a minute.
So the hereclitis has been plying the 

77
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:28,471
ocean more or less continuously since 
1973 and they are now renovated the ship

78
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,080
because you know it needs it,
it needs a new hole and all that.

79
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,720
So they're trying to raise funds 
obviously for that.

80
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,110
But it's just a very interesting story 
about people that are passionate about 

81
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,460
the ecology,
about the earth and about science.

82
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,940
Don't know a whole lot about any of it,
but their passion drove them forward and

83
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:57,880
and their passion.
Particularly the founder,

84
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,650
a guy named John Allen who's now,
I think he's in his eight.

85
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,680
He isn't his eighties,
but he was the visionary behind it.

86
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:10,570
And without knowing a whole lot,
they just went ahead and did it,

87
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,610
you know,
so in that spirit,

88
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,800
you have to hand it to them and they 
have,

89
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,550
they've done incredible things over that
period of time.

90
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,580
And so it's a,
it's a great story and it's worth the 

91
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,300
attention and you know,
it's up to you.

92
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:25,950
I mean,
it's of,

93
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,140
it's up to you if you want to bring her 
on or somebody.

94
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:30,070
But it's,
it's,

95
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,380
it sounds fascinating,
really romantic,

96
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,260
you know,
this escience in,

97
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,090
in the true spirit of discovery,
you know,

98
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,690
and what are they done by amateurs,
right?

99
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,020
It isn't,
is fascinating.

100
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,460
Were they trying to do,
and we're kind of research at her that 

101
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,460
they're trying to do in the ocean.
All kinds of things.

102
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,390
They've been sampling coral reefs.
They'd been sampling,

103
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,590
uh,
looking at,

104
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,910
uh,
you know,

105
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,960
uh,
global warming in both the Arctic and 

106
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:56,960
the Antarctic.

107
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,130
Uh,
they of in [inaudible] 81,

108
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:01,010
they wanted to do ethnobotany and the 
Amazon and,

109
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,460
and they had shelties on their board of 
directors and the director of the 

110
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,631
expedition was Wade Davis and,
and I was doing my graduate work at that

111
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:15,821
time and we knew they were coming.
So as a result of that I was able to 

112
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:20,740
join the expedition and we deny at the 
time he was selected by them as the 

113
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,390
chief science officer and when,
by the time I got there he was getting a

114
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:30,110
little disillusioned with them,
you know,

115
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,880
and the,
the,

116
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,090
I guess you could say the personal 
dynamic was kind of strange.

117
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,350
And like if you read my book,
the Brotherhood of the screaming abyss,

118
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:41,870
there's a couple of chapter,
there's a chapter on this,

119
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,100
but over time even weighed,
changed his mind and,

120
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,180
and I,
I now get the larger picture of what 

121
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,180
they were trying to do.

122
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,080
And you know,
it's,

123
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,940
it's a,
it's a real story.

124
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:57,941
I mean,
these people didn't recognize 

125
00:06:57,941 --> 00:06:57,941
boundaries.
That's the thing.

126
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:00,410
And they,
because they were theater people,

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,040
they actually understood,
which I didn't at the time that what 

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,110
they were doing and their whole effort 
was really a performance,

129
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,270
you know,
on a global level.

130
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:16,271
They did all these things kind of 
realizing that this was the theater of 

131
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:19,460
all possibilities and they had a theater
in Austin,

132
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:22,700
Texas by that name.
So I could.

133
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,130
It's a wild story.
It sounds like a freaky crew.

134
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,710
It's a freaky crew.
And that was the point.

135
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Well,
some of the people that were on that 

136
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,550
1981 expedition or now,
um,

137
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:37,760
they're still associated with it.
So it has some longevity.

138
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:42,260
Others have passed on,
others have left in disgust or,

139
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,030
or they,
they have enough.

140
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,470
But I was able to reconnect with the 
people that run,

141
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,590
you know,
they have this ranch in Santa fe called 

142
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:53,590
the Synergia ranch.

143
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,180
And one of the things that's based there
is this press,

144
00:07:56,181 --> 00:08:01,181
the synergetic press.
So when I was doing this project with 

145
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,730
the book I was casting around for who's 
going to publish this after we do it,

146
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,390
and they stepped up and they publish a 
lot of psychedelic stuff.

147
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:12,380
They have a book called the mystic 
chemist about Albert Hoffman.

148
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,070
Uh,
they republishes,

149
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,850
uh,
the IOWASCA reader,

150
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,810
which,
uh,

151
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,320
originally Eduardo Luna and Steven 
Dwight had published.

152
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,710
Well,
they expanded that and they published 

153
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,710
status,
a very beautiful,

154
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,060
you know,
a Redo,

155
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:32,390
essentially a second edition.
Very nice work.

156
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,120
Then I'm Don Latin,
uh,

157
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,320
who's not that well known,
but he's written several books about the

158
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:42,020
history of psychedelics and the people 
involved.

159
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:46,520
And he wrote a book that they published 
called changing our minds.

160
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,070
Ironically,
about the same time,

161
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:54,071
Michael Pollan brought his book out.
So Michael Pollan been who he is,

162
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:55,590
got all the attention.

163
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,500
Dawn's got very little,
still a good book,

164
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,320
you know,
so they're good people.

165
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:06,060
I've decided that some of my initial 
judgments,

166
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:11,061
not knowing the people and when I just 
sort of walked into their reality in a 

167
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:15,010
ketose when I got there,
you know,

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,670
which they never bothered to,
to explain.

169
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,570
It's like,
you know,

170
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,500
they never said,
oh,

171
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,150
well,
you know,

172
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,520
we're acting funny because we do things 
differently than you do,

173
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,840
you know.
And I was like,

174
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,400
what?
Well,

175
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:29,370
I'm sure they evolve to,
we were talking about they have,

176
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,060
they have evolved and they learn a lot 
through this biosphere two a,

177
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,720
you know,
project which was a real lesson to 

178
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:40,720
everybody.
Um,

179
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,360
but anyways,
so because they still existed and really

180
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:50,361
because of the,
of the resurrection of the Iowasca 

181
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:52,530
reader that had been my recent contact 
with them.

182
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:57,531
So when I decided to do this book,
I thought they were a good candidate to 

183
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:57,810
publish this book.

184
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,810
And they totally got it.
They took it on.

185
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,370
They've done an amazing job and this 
book or these,

186
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,960
this set,
as you know,

187
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,770
you know,
the genesis of it because you had a lot 

188
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,710
to do with it when we were,
when I was here last year,

189
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:15,170
you know,
in,

190
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,180
um,
the backstory is in 1967,

191
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,720
the US government,
the National Institute of Mental Health 

192
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,620
of all people put together a conference 
in San Francisco in 67 called the f no 

193
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:31,410
pharmacologic search for psychoactive 
drugs.

194
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,720
And nobody noticed.
It was a private conference.

195
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,730
It was not open to the public.
The only thing that public ever got out 

196
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,150
of it was the symposium proceedings,
which is the first book there.

197
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,240
And uh,
I was very heavily influenced by that 

198
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,050
book because somehow or other it came 
into my hands at age 17,

199
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,800
you know,
bored teenager living in peo onion,

200
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:03,801
Colorado,
wishing that I was with my brother in 

201
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:04,140
Berkeley where all the action was at the
time.

202
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,420
And I'm like,
what is this book,

203
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,640
you know?
So I totally,

204
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:13,050
I devoured it.
And about the same time I discovered the

205
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:18,051
teachings of Don Juan,
which my brother gave to me for my 18th 

206
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:22,550
birthday.
And although much in there is probably 

207
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,690
fiction,
those two books gave me a complimentary 

208
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:32,091
perspective.
The teachings of Don Juan was the 

209
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,021
ethnographic lens through which you 
could use look at the use of 

210
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:40,701
psychedelics and,
and which I kind of filled in those 

211
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,661
spaces.
Then this book came out and it was like 

212
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:45,300
at.
I knew who she was.

213
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:47,790
I knew who a few of these people were at
the time,

214
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:52,791
shelties and Shogun and Andrew while 
we're actually on the original faculty.

215
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,680
And uh,
so when the book fell into my hands at 

216
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,341
age 17,
I was very excited and I read the whole 

217
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:02,341
thing.
And,

218
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,620
and this is what really helped me focus 
my career.

219
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,620
It made me aware that maybe I could make
a career out of ethno pharmacology,

220
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,970
you know.
And,

221
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,670
and in my very naive 17 year old teenage
brain,

222
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:16,870
I thought,
wow man,

223
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,900
I can get paid to get stone was in part 
that.

224
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,620
But,
uh,

225
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,940
you know,
there was more to it.

226
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:28,570
But that's what led me to,
to pursue that career.

227
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:33,571
And so this book has always loomed large
in my sort of Pantheon.

228
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,840
Originally there was supposed to be 
followup conferences for this,

229
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,420
for the government to have every 10 
years.

230
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,340
Well,
the war on drugs,

231
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:43,600
scotched,
all that.

232
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,720
They became embarrassed that they had 
anything to do with a conference like 

233
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,530
this.
What was the goal of the conference?

234
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:54,120
Is that clear of the original 
conference?

235
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Oh,
for people to kind of report on their 

236
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,200
work.
Um,

237
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,940
and sort of mark the state of the art 
in,

238
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,610
in psycho ethno pharmacology at the 
time.

239
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,610
So the first book was really where 
things like the snuffs and I was and uh,

240
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
uh,
you know,

241
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:17,881
and other things that we don't think of 
really a psychedelics like Kava and 

242
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,350
nominated miscarrying all.
When you're saying the snaps,

243
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,530
do you mean like some of the more 
psychedelics psychedelics?

244
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:28,531
What is it called?
The a hey as that one that's an orally 

245
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:28,720
active form that.
But yeah,

246
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,510
for Rola and then,
and them Thera,

247
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,010
which is uh,
uh,

248
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,790
the,
uh,

249
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,560
what are they called?
Yotpo?

250
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,620
I think there was some easily they,
they stuff them up their nose.

251
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,570
Is that the dental or that's the deal?
Yeah.

252
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,360
Yeah.
And this is the first book.

253
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,480
The 67 book was the first one where,
you know,

254
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,930
there was a collection of the leading 
experts of the time,

255
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,260
most of whom you've never heard of.
But there were,

256
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,830
there were iconic people like shelties,
Andrew Weil,

257
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:00,710
Sheboygan.

258
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,810
Another interesting fellow,
uh,

259
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,290
many interesting people.
One of the most interesting in the first

260
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:12,080
conference was a gentleman named Steven 
Zahra,

261
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,720
a Hungarian,
a chemist and psychiatrist and 

262
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,051
pharmacologist and a,
he originally worked in Budapest and uh,

263
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,750
and eventually he moved to the states 
and became pretty high up in the 

264
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,580
National Institutes of health.
He was the director of the National 

265
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,030
Institute on Drug Abuse in the late 
fifties.

266
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,090
But the interesting thing is before 
that,

267
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,630
um,
and he was just a researcher in,

268
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,580
at a hospital in,
in Budapest,

269
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,610
he applied to Santos to get lsd.
He wanted to do research with LSD.

270
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,640
They refuse to give it to him because he
was behind the iron curtain.

271
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,240
So he,
so he synthesize dmt being a chemist and

272
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,420
he had to determine if it was actually a
psychedelic.

273
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:10,310
So it when the grand tradition he did 
that by self injecting himself,

274
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,870
you know,
so he's a true pioneer and I invited him

275
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:15,950
to the conference.

276
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,990
So he's the first person to definitively
show that the emt was a psychedelic.

277
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,130
He's now 95.
He's in great shape.

278
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,370
I invited him to the conference,
but he said,

279
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,480
well,
I'm 95,

280
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:34,481
I don't go anywhere anymore.
But he submitted a very nice video 

281
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:39,461
introduction to it.
And the other interesting thing that he 

282
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:41,300
did after the 67 conference,
he,

283
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,650
he's,
he was thinking,

284
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,230
well,
what's going on and will,

285
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:47,010
what is it with the hippies and all the 
psychedelics.

286
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,490
And,
and uh,

287
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,600
so his supervisor said,
well Steve,

288
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,900
why don't you go over to Haight Ashbury 
and hang out for awhile?

289
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,170
So he did.
And he submitted a paper called the 

290
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,741
scientist among the hippies and they 
wouldn't let him publish.

291
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,030
They said,
you can't publish this.

292
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,940
So it sat in his drawer for 50 years.
When this book came along,

293
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,150
he said,
I have something.

294
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:13,100
I'll submit here,
I don't care if they,

295
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,240
you know,
it's,

296
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,740
it doesn't matter anymore.

297
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,010
So one of the papers in this second 
volume is his original 67 paper.

298
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,570
Oh Wow.
And then,

299
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,360
so the second volume is kind of,
you know,

300
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,540
because the government didn't step up to
the plate,

301
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,690
like they said they would.
Um,

302
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,000
there was no followup conferences.
Um,

303
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,630
and I've for a long time I wanted to do 
a followup conference.

304
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,920
I wanted to do it on the 30th 
anniversary.

305
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,900
90 seven never happened.
Time passes.

306
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,700
So 2017 was the 50th anniversary.
It all fell together.

307
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,170
All of a sudden,
you know,

308
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,680
I found a venue in the UK,
a beautiful country house that was a 

309
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,470
called tearing him hauled that was run 
by one of our friends who shares,

310
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,010
you know,
our perspective.

311
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,220
He made that available.
We put the word out,

312
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,580
we got support to produce the 
conference.

313
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:14,720
So we brought about 16 people,
um,

314
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,390
you know,
to tearing ham and the England and spent

315
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,220
three days presenting.

316
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,720
And those videos are all up on the web.
I'll send you the link.

317
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,750
That's open access.
The other thing that we couldn't do at 

318
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,661
67 that we did in 2017,
there was no facebook live streaming 

319
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,540
will.
All our videos were facebook live 

320
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:37,910
straight.
We had 60,000

321
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,640
people watching these lectures at some 
points,

322
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,130
you know,
I mean,

323
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,750
so that's amazing.
That's incredible.

324
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,780
And that created excitement and then we 
basically paid for the book by 

325
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,740
preselling Greece selling that.
And a lot of people stepped up and 

326
00:17:55,351 --> 00:18:00,351
order.
A lot of people were very patient 

327
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:00,351
because I was,
you know,

328
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,320
I was,
I thought,

329
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,150
oh,
this will be out by Christmas,

330
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:03,720
right?
Well,

331
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,580
no,
it's a big project.

332
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,090
So it took six months longer than I 
thought.

333
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,700
Um,
but now it's out there and uh,

334
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,010
hopefully it'll be a,
a landmark in the field,

335
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,150
like the first one was.

336
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,150
And,
and what we wanted to do to honor the 

337
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:23,400
first one was reprint the first one 
along.

338
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,620
So that's why it's two books.
We did a high resolution,

339
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,650
a scam of the original book and 
reprinted that one.

340
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,110
And then make you think like,
imagine if Nixon wasn't president back 

341
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,210
then.
What could have been done?

342
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:44,211
Like what if they didn't have that 
sweeping 1970 psychedelic act where they

343
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:51,561
made everything illegal?
Like what if they continued with this 

344
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:51,561
stuff and who knows where we'd be today.
We,

345
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:56,230
yeah,
we could ask that question about a lot 

346
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,230
of things.
What if that didn't happen?

347
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,280
Like the psychedelic research that's 
happening now,

348
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:03,000
that's,
it's taken 40 years to get back to it.

349
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:06,780
And basically the psychedelic research 
is,

350
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,260
is a lot of the same thing was going 
back,

351
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,070
going on back in the even late fifties 
and sixties.

352
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,190
What's going on now is they're repeating
a lot of that,

353
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,660
but with more rigorous experimental 
design with,

354
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,530
with better controls and all that.

355
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,020
But it's the same stuff,
you know,

356
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,490
which is wonderful.
I mean,

357
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:27,660
I'm,
I'm all for it.

358
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,090
Um,
to see this work done.

359
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:35,091
I also have plenty to say about the 
limitations of that strictly clinical,

360
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,680
uh,
you know,

361
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,160
a sort of medical approach.
I mean,

362
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,640
I think,
you know,

363
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,580
organizations like maps and hefter half 
to work within the constraints of what's

364
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:54,010
possible.
But I think in some ways they,

365
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,610
they force themselves to,
they're forced to put on blinders in a 

366
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,360
certain way to what else is possible,
for example,

367
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:08,361
the way that a Iowasca has been sort of 
marginalized and there is research going

368
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:15,381
on about it,
but there's nothing approved in the 

369
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:15,540
states.
Uh,

370
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,600
and I think it's important to pursue 
that work,

371
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:23,601
but because you can't synthesize Iowasca
like you can silicide bonaire Mtma or 

372
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,280
these things that under clinical trials,
it's much more difficult to study within

373
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:33,540
the constraints of a phase one clinical 
trial.

374
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,020
But in fact Iowasca is touching and I 
think far more lives than say,

375
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,560
well,
I can't say about mushrooms because 

376
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,050
mushrooms are a lot out there.
But you know,

377
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:51,051
the potential,
the impact that it's having on society 

378
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:54,871
is much greater because people are 
rediscovering this and people are,

379
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:57,490
I think reaching out for.

380
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,350
They're reaching out for anything that,
that will work.

381
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:03,700
You know,
as a society,

382
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:08,701
we are spiritually bereft and I think 
there's a pervasive sense of despair and

383
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,870
a feeling of,
what would you call it,

384
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:18,871
spiritual impoverishment or something.
As we see that all of our institutions 

385
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:21,910
are becoming,
you know,

386
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,640
we're,
we're seeing behind the curtain,

387
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:27,910
I'm realizing that there are empty,
you know,

388
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,970
they don't really have anything to offer
on the spiritual level,

389
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:35,971
especially religions.
People are rejecting religions as the 

390
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:36,620
sort of,
you know,

391
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,670
Shell game that it is empty promises 
that don't deliver and I think that's a 

392
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:46,300
lot of why people are reaching out for 
these plant medicines,

393
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,730
you know,
and uh,

394
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,370
going to South America or to have 
Iowasca or,

395
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:56,371
or finding them in their own community 
because people crave spiritually 

396
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:59,470
meaningful experiences and,
and our

397
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,290
cultured needs it more than effort.
Well,

398
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:07,291
the thing about psychedelics that,
what you just said is so important that 

399
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:07,840
they deliver.
They deliver.

400
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,870
If you're skeptical about religion and 
you know there's some people that get a 

401
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,750
lot out of religion,
that's fine,

402
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,000
but if you're,
you're skeptical about it,

403
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,730
it's not going to fulfill your promises.
It's not,

404
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,700
it's not going to see.
It's not going to give you anything that

405
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:22,810
you can say,
oh my God,

406
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:27,811
this is irrefutable.
Psychedelic experiences are pretty 

407
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,530
irrefutable that something's happening.
That's titanic.

408
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,560
It's just,
it's so immense and bizarre and beyond 

409
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,831
the normal that it's hard to just 
dismiss it and the only people that 

410
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:39,700
really do dismiss it,
the people that haven't experienced it.

411
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,260
Exactly.
Exactly.

412
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,380
You know,
I mean,

413
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,390
I,
I sometimes say psychedelics are the 

414
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:48,390
antidote to faith.
You know,

415
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,930
you don't need faith to take a 
psychedelic.

416
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,910
What you need is courage,
you know,

417
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,210
religions offer faith,
which is basically saying,

418
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,240
here's a list of things that you need to
believe without question and if that's 

419
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:04,440
your inclination,
fine.

420
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,060
But most of us are more skeptical.
We need something tangible,

421
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:14,090
something more tangible.
So I think faith is a mean.

422
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,290
That's how religions entice you to 
believe.

423
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,430
But I think that,
uh,

424
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,130
in a way it's deceptive.
Why do you have to believe when you can,

425
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,300
in that intensely personal encounter 
between you and a plant teacher or you 

426
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,840
and a plant molecule and a molecule you 
can experience for yourself.

427
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,400
You don't need faith.
You can say,

428
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,490
I know that this exists and the,
the realms that it opens up for you real

429
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:47,060
because I've experienced it.

430
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,430
Um,
and you know,

431
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:51,160
I think faith,
I think that,

432
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:52,970
uh,
we in a way,

433
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,810
you know,
at least the Abrahamic religions,

434
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:01,811
Christianity and Judaism and Islam to a 
certain extent have poisoned the western

435
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:04,700
mind,
you know,

436
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,730
and,
and encouraged our separation from 

437
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,791
nature and basically propagated this 
idea that we're separated from nature 

438
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,250
and we own it and we,
we have every right to dominate it.

439
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,730
And we're seeing the consequences of 
that.

440
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,880
You know,
we have to rediscover this indigenous 

441
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,061
perspective that we are part of nature.
We're properly in properly frame.

442
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,370
We should be symbiotic with nature.
It's all about symbiosis.

443
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:39,371
It's all about collaborating with the 
global community of species to advance 

444
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,220
consciousness,
not just of our species,

445
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,370
but of the whole community of sentience 
species.

446
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:51,730
This is what the psychedelics can do.
And I think this is what the 

447
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:55,640
psychedelics are desperately reaching 
out to our species.

448
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,570
And you know,
anybody who watches my podcast or 

449
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,230
listens to me is this is my wrap.
Wake up you monkeys.

450
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,780
You know,
you're wrecking this place.

451
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,810
It's that simple.
You're recognized place and that's 

452
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,530
because you have to really understand 
your relationship to nature.

453
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:15,800
Realize that number one,
you monkeys aren't running things,

454
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,350
the plants are running things basically 
because they're sustaining life on 

455
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,920
earth.
Other things are,

456
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,170
you know,
that's part of it.

457
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,530
And then once you wake up to the fact 
that,

458
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,940
you know,
we're,

459
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,650
we're in a participatory,
collaborative role with the community of

460
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:38,651
species,
then we have to change a whole lot of 

461
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:41,120
things that we're not doing right now 
because we're certainly not,

462
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,800
you know,
developing sustainable ways to live on a

463
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:50,801
global scale and,
and we're seeing the consequences of 

464
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:50,801
this.
Now.

465
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,570
What's dismaying besides the fact that 
it's happening,

466
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:58,571
is that there is so much denial,
so much refusal to recognize this on the

467
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:04,340
part of the people that supposedly are,
are running the show,

468
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:05,170
you know,
and they're,

469
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,420
they're willfully ignorant and this is a
problem.

470
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,520
So,
you know,

471
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,640
um,
I think a lot of people will agree with 

472
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,261
me.
A lot of people who listen to this show 

473
00:26:20,261 --> 00:26:22,220
will agree with me when I say I've 
pretty much given up on politics.

474
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,730
Politics seems to me irrevocably broken.
Many other institutions are 

475
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,020
dysfunctional,
if not broken.

476
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,320
I mean sciences corrupt in government is
corrupt.

477
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,950
It's corporate,
the corporatism is,

478
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,340
you know,
these are all flawed systems because 

479
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,581
they're not,
they don't have a base of compassion and

480
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:52,641
recognition of the interrelatedness of 
all things and psychedelics are a 

481
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:58,161
catalyst for waking up and so once 
people have that experience,

482
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,030
then their perspective has changed and 
if they were influential,

483
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,970
they can go out and make change on a 
global scale.

484
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:13,050
I think it's so important that Michael 
Poem put out that book because the guy 

485
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,861
who's a mainstream straight laced guy 
who's written about architecture and 

486
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:21,241
agriculture and all these different 
things where people like really respect 

487
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:21,241
his opinions and his word.
Yeah,

488
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:26,430
this guy has not just written this book 
but has also gone out in a limb and had 

489
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,590
a bunch of different psychedelic 
experiences in controlled settings.

490
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:34,830
Right.
And talks about them and the profound 

491
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,920
impact that it had on his at one point,
skeptical mind.

492
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:39,160
He was very skeptical about what these 
things were.

493
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,980
Yale though,
I love Michael Pollan.

494
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:44,540
I have for a long time.
Um.

495
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,630
Oh,
sorry.

496
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,530
You just don't want any angry.
You know,

497
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,540
I've,
I've loved his work for a long time and 

498
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,380
I'm really delighted that he's come out 
and written about this.

499
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,380
There are some things about his book.
I have to say that I'm a little 

500
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,851
disappointed,
but then I also have to say I'm only 

501
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,270
about a little over halfway through.
It was disappointing.

502
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,540
Well,
so far he hasn't really emphasized or 

503
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,781
set much about.
He sort of writes it from the 

504
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:18,871
perspective that all of this started 
with the discovery of Lsd in 1943 and 

505
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:24,571
then that was the psychedelic era there.
Their indigenous traditions,

506
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,410
thousands of years old you shouldn't 
talk to.

507
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,590
You hasn't really talked about those 
things.

508
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,880
Well,
he knows they exist.

509
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,650
Did he talk to you at all?
He did.

510
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:35,740
Not as ridiculous.
How dare I was also,

511
00:28:35,741 --> 00:28:40,741
of course,
extremely jealous and angry and upset 

512
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:40,741
that he didn't talk to me.
I mean,

513
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:41,860
what the hell,
you know,

514
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,790
but you've been banging at the bushes 
for 60 years now.

515
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,110
Yeah.
Well come on man.

516
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,960
Seriously.
Um,

517
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,280
I'm not shower.
Why he did that?

518
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:57,281
If that was a conscious decision,
but I'm kind of disappointed because I 

519
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:58,500
think I have a perspective that,
that,

520
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,090
uh,
you know,

521
00:28:59,091 --> 00:29:04,091
I have some things to say that so far 
haven't been said in this book and 

522
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:07,820
things that Michael Pollan would,
would completely relate to.

523
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,240
You know,
he's the one that brought up the idea 

524
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,240
that,
you know,

525
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,720
with respect to like plant domestication
and on our relationship with our food 

526
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,210
plants,
you know,

527
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,000
we think we're growing.
We're cultivating plants.

528
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:22,970
Actually plants are cold fading us,
you know,

529
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,600
this is plants program for world 
domination,

530
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,650
right?
The same is true of all these teacher 

531
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,150
plants.
This is why they're out there,

532
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,350
you know,
on the global stage now and he didn't.

533
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,320
Maybe he will get to it.
I mean,

534
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,410
I'm only mildly jealous.
I wish he had talked to me on the other 

535
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:50,521
him.
What he has written is going to be 

536
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:51,480
important.
It's going to be influential.

537
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:56,510
I mean,
this will be influential to a small 

538
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,630
number of people.
Pollin's book is going to bring it to 

539
00:29:59,630 --> 00:29:59,630
the attention of millions.

540
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,890
It's going to open people's eyes and and
refresh the way people view this whole 

541
00:30:05,661 --> 00:30:07,450
subject.
I think when you.

542
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,480
When you look at when you're talking 
about ancient cultures and the use of 

543
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,421
psychedelics going back thousands and 
thousands of years and then this dip 

544
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:20,710
somewhere around 1970 where it almost 
seems to have gotten down to a very low 

545
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:24,050
hum,
but now the drums are beating again.

546
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,060
Coming back.
Now it's coming back.

547
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:31,150
Know.
I'm really fascinated and excited by 

548
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,671
that because I think this is me too.
I don't think it's the answer to 

549
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:35,390
everything,
but I think it's the glue.

550
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:41,140
I think it's there's,
there's a thing about the psychedelic 

551
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,191
experience that forces you to recognize 
that you have these pre established 

552
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:51,711
ideas of what things are and that you've
kind of put them in these boxes and 

553
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:52,650
you've sort of pushed it away and he was
like,

554
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,440
well,
I've defined what a city is and I'm just

555
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:56,430
gonna put that over there.

556
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:01,430
Now I know what that is.
I'm not going to think about that 

557
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,430
anymore.
I've defined what a road is.

558
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:06,430
I've defined me.
I remember after one of my first dmt 

559
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,011
experiences just sitting around looking 
at roads differently like I was,

560
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,580
I was on a road.
I was like,

561
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:16,581
this is the craziest shit ever week 
we've decided that it's normal to lay 

562
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:20,241
this hard surface down on the ground so 
we could roll these fire breathing.

563
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,350
Yeah.
It's so crazy,

564
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,340
isn't it?
But it was before that,

565
00:31:26,341 --> 00:31:28,290
it was just a rote.
It was always a road.

566
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,620
But after that it became this weird 
symptom of what we're doing by erecting 

567
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:37,800
these massive structures in cities and 
that,

568
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,240
you know,
we need this,

569
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,880
this,
this ground in order for us to use these

570
00:31:41,881 --> 00:31:42,780
vehicles on.
And.

571
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,320
But in the process of doing that,
we've sort of marred the landscape with 

572
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,320
it everywhere.

573
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,880
Yeah.
Well,

574
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,500
psychedelics do give us the chance to 
rethink a lot of things.

575
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:56,490
You know,
I think we've talked before about um,

576
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,530
uh,
Simon powells work he wrote about,

577
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,700
he writes about Psilocybin,
wrote,

578
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,760
um,
the psilocybin solution and that was his

579
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,950
first book and I think his latest is the
magic mushroom explorer.

580
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,220
But something in his work really struck 
me,

581
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:17,221
which is he pointed out that you have to
look that psychedelics in some sense are

582
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,640
there scientific instruments,
they give you an opportunity to look at 

583
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,081
phenomena in a way that you've never 
looked at them before because they have 

584
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:30,520
this because they take you out of your 
reference frame,

585
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:35,610
you know,
or they bring the background forward or 

586
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,161
there's different ways to describe it.
In Poland actually describes it well 

587
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:41,360
when he talks about this disruption of 
the default mode network,

588
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:47,170
it enables you to see patterns in nature
that you're programmed not to see.

589
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,090
You know,
a lot of what our brain does,

590
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:55,091
this whole reducing valve idea is it 
filters many things out.

591
00:32:56,271 --> 00:33:01,271
It lets in just enough of the external 
world that you can relate it to prior 

592
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:06,761
experiences.
What you think you know and you 

593
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:08,060
construct this artificial model of 
reality and that's the.

594
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:13,061
That's what you inhabit.
And I've said this many times may be 

595
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:13,550
worse than pollen,
may be better,

596
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:18,551
but I talk about how you know,
we're living in a hallucination 

597
00:33:18,551 --> 00:33:20,150
essentially that's constructed by our 
parades.

598
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,600
And in order to just deal with all the 
information that is available,

599
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,660
it has to really restricted at,
has to put a choke on it so that what 

600
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,610
does get in can make sense.
That's fine for ordinary consciousness,

601
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:41,711
but you are prone to overlook things 
about reality that are important and 

602
00:33:43,461 --> 00:33:48,461
psychedelics temporarily give you an 
opportunity to lower those,

603
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,360
lower those mechanisms,
that default network or sometimes called

604
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:54,350
neural gating.

605
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,090
If you're in a safe place where you 
don't have to worry about your safety,

606
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:01,070
you know,
there is no saber tooth tiger,

607
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,600
we're gonna come get you.
You know,

608
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,760
and so you don't have to worry about 
your safety.

609
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,180
Then you can just relax into it and you 
can appreciate things that are always 

610
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:13,030
there.
It's not that they're not there,

611
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,050
these are not things you imagine.
They're just things that you never 

612
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:18,050
noticed because you're programmed not 
to.

613
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,290
So tremendous learning tools.
And many,

614
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,670
many scientists have said,
you know,

615
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,690
their insights have come from their 
psychedelic experience from Steve Jobs 

616
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:32,350
to crick to kary mullis.
Uh,

617
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,630
some of these folks admitted of others,
deny it.

618
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:37,370
But it's true,
you know.

619
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,400
So there are many,
many things we can learn from 

620
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,720
psychedelics that's only one of them,
but from a scientist's perspective,

621
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:47,390
that's an important one.
You know,

622
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:50,240
one of the things I want to do is create
a system,

623
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:55,241
a situation where you can bring 
specialists together in different disc 

624
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:56,240
or in,
in a discipline,

625
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,840
say mathematics or quantum physics or 
astronomy or even whatever art and have 

626
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,650
these collective,
uh,

627
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,200
sessions together and then let people 
share their insight,

628
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:16,760
essentially creative solving,
problem solving or creative sessions.

629
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,600
And uh,
you know,

630
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,060
uh,
and that's,

631
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,640
that's the other thing I think we're 
looking for,

632
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,670
you know,
we need to develop a context in which 

633
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,520
these things can happen.
Um,

634
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,500
and that's one of the,
you know,

635
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:36,501
and that's one of the restrictions of,
of the strictly clinical approach that I

636
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:39,750
chafe against,
you know,

637
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,680
uh,
because they have to be,

638
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,320
you know,
you have to have a problem.

639
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:50,490
It has to be to treat something 
depression or ptsd or whatever.

640
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,440
But we really need to use,
you know,

641
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,310
that's not the only thing.
Psychedelics are good for sure.

642
00:35:56,311 --> 00:36:01,311
They can help people with mental 
problems and in our society who doesn't 

643
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:03,450
have mental problems,
you know,

644
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:05,790
as a society,
we're wounded,

645
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,300
but it goes beyond that.
They are learning tools and teaching 

646
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,320
tools and uh,
you know,

647
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,280
you,
you,

648
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,640
you begin to see some of this in the,
uh,

649
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,650
in the work that Roland Griffith is 
doing,

650
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:24,651
you know,
he's been able to get approval for 

651
00:36:24,651 --> 00:36:26,700
people to take psilocybin for spiritual 
development,

652
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,320
which is not exactly an illness for 
actual spiritual insights.

653
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,370
So that's approved to do this.
He is approved to do it and who approved

654
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:37,710
this and how's it.
The FDA approved it.

655
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:41,430
He's,
he's got a clinical study going on right

656
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:45,870
now where he's recruiting a religious 
professionals,

657
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,420
people who are pastors,
priests,

658
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,250
rabbis,
the moms,

659
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:55,310
other types of religious professionals 
and putting them through his protocol 

660
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,990
and that's having a tremendous impact on
the way they view their profession on 

661
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:04,860
the way they be religion.
That's fantastic.

662
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:05,610
Yeah.
It's,

663
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,050
it really is a shame that we need an 
illness to treat for you.

664
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:13,080
Allow someone to have this potentially 
mind expanding experience,

665
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:18,081
but it's almost like not allowing people
to take vitamins unless they're really 

666
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:18,081
sick.
Yeah,

667
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,290
exactly.
And like Bob Jesse says very eloquently,

668
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:28,010
we need to find context in which we can 
use psychedelics for the betterment of 

669
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,860
the.
Well,

670
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,050
you know,
for the improvement of them.

671
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,840
Well,
yeah,

672
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,460
and you can't do it right now under the 
current regulatory restrictions now.

673
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:41,550
I think it's improved.
I think it gradually will improve.

674
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,410
Um,
but this sort of ties into a,

675
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,460
you know,
what I'm trying to do now,

676
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,980
now that I've got this book off my 
plate.

677
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,070
I mean this is kind of a kind of a 
bucket list item.

678
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,680
Something that I've wanted to do for a 
long time and now it's done.

679
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:02,430
Now I have to help help sell it,
but that won't be too much of a problem.

680
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:06,090
I think it's a beautiful book,
especially after a year or two after our

681
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:07,230
show,
it'll probably,

682
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,030
we only published a thousand copies of 
those gone.

683
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,540
It would be sold out.
It's a,

684
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,600
a collector's edition and that was on 
purpose.

685
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,770
We can always print more,
but it really is beautifully done,

686
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,790
you know,
it is,

687
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:23,080
it is a beautiful book on every level 
and,

688
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,420
and the people that contributed to this,
to the second volume,

689
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:32,421
I didn't want all the same people that 
come to all always come to these 

690
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:34,170
conferences and only say the same 
things.

691
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,840
So some of the people in there are not 
that well known,

692
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,680
you know,
but they're known.

693
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,110
They were known to me and I felt that 
they had important things to say.

694
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,490
So,
uh,

695
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:50,550
you know,
some of them are known within the 

696
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:50,560
community and,
and others are pretty obscure,

697
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,330
but they,
you know,

698
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,610
there's always this,
you know,

699
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,230
this is like,
you know,

700
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,100
this passionate amateur type person who 
maybe they don't have credentials,

701
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:03,630
but they have incredible knowledge up in
their head and they're,

702
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,100
they're completely obsessed with this 
stuff.

703
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,040
And there was a few of those people in 
there too.

704
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,680
So it's really,
really a really.

705
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:16,710
It was really satisfying to be able to 
do it and make it worth people's 

706
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:21,040
People's time.
When I was able to pay for,

707
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:26,250
well me and my supporters,
a lot of it came through the Institute 

708
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:31,290
of Ecotechnics actually,
that turned out to be a good nonprofit 

709
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:31,780
channel through which we could get 
donations,

710
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:33,100
grants essentially.

711
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:38,670
Uh,
we didn't want it to go through heffter 

712
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:38,770
because it might look like a conflict of
interest,

713
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,660
silly notion,
but,

714
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,530
but,
you know,

715
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,440
because of that,
uh,

716
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,530
we were able to pull this off.
We produced the book.

717
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:50,620
We even gave everybody a modest 
honorarium.

718
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,680
So that's the way conferences are 
supposed to be.

719
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,960
But um,
what's happening for me now and actually

720
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,650
predates this and has been for a long 
time is,

721
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,280
you know,
I've been doing a lot of work in Peru 

722
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,771
for really,
I've been hosting retreats for Iowasca 

723
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:13,090
since about 2012.
And,

724
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:16,300
uh,
that's been very gratifying work.

725
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,360
I've seen transformations in people.
I see what a difference it makes to 

726
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,660
create the right environment and get 
people able to come and in a safe place.

727
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,330
And my whole approach and the people I 
work with,

728
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,360
there are whole approaches.
We're not here to tell you what's 

729
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,360
supposed to happen.

730
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,180
We're here to create an optimum 
condition and you work it out.

731
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:48,390
This is a,
this is a dialogue between you and the 

732
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,850
plant teacher.
You know,

733
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,620
it's not the Shaman,
the Shaman,

734
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,420
if it's a good,
he was a good showman,

735
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,680
facilitates that process,
but does not try to control it.

736
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:01,090
He's there for support.
He or she is there for support.

737
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,320
What really happens is the interaction 
between,

738
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,400
I mean the,
the,

739
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:08,860
the,
the medicines or the real teachers.

740
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:14,190
And we're here to facilitate that.
And also to tell people if they need 

741
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,060
help integrating it or figuring it out,
that's fine.

742
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,590
But that's different than saying,
well,

743
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:23,800
this means that.
And you're supposed to think about it.

744
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:27,130
You're supposed to think about whatever 
you want,

745
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,210
you know,
I mean,

746
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:32,380
you're supposed to learn to use your own
mind to think for yourself.

747
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:38,170
So the extension of this is that I'm in 
the process,

748
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:39,530
uh,
of,

749
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,130
uh,
I guess manifesting this idea and uh,

750
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:51,580
what I'm,
what I'm working on now is I want to 

751
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,870
create an academy in the Sacred Valley,
which,

752
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:58,910
uh,
is an academy of natural philosophy and 

753
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,550
law.

754
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,820
And so I have a name for it because a 
lot of people have told me that,

755
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,480
uh,
you know,

756
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,940
your name has got to be in,
in this,

757
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,690
and I'm a kind of a selfie facing guy,
but,

758
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,960
um,
I recognize that I have a certain iconic

759
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:16,070
recognition,
so.

760
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:17,720
Okay,
if that's what it takes,

761
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I'll do it.
So what we're going to call it is the 

762
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,190
Mckenna Academy for Natural Philosophy.
And um,

763
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,630
by academy you're saying you don't have 
a physical structure.

764
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,170
We will have a physical structure.
Yeah.

765
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,360
And maybe more than one,
but we have identified an initial place 

766
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,130
that will be the physical location for 
it.

767
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,810
And it's,
it's a kind of school.

768
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:46,811
It's kind of,
it is in fact the first psychedelic 

769
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:47,480
university,
if you will,

770
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,840
sense this was sacked and burned by the 
goths in three 96 a day.

771
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:58,161
It's the first psychedelic university in
the western tradition since then.

772
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,520
So you're going to have structured 
courses,

773
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:03,830
you're going to have degrees,
all of that.

774
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,200
We're going to have courses.
We're going to have.

775
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,200
It's going to be much more than a 
retreat center.

776
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,610
We're going to have retreats.
We're going to have therapeutic programs

777
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:17,810
for people to get treatment and programs
for people to,

778
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,940
you know,
learn to use psychedelics for therapists

779
00:43:20,941 --> 00:43:25,130
to learn to use them,
but that is not the whole program.

780
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,890
The idea that we're going to have 
conferences,

781
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,190
global impact conferences along the 
model of this,

782
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:33,020
this,
this,

783
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,280
this conference was what made me realize
this possible.

784
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:42,670
We're going to have impactful 
conferences that will really have a 

785
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,280
global reach and through,
um,

786
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,010
you know,
webinars,

787
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:52,070
what through the web we can share this 
with thousands of people and it will be 

788
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:55,760
a place for it.
It will be a place for,

789
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,880
you know,
the second part of the,

790
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,910
of the title is,
so it's the mechanic academy of natural 

791
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,910
philosophy.

792
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,100
What's natural philosophy?
Natural philosophy is what science used 

793
00:44:09,591 --> 00:44:14,591
to be called before it became corrupted,
before it became preoccupied with 

794
00:44:15,801 --> 00:44:18,740
quantitation before it became 
reductionist.

795
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:24,340
All of the things that have constricted 
the scope of science.

796
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:29,590
This is going to be a more open thing 
that doesn't depend on corporate funding

797
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:32,760
and that sort of thing where first of 
all,

798
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:37,761
we recognize that scientific knowledge 
is valuable and we embrace that.

799
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,330
But we also recognize that they has 
inherent limitations,

800
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,360
just by the nature of the beast,
it has hinton inherent limitations on 

801
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,220
certain things are difficult to,
you know,

802
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,570
to investigate within that rigid 
framework.

803
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,510
And,
but they are,

804
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,320
that doesn't mean they're not worthy of 
investigation,

805
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,600
you know,
you mean psychedelic experiences.

806
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,270
Very difficult to investigate as many 
other things,

807
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,160
paranormal,
you know,

808
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,800
um,
all of these things that people,

809
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,080
you know,
stigmatized as,

810
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,130
as Wu and crazy,
you know,

811
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,690
and I,
we're not going to.

812
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,080
The idea is to bring rigor to these 
things to say yes,

813
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:22,170
there are a lot of phenomena that we 
don't understand.

814
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,630
It wasn't a normal phenomenon fascinates
you,

815
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,000
will you name it?
I mean,

816
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,240
Ufo shows is a good example.
Um,

817
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,150
you know,
nobody really knows what's going on with

818
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:38,151
you for all we know is that people have 
these experiences and what are they,

819
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,770
what are those experiences?
Are they extraterrestrial encounters?

820
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:48,771
We don't know.
A lot of them don't really fit that 

821
00:45:48,771 --> 00:45:51,140
mold.
Are they hallucinations or altered 

822
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,960
states or is there really something,
you know,

823
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,690
in the continuum that we,
uh,

824
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,720
you know,
that only manifests under certain 

825
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,900
circumstances and,
and the idea is that,

826
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,080
you know,
science,

827
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:13,790
uh,
especially in this era tends to 

828
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,461
transform itself into Dogma and then 
that becomes dismissive of aspects of 

829
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:24,831
the world that are worthy of studying,
but they don't fit into the scientific 

830
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:25,530
pattern.

831
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,150
And so we dismissed them.
I mean,

832
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:30,060
a good example of this is Graham 
Hancock's work,

833
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:35,390
for example,
that he talks about and many other 

834
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,061
people,
mainstream archeology is not open to 

835
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:41,751
this idea that becoming more open to it 
by force data too because more and more 

836
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:43,560
evidence is showing.
But look,

837
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,400
look at how long it's taken him to a,
you know,

838
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,530
knocking on the doors bed and these 
people over the head practically that 

839
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,810
look at this evidence.
It's very nice though to see him finally

840
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:58,650
get it.
It is pretty far from over,

841
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,490
but he's definitely gaining ground.
Definitely gaining go for Allie Tabay.

842
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Yeah.
And can you imagine how that would 

843
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,720
change our view of humanity or 
evolution,

844
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,270
this whole thing?
So archeology is a good,

845
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,720
a good example.
Psychedelics are another good example.

846
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:20,740
It's opening up,
but for years after the initial 

847
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,210
excitement about psychedelics and the 
fifties and sixties,

848
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,880
the whole thing was suppressed for 40 
years.

849
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,330
Michael Pollan talks about this.
What we're doing now is rediscovering,

850
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:36,870
you were a psychiatrist in training in 
the eighties or the seventies or the 

851
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,250
eighties.
You wanted to talk about psychedelics.

852
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,980
That was the end of your career.
You could not even bring this up,

853
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,120
you know,
and,

854
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,380
and who knows.
So it's one of these situations where 

855
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:56,000
it's kind of stunning when you think 
about the fact that in the sixties it 

856
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,351
probably was possible.
It was before it was made completely 

857
00:48:00,351 --> 00:48:03,561
illegal to discuss and I'm on this 
conference was performed by the 

858
00:48:03,561 --> 00:48:04,590
government,
1967.

859
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,240
Right.
And then the laws changed and laws about

860
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:14,241
these sorts of things should never be 
made by politicians because they always 

861
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:14,241
have,

862
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,980
you know,
a different agenda and they're not 

863
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,300
qualified to make these kinds of laws 
and they're largely,

864
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:26,380
you know,
idiots or the ones that really control 

865
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,500
power.
They're not informed about psychedelics.

866
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:33,550
Psychedelics were blankets prohibited 
all at once,

867
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,870
pretty much,
and it was,

868
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,800
the focus was all on Lsd.
All these other things got swept up into

869
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:44,801
this hysteria.
Essentially this hysteria that 

870
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:47,690
psychedelics were gonna change the youth
and Change Society.

871
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,730
And you know what,
they were right?

872
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,790
They were absolutely right.
They were not stupid in that sense.

873
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:54,540
Uh,
you know,

874
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,540
it did bring out these changes,
but now we're past that.

875
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,110
So

876
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,750
sciences again,
slowly opening up,

877
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,250
you know,
to,

878
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,040
uh,
to psychedelics.

879
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,720
And I think that's a good thing.
Um,

880
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,930
I think people were appreciative of it.
Now that we know that we have gone 

881
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:16,351
through that dip where it was outlawed 
and stigmatized and people were never 

882
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:16,360
talking about it.
Like,

883
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,070
you know,
just a few years ago,

884
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,470
I mean,
I want to say early two thousands.

885
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:26,471
You talk about mushrooms or any sort of 
psychedelics and people would look at 

886
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:26,471
you like you're crazy.

887
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,820
Well,
Joe,

888
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,440
I mean,
to his credit,

889
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:34,950
he was one who continued to talk about 
it all through the seventies,

890
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:37,690
the eighties and nineties.
I mean,

891
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,670
and I give him tremendous credit for 
that because he was dismissed and he was

892
00:49:42,671 --> 00:49:47,671
out there.
He was a pioneer and I think he really 

893
00:49:47,671 --> 00:49:49,600
had a lot to do with keeping this 
conversation alive.

894
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,440
That along with the fact that,
you know,

895
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,840
uh,
largely through our efforts back in the 

896
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,321
seventies,
but other people contributed like 

897
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:03,740
statements of other people,
but we published this little pamphlet,

898
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:08,770
the psilocybin mushroom magic grower's 
guide which put in the hands of,

899
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:14,710
you know,
every nerdy 10th grader essentially the 

900
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:18,251
tools to grow psilocybin mushrooms.
And that's how it got out to the world 

901
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,470
and our motivation.
When we did that,

902
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,440
it was partly mercenaries.
Yeah,

903
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,330
we can grow mushrooms,
make a lot of money.

904
00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:27,980
Why don't we,
we grew mushrooms,

905
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:33,110
we made some money.
But the real motivation is we wanted 

906
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,540
people to be able to verify our own 
experiences.

907
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:40,541
The stuff that we experienced at La 
Chorrera was so nuts that we thought 

908
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,270
either we're completely diluted or 
there's something going on here.

909
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:49,070
So we needed affirmation from a wider 
community that,

910
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:54,160
hey,
there is really weird shit going on 

911
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:54,410
here.
And we put it out and it's now,

912
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:59,660
you know,
mushrooms are probably a for,

913
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:05,290
I'd say for most people,
they're the first psychedelic that they 

914
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:05,290
encounter,
you know,

915
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:09,850
maybe lsd.
But chances are these days it's 

916
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:09,850
mushrooms.
Well,

917
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:10,700
your brother was such a compelling 
speaker.

918
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,460
I mean tests.
Terrence was so interesting.

919
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,070
Like his,
his speech pattern was fascinating.

920
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,260
I mean,
it was part of the thing.

921
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:23,261
It was the theater of his,
his speeches and lectures there were so 

922
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:23,890
interesting,
you know.

923
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,400
And he also was,
he,

924
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:31,730
he was so obviously engrossed in these 
subjects to the point where he's very,

925
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,250
very attached to them.

926
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,760
It was,
there was a deep connection and he,

927
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:42,790
you know,
when you would hear him talk and be 

928
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,790
like,
shit,

929
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,790
I gotta get some of this stuff.
Yeah,

930
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,790
yeah.
No,

931
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,120
he was a compelling speaker.
I mean,

932
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,170
I,
I don't,

933
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,900
I don't rise to that level.
Sorry.

934
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:50,810
I've just not.
Although occasionally,

935
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,030
you know,
I can kind of channel him,

936
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,890
but um,
but I have stuff to say.

937
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:57,030
I don't say it as well as he does,
but we,

938
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,680
we were so much on the same wavelength 
about this.

939
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:02,090
So I,
I,

940
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,560
he was the bard of psychedelics 
throughout the seventies,

941
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:10,100
eighties and nineties,
and refused to,

942
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,230
you know,
when no one else was talking about it,

943
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,760
he was talking about it.
So I gave him a lot of credit for.

944
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:18,640
He kept the emperor.
Yeah.

945
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,060
Yeah.
To do that.

946
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,040
When you were talking about La Chorrera,
uh,

947
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:27,070
your experiences,
didn't you guys have some sort of a ufo 

948
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:27,070
experience when you were there?

949
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:27,320
Yes,
we did.

950
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,730
Or he did.
He did.

951
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,380
Anyway.
Yeah.

952
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,270
Interestingly,
um,

953
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,600
um,
I recently,

954
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:40,601
you know,
I've talked about Lacera probably far 

955
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:43,661
too much and I don't really like to talk
about it too much because it's so hard 

956
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:45,190
to explain and with,
uh,

957
00:52:45,191 --> 00:52:45,850
you know,
and to,

958
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,760
to discuss it,
you get off into these for,

959
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:53,860
for the uninitiated that we're talking 
about in project into these rabbit holes

960
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:56,150
of,
of explaining.

961
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:57,630
But I gave a,
a.

962
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,640
I'm a lecturer to breaking convention 
last year in the UK and in at the end of

963
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:09,500
June they have breaking convention.
Another big psychedelic conference.

964
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:14,501
And I,
my title of my talk was the experiment 

965
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:17,870
at Lusher era,
psychotic break,

966
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:22,930
shamonic initiation or alien encounter 
question mark.

967
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:25,620
We're all of the above or all of the 
above.

968
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:26,100
Well,
that's

969
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:31,100
the thing,
but my sort of the theme of this talk 

970
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,301
was if you look at the,
uh,

971
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,390
what you might call it,
the,

972
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,160
the,
the,

973
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,200
the,
the topology,

974
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:45,201
the typology of alien encounters.
There are certain patterns that come up 

975
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:48,690
again and again.
And if you tick those off,

976
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,370
if you say,
you know,

977
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,520
for the experiment lecturer era,
they're all present in a certain way and

978
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:57,100
there has to be,
you know,

979
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,900
the typical alien encounter.
It's kind of an oxymoron.

980
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:05,901
What's typical about an alien encounter.
But there are certain characteristics 

981
00:54:05,901 --> 00:54:10,520
and one of the characteristics is there 
has to be a calling and there has to be 

982
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,871
a siren call.
Write something compels you like in a,

983
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:20,840
in a Spielberg movie,
close encounters of the third kind that 

984
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:20,840
was,
you know,

985
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,440
the,
the table mountain,

986
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:26,130
you know,
and somehow this guy was compelled to go

987
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:26,490
there.

988
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,000
Well,
there was a siren call in,

989
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,410
in our experience.
It was DMT,

990
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,140
you know,
and we were just students,

991
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,300
you know,
terence was at Berkeley,

992
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:41,301
I was in University of Colorado,
but we were both fascinated by dmt and 

993
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,120
we were compelled to go look for this 
orally active form of DMT.

994
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,570
Woo Hoo.
Hey.

995
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:53,010
Which when we finally got it,
turned out to be not very exciting,

996
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,050
but we,
it took us to La Chorrera.

997
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:58,680
That's why we went to Lucha Libre was in
quest of this thing,

998
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:02,910
which we called the secret when we got 
to La Chorrera what was really.

999
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:07,911
There were mushrooms everywhere in the 
pasture that quickly reorganized our 

1000
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:10,470
priorities.
Right?

1001
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:15,530
And,
and it was though we were in the 

1002
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:16,530
presence of this intelligence and it 
presented itself very much.

1003
00:55:16,531 --> 00:55:21,531
We called it the teacher and it was 
downloading all of this information to 

1004
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:26,601
us.
And that was another characteristic of,

1005
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,320
of alien encounters.

1006
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,850
Generic alien encounters usually involve
the transfer of special information.

1007
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,910
People are shown a book or they're 
shown,

1008
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,060
you know,
uh,

1009
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,790
something that is transmitted from the 
teacher to the recipient.

1010
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,920
And we,
we got that in spades.

1011
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:48,921
We got this encounter and it had those 
characteristics.

1012
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:52,620
And then another characteristic is 
there,

1013
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:57,621
there is,
so information is given and gifts are 

1014
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:57,840
given,
you know,

1015
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,900
and the information that was transmitted
resulted in a couple of things.

1016
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,040
Well,
the primary thing that that came out of 

1017
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,650
that was terrence's idea about the time 
about timewave and teaching.

1018
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:16,870
The genesis of that idea came out of the
experiment that lecturer and then over 

1019
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:22,050
decades became refined and developed.
Now,

1020
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:25,630
whether there's any to it,
I'm not sure.

1021
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:28,640
I've always been very skeptical about it
and you know,

1022
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:31,060
it,
it failed its major test,

1023
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:36,061
which is the space time continuum did 
not collapse on December 20,

1024
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:39,460
first 2012 as was predicted.

1025
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,220
But there are interesting things about 
the,

1026
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:47,280
about the timeline,
if it's just an interesting thing 

1027
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,370
considered,
um,

1028
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:54,570
you know,
in its own context as a strange 

1029
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,080
mathematic whole construction that in 
many ways as a reflection of terrence's 

1030
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,440
psyche,
he was the only one that could really 

1031
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,441
understand it and interpret it.
This is a bunch of people listening 

1032
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:07,441
probably don't know what we're talking 
about.

1033
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:09,010
We're talking about timewave zero,
timewave zero,

1034
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:14,060
right?
And we wrote the invisible landscape in 

1035
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,130
our first book for people who have no 
idea what we're talking about.

1036
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:16,660
Explain what timewave zero.
Okay.

1037
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:22,410
Rhythm essentially that he essentially 
it was an algorithm based on the 

1038
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:26,781
structure of the each thing.
This oracle of 64 hexagrams,

1039
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,280
and he treated it in such a way that he 
claimed it,

1040
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,770
it describes that time had a structure 
and that this thing was that this,

1041
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:43,270
this timewave describe the structure of 
time essentially,

1042
00:57:43,271 --> 00:57:46,780
and thus was a predictive tool among 
other things.

1043
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,820
And that it,
uh,

1044
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:53,850
you know,
was a way to look at the ingression of 

1045
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:59,341
novelty into the continuum.
The idea that there really are new 

1046
00:57:59,341 --> 00:58:04,321
things under the sun,
new things happen that have never 

1047
00:58:04,321 --> 00:58:06,580
happened before ever in the history of 
the universe.

1048
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:11,610
And this map was a way to predict the 
eruption of those things or the 

1049
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,840
ingression of those things,
I think,

1050
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,500
which is a better term.
And terrence and I used to have,

1051
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,440
you know,
I wouldn't call them arguments,

1052
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:23,020
I'd call them heated discussions,
uh,

1053
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:25,750
or enthusiastic discussions about how 
this happened.

1054
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:29,650
I do not disagree with the principle 
that there is novelty.

1055
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:33,430
I'm not sure the timewave really 
describes it adequately,

1056
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:35,860
but it was a,
it was a attempt to,

1057
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,490
and uh,
and whatever it was,

1058
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:44,320
it was something that was a gift from 
this teacher,

1059
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:47,320
at least the,
the nugget of the idea that.

1060
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,470
Right.
The other thing that came back,

1061
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:55,530
the other gift that came back from La 
Chorrera was nothing supernatural or 

1062
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,270
anything like that.
The gift was the spores of the mushroom.

1063
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:07,020
We took the spores of the mushroom and 
we took them back with us and then over 

1064
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:11,641
two or three years we figured out how to
grow them and we shared that with the 

1065
00:59:11,641 --> 00:59:15,790
rest of the world.
And that was really the thing that,

1066
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,970
and look at the impact that that's had 
on society.

1067
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:21,350
You know,
and terrence was fond of saying,

1068
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:22,910
terrence did say,
you know,

1069
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:27,940
we are in a symbiotic relationship with 
something that has disguised itself as 

1070
00:59:29,871 --> 00:59:33,590
an alien invasion in order not to alarm 
us.

1071
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,170
Right.
So,

1072
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:37,850
and that's what it was.
And,

1073
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,780
and before you know it,
every nerdy 10th year,

1074
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:45,410
a 10 year old in basements across the 
country,

1075
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:50,470
you know,
we're growing mushrooms and able to do 

1076
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,840
it because the [inaudible] the technique
was very simple.

1077
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,050
So it's all about what's Johnny doing 
down in the basement,

1078
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:54,620
honey,
oh,

1079
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:56,630
I don't know,
some science project,

1080
00:59:56,631 --> 01:00:01,631
something about growing mushrooms.
So effectively the alien invasion was a 

1081
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:06,470
complete success,
not a shot was fired,

1082
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,800
you know,
and now here we are and no one's even 

1083
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,111
realized that it's an alien invasion.
Do you subscribe to the idea that 

1084
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:18,191
mushrooms came here and perhaps on 
asteroids that it was a Panspermia sort 

1085
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:18,480
of situation?
Oh,

1086
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:20,990
I don't know.
I don't subscribe to that idea.

1087
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,600
Whose idea was that?
Well,

1088
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,610
terrence's idea,
you know,

1089
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:30,700
um,
and the idea of Panspermia I don't 

1090
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,780
necessarily disagree with that.
I think that may well have happened.

1091
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,400
Um,
you know,

1092
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:39,490
that that life came from on an asteroid 
or is the building blocks the building 

1093
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:43,100
blocks of it.
But mushrooms as such,

1094
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:46,760
we know too much about the phylogeny of 
mushrooms.

1095
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:51,110
We know where they fit into the 
phylogeny of life on earth.

1096
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:56,470
And it can't really make the case that 
they were extraterrestrial because there

1097
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:59,610
were mushrooms,
you know,

1098
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,930
their mushrooms and they're part of,
you know,

1099
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:06,590
they have a position in the well defined
phylogeny of fungi,

1100
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,650
which are some of the most ancient 
organisms,

1101
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:14,651
I mean,
some of the most earliest macro or a 

1102
01:01:14,651 --> 01:01:17,210
terrestrial organisms that were of a 
macro scale.

1103
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:18,590
We're fungi.
I mean,

1104
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:23,591
there were big fungi on,
on interest rate environments before 

1105
01:01:23,591 --> 01:01:27,851
there was much of anything else,
but they weren't siliciden mushrooms 

1106
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:32,290
presumably have you paid attention to 
this most recent theory that perhaps,

1107
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:37,630
uh,
the ancestors of octopus might have 

1108
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,360
somehow or another gotten here from an 
asteroid that there,

1109
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:44,420
there's something about their unique 
ability to alter their rna which is 

1110
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,330
unique in the animal kingdom.
I have heard about that.

1111
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,600
Um,
and I have a legit sources apparently.

1112
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:53,180
Right.
It's not a real legit sources,

1113
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:53,690
honestly.

1114
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,020
I haven't read far enough into that to 
just decide.

1115
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,120
Um,
but if anything,

1116
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,920
it seems like an alien.
Yeah.

1117
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,910
Well,
they certainly look.

1118
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,240
They look like our idea of an alien.
Yeah.

1119
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:10,340
Really.
We probably looked like aliens to 

1120
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:10,340
octopus,
so.

1121
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:10,340
Sure.
But,

1122
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,510
you know,
another,

1123
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,080
um,
another interesting,

1124
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,800
maybe interesting angle on this was I,
um,

1125
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:21,150
uh,
yeah,

1126
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:26,151
I think it was 2015.
I was invited to another private 

1127
01:02:26,151 --> 01:02:29,661
conference actually at tiering ham and 
the subject of the conference was dmt 

1128
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,400
entities and uh,
you know,

1129
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:38,410
are the entities you see on Dmt,
are they real or not tall order?

1130
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:44,790
Very difficult to really unpack that for
one thing.

1131
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,820
What do you mean by real?
Let's start there.

1132
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,430
Anything you experienced is real,
right?

1133
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,920
You know,
so start there.

1134
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:57,060
Um,
but the talk that I presented was called

1135
01:02:57,061 --> 01:03:02,061
a is dmt a messenger molecule from an 
extraterrestrial civilization.

1136
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:06,510
That was the title of my talk.
And I actually,

1137
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:12,350
in the course of preparing the talk,
I had to conclude that probably not,

1138
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:18,350
you know,
because if you're going to postulate 

1139
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:18,930
that what you really have to talk about 
is uh,

1140
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:24,560
the origin of tryptofan because 
tryptofan the amino acid which is found 

1141
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:29,601
in everything.
It's one of the 20 that goes into 

1142
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:32,211
protein.
Tryptofan is the precursor to all these 

1143
01:03:32,211 --> 01:03:34,800
psychedelic tryptamines and,
and also including Serotonin.

1144
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:40,220
You know,
dmt is kind of the archetypal 

1145
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,890
Psychedelic,
but you've got silicide been siliciden 

1146
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:44,490
five methoxy before [inaudible] and even
the Beta carbon lanes.

1147
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:49,491
So,
so if you look back in Phylogeny,

1148
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,670
um,
you know,

1149
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:56,760
a billion years,
a couple of billion years,

1150
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:01,560
eventually you're talking about what 
they call the trip opera,

1151
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:07,310
which is the cluster of genes that give 
rise to tryptofan.

1152
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:12,930
So we pretty certain you're not talking 
about is dmt extraterrestrial in origin.

1153
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:14,460
You have to say,
well,

1154
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:15,530
obviously it's,
it,

1155
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:20,560
it came from tryptofan.
So how'd the trip on a arise in 

1156
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:26,001
phylogeny it was that extra terrestrial,
even though it's one of the most 

1157
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:26,960
ancient,
uh,

1158
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,810
gene clusters in,
in the evolution of life,

1159
01:04:30,811 --> 01:04:34,530
you can't really make the case that it's
extraterrestrial because you could say,

1160
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:36,030
well,
it came from,

1161
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:41,420
um,
Rhodopsin actually the genes that the 

1162
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:46,080
trip opera opera on originated from 
originally where the genes that the same

1163
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:51,081
genes that code for Rhodopsin,
which is the pigment in the eye that 

1164
01:04:51,081 --> 01:04:54,720
responds to light.
So I ended up,

1165
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:59,250
I could make the case that dmt is extra 
terrestrial and,

1166
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,100
but is that a,
it's been an interesting case.

1167
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:03,720
Like whether or not it's from another 
planet,

1168
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,220
whatever it is,
it's,

1169
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:09,030
it doesn't seem like it's here.
The experience does it.

1170
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,180
It doesn't seem like it's here.
Right.

1171
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,680
But,
but then again,

1172
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,620
where is here,
you know,

1173
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:21,440
eventually I defaulted to say it may not
be an extra terrestrial messenger 

1174
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,430
molecule,
but it is a messenger molecule and it is

1175
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:28,420
a distinctly terrestrial messenger 
molecule.

1176
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:33,420
It is the messenger molecule that has 
been adopted by the community of species

1177
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:40,030
to talk to the monkeys and try to,
you know,

1178
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:44,260
talk to our consciousness and maybe even
to trigger consciousness.

1179
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:49,590
So dmt is only two steps from tryptofan 
and somatically and cellular metabolism.

1180
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:57,830
Tryptofan is universal,
not a living thing that we know of that 

1181
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:02,311
does not contain trip to fan because 
it's one of the 20 that go into amino 

1182
01:06:02,311 --> 01:06:06,841
acids to steps from Tryptofan,
decarboxylation and,

1183
01:06:07,181 --> 01:06:10,730
and methylation is all it takes to get 
dmt.

1184
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:15,750
And that's like the prototypal 
tryptamine psychedelic and the enzymes 

1185
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:23,740
that catalyze those steps.
They may not be universal in organisms,

1186
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:28,770
but they're pretty darn near universal 
because they have all sorts of other 

1187
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,000
cellular housekeeping functions.
You know,

1188
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:35,170
decarboxylated amino acids as something 
that goes on in every cell,

1189
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:39,850
sticking methyl groups on nitrogens is 
maybe less,

1190
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,910
less common,
but still very common,

1191
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:46,950
you know,
enzymes that will move a methyl groups 

1192
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:50,230
around in sales so you can make the case
that,

1193
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:55,030
and we know this,
dmt is extremely common in nature.

1194
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:58,690
DMT is.
I said nature is drenched in Dmt,

1195
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,200
you know,
from the animal level to the plant 

1196
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:04,200
level,
to the fungal level.

1197
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,010
You find these things everywhere.
Um,

1198
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,470
you know,
um,

1199
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:08,830
and people say,
well,

1200
01:07:08,831 --> 01:07:13,060
there's about a hundred and 50 species 
of plants that contain dmt.

1201
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,320
That's only because we've only looked at
150 species of plants.

1202
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:22,670
You know,
if you look at these large genera that 

1203
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:22,670
are,
that are,

1204
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:25,180
you know,
famous known for having tryptamines like

1205
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:28,960
Acacias and my Moses and these things.
Uh,

1206
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:33,610
we know of a few species that have dmt,
but there's hundreds of species,

1207
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:36,370
thousands of species.
It's just that nobody's looked.

1208
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,400
Nobody's going to fund this work.
I think you can reasonably say that you 

1209
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,931
know,
there are about 1400 species of Acacia 

1210
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:50,260
in the world.
Probably 75 percent of them have dmt and

1211
01:07:50,261 --> 01:07:53,020
actually I would go to the next.
I would.

1212
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:57,910
I would even claim without evidence.
That's never stopped me before,

1213
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:03,780
but I think it's reasonable to suppose 
that because dmt is so close to 

1214
01:08:04,091 --> 01:08:09,091
mainstream metabolism,
probably all plants have dmt to some 

1215
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:11,740
extent.
Most don't have large,

1216
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,650
large levels of it.
They don't have useful amounts of DMT,

1217
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:16,100
but if you

1218
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:21,100
took with sufficient instruments,
if you just started ranting randomly 

1219
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:25,991
sampling plan,
some analyzing for dmt with the Mass 

1220
01:08:25,991 --> 01:08:29,891
Spec,
I'll bet it would turn up in almost 

1221
01:08:29,891 --> 01:08:29,891
everything.
What is.

1222
01:08:29,891 --> 01:08:34,780
Which is hilarious.
Grass that's toxic to sheep because of 

1223
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:34,780
DMT.
Yup.

1224
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,500
That's the one.
So the DMT in it for whatever reason,

1225
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,320
way it interacts with the sheeps 
digestive system becomes poisoned the.

1226
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:43,970
Well,
no,

1227
01:08:43,971 --> 01:08:46,140
not entirely.
I mean it's got flares.

1228
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:50,270
Grass has dmt.
It has five methoxy DMT,

1229
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:54,530
other tryptamines.
It also has something called grameen,

1230
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:59,740
which has a.
it's like dmt with only one carbon on 

1231
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,280
the side chain.
Grameen is more or less toxic.

1232
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:04,370
Graming shows up in a lot of grass 
species.

1233
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,930
That's probably the thing that causes 
what's called Polaris staggers.

1234
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:14,080
So if you just fed dmt a synthesized to 
sheep,

1235
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:18,050
it wouldn't be toxic.
Hard to say.

1236
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,610
Did they produce monoamine oxidase?

1237
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,770
Nobody's done it to shape.
Yeah,

1238
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:25,730
of course.
So do leopards or jaguars all mammals.

1239
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:30,760
So when you see those jaguars eating the
leaves and then tripping their balls 

1240
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,130
off,
rolling around on their back,

1241
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:34,940
what do you think is happening there?
You've seen those videos.

1242
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,950
I've seen those videos.
Well,

1243
01:09:36,951 --> 01:09:40,960
for one thing,
they were eating a banisteriopsis right?

1244
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,480
Which is the source of the Mao 
inhibitors.

1245
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,630
Right?
And I don't know what to make of that.

1246
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:51,020
It certainly does seem like some kind of
a catnip for them,

1247
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:56,110
you know,
and causes an altered state for Mao 

1248
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,020
inhibitors in,
in an of themselves.

1249
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,480
They produce some sort of a psychedelic 
experience.

1250
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,920
Uh,
they can,

1251
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:05,240
um,
not just from the Mao inhibition,

1252
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:08,480
but they often have other effects that 
are psychoactive,

1253
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:11,000
like harm.
Harming Armenia is a good example.

1254
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:16,540
You know,
we used to think that harming was 

1255
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,940
basically,
it's the Mao inhibitor and Iowasca that 

1256
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:19,100
doesn't do a whole lot beyond that.

1257
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:22,130
Well,
it turns out now harming this,

1258
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:26,960
getting a second look.
It's interesting that the tar mean,

1259
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,550
uh,
you know,

1260
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:33,551
was discovered in [inaudible] about 
maybe 10 years before Iowasca was ever 

1261
01:10:35,391 --> 01:10:40,391
reported to science.
So harming is one of these hoary old 

1262
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:40,760
alkaloids,
I like to call it,

1263
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:46,300
you know,
it's been known forever and now we're 

1264
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,030
just finding out it has all sorts of 
interesting pharmacology.

1265
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:51,680
It's an Mao inhibitor for sure.
More importantly,

1266
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:56,681
it appears that it stimulates 
neurogenesis and that's relevant to 

1267
01:10:56,681 --> 01:11:00,710
Alzheimer's and brain development.
And even down syndrome.

1268
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:05,770
It is an inhibitor of this kinase,
this regulatory protein called Dyr k 

1269
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:12,161
one,
which has got its fingers in lots of 

1270
01:11:12,161 --> 01:11:14,190
different cellular pies.
You could pull it many different

1271
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,720
regulatory functions.
And harming is a very potent,

1272
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:23,721
very selective inhibitor of this kinase.
So that's relates to this.

1273
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,580
It actually stimulates nerve growth in 
the hippocampus.

1274
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,350
So,
uh,

1275
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,920
you know,
we're at and we're finding out that 

1276
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,920
there are a number of other receptors 
that it interacts with,

1277
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:40,170
including Serotonin,
dopamine,

1278
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:45,171
transporters,
even one called the imaginal iin 

1279
01:11:45,171 --> 01:11:46,140
receptors that are,
uh,

1280
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,720
you know,
have undefined functions.

1281
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:53,580
So like most natural molecules,
it's not a one trick pony,

1282
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:58,470
you know,
harming has a number of effects,

1283
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:03,620
you know,
and that's why taking Iowasca is a 

1284
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:03,990
different,
you know,

1285
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:09,080
it.
That's why it's not a pure dmt 

1286
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,860
experience because you've got a whole 
mixture of alkaloids that are,

1287
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:16,220
that are contributing to that effect.
Who were the researchers that when they 

1288
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,661
discovered harming,
they didn't know what it was and they 

1289
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:22,410
tried to label it telepathy to.
They realized that it was harming,

1290
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:22,970
right?

1291
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:23,940
Right.
Well,

1292
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,420
yeah,
this is part of the,

1293
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:31,060
uh,
what you may call the,

1294
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,670
the,
the,

1295
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:36,700
the sad and sorted history of the,
of Iowasca in a certain way because in 

1296
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:43,881
the early days,
in the twenties when people are looking 

1297
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:47,580
at it,
I'm a number of independent groups.

1298
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:50,280
We're working on it.
And they were identified,

1299
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:55,310
they were isolated molecules.
They weren't aware of other people's 

1300
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,550
work.
And so they misnamed these things,

1301
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:57,420
you know,
I mean,

1302
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:59,790
uh,
I can't tell you exactly.

1303
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:05,390
I think initially it was Lewis Lewis who
discovered a harming and he called it 

1304
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,840
business history.
And then it turned out,

1305
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:15,020
well,
another group years before had isolated 

1306
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,021
the same molecule from Ghanim hormonally
and telepathy was one of these 

1307
01:13:18,021 --> 01:13:19,230
misnomers,
you know,

1308
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:20,520
that,
that came out.

1309
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
The problem with,
with this was that back in the day 

1310
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,810
people didn't collect voucher specimens.
So a lot of this chemical work was done 

1311
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:33,000
without the benefit of or barium 
specimens,

1312
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:38,001
which now every everybody that wants to 
do fido chemical work hopefully has the 

1313
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:44,880
good sense to collect specimens of the 
original plant so that people can go 

1314
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:50,121
back and look at that.
A lot of this early work was reported 

1315
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:54,080
and there was no voucher specimens to 
document the collection.

1316
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:57,900
So a lot of it had to be dismissed,
you know,

1317
01:13:57,950 --> 01:14:02,950
uh,
they can the Beta carbon chemistry of 

1318
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:06,880
abs,
three opsis didn't really get 

1319
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:06,880
well-defined until,
um,

1320
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,770
some Chinese scientists,
uh,

1321
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,980
or at least they had Chinese name worked
on them

1322
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:17,590
and discovered harming,
tetra hydro harming and the [inaudible] 

1323
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:21,540
as the main alkaloids.
They could reference that to botanical 

1324
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,040
voucher specimens.
So they really should get the credit for

1325
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:27,190
discovering it.
And then once that was done,

1326
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:32,191
then it was known and you know,
other scientists had to acknowledge 

1327
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:37,471
that,
why did they describe it as telepathy 

1328
01:14:37,471 --> 01:14:40,291
and that there was supposedly some sort 
of a story about some group telepathic 

1329
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:42,220
experience.
This was just romantic.

1330
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:44,560
This was just some story,
you know,

1331
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:47,770
out of the literature.
Um,

1332
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,540
yeah.
I mean,

1333
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:54,620
I mean it,
it was rumored to be able to cause 

1334
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:54,620
telepathy,
but this wasn't Iowasca.

1335
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:58,720
They were only taking hormones.
It's not clear.

1336
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:00,250
It's not clear.
It's not clear.

1337
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,240
Yeah.
I mean,

1338
01:15:01,241 --> 01:15:03,820
they may have been taken,
but they may have been taking it,

1339
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,530
but whether they were getting telepathy,
I kind of doubt it when we know we could

1340
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:10,210
get telepathy on Iowasca.

1341
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:13,210
It's not so uncommon.
It happens all the time.

1342
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:16,890
People have group hallucinations,
group visions.

1343
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:20,140
Has anybody ever bothered to 
independently,

1344
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:24,250
like sequester people,
put them into different rooms,

1345
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:29,490
have them do Iowaska and then have them 
describe a very similar experience are 

1346
01:15:30,011 --> 01:15:34,810
almost identical experience to prove 
that these telepath he experiences exist

1347
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:37,780
or at least to.
As far as I know,

1348
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:39,990
that hasn't been the same.
Yeah,

1349
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,530
because everybody wants to talk 
afterwards.

1350
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,420
I just see the dragon.
I don't think that's been done.

1351
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,870
That seems like a worthy study because 
if.

1352
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,910
If I've heard from more than one person.
In fact my friend Kyle Kingsbury and his

1353
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:59,911
wife had an ios experience with a both a
had a visualization of their child and 

1354
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:06,430
then when they got back she was pregnant
and they wound up having this child from

1355
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:08,800
their visualization from,
from,

1356
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:13,980
from this experience.
Obviously they're very close and they 

1357
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:18,691
were together and they probably 
communicated quite a bit and I would 

1358
01:16:18,691 --> 01:16:19,480
just think it would be a really 
interesting experiment.

1359
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:22,390
It would be very interesting.
I mean,

1360
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:28,030
and that sort of points out there is a 
realm of experience,

1361
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:33,031
a realm of knowing that these things 
give access to that's normally close to 

1362
01:16:34,181 --> 01:16:34,600
us.
I mean,

1363
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,880
it's kind of a trivial statement of 
course.

1364
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:42,320
Um,
but then you get down to questions of 

1365
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,840
how verifiable is that,
how real is that?

1366
01:16:43,841 --> 01:16:45,370
How,
uh,

1367
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,500
you know,
and,

1368
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:51,580
and people get a,
I don't know if the term is hung up,

1369
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,850
but they can get baffled when you start 
talking about,

1370
01:16:56,650 --> 01:17:01,650
you know,
the reality of say the entities you 

1371
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:01,960
encounter on dmt.
I mean this is,

1372
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:06,970
this is some people I know are obsessed 
with trying to verify the reality of the

1373
01:17:08,021 --> 01:17:10,280
entities that find on dmt.

1374
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:17,070
And again,
it comes down to if you experienced 

1375
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:17,070
them,
they're real.

1376
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:20,080
If anything you experienced is real 
because you've experienced it,

1377
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:25,410
does it have a corresponding existence 
in the external world?

1378
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:27,960
Well,
you know,

1379
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,000
what's external?
What's eating turtle?

1380
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:31,220
You know,
we,

1381
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:33,300
we,
we throw around these terms,

1382
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:36,930
these,
these epistomological metaphysical terms

1383
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:39,110
quite carelessly,
you know,

1384
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,660
without really thinking about it.
What does it mean when you say,

1385
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,290
I'm in here and you're out there.
You know,

1386
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:50,280
and then you take a psychedelic and you 
realize that's an artificial boundary.

1387
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,410
You know,
we're all one.

1388
01:17:52,411 --> 01:17:57,411
There is no separation.
It's separate in normal consciousness 

1389
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:57,690
though it's separated in normal 
conscious,

1390
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:02,220
but then what is normal conscious if not
a reflection of year,

1391
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,860
neurochemical brain,
state.

1392
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,920
I mean everything you experience is an 
altered state because it's filtered into

1393
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:14,291
this brain,
processed by the brain and you know the 

1394
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:16,940
brain is a biochemical engine that you 
know,

1395
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:19,400
as I say,
often were made out of drug,

1396
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:24,490
so it seems that our normal 
consciousness is the best state to 

1397
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:27,450
propagate biological life and to keep 
our,

1398
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:32,750
our whatever we've created in terms of 
our community structures and 

1399
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,800
relationships and friendships and the 
ability to build structures and houses 

1400
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,240
and things like that.
These,

1401
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:41,360
all of these things are done best when 
you're here and present.

1402
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,880
Whereas when you're on a psychedelic 
state,

1403
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,320
I agree with you.
Well,

1404
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:50,360
the way I've always described it as if 
you had a meeting with God and you went 

1405
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,110
and God gave you all the answers to the 
world and you,

1406
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:58,130
you experienced a undeniable beauty in 
the most extreme form possible where you

1407
01:18:59,471 --> 01:19:04,471
couldn't have imagined it and then you 
came back whether you hallucinated it or

1408
01:19:04,511 --> 01:19:06,940
not,
it's the exact same experience.

1409
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:09,630
Exactly.
I can't put it on a scale right away.

1410
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:14,640
It was like we've stretched the tape 
measure around and God is 47 inches 

1411
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,000
across.
Like just because,

1412
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:21,210
you know what I'm saying?
Just because you can't measure it with 

1413
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:21,440
what we term our,
our,

1414
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,260
our,
you know,

1415
01:19:22,261 --> 01:19:25,640
our metrics for reality.
Right?

1416
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:28,280
And that is exactly the thing.

1417
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,010
Don't worry about whether it's real and 
the way we would define real.

1418
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:36,410
Is it good information or is it bad or 
is it not?

1419
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,920
That's the thing.
It doesn't matter where it comes from,

1420
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,960
it's such a fits good information.
Then it has its own internal validity of

1421
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:49,691
whether it came from some part of 
yourself that is normally obscurity you 

1422
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:51,330
or,
uh,

1423
01:19:51,331 --> 01:19:55,620
came from the plant teacher or the 
aliens transmitting it through.

1424
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:01,320
It doesn't really matter,
but we we're obsessed with that reality 

1425
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,100
because we think we're being fooled a 
lot.

1426
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:08,400
Right?
Like in this goes back to terrance's La 

1427
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,960
Chorrera psychedelic,
where he had a Ufo encounter.

1428
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:10,840
You know,
the,

1429
01:20:10,841 --> 01:20:13,800
the easily dismissing amongst us will 
go,

1430
01:20:13,801 --> 01:20:18,801
well,
he's tripping his balls off on 

1431
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:18,801
mushrooms.
Of course I saw you was,

1432
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:20,910
or a leprechaun drive in the UFO.
Like all that's nonsense,

1433
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:21,870
right?

1434
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:27,950
Be Easy to dismiss as in fact,
that is the nature of these phenomena.

1435
01:20:28,311 --> 01:20:32,580
That's what's really interesting.
Easy to dismiss that.

1436
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:35,940
That was another aspect of the 
experiment of La Truro.

1437
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:38,170
I left out when I was talking about my 
lecture,

1438
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:43,171
but there's almost always an element of 
absurdity in these experiences and in 

1439
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:49,030
paranormal experiences,
in Ufo encounters.

1440
01:20:49,031 --> 01:20:52,830
It's like little green men bond,
are you kidding?

1441
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:57,890
But the fuck there are little green man 
and little blue man.

1442
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:01,470
You know a guy who should have on the 
show.

1443
01:21:01,471 --> 01:21:04,650
Maybe you have already a is Whitley 
strieber?

1444
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,080
No,
I haven't had him on,

1445
01:21:06,081 --> 01:21:10,640
but he's so out to lunch.
I have massive reservations.

1446
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:14,830
There's a video of him looking at a fly 
in fly.

1447
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:19,400
Clearly a fly flies in front of a camera
and he's describing it.

1448
01:21:19,401 --> 01:21:24,401
Is this a man in a suit?
And it's like there's something wrong 

1449
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:24,401
with them.

1450
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,550
Well,
I missed that.

1451
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,640
I missed that part.
I think what's interesting about 

1452
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:31,640
Whitley,
and I agree,

1453
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,450
I totally dismissed him,
you know,

1454
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:35,040
for a long time.
I thought,

1455
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:37,580
you know,
he is really a nutcase.

1456
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:41,220
He's from the communion books or people 
that don't know exactly what a series of

1457
01:21:41,221 --> 01:21:43,560
books about being abducted and.

1458
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:48,870
Yeah,
but I sort of had to change my opinion 

1459
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:52,880
somewhat because he and uh,
and uh,

1460
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:57,980
Jeffrey cripple,
who I do know is Jeffrey Carpool is a 

1461
01:21:58,711 --> 01:22:03,711
professor of comparative religion and 
mythology at Rice university and his 

1462
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:09,471
focus initially as a sort of the,
the superhero,

1463
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:14,541
as,
as in contemporary mythology as a 

1464
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:17,460
mythical figure in that sort of thing.
He.

1465
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:21,330
And uh,
I was invited to a,

1466
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:27,360
a simple,
a workshop that Whitley was going to be 

1467
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,231
at.
This was a couple of years ago in 

1468
01:22:31,231 --> 01:22:34,021
Hawaii.
While I'm always interested in a free 

1469
01:22:34,021 --> 01:22:34,021
trip to Hawaii.
Right?

1470
01:22:34,021 --> 01:22:34,021
So I said,
I,

1471
01:22:34,021 --> 01:22:35,310
you know,
I'd like to come to this thing,

1472
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:40,311
but this guy is a nut case,
I'm not sure I want to appear on the 

1473
01:22:40,311 --> 01:22:41,860
same stage with this guy and if it's me 
saying that,

1474
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:46,650
you know,
and uh,

1475
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:49,630
you know,
and the guy who was hosting it said,

1476
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:51,170
well,
you know,

1477
01:22:51,171 --> 01:22:54,250
did you know that he and Jeffrey Carpal 
wrote a book together?

1478
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,120
And I said,
Whoa,

1479
01:22:55,121 --> 01:22:55,980
I don't.
I said that.

1480
01:22:55,981 --> 01:22:58,920
I know Jeffrey cripple.
I know that he's not on that case.

1481
01:22:58,921 --> 01:23:03,921
And that's interesting.
And then I found out about the book and 

1482
01:23:03,921 --> 01:23:04,370
I said,
I,

1483
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:08,710
I told the guy,
if you invite Geoffrey and Whitley,

1484
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:13,740
then all come and will participate.
The name of the book is a supernatural 

1485
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:17,050
two words,
supernatural,

1486
01:23:17,051 --> 01:23:22,051
a new vision of the unexplained.
And it's really very interesting.

1487
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,290
Um,
the book is basically,

1488
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:30,190
you know,
alternating chapters.

1489
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:35,220
Whitley tells us stories about what 
happened to it and what has happened to 

1490
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:39,541
and what continues to happen to him.
He lives in some kind of alternate 

1491
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:39,541
reality.
I,

1492
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:39,670
I,
t,

1493
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,810
I get that.
I mean,

1494
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:42,550
I don't know if I accept it,
but I get it.

1495
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:47,970
And then in alternating chapters,
Jeffrey comes along and kind of unpacks 

1496
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:51,390
this and explained where does this fit 
into sort of the,

1497
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:56,590
the phenomenology of mythology and,
you know,

1498
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:01,620
reasonable explanations and uh,
and it's a fascinating book.

1499
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:05,200
If you just suspend disbelief for a 
minute,

1500
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:10,000
think about,
assume that Whitley's is sincere.

1501
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:15,001
I don't think he's lying.
I think that these things really 

1502
01:24:15,001 --> 01:24:18,211
happened to him or he thinks they do and
some of the most craziest things,

1503
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:20,700
these are not,
you know,

1504
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:25,300
the media has made like everything,
they dumb it down,

1505
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:25,900
you know,
and they,

1506
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:29,930
they put it into the box of alien 
encounters guys,

1507
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:31,800
a nutball,
uh,

1508
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:33,070
you know,
and they dismiss it.

1509
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:38,130
But if you take a closer look,
one thing to Whitley's credit is he 

1510
01:24:38,711 --> 01:24:40,870
doesn't claim to understand what's 
happening.

1511
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,110
He doesn't call it an alien encounter.
He doesn't claim anything.

1512
01:24:44,111 --> 01:24:49,111
He just says this is happening.
I have no frigging idea what is,

1513
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,400
what this is.
So that's honest,

1514
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:55,930
you know,
that's an honest scientific stance.

1515
01:24:55,931 --> 01:25:00,931
I do not understand this phenomenon.
So I gave him credit for that and then 

1516
01:25:00,931 --> 01:25:03,490
he and,
and Jeffrey wrote this book.

1517
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,730
There was a very interesting,
uh,

1518
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:07,930
you know,
later on.

1519
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,960
So I read all this later on in the book.
There's a chapter where they get to what

1520
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:18,391
is the possible physical explanation of 
what's going on here.

1521
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,330
If there is a physical explanation and 
one of the headings,

1522
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:27,331
I think the chapter one of the headings 
and the chapter was labeled the soul as 

1523
01:25:27,371 --> 01:25:31,600
a Ufo.
And that kind of blew my mind.

1524
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:34,840
That got my attention because,
you know,

1525
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:40,380
when I did this workshop with them,
I was kind of bringing the flag of 

1526
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,020
Psychedelics,
right?

1527
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:43,450
That was saying,
if you don't aggress psychedelics,

1528
01:25:43,451 --> 01:25:46,060
you've only got part of the picture 
here.

1529
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:48,190
And uh,
and they,

1530
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:50,320
and they were talking about how the 
soul,

1531
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:56,910
how this could be some sort of a 
physical plaza moist type of thing.

1532
01:25:57,071 --> 01:25:59,830
They were invoking scientific 
terminology.

1533
01:25:59,831 --> 01:26:02,860
I don't know if it was,
it was legitimate or not,

1534
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:05,450
but just the idea of the soul of a Ufo.

1535
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:07,850
And I was able to respond to that and 
say,

1536
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:08,730
well,
you know,

1537
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:13,970
the experiment at launch,
earl was essentially the blueprints of 

1538
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:16,710
how to build one of these things that 
you're talking to,

1539
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,510
which it was really this,
this transformation.

1540
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:25,500
And so that was,
that impressed me.

1541
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:29,100
I don't know what to make of that.
I think.

1542
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:31,950
I think there is and they don't really 
know.

1543
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:37,130
Nobody knows what to make of it,
but I think there just odd things going 

1544
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:38,380
on.
Um,

1545
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:44,380
but that some people experience yes.
And uh,

1546
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:50,060
and whether they are actual encounters 
or dreams or somewhere in between.

1547
01:26:53,230 --> 01:26:56,060
I'm not sure.
It would be cool.

1548
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:57,890
It would be good.
I mean,

1549
01:26:58,570 --> 01:26:59,410
yeah.
I don't know.

1550
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,010
I mean,
when you,

1551
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,410
when you,
when you meet Whitley,

1552
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,660
have you ever met him?
No,

1553
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:10,590
he is like the most drab person you 
could imagine.

1554
01:27:10,631 --> 01:27:12,430
I mean he's like an accountant or 
something

1555
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:14,260
probably worn out from telling all these
stories.

1556
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,510
Could be,
could be.

1557
01:27:16,511 --> 01:27:19,120
But he was.
But he was a fiction writer.

1558
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:24,390
He was a fiction writer.
And then he comes out with this 

1559
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:27,810
incredible real world story reads like 
fiction and I.

1560
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:32,820
There's obviously something off when you
talk to him or you hear him and I've 

1561
01:27:32,921 --> 01:27:37,921
never talked to him personally,
but when you see him in interviews and 

1562
01:27:37,921 --> 01:27:39,040
conversations,
there's something off now.

1563
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:41,860
What is that something off?
Is it a psychotic break?

1564
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:44,370
Is it something that drifts in and out?
Does he,

1565
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,260
is he having problems with normal 
consciousness?

1566
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:48,100
I mean,
I don't,

1567
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:50,990
I don't know what it is,
but I thought I'm really,

1568
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,800
if you can find that video of him 
talking about the fly.

1569
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:59,040
Did you find it flies a man in a fucking
space suit.

1570
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:00,640
He's like,
it's not a man in a suit.

1571
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,480
What is that?
And I'm like,

1572
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:06,510
oh Jesus.
To the lunch called the Ben with quite a

1573
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:12,390
few of those.
There's quite a few really bizarre 

1574
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:14,170
videos of him when he's having a hard 
time with normal reality.

1575
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:19,380
So which would make sense during the 
dream state because all of these things 

1576
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:19,380
are happening at night.
Right,

1577
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:20,090
right,
right.

1578
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:23,170
This was the,
this is the big thing that I've always.

1579
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,650
Big Problem I've always had about these 
UFO abduction experiences.

1580
01:28:26,651 --> 01:28:31,651
First of all,
they all take place when someone is 

1581
01:28:31,651 --> 01:28:34,510
either a at night,
it's either they're on a dark road where

1582
01:28:34,511 --> 01:28:39,511
there's no one around and they're sleepy
or they're at home and their bed like 

1583
01:28:39,511 --> 01:28:42,790
the vast majority of them take place at 
night or while someone's lying in bed,

1584
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:48,060
which is exactly when you're dreaming.
Now we don't totally understand the 

1585
01:28:48,131 --> 01:28:50,350
dream state,
but we there's,

1586
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:55,770
there's a connection,
at least an implied connection between 

1587
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:58,981
psychedelic chemicals that your brain 
produces endogenously that could be 

1588
01:28:58,981 --> 01:29:01,350
released during the dream state and in 
different levels with different humans.

1589
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:06,350
I mean obviously some people have 
problems with producing serotonin and 

1590
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:09,300
dopamine and then other people have no 
problems with it and this biology of the

1591
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:10,890
human brain varies,
right?

1592
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:16,340
So it's not without consider it or not 
without possibility that there's someone

1593
01:29:17,761 --> 01:29:22,761
who has a real issue with these 
chemicals just bust in through right 

1594
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,170
flooding there.
Are we,

1595
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,100
oh wait,
no,

1596
01:29:26,101 --> 01:29:29,030
there aren't people then does this 
mental illness,

1597
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:34,910
but then does this contradict what we've
already said about psychedelic 

1598
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:38,121
experiences?
Like why would we diminish his 

1599
01:29:38,121 --> 01:29:38,760
indogenous psychedelic experience if 
that's what he's having.

1600
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:44,060
I mean,
it is entirely possible that you're 

1601
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:44,060
dealing with someone who maybe perhaps 
does have some sort of psychotic breaks,

1602
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:49,250
but also is experiencing psychedelic 
experiences due to some endogenous DMT 

1603
01:29:49,711 --> 01:29:53,190
dump or dump of whatever.
And all these things are taking place at

1604
01:29:53,191 --> 01:29:56,460
the same time in the dream state during 
heavy rem sleep.

1605
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:00,870
And he's coming back with these uniform 
stories of alien abduction.

1606
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,430
Yeah,
no,

1607
01:30:02,431 --> 01:30:03,270
I agree.
It's,

1608
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,970
it's.
I mean it's hard to

1609
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:10,300
Parse it out.
I'm not saying I accept it all,

1610
01:30:10,301 --> 01:30:12,550
but I,
it's easy to dismiss,

1611
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:16,300
but maybe you shouldn't write.
Well there may be something there.

1612
01:30:16,301 --> 01:30:21,301
We should approach it in the spirit of 
here's a phenomenon.

1613
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:25,290
We don't understand that we shouldn't 
dismiss it.

1614
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:29,670
There's something to be understood here.
Not necessarily his understanding of it,

1615
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:35,030
but something to be looked at there.
And I thought this book was interesting 

1616
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:35,820
for its balanced.
You know,

1617
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:40,490
I would not have Whitley strieber on 
your show without Jeffrey cry a lot.

1618
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,930
So that was the thing.
Cause he,

1619
01:30:42,931 --> 01:30:43,800
it would be fun

1620
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:46,540
and maybe it's,
you know,

1621
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,890
maybe it's a bridge too far.
I'm not.

1622
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:52,510
Yeah,
maybe that maybe we get to the bottom of

1623
01:30:52,511 --> 01:30:53,410
this thing.
Yeah.

1624
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:58,710
Well,
is there something to be got to the 

1625
01:30:58,710 --> 01:30:58,710
bottom right?
That's,

1626
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:02,330
that's the bottom of this is just one 
man's delusion or is there really 

1627
01:31:02,471 --> 01:31:03,820
something that.
The base of it,

1628
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:09,140
and this is the,
this is kind of the point that we were 

1629
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:13,111
talking about a while back and this 
conversation about natural philosophy,

1630
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:18,420
natural philosophy,
you know,

1631
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:22,800
it has a wider scope for understanding 
and you can say,

1632
01:31:22,801 --> 01:31:27,801
well,
you meaning natural philosophy will 

1633
01:31:27,801 --> 01:31:29,160
accept every Kaka may mean woo idea that
ever came along.

1634
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,500
Not Properly.
I mean,

1635
01:31:31,501 --> 01:31:34,650
it's natural philosophy.
Properly approached,

1636
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:40,010
should be a way to evaluate these things
rigorously,

1637
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,390
not abandoned,
rigorous thought,

1638
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:47,420
but not be so dismissive of it as to say
it doesn't fit into our paradigm.

1639
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:49,800
It doesn't fit into what we think we 
know.

1640
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:53,040
So we're not going to talk about.
That's dishonest.

1641
01:31:53,041 --> 01:31:56,030
That's intellectual dishonesty.
And uh,

1642
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:58,530
we have too much of that.
You know,

1643
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:05,110
sciences are very timid.
I'm kind of activity sometimes because 

1644
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:11,450
in its current,
in its current incarnation,

1645
01:32:11,451 --> 01:32:12,800
it's so depend,
it's,

1646
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:17,830
it's corrupted in a certain way.
You can't just be the curious monkey 

1647
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:21,410
who's trying to apply,
you know,

1648
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:27,110
clear thinking,
rigorous thought to understanding 

1649
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:27,110
nature.
We don't have that.

1650
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,470
Luxury scientists don't have that 
luxury.

1651
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:31,350
If they're practicing scientists,
you have to be getting grants,

1652
01:32:31,351 --> 01:32:34,080
you have to play the science game.

1653
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:36,850
So that's what he keeps saying sciences 
corrupted.

1654
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:38,860
That's what you mean by that.
They have to get grants.

1655
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,600
Not that they have to,
that's part of it.

1656
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:43,610
They,
they have to get grants and they have to

1657
01:32:43,611 --> 01:32:45,410
be dishonest.
Right?

1658
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,140
I mean with themselves,
with what they know,

1659
01:32:48,141 --> 01:32:53,141
like the example of the archeologists or
the psychedelic researchers back in the 

1660
01:32:53,141 --> 01:32:55,970
80.
If you want to kill your career,

1661
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:59,150
tell your supervisor that you wanted to 
work on psychedelics.

1662
01:32:59,151 --> 01:33:04,151
You were pretty much done.
Or if you were an archeologist and you 

1663
01:33:04,151 --> 01:33:04,151
said,
but,

1664
01:33:04,151 --> 01:33:04,610
but,
but you know,

1665
01:33:04,611 --> 01:33:09,611
look,
there's all this evidence for ancient 

1666
01:33:09,611 --> 01:33:12,671
civilizations.
It's like you want to be in this 

1667
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:12,671
department,
kid,

1668
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:13,730
you're outta here.
If you start talking about that.

1669
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:18,800
So science is dogma in a lot of ways.
Not always,

1670
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:24,310
but it's unfortunate that no,
in order to save people's careers,

1671
01:33:27,151 --> 01:33:31,520
in order to have a career in science,
you have to make the sacrifice.

1672
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:36,550
You have to,
you have to keep to yourself things you 

1673
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:40,851
know to be true.
You know that you can't really talk 

1674
01:33:40,851 --> 01:33:43,410
about because your colleagues will look 
askance at you and sciences.

1675
01:33:43,411 --> 01:33:46,530
A very medieval institution in that 
respect.

1676
01:33:46,531 --> 01:33:49,110
It's a lot like religion.
You know,

1677
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:54,710
when you look at the DMT experience and 
you look at its effect on the human 

1678
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:57,030
mind,
how much have you subscribes to.

1679
01:33:57,031 --> 01:33:59,970
The idea that we're looking at is some 
sort of a chemical gateway,

1680
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:06,300
chemical gateway to what,
whatever it is to whatever that dmt 

1681
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:10,210
experiences that this is something that 
your brain has the ability to travel to.

1682
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:14,170
But I mean when we,
since we know that the body does produce

1683
01:34:14,171 --> 01:34:19,171
this and we know that possible for 
people to.

1684
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:22,320
Yeah,
I mean I've never done it,

1685
01:34:22,321 --> 01:34:27,321
but I know that people who do Kundalini 
Yoga have apparently reported trip,

1686
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:30,740
like experiences that are very similar 
to a real dmt flash.

1687
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:33,710
So the mind has this ability to do this 
on its own.

1688
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:37,640
What do you think that that,
is that something worth considering that

1689
01:34:37,641 --> 01:34:42,641
this is,
this is some sort of a pathway to a 

1690
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:44,390
nearby dimension or the to something 
that's around us all the time,

1691
01:34:44,391 --> 01:34:47,660
but we just don't have access to with 
normal neurochemistry

1692
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,670
all there are too many what ifs or who 
knows?

1693
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:52,920
I mean there's,
you know,

1694
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:58,010
there's so much in what you said where 
you have to go

1695
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:03,010
back and unpack all of these things.
When we got excited about dmt terence 

1696
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:07,550
than me in the early,
in the late sixties,

1697
01:35:07,551 --> 01:35:12,551
what led is to go to La Chorrera was 
that it seemed like a completely 

1698
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:17,900
different order of magnitude than any of
the other psychedelics.

1699
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:23,410
And we came to it really from a 
childhood that was steeped in science 

1700
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:24,530
fiction.
So we carried with the,

1701
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:29,770
with us the idea,
this really is another dimension and it 

1702
01:35:30,051 --> 01:35:34,520
may be a portal to another dimension.
And as science fiction nuts,

1703
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:37,550
we were totally okay with that.
Yeah.

1704
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:40,940
And we thought maybe DMT was.
And maybe it is,

1705
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:46,360
but,
or it's somehow pulls the curtain back 

1706
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:50,180
on something that's around us all the 
time that we don't see.

1707
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:52,210
Um,
but again,

1708
01:35:52,211 --> 01:35:57,211
in thinking about these things,
is it something that is entirely within 

1709
01:35:57,211 --> 01:35:59,630
the brain that it originates?
Or is it something that,

1710
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:04,800
is it like a lens that you know,
or our eyes are covered with,

1711
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,430
with,
uh,

1712
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:10,100
with filters and DMT temporarily removes
those filters?

1713
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,540
I think it's hard to know.
I mean,

1714
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:16,220
I think maybe experimentally we could,
we could begin to approach this.

1715
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,320
Have you,
you know,

1716
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,300
am I,
I think we really know.

1717
01:36:20,301 --> 01:36:23,900
I think that's another thing about 
natural philosophy,

1718
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:29,820
um,
that's important that science is 

1719
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:33,551
overlooking and natural philosophy 
always remembers the limits of what is 

1720
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:35,510
known,
you know,

1721
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:39,140
and sciences a bit arrogant about what 
they think is known.

1722
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:41,300
You know,
they only have,

1723
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:45,230
science only understands a small 
fraction of all there is to know.

1724
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:50,780
And Iowasca another psychedelic always 
remind me of this when I take it.

1725
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:55,640
Remember the limitations of your 
knowledge or sometimes it's more or less

1726
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:58,010
kindly says it.
You don't know shit.

1727
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,820
And it's true.
We don't know.

1728
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:03,290
You know,
and scientists can forget that,

1729
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:07,760
you know,
but as far as this dmt a thing,

1730
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:10,620
you know,
this is actually a,

1731
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:13,670
there's controversy about this because,
uh,

1732
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:16,730
you know,
um,

1733
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:21,970
a lot of,
a lot of people who have worked in this 

1734
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:25,661
area say it's,
it's pretty well established that 

1735
01:37:25,661 --> 01:37:28,180
endogenous dmt can produce these states,
that the neil can secrete dmt under 

1736
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:35,711
certain circumstances or under stress.
The lungs can produce large amounts of 

1737
01:37:35,711 --> 01:37:39,570
dmt that are translocated to the brain.
Um,

1738
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:44,120
but it's not so clear that that goes on.
I mean,

1739
01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:47,540
it's clear that it can be produced.
But David Nichols,

1740
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:53,170
you know,
who knows a thing or two about 

1741
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:54,770
pharmacology,
founder of the heffter institute worlds,

1742
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:55,950
you know,

1743
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:01,010
most authoritative,
highest authority when it comes to the 

1744
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:04,590
chemistry and pharmacology of,
of psychedelics.

1745
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:10,430
He's,
he's taken the reductionist argument on 

1746
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:11,940
this that's kind of hard to,
uh,

1747
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:17,660
to knock down,
which is that DMT is produced 

1748
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:21,621
endogenously,
but it's chopped up so quickly that it 

1749
01:38:21,621 --> 01:38:26,241
never reaches the site of action and it 
never reaches the levels at the neuron 

1750
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,720
that it would take to activate the 
neurons.

1751
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:32,380
Um,
you know,

1752
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:37,490
so we only consumed or are you saying 
endogenously produced the endogenously 

1753
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,380
so that it does,
when you consume it,

1754
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:45,470
obviously you flood the system and 
you'll get much higher levels than has 

1755
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:49,941
ever produced endogenously and I,
but we haven't really measured the 

1756
01:38:49,941 --> 01:38:53,220
levels produced endogenously during,
especially these extreme states.

1757
01:38:53,221 --> 01:38:55,800
And that's part of the problem.
That's part of the problem.

1758
01:38:55,801 --> 01:38:57,510
How do you do that?
Have you done,

1759
01:38:57,511 --> 01:38:58,830
do you do that?
What?

1760
01:38:58,831 --> 01:39:01,110
Have you done Kundalini and tried to 
recreate?

1761
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:03,540
No,
I haven't either.

1762
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,900
I've met terrence had that fantastic 
joke.

1763
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:11,890
Uh,
it was a talk about that this monk had a

1764
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,560
practice,
the city of levitation.

1765
01:39:13,561 --> 01:39:15,290
Do you remember this one?
And uh,

1766
01:39:15,291 --> 01:39:20,291
that uh,
the Buddha came to town and he said for 

1767
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:21,810
the last 20 years I've practiced the 
city of levitation and I can now walk on

1768
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:23,280
water.
And the Buddhist said,

1769
01:39:23,281 --> 01:39:25,080
yeah,
but the ferries only a nickel.

1770
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:32,560
It's like you want to practice Kundalini
for 10 years and Bang your head towards 

1771
01:39:33,151 --> 01:39:38,151
the east or just smoked dmt and 30 
seconds later I run a center of the 

1772
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:43,431
universe.
But I think the last time I was on your 

1773
01:39:43,431 --> 01:39:43,431
show,
we talked about this,

1774
01:39:43,431 --> 01:39:43,431
uh,
this other thing,

1775
01:39:43,431 --> 01:39:46,320
this agile light we discussed.
Yes.

1776
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:48,900
And I don't know if you've interviewed.
Yeah,

1777
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:50,690
we have to buy you one.
I said we were,

1778
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:53,520
we totally dropped the ball on that.
You don't have to buy.

1779
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:58,550
No,
we do have to buy you want by yourself 

1780
01:39:58,550 --> 01:39:58,620
while I'm going to buy myself one menu 
and this time we're going to do it.

1781
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:00,960
We said we're going to do too many 
podcasts.

1782
01:40:00,961 --> 01:40:02,790
I forget everything.
I know I,

1783
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:07,710
I've never bought that.
Agilent is interesting because,

1784
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:13,580
you know,
I mean he claims and that was the 

1785
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:13,580
conversation we had.
He claimed,

1786
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:18,471
yes,
this stimulates and dodges synthesis of 

1787
01:40:18,471 --> 01:40:19,900
writing this down.
Right now it's a j.

1788
01:40:19,930 --> 01:40:24,450
A n a homage,
no light.

1789
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:28,620
And his website is just [inaudible] dot 
com.

1790
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,800
And there's some good pdfs on there 
that'll explain what this is about.

1791
01:40:34,990 --> 01:40:36,060
That Jamie.
Yeah.

1792
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:40,470
And a big time because I just mentioned 
this,

1793
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:48,090
but anyway,
so this light can produce some sort of 

1794
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:48,180
psych,
no experience.

1795
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,810
He claims it stimulates dmt synthesis in
the pineal.

1796
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:55,870
When you lie underneath that assist,
a bunch of it's,

1797
01:40:55,871 --> 01:40:57,560
it looks like a floor lamp,
you know,

1798
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:02,590
with a rectangular mount bunch of leds 
underneath it,

1799
01:41:02,591 --> 01:41:05,530
which he programs with an ipad and 
different patterns.

1800
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:10,860
You lie under it and you.
It stimulates hypnagogic hallucinations 

1801
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:14,820
that are a lot like that guy looks like 
an old school freak looking at him.

1802
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:18,010
He's a zen monk.
I bet he is.

1803
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:21,010
Amongst other things.
He used to be an apple engineer.

1804
01:41:21,011 --> 01:41:25,900
He was jobs right hand man when wow.
He went the right way.

1805
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,360
He went the right way.
So he's got this thing.

1806
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:32,260
Is that cord going down to her head and 
hard time seeing what's happening.

1807
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:35,170
Something's wrapped around her head.
That better not be a crystal.

1808
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:37,360
I think that running out of this room.
No,

1809
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:41,160
I think that's deceptive thing.
He didn't attach anything to me.

1810
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:46,750
Perspective Issue Court binder.
So you lie under this thing.

1811
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:50,950
And first time I lived under it I 
thought I got all these colors.

1812
01:41:50,951 --> 01:41:53,650
I got all these hypnagogic effects,
you know,

1813
01:41:53,651 --> 01:41:58,651
and nice patterns and all that.
Like a sub threshold DMT experience.

1814
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,730
And I said,
well,

1815
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:01,690
you know,
the,

1816
01:42:01,691 --> 01:42:05,020
uh,
the leds are all changing color,

1817
01:42:05,021 --> 01:42:06,160
right?
And that's how I see it.

1818
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:06,640
He says,
no,

1819
01:42:06,641 --> 01:42:08,980
they're white.
The colors are coming from you.

1820
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:11,980
You're supplying the colors.
So,

1821
01:42:11,981 --> 01:42:14,530
okay.
So it was interesting.

1822
01:42:14,531 --> 01:42:19,330
And then we got into the conversation.
How do you know this is stimulating dmt?

1823
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,040
How do you know that's the effect?

1824
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:25,120
It turns out it's not so easy to nail 
that down,

1825
01:42:26,510 --> 01:42:31,510
you know,
because the empty is sore femoral and 

1826
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:33,820
the system,
you can't take urine samples or cerebral

1827
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:38,380
spinal fluid or anything.
It would be gone by the time you did it.

1828
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:42,370
So the only way,
well maybe not the only way,

1829
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:45,870
but one way you could do it is you could
do something called a,

1830
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:50,470
um,
it's essentially you couldn't do this to

1831
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:51,670
a human [inaudible].
You couldn't,

1832
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:56,730
you couldn't get an FDA approval for it,
but you could put a micro capillary tube

1833
01:42:57,281 --> 01:43:02,281
right next to the pineal that will 
absorb things as they are released.

1834
01:43:03,131 --> 01:43:05,830
And then you could recover that and say,
you know,

1835
01:43:05,831 --> 01:43:09,550
levels of DMT or why couldn't you do 
that to a voluntary participant?

1836
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:14,230
Voluntary or not?
You'd be screwing their brain up.

1837
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:15,190
Well,
no,

1838
01:43:15,191 --> 01:43:20,191
not necessarily,
but you'd have a hard time getting 

1839
01:43:20,191 --> 01:43:20,191
permission.

1840
01:43:20,191 --> 01:43:20,740
There might be.
You could do it to a rat though.

1841
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:26,130
You could do it too.
That's what cottonwood research 

1842
01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:26,130
foundation's done,
right?

1843
01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:30,000
They've done that.
That's how they discovered dmt and the 

1844
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:30,000
pineal,
um,

1845
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:31,230
to a live rat.
Yeah.

1846
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:33,160
Yeah.
That's how they discovered it.

1847
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:35,200
That was the first proof,
right?

1848
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:38,620
That was the first proof.
Nick Cozy,

1849
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:43,700
um,
who's a pharmacologists at the 

1850
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:45,610
University of Wisconsin at Madison.
He was really the first one to show that

1851
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:50,640
DMT is endogenously produced.
It's sigma one agonist as well as a 

1852
01:43:52,461 --> 01:43:54,560
Serotonin agonist,
which is another,

1853
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:57,900
another receptor.
No,

1854
01:43:58,350 --> 01:44:03,020
the definitely that,
but it's not clear what the function is.

1855
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:06,440
It's,
it's a complicated issue,

1856
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:07,700
you know,
um,

1857
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:12,940
to figure this out,
I'll send you a paper that Nicole's 

1858
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:16,290
rotor elite.
I'll link you to a video where he 

1859
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:16,290
discusses this and it's like,
you know,

1860
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:21,250
he gave that at the breaking convention 
conference last summer that I was at and

1861
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:23,500
it was like,
you know,

1862
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:26,290
he was like the big Downer of the 
conference,

1863
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:26,600
right?

1864
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:31,730
Because everybody has this romantic idea
and he comes along and just squashes it,

1865
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:34,200
you know,
and it's like,

1866
01:44:34,410 --> 01:44:35,860
man,
you know,

1867
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:39,690
have disappointed a lot of people.
But on the other hand,

1868
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:42,780
reality is good.
Facts are good.

1869
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:47,200
What a guy did do that,
uh,

1870
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:50,430
uh,
the sort of made me think,

1871
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:53,220
made me think maybe there is something 
to it.

1872
01:44:53,221 --> 01:44:55,260
He's tried,
um,

1873
01:44:56,280 --> 01:45:01,280
pre dosing with an Mao inhibitor.
Just take a stereopsis t without the 

1874
01:45:02,251 --> 01:45:06,540
admixture about 30 minutes before going 
under the light and then the,

1875
01:45:06,541 --> 01:45:09,480
it's much more intense of it's much more
prolonged.

1876
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,340
You've done this.
I haven't done it,

1877
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:16,370
but he claims that have other people say
that it definitely enhances the.

1878
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:21,400
So that would indicate that the 
breakdown of DMT is being

1879
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:27,010
inhibited.
Is he claiming that you could reach 

1880
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:29,060
actual dmt states with this device upon 
practice?

1881
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:31,250
Yeah.
What about in the tank?

1882
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:35,240
Well,
seems designed for the tank,

1883
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:38,510
but how do you,
how do you put the light in the tank?

1884
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:43,540
You just suspended,
suspended from the ceiling and put a 

1885
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:43,900
switch on the wall,
climb in,

1886
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:46,820
hit the switch and lay down.
You could try it.

1887
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,380
I'm going to try it.
You could try it.

1888
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:53,410
That seems like the way I'm going to get
a hold of crash from the float lab 

1889
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:56,680
because crash was trying to put a.
he's the mad scientist behind the float 

1890
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:59,520
lab,
which is the most advanced serum he saw,

1891
01:45:59,521 --> 01:46:04,521
that contraption that we have back there
that is state of the art as it gets in 

1892
01:46:04,521 --> 01:46:08,481
the world of tanks and he had a concept 
for developing learning,

1893
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:11,220
uh,
films,

1894
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:16,050
films where you would lie down and in 
the absence of any physical input,

1895
01:46:16,051 --> 01:46:21,051
right,
or very minimal be meaning that you're 

1896
01:46:21,051 --> 01:46:21,051
floating in that environment.

1897
01:46:21,051 --> 01:46:25,830
He was going to suspend an LCD screen at
the lowest possible light emission.

1898
01:46:26,001 --> 01:46:27,980
So you would not be able to see the 
edges of the screen.

1899
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:32,981
You would just be able to see the images
on the screen and they would play 

1900
01:46:32,981 --> 01:46:34,640
instructional videos and things and you 
would learn them with the minimal amount

1901
01:46:34,641 --> 01:46:36,680
of distractions and you think you could 
achieve.

1902
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:39,740
His thought was that you could achieve 
accelerated learning.

1903
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:40,660
Like,
yeah,

1904
01:46:40,661 --> 01:46:45,661
like perhaps you could work on your golf
swing or something like that or some 

1905
01:46:45,661 --> 01:46:49,960
thing that you could get in there or 
maybe musical instruments that you'd be 

1906
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:51,870
able to pick up concepts and things with
minimal distraction.

1907
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:53,910
Oh,
that's very interesting.

1908
01:46:53,911 --> 01:46:55,230
You have a lot of experience with the 
tank.

1909
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:57,000
Almost none.
Oh,

1910
01:46:57,001 --> 01:46:58,260
it's so great.
You,

1911
01:46:58,310 --> 01:47:03,310
you would love it.
And it's really great for working out 

1912
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:05,721
ideas for one of the best environments 
in the world for working on a,

1913
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:10,290
a thought because there's no input.
You're not thinking about anything else.

1914
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:12,240
You just in total silence,
total darkness,

1915
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:14,970
very relaxing.
You're floating and you,

1916
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,800
you know,
in the absence of this input,

1917
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:19,140
you,
your brain has more resources.

1918
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:22,440
Is it similar to a psychedelic 
experience?

1919
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:23,610
Yes.
Yes,

1920
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,470
you can try it.
It's here.

1921
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:26,720
I mean,
you got,

1922
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:27,880
you got some time.
Is it

1923
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:31,560
actually not today.
I have to go to another interview,

1924
01:47:31,561 --> 01:47:33,210
but,
but um,

1925
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,800
I don't know.
Is it kosher to ask you?

1926
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:40,830
Have you taken psychedelics and gotten 
into the tank or of course you'd never 

1927
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:43,770
stuff the best for it.
This stuff?

1928
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:46,480
Well this is legal.
That stuff's good.

1929
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:48,550
This one's not.
Oh,

1930
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:49,080
that one.
Oh,

1931
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:54,130
that one's not legal.
So this one's not legal.

1932
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:56,350
This one's legal.
Okay.

1933
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:00,280
Depends on who you're asking.
But what the key is.

1934
01:48:00,281 --> 01:48:01,530
I think,
um,

1935
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:05,980
did get a good baseline of sobriety,
doing it,

1936
01:48:06,220 --> 01:48:11,220
doing it sober.
But my favorite is actually edible 

1937
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:12,580
marijuana.
I think edible marijuana,

1938
01:48:12,581 --> 01:48:17,581
especially high doses,
especially in that complete darkness 

1939
01:48:17,651 --> 01:48:21,550
environment.
Profound visuals like really bizarre,

1940
01:48:21,551 --> 01:48:24,810
strange,
strange visuals and they,

1941
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:27,280
they kind of dance for you in there.
It's really,

1942
01:48:27,281 --> 01:48:32,281
really wild.
I think it's the best environment ever 

1943
01:48:32,281 --> 01:48:32,281
for edible marijuana.

1944
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:38,470
Well,
Dennis could an invocation me in the 

1945
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:40,270
immersion tech?
Forget the Ige delight ship.

1946
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:43,340
The immersion.
Would you do if we got you one?

1947
01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:44,600
Would you,
do you have room for it?

1948
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:48,050
I don't have room for.
Where are you living these days?

1949
01:48:48,410 --> 01:48:50,560
I am living in St Paul,
Minnesota.

1950
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:51,500
Still in Minnesota.
Right.

1951
01:48:51,530 --> 01:48:55,220
But I am moving to Canada.
I'm immigrating to Canada.

1952
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:57,380
Damn.
This Donald Trump stuff.

1953
01:48:57,410 --> 01:48:58,160
Got you down.
Huh?

1954
01:48:58,190 --> 01:49:01,940
Got Me down.
Not participating anymore.

1955
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:07,490
Now that my wife has got her little five
year pension,

1956
01:49:07,491 --> 01:49:10,160
she's able to retire.
So she's Canadian.

1957
01:49:10,161 --> 01:49:13,150
So she's my ticket out of here.
Nice.

1958
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:16,250
So that's why you moving up there.
I am moving to British Columbia.

1959
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:20,180
You were teaching in Minnesota a part of
the time.

1960
01:49:20,181 --> 01:49:25,181
I was teaching at the University of 
Minnesota and then I stepped back from 

1961
01:49:25,181 --> 01:49:28,601
that for a couple of years ago because I
just didn't have time and it was an 

1962
01:49:28,601 --> 01:49:30,290
adjunct professor position.

1963
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:34,760
So the equation between the amount of 
work and the amount of compensation just

1964
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:39,350
didn't make sense for awhile.
I mean I enjoyed it a lot but I,

1965
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:43,400
I've lived in BC a lot.
I'm almost three quarters.

1966
01:49:43,450 --> 01:49:43,870
I mean,
you know,

1967
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:48,940
I got my phd at UBC,
my daughter's got dual citizenship and 

1968
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:52,330
she's up there now and I love it up 
there.

1969
01:49:52,331 --> 01:49:54,290
We're going to move.
Fantastic.

1970
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:54,750
You know,
I'm,

1971
01:49:55,050 --> 01:50:00,050
I'm excited.
I'm applied for my permanent residence 

1972
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:02,140
and there's no,
no reason why I wouldn't get it.

1973
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,900
You know,
it's pretty simple a thing.

1974
01:50:04,901 --> 01:50:08,260
So that will happen next spring as soon 
as we can.

1975
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:13,470
We gotta wait for House,
got to wait for the prime time to sell 

1976
01:50:13,470 --> 01:50:15,250
our house,
which will be next February.

1977
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:20,830
And also time is the winter end of the 
winter,

1978
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:24,250
I would think.
No one's going anywhere and people start

1979
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:29,251
looking at the end of February.
So it's a hot time too because it's a 

1980
01:50:29,251 --> 01:50:29,470
buy.

1981
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:31,380
It's a seller's market right now.
Oh,

1982
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:34,480
that's great.
We're going to go up there.

1983
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:36,310
What part of BC?
Well,

1984
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:41,340
around Vancouver,
we probably won't be able to afford to 

1985
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:44,260
live in Vancouver.
The housing market is utterly nuts,

1986
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,490
but somewhere close by white rock,
Abbotsford.

1987
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:51,460
Have you looked at Vancouver island?
Yeah,

1988
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:55,600
we've looked at Vancouver and it's not 
that much less expensive there.

1989
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:00,310
It's nice,
but it's logistically it's a problem.

1990
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,940
I can go anywhere.
You have to take a ferry.

1991
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,670
So I'm looking forward to hold the,
all the work,

1992
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:10,480
all the travel.
I do need to be close to the airport,

1993
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,130
but I am excited.
I mean,

1994
01:51:12,131 --> 01:51:13,300
for one thing,
uh,

1995
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:16,810
you know,
my colleague Wade Davis is up there,

1996
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:20,470
you know him.
He's the person that wrote one river.

1997
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:25,150
He was a protege of shoulder.
He was a graduate student of shelties.

1998
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:30,130
He's one of the author,
one of the editors on this and very well

1999
01:51:30,131 --> 01:51:35,131
known as an ethnobotanist and for years 
he was the explorer in residence for the

2000
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:37,780
National Geographic.

2001
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:43,350
He's the guy that worked out the Zombie 
poisoned mystery back in the day,

2002
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:44,650
you know,
in Haiti.

2003
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:46,810
Uh,
he's that guy,

2004
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:52,260
but he's written a lot of excellent 
books and now he's a Columbian.

2005
01:51:52,991 --> 01:51:54,850
Devil's dust or whatever the hell that 
is.

2006
01:51:54,851 --> 01:51:55,380
No,
no,

2007
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:57,300
that's,
that's broke Vancea.

2008
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,960
That's tollway.
No,

2009
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:03,961
this is the Saab beat.
Madison is a tetrodotoxin,

2010
01:52:05,410 --> 01:52:10,410
which is a toxin from puffer fish as 
well as other other marine sources.

2011
01:52:11,951 --> 01:52:16,951
It's a tetrodotoxin.
It's a paralytic,

2012
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:22,260
neurotoxin.
That utterly paralyzes you for about 48 

2013
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,070
hours.
Whoa.

2014
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:25,210
And,
but you're completely conscious.

2015
01:52:25,211 --> 01:52:28,240
You can hear everything.
You can't move a muscle.

2016
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:31,810
And so in the,
in the Zombie context,

2017
01:52:31,811 --> 01:52:34,720
they would contrive to,
you know,

2018
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:38,140
give this to people.
If they want to put the whammy on them,

2019
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:41,500
then they would bury them.
Oh Jesus.

2020
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:46,800
And if they were lucky they would.
And then they would assume that like 48 

2021
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,880
hours later,
and of course a lot of them did die,

2022
01:52:49,881 --> 01:52:53,000
but if they were alive then they would 
be zombies.

2023
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,000
They don't give them a,
a mixture of a detour and other bad 

2024
01:52:58,041 --> 01:53:02,960
things that would destroy their memory 
and completely discombobulate them.

2025
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:06,970
And then they would send them off and 
they would spend their life as you know,

2026
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,520
sort of wandering around completely,
you know,

2027
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:13,350
shells of their former self.
Wow.

2028
01:53:13,351 --> 01:53:15,700
Did the Torah has permanent effects like
that?

2029
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:18,140
It can,
it can.

2030
01:53:18,141 --> 01:53:21,500
And after this traumatic experience,
you could imagine,

2031
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:24,590
you know what?
So we'd worked all that out.

2032
01:53:24,591 --> 01:53:29,591
His first book was called the serpent 
and the rainbow that was made into a 

2033
01:53:29,591 --> 01:53:29,591
film.
Yeah.

2034
01:53:29,591 --> 01:53:32,420
Terrible film,
but good book.

2035
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:36,500
But later he wrote a.
He wrote many books.

2036
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:41,530
His most memorable one is basically a 
biography of shelties called the one 

2037
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:47,081
river,
one river adventures in the Amazon or 

2038
01:53:47,081 --> 01:53:51,731
something like that.
He'd be a great guy to bring it on your 

2039
01:53:51,731 --> 01:53:51,731
show.
It sounds awesome.

2040
01:53:51,731 --> 01:53:54,230
Very articulate man.
And you know,

2041
01:53:54,231 --> 01:53:59,090
we worked actually this hair collitus 
expedition I was telling you on wade was

2042
01:53:59,091 --> 01:54:02,000
on that expedition and I've gotten to 
know him.

2043
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:04,670
I consider him a good friend,
but he's now.

2044
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:11,890
He's an endowed professor of 
anthropology at the University of 

2045
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,590
British Columbia,
which sounds real stuffy and it is.

2046
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:19,500
But he's not a stuffy guy.
He's got wonderful tales to tell.

2047
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:24,540
Well,
I can guarantee you that there's float 

2048
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:25,100
tank centers in Vancouver float tank 
centers in Vancouver.

2049
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:26,300
We'll,
we'll get you connected.

2050
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:27,410
Nokia.
You need.

2051
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:29,960
You need this in your life.
I'd love to.

2052
01:54:29,961 --> 01:54:33,020
I'd love to get into it.
It's great physically to just,

2053
01:54:33,021 --> 01:54:36,590
you feel very relaxed and out of there.
My issue always,

2054
01:54:36,591 --> 01:54:39,140
Joe,
is I just never feel like I have time,

2055
01:54:39,141 --> 01:54:43,760
but that's my issue as well.
Change my attitude about that.

2056
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:48,170
I realize that I need to take time out 
to care for my body.

2057
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:50,000
I don't do enough of that,
you know?

2058
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:53,870
Yeah.
But I'm hoping that when I move up to BC

2059
01:54:53,871 --> 01:54:57,110
wait and I can do some work together and
maybe even teach,

2060
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:59,450
you know,
work on this thing in South America,

2061
01:54:59,451 --> 01:55:02,360
gets some courses going down there 
because with him,

2062
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:08,250
you know,
as one of the faculty that will bring a 

2063
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:08,250
lot of people.

2064
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:10,850
I mean he's,
he's high profile and really a good guy.

2065
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,050
That's fantastic.
Yeah.

2066
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:13,760
So do you have a timeline for this 
thing?

2067
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:18,810
Improve a wealth?
It's happening faster than I had dared 

2068
01:55:21,001 --> 01:55:23,120
to hope actually.
I think,

2069
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:24,320
I mean,
you know,

2070
01:55:24,321 --> 01:55:29,321
I hate,
I hate to predict and then not be able 

2071
01:55:29,321 --> 01:55:29,321
to,
you know,

2072
01:55:29,321 --> 01:55:33,230
but my guess is that a year from now 
we'll be on the way.

2073
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:38,940
I mean,
it is all happening and this is the 

2074
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:40,490
formative year.
We know where we want to go.

2075
01:55:40,491 --> 01:55:44,700
We're talking to investors who were 
seriously interested.

2076
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:49,730
They want to get involved and they have 
money and it's not just about money.

2077
01:55:51,401 --> 01:55:53,020
They also have,
you know,

2078
01:55:53,021 --> 01:55:58,021
they've listened to the medicine man.
It's all about the medicine as we know,

2079
01:55:58,341 --> 01:56:01,370
changes people's hearts and minds.
So these folks,

2080
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:05,390
they have the resources,
but they realize there's a larger vision

2081
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:07,520
and so,
you know,

2082
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:13,090
for me personally what I want to do,
part of my problem is I'm running around

2083
01:56:14,211 --> 01:56:17,180
the world all the time and I'm going to 
these conferences,

2084
01:56:17,181 --> 01:56:20,510
I'm propagating the message and I can't 
stop myself.

2085
01:56:20,510 --> 01:56:21,710
I have,
I have,

2086
01:56:21,711 --> 01:56:25,010
yes,
a holism and takes it,

2087
01:56:25,011 --> 01:56:28,400
takes a lot out of me and it keeps me 
distracted.

2088
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:33,460
So what I want to do if possible is pull
my elbows in a little bit and say,

2089
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:39,140
rather than go to your conference in 
Prague or your conference and,

2090
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:43,960
you know,
wherever create this place and make that

2091
01:56:43,961 --> 01:56:48,770
a place where people can come and have 
really rich experiences,

2092
01:56:48,771 --> 01:56:51,200
whether or not they involve 
psychedelics,

2093
01:56:51,230 --> 01:56:54,050
they can have rich learning experiences.
I mean,

2094
01:56:54,051 --> 01:56:57,650
it's perfect location.
Want to learn about the incas.

2095
01:56:57,740 --> 01:57:00,410
Machu Picchu is right there,
it's all there.

2096
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:02,720
Um,
and there's just,

2097
01:57:02,721 --> 01:57:03,370
it.
I,

2098
01:57:03,371 --> 01:57:05,890
I've always liked the idea of platform.
So,

2099
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:08,230
you know,
I want to create a platform.

2100
01:57:08,231 --> 01:57:12,190
Well,
catalytic nexus for global consciousness

2101
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:14,290
transformation,
that's the idea.

2102
01:57:14,890 --> 01:57:17,740
And do therapeutic programs,
retreats,

2103
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:21,850
impactful conferences like Michael 
Pollan level,

2104
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:25,600
Graham Hancock level Joe Rogan level 
conferences.

2105
01:57:25,601 --> 01:57:27,550
If I could ever convince you to come 
down,

2106
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:32,560
which may be will happen,
maybe it will someday and uh,

2107
01:57:33,370 --> 01:57:35,800
and just use it as a,
as a platform.

2108
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:38,130
I kind of,
you know,

2109
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:43,160
I liked the academic idea,
use it as a place where we can try to 

2110
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:46,220
understand ourselves and our place in 
nature better,

2111
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:47,540
you know,
and,

2112
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:52,600
and through plant medicines and clear 
thinking and creative people and uh,

2113
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:57,180
and just make it that.
And then I can be like,

2114
01:57:58,450 --> 01:57:59,530
you know,
the,

2115
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:05,040
I can be more in residence there and I 
don't have to keep running around the 

2116
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,371
world.
I don't want to say I'm the girl in 

2117
01:58:08,371 --> 01:58:08,371
residence because my first thing is I 
know girl,

2118
01:58:08,371 --> 01:58:11,740
I'm just,
I'm just alerting or like everybody else

2119
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:12,940
email.
That's,

2120
01:58:12,970 --> 01:58:15,340
we're all,
we're all just curious monkeys,

2121
01:58:15,341 --> 01:58:16,770
right?
Yeah.

2122
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:22,550
What seems to me that with psychedelics,
the interest and the desire far exceeds 

2123
01:58:23,761 --> 01:58:25,200
the access.
Yeah.

2124
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:30,390
Especially in this country,
there's so many people that really have 

2125
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:33,561
no idea where to start.
I can't tell you how many people have 

2126
01:58:33,561 --> 01:58:33,561
asked me,
hey,

2127
01:58:33,561 --> 01:58:36,651
how do I get mushrooms?
It's just even amongst people that you 

2128
01:58:36,651 --> 01:58:38,910
would think would know someone who would
have something,

2129
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:44,480
but it's one of those.
It's one of those things where we're 

2130
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,830
going to have to wait until things get 
more legal until the environment changes

2131
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:50,590
and it seems to be moving in that way.
I think it is,

2132
01:58:50,610 --> 01:58:55,610
you know,
John Hopkins doing research and there's 

2133
01:58:55,610 --> 01:58:59,611
all these different studies that are 
being made through maps in particular 

2134
01:58:59,611 --> 01:59:02,500
and various other organizations are 
trying to push this idea of,

2135
01:59:02,860 --> 01:59:06,160
especially in the beginning,
working with soldiers,

2136
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:11,400
people with PTSD and showing these 
massive results and that to open up 

2137
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:14,470
people's minds that there's a bunch of 
different things.

2138
01:59:14,471 --> 01:59:19,471
MTMA being one of them,
psilocybin being another and then 

2139
01:59:19,471 --> 01:59:20,800
hopefully eventually we'll work our way 
to dmt.

2140
01:59:21,580 --> 01:59:23,940
Well,
this is one of the attractions of,

2141
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:27,820
of creativeness platform in the sacred 
valley because the whole.

2142
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:33,240
Or in Peru,
because the whole regulatory framework 

2143
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:33,610
is different.
You know,

2144
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:39,150
Peru is declared Iowasca national 
patrimony and there's no restriction on 

2145
01:59:39,641 --> 01:59:44,230
the use of Iowaska and all these other 
plant medicines are part of a tradition,

2146
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:46,570
you know,
San Pedro called watch,

2147
01:59:46,571 --> 01:59:47,950
Houma,
uh,

2148
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:50,500
you know,
the snuffs will snuff.

2149
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,410
All of these things can be used without 
restriction.

2150
01:59:53,411 --> 01:59:55,750
Now I don't know about the status of 
mushrooms,

2151
01:59:55,751 --> 02:00:00,751
but I think with a little bit of 
transparency we could also get 

2152
02:00:01,041 --> 02:00:06,041
permission.
I mean you could probably use them at 

2153
02:00:06,041 --> 02:00:09,661
this place and nobody would say a word,
but if we wanted to we could get 

2154
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:12,871
permission to use them.
And that's the idea is to not restricted

2155
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:18,390
to Iowasca be able to look at all of 
these plant medicines in a very 

2156
02:00:18,390 --> 02:00:21,940
intelligent way and also bring science 
and shamanism together,

2157
02:00:21,970 --> 02:00:25,060
you know,
work with smart Shamans who also want to

2158
02:00:25,061 --> 02:00:26,110
work with,
with,

2159
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:31,740
with clinicians to develop a really new 
paradigm that combines the best of both.

2160
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:36,820
And Michael Paulin refers to this a 
little bit,

2161
02:00:36,821 --> 02:00:39,700
but he kind of glosses over it.
But I think that's where the,

2162
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:43,190
the therapeutic revolution is going to 
come.

2163
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:47,930
When you fuse shamanism and,
and the clinical approach.

2164
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:53,260
And you can do all that there and 
develop models that can be used other 

2165
02:00:54,171 --> 02:00:56,930
places and you don't have to be 
secretive about it,

2166
02:00:57,230 --> 02:01:02,230
you know,
you don't have to be ashamed or we're 

2167
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:03,440
not doing anything illegal or covert.
And so again,

2168
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:04,340
we can,
uh,

2169
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:06,650
you know,
rather than being sort of,

2170
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:08,330
you know,
uh,

2171
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:12,860
what we can shout it from the rooftops,
we want to,

2172
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:17,890
not that we necessarily would do that,
but it can be open about what we're 

2173
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:18,800
doing.
There are also a lot of good,

2174
02:01:19,010 --> 02:01:24,010
there are a lot of smart people in Peru 
and smart doctors and so on,

2175
02:01:24,141 --> 02:01:28,190
smart clinicians.
So we want to involve local communities,

2176
02:01:28,191 --> 02:01:33,191
local people as much as possible and 
then expand that to all the other things

2177
02:01:34,581 --> 02:01:39,581
that this relates to like,
like sustainable agriculture.

2178
02:01:39,810 --> 02:01:42,800
And it's a perfect place to look at,
you know,

2179
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:45,460
new paradigms for food production and so
on.

2180
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:50,510
The Sacred Valley is one of the five 
areas in the world where agriculture 

2181
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:50,750
originated.
You know,

2182
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:54,380
most of our important food plants came 
from there.

2183
02:01:54,381 --> 02:01:59,381
Originally they have 6,000
varieties of potatoes for thousand 

2184
02:01:59,381 --> 02:02:03,020
varieties of tomatoes.
I mean really incredible food,

2185
02:02:03,021 --> 02:02:06,980
bio diversity and the foods that have 
gone global,

2186
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:09,800
how many varieties of potatoes doc in 
the,

2187
02:02:10,190 --> 02:02:13,340
in the grocery store,
maybe four or five at most.

2188
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:18,790
So there is an incredible genetic 
repository of these things that have 

2189
02:02:20,451 --> 02:02:23,690
never really been developed on a global 
scale and a lot of them,

2190
02:02:23,950 --> 02:02:28,950
that's our part of the solution to the 
food crisis that we face.

2191
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:34,900
And also what the incas knew about 
agriculture is it was pretty 

2192
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:36,050
revolutionary.
So there's the,

2193
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:38,000
you know,
the spectrum is broad.

2194
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:43,240
Are you going to have a standardized 
ingredients list when it comes to like 

2195
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:43,610
Iowasca?

2196
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:47,360
Like in terms of like the dosage that's 
work that we want to do?

2197
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:52,600
Yeah.
I'm not necessarily to impose it on 

2198
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:55,991
other people,
but I think I think it could benefit 

2199
02:02:55,991 --> 02:02:56,720
from a bit of analytical work.
I'd like,

2200
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:59,540
I'd like to do that.
I'm also interested in the,

2201
02:02:59,541 --> 02:03:04,541
uh,
the sort of the Pharmacopia of other 

2202
02:03:04,541 --> 02:03:06,050
plants that,
that are associated with Iowasca.

2203
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,170
They're not put into Iowasca all the 
time,

2204
02:03:09,171 --> 02:03:12,340
but they're there.
Sometimes they use for the [inaudible],

2205
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:18,010
there's a whole pharmacopia plants not 
very well investigated that I'd like to 

2206
02:03:18,010 --> 02:03:22,510
look more deeply into and maybe even 
develop formulations of Iowasca with 

2207
02:03:26,181 --> 02:03:31,181
some of these other plants that could be
used for more specific therapeutic 

2208
02:03:32,001 --> 02:03:37,001
purposes.
So you might have one that's good for 

2209
02:03:37,001 --> 02:03:39,010
say ptsd and one that's better for 
depression and you know,

2210
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:44,020
you could actually tailor these things,
bring a little science into it because 

2211
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:45,310
you know,
and,

2212
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:48,590
and you don't have to have a lot,
you know,

2213
02:03:48,591 --> 02:03:51,230
you don't have to have gleaming 
laboratories for this.

2214
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:55,370
You can do it with a very simple setup,
simple natural products.

2215
02:03:55,371 --> 02:04:00,371
Laboratory,
most importantly is the people that you 

2216
02:04:00,371 --> 02:04:01,250
have in there,
not the equipment that you have.

2217
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:06,340
And you could do a lot of stuff.
And partly this is what this book is 

2218
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:09,500
about to the Ethno pharmacologic search 
for psychoactive drugs.

2219
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:12,320
Um,
you know,

2220
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:15,450
I mean,
uh,

2221
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,900
you know,
a lot of what's in this book is,

2222
02:04:18,010 --> 02:04:23,010
is talking about the Iowaska and Peyote 
and things that we know about.

2223
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:29,350
Um,
but talking about it in ways that we've 

2224
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:33,641
never looked at it before,
and then there is a whole bunch of 

2225
02:04:33,641 --> 02:04:34,790
things out there that really,
I mean,

2226
02:04:34,791 --> 02:04:38,610
there's a great future for discovery 
things we've never heard of,

2227
02:04:39,260 --> 02:04:44,260
you know,
and that's what ethno pharmacology is 

2228
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:46,401
about.
And specifically it's the ethno 

2229
02:04:46,401 --> 02:04:46,890
pharmacology search for a psychoactive 
drugs.

2230
02:04:46,891 --> 02:04:49,830
So there's a lot still to be discovered.

2231
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:55,310
Now.
Canada has just recently legalized 

2232
02:04:55,310 --> 02:04:55,730
marijuana as of today.
Yes.

2233
02:04:55,900 --> 02:05:00,900
Yeah.
Did they have any plans or do you know 

2234
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:02,850
of considering the legality of other 
substances?

2235
02:05:03,210 --> 02:05:04,590
As a matter of fact,
they do.

2236
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:07,530
Um,
there is,

2237
02:05:07,531 --> 02:05:09,480
there,
I can't really talk about it.

2238
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:14,990
Actually,
I shouldn't talk about it because I 

2239
02:05:14,990 --> 02:05:17,481
don't have that much information.
But there is a gentleman who came to one

2240
02:05:17,791 --> 02:05:21,750
of my retreats.
I meet the most interesting people.

2241
02:05:21,751 --> 02:05:23,830
If these retreats,
you wouldn't believe it.

2242
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:28,890
This guy is a,
a of aspiring young politician,

2243
02:05:28,891 --> 02:05:33,891
Canadian politician from Ottawa.
He's talking to Justin about legalizing 

2244
02:05:36,541 --> 02:05:39,150
psychedelics for therapeutic uses and 
he's,

2245
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:41,460
you know,
working with some,

2246
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:45,870
some lawyers and so on and putting 
together a proposal to do this.

2247
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:49,710
Mtma assisted psychotherapy trials begin
final phase in Vancouver.

2248
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:51,090
Well,
there you go.

2249
02:05:51,091 --> 02:05:52,500
But that's maps,
right?

2250
02:05:52,501 --> 02:05:56,400
That's the catalyst behind that.
He wants to change policy.

2251
02:05:56,970 --> 02:06:00,120
And the thing is the Canadians are 
reasonable people.

2252
02:06:00,121 --> 02:06:02,910
That's the big difference from 
Americans.

2253
02:06:02,970 --> 02:06:07,970
You know,
you can propose this kind of thing and 

2254
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:07,970
they'll,
they won't dismiss it out of hand,

2255
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:08,850
lol,
you know,

2256
02:06:08,851 --> 02:06:10,830
what's your evidence?
Why should we do this?

2257
02:06:10,831 --> 02:06:15,831
So Justin's a very young guy,
he's young and I imagine he's been 

2258
02:06:15,831 --> 02:06:18,810
beyond the chrysanthemum a time or two.
I do.

2259
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:20,070
Really?
Sure.

2260
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:21,990
I think so.
Wow.

2261
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:24,540
What makes you say that?
Because he's spoken about it.

2262
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:30,200
I'm sure he wouldn't speak about it.
I guess just to guess he's the right 

2263
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:31,610
age.
Um,

2264
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:38,090
he,
while I can't say it's just pure 

2265
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:38,090
speculation,
let's put it this way,

2266
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:43,100
I,
I wouldn't be surprised for people that 

2267
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:45,651
don't know what we're talking about.
Beyond the Cassandra means there's this 

2268
02:06:45,651 --> 02:06:48,951
thing that you see when you break 
through and you do dmt that's very 

2269
02:06:48,951 --> 02:06:50,540
bizarre.
Geometric pattern that resembles a Santa

2270
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:50,540
Mum.

2271
02:06:50,650 --> 02:06:51,720
Right?
Right.

2272
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:53,610
You know,
the,

2273
02:06:53,650 --> 02:06:54,870
the Canadians,
I mean,

2274
02:06:54,871 --> 02:06:59,871
for instance,
to get approval for these Mtma trolls 

2275
02:06:59,871 --> 02:07:01,470
was a lot more straightforward in 
Canada,

2276
02:07:01,630 --> 02:07:02,930
you know,
and uh,

2277
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:08,540
now and,
and they've done some clinical studies 

2278
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:10,020
with Iowasca and they're,
they're board with that.

2279
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:15,360
Uh,
they've done some studies with 

2280
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:16,890
indigenous people in Canada.
They call it first nations,

2281
02:07:17,790 --> 02:07:22,790
but they have,
they have done that and it's been 

2282
02:07:22,790 --> 02:07:25,460
pretty.
It's been straightforward to get that 

2283
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:28,221
work done.
That would be drug hysteria that we 

2284
02:07:28,221 --> 02:07:28,221
have,
you know.

2285
02:07:28,290 --> 02:07:33,000
So I think it's a good place to produce,
pursue this research.

2286
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:38,060
Well,
in many ways they were victims of our 

2287
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:38,060
jug hysteria.
I,

2288
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:38,060
and they sort

2289
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:38,830
of adopted our ideas,
right?

2290
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:44,460
I'll be interested to see our response 
to the legalization of cannabis.

2291
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:46,600
That's gonna piss them off.
Well,

2292
02:07:46,601 --> 02:07:50,780
it'll piss off that little elf sessions 
right now,

2293
02:07:51,510 --> 02:07:56,510
but I,
a just great team needs to be pissed 

2294
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:57,250
off.
He's such a fool that guy,

2295
02:07:57,720 --> 02:08:00,640
this statement,
good people don't smoke marijuana.

2296
02:08:00,641 --> 02:08:04,930
That is one of the dumbest fucking 
things anyone has ever said ever.

2297
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:09,460
It's such a crazy thing to say like that
is one of the dumbest generalizations,

2298
02:08:09,930 --> 02:08:14,930
you know,
that's like saying all white people are 

2299
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:14,930
evil.
It's like it's just so stupid.

2300
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:17,680
It's just stupid thing to say.
Just a stupid thing to say.

2301
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:22,920
This idea that we could go right across 
the border to Vancouver and experience,

2302
02:08:24,590 --> 02:08:29,590
you know,
the host of the psychedelic experiences 

2303
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:29,590
would be.
I mean,

2304
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:32,130
that would be fantastic and I do it 
equally.

2305
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:32,830
I tanked it.

2306
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:35,200
You'll,
you'll see that very soon.

2307
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:39,610
That would be amazing and I just hope it
would have a positive effect on,

2308
02:08:39,690 --> 02:08:40,930
you know,
our country.

2309
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:43,330
I just.
It doesn't make any sense.

2310
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:48,390
When you think about how many troops 
come back over from overseas with these 

2311
02:08:49,061 --> 02:08:54,061
traumatic experiences and ptsd and real 
issue psychologically in that the number

2312
02:08:55,211 --> 02:08:57,400
one tool for handling this,
it's not,

2313
02:08:57,670 --> 02:09:00,700
it's not psychotherapy.
The number one tool of psychedelics.

2314
02:09:00,701 --> 02:09:05,020
It's the best in terms of efficacy,
in terms of proven results.

2315
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:07,060
There's nothing that's even remotely 
close.

2316
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:11,670
Whether it's true Mtma or psilocybin or 
any of these psychedelic therapies.

2317
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:16,680
They have profound effects when it comes
to the ability to disconnect from 

2318
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:18,880
addictive behaviors,
particularly drugs,

2319
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:24,030
opiates.
There's nothing better than these 

2320
02:09:24,030 --> 02:09:24,340
psychedelic experiences particular 
Ibogaine and you know,

2321
02:09:24,341 --> 02:09:26,740
you got to go to Mexico to go to t to 
use Ibogaine,

2322
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:31,780
you know,
and I think within five years you're 

2323
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:34,030
gonna see clinic sad and maybe even 
centers,

2324
02:09:34,031 --> 02:09:39,031
you know,
along the lines of what we're talking 

2325
02:09:39,031 --> 02:09:39,031
about.

2326
02:09:39,031 --> 02:09:39,720
A know in the sacred valley.
I mean,

2327
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:44,730
once you've done something like this,
then you can replicate it in different 

2328
02:09:44,730 --> 02:09:48,811
countries where,
where the regulatory environment is 

2329
02:09:48,811 --> 02:09:48,811
friendly.
So you could have,

2330
02:09:48,910 --> 02:09:52,420
you know,
we have the Mckenna Academy and in Peru,

2331
02:09:52,450 --> 02:09:53,750
but then we have brand,
you know,

2332
02:09:53,770 --> 02:09:58,770
if they meet the standards then we can 
essentially licensed south that brand or

2333
02:10:00,401 --> 02:10:02,260
whatever.
And then you could potentially do one in

2334
02:10:02,261 --> 02:10:03,670
Vancouver.
Of course.

2335
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:05,980
Yeah.
That would be sensational.

2336
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:06,580
You know,
dude,

2337
02:10:06,581 --> 02:10:07,720
I'll help.
I swear to God.

2338
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:10,330
I'll go over there.
I love Vancouver.

2339
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:13,030
I go there every chance I can.
Well that's good.

2340
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:15,600
So maybe I'll see you more often when.
Yes,

2341
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:16,490
yes.
Yeah,

2342
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:21,930
for sure.
I still have to drag you to South 

2343
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:21,930
America all I know.
I'll get you.

2344
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:26,220
I'll get you one.
I have young kids and I'm always busy 

2345
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:31,021
and I travel too much as it is.
It's a grind to get me out of the 

2346
02:10:31,021 --> 02:10:34,171
content of the answer to that.
What does that bring your wife and kids 

2347
02:10:34,171 --> 02:10:34,171
to Peru to parade

2348
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:37,970
around a bunch of hippies.
Now we have a perfect place.

2349
02:10:37,971 --> 02:10:40,720
You know we can take care of the kids.
There's a catch.

2350
02:10:40,721 --> 02:10:45,721
You have a family that runs one of the 
senators and they would love to take 

2351
02:10:45,721 --> 02:10:47,670
care of your kids.
Your wife can do yoga.

2352
02:10:47,671 --> 02:10:52,671
It's or whatever she wants to do.
I like how you say the wife could do 

2353
02:10:52,671 --> 02:10:52,671
yoga.
She's not going to trip to.

2354
02:10:52,850 --> 02:10:54,670
Of course she get mad.
No,

2355
02:10:54,690 --> 02:10:58,170
she wants to track.
Of course you could do it.

2356
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:01,240
Somebodies got to watch the kids though.
Turtle.

2357
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:06,550
That's what I say.
There are people who love kids and 

2358
02:11:06,550 --> 02:11:09,450
they'll be happy to Babysit,
but it'll happen when the time is.

2359
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:10,700
The

2360
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:15,970
positive benefits are so overwhelming 
and the evidence is so clear and so many

2361
02:11:15,971 --> 02:11:20,971
people have these incredibly powerful 
experiences that they're relaying to 

2362
02:11:20,971 --> 02:11:24,661
other people and oftentimes it's people 
that are there like the people with the 

2363
02:11:25,121 --> 02:11:30,121
closed minds,
maybe their loved ones have had these 

2364
02:11:30,121 --> 02:11:32,941
experiences and maybe their loved ones 
were really far gone and have come back 

2365
02:11:32,941 --> 02:11:34,660
and they can see these results and 
recognize that,

2366
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:37,810
especially when it comes to,
in my opinion,

2367
02:11:37,930 --> 02:11:42,930
veterans,
we have an overwhelming responsibility 

2368
02:11:42,930 --> 02:11:42,930
to take care of those people that we 
don't meet.

2369
02:11:42,930 --> 02:11:44,860
We don't meet it medically,
we don't meet it psychologically.

2370
02:11:44,861 --> 02:11:47,380
We don't meet it with therapy.
We just don't give them enough.

2371
02:11:47,410 --> 02:11:52,410
They don't.
We don't meet it financially and this 

2372
02:11:52,410 --> 02:11:55,441
could be a way to heal them to help help
them reconcile their experience and help

2373
02:11:57,011 --> 02:12:00,880
them achieve balance back here,
you know,

2374
02:12:01,140 --> 02:12:02,950
state side of.
It's not just,

2375
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:05,710
it's not just veterans that are 
traumatized.

2376
02:12:06,070 --> 02:12:07,950
All kinds of people are sure.
Ties.

2377
02:12:07,990 --> 02:12:08,890
Yes.
In fact,

2378
02:12:08,950 --> 02:12:13,950
everybody is traumatized with certain 
extent just by living in this society.

2379
02:12:14,561 --> 02:12:16,930
I mean,
we are a wounded society.

2380
02:12:16,990 --> 02:12:20,100
Yes.
That's the thing I think,

2381
02:12:20,370 --> 02:12:23,130
you know,
I think psychedelics are medicines for,

2382
02:12:23,610 --> 02:12:28,610
for the soul in a sense and medicines 
for our species in a certain sense.

2383
02:12:30,751 --> 02:12:32,670
I mean that's why they're global,
you know,

2384
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:38,200
we're a wounded society and we're,
and it's dysfunctionality is now 

2385
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:39,010
becoming a parent,
you know,

2386
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:42,240
through the political situations.
I mean,

2387
02:12:42,241 --> 02:12:46,450
I,
I am just baffled by a,

2388
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:51,660
you know,
a government of president who basically 

2389
02:12:51,660 --> 02:12:51,660
likes to hurt people.
I mean that,

2390
02:12:51,660 --> 02:12:53,980
that seems to be it.
It's this culture of cruelty,

2391
02:12:54,010 --> 02:12:58,320
cruelty that has been,
that has been created and a,

2392
02:12:58,570 --> 02:13:01,420
well,
particularly if he feels slighted,

2393
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:04,390
you know,
he wants to come back at you extra hard.

2394
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:08,200
Yeah.
And it's a reflection of probably of his

2395
02:13:08,230 --> 02:13:09,680
childhood trauma.
I mean,

2396
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:12,760
I think his father was very abusive.
Now he's,

2397
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:15,310
it's his chance to get revenge,
you know,

2398
02:13:15,311 --> 02:13:17,300
and I mean,
he's the guy.

2399
02:13:17,650 --> 02:13:18,920
Kim,
what's that?

2400
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:22,510
When you love to take him for a trip,
you know,

2401
02:13:22,511 --> 02:13:24,550
I don't think it would do any good,
really.

2402
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:26,890
I don't think it would do any good.
Why not?

2403
02:13:27,310 --> 02:13:30,790
Because I don't think there's a moral.
I don't think there's was a core there,

2404
02:13:30,791 --> 02:13:31,830
you,
my,

2405
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:32,190
uh,

2406
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:35,580
I mean I would certainly,
I don't think it would help him.

2407
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,190
Look,
Karen,

2408
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:40,620
Daryl enforced work most with said,
told me,

2409
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:42,450
you know,
there are two kinds of people I will not

2410
02:13:42,451 --> 02:13:47,451
give Iowasca to.
One is sociopath's and the other is 

2411
02:13:47,451 --> 02:13:49,790
schizophrenia.
Trump is a sociopath.

2412
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:55,300
He has no interior.
He's never had a reflective moment in 

2413
02:13:55,921 --> 02:13:58,890
this life.
That's what concerns me.

2414
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:01,210
It's all external,
you know,

2415
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:03,780
he's like pure id,
you know,

2416
02:14:03,810 --> 02:14:06,360
he is a,
a six year old,

2417
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:08,100
an angry.

2418
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:13,350
If we met him at 16,
would you have hope for his future?

2419
02:14:13,970 --> 02:14:14,790
How do you.
I mean,

2420
02:14:14,791 --> 02:14:17,760
when as a person,
beyond reproach or beyond help.

2421
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:19,410
Like what,
what is the year?

2422
02:14:19,530 --> 02:14:24,530
So we have this idea in our minds that 
when a certain age is reached that a 

2423
02:14:24,530 --> 02:14:27,070
person is just firmly established and 
there's no more growth.

2424
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:27,800
No,
no.

2425
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:29,840
You see someone who's a 60 year old 
fool,

2426
02:14:29,841 --> 02:14:34,841
that's a dying fool.
He's going to be a full till his last 

2427
02:14:34,841 --> 02:14:34,841
day on this planet.
Why is that though?

2428
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,790
Why don't we just assume that someone 
lives a certain life?

2429
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:41,210
Has a certain amount of time here that 
they're not going to learn.

2430
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:46,240
Is it just because of our own past 
experiences with these types of people 

2431
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:47,990
or are we imposing a limitation on their
growth?

2432
02:14:48,770 --> 02:14:52,490
I'm very curious about that because we 
do do that.

2433
02:14:52,491 --> 02:14:54,770
We assume that if someone fucks up and 
they're 20 will,

2434
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:56,120
they'll get better,
they'll,

2435
02:14:56,150 --> 02:14:58,850
they're going to evolve if they fuck up 
when they're 70,

2436
02:14:58,851 --> 02:15:00,050
were like,
that guy's a goner.

2437
02:15:01,310 --> 02:15:02,750
Well,
we make that assumption,

2438
02:15:02,990 --> 02:15:04,580
you know,
and it may not be true.

2439
02:15:04,581 --> 02:15:05,360
I mean,
not fair.

2440
02:15:05,361 --> 02:15:08,110
I don't think the way it's not fair.
Um,

2441
02:15:08,390 --> 02:15:10,850
I mean,
especially now what we're learning.

2442
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:15,900
Um,
the other thing that psychedelics do 

2443
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,630
that is a kind of a new thing that we're
learning is neuroplasticity.

2444
02:15:17,631 --> 02:15:22,631
Yes.
It actually reorganizes connections in 

2445
02:15:22,631 --> 02:15:22,850
the brain.
You know,

2446
02:15:22,970 --> 02:15:26,730
psilocybin does this and presumably the 
others,

2447
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:29,700
the others do to,
some of the Fed means do it.

2448
02:15:31,590 --> 02:15:33,400
So that's a new thing,
you know,

2449
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:38,220
you can actually change the conductivity
of the systems.

2450
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:41,700
That's probably not fair to say.
I mean,

2451
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:43,560
I mean,
my friend who came with me,

2452
02:15:43,561 --> 02:15:48,561
he,
he made a point when we were discussing 

2453
02:15:48,561 --> 02:15:48,561
this.
He says,

2454
02:15:48,561 --> 02:15:49,040
you know,
you shouldn't hate trump,

2455
02:15:49,770 --> 02:15:51,660
you know,
he's used to that.

2456
02:15:51,690 --> 02:15:54,510
You should love trump.
I said,

2457
02:15:55,080 --> 02:16:00,080
it's real hard for me to love trump,
but I think the point that he's making 

2458
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:04,731
is that he is.
Trump is not the cause of it in some 

2459
02:16:04,731 --> 02:16:04,731
way.
He's the,

2460
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:07,740
he's the symptom of,
of what's happening and he's,

2461
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:12,700
he's the disruptor.
But the disruption is happening anyway.

2462
02:16:12,701 --> 02:16:17,701
And,
and so in some ways maybe we should be 

2463
02:16:17,701 --> 02:16:18,430
grateful to trump because he's,
he's making,

2464
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:19,090
you know,
he's,

2465
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:21,850
he's making it so in everybody's face 
that,

2466
02:16:22,180 --> 02:16:25,910
that people are questioning everything 
and that's,

2467
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,580
that's a good thing because the system,
it can't last,

2468
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:35,600
you know.
So there's gonna be a transition that's 

2469
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:38,160
going to be pretty rough and trump is 
just part of that.

2470
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:43,190
Not In any conscious way.
He's as much the victim of the Times as 

2471
02:16:43,190 --> 02:16:46,330
anybody else and have expectation that 
has,

2472
02:16:46,470 --> 02:16:49,530
be president,
has his finger on the nuclear button and

2473
02:16:49,531 --> 02:16:54,000
a few other inconvenient things.
Otherwise he would just be dismissed.

2474
02:16:54,001 --> 02:16:56,520
You know,
it was an old cranky old guy.

2475
02:16:57,230 --> 02:17:01,410
The television was fun before this,
I guess.

2476
02:17:01,411 --> 02:17:02,220
Yeah,
I mean,

2477
02:17:02,221 --> 02:17:04,140
before this,
he was your fired.

2478
02:17:04,141 --> 02:17:06,330
You know,
he was the rich guy with his name on the

2479
02:17:06,331 --> 02:17:09,360
big buildings.
He was a caricature.

2480
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:11,100
You know,
he wasn't.

2481
02:17:11,580 --> 02:17:15,420
It wasn't what he is now.
What he is now is he's show.

2482
02:17:15,450 --> 02:17:20,250
He's exploited this vulnerability and 
the political system that we essentially

2483
02:17:20,251 --> 02:17:24,930
a popularity contest that choose our 
rulers and the idea of that and at first

2484
02:17:24,931 --> 02:17:27,540
was to pick the best one based on public
perception,

2485
02:17:27,930 --> 02:17:29,790
but that's not what it is anymore.

2486
02:17:30,090 --> 02:17:35,090
Now it's like we are so jaded as to how 
well this system works and as to what 

2487
02:17:35,951 --> 02:17:40,740
significant and important about it and 
we just want our guy to win.

2488
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:45,500
Now it's our guy and Hillary.
Hillary represented the bureaucrats.

2489
02:17:45,501 --> 02:17:48,920
She represented the red tape and the 
career politicians,

2490
02:17:48,921 --> 02:17:50,720
the one,
the proven liars,

2491
02:17:50,721 --> 02:17:55,721
the ones who were starting these Clinton
foundations and making hundreds of 

2492
02:17:55,721 --> 02:18:00,250
millions of dollars and giving these 
speeches and making hundreds of 

2493
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:02,411
thousands of dollars talking to bankers 
but won't release any of the 

2494
02:18:02,411 --> 02:18:02,570
transcripts.
And enough we've got to drain the swamp.

2495
02:18:02,750 --> 02:18:06,080
And this guy was our guy to drain the 
swamp.

2496
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:07,850
The private voted for him,
you know,

2497
02:18:07,851 --> 02:18:08,850
and this is,
um.

2498
02:18:09,130 --> 02:18:14,130
Then he came on and it turns out he is,
the swamp is in escapable system is 

2499
02:18:14,331 --> 02:18:16,340
completely broken.
I mean,

2500
02:18:16,341 --> 02:18:19,250
I certainly don't think if we elected 
hillary,

2501
02:18:19,910 --> 02:18:22,430
it would all be good.
It would still be a mess.

2502
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:27,460
But the problem with trump is he's 
immune to facts for one thing.

2503
02:18:29,641 --> 02:18:30,290
And they,
I mean,

2504
02:18:30,300 --> 02:18:34,680
the man is obviously diluted,
possibly demented,

2505
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:37,560
certainly a social path.
I mean,

2506
02:18:37,650 --> 02:18:40,350
and,
and very impulsive.

2507
02:18:40,351 --> 02:18:41,770
And this is not.
You need,

2508
02:18:42,030 --> 02:18:47,030
you know,
this is not the person you need to be 

2509
02:18:47,030 --> 02:18:49,140
leading the western world because.
Because he's not reflective,

2510
02:18:49,141 --> 02:18:52,530
he's not.
It's all response.

2511
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:53,370
You know,
this is,

2512
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:56,730
this is the petula six year old aspect 
of it.

2513
02:18:57,090 --> 02:18:59,640
He sees something and he reacts 
immediately.

2514
02:18:59,641 --> 02:19:04,641
There's no thought that intervenes and 
he's often said that about his business 

2515
02:19:04,641 --> 02:19:05,220
deals.
He doesn't plan things.

2516
02:19:05,490 --> 02:19:07,770
He just goes into nozstock great.
A businessman,

2517
02:19:07,771 --> 02:19:10,470
if you look back on,
if you look at his business deals,

2518
02:19:10,471 --> 02:19:15,030
that's the same with Korea thing.
I mean if he can pull that off,

2519
02:19:15,390 --> 02:19:20,390
more power to him,
but I'll bet you it's not going to go 

2520
02:19:20,390 --> 02:19:20,390
anywhere.
[inaudible],

2521
02:19:21,070 --> 02:19:24,700
you know Kim Shannon and the Chinese who
are behind it,

2522
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:26,830
they are very smart and they.

2523
02:19:27,610 --> 02:19:32,610
They basically realized this guy is a 
buffoon and they will be able to make a 

2524
02:19:32,610 --> 02:19:37,471
show on the world stage,
but they won't give up anything and 

2525
02:19:37,471 --> 02:19:39,820
people are already saying this.
What did he actually come away with?

2526
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:45,150
Nothing.
Some vague mumblings about 

2527
02:19:45,150 --> 02:19:45,150
denuclearization.
We've had that before,

2528
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:46,230
but it was

2529
02:19:46,270 --> 02:19:51,270
unprecedented to see the leader of North
Korea and South Korea meet at the DMZ 

2530
02:19:51,270 --> 02:19:53,590
and shake hands and trap was traveled 
that precedent.

2531
02:19:53,591 --> 02:19:55,510
That was pretty fascinating.
That was pretty fast.

2532
02:19:55,511 --> 02:20:00,511
I think that's progress in some way and 
maybe his lunacy needs leads to 

2533
02:20:00,511 --> 02:20:02,320
inadvertent progress or advert.
I mean,

2534
02:20:02,321 --> 02:20:04,900
maybe it's some sort of,
I mean,

2535
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:08,400
he's,
people are many things.

2536
02:20:08,820 --> 02:20:12,660
He can't be entirely foolish.
There's probably a method to is matt,

2537
02:20:12,661 --> 02:20:14,820
he never lost all of his money.
You know what I'm saying?

2538
02:20:14,821 --> 02:20:19,821
I mean,
he really hasn't been at least 

2539
02:20:19,821 --> 02:20:21,840
marginally success.
Success has gone bankrupt a few times,

2540
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:24,870
but the point is that this is a guy 
that,

2541
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:29,900
um,
he's probably pretty complex as much as 

2542
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:33,411
he is crazy.
It's probably also pretty complex and 

2543
02:20:33,411 --> 02:20:36,350
some of that might benefit us because we
have this fucked up system that's 

2544
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:40,370
undeniably fucked up.
It says it's just a terrible idea 

2545
02:20:40,370 --> 02:20:43,701
though.
And it was a idea that was constructed 

2546
02:20:43,701 --> 02:20:47,120
in 1776 when it made sense back then.
It was a great solution to the problems 

2547
02:20:47,910 --> 02:20:50,000
of the times.
But we don't live in those times.

2548
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:51,460
No,
we don't live in those times.

2549
02:20:51,730 --> 02:20:53,160
Mainly complicated times.

2550
02:20:54,390 --> 02:20:59,390
And also we didn't have the media 
situation that we have now.

2551
02:20:59,461 --> 02:20:59,920
I mean,
this,

2552
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:02,270
this is also part of the problem,
you know,

2553
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:05,310
with the social media and everything.
It's true.

2554
02:21:05,320 --> 02:21:09,240
There's puns of fake news out there 
produced on both.

2555
02:21:09,270 --> 02:21:14,270
You cannot tell.
So you've got the trump a reality 

2556
02:21:15,061 --> 02:21:16,830
distortion field,
right?

2557
02:21:16,860 --> 02:21:21,860
Which is reinforced by his really no 
pretense about ignoring what's real,

2558
02:21:24,491 --> 02:21:28,110
you know,
like this whole controversy about,

2559
02:21:28,140 --> 02:21:31,200
about the immigration and splitting up 
families and say,

2560
02:21:31,201 --> 02:21:33,690
well we're just enforcing the law.
But in fact,

2561
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:39,020
you know,
at the stroke of a pen he could change 

2562
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:39,360
that and we didn't enforce that way 
before.

2563
02:21:39,361 --> 02:21:41,190
But.
So he's changed that,

2564
02:21:41,220 --> 02:21:41,580
you know,

2565
02:21:42,390 --> 02:21:44,430
just changed,
just caved in and now he's,

2566
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:47,550
yeah,
he supposedly.

2567
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:50,070
But it's nice at least that he's doing 
that,

2568
02:21:50,130 --> 02:21:55,130
like listening to public opinion in the 
outcries reached him and he's reacted 

2569
02:21:55,130 --> 02:21:55,290
yell,

2570
02:21:56,470 --> 02:22:01,470
but this is my car.
It's not that he cares about these 

2571
02:22:01,470 --> 02:22:01,470
children or,
or you know,

2572
02:22:01,470 --> 02:22:05,380
how many people has he already 
traumatized as a result of this?

2573
02:22:05,381 --> 02:22:06,050
But,
you know,

2574
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:11,070
I'm glad that he changed it,
but I'm sure that was a cynical 

2575
02:22:11,070 --> 02:22:11,070
decision.
Has Advisors said,

2576
02:22:11,071 --> 02:22:12,210
look,
Look Donald,

2577
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:14,250
you know,
you're about to go to a.

2578
02:22:14,300 --> 02:22:19,300
you're about to go to a rally in Duluth.
I honestly think it's coming from 

2579
02:22:19,300 --> 02:22:20,160
certain.
Not gonna like this.

2580
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:25,760
I think it's coming from his wife.
Is this going around to this a jacket 

2581
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:25,760
she wore to a

2582
02:22:25,970 --> 02:22:26,880
uh.
Oh,

2583
02:22:26,940 --> 02:22:29,490
what she say it says,
I really don't care.

2584
02:22:29,491 --> 02:22:30,460
Do you?
Yeah,

2585
02:22:30,660 --> 02:22:33,480
and this was a meeting of diy.
Like immigration.

2586
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:34,480
Yeah.
Kids.

2587
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:35,710
She's been the kids.
Yeah.

2588
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:37,090
What is that?
Is that.

2589
02:22:37,091 --> 02:22:40,600
But is that in some fashion jacket that 
she wore to that event?

2590
02:22:40,870 --> 02:22:44,140
What a stupid fucking thing to where I 
really don't care.

2591
02:22:44,141 --> 02:22:47,400
Do you care?
Yeah,

2592
02:22:47,410 --> 02:22:49,150
I do care.
But what are you talking about?

2593
02:22:49,710 --> 02:22:52,120
What a bizarre,
open ended question.

2594
02:22:52,150 --> 02:22:56,590
I really don't care about the tone 
deafness of these people.

2595
02:22:56,710 --> 02:23:01,710
They know sensitivity critic though of 
separating children from their families 

2596
02:23:03,130 --> 02:23:08,130
and she actually made a surprise visit 
to the Mexican border today to check on 

2597
02:23:08,130 --> 02:23:08,890
it.
See what's going on.

2598
02:23:09,130 --> 02:23:10,250
Good for her.
Good.

2599
02:23:10,370 --> 02:23:11,500
Well,
she's an immigrant.

2600
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:13,210
I mean this is the irony of the whole 
thing.

2601
02:23:13,211 --> 02:23:18,211
She barely speaks English.
The whole thing is so bizarre is that 

2602
02:23:18,211 --> 02:23:22,081
his own wife is a fucking immigrant.
I mean clearly the whole thing is crazy.

2603
02:23:22,421 --> 02:23:24,580
It's really strange.
But that jacket,

2604
02:23:25,790 --> 02:23:30,790
this what?
This is the sign of the simulation if 

2605
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:30,790
you considered the simulation theory.

2606
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:32,200
Yes.
Thank you.

2607
02:23:32,330 --> 02:23:37,330
Real real might be real.
I mean sometimes I do wonder.

2608
02:23:37,711 --> 02:23:42,711
I mean it's like it's like reality.
Whatever we choose to call it is 

2609
02:23:42,711 --> 02:23:46,910
becoming so weird that I often ask 
myself,

2610
02:23:46,911 --> 02:23:51,170
who is writing this shit and can't they 
get a better writer?

2611
02:23:51,290 --> 02:23:51,910
You know?
I mean,

2612
02:23:51,980 --> 02:23:54,890
look,
this is so absurd.

2613
02:23:54,891 --> 02:23:59,891
And yet I began actively considering it 
when congressmen wiener kept pulling his

2614
02:24:00,081 --> 02:24:01,700
dick out this,

2615
02:24:02,410 --> 02:24:05,780
it's just crazy.
That guy.

2616
02:24:06,170 --> 02:24:07,700
I'm like,
this is too much.

2617
02:24:07,701 --> 02:24:10,430
And then when trump won,
I just was sitting down going,

2618
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:16,120
imagine if we,
one day someone shuts it off and the 

2619
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:17,960
lights dim and then they turned back on 
and you realize,

2620
02:24:17,961 --> 02:24:19,280
well,
the game's over.

2621
02:24:19,310 --> 02:24:20,510
How did you like it?
And you're like,

2622
02:24:20,511 --> 02:24:22,520
what?
That was fake.

2623
02:24:22,521 --> 02:24:23,180
Yeah,
you,

2624
02:24:23,181 --> 02:24:26,060
you just went and it only took an hour.
How long did it seem?

2625
02:24:26,061 --> 02:24:28,140
Like 50 years.
You know,

2626
02:24:28,141 --> 02:24:29,030
and yeah,
you,

2627
02:24:29,070 --> 02:24:34,070
you've,
you're in a simulation with artificial 

2628
02:24:34,070 --> 02:24:34,870
memories implanted into your mind.
Well,

2629
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:39,880
the one day that the idea that there's 
going to be an artificial reality or 

2630
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:43,961
virtual reality,
that's so good that it's 

2631
02:24:43,961 --> 02:24:43,961
indistinguishable.
I mean,

2632
02:24:43,961 --> 02:24:47,501
this is almost inevitable if technology 
increases at the same rate that it's 

2633
02:24:47,501 --> 02:24:51,671
increasing now,
whether it's two years from now or 100 

2634
02:24:51,671 --> 02:24:51,671
years from now,
we're going to reach some point in time.

2635
02:24:52,070 --> 02:24:53,360
So the real question is

2636
02:24:53,470 --> 02:24:55,450
when we do reach that,
how will we know?

2637
02:24:56,290 --> 02:25:01,290
Well,
what if we're already there for the use 

2638
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:02,080
of simulation?
How would we know and how we test it.

2639
02:25:02,590 --> 02:25:04,260
We test it,
do you.

2640
02:25:04,330 --> 02:25:09,330
But another aspect of this is,
do we really want this?

2641
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:10,640
You know,
do I mean,

2642
02:25:10,690 --> 02:25:14,080
do we want to be immersed in a virtual 
reality?

2643
02:25:14,110 --> 02:25:17,680
Even if we could produce one so 
sophisticated,

2644
02:25:17,710 --> 02:25:21,520
we couldn't tell it from,
from whatever this is,

2645
02:25:21,521 --> 02:25:26,521
this,
let's assume for the moment this is 

2646
02:25:26,521 --> 02:25:26,521
reality.
It stops it.

2647
02:25:26,521 --> 02:25:28,450
Do we want to migrate into a virtual 
reality?

2648
02:25:28,650 --> 02:25:33,650
My concern,
my real concern is that we are the last 

2649
02:25:33,650 --> 02:25:33,650
wave of the biological human.
I'm,

2650
02:25:33,650 --> 02:25:34,410
I'm,
I'm really,

2651
02:25:34,470 --> 02:25:35,460
uh,
really do believe this.

2652
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:38,190
I'm concerned about that too.
I'm not sure.

2653
02:25:38,191 --> 02:25:43,191
I think that that's a good thing.
I don't necessarily think it's a good 

2654
02:25:43,191 --> 02:25:43,690
thing for the biological human,
but I,

2655
02:25:43,710 --> 02:25:48,710
I feel like if you separate yourself 
from the idea of good and bad in the 

2656
02:25:48,710 --> 02:25:50,040
inevitability of innovation and 
progress,

2657
02:25:50,940 --> 02:25:55,770
it's human beings continue to make more 
and more complex electronics with higher

2658
02:25:55,771 --> 02:25:59,880
and higher capabilities.
It's inevitable that we become symbiotic

2659
02:25:59,881 --> 02:26:02,280
with these things that we ingrain them 
into our.

2660
02:26:03,010 --> 02:26:05,040
They're going to become a part of your 
body.

2661
02:26:05,310 --> 02:26:09,840
We're going to replace body parts with 
more efficient body parts and we are one

2662
02:26:09,841 --> 02:26:12,810
day going to create some sort of 
artificial life.

2663
02:26:12,811 --> 02:26:15,570
Now whether we become a part of that 
artificial life,

2664
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:20,670
we merged with it or it just assumes the
role of the leader of the earth.

2665
02:26:22,380 --> 02:26:25,800
One of those things is likely to happen 
within the next 500 years.

2666
02:26:25,801 --> 02:26:27,030
It's just.
And that's,

2667
02:26:27,060 --> 02:26:29,820
that's a really generous timeframe.
I think that's

2668
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,540
generous timeframe.
Yeah.

2669
02:26:31,620 --> 02:26:32,550
Well,
you know this,

2670
02:26:32,551 --> 02:26:34,710
this.
I mean,

2671
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:39,950
in some ways this is sort of.
This raises the issue about,

2672
02:26:40,881 --> 02:26:45,881
you know,
one of the things that psychedelics put 

2673
02:26:45,881 --> 02:26:48,281
in front of us front and center is the 
fact that we are getting a strange from 

2674
02:26:48,281 --> 02:26:48,770
nature.
You know,

2675
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:52,220
that's the main lesson were getting this
strange from nature.

2676
02:26:52,221 --> 02:26:54,850
We have to really understand our 
relationship and,

2677
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:56,230
and um,
you know,

2678
02:26:56,270 --> 02:27:01,270
become a partner that's in the symbiosis
with nature and this projection is the 

2679
02:27:04,361 --> 02:27:06,910
exact opposite of that.
So is that,

2680
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:08,910
you know,
so maybe you know,

2681
02:27:09,290 --> 02:27:14,290
this,
this raises also in one issue that we 

2682
02:27:14,290 --> 02:27:14,380
haven't really touched on,
but here,

2683
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:18,240
but you know,
technology,

2684
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:23,360
which is what this virtual reality stuff
is and what any artifact is psychedelics

2685
02:27:24,361 --> 02:27:27,630
or technology.
Molecular biology is technology.

2686
02:27:27,631 --> 02:27:32,631
Cybernetics as technology technology 
inherently has no moral dimension.

2687
02:27:33,950 --> 02:27:37,100
You know,
these are not good or bad things,

2688
02:27:37,130 --> 02:27:40,380
you know,
the way that they are used by humans,

2689
02:27:40,381 --> 02:27:45,381
the decisions that humans make in the 
way that they're going to exploit or 

2690
02:27:45,381 --> 02:27:47,030
deploy these technologies.

2691
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:49,400
That's where the moral dimension comes 
in.

2692
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:53,660
Morality comes out of the human heart.
You know,

2693
02:27:53,690 --> 02:27:57,590
and we are one of our problems,
I feel as a species.

2694
02:27:57,591 --> 02:28:01,010
We're extremely clever,
but we're not wise.

2695
02:28:01,810 --> 02:28:05,740
That's what it is.
We're not wise about what we do.

2696
02:28:05,741 --> 02:28:08,890
We're not able to step back and say,
well,

2697
02:28:08,950 --> 02:28:10,030
yeah,
we can produce,

2698
02:28:10,031 --> 02:28:11,000
we can,
you know,

2699
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:16,120
download the brain into cybernetics or 
we can produce an artificial body or we 

2700
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:20,771
can do all this genetic stuff.
Do we ever stopped to think about just 

2701
02:28:20,771 --> 02:28:23,300
because we can something,
should we do something,

2702
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:24,540
you know?
Uh,

2703
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:25,220
we,
we,

2704
02:28:25,320 --> 02:28:27,590
uh,
and the arrogance of science.

2705
02:28:27,591 --> 02:28:30,500
This is also a problem.
The scientists will say,

2706
02:28:30,501 --> 02:28:32,850
well,
they are scientists,

2707
02:28:32,851 --> 02:28:34,020
right?
We can do it.

2708
02:28:34,050 --> 02:28:39,050
So let's do it.
We can do the Hadron experiment and 

2709
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:42,540
maybe it'll collapse,
collapsed the space time continuum,

2710
02:28:42,570 --> 02:28:44,340
but the very small probability.

2711
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:46,470
So let's do it,
right?

2712
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:49,530
Yeah.
And that's something we have to learn.

2713
02:28:49,531 --> 02:28:52,840
I think also the psychedelics are 
important in that regard too.

2714
02:28:53,010 --> 02:28:58,010
They are ways that we can bring our 
cleverness and our wisdom into sync so 

2715
02:28:59,611 --> 02:29:04,611
that we have the wisdom not to do 
something even though we might be able 

2716
02:29:05,881 --> 02:29:10,881
to,
we shouldn't do it just because we can 

2717
02:29:10,881 --> 02:29:10,881
do it,
you know,

2718
02:29:10,881 --> 02:29:13,290
we really have to as a species,
ask ourselves is this a good idea?

2719
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:19,040
And I think again,
these psychedelics are teaching tools 

2720
02:29:20,531 --> 02:29:24,420
for learning this and really propagating
the message from the

2721
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:26,970
community of species.
That's for sure.

2722
02:29:26,971 --> 02:29:31,971
Going to be a meme with a photo of your 
face that we are very clever but we're 

2723
02:29:31,971 --> 02:29:32,430
not wise.
That's for sure.

2724
02:29:32,431 --> 02:29:33,480
Going to be a meme.
Some,

2725
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:36,570
some dude or gal is working on that 
right now.

2726
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:41,780
Well,
I've been talking about this sentence 

2727
02:29:41,780 --> 02:29:46,050
so,
so striking not my real concern with 

2728
02:29:46,050 --> 02:29:50,181
this stuff is that this is inevitable 
and this is just like the single celled 

2729
02:29:50,181 --> 02:29:52,920
organism became the multicell organism 
and that the thinking,

2730
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:58,070
curious monkey who strives for material 
possessions is designed to create 

2731
02:29:58,070 --> 02:30:01,110
artificial life.
And this is just what we've said here.

2732
02:30:01,111 --> 02:30:06,111
I've described it as that we are the 
technological butterfly that will emerge

2733
02:30:08,101 --> 02:30:13,101
from the cocoon and right now we're 
creating this cocoon that we are this 

2734
02:30:13,101 --> 02:30:13,500
caterpillar,
yeah,

2735
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:18,680
technological caterpillar,
and we don't know why we're making this 

2736
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:18,680
cocoon and that we are going to give 
birth,

2737
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:23,571
this artificial life,
this next stage of complexity that may 

2738
02:30:23,971 --> 02:30:24,440
be true

2739
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:25,320
to.
I mean,

2740
02:30:25,350 --> 02:30:26,910
I mean,
what you say is true.

2741
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:29,100
You know,
on some level,

2742
02:30:29,430 --> 02:30:32,980
anything that can be done is going to be
dumb.

2743
02:30:33,150 --> 02:30:36,730
Somebody's gonna do it,
but so,

2744
02:30:36,970 --> 02:30:39,370
you know,
is it good?

2745
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:43,540
Is it good?
Is it good for the collective?

2746
02:30:43,541 --> 02:30:44,470
I mean,
you know,

2747
02:30:44,471 --> 02:30:46,930
they're always megalomaniacs will say,
well,

2748
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:49,330
I can do it.
I can start a nuclear war,

2749
02:30:49,331 --> 02:30:51,550
so why don't we do this?
You know,

2750
02:30:53,070 --> 02:30:54,560
that's,
that's the tricky part.

2751
02:30:54,561 --> 02:30:55,520
Again,
I think,

2752
02:30:55,550 --> 02:31:00,550
you know,
psychedelics are important in giving us 

2753
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:00,590
a moral compass.
I mean,

2754
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:05,950
wisdom not,
not a set of rules about that come out 

2755
02:31:08,001 --> 02:31:13,001
of the religious perception.
A set of rules that come out of the 

2756
02:31:13,001 --> 02:31:14,600
biological perception.
What is most compatible?

2757
02:31:14,601 --> 02:31:17,450
What is most nourishing,
nourishing for living?

2758
02:31:17,451 --> 02:31:21,360
Things presumably don't want to trash 
this planet.

2759
02:31:22,010 --> 02:31:24,510
You know,
we now have the ability to do that,

2760
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:29,600
you know,
the forces that we can manipulate for 

2761
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:33,391
the first time in history pose a real 
possibility that we could and life on 

2762
02:31:33,391 --> 02:31:37,000
earth.
I think it's hard,

2763
02:31:37,150 --> 02:31:40,600
but I think we may be able to do it.
Am I for one,

2764
02:31:40,630 --> 02:31:41,890
don't want to see that happen.

2765
02:31:42,210 --> 02:31:47,210
I had a bit a few years back in my 
comedy act about the origins of the 

2766
02:31:47,521 --> 02:31:52,521
universe and that what happens is people
get so smart that they develop a big 

2767
02:31:52,521 --> 02:31:56,961
bang machine and that someone's sitting 
around and some guy who's on the autism 

2768
02:31:56,961 --> 02:32:01,641
spectrum was filled up with SSRI 
antidepressants and drinking red bull 

2769
02:32:01,641 --> 02:32:02,640
all day.
He just goes,

2770
02:32:02,641 --> 02:32:04,890
fuck it.
I'll press it and he hits the button and

2771
02:32:04,891 --> 02:32:06,930
boom,
we start from scratch and then every,

2772
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:09,780
you know,
14 plus billion years,

2773
02:32:10,010 --> 02:32:15,010
someone develops the big bang machine 
and hits it and that's the restart of 

2774
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:19,280
the universe over and over with this 
idea of the universal simulation.

2775
02:32:19,470 --> 02:32:20,840
I am,
I am.

2776
02:32:20,841 --> 02:32:23,000
In some ways it's possible.
I mean,

2777
02:32:23,001 --> 02:32:24,170
it's possible.
It is.

2778
02:32:24,171 --> 02:32:29,171
Well,
it's inevitable that there will be 

2779
02:32:29,171 --> 02:32:29,171
simulated worlds,
right?

2780
02:32:29,171 --> 02:32:34,110
I'm not necessarily completely obsessed 
with the idea that we're living in a 

2781
02:32:34,110 --> 02:32:36,170
simulation,
but I am completely obsessed that we are

2782
02:32:36,530 --> 02:32:40,340
a relic and that we are on our way out.
I really am.

2783
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:43,310
I really do think that maybe that's one 
of the reasons why we're so crazy and so

2784
02:32:43,311 --> 02:32:44,330
haywire.
It's just shows.

2785
02:32:44,540 --> 02:32:48,920
There's no logical progression for our 
culture that it's as advanced as we are,

2786
02:32:48,921 --> 02:32:51,230
as much access to information as we 
have.

2787
02:32:51,410 --> 02:32:53,330
We're also as crazy as we have ever 
been,

2788
02:32:53,331 --> 02:32:54,650
if not crazier.
Yeah.

2789
02:32:55,110 --> 02:33:00,110
Yeah.
So the age of low curious monkey is 

2790
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:00,110
coming to a close

2791
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:02,570
wonder how much of a limitation our 
biology is too.

2792
02:33:02,571 --> 02:33:07,571
I mean,
you think about what it took to get to 

2793
02:33:07,571 --> 02:33:10,091
here and all the battles we had to fight
and the animals we had to run from and 

2794
02:33:10,091 --> 02:33:13,700
all these human reward systems that are 
ingrained into our DNA and that now here

2795
02:33:13,701 --> 02:33:18,701
we are in a place where we hardly need 
them and yet we still have them just 

2796
02:33:18,701 --> 02:33:23,560
blowing up and exploding and vomiting 
all over the place and these weird ways 

2797
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:27,881
and we have them sort of manifesting 
themselves in very strange behaviors 

2798
02:33:27,890 --> 02:33:32,890
that aren't,
aren't good for anybody and this 

2799
02:33:32,890 --> 02:33:35,000
constant need to acquire material 
possessions and conquer and and,

2800
02:33:35,360 --> 02:33:38,930
and obtain things at.
This is,

2801
02:33:38,931 --> 02:33:43,931
this is not tenable.
This is not something that makes sense 

2802
02:33:43,931 --> 02:33:46,421
in the long haul,
but yet we still go down this illogical 

2803
02:33:46,421 --> 02:33:49,631
road and that this is really just 
because this is the best way to fuel 

2804
02:33:49,631 --> 02:33:54,611
innovation,
are extreme desire for material 

2805
02:33:54,611 --> 02:33:57,311
possessions is the best way to ensure 
that they're gonna keep coming up with 

2806
02:33:57,311 --> 02:34:00,521
newer,
better things every year which will 

2807
02:34:00,521 --> 02:34:00,860
eventually give birth to the electronic 
butterfly.

2808
02:34:03,430 --> 02:34:05,110
Well,
I don't know what to say about it.

2809
02:34:05,540 --> 02:34:08,140
I mean it may be.
That may be where we're,

2810
02:34:08,800 --> 02:34:13,800
where we're headed and you know,
it may be that this isn't necessary to.

2811
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:22,680
I mean if,
if our destiny is to actually leave the 

2812
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:23,970
earth at some point,
if,

2813
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:29,000
if the earth is an incubator for life 
and we're just destined to leave it and 

2814
02:34:31,391 --> 02:34:35,680
spread out into the galaxy and beyond,
who knows?

2815
02:34:35,740 --> 02:34:40,740
I mean,
then maybe this is inevitable that we 

2816
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:41,800
have to,
that we have to do that if that's what's

2817
02:34:41,801 --> 02:34:46,801
happening.
But the question is what kind of being 

2818
02:34:46,801 --> 02:34:47,710
will we be when we do that?
You know,

2819
02:34:47,770 --> 02:34:52,770
we won't be human.
It will be something different than 

2820
02:34:52,770 --> 02:34:52,770
humans.

2821
02:34:52,770 --> 02:34:54,630
That's what I've always wondered about 
the alien archetype,

2822
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:58,620
that big headed thing with the no 
genitals and no mouth.

2823
02:34:58,660 --> 02:35:03,660
That may be what we think of as being 
the ultimate form that the human animal 

2824
02:35:04,531 --> 02:35:06,750
tanks.
If when we do,

2825
02:35:07,140 --> 02:35:10,890
if we do symbiotically merged with 
technology and electronics at that might

2826
02:35:10,891 --> 02:35:15,891
be the form that we.
It's just so strange at that one 

2827
02:35:15,891 --> 02:35:16,290
excepted form,
and I've heard,

2828
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:22,520
I've heard the idea that this,
this image is something when young eyes 

2829
02:35:22,520 --> 02:35:26,991
from a newborn baby sees a doctor and 
see the doctor with the mask and the 

2830
02:35:27,710 --> 02:35:32,710
face and this is what they see and that 
this is imprinted in our mind,

2831
02:35:32,761 --> 02:35:37,761
this traumatic experience of the birth 
and the bright lights and the operating 

2832
02:35:37,761 --> 02:35:41,091
table.
This is why so many of these alien 

2833
02:35:41,091 --> 02:35:44,541
abduction experiences do take place in 
these very clinic clinical sterile 

2834
02:35:44,591 --> 02:35:49,591
environments and it seems like a medical
procedure as if this is a remnant of the

2835
02:35:49,691 --> 02:35:50,740
birth process.

2836
02:35:51,160 --> 02:35:53,740
I've heard that experience.
I've heard that explanation,

2837
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:58,500
but it also.
It strikes me that these things are.

2838
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:03,220
There you go,
you go from ancient hominids,

2839
02:36:03,250 --> 02:36:04,630
you go from Australia,
Pythagoras,

2840
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:09,780
and then you go to a modern computer 
programmer who doesn't exercise and you 

2841
02:36:10,871 --> 02:36:15,871
look at their body.
This sort of like doughy thin bodied.

2842
02:36:16,031 --> 02:36:21,031
It doesn't move very well and then you 
go back to this muscular apelike 

2843
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,300
creature that's covered in hair.
They've lost all the hair,

2844
02:36:25,301 --> 02:36:30,301
they've lost all the muscle.
They become thin and then where's that 

2845
02:36:30,301 --> 02:36:30,301
going?
Well,

2846
02:36:30,301 --> 02:36:30,820
it's obviously going in that same 
direction.

2847
02:36:30,821 --> 02:36:35,821
It's not going to.
People are not going to get more 

2848
02:36:35,821 --> 02:36:37,030
muscular and harder and hairier as time 
goes on unless something radical changes

2849
02:36:37,031 --> 02:36:38,580
and we need to adapt.
Right.

2850
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:41,800
So that would be the normal.
I mean the path would.

2851
02:36:41,860 --> 02:36:46,860
That would be the natural progression 
that we would eventually have bigger 

2852
02:36:46,860 --> 02:36:47,950
heads because we have bigger heads in 
Australia,

2853
02:36:47,951 --> 02:36:50,190
pithy kiss and certainly bigger heads 
than chimps are,

2854
02:36:50,410 --> 02:36:55,410
but no elbows.
He just keeps going in that same 

2855
02:36:55,410 --> 02:36:55,410
direction.

2856
02:36:55,410 --> 02:36:56,000
Hello?
Possibly.

2857
02:36:56,630 --> 02:37:00,110
Or maybe we just leave the biological 
shell behind,

2858
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:05,570
but then whereas I'm really shocked.
I mean what do we are transhuman and we.

2859
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:08,640
No,
I'm,

2860
02:37:09,640 --> 02:37:12,310
I'm not sure I want to go there.
I don't think I want to go there,

2861
02:37:12,690 --> 02:37:13,140
but I'm,
I'm.

2862
02:37:13,150 --> 02:37:18,150
But I'm thinking is like what is,
what is it that's making me clean to 

2863
02:37:18,150 --> 02:37:18,920
these ideas?
Is it that I love emotions.

2864
02:37:19,250 --> 02:37:21,560
I love illogical behavior.
Do I love art?

2865
02:37:21,580 --> 02:37:22,610
Yeah.
I love all those things.

2866
02:37:22,850 --> 02:37:27,850
I love music and food and all the things
that cooking and all the things that 

2867
02:37:27,850 --> 02:37:32,020
make a person a person camaraderie,
but what are those things are those 

2868
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:37,120
chemical reactions we have with other 
beings and natural reward systems that 

2869
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:40,961
are built in to sort of enhanced 
community and comradery so that we can 

2870
02:37:40,961 --> 02:37:44,461
stay together so the species survives 
and like what if there's something that 

2871
02:37:44,461 --> 02:37:48,221
supplants that?
What if there's something that far 

2872
02:37:48,221 --> 02:37:49,931
surpasses that in terms of pleasure and 
connectivity and we realized that 

2873
02:37:49,931 --> 02:37:54,250
emotions are just these,
these ancient systems that were put into

2874
02:37:54,251 --> 02:37:57,640
place when there wasn't a better option 
with these better options.

2875
02:37:57,640 --> 02:38:02,640
It's much better to get your food from a
supermarket than it is to chase down a 

2876
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:04,890
gazelle for two days until it dies of 
heatstroke.

2877
02:38:05,390 --> 02:38:06,250
You know what I mean?
These,

2878
02:38:06,270 --> 02:38:09,780
these systems improve over time.
You know,

2879
02:38:09,850 --> 02:38:10,580
this,
um,

2880
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:14,560
this animal that we are now is very 
different than the animal we used to be.

2881
02:38:14,770 --> 02:38:18,460
Why do we want to stay in this imperfect
state that seems even more ridiculous,

2882
02:38:18,461 --> 02:38:21,610
that would like to stay humans forever.
Humans are so flawed.

2883
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:26,840
We have been.
There's a reason why we have all this 

2884
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:28,990
nonsense in the world and our society is
sick and we are twisted and confused,

2885
02:38:29,070 --> 02:38:34,070
but a part of it at least has to be that
the human animal itself is very flawed 

2886
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:40,260
because there's no perfect culture.
You can't just chalk it up to culture 

2887
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:40,540
because if you did chalk it up to 
culture,

2888
02:38:40,541 --> 02:38:41,350
you would say,
well,

2889
02:38:41,351 --> 02:38:43,960
this culture sucks,
but if you go to this culture,

2890
02:38:43,961 --> 02:38:45,490
it's amazing.
There's no crime.

2891
02:38:45,491 --> 02:38:47,920
Everyone loves everyone.
It's completely open.

2892
02:38:48,130 --> 02:38:53,130
There's no need to worry about money 
because everybody's generous and and 

2893
02:38:53,130 --> 02:38:56,540
everything gets and they're really 
brilliant and they get along and they 

2894
02:38:56,540 --> 02:38:57,280
create new architecture and everything's
fantastic.

2895
02:38:57,430 --> 02:38:59,530
It's the perfect society that doesn't 
exist,

2896
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:04,450
but is that the culture that we can 
create with the help of psychedelics?

2897
02:39:05,700 --> 02:39:10,700
Is that what we're shooting for now or 
humans truly humanistic culture where 

2898
02:39:11,201 --> 02:39:16,201
people were love is what's happening 
where it's driven by love,

2899
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:20,530
not by hatred and rivalry and scarcity 
and fear,

2900
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:23,710
you know,
and that's the whole thing.

2901
02:39:23,711 --> 02:39:28,711
The psychedelics can be the catalyst 
that teaches us how to love ourselves,

2902
02:39:29,140 --> 02:39:31,270
how to love each other.
I love the earth,

2903
02:39:31,271 --> 02:39:34,960
I mean,
I know that sounds cliche and trivial,

2904
02:39:34,961 --> 02:39:39,961
but that track,
that is in fact what the promise that 

2905
02:39:40,271 --> 02:39:42,550
they hold for us.
That's why they're teachers.

2906
02:39:42,551 --> 02:39:46,660
They're teaching learning tools.
They can teach us to be

2907
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:49,150
the human beings

2908
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:52,200
that we would like to be,
you know,

2909
02:39:52,380 --> 02:39:53,100
and,
and I,

2910
02:39:53,290 --> 02:39:54,930
and that's the thing,
that's,

2911
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:59,960
that's the alternative to this hyper 
technological future,

2912
02:40:00,630 --> 02:40:02,030
you know,
and uh,

2913
02:40:02,580 --> 02:40:03,030
I mean,
I'm,

2914
02:40:03,110 --> 02:40:05,880
I'm all for technology.
I'm not against technology,

2915
02:40:05,881 --> 02:40:07,710
but again,
I think we have to,

2916
02:40:09,010 --> 02:40:10,270
you don't have to.

2917
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:16,430
We have bring wisdom to it.
We have to make a situation where,

2918
02:40:16,670 --> 02:40:19,710
you know,
it is not controlling us.

2919
02:40:19,711 --> 02:40:24,390
We are controlling it and we're thinking
clearly about we have,

2920
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:29,450
you know,
this enormous panoply of technologies 

2921
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:32,341
that can do so many things.
We have to think about how do we deploy 

2922
02:40:32,341 --> 02:40:35,881
those in such a way to maximize human 
potential or you know,

2923
02:40:36,511 --> 02:40:39,150
our humanity.
So that's really,

2924
02:40:39,151 --> 02:40:42,060
I think what the promise that 
psychedelics hold out.

2925
02:40:43,230 --> 02:40:44,280
And that's,
you know,

2926
02:40:44,340 --> 02:40:46,800
that's what we're hoping to create the,
you know,

2927
02:40:46,801 --> 02:40:49,040
as a colonel and we're not the only 
ones.

2928
02:40:49,050 --> 02:40:52,590
Obviously a lot of people have this idea
and it's happening,

2929
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:57,620
but that's the idea is to create a place
where people couldn't learn this and you

2930
02:41:00,101 --> 02:41:01,390
know,
and uh,

2931
02:41:02,970 --> 02:41:05,250
that's my hope for the future of 
humanity.

2932
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:10,820
Well,
it's great hope for the future that 

2933
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:10,820
people that are alive today and I think 
that's the most important.

2934
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:15,800
We don't know what's coming,
but we do know it's here and I think 

2935
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:18,921
that's a great hope for what's here.
And if we don't do it pretty soon there 

2936
02:41:18,921 --> 02:41:20,670
won't be anybody alive to worry about 
it.

2937
02:41:20,671 --> 02:41:22,410
I mean this is,
this is the problem.

2938
02:41:22,520 --> 02:41:25,680
So the best way to end this I think 
possible.

2939
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:26,890
Okay.
So great.

2940
02:41:27,240 --> 02:41:28,500
Great Talk.
Thank you.

2941
02:41:28,501 --> 02:41:30,060
I always appreciate you coming here,
man.

2942
02:41:30,520 --> 02:41:34,860
F No pharmacologic search for 
psychoactive drugs.

2943
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:37,860
Two volumes,
1967 and volume two,

2944
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:40,440
2017,
50 years available.

2945
02:41:40,441 --> 02:41:44,370
Where can people get it?
Can get on Amazon and synergetic press.

2946
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:47,340
You can get Amazon,
but synergetic press,

2947
02:41:47,370 --> 02:41:48,200
synergenic,
press.

2948
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:52,680
Anything else to tell people about that
